3147623,4,B0015VTSSS,"Packaged and distributed by Sinister Cinema, (Medford, Oregon), here you get two DVDs, individually labeled in a nicely packaged case; however there are no ""liner notes"" to explain the film.

Originally produced by Mascot Pictures Corporation (Nat Levine), this black-and white cliffhanger was produced in 1931. The film was directed by Richard Thorpe and the music was composed by Lee Zahler (uncredited). Each DVD contains six chapters and, subsequent to Chapter One, at the opening of each there is a brief review of the story. The big star of this one is definitely Boris Karloff who plays the evil Arab chieftan, Moustapha.

The story is incredibly complex so I'm not going to lay it out in its entirety; rather, I'm just going to summarize the chief themes and describe some of the action of each chapter without revealing any more spoilers than I have to.

The Rajah of Rampur (a sort of India location) meets an American, Robert Grant (Walter Miller) and is astonished that they look like twin brothers. The Rajah takes Grant along on a tiger hunt where the former is seriously mauled by a tiger. Before dying, the Rajah begs grant to impersonate him for a couple of days until his brother can arrive and take over the kingdom -- his fear is that his evil cousin, Dakka (Mischa Auer) will generate a coup and take over. The Raja hands Grant a letter which explains all to his brother but Grant gets double-crossed, the letter is stolen, and he's blamed for the Rajah's murder. Also on the letter, in invisible ink, is the location of a secret diamond mine and various bad guys want the letter so they can grab the diamonds.

Grant escapes from prison after his conviction for the Rajah's murder and he goes after ""Harris"" (Tom Santschi) an American who has the letter but does not know how to raise the invisible ink which describes the diamond mine location. Harris also has a sidekick, Bimi (Arthur MccLaglen), who is a sort of monster ape-man trained to obey his master (great make-up!).

Moustapha knows how to raise the invisible ink on the letter and so he too seeks to locate Harris. He has a band of armed Arabs to help him in his endeavor.

Other players in the scheme are ""good guys"" Tom Armitage (Carroll Nye), a young American who already knows where the diamonds are, his sister Muriel Armitage (Nora Lane), and a gal that Tom is sweet on, Mrs. LaSalle (Dorothy Christy) who is actually a government secret agent.

Two other principals include the wild animal curator, ""Peterson"" (Victor Potel), who in a sub-plot, is trying to discover the murderer of his wife; and Mrs. Colby (Martha Lalande) an older lady who is supposedly yet another secret agent. There is also an unidentified swarthy character who sneaks around in a deerstalker cap and dark glasses and who murders quite a few folks. There are additionally the obligatory police officials who command the colonial soldiers.

DISC ONE

Chapter One: ""Man Eaters"" -- The Rajah of Rampur is killed by a tiger and Grant is blamed for his death. Dakka attempts a coup of the Kingdom but he fails when Colonial soldiers attack his men and restore the Rajah's brother to the throne.

Chapter Two: ""The Tiger of Destiny"" -- In pursuit of the Rajah's letter which was stolen from Grant, most of the principals board a steamer which is bound for the African coast, near the location of the secret diamond mine. Murder occurs on the ship at sea. The steamer is wrecked off the coast of Africa when wild animals escape from the cargo hold and the crew is forced to flee from the ship's control room.

Chapter Three: ""The Avenging Horde"" -- All the principals escape the sinking ship in lifeboats and additionally by the aid of African natives who come to the rescue in outrigger canoes. Some of the good guys are taken to a native village where Moustapha already has influence with the chief. Tom, who has knowledge of the diamond mine location and who has been wounded, is in the hands of Moustapha at the native village and is subsequently taken away to Moustapha's secret camp.

Chapter Four: ""The Secret of the Volcano"" -- The natives have turned on Harris and some of the good guys and the latter are all pursued into a cave where Harris and his ape man succeed in closing off the entrance. The cave leads to an active volcano, a possible location of the diamonds. All the principals escape from the cave after the natives are tricked by Harris into relenting on their siege of the entrance.

Chapter Five: ""The Pit of Peril"" -- Muriel Armitage continues to search for her wounded brother, Tom. Grant who has gotten Tom away from Moustapha is protecting Tom in a nearby pit which has been dug to use as a lion trap.

Chapter Six: ""The Creeping Doom"" -- Grant gets his hands on the letter which will exonerate him and turns himself into Chief Wainwright of the Colonial police - but Wainwright is murdered and the letter is stolen again. Muriel is also arrested and imprisoned for the murder which occurred aboard the ship.

DISC TWO

Chapter Seven: ""Sealed Lips"" -- The letter passes between several people including Petersen, Moustapha, and Harris. Muriel witnesses a murder in the jail where she is incarcerated and is blamed for that death also. The mysterious man in the dark glasses, the actual murderer, fires his shot through the jail window, tosses the gun inside Muriel's cell, and escapes.

Chapter Eight: ""The Jaws of the Jungle"" -- Grant gets his hands on the letter yet again but on the way back to Rampur for a re-trial, the officer who has him in custody is killed and the letter is stolen again so Grant is back to square one, forced to escape the authorities yet another time. In the meantime, Bimi the ape-man steals Muriel away from the jail. Also, Petersen is arrested by the authorities and is incarcerated.

Chapter Nine: ""The Door of Dread"" -- Mrs. Colby visits the jail and conspires with Peterson. Moustapha double-crosses Harris (after a brief alliance to obtain the letter) by substituting a fake letter for the original. Muriel escapes her captors and follows a false lead to find her brother, Tom.

Chapter Ten: ""The Leopard's Lair"" -- Muriel re-visits the mysterious cave in the jungle where Tom remains in hiding... but the mysterious man with dark glasses is there also.

Chapter Eleven: ""The Fire of the Gods"" -- Grant is pursued by Moustapha and finds refuge in the mysterious cave where he is fired at by the man with dark glasses. Moustapha hears the shots and follows Grant to his hiding place.

Chapter Twelve: ""Jungle Justice"" -- All is revealed!!!

The acting in this film is pretty stilted, the exception being Boris Karloff's performance which is brilliant. Also, the music could perhaps be described as an arabesque jazzy Flapper's theme which sort of dates the film back to the pre-talkie era; fortunately, it is only played at the opening and closing of each chapter. There are some notable scratch lines on certain chapters while others remain pretty pristine, but the entire film is very watchable. The sound is pretty good too, a product of Disney Recording.

The movie is full-frame in aspect ratio. There are lots of ""jungle scenes"" which really boost the quality of the film but the rather barren interior sets reek of the silent film era. The film runs for 248 minutes total and was shot in both California and Arizona.

In summary, I really enjoyed the mixed locations of this notably old Theater Serial but if you are expecting something on the scale and quality of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jungle-Girl-Serial/dp/B000051S39/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jungle Girl - Serial</a>, forget it.

The story is overly convoluted; the acting is pathetic, barely high-school quality (and unfortunately that includes the performance of Mr. Karloff, who pitches his voice half an octave lower and effects a bizarre accent to suggest that of an Arab); the print is muddy with constant noise on the soundtrack; the cliffhangers are cheaters, where the recap at the top of the next chapter often doesn't even come close to what went before. A friend of mine, on hearing that I was determined to finish watching this turkey, said that you don't have to drain the whole cup of poison to know that it's killing you. He has a point, but I felt I should slug my way to the end. Karloff is extremely lucky he got FRANKENSTEIN later that year (1931), rescuing him from a lifetime of such bizarre and pathetic roles. There are good serials and there are bad serials. This one could give bad serials a good name!",1293840000,,1039,4.561497326203209
8260102,5,B0015VTSSS,"""King of the Wild"" is a Mascot all-talking serial, released in 1931, starring Walter Miller, Tom Santschi, Boris Karloff and Nora Lane.  It is often confused with the earlier part-talking serial, ""The King of the Kongo"" which also starred Miller and Karloff.  Both serials were directed by Richard Thorpe.

The Rajah of Rampur (using the spellings in the serial) is surprised to find that American machinery salesman Robert Grant (Walter Miller) is his double, except for skin color.  Grant and his partner, a hunter named Harris (Tom Santschi) are invited to stay.  They go on a tiger hunt with the Rajah, whose evil cousin, Prince Dakkar (Mischa Auer), is awaiting his chance to seize power, and almost succeeds when the Rajah is mortally wounded by a tiger.  But before dying, the Rajah has Grant assume his identity, writing a letter explaining this to his brother, who is to arrive and take over.  The letter is to be delivered by Harris, but he plots with Dakkar, who writes a note on the back of the letter in disappearing ink.  The Rajah's brother arrives in time to thwart Dakkar's plot, but Grant is framed for murder, Harris having kept the letter, the only evidence that could clear Grant.

A year later Grant has escaped prison, heading for East Africa on the trail of Harris.  He arrives in Lobenga, encountering an innkeeper named Mustapha (Boris Karloff).  At the same time Tom Armitage (Carroll Nye) arrives to report the find of a diamond field to the British authorities, who control such things, but mistakes Harris for the commissioner, Wainright (Albert De Winton).  Harris plots with Mustapha to find the diamond field; they work with a mysterious Mrs. Lasalle (Dorothy Christy) who tries to get the information from Tom, who is wounded and abducted by Mustapha's men.  Tom's sister, Muriel (Nora Lane) befriends Grant, who was disguised as an Arab, trying to get the Rajah's letter from Harris.  Whew!  And all that is in just the first chapter!  As for the title of the serial, Harris has captured and trained an Ape-Man named Bimi (Arthur McLaglen) known as the ""King of the Wild"" to assist him.  And there are Secret Service agents, a Mystery Man in dark glasses, African native tribesmen, murders, mayhem and enough confusion for a dozen Mascot serials even if pursuit of ""the letter"" is a mighty thin plot device.  It would be exhausting to watch more than one chapter at a time.

With all the action there is barely enough time left for any acting, and this being an early ""talkie"" makes the dialogue a little stiff, mostly over concern with it being understood given acoustics and sound equipment in theatres of the time.  Walter Miller had been a leading man in serials for several years, but seemed to understand the needs of sound, this being his third talking serial.  Boris Karloff is an imposing figure if again somewhat restricted by the technology.  And none of the cast has any serious problems delivering their lines.

The chapter introductions are spoken, by Lafe McKee, illustrated with scenes from the previous chapter.  The introductions are LONG.  Sometimes enough of the early plot is included that one would think it was Wotan explaining the story of the RING to Brnnhilde.  But it isn't a good idea to skip over them, since they contain plot details that may not have been obvious.  Once into the story there is never a shortage of action, even if logic doesn't appear to have been a high priority.  The low budget also shows, with some of the ""crowd"" scenes looking a lot older than the serial.  And the shipwreck in Chapter Two is the same one that was used in the 1936 Weiss serial ""The Black Coin"" only Mascot did a better job of tacking it in.  It has been claimed to be from the 1929 British film ""Atlantic,"" but only the clips with the lifeboats are from that movie.

Alpha's DVD edition, # 5579D, is on a single disc.  The first chapter suffers from mis-framing, the image being too large for the screen, trimming a few heads but it is otherwise tolerable.  The rest of the chapters are better.  This is pretty much a straight copy of an existing print, not in the best condition, with several splices interrupting the talk especially in the opening monologues.  But the sharpness is adequate, the gray scale mostly good.  There is some evidence of ""sharpening"" by peaking up the video response, leaving a slight shadow to the right of bright areas, such as the lettering in the titles, but this isn't severe.  The soundtrack is often pretty noisy, but the words are not hard to understand.  There are a couple odd noises that may be due to compressing nearly four hours of material onto a single disc, but only minor defects.

The Sinister Cinema edition, on two single-layer DVD-R discs is still available through their website, and has a sharper image with very little of the ""trailing shadow"" seen in Alpha's DVD.  Gray scale is also better, though brightness is higher and sometimes the highlights look a little washed out.  Framing of the first chapter shows much more of the picture than Alpha's at the top, but a little less at the bottom, the aim being closer to the center of the frame.  In the rest of the chapters a little less of the image is seen than in Alpha's edition, but there are no problems with heads getting cut off.  Sinister's sound has some 120 Hz hum, but remains crisp with about the same amount of noise.  Both editions appear to be from the same print source, with splices in the same places, though a few chapters in Sinister's edition are a little rough at the very start.

This is one of Mascot's most entertaining serials, if more than a little confusing and technically primitive, and if the print is a bit scratchy and spliced up, the serial is quite a find for those interested in early sound films.  It is far from what Republic had in the 1940's, but a lot easier to appreciate than others of 1931, such as the independently-produced ""Mystery Trooper"" or Universal's well-made but somewhat dull ""Battling with Buffalo Bill.""  Both of the DVD's are good, Alpha's is quite a bargain at their price, if the Sinister edition has a little better image quality.",1289001600,4,6151,4.710944808231993
8260103,5,B0015VTSSS,"The print used by ALPHA for KING OF THE WILD is quite acceptable, visually clear with decent audio, surprisingly good for a serial of this age (1931, one of Mascot's early talkies). The first chapter is somewhat misframed, heads chopped off while actors speak, but every chapter thereafter is very watchable with Mascot doing an exceptional job handling the transition to sound.
Also doing a good transition to sound is main lead Walter Miller, the #1 male silent serial star, who along with Allene Ray, were the serial team of the silents, starring together in over a dozen of them! Miller, as the 1930's rolled on, moved into character and heavy roles in countless Westerns and sound serials. My favorite Miller role from this period was his potrayal of Johnny Mack Brown's compadre Deacon in RUSTLERS OF RED DOG. Miller died in 1940 as a result of staging a rough fight scene in a Gene Autry movie. He was hospitalized and died of a heart attack. He was only 49 yrs. old.
Boris Karloff is featured quite prominently in this serial getting a lot of screen time and dialogue. He plays a renegade Arab looking for a diamond field. It's a good sinister role for Karloff and should please his fans.
Former silent Western star/heavy Tom Santschi is badguy Harris framing our hero for a murder in India, the serial moving quickly to Africa for the remaining chapters. Santschi died in 1931, not long after appearing in KING OF THE WILD.
As for the serial itself, it moves along at a pretty good clip, better than most due to the exotic locales, a neat ""mystery killer"", and being a fine example of an early sound serial.
And as I mentioned before, the ALPHA source material is much better than expected and on 1 disc at a bargain price, it is certainly a bargain indeed!",1261008000,24,1766,4.627388535031847
