8107859,5,B000E9X36A,"One of my most favorite ballets, first of all, I love choreography of Roland Petit, second, Nikolai Tsiskaridze is my most favorite dancer, he is absolutely amazing. Petit choreographed this ballet specifically for him. He was a big star of Bolshoy for more than 20 years before he retired in 2014. Now he is a rector of prestigious Vaganova Ballet Academy. He is an amazing person, highly intellectual, educated, with huge knowledge of art history, music and opera and on top of that he is a lawyer. He cold dance anything from Classical Ballet princes to modern and vaudeville, you name it. See him is many classical and modern ballets including Giselle, Sleeping Beauty, Nutcracker, Bayadere, Paquita, Raymonda, Notre Dame, Yong Man and Death, Carmen of Petit, Narcissus for which he rehearsed with his mentor Galina Ulanova, Fallen Angel, Midsummer Night's Dream, Legend of Love, Scheherazade with Liepa, Spirit of the Rose, La Rose Malade of Petit, Afternoon of the Faun, The Bright Stream where he dances ballerina on pointe, Swan Lake, Paganini and some others like Cippolino when he was just out of academy, some clips can be found only with Russian language titles. unfortunately a little over an hour long Piqe Dame and some shorter ballets and Notre Dame where he plays Quasimodo and Giselle in 3 separate parts with Gracheva can be found are as full ballets, the rest are only shorter clips on You Tube. In classical ballets he is the most poised, graceful, light and tender Prince of all dancers I know, with amazing stage presence and in my opinion the most handsome of dancers. See Giselle with Lunkina, Zakharova or Gracheva. He is one of the greatest dancer in history. I watch Pique Dame over and over,, he is so incredibly expressive and artistic with such acting skills and it's all natural talent, talents like this come rarely and should be cherished. He knows classic literature well and performed this ballet the way it would make Pushkin proud.",1501200000,,1969,4.8982035928143715
