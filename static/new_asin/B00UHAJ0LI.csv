8706870,5,B00UHAJ0LI,"The MeTooShow is somewhat of a lost gem of childrens television recently uncovered and polished.  In the opening credits to each episode, it describes itself as a series made for young children and adults interested in young childrenthat is made to be fun to watch.  And it is, indeed.  Gordon Weisenborn works the camera with whimsy and intuition as he strings together vignettes of children playing and actors dancing with shots of the worlds visual curiositiesclose-ups of fish faces, rhinos trudging along and shaking their tail, water flickering in the sunlight.  The four episodes compiled on this DVD, Sit Down, Water is Wet, Where Does My Street Go? and If I Were An Animal are a delight to watch (even as a young adult with no children) as Ella Jenkins and her ukulele loosely narrate the episodes through her warm folk songs.

Its innovative structure and compelling, abstract compositions aside, what makes Water Is Wet so remarkable is the cross section of society that converges in these episodes. Originally shot on 16mm during the late 1960s in Chicago, The MeTooShow was (and, frankly, still is) avant-garde not only artistically but also socially, presenting a sort of utopian space where children from all corners of society play and talk with each other with utter equality.

The MeTooShow won't teach children how to multiply 7 and 22, or how fish respire under water, but it will teach children how to explore their feelings, think creatively and express themselves freelyorally and otherwisewhich are the fundamental components of any successful program for children.  This newly restored DVD is a treat for children and adults who work with or care for them.",1435536000,2,1681,5.046931407942238
