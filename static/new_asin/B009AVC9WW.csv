8538851,5,B009AVC9WW,"Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee makes use of a lot of the elements that make a good anime: Engaging characters, an original plot, comedy, drama, cool action scenes, and of course, crazy hair! I need not expound on the plot, as you already have a decent product description, so I'll spare you of that.

The show is beautifully drawn, with an equally beautiful color palette to go with it and as mentioned, the action scenes, while not as frequent as in other anime, are fun to watch. Tegami Bachi's biggest fault animation-wise, however, are the CGI Gaichuu (gaint armored bugs), which look horribly out of place in their (mostly) 2D animated world. But the writing makes up for it.

This is a shounen series (aimed at teenage boys), so expect some action violence, a little profanity, and the occasional immodestly-dressed girl. Later episodes also have some nudity, but the naughty bits are covered up. There's also at least one Letter Bee Academy short that has a bit of off-color humor. The packaging says TV-PG, which more or less translates to PG-13.

Overall, I enjoyed this anime very much.",1373155200,,1090,4.818181818181818
8538852,5,B009AVC9WW,I first saw this anime online a couple of years ago and i thought if it ever came out here I would buy it.  My score is really 4.50 i would give it a higher score if the episodes were longer(and average anime is 24 min including opening and closing credits this is and average of 19mins. i just wish the eps were a bit longer,1360540800,,325,3.9242424242424243
8538853,5,B009AVC9WW,"To start with, having read the manga and seen this series to its end, there are some differences in the chronology and the way certain events play out. But the anime version manages to resolve them just fine without diverging too much from the story, and unlike some other anime series that will spend 60+ episodes on irrelevant filler, Tegami Bachi keeps this well under control. In this volume there are only a couple of episodes that don't appear in the manga, but are still palatable, as they're integral to the development of characters like Zazie, and to Lag's ability to expose the memories hidden within objects.

Sentai's release of Letter Bee is a welcome occasion for someone like me who has been waiting for a western production company to pick up the title. Alas, they don't use English-speaking voice actors on this release, but I think my search can end here anyway... they did an outstanding job. The discs are tastefully packaged and compressed in their native resolution, so the episodes don't look like someone recorded them off their TV in Japan- grainy and splattered with annoying watermarks. Also, Sentai fixed the pacing of the subtitles so that they don't flash by at speeds only a savant could read. There is only one subtitle glitch I've seen so far, and that has mostly to do with translation issues.

Another great feature is the inclusion of clean opening and ending sequences, as well as the addition of several (mostly) entertaining vignettes featuring Dr. Thunderland, professor of the Letter Bee Academy.

Overall, Tegami Bachi is a refreshing change from other battle-heavy anime titles. It's a soulful story, replete with a cool Dickensian tone, as well as copious nods and references to creator Hiroyuki Asada's apparent love of music, poetry and literature. It's a sometimes sad, sometimes uplifting tale of self-discovery, friendship and loyalty, with memorable characters, hilarious situations and superb music. Who would have suspected that an overly-sensitive, weepy tween could be the hero of an epic story? Not me, but I don't know it all, and to me Lag is the epitome of empathy and compassion... something heroic in and of itself that we could all stand a bit more of. I'm looking forward to Sentai's release of Volume 2 with great enthusiasm!",1360540800,,2289,4.971279373368146
8538854,5,B009AVC9WW,"Very good, I kind admit the manga and Anime both have same features but now I know what really is going on in anime they sort express it more. But My mother felt it was dull I found it expressed some of reactions they couldn't done in Manga.",1360454400,,241,4.041666666666667
8538855,4,B009AVC9WW,"Tegami Bachi has always been a manga that I very much love - I keep up with it constantly, waiting for every update. So, naturally, I had to check out the anime. And how does it fare against the manga?

Pretty well, actually. Tegami Bachi has the same humor that the manga is known for, and stays very faithful to the characters and their designs. The dialogue is brilliant, and the opening song is beyond addicting.
Unfortunately, there are a few spots where the anime falls a little short. The first would be my biggest problem: filler. The manga didn't waste too much time with filler for Lag's deliveries, but the anime already has 3 or 4 episodes that were purely filer, so my pacing got off (wondering when the plot would come back); in addition, the episodes are only about 20 minutes long, so it takes forever for Lag to even get anywhere. And the only other place where things could've been improved were the Gaichuu. Some, granted, are very well done and convincing, but others are so CGI that it actually takes away from the scene. CGI in anime has to be done with a certain poise to be pulled off, and Tegami Bachi is hit-and-miss.

Other than those few issues, I would highly recommend this series for anyone who likes adventure and comedy",1360195200,,1252,4.535398230088496
8538856,5,B009AVC9WW,"In a world with a dim artificial sun,people still send and recieve letters using Letter Bees,members of the Amberground National Postal Service. While most letters are paper,anything with the proper postage and correctly filled out shipping label is carried. Thus begins the relationship of Gauche Suede and Lag Seeing,the ""package"" with a properly filled out label stuck on his arm,the correct postage paid and left chained to what once was a mailbox at the address of a recently destroyed home in the remotest of part of the postal route. Gauche and his ""dingo"",a name for an animal,usually a dog that is trainable and serves as a companion,set out to deliver Lag to his aunt,whether he wants to go or no;his mother was taken away by strangers and he doesn't know by whom nor why and he wants answers. He is,however,only about 7 or 8 or so and in no position to find out.
Enroute to the aunt's house,Lag and Gauche become friends,fight monsterous bug-like creatures called gaichuu with a small gun called a shindanjuu that shoots small pieces of the shooter's own heart. Gauche has a younger,wheelchair-bound sister named Sylvette that he is trying to raise money for medical care so she can walk again. Lag is delivered to his aunt and he and Gauche part.
Years pass and Lag applies to be a Letter Bee. When he recieves approval he is mailed to the capital. Enroute he sees at a post office what at first apprears to be blonde girl stuffed and chained in a cubbyhole,left there because of insufficent postage,unreadable forwarding address and no return address. As it turns out she is a Maka,a creature with big blue cat-like eyes,claws for lower arms and hands and long blonde ""hair"". Feeling sorry for her,he takes it upon himself to try to find her destination that turns out to be a cruel freak show.
He knows she is a ""she"" because she will not put on underwear and getting her to do so is an adventure. He names her Niche and along with something called ""Steak"",an animal of sorts that has a mouth from his short nose to his butt and is kept by Niche as emergency rations,they set out.
The rest you will have to enjoy on your own.
This set is the first 12 episodes of a 50-episode series. Although well recommended with at least 4 to 4 1/2 stars,it is up to you if the price fits your budget.",1356652800,5,2301,4.587378640776699
