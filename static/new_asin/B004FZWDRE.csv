4371676,4,B004FZWDRE,Good,1413417600,,4,4.0
4371677,5,B004FZWDRE,Truly one of the best wwe DVDs I have ever watched.,1405382400,,51,3.727272727272727
4371678,5,B004FZWDRE,"A lot of behind the scenes about WrestleMania. If your a fan, you will enjoy this dvd set. Great story about how WrestleMania got started and a good disk of matches included as well. Get it on the cheap. Well worth it",1392508800,,217,4.190476190476191
4371679,5,B004FZWDRE,"I always look forward to WrestleMania, whether I'm watching it on pay-per-view or when I see it in person!  23 was the first WrestleMania I attended, and since then, I've gone to every one, except for 26 in Phoenix.  To watch it on tv is one thing, but to actually go to the event and the festivities surrounding it, it's surreal.
  I thought the documentary was well put together.  It brought back so many memories, and I liked how they covered 25+ years of WrestleMania history in a little over two hours!  If you've always wondered how this spectacle came about, this DVD is your answer.  My favorite parts of the documentary were the behind-the-scenes look at WrestleMania IX, the evolution of Fan Axxess, footage of fans getting excited about buying tickets, and of course, the Undertaker's streak.  Another part that stood out was Vince McMahon talking about his father; a really touching moment.
  Go ahead and buy it!  You won't be disappointed.",1387670400,,953,4.785276073619632
4371680,5,B004FZWDRE,"Very insightful, very ambitious, very entertaining! Another WWE classic. It's no wonder why they always have the top selling DVD's.",1378598400,,131,5.6
4371681,5,B004FZWDRE,"VERY GOOD DVD I AM A WRESTLEMANIA FANS SO IT WAS A PLEASURE TO PURCHASE THIS DVD
THE DOCUMANTARY WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED",1368921600,,119,4.217391304347826
4371682,1,B004FZWDRE,"The quality of the discs is poor. Each disc has parts that freeze and I find it too hard to send it back.

It does not inspire me to buy online again.",1368057600,,150,3.6875
4371683,3,B004FZWDRE,"The documentrary section descrives near perfect the impact of wrestling bussines of Wrestlemania, but in the match that they seleted, because I think they missed the Shawn Michaels and Undertaker Matches and the first money in the bank.",1357603200,,236,5.2368421052631575
4371684,5,B004FZWDRE,"GREAT DOCUMENTARY, GREAT QUALITY JUST OVERALL VERY SATISFIED WITH THE RENTAL!!!! I WOULD BE COMING BACK FOR MORE RENTALS THANKS",1357084800,,127,5.4
4371685,4,B004FZWDRE,Gives some good information about what made the WWE great. If you don't like Hulk Hogan then don't bother...brother. It doesn't go into detail  for ever Wrestlemania and does have alot of Vince Mcmahon. If you're looking for something to watch and have already see the great WWE DVD's then pick this up.,1336176000,,303,4.716981132075472
4371686,5,B004FZWDRE,Wish there was more matches and interviews as extras.the actuall story is pretty good. Except after wrestlemania 11 the interesting facts don't seem to talked about like they did with mania 1-11. They just talk about matches that happen. The story for the earlier manias are very interesting.,1335657600,,292,5.104166666666667
4371687,5,B004FZWDRE,"For about the cost of ONE Wrestlemania DVD you can buy this DVD and you will not be disappointed.  It is the best DVD I have seen regarding Wrestlemania info and it was really great to find out a lot of information about each Wrestlemania that is not on the individual Wrestlemania DVD's.
Buy it, sit back and relax, and enough the Mania journey... it is well worth the money.",1328832000,,376,4.371428571428571
4371688,3,B004FZWDRE,The true story of Wrestlemania is a good documentary on the history of WWE/F's premeire wrestling event. Its a good way to kill a few hours on a rainy day.,1326672000,,155,4.2
4371689,4,B004FZWDRE,"Awsome!!!! their is so much I thought I knew about Wrestlemania, thats was untill I bought this movie. Wioth in-depth interviews from just about everyone that had something to do with this great event, Its give ""The worlds greatest sport-entertainment event"" a depth that I didn't notice before. Highly recommended for any sports-entertainment fan.",1318896000,,348,5.462962962962963
4371690,5,B004FZWDRE,"A great documentary IMO. I don't think any of WWE's DVD sets that include a documentary has failed. But if I'm wrong & it has, it must be a rare occurrence. I don't think this is one of those times. I really loved this documentary. It covered every WM (so far & I believe the last one to be covered was 25 or 26??). If I was WWE though, I would've waited to release this. More on that later.

Greatest Match Ever?

Undefeated - This is the reason I'd wait to have this set released. Taker IS Wrestlemania. He bleeds WWE. There are several internet rumors and I emphasize the word, rumors, that WM28 is Taker's last match. I'll believe that when I see it. IMO, it's not though. It may certainly be his last match for a while. Maybe a long while. But I believe he & his Streak are permanent WM fixtures. Miz, Del Rio, McIntyre, Ted Jr have all said they wanna face Taker at WM. Jericho IMO is a lock as far as it relates to a potential opponent. When & where Jericho will face Taker is unknown at this time. But IMO, a WM is the place. HHH said when Taker returns, he'd be waiting although if a rematch his to happen, it's likely to happen before or after WM. Cena said he'd like to face Taker at WM30 although if I were Vince or Taker, I would try my extreme hardest to get Sting for WM30. Speaking of, WM30 is 3 WM's away. It will probably follow the tradition that every 10 WM's will be held at MSG as that is the birthplace of WM. WM1, 10 and 20 were there so 30 I believe will follow suit. And at WM at MSG without Taker is just wrong especially knowing how hyped The Streak has been in recent years. And so this chapter, aptly titled ""Undefeated"" is why I'd wait till Taker retires for good. Plus, he could also comment on The Streak during this chapter too which is something he cannot do now.

The Legacy

Hulk Hogan & Mr. T vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper & Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff
WrestleMania, 31st March, 1985 - Not the greatest WM bout. But the significance here is that this was the main event of the very first WM. And I think that's why it's here.

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match
Randy 'Macho Man' Savage vs. Ricky 'the Dragon' Steamboat
WrestleMania III, 29th March, 1987 - A true, classic work of wrestling art here. Hulk/Andre may have sold tickets. But this was THE MATCH OF NIGHT and still to this very day, is one of the greatest WM matches of all time.

WWE Championship Match
Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant
WrestleMania III, 29th March, 1987 - Obviously remembered for Hulk's bodyslam to Andre. Back then, this match meant more to me as I was a Hulk Hogan fan. I still am. But for some reason, aside from the bodyslam, I see no other important thing here.

Retirement Match
The Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy 'Macho Man' Savage
WrestleMania VII, 24th March, 1991 - The infamous retirement match. Warrior wasn't known as the greatest wrestler. He was known more of his charisma. But this is one of his few great in ring showings with the other being his WM6 match with Hogan which chould have been on this set too if you ask me.

Ladder Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship
Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels
WrestleMania X, 20th March, 1994 - Many think this is the first Ladder match. But you'll find out it is not if you search google. However, this could be known as a revolutionary bout anyways. A very hard hitting, hard worked match. One of my favorite Razor (and Shawn Michaels') matches.

DISC TWO:

WWE Championship Match
Shawn Michaels vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
WrestleMania XIV, 29th March, 1998 - Despite a bad back, HBK toughed it out & put on an amazing performance. Austin's time had arrived. GREAT MATCH! And it is here that, as JR put it, ""THE AUSTIN ERA HAS BEGUN!""

WWE Tag Team Championship - Triangle Ladder Match
The Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. Edge / Christian
WrestleMania 2000, 2nd April, 2000 - The inaugural TLC match. Pretty much same thing except for the name. DEFINITELY WATCH THIS! That's all I can say because words cannot explain how I feel about this match as well as the efforts of these involved.

Street Fight
Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon
WrestleMania X-Seven, 1st April, 2001 - A memorable bout. Not really a favorite match of mine. But I did like Trish's involvement & Shane's Van-Terminator.

The Rock vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan
WrestleMania X-8, 17th March, 2002 - Classic match. For his age, Hogan did really well. So well in fact that I thought he could actually win. Though Rock got the 1, 2, 3, both men walked out as winners as did the fans.

WWE Championship Match
Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar
WrestleMania XIX, 30th March, 2003 - Brock's only World Title match at a WM. Angle's performance should be of no surprise. But Brock really impressed me here. I was already impressed by his strength. But I thought he was just those big powerhouse guys that Vince likes. He proved to be more than that. Do I like Brock? No. Nor do I respect him at all. But I'll give him credit for his WM19 performance.

WWE Championship Match
John Cena vs. Triple H
WrestleMania 22, 2nd April, 2006 - I take nothing away from either man. Both are talented. Just don't like him. However, this was a hard fought match. Great efforts that were worthy of their place on the card.

Blu-ray Exclusive Content )These should have made the DVD cut)

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
CM Punk vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho vs. Carlito vs. MVP vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. John Morrison
WrestleMania XXIV, 30th March, 2008 - This is my favorite MITB encounter as far as WM goes along with WM23 & WM21. Watch all 3.

The Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels
WrestleMania XXV, 5th April, 2009 - If I was to talk about this match, I will never stop. So I rather not start. I will say that it was not only the match of the night. But it was also the match that saved what turned out to be a very disappointing WM because since it was the 25th Anniversary, I was expecting more. And this should have main evented that WM too because there was no way anyone would be able to follow this and that it was hurt HHH/Orton...having to follow this untouchable masterpiece.

WWE Championship Match
Batista vs. John Cena
WrestleMania XXVI, 28th March, 2010 - Didn't like it. Should have been replaced with either Taker vs Edge as it was Edge's first WM main event and he really shined.

4371691,5,B004FZWDRE,This is maybe THE BEST documentry WWE has ever produced.  So much behind the scene never before seen footage and stories.  This was a longer documentary then they usually had but the time flew by like it was only 20 mins long.  I could have watched hours more of it and would not have been bored or felt over done by it.  Well made and a great treat for all of us wrestling fans.,1317859200,,379,4.081081081081081
4371692,4,B004FZWDRE,"For years its been the culmination of rivalries, the beginning of new ones and the chance to shine on the biggest stage in sports entertainment.

We start obviously with the build-up to the very first Wrestlemania, how Vince McMahon took a territory based wrestling system and that his dad wouldn't have approved of him doing this. Also how Vince turned his company into a national powerhouse firstly the brith of Hulkamania, bringing MTV stars thus the Rock ""N"" Roll Connection was born also other celebrities that helped make WWE seem so much bigger than other wrestling companies. Also how Mr. T was involved in the first two. How it was such a massive gamble to put the first one on and if it failed it would be the end of the company and of the wrestlers who were on the card.

The success of the first one lead to Vince trying to top Jim Crockett's 2 location based Starrcade by putting Wrestlemania 2 in three different time zones, which even Vince himself admits was a bit too much to do at that time. Of course the third one in Detroit is discussed, the main event of Hogan/Andre, mainly how Hogan was scared that Andre may not want to wrestle the match the right way. The massive attendance of 93,173 is talked about also which even I doubt that number to this day.

Footage of Wrestlemania 23 from Detroit is shown that featured the ""Hair vs. Hair"" Match between Vince & Trump and how their friendship made it better to do the match. How IV & V were both held in the Trump Plaza which was a unique setting after the huge crowd at number III.

The rest of this jumps back from the past to the near present and offers new interviews and insight from wrestlers and backstage people which while maybe nothing entirely new as far as information are always good to hear. Hearing from Vince McMahon, Shawn Michaels, Hulk Hogan and many others were very good interviews and added to the big feel of this documentary.

-Wrestlemania, Hulk Hogan & Mr. T vs. Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff: The very first main event that of course wasn't a great match but it had fantstic energy from all involved and also from the crowd. Special referee Pat Patterson had his hands full and Jimmy Snuka and Bob Orton both got involved at the end where Orton accidentaly knocked out Orndorff and Hogan makes the cover for the win. 8/10.

-Wrestlemania III, Intercontinental Championship Match, Randy Savage (Champion) vs. Ricky Steamboat: Hogan/Andre may have brought the fans into the arena but this match was the best on the card. Both men just went all out and had the crowd on the edge of their seats the whole time. Tons of near falls, high impact moves and a good ending as Steamboat rolls up Savage for the 3 count to win the I.C. title. 10/10.

-Wrestlemania III, WWE Championship Match, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Andre The Giant: The main event that had everyone glued to the ring or the screen. Not a great technical bout as Andre was near the end of his career and Hogan who was always very entertaining was limited in the ring. Hogan ended up bringing the crowd to its feet when he slammed Andre, hit the leg drop and made the cover to end Andre's undefeated streak. 8/10.

-Wrestlemania VII, Retirement Match, Randy Savage vs. The Ultimate Warrior: Easily Warrior's greatest match as Savage helped make him look fantastic in the ring. It was a great back and forth contest where the fans seemed to have no idea who would win and with a few close close near falls it was certainly tension filled. After Savage hit 5 elbow drops with Warrior kicking out, Savage gets knocked around after this, shoulder blocked out of the ring a couple of times. Warrior pulls Randy into the ring and covers him with one foot for the win. 9/10. The aftermath where the reunion of Miss Elizabeth and Savage happened was very emotional to the point it brought tears to the eyes of many in the crowd.

-Wrestlemania X, Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship, Razor Ramon (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels: Pretty hard hitting match for back then. The first few minutes of the match have some good wrestling holds but then some brawling occurs on the outside before the ladder is brought into play by Shawn. Lots of uses of the ladder by both men, though Michaels uses it first on Razor, even throwing it at him a couple of times. Shawn also hit a splash on Razor from the top of the ladder in a very nice high spot. Razor also throws the ladder at Shawn while he's against the ring post, then throws it at Michaels again. Just when Shawn looked like he'd win, Razor pushed the ladder over and Shawn fell into the ropes and got his foot caught in the ropes. Razor then climbed the ladder and retrieved the two belts to become the undisputed I.C. Champion in about 19 minutes. 11/10.

Disc 2

-Wrestlemania XIV, WWE Championship Match, Shawn Michaels (Champion) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin: Despite having a very bad back that would shelve him for 4 years Shawn Michaels went out and helped make Austin the new main event in WWE, even though he was already well established with the fans. It was a good hard hitting match, where you could see that Shawn was really really hurting but it was a very good match. Austin ends up hitting the stunner and making the cover to win his first WWE championship. 9/10. Side Note: Knowing how bad his injury was I have no idea on all honesty how Michaels was able to put on the performance he did.

-Wrestlemania 2000, Triangle Ladder Match for the Tag Team Championship, The Dudley Boyz (Champions) vs. Edge & Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz: What was the precussor to the TLC match was a very good under card contest that helped make and showcase three tag teams. Jeff Hardy takes a massive dive from a ladder through a table and Matt was thrown from a ladder through a table that shattered like a busted open window. Edge & Christian grab the titles to win the match. 10/10.

-Wrestlemania X7, Street Fight, Vince McMahon vs. Shane McMahon: Just a few days prior Shane had bought WCW from right under his dad's nose, which lead to a pretty bad Invasion storyline shortly after this event. As for this match it was the usual Vince match as he took a beating, dished one out and there were maybe 5 wrestling moves in the whole match, with mostly just brawling. Its actually a pretty good match that see Shane hit the coast to coast on his dad and makes the cover to win the match. 9/10.

-Wrestlemania X8, Icon vs. Icon, The Rock vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan: Should've been the main event as both guys had the crowd in the palm of their hand. The crowd reaction did make this match seem a whole lot better than it honestly was, not that it was terrible or even average but its not an all time classic in my opinion. Hogan gets such a huge reaction that The Rock has to heel on the crowd, no matter what the announcers said it was not a mixed response. After hulking up and hitting the leg drop for 2, Hogan misses a second leg drop, Rock hits his third Rock Bottom and the People's Elbow for the win. 9/10, a couple of extra points for the crowd's constant energy.

-Wrestlemania XIX, WWE Championship Match, Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. Brock Lesnar: Great main event, great wrestling, just great everything. Plenty of submission moves are used by both men and each one almost has the other beat on numerous occasions. Loved the fact that Angle went totally gung-ho during the match, despite the fact that he needed neck surgery. Lesnar goes for a shooting star press and doesn't quite get the distance to hit Angle and Lesnar seems to jack his neck really, really, really bad, then Angle goes for the cover but Brock kicks out and somehow hits an F-5 on Angle, the third of the match for the win, to become the WWE champion for the second time. 11/10. On a side note, being from Washington, this PPV was in Seattle, Wa., and when I saw this live on PPV I honestly thought as did the crowd that Lesnar had broken his neck and after the match he didn't look like he knew where he was.

-Wrestlemania 22, WWE Championship Match, John Cena (Champion) vs. Triple H: Great entrances by both men and this was a good main event. The crowd was soundly behind Triple H and it showed everytime he hit a move on Cena they cheered. Cena tried hard but he's not the best wrestler and Triple H made him look like a million bucks. Cena ends up making Triple H tap out to the STFU to retain his title. 9/10.

Blu-ray Exclusive Matches and Extras

-Wrestlemania XXIV, Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Carlito vs. CM Punk vs. MVP vs. Mr. Kennedy: This was supposed to include Jeff Hardy but he stupidly got suspended for drug use so he was out (nice job since it appeared he was slotted to win this). Anyways as for the match itself it had the usual high spots including Morrison hitting a moonsault to the outside while holding a ladder. Every guy got their spots in and Shelton took a nasty bump off one ladder through another ladder set up on the outside. Matt Hardy does make a shocking appearance preventing MVP (who injured him months back) from winning. CM Punk pulls Jericho's legs into the rungs of the ladder and climbs to retrieve the briefcase. 9/10.

-Wrestlemania 25, Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker: Whatever I say will pale in comparison to the match itself. From the entrances for both men, to the the numerous close falls, to Taker's dive over the top rope and landing on his head, to Michaels kicking out of a Tombstone and being the one man you felt could end the undefeated streak and he almost did. It goes for 30 minutes of high impact action, Taker hits a second Tombstone and finally keeps Michaels down for three. 11/10.

-Wrestlemania 26, WWE Championship Match, Batista (Champion) vs. John Cena: Despite only one other main event clash (Summerslam '08, I'm ignoring Batista's run in after the Elimination Chamber match a month before this), these two worked quite well and actually put on some decent wrestling in this contest. Sure Batista was more power than anything and he used that well but this told a story of Batista beating down Cena who just didn't quit and was finally able to lock on the STFU and Batista taps out so Cena wins. 9/10.

Extras

-Gene Okerlund Interviews Liberace: Cool time capsule here.

-Underestimating the crowd at Wrestlemania IX: Great piece where we find out how some of the staff had to become ticket takers so the crowd go into the show on time.

-Bobby Heenan's Wild Ride: Funny stuff with Bobby riding a camel into the stadium at Wrestlemania IX.

-Rey Mysterio on His Wrestlemania Outfits: Cool stuff hearing about what inspires him to wear whatever outfit at the biggest show of the year.

-John Cena on Making His Entrance: Nice piece about the different and grand entrances Cena has made at every Wrestlemania he's wrestled in.

-Edge on Facing The Undertaker at Wrestlemania: Great stuff here as Edge talks about how big it felt to be in his first Wrestlemania main event.

-Bret Hart on His Return To Wrestlemania: Loved hearing this especially since most people including Bret thought it would never happen.

-""My Favorite Wrestlemania Moment"": Good piece as various superstars talk about what stands out for them from all the Wrestlemania's.

It may not be the most informative and deep documentary like it could've been, but it is a good look at the biggest PPV of them all, Wrestlemania. The matches while on other DVD's obviously are also good but they could've added one or two more on each disc and maybe some deleted scenes on the first disc. But like I said its a good set, the Blu-ray extras makes this a good purchase as well.",1314144000,,11657,4.545064377682404
4371693,4,B004FZWDRE,"This is one of the best dvd sets the WWE has ever released. This collection tells us how each WM was set up, and in my opinion the early ones up to maybe WM 20, were the best. If your an Old-School fan or just climbed aboard, it's a great dvd to not only have in your collection, but you can re-live the magic!",1308700800,,310,3.859375
4371694,5,B004FZWDRE,"I definitely enjoyed this DVD, because it gives you a great background on what the landscape was back in the day and what Wrestlemania had to go through in order to be successful and be the great event that it is today.  It also includes some of the greatest matches that WrestleMania had to offer like the Austin vs HBK battle in 98', Macho Man vs Ricky Steamboat and of course the great TLC match between the Hardy's, Edge & Christian and the Dudley's in 2000.",1308614400,,462,4.372093023255814
4371695,3,B004FZWDRE,"I was disappointed in the documentary.  Despite some very interesting spots, it comes off as more of a polished fluff piece for wrestling fans.  The WWE has apparently never been shy about exaggeration.  Even this DVD promises their fans a running time of 9 hours but actually delivers only about 7 hours.  The first disc features the documentary running a little over two hours.  The second and third discs feature almost 5 hours of matches selected from the Wrestlemania events.",1306454400,8,480,4.95
4371699,5,B004FZWDRE,"Quick Review:  This video comes in at just over 2 hours long and being able to squeeze over 25 years of amazing moments into this time would be tough, but I think they did it justice without going into too much detail to bore people. How they managed to jump between the different Wrestlemania's without just going through the numbers is great in my opinion, as it keeps it fresh and you don't know where it will go next. However there are some Wrestlemania's that I don't think they showed enough clips of and seem to skip straight through it.

The True Story of Wrestlemania is an extremely well crafted and polished documentary that does the legacy and history of Wrestlemania proud, this is a must for any WWE fan. Buy it or rent it, just watch it.",1304035200,,752,4.442028985507246

THE TRUE STORY OF WRESTLEMANIA

This has got to be one of the better releases from WWE in a while with a great documentary that lasts for a while and gives you a lot of cool info. We get to go through every Wrestlemania one by one with some detail on each like how it came about or stories from it from the people who were there. You get to hear from other wrestlers about their matches and matches that they watched and looked up to. I personally would have liked maybe a three hour doc with some more detail added to each event but fro what we get it is well worth the price. You also get some additional stories in the special features like Bret Hart speaking about his return, which should have been in the main documentary.

1. RODDY PIPER & PAUL ORNDORFF VS HULK HOGAN & MR. T- the very first main event in Mania history and still one of the most fun. Piper of course had Bob Orton in his corner and Hulk and T had Jimmy Snuka. T and Piper actually had real heat and still do from what I can tell, not sure on that. I still to this day watch it and want Piper and Orndorff to win and crush those two. Also this is still one of the most entertaining bouts ever, the action is great and even T being there makes sense. Of course we all know Hogan and T won due to Orton hitting Orndorff on accident with his cast, but man what a fun match.

2.[I-C TITLE]RANDY SAVAGE VS RICKY STEAMBOAT-one of the all time greatest matches ever between two of the greatest ever. This was the match as we all know that stole the show at the third Wrestlemania, topping even the main event in my opinion. Macho Man Randy Savage is one of my favorite wrestlers ever, and he was brilliant here with the Dragon. Honestly the action here is so well done and back and forth that I really recommend this match to even a non wrestling fan. And although Randy Savage really won this match numerous times as Jesse Ventura points out during the commentary it is cool that in the end Steamboat wins. It really is an amazing match even with The Animal's interference, highly recommended. Also I don't know why the champ came out first and the challenger second.

3.[WWF TITLE]HULK HOGAN VS ANDRE THE GIANT-the match that every one wanted to see, even though really it had already happened. Still after Andre turned heel and turning against Hogan it made for one of the biggest attractions in WWE history. Andre was 15 years or so undefeated and Hogan was the biggest wrestling star on the planet so for them to clash it was like Titans. Now I have never been a Hogan fan but I can't deny that he is a great showman, and the stare down here in the beginning with Andre is legendary. The match itself was legendary as well and while not a technical great it is still a classic for sure, even with Hogan beating Andre.

4.[RETIREMENT MATCH]RANDY SAVAGE VS THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR-this one here is kinda bitter sweat every time I watch it, good because of the aftermath of the match but bad because Savage lost. I remember watching this and being so sure that Warrior was on his way out, I mean come on Randy Savage is the man. The feud these two had was excellent and was Warrior's best opponent. This is in my opinion Warrior's best match along with his title victory over Hogan, still this one tops that. This is one of the best matches on the set for sure, very entertaining match. Also I hate that Warrior after having such a great match does the pin fall with one foot on Savage. Still I guess the aftermath with Liz [R.I.P.] makes up for everything.

5.[I-C TITLE LADDER MATCH]SHAWN MICHAELS VS RAZOR RAMON-the first legendary ladder match at Wrestlemania and what a classic it was. The story here was who is the real I-C champion, Shawn or Razor. Shawn had been the I-C champ and ended up getting suspended from the WWF, in his absence Razor won the vacant I-C title. When HBK returned some time later he refused to acknowledge any one else but him self as the rightful champion. He even came to the ring with his original belt, so two I-C titles were lifted above the ring in this match. The match is pure brilliance with both guys doing a great job but Shawn was the one stealing the show as he would always do. Although the rightful champ lost this match [HBK] it is still a classic.

6.[WWF TITLE]SHAWN MICHAELS VS STEVE AUSTIN-I will never forget this match here as I was sure Shawn would beat Austin no problem. I was living in San Antonio at the time and remember this like it was yesterday. Of course I didn't know at the time that this was going to be Shawn's last match for four years. HBK fought through legit pain with a back injury that put him out for years. That match its self is like all of Shawn's matches, great. Austin was the perfect opponent and he provided an excellent performance with Mr. Wrestlemania.

7.[TAG TEAM TITLE LADDER MATCH]THE DUDLEY BOYZ VS THE HARDY BOYZ VS EDGE & CHRISTIAN-the match that started it all with these three really, the pre TLC ladder match is what we have here. These teams put on one of the greatest matches of all time in this ladder match. The action was quick and high spots are seen throughout the entire match, the entire match is basically a highlight. There are some crazy moments in this match and of course my boys Edge & Christian won.

8.[STREET FIGHT]VINCE MCMAHON VS SHANE MCMAHON-this match had all kinds of things going on with storylines and action combined. Also for two non wrestlers this is actually one of the most entertaining matches on the set and of all time. Both of these guys and every one involved stepped their game up. Mick Foley as the ref, Linda and Steph at ringside and Trish in the mix as well. Everything they could think of to make this match more dramatic was put into play, including Shane's excellent performance here.

9. THE ROCK VS HULK HOGAN- now I remember when I watched this one up in Maryland all I could do was wish The Rock would destroy Hogan and send him home. What I got was one of the most memorable clashes of all time, the fans that night made that match what it is. It was because of the fans emotion that they felt in the arena that night that match became timeless, that shot of them two face to face looking at the fans at opposite directions is classic. The start of this match is brilliant as ever time Hogan knocks down The Rock he starts his posing which puts the fans in a frenzy, The Rock doing the same thing is great. Action wise The Rock controls this match obviously since Hulk is a bit older, but Hogan holds his own in there. The Rock comes out on top when the thing end and shakes hands with Hogan afterwards, the emotion alone makes this a classic.

10.[WWE TITLE]KURT ANGLE VS BROCK LESNAR-I know I have said this so many times in this review but this is also a wonderful choice for the set and is one of the best matches possible for it. I am a huge Angle fan and Lesnar has always been a beast, so when these two faced off at Mania I knew it would be a classic. This is a great match with excellent technical wrestling as the two actual wrestlers go at it. What most people remember from this one is the shooting star press that Lesnar attempted and missed. In doing so he suffered a concussion for real and yet still finished the match winning the title. It should also be noted that Kurt was working the entire match through an injury.

11.[WWE TITLE]JOHN CENA VS TRIPLE H-one of the most emotionally charged matches at least from the fans in attendance stand point. They are very vocal throughout this match for both wrestlers here, sometimes funny others annoying in my opinion. The entrances here are cool as well I guess with HHH's King of Kings entrance and the CM Punk assisted gangster entrance for Cena. The match its self is actually very good for being pretty basic, the fans make it that way I guess. The match is basically a brawl with high impact moves and Cena's submissions. I love the way both guys played the crowd thought which made the ending with Cena winning even better.

12.[MITB LADDER MATCH]CHRIS JERICHO VS CM PUNK VS SHELTON BENJAMIN VS JOHN MORRISON VS CARLITO VS MVP VS MR. ANDERSON-these Money in the Bank ladder matches at Mania were always a highlight of the night. You could say it was because of all the highlight reel moments or because of the talent mixed in every year but what ever it was it was good. This was no exception as there are all kinds of high spots and tense moments and some great athletes in the match. This of course was the year Punk would win it but I also must point out the return of Matt Hardy here.

13. UNDERTAKER VS SHAWN MICHAELS- of course any one who watches wrestling can tell you that this is possibly the greatest match in the history of Mania. It is also one of the greatest matches period, and that means of all time. I remember watching this one live and thinking man these guys are stealing the show. I was super tense, excited, and basically in awe of the performance these two put forth. They told an excellent story in the ring that night and the psychology was brilliant. The action was amazing and it looked like Taker almost killed himself at one point. Excellent match that is one of the all time greats, classic.

14.[WWE TITLE]BATISTA VS JOHN CENA- once again the champ comes out first and I will never understand why that is, although Cena's entrance as normal is great. Now I will admit that I am a fan of Cena and always have been, I wish he would go heel again, and Batista is so much better as a heel in my opinion. I knew that on this stage these two would deliver a great match especially for these two. Of course I was right and the match was actually suspense full at points and you could see the crowd was really into this one. The action was good with near fall after near fall that eventually went to Cena winning the match. I thought this was a really good match and worthy of being on this card.

This was a really good set with some great matches but I must say some of the greatest ever were left off. Two in particular both with Bret Hart with the first being his Mania 8 match against Roddy Piper for the I-C title. And of course his Mania 10 match against his brother Owen, both classics.",1302912000,2,10199,4.345931758530184
4371701,4,B004FZWDRE,"The True Story of WrestleMania takes us behind the scenes of one of sports entertainment's biggest annual events. This is a great documentary of how this spectacle came to be, and shows many highlights of the past 26 years of WrestleMania. As far as all of WWE's Documentary releases are concerned, this is probably in my top 10 for sure. There are many interviews with people behind the scenes and concepts of this event, as well as interviews with various SuperStars discussing their perspectives on it. I was fortunate enough to attend WrestleMania 25 in Houston, TX to witness the event first hand.

My only gripe, if any, would be to spend a little more time on WrestleManias that didn't get as much highlight on this documentary as others did. Other than that it was a very well, put together Blu Ray set, with many extras such as WrestleMania matches and moments. I recommend to anyone who is a current WWE fan or who enjoys the ""old school"" goodness such as myself.",1302566400,,973,4.656976744186046
4371702,3,B004FZWDRE,well i was looking foward in getting this dvd and when i did. man i wished i didn't and just watched it on the internet cuz they dvd blew bad..i gave it 3 stars cuz its a somewhat of a collection to add but the dvd is bad only the first like 40min is good when talking about wrestlemania 1-3 then once wm 4 etc roll on they kill it and don't even mention some wm's either and disc 2 and 3 has matches that i already had in my wrestlemanian dvds sooo id say if u don't have wm matches then get the dvd but if u have all the wm's don't bother gettting this dvd for the good 40min only,1301961600,,582,3.778688524590164
4371703,3,B004FZWDRE,"this was a good dvd but not great. the match selection sucked. Austin and The Rock fought at 3 Wrestlemanias and not one of those matches are included in the matches that were chosen to be showcased in this dvd/bluray, Come on now.. WWE always puts the same matches on the dvd extras every time they come out with something like this. 26 Wrestlemanias (this came out b4 27) and they showcase the same matches?! come on now. WWE drop the ball with the match selections for sure.",1301875200,,477,4.431818181818182
4371704,3,B004FZWDRE,"I doubt one documentary could ever present the whole truth and nothing but the truth (as R-Truth might say). This latest version is just that--simply, the most updated.

If a fan wants a more complete look at what it took to bring each event to the WWE Universe, as well as some real interesting trivia and insight into the match booking, I would first direct that person to finding a copy of the 5-star, coffee table sized book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WrestleMania-The-Official-Insider-s-Story/dp/0060393874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WrestleMania: The Official Insider's Story</a>. Next, try and locate a used copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-WrestleMania-2000/dp/6305994781/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE WrestleMania 2000</a>. The second disc of the 2-disc DVD set contained a real nice look at some of each 'Mania's key match(es) through 'Mania XV--complete with various commentary by superstars and other personalities. In fact a few of the commentaries on the blu-ray are directly from that WrestleMania overview.

Finally, highly acclaimed books by various WWE superstars like Mick Foley, Bret Hart, Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels, Edge, Steve Austin, et al. provide loads of details about backstage happenings and context for matches they were in (and others' as well). Of course, it is from their point of view and some superstars will always carry legit grudges against some guys for one reason or another. But most of them are pretty on the level.

The other reason I bought this documentary--specifically the blu-ray version--is to get some of the older matches in the blu-ray format. (I won't get into the match listing since other reviewers will do that, or comment on the matches themselves since all of them deserve to be on these discs.) I didn't expect anything before WrestleMania XXIV to be truly HD; the matches from older WrestleManias included on the disc definitely look lots better than any DVD version out there, but don't expect eye-popping detail. Most of the time the matches, especially from the 80s and 90s, simply appear less pixelated; the images are still quite soft and look their age.. just cleaner. The match selection is good enough that, when combined with specific superstar or themed match collections, should allow the fan to avoid buying any of the pricey WrestleMania (or other PPV) anthology sets.

If the WWE wants to do older WrestleManias right, they would release more editions like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrestlemania-III-Championship-Edition/dp/B000MLWQ7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrestlemania III (Championship Edition)</a>, complete with commentary from the wrestlers who headlined the 'Mania or provided the most memorable moments, and background material/video packages so the context of the otherwise obscure matches (to most fans) can be understood.

There are some nice elements, such as the behind-the-scenes look at WrestleMania IX, and I did enjoy hearing from the various superstars and crew members. But these moments are mostly scattered and brief. How this documentary can not have *any* comments/thoughts from four of WrestleMania's greatest superstars--The Undertaker, Bret Hart, Randy Savage, Roddy Piper--is egregious for a story wanting to create any form of value. In short, by itself, this is WrestleMania History 101 (or a supplemental set to the WM2000 documentary at best). Die-hard fans will need to seek out more sources for a truly in-depth experience.",1301702400,,3590,5.922779922779923
4371705,5,B004FZWDRE,"Don't listen to the HATERS!  This DVD is terrific, and its even better on Blu Ray.  The documentary was awesome... and was definitely produced for not only WWE fans, but also non-WWE fans.  So glad it was kept to a very managable and entertaining 2 hours.  Any doc over 2 hours starts wearing me out, so I thought this was the perfect length.  Overall, just great insight into a great event!",1301270400,,391,4.450704225352113
4371706,3,B004FZWDRE,"Like alot of others are saying, there is just not much ""inside"" scoop on WM, which would have been great.  Hearing commentary from various wrestlers and talents was the most interesting part of this, with one exception: Matt Striker.  I hate to call the dude out because he is a talented guy, but you hear everyone's candid comments, then you hear Matt Striker either reading or reciting memorized comments prepared by WWE.  Watch the DVD and you'll know what I mean.  It is brutal.  DVD is ok, though.  Worth a watch.",1301184000,,518,4.637362637362638
4371707,1,B004FZWDRE,This DVD COULD HAVE been a great in depth look into the secret behind the scenes life of Wrestlemania. But it eneded up being one huge Vince Mcmahon self glorifying DVD. I asked myself one question after I watched this DVD. What do I know now that I didn't know before I watched the DVD...and the answer sadly is nothing.,1301184000,2,321,4.366666666666666
4371708,5,B004FZWDRE,"Just like how football has ""The Super Bowl"" & baseball as ""The World Series"", the world of wrestling has ""WrestleMania"" as the biggest annual event.  Now after decades of this event, WWE has finally put out a documentary that showcases so many elements of this event via stories of happenings in-front of & behind the camera along with video footage including some that has never been seen before.  You hear from various people throughout this documentary from past & current WWE talent (Gene Okerland, Vince McMahon, Hulk Hogan, Howard Finkel, Jerry Lawler, Gerald Brisco, The Rock, Chris Jericho, John Cena, Big Show, Triple H, Rey Mysterio, Ricky Steamboat, Pat Patterson, Ted Dibiase Sr., Edge, Sgt. Slaughter, Steve Austin, Jesse Ventura, Sheamus, Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton, Jack Swagger), celebrities (William Perry, Donald Trump, Floyd Mayweather, Snoop Dogg, Bob Ucker, Mike Tyson, Pete Rose, ect.), and those behind the scenes of the events that we rarely or never hear from (Publisher Of Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine Stu Stacks, President Of NBC Sports Dick Ebersol, WWE Director Kerwin Silfies, Head Of WWE Business Strategy Basil DrVito, ect.).

The documentary begins with the talk of the territory system that wrestling was under before Vince McMahon decided to take the WWE national while connecting with the MTV Generation & celebrities like Cindy Lauper & Mr. T in the process.  The process of how WrestleMania came about such as who actually came up with the name, getting the celebrities such as Muhammed Ali to Billy Martin to Liberace involved, how to get this event broadcast around the nation, how this would ""make or break"" the WWE was discussed next with Hulk Hogan even talking about how he was scared that all the talent on the show would be blackballed from the other promotions if it failed.  How the success of this event led to the idea of doing WrestleMania 2 from 3 different locations was talked about next with the difference being that the celebrities came to WWE this time instead of WWE had to go to them before with the highlight being Vince going into how he always had ""lady luck"" on his side as it's difficult to do that with the technology today so imagine doing that 25 years ago to the point where WrestleMania was shown in full for free on television for the first & only time in one market.  WrestleMania III in Detroit was about WWE achieving ""Super Bowl"" status as Vince wanted to break an attendance record was talked about next before going into details of how they adjusted their normal setting to make the live experience benefit everyone from the top to bottom row of fans (with showing exclusive footage of the setup & rehearsal), how the use of celebrities was different from the previous years, and talking about the two most memorable matches on the card as one that drew the house (Hogan/Andre) and one stole the show (Steamboat/Savage).  The documentary then jumped ahead to the return of WrestleMania to Detroit at WrestleMania 23 & the ""Battle Of The Billionaires"" match with Vince & Donald Trump that made it the highest grossing Mania of all time before going into the long relationship between Vince/WWE & Trump that brought both WrestleMania IV & V to the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City with these WrestleMania's setting the stage for how Mania would be presented in the future as they were the first ones to be exclusively on pay-per-view & the first to have a weekend of events to draw the in the community which we see today with events like Fan Axxess.  WrestleMania VI in Canada being the first international WrestleMania was highlighted by the ""Ultimate Challenge"" between Hogan & Warrior with Edge giving his memories on the event before talking about their return to the SkyDome in Toronto with both Triple H & Jericho talking about they didn't want to follow Hogan/Rock as Jericho put it perfectly, ""we went on last but THEY were the main event.""  The importance of Hulk Hogan to the event itself was discussed along with the controversial angle between him & Sgt. Slaughter at WrestleMania VII that WWE claims to have caused the event to be moved at the last minute before talking about why the dream match between Flair/Hogan didn't happen at WrestleMania VIII.  One of the highlights of the documentary came here as they discussed the idea behind the ""Roman Coliseum"" at WrestleMania IX with a heavy amount of never before seen footage of how they put the event together from the wrestlers backstage to rehearing entrances to setting up the arena before going into how, despite the reception of the two WWE Title changes that night, anything is possible at WrestleMania.  The idea behind bringing the WrestleMania back to Madison Square Garden to celebrate every 10th anniversary (with footage from WMX & XX) is talked about before going into the evolution of adding additional events to WrestleMania such as Fan Axxess & the Hall Of Fame.  WWE's ""New Generation"" era of WrestleMania is discussed next with highlights & discussions of each main event (Lawerence Taylor/Bam Bam Bigelow at XI, Bret/Shawn in an Ironman Match at XII) before going into how the submission match with Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 would launch Steve Austin to the point where he ""saved"" WrestleMania for the next few years.  Mike Tyson's participation in WrestleMania XIV was talked about next before going to how other celebrities give the event more pop culture credibility with comments from various celebrities who have participated at Mania including Pete Rose talking about his trilogy of appearances with Kane.  The impact of matches from WrestleMania XV (Austin/Rock) & XVI/2000 (tag team ladder match) were talked about next before going into how WrestleMania XVII was a ""seismic shift"" as both ECW & WCW were out of business leaving WWE a monopoly in the wrestling business.  WrestleMania XIX was highlighted by the retirement of Steve Austin to the point where he explained what initials were on his ring vest that we've never seen & the return of Shawn Michaels before going into why Shawn has earned the name ""Mr. WrestleMania.""  With WrestleMania's XX through 22 being held in arenas before Vince wanted to take it back into stadiums was a heavy discussed topic with the talents giving observations/different opinions about the pros & cons of wrestling in an arena versus a stadium.  After going into the concept of ""Going Hollywood"" for WrestleMania 21 & the introduction of the traditional Money In The Bank match, the documentary goes into various superstars talking about their moments such as walking in as champion or winning the first championship or something more personal (Randy Orton making his Mania debut 20 years after his dad participated in the first Mania in the same building of Madison Square Garden), the opinions of how Cena is as important to the event today as Austin & Hogan were in the past, and the music involved with WrestleMania was talked about next with the heavy importance of ""America The Beautiful"" being discussed (along with highlights of past performances of it) before hearing from the past bands who have performed at the event (Motorhead, P.O.D., Saliva, Drowning Pool, Limp Bizkit).  WrestleMania XXIV was talked about next with the original plans for it to be held in an arena & moved to the Citrus Bowl were discussed & went into details about how people had a negative opinion of it to the point where WWE gave the that stadium a complete makeover for it to be ""WrestleMania quality"" before going into the setup of the Big Show vs. Floyd Mayweather match.  The 25th Anniversary Of WrestleMania was highlighted by the match between Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker with many discussing about the importance of it to the point where those in the WWE/World Title matches talking about how they weren't able to follow that encounter.  The importance of Undertaker's streak is talked about next with talent talking about how Mania is ""his show"" and Edge stating his opinion that his matches with the streak on the line ""are more important than the title matches"" before the documentary ends on what many feel legacy of WrestleMania is.

Matches Include:
Hulk Hogan & Mr. T vs. Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff - The night & match that put sports entertainment on the map. Everyone does a great job making Mr. T look better than he actually was and just knew how to mix brawling & wrestling to make a good match to watch with even special ringside enforcer Muhammed Ali getting involved in the action at one point.
WrestleMania
[Hulk Hogan: Ultimate Anthology; Roddy Piper: Born To Controversy]

WWE Intercontinental Champion Randy Savage vs. Ricky Steamboat - Let's be honest here, I can try to summarize this match but words wouldn't do it justice & what hasn't been said about this match that hasn't been said for over 20 years. This was the match that stole the show at WrestleMania III, this was the match that was an inspiration to so many wrestlers today like Chris Jericho, and is still known as one of the greatest matches of all time.
WrestleMania III
[Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection; Ricky Steamboat: Life Of A Dragon; History Of Intercontinental Championship]

WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant - The biggest match in the history of professional wrestling as it headlined the 93,000+ indoor attendance record. It was Hogan going against the man that nobody (including himself) was able to beat for around 15 years as it wasn't as great of a ""wrestling match"" as the earlier Steamboat/Savage match was but it was definitely THE ATTRACTION as there's nothing I can say about this match that hasn't been said for decades now.
WrestleMania III
[Hulk Still Rules; Hulk Hogan: Ultimate Anthology; History Of WWE Championship]

Retirement Match: Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy Savage - Without a doubt, Ultimate Warrior's greatest opposition was always Randy Savage & this match is the perfect example as he gave Warrior one of the greatest matches (if not THE greatest match) in his career. This was back in the day when wrestling was still ""kayfabe"" so you were on the edge of your seat for over 20 mins. not knowing who was going to leave since you really couldn't see either guy away from WWE at that time. The match itself is one of the top quality matches on this set & in both men's careers but the most memorable moment here is what happened afterwords that led to my personal favorite WrestleMania moment of all time to this day & one of the most emotional moments in wrestling history to the point where people forgot about the match that only happened minutes earlier and you saw the fans in the arena crying tears of joy.
WrestleMania VII
[Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection; Self Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior]

Ladder Match: WWE Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels - This was one of the first WrestleMania matches that had this long of a buildup dating back to over six months earlier with the debate of who was the ""real"" Intercontinental Champion.  This is another match that quite frankly I can't say anything that hasn't already been said about it. This was the beginning of the ""showstopper"" as this not only stole the show at WrestleMania X but also set the standards for the future Ladder/T.L.C. matches with the various spots, falls, and moments...including Shawn ""making an ass"" out himself at one moment to the approval of many women in the building.  While Razor Ramon put on one hell of a performance, Jerry Lawler described Shawn Michaels in this match perfectly at one point, ""HE IS SUPERMAN!""
WrestleMania X
[History Of Intercontinental Championship; Shawn Michaels: From The Vault]

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Steve Austin - ""The Austin Era Has Begun"" here as this was the match where the torch was passed from Austin & what many conciser to be the launching point of the Attitude Era.  The story behind this match was that Mike Tyson was the special enforcer for this match but revealed himself to be a member of Shawn's group of D-Generation X while other DX members Triple H & Chyna were also at ringside to stack the deck against Austin...however the bigger story here was that this was set to be Shawn Michaels last match as he came into this match with a heavily injured back & continued to put on a ""Mr. WrestleMania"" worthy performance despite being in constant pain that he clearly couldn't hid at times.  This was a landmark performance in both men's career.
WrestleMania XIV
[History Of The WWE Championship]

Ladder Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. vs. Edge & Christian - Although these three teams are more famous with being the innovators of the T.L.C. match, this was actually the precursor to that match in this being the first triple threat ladder match. This match topped the previous ladder match between the Hardys/Edge & Christian months earlier at No Mercy & was a non-stop highlight reel with tables getting involved along with so many memorable moments like Jeff Hardy's swanton off the biggest ladder in the match & Matt Hardy going through a table that look like it exploded on impact.
WrestleMania 2000
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence; Jeff Hardy: My Rules, My Way; Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

Street Fight: Shane McMahon vs. Vince McMahon - Mick Foley was the special guest referee for this match & before the match gets started, the foreshadowing of events to come took place as Shane McMahon introduced some of the WCW stars to the arena to complete silence & it should also be noted that Stephanie McMahon was in Vince's corner for this match. This fight started off with a bang as Vince took the fight to Shane while beating him with weapons such as metal signs, a monitor & choking him with the cable cords. This evolved into one of the wildest matches you've ever seen just by how many twist & turns kept happening from the appearance of Trish Stratus & the fight with Stephanie, the involvement of Linda McMahon & Mick Foley along with Shane's finishing move that was never seen before in WWE (but seen before in a more ""extreme"" environment). This was a street fight that had no right to be as good as it was.
WrestleMania X-Seven
[McMahon]

The Rock vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - I know I've said this a lot in my reviews on here but it's true, this is a match that words wouldn't do justice on so many levels.  In my opinion, this was the last classic match that Hulk Hogan had in his career.  Hogan brought his A game here that we hadn't seen dating back to possibly the early days of WCW while the crowd so so heavily into it that Jim Ross called it perfectly when he said ""this is a WrestleMania moment"" when Rock & Rock didn't even touch each other yet the crowd was going wild.  The audience reacted to every move they made & even picked the side that wasn't planned before going into this match but everything resulted in a positive in the end as The Rock got that important WrestleMania win that kept alluding his throughout his career while Hogan regained his fans.  I tried but as I said earlier, words don't do this match justice.
WrestleMania X-8
[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology]

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar - At a WrestleMania that had so many attractions such as Shawn Michaels return to WrestleMania, the 20 year grudge match between Hulk Hogan & Vince McMahon, and the third match of between The Rock & Steve Austin...these two closed out the show.  In the day & age of ""sports entertainment"", this was a ""professional wrestling"" fans dream match as this played off amateur wrestling backgrounds heavily in a very technical match.  This was very similar to the Austin/Michaels match in that Kurt Angle came into this match & performed to the best of his abilities with an injured neck while Brock Lesnar wouldn't walk out this match safe as he attempted a move that went wrong to the point where Brock suffered a concussion which he was lucky to get as it could have been worse & possibly broken his neck.
WrestleMania XIX
[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain]

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Triple H - This match was similar to how the Hogan/Rock match at WrestleMania X8 was in that WWE had this match setup for one guy to be the babyface & the other the heel but the fans decided otherwise.  It was during this period that John Cena was receiving a heavy amount of backlash by the fans as WWE Champion despite how much WWE was trying to force the audience to cheer for him (his previous Kurt Angle feud is a perfect example of that) which resulted in Triple H (who's no stranger to the audience disliking him for being shoved down their throats) being the lesser of two evils to the audience & came into this match as the fan favorite.  As eluded to in the weeks building up to this event, Triple H took Cena very lightly & kept showing him up throughout the match...which would eventually come back to bite him as not only did the match end with the result that some people didn't expect but how it ended was in a way that even more people didn't expect.  As a side note, pay attention to the ring entrances during this match as both of them came off as ""did they really think that would get over"" moments while if you pay close attention during Cena's entrance...you'll see a ""Straight Edge"" Chicago mobster.
WrestleMania 22

(Blu-Ray) Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. C.M. Punk vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Carlito vs. M.V.P. vs. Mr. Kennedy....Kennedy (sorry, I'm a mark for that) - Anyways, you know that this match is set to be nothing more than a non-stop spotfest and boy was it ever. Morrison's moonsault off the top rope with ladder in hand & later taking a fall that every man watching felt, Shelton Benjamin's ""tower of doom"" powerbomb off the ladder & his fall out of the ring onto the ladder wedged on the outside, the Walls Of Jericho on the ladder, Carlito's ""backstabber"" off the ladder, and the return of Matt Hardy. One of the best Money In The Bank's matches yet.
WrestleMania XXIV

(Blu-Ray) Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels - This is one of those matches that I can try to describe & review but the words wouldn't do it justice. This match had everything (including the unique ""Heaven & Hell"" entrances) on a physical & emotional level of both men refusing to lose to the point where this was the closest anyone had ever come to breaking the streak to the point where you saw the most emotion from Undertaker since his ""Deadman"" character returned 5 years ago & Shawn was even so desperate at one point, he was hoping for a win via count out. Instant classic here & quite frankly, this was the match that saved this show & should have ended it since nobody was going to be able to top it.
WrestleMania XXV
[Shawn Michaels: My Journey]

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion Batista vs. John Cena - For their SummerSlam match being remembered as shocking for how good it was just knowing how limited both guys are, they proved here that the quality of that match wasn't a fluke. Batista heavily focused on Cena's neck that he injured in that SummerSlam match including one moment delivering such a stiff DDT that Cena needed a few moments to recover. Both men delivered their various trademark moves in more impactful & unique ways that we're used to seeing such as Cena's Attitude Adjustment where he released Batista & tossed him instead of just slamming him down. This had plenty of counters, kickouts, moments revisited from their previous SummerSlam match, and was even able to do some grounded holds that kept people on their feet. Cena & Batista just work well off each other & This was a match that definitely lived up to the hype & Cena's best WrestleMania match. Just like the other Edge/Jericho match, keep watching afterwords as Cena addressed the crowd wearing the infamous ""We Hate Cena"" shirts the only way John Cena knows how.
WrestleMania XXVI
[The John Cena Experience]

In the end, the documentary was one of the best ones WWE has done for a while as they gave it plenty of time (around 2 hours) with the exclusive footage & additional comments from those behind the scenes of WWE that never hear from was a very welcomed addition.  The matches themselves were good selections although I would flip some of the Blu-Ray exclusives with the regular matches as they were better quality.  In the end though, the documentary alone sells this DVD set so I would definitely get it with no questions asked.",1301097600,7,20518,4.764291748803154
4371709,1,B004FZWDRE,"As one other reviewer pointed out, a documentary on Wrestlemania cannot be released without some people wondering if everything in there is true. Although I'm not going to go as far as one reviewer that claimed that there were only 78,00 people at WMIII, the backstory to WMVII being moved in venue is true. Would I buy this DVD? Most likely not for several reasons.

First of all, anything released from the WWE can always be accused of being biased in some way, shape, or form. Attempts to implicitly snubb former wrestlers that either left under questionable circumstances, or work for other competitions, is always going to be present. The WWE Top 50 Wrestlers of All Time DVD is a prime example and where certain wrestlers, notably Hulk Hogan & Ric Flair, obviously came as a result of their involvement in TNA.

Secondly, the match selection was to be expected. You CAN'T have a Wrestlemania DVD without the Hogan/Andre WMIII encounter. The same is true for Savage/Steamboat from the same Wrestlemania, HBK/Razor Ramon Ladder Match from WMX, Hogan/Rock from WMX8, and the Triangle Ladder Match from WM2000. I will admit that one surprise was including Lesnar/Angle from WMXIX, which was a great match. Outside of that, I thought the match selection was weak and included too many matches already highlighted so many times, I can recite them blindfolded. A couple matches I felt didn't deserve to be in the set. Looking at the list, the two that came to mind immediately was the McMahon/McMahon match from WM17 (I think the Undertaker/Triple H match might have been a better choice), and the Austin/HBK match from WM14 (Austin/Hart from WM13 was a MUCH BETTER match)

Anytime WWE does a DVD like this, there is risk that it could go either way. It could be a great set, or it could be disastrous. I personally thought the WWE DVD in greatest Tag Teems would have been great, but when I heard the host selection, and then looked at the match selection, I was immediately turned away from it. Other DVD's, like the one on Chris Jericho and Edge, turned out to be better than expected. I saw there is an upcoming DVD on the Best Cage Natches. I hope this will be a good one, since I love steel cage matches. However, who knows. Most WWE DVD's are a mixed bag.",1301011200,,2261,4.675879396984925
4371710,5,B004FZWDRE,"When I think of how bad this one could have been, I have to give the WWE credit for the organization of the documentary. It follows eras of Wrestlemania, rather than going through each and giving a little promo on each one. They basically broke them down into the Hogan era, the post Hogan era, the Austin Era, and the Cena era.

The documentary is packed with 2 hours of great material. Vince McMahon cried in this thing. I thought I would never see that in my life!! They do a good job at describing how Vince put everything on the line for this one event. To sell people into going to a theatre to watch a wrestling match in 1985 was quite a feat. I would have never made that decision, but somehow Vince was able to convince a ton of celebrities and hundreds of thousands of people to believe in this concept and here we are so many events later and it is probably the best event of the year for wrestling fans.

You can look to others for recaps of the matches. I always consider them bonuses as I only buy these special DVDs for the documentaries. I thought they did a nice job to add Hogan-Andre from Wrestlemania III. I think we have all seen it a ton of times, but I never get tired of it. An odd addition was including the fantastic match of the UFC's Brock Lesnar going for the title against TNA's Kurt Angle. Such a great match.

I have seen this documentary a handful of times already. It's one you will want to watch again and again. It has a lot of information from the people who were there at the time. I find something I missed everytime I see it.

While anyone could whine over this or that being left off or glossed over, I have to give a high recommendation for this one. The WWE pulled back the curtain and let us look at some of the inner workings that they have not allowed in the past.",1300752000,2,1810,4.192528735632184
4371711,2,B004FZWDRE,"This may be the strangest entry yet in the WWE's DVD pantheon. Does anyone out there expect the ""truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth"" from the WWE, a company that's been, eh, a little less than forthright over the years, particularly about their showcase, Wrestlemania?

  If Vince McMahon, owner of the company, actually does come forward and fess up to many 'Mania myths, such as the 93,000 people they claim were present for WM III, the most famous of the 26 shows (actual number:78,000); or their sleazy claim that WM VII was moved from the Coliseum in L.A. to the Sports Arena because of 'terrorist fears' (this was in early '91 during the Persian Gulf conflict part 1, and the reason it was moved was due solely to slow ticket sales)...then i'll happily apologize in print for ever doubting the George Washington of pro wrestling himself, Mr Mcmahon. Or is he the Richard Nixon? Remember, both Presidents are famous for 'not lying'.",1300579200,5,948,4.7682926829268295
4371712,4,B004FZWDRE,"For a period of time WWE was known for its amazing Documentaries that include usually over an hour long documentary followed by 2 more discs of matches highlighting and backing up the documentary on which it was about. In recent years WWE has been very very lazy with its documentaries often rehashing interviews and having run times of less than an hour. I have not been a Wrestling fan for quiet some time but I was once again inserted into this grand sport after the HUGE inclusion of the Rock finally returning to the WWE to host its 27th WrestleMania event. With my excitement peaked again I decided to check out this DVD and I must say I was quiet impressed.

  Firstly over 80% of the documentary was brand new footage as well as never before seen footage (I.E The build up backstage to WrestleMania 9). This documentary talked about the greatest achievements of WrestleMania while at the same time managing to be both informative and entertaining. I had always known Celebrities to play a certain role in WrestleMania but until this DVD I did not have any idea just how much or an important role figures like Tyson, Ali, Mr. T, etc etc all played in getting people interested into WrestleMania and made it the huge success it is. My first Wrestlemania was 22 and the first Big time celebrity I remember watching was Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather and looking back I remember just how HUGE of a deal it was that he was going to be fighting the giant Big Show and it made me remember how many people were talking about that match on TV. I never realized it but WrestleMania probably would not be here today if it was not for the celebrities who have taken part of it.
  Secondly I was more than impressed at the running time of this documentary putting in close to 2 hours worth of footage, it really seemed like WWE tried with this one. My only true problem was how during the WrestleMania 20 conversation Chris Benoit was neglected. I understand the whole subject is still taboo even after all these years but no matter what Chris Benoit was the main event of WrestleMania 20 and nothing can change that.

  The majority of matches where all matches I have seen before but WWE did a pretty good choice selection managing to include some recent hits (HBK VS TAKER, CENA VS HHH) as well as the matches we have seen on 50 other dvds (Hogan/Andre for one).

  This DVD definitely deserves some praise because I can really sense WWE tried hard with this one. You can tell this is not some half as* Documentary that WWE studios threw together in 20 minutes.
This is something any WrestleMania fan should atleast rent.",1300492800,3,2613,4.550106609808102
4371713,3,B004FZWDRE,"This had the potential to be a really insightful glimpse into the deep personal risks Vince McMahon took in launching the first world-scale wrestling show, as well as the dozens of twists, turns and backstage drama that transpired at each subsequent event. Instead, the narration merely grazed the surface of those untold stories before leaning back into an easy, gentle fluff piece. The few peeks we got behind the curtains, like Mean Gene cracking up in an interview with William ""Refrigerator"" Perry and Vince critiquing the art direction during the WMIX build, were my favorite bits. That's the kind of stuff I really wanted to see, not another recap of the wrestlers' favorite main events and some classic lessons in revisionist history. It would've been better served as the story of the first ten (maybe even five) WrestleManias, too, as trying to cram commentary on twenty five different events resulted in a monotonous pace and forced ignorance of several legendary moments in the show's dazzling history.",1300320000,25,1014,5.114457831325301
4371714,4,B004FZWDRE,"First off, I want to start by saying I've been a die-hard WWE fan for over 30 years. From the Hogans and Steamboats, to the Dumpster Droces, and Doinks, to the Austins and Rocks, to Today. I think this documentary was put together well and told a story that needed to be told. Of course WWE is going to put their own spin on it. it's THEIR documentary. With That being said, I read the other reviews saying that its the same interviews, clips and matches. So What? This doc actually covers Wrestlemania. And of course they are going to focus more on the first 4 WMs. The first was historical, the second took a risk with being in 3 cities, the third broke an indoor attendance record(along with having the biggest match in history, as well as the best match in history), and the forth was the first to be back to back in the same venue.(My hometown)
I also enjoyed the backstage footage from WM IX. I own most documentaries, and never saw that before. Also, of course they are going to replay what some people have said in the past. I.E. Hogan. He doesn't work for Vinny any more, and to have a WM documentary without comments from the other man that made it so successful is just foolish.

Could it have been better. Of course! But Vince is only going to allow the curtain to be pulled back so much. There still has to be a little mystery, since the dirt sheets ruined pretty much every surprise in the last 10 years.",1300233600,,1418,4.330827067669173
4371715,5,B004FZWDRE,"There have been complaints about how the documentary of this part skips around, jumping over the years. But that only enhances the fantastic showcase for how Wrestlemania has evolved into a true spectacular. The interviews are terrific, covering a wide range, not just WWE stars but guys you didn't expect like Hogan, Jesse Ventura and even publisher Stu Saks. The opinons are nice and varied from Gene Okerlund believing Wrestlemania VII was a ""so-so"" show (I disagree with that) to talk on whether the Undertaker's streak should be broken. It's backed up by fantastic behind-the-scenes footage, showing how Mania IX worked and more, a truly great look at how the show comes about. The highlights are terrific:

*Discussing how Steamboat/Savage was the true highlight of Mania III.

*John Cena showing pictures of himself as a kid watching that show at home.

*HHH and Chris Jericho both saying they didn't want to have to follow Hogan/Rock at Mania X8 as they knew they couldn't top it.

*The looks at the stadium feel, such as how they spent a fortune making the Citrus Bowl look far better than it truly was for Mania 24.

*Why ""America the Beautiful"" is the theme and the various musical acts.

*Mistakes with too many celebs at Mania 2 and more.

While it can be self-serving (especially on Mania III and VII), you truly get a sense of awe watching this, a reminder of why this is the biggest wrestling event of the year. The stars are heartfelt on how it feels to be part of it and honored to see it continue. The matches may be familiar but show Mania at its best. Overall, a must-have for any wrestling fan as you remember why we love this crazy business so much.",1300147200,,1672,4.647457627118644
4371716,4,B004FZWDRE,This is a great DVD and is among the best WWE has ever done. I have been a wrestling fan since the first Wrestlemania and there is ALOT of unseen footage. I think my favorite thing about the dvd is how serious it is. It is a very serious documentary of Wrestlemania and shows how important the event is to WWE. Buy the DVD. You won't be dissapointed.,1300147200,,350,4.161764705882353
4371717,1,B004FZWDRE,"All you really need is DISC 1 considering you can watch the DISC 2 & 3 matches on Youtube or on the net. I was very disappointed. First of all, most of the interviews were just past clips from various WWE dvds in the past. Shawn Michaels, Austin, Rock, and Hogan stuff was from a documentary for Wrestlemania 19 called ""Mania of Wrestlemania"". They did have some never-before seen stuff from Wrestlemania 9 in Vegas which was ok. Even Vince McMahon's interview was disappointing. He says the same things in every dvd...""had my father known what i was going to do with the business, he wouldn't have sold it to me"".. ""if Wrestlemania didn't work, I wouldn't be sitting here"", etc. I was really hoping for MORE. The beginning with the Rock N Wrestling connection was good..the idea of closed circuit venues, and celebrity stuff. It got boring after 30 min.",1299974400,9,854,4.662251655629139
4371718,2,B004FZWDRE,"2 stars is being VERY generous here. After reviewing the detailed information on the ""documentary"" part and looking over the matches with some advance information i've received, its another  big disappointment. The WWE continues to milk the same stories over and over and over again. There's really nothing new in the documentary and most of these matches have been on other DVD releases 2, 3, 4 times and in some cases, more than that.
The media dept. at the WWE instead should be focusing on putting together some high quality 3-disc sets on previous superstars that they've missed (for example Andre the Giant...my god, there's not even a proper 3-disc set w/documentary on the incredible man and legend...just an old VHS single awful release that has since been transferred to DVD).
Also, the Blu-Ray version of this isn't really a big deal either as most of the file footage is not high-def worthy and will look like standard DVD picture.
I've looked at the details of the documentary to try and find a new angle here, but its mostly re-hashed information that we already know. Another poor release from the WWE in now what is a line of sub-par (at best) discs. Hopefully someone over there in their media dept. wakes up and once again starts putting out worthwhile projects.",1298246400,14,1280,4.818181818181818
