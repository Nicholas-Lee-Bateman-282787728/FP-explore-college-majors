8563683,5,B00B7PWLVS,"Great game . Could not get any better other than to be a game called by Bear.  You have Bill Oliver calling the D that confused Miami so bad that Geno could not do anything.  Great game from a great coach Gene Stallings. To top it all off calling the came for the fans could only of been better if Eli Gold were calling it, but this man was a great friend of Bear's. Keith Jackson's voice is legend in college football and always will be just like Howard  Cosell. You need only hear a second of his voice to know him and know you were in for a treat.",1524182400,,550,3.981818181818182
