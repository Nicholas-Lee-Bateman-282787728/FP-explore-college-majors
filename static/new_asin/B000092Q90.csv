This was supposed to be a serious Sword and Sorcery movie but, lacking the budget to pull that off, they turned it into a fun, cheesy romp through time...and they did it very well! You may catch references to other movies and cartoons. If you're void of a sense of humor and the movie doesn't manage to entertain you, you still get to watch a beautiful 25 year old John Terlesky run around in leather pants and loin cloths...if you are into that! For those of you who prefer beautiful, half naked women, you won't be disappointed either.

 The DVD comes with commentary from Toni Naples, John Terlesky and the director, Jim Wynorski. Heads up...this is the best commentary I've ever heard...watch the movie and then watch with the commentary on.",1459036800,,832,4.54
7988545,3,B000092Q90,"Hokey movie with Huge Hefner's former squeeze, Barbi Benton.  In Deathstalker, she is a spoiled princess who is held by a really awful bad guy who hosts a party for all of the countrysides warriors, who end up killing off each other.  Rick Hll plays Deathstalker, Barbi is Codille, and Munkar is played by Bernard Erhard.

The warrior Deathstalker is sent by a witch on a quest to find a chalice, an amulet, and a sword, two of which are held by the wicked sorcerer Munkar.  Deathstalker finds the sword almost immediately and heads to Munkar's tournament.  Munkar has invited warriors across the land to participate in contests until a winner is determined - the winner will inherit Munkar's kingdom.

The warriors are invited to get drunk and rape Munkar's harem slaves, including Princess Codille (Barbi Benton).  A lot of skin and erotic stuff in the movie, a man's movie for sure.

Deathstalker is the hero, so you know he wins, but how does he do it?  See the movie, a fun B movie.",1416096000,,987,4.626436781609195
