1878073,5,B000093NTX,"The concert`s visuals and sound are spectacular. after 2 ""tentative"" dvds, live in Copenhagen and live at the Union Chapel (both good and very good, respectively), Gary & band reach majestic heights with this concert.
Fresh arrangements bring a new vitality to the songs that I thought Procol had lost with the passage of time, very energetic playing specially in the guitar and drums department(by Geoff and Mark)with the Commander`s voice in fine form for the occasion.
if you like good music superbly played in a fantastic place, then go and buy the DVD, you won`t regret it",1246147200,16,577,4.8979591836734695
1878074,5,B000093NTX,"A perfect performance in a beautiful country by a world class act.
A selection of superb music composed by Gary Brooker which is complimented by eloquent lyrics by Keith Reid that spans 40 years of a professional partnership performed by Procol Harum's virtuoso musicians.  Imagine a symphony orchestra and choir masterly  weaved in and out of the majestic music performance of classic songs, such as  ""Whiter Shade of Pale"", ""Grand Hotel"" and the not so often performed but nevertheless inspiring ""Into the Flood"" and ""Sympathy For The Hard Of Hearing""
I was fortunate to attend the concert and this DVD is an aural and visual treasure.",1245456000,7,637,4.990566037735849
1878075,5,B000093NTX,"Just when you might have thought that Gary Brooker and company had decided to pack it in, here they come again with their most satisfying DVD to date. Procol Harum: In Concert with the Danish National Concert Orchestra & Choir is not just aurally and visually spectacular, it is essential listening and viewing for any Procol Harum fan.
So you look at the playlist and say to yourself that you have heard it all before. Well, no you haven't. That is because there are fresh arrangements to old favorites that will just stun you and the way the band meshes with the orchestra and choir is a joy to hear. Then there is the setting of the grounds of Ledreborg Castle that assures you that you are experiencing something culturally important.
Its tough to select favorites since every song is nearly flawlessly performed, but there are some highlights: the oft-disparaged Something Magic is powerfully transformed here; the new arrangement for Homburg oozes sophistication; The VIP Room comes alive in a way you can't imagine; Fires ( Which Burnt Brightly) fairly outshines the original; Nothing But the Truth stirs the soul and the crowd; A Salty Dog assumes a new majesty; An Old English Dream brings a new appreciation for its lyrical power; and a fresh take on A Whiter Shade of Pale will leave you agape. The biggest surprise is a tour de force performance of the rare Sympathy For the Hard of Hearing which is given additional heft by Brooker's comments on the song before its performance. The encore songs, Whaling Stories and Conquistador wind up the show in grand fashion.
That is not all. Those who buy this DVD are treated to an intimate live performance of six mid-period songs filmed for Danish TV in 1974. Each song is a gem and the players at that time include the legendary B J Wilson on drums. You could not ask for better value.
On this DVD, Brooker and company prove that Procol Harum is a band for the ages. Working closely with the Danish orchestra and choir, many of whose members have never before played rock music, you'll hear that the band has achieved the level of musical maturity they always seemed destined for. And it brings the Danes a measure of international exposure and respect they might not otherwise have found. The DVD package includes an attractive booklet containing interesting commentary and lots of excellent photography. Get it soon, you'll be watching often.",1243987200,34,2401,4.787951807228915

What can be said to enhance the legendary music of Procol Harum? My salute and praises can be read on my review of the Union Chapel DVD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Procol-Harum-Live-at-the-Union-Chapel/dp/B00025ETD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Procol Harum - Live at the Union Chapel</a>
What brings to mind is this music can never define a period of history or culture for Procol is eternally transcendent and the scope of work is always fresh and speaks to the current times. If only those who have never ventured within the vastness of greatness will but sip the wine, alas to be drunk for ever.
Again, a quality offering from Brooker and company amongst cellos, violins and string sections in 2006 as once ventured in 1972 with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Procol-Harum-Live-In-Concert-with-the-Edmonton-Symphony-Orchestra/dp/B00006ALRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Procol Harum Live: In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra</a>

The current lineup of PH is far -  FAR too available, as PH has become but a franchise for Gary Brooker and (almost) any four other musicians.  So - if you want to even be able to ""pretend"" you're viewing the sixties version of PH ""perform"" - well, here's your onliest chance.  But, damn, the rest of the DVD seems to be almost nothing but meglomaniac Leon Russell pimping off his own stuff and - I'm serious now - he's on this thing with ""New Grass Revival"" - and they're performing >giggle< ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" - and Edgar Winter on ""Free Ride,"" too. Oh yeah, and there's Rolling Stone Bill Wyman and the late great Ian Stewart backing Alexis Korner, who, truth be told, is (well...WAS, he's taken a dirt bath by now...) making a transcontinentinal fool of himself, trying to play bottleneck slide.

1878078,2,B000093NTX,"3 German tv ""live"" performances from '68-'69 totalling 14 minutes.  The first song, ""Homburg"" is summarily ended before the last note.  The next two (""Quite Rightly So"" and ""A Salty Dog""), taken together, are of historical significance.  The fourth song, ""In The Wee Small Hours of Sixpence"" is excerpted from the DVD ""Procul Harum Live"" (1971), another German tv production.

Otherwise, the dvd is a ""jukebox"" commercial for classicpictures.co.uk.  And do you really want to watch a jukebox anthology of ""live"" performances with self-promoting advertizements pasted across the video? This Procul Harum is for completeists who cannot get these early videos from another source and want to buy a mere 14 minutes of vintage footage Of course, in that case, then by all means.",1135468800,4,773,5.201612903225806

HE IS ALSO PLAYING A GIBSON SG & LES PAUL GUITAR INSTEAD OF HIS TRADEMARK STRAT. THE PROCOL SONGS ARE GREAT AS WELL. THIS DVD ALSO HAS CLIPS OF OTHER BANDS TOO, LIKE THE LEON RUSSELL ""DELTA LADY"" & STEVE MARRIOTT ARE PRETTY COOL TOO. TO ME, THIS DVD IS WORTH THE PRICE.

Enjoy!..",1402185600,,466,5.486111111111111
1878119,5,B000093NTX,I did not pay close enough attention and got the DVD not the CD version. I really do not care to watch the musicians but as  real fan of this group the orchestration is fabulous. I wish I could have been there. Songs such as Simple Sister and Whiter Shade of Pale have a new dimension with the addition of the orchestra and choir.,1396483200,,330,4.15625
1878120,5,B000093NTX,"I've always been a Procol Harum fan from their first album, which I wore out several times and was one of the first CD's I bought. I liked their ""Live with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra"" but always was disappointed it didn't have A Whiter Shade of Pale on it. Whiter shade has always been one of my all time favorite songs. Now, to the DVD, it is amazing. Well produced, great song selection, next best thing to having been there, maybe even better because you can hear and see the concert any time at your leisure, another kool thing is the bonus of them performing in a small bar in the sixties/seventies. If you are a fan this is a must for your collection.",1387324800,3,662,4.346774193548387
1878131,5,B000093NTX,Great performance of great songs by a great band in a fantastic setting...DVD is good quality too. What more can one say?,1377734400,,121,4.545454545454546
1878132,5,B000093NTX,A great job by both Procol Harem as well as the danish symphony and choir! Gary Brooker's voice is as good or better than ever.,1372896000,,127,4.12
1878133,4,B000093NTX,"I bought this dvd because I heard and saw its version of ""Whiter Shade Of Pale"" on the internet.  It was quite simply the best version of any song I've ever heard on line.  The choir, orchestra and band mesh perfectly for exalting musical experience.  I didn't even care what the words meant, but just reveled in the lyrical imagery and the sonic sweep of the music and the locations majestic space.  Listened to the entire dvd once, and not being familiar with Procol Harum's music, found it differently interesting and am guessing I will be loving it in a short time.",1364256000,,569,4.549019607843137
1878134,5,B000093NTX,"Many of this band's live performances are captured on video in Northern Europe, and this is one of them.  I like this video in particular because the original keyboardist Mathew Fisher is lending an incredible flare to the sublime performance of the band of this generation, though I think every one of their live performance videos are great simply because the Procol Harum's music is timeless.  Sure I miss BJ Wilson's drumming, Robin Trower's funky riffs, and Grabham's tasty melody lines, but Brooker's vocals and piano-playing really make the band's music what they are all about, not to mention his rich talent in composition and arrangement.  The newer members of the band are also fantastic in not just recreating the sound of band from the 60s and 70s, but in making the music seamlessly integrated into the contemporary sounds scape with an orchestra behind them.  The Procol Harum is one of the few bands who can play their music in such tasty updated context and not as ""oldies"".  They also choose some interesting tunes from their huge repertoire, and I really like the selction on this video.",1361923200,,1106,4.893048128342246

1878136,5,B000093NTX,"I'm not even a fan of Procol Harum, but I bought this for my friend that is and have watched it with her. She LOVES it and I must admit that I do too. They are definitely better with an orchestra and with some age to them. Simply a beautiful setting for a really good concert. Highly recommend.",1355702400,,294,4.086206896551724
1878137,5,B000093NTX,After seeing a clip of this show on Youtube I knew I had to get the DVD. I am so glad I did! This beautiful setting is the perfect place to hear this music. Gary Brooker is in great voice and the choir and orchestra add just the right touch to this wonderful music. If you are a Procol Harum fan then you will enjoy this trip down memory lane.,1352505600,,343,3.914285714285714
1878138,5,B000093NTX,this dvd was something that I didn't know existed until I had been going through material for my band to look at. Its a wonderful video and Procol Harum performs flawlessly with the orchestra.,1351555200,,192,4.676470588235294
1878139,5,B000093NTX,"I've been a huge fan of Procol Harum from the very beginning.  Everything about this DVD is simply excellent.  The videography is superb, well-directed, in focus, a great professional job.  The sound could not be better.  So often in live concert performances, the sound is marginal, either messed up by the sound guys doing the actual recording, or screwed up in post-production.  But the sound here is the best I have ever heard from a live recording.  Notice that each singer in the large choral group has his or her own cordless microphone.  Perfect balance!  Listen through your big stereo system!  Procol Harum's music has always lent itself well to symphonic orchestration.  The orchestra and the choral group add tremendous power to the performance, with all orchestral arrangements done by Gary Brooker himself.  The choral group sounds a little stiff on ""Butterfly Boys"", but hey, they're not rockers after all.  But in the end, it's the band itself that shines on brightly.  Procol Harum is one of the greatest rock bands of all time, and, it seems to me, sadly underrated in the US.  Tremendous song-writing over the years, and outstanding musicianship which has only gotten better as the members have aged.  It's the rock-solid grooves by the band's rhythm section and the outstanding soloing that make this whole thing work.  Gary Brooker has always been my favorite male vocalist.  There is something about his voice that is so perfect for this music.  And amazingly, even though he must be in his late 60's, the power of his voice has not diminished one iota.  He still hits those Procol Harum high notes with as much power and authority as he did when he was 25.  Finally, the band performs definitive versions of every one of their hits presented here.  No dicking around, no bogus ""stylizing"", just the perfect rendition of each great song as it was originally intended.  I gotta tell ya, when Brooker hits that high note in the last verse of ""A Salty Dog"", I was so moved I just broke down and sobbed.  Incredibly moving for me.  This is not only one of the best concert videos by Procol Harum, it is one of the greatest concert videos by any band ever.  Simply superlative in every way.",1317686400,5,2207,4.744736842105263
1878140,5,B000093NTX,"I've been following Procol Harum for nearly 40 years and I'm still amazed at the quality of their performances and the endurance of their timeless, passionate material.  Many bands, once no longer staples in the public eye, fade into obscurity and attempt to generate income solely on scrapping the bottom of their archival music catalogs for material to release for sale.  Most of it is total rubbish and clearly a valid reason to remain 'unreleased'.

However, on the re-issued, remastered CD catalog, Procol Harum have done a superior job rounding up the very best and historical material 'from the vaults' and giving their true fans a real value for their hard earned money.  P.H. still create and perform music held to their own highest standards, decade after decade.

In today's economy, we all have to cut corners and it becomes very difficult to justify making a purchases of non-essentials.  As (many of us) glide into our mid-to-late 50's, we cannot afford to gamble on a purchase that may be questionable and somewhat less than rewarding.  With many Procol videos to choose from, and 'others' watching our every spending move, we choose to avoid the investment rather than make a difficult or unpopular decision.

Dear Procol fans, this DVD performance may not contain every favorite you'd like to see included; it does not for me as well.  However, the performances are top notch!  Gary's vocals, the band's performance, and the orchestra & choir are all superb, 5 Star performances!  If you close your eyes you'd think you were back at the now famous Edmonton concert.  This performance of ""Conquistador"" is flawless, and my all time favorite ""A Salty Dog"" is remarkable.

Okay, so you've held off on any (what some of us might call) luxury purchases.  All your spare cash goes to the kids, then perhaps the spouse, but you remain with a wish list a mile long and the remote in your hand.  It's not like you're harvesting from little Johnny's college fund; just give yourself this small 'pat on the back' for all the things you do that no one notices.

Remember what it was like to order something and be so excited you'd check the mailbox every day anticipating its arrival?  That youthful fun can be yours again, with a very mature and rewarding surprise at the other end.

Buy this DVD today!  You deserve it!",1316131200,6,2326,4.798994974874372
1878141,5,B000093NTX,"This is a great live show with a orchestra, something this band did way back in the early 70's too. This time they have a great choir along for the ride. The show is excellent and the arrangements are very strong.  You get versions of the hits of course and even a great 1974 tv special featuring songs mainly from that era of the band's history. It's in color thankfully too. And it's good that it even exists as much of the stuff from that era got erased. This footage looks perfect even and you can step back into the fantastic music scene of the 70's with those songs , including the terrible hairstyles people had back then, but at least their clothes weren't baggy.
The rest is the concert filmed during the day and I agree with the three star reviewer; that it should have been filmed at night, but to rate this a three star because of that is beyond me.  This is progressive rock at it's finest with a fine orchestra and choir to boot.",1315699200,,943,4.292134831460674
1878142,5,B000093NTX,"The record arrived yesterday. I should have been at work not later than at 11:00 for a meeting with my Ph. D. student. I wasn't. I only wanted to have quick look at Gary Brooker after the breakfast and then run to school. But I could not stop watching. The concert is pure magic both musically and technically. Do not take my word for it. Turn on your system, put the record on and play the first piece, the Grand Hotel, and you will see what I mean. In this concert everything else is also great: Gary at his best, charming and immortal, the conductor with his top-notch musicians (do notice the outstanding violinist in Grand Hotel!)  and the unbelievable quality of sound recording that equals the studio one. All of these left me speechless.  I called the student with apologies for being late and I told her the reason. She said she understood. I doubt it. But I don't care.",1290902400,3,879,4.453416149068323

1878144,5,B000093NTX,"This is another great example of the unique ability of Procol Harum to successfully merge rock music with classical.  This great concert is well captured in the DVD, the orchestra sounds superb and the new arrangements by Brooker just prove again that the man's a genius, I only wish I would have been there, but this is the next best thing.  On the negative- no Matthew Fisher, or BJ Wilson(RIP) but their substitutes are quite good and Whitehorn rips almost exactly like Trower.  The 1974 TV Special bonus is fun to watch although the sound as expected is not too good.  All in all, a must have for any self-respecting Procol fan.",1278633600,3,632,4.616071428571429
1878145,5,B000093NTX,"I recently purchased 2 Procol Harum DVDs. I believe I may have purchased the best two available. If you are familiar with this band, you will know they made great music with and without orchestras. This is Procol + orchestra at their best. Gary still sounds great! The sound quality is exceptional!",1269302400,,298,4.75
1878146,5,B000093NTX,"At the beginning of the concert the band is introduced as ""The immortal Procol Harum."" Yes they are. The performance is phenomenal. Having seen Procol Hareum countless times since the early seventies I have never heard Gary Brooker's voice in better form. The only thing lacking is the absence of the late great B.J. Wilson on drums. This video was worth every cent I spent to own it and I will watch it until it wears out or I do.",1264809600,4,431,4.4
1878147,3,B000093NTX,"But the main reason to see this band with an orchestra is Conquistador. Brooker still sings well enough, but instead of the perfect solo played by Dave Ball in the original live recording we get a guy who does a little tapping and calls it a solo. Other than that major failing, we do get choral and orchestral arrangements which often add some nice new touches to familiar old songs.",1260057600,,384,4.5
1878148,5,B000093NTX,"I have many DVDs of rock bands performing with orchestras and/or choirs. None of them come anywhere close to the quality of the sound found here. There are clear reasons for this described in the wonderful booklet that accompanies the DVD. Most orchestras are recorded by a grid of overhead microphones that do not serve to separate the various instruments. Choirs are usually recorded in similar fashion. But NOT here. Each member of the symphony was close miked with their own individual microphone and fed into the board on their own channel, so that when the band's bassist asked the sound man for more oboe in his ear piece, the sound man asked back, ""Which oboeist?"" Each member of the choir had their own high quality hand mike, affording a similar advantage. The sound is simply fantastic from the orchestra and choir.

Also fantastic is the sound from the band although the mix puts the Commander's vocals and piano, the drummer and the guitarist quite high in the mix compared to the organ and bass, but Gary Brooker plays and sings so brilliantly that you want him high in the mix.

If you need a single example of how this all comes together just give a listen to A Salty Dog. This is probably my favorite Procol song. Brooker was, I believe, 62 years old when this was recorded and one could excuse him on that basis if his voice wasn't what it used to be, but it remains absolutely fantastic.

The part of this song after the line ""Our tears were tears of joy"" is possibly my favorite moment in any song by any band ever. The arrangement of the orchestra/choir during this section will raise the hairs on your neck and cover your skin with goose pimples. And the Commanders singing is hugely powerful. This one tune is worth the price of the entire DVD, but there are many, many more major highlights, with Grand Hotel coming in a close second.

This DVD is one for the ages. It is a must hear for Procol fans and it would be a great way for those not familiar with their great music to be introduced.",1255651200,14,2015,4.497267759562842
1878149,3,B000093NTX,"An interesting collection of mostly the same songs, many played quite differently with a full orchestra and choir. The sound, while good, does not have the richness and deep bass (especially in DTS) of ""Live at the Union Chapel"". But it is the video that is almost unwatchable. Instead of concentrating on the Procols, the video keeps cutting every second and a half to a different aspect of the orchestra, to Gary, to the orchestra, to the choir, to the conductor, to Gary, to everyone except Matt Pegg. Speaking of Pegg, where's his bass? I can't hear it. If there is only one DVD to buy, please get the Union Chapel.",1249344000,10,619,4.585585585585585
