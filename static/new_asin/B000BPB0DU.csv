8090515,2,B000BPB0DU,"I was quite dissapointed in the DVD of Luke's Gospel.  I misunderstood the explanition of the product when I ordered it.  I Thought it would be a portrayl of the Gospel by actors, as is the case with Matthew.  If I wanted someone reading it aloud.  I can do that myself.",1366675200,6,270,4.235294117647059
8090516,5,B000BPB0DU,"I used this DVD at my Bible Class, and it's always a joy to hear the Word and see the Word at the same time.  It's artfully done, and the class members commented on their enjoyment of it.  I used the first 3 chapters, the Christmas Story for my last class, and while it is done in a Contemporary Translation, they did not even mention it, they enjoyed hearing the story over again that they have probably heard many years before, but in a new and different way.  I heartily recommend it for anyone involved with Church Classes or for their own personal enjoyment at home.",1355875200,3,571,4.367924528301887
