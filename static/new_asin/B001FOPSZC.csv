8302193,5,B001FOPSZC,My daughter learned to accept people w/ disabilities early b/c her older brother has a developmental disability.  This made her home life perhaps a bit more difficult than most.  This project helped her to accept that a little easier & it definitely helped others w/o that experience to see a person w/ disabilities as one of their own.  It is a positive & sensitive video.,1235433600,2,373,4.707692307692308
8302194,5,B001FOPSZC,"Speak Out For Understanding is an outstanding service-learning project.  Maureen Charron-Shea, a speech-language pathologist, organized this important project to allow students to have a better understanding about the nature of disabilities.  Professionally shot and edited, this DVD features multiple viewpoints and insightful interviews with students who have disabilities.  This film forces the viewer to rethink any preconceived notions about disabilities and in the process helps to erase the social stigmas that have long plagued the term ""disability.""  The end result is an emphasis on the fact that everyone has challenges, but more importantly everyone has strengths to contribute to the world.  Highly recommended for everyone ages 10 and up as a means to learn and model advocacy.",1228348800,2,791,5.726495726495727
8302195,5,B001FOPSZC,"I was approached by one of my teachers to be a part of this movie, and eagerly I said yes.  My brother suffers from Prader Willie Syndrome which is partly mental retardation as well as an eating disorder where his brain and body never feel full.  I know that he is one of the most caring people I've ever met and I wanted to help people to understand those like him.  For all those out there with brothers, sister, sons, daughter with disabilities I urge you to buy a copy of this movie if not for yourself, for someone who would benefit from its story.  As a student who worked on the film, I am greatly pleased with its effect and hope that it continues to spread.  I know its an influential piece and I am so happy to have been a part in it.  I hope you all enjoy. :-)",1223769600,2,771,4.072847682119205
8302196,5,B001FOPSZC,A great resource for any kid or parent that has struggled with disability issues.  There is nothing like this out there anywhere!  These are kids and their mentor telling their own stories with all of the dignity they possess and deserve.  Kudos to all involved for their truth and commitment to people in our world that want to be understood.,1222128000,,343,4.683333333333334
