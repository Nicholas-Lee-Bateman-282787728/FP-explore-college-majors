7864782,3,6304208359,"This is a pretty strange, creepy movie.
The cinematograpy is pretty lavish, with interesting imagery of scattering white flower petals and constantly billowing opaque curtains blowing in the wind at night.  The  people are all beautiful, if conniving and evil.  This movie contains a  surprisingly large amount of adult-grade erotic content (lesbian kisses,  rape scenes, nudity), so is not one for the kids.
Overall, this one makes  for an interesting night, and if it just had more character development and  a somewhat more sophisticated plot, the luscious imagery, fantastic  atmosphere, other various interesting touches would make this film a  recommended one in my opinion.",945043200,5,680,5.461538461538462
