5968251,5,B00F6G97OS,Great show. Can't wait for season 2 to come out in dub,1405382400,,54,3.5833333333333335
5968252,5,B00F6G97OS,"Kirito's newest adventure involves rescuing Asuna as well as the other 300 players from SAO whose minds are imprisoned in the new MMO server, ALFheim Online.  We are also introduced to his foster sister/cousin, Suguha Kirigaya(also known as Leafa), who joins Kirito in his quest along with Yui.  The new arc introduces a colorful slew of characters, fantastic battles of magic and swordsplay, as well as an intriguing plot.  The main villain of this arc is also considerably more sinister than the previous one.  Whereas Heathcliff/Kayaba merely wanted to create a new 'world' that was less arbitrary than the real one,  Oberon intends to use his technology to ""reprogram"" people's actual souls and enslave them to his will.",1400112000,,724,5.101694915254237

5968254,4,B00F6G97OS,"Had a whopping what, 5 episodes? As noted earlier, extras are only textless intro/ending. Nice anime but a tad pricey for an impulse buy.",1396051200,,137,4.75
5968255,4,B00F6G97OS,"Its been a few months after the events of SAO, and Kirito is trying to get back into the feelings of real life.  However all is not well as he discovers 300 people, including Asuna have not been released as promised.  But a friend from SAO shows him a picture from a new VRMMO - Alfiem Online of a cage in a giant tree, and in it is Asuna.  Now he must don the NerveGear again to enter a new world of fairies, magic and monsters with his ""daughter"" Yui in order to try to reach the world tree and confront the ruler before someone can bring about a darker plan and take Asuna away forever.

I agree with the other person that without the penalty of death the story did not have the same punch as the first season, but still was enjoyable.  The new system including magic, flight and PvP did make it sound like a fairie style setting, also new characters both in real life and online both good and bad.  Still if you enjoyed the first season, you will enjoy the lighter tone that this season brings to you.",1389571200,2,1005,4.181347150259067

8612690,5,B00F6G97OS,"Don't let the headline fool you. I ADORE the SAO series. The premise, the personal stories inside the overall story, the incredible animation and graphics, it's all dreamy. Kirito is someone I identify with on a personal level.

My problem is the PRICE.

Almost $57 for FOUR episodes, and the only collected series available are for European sale!

It is OUTRAGEOUS!!! Until the prices come down, I won't be buying any anime SAO.",1440201600,,429,4.8493150684931505
