So we are probably looking at Nov. 3, 2015 for the release of the extended edition for the BOTFA and the extended trilogy set maybe at the same time, taking into account that this trilogy set is being released at the same time as BOTFA. Even though I haven't seen the movie yet, I'm giving it five stars since I enjoyed the first two movies of the trilogy. I'm hoping that they will have a box case available similar to the one that was made available for the three original extended movies.",1424390400,58,723,4.246376811594203
7006150,4,B00TFOKJ8A,"Ever since the classic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy ended, fans were clamoring for JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" to be adapted for film as well. After all, ""The Hobbit"" contains the seeds of the sequel trilogy's plot, so it made sense.

But instead of a straightforward adaptation of Bilbo Baggins' linear adventures, director Peter Jackson sets the stage for everything to come in his earlier movies. In addition to Bilbo finding the Ring, it is about the corruption of Middle-Earth as the Dark Lord returns to conquer everything. It has some notable flaws (primarily the contrived love story) and isn't quite as brilliant as the ""Rings"" trilogy, but the overall effect is a strong, epic story with a sublimely talented cast.

Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago, and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. He especially wants the Arkenstone, a jewel that symbolizes kingship of the dwarves. Bilgo soon gets into the swing of the journey, despite vicious trolls, goblins, giants and an albino orc who literally wants Thorin's head (preferably separated from the rest of him).

But unknown to the dwarves, Bilbo has encountered a grotesque creature known as Gollum (Andy Serkis), and found a golden ring that gives invisibility. He uses this Ring -- and his newly acquired courage -- to survive the attacks by giant spiders of Mirkwood, and later avoid imprisonment by the deadly wood-elf King Thranduil (Lee Pace) and his son Legolas (Orlando Bloom).

When they reach Erebor, Bilbo is sent in alone to find the Arkenstone... and accidentally wakes Smaug, who immediately figures out what Bilbo is doing there, and goes on a burn-everything-to-the-ground rampage over the human city of Laketown. The only one who has a chance of stopping him is the stalwart archer Bard (Luke Evans) -- but even with Smaug gone, Thorin's paranoia and growing madness spark off a war between the dwarves, humans and their wood-elf allies.

While all this is going on, the wizard Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, poisoning the forest and raising the dead. Gandalf believes that this may mean that Sauron is returning to his old power, and starts snooping in old mountain graves and the ruins of Dol Guldur. But what he finds is more horrifying than anyone in the White Council expected.

""The Hobbit Trilogy"" is not adapted ONLY from Tolkien's original novel, which is a very linear and simple story written in a childlike manner. Peter Jackson mined a lot of material from the ""Lord of the Rings'"" appendices, which give background information on Sauron's rise and the way that the White Council attacked him at Dol Guldur. Since Tolkien himself once considered rewriting ""The Hobbit"" to make it more closely tie in to ""Lord of the Rings,"" it's not that strange an idea.

And rather than a trilogy of movies, the ""Hobbit Trilogy"" feels more like a very long movie divided into thirds -- ""An Unexpected Journey"" is the setup and the beginning of the plot; ""The Desolation of Smaug"" expands the plot and cast, while building up to the grand finale; ""The Battle of Five Armies"" is the climax, when everything from the preceding films rushes together into one vast, glorious battle. In fact, the third movie's titular battle is so long and complicated that it dominates most of the movie.

And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy, or the sinuous, slithering Smaug filling the stone caverns with fire. Some of the fat could have been trimmed, but most of the stuff here is pretty solid.

The biggest problem? The whole subplot involving Tauriel. Don't get me wrong -- she's a good character and Evangeline Lilly does an excellent job, but the whole idea of her falling in love with resident hot dwarf Kili is painfully cheesy and goopy. Also, the whole character of Alfred. Why is he there?

Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves and earning their respect. It's too bad that he often is sidelined, since he IS the titular hobbit. Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but Jackson shows audiences how much loss, pain and humiliation he has suffered over the years. By the third movie, Thorin is a tragic figure who is crumbling under the weight of his own hubris.

There are many familiar faces -- McKellen, the elegant Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving, a typically acrobatic Bloom as a younger and less experienced Legolas, and the sonorous-voiced Christopher Lee. Benedict Cumberbatch deserves special praise for giving a silken-voiced sadism to Smaug, and there are some amazing performances from Evans as a stalwart, noble man who fiercely loves his family; McCoy as a delightfully scatterbrained wizard who spends all his time with animals; and Pace as a sinuous, elegant elf king with a raw core of pain.

One thing to note is that this is the theatrical trilogy, not the extended director's cut that will presumably be out in a year or so. The difference is not as striking as it was in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but it does feel like the theatrical cut is missing some stuff.

It has some flaws like the cheesy love story, but ""The Hobbit Trilogy"" is a strong, majestic prequel to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, mingling fantasy adventure with a sense of Shakespearean tragedy. Just don't expect a direct adaptation.",1424304000,23,5957,4.921314741035856

7006258,4,B00TFOKJ8A,"I'm not near as excited to get the Hobbit trilogy as I was the LOTR trilogy.  The Hobbit movies just aren't as good overall, the battle scenes aren't as good, especially the last battle.  Bilbo isn't as likeable in the movies as he seemed to be in the book. In the book yes Bilbo was quite put off initially by these dwarves showing up.  But then he became charming.  Gandalf character was good in the movie, Radagast and Beorn characters were good, as were the dwarves, except Thorin, which they made too insecure.  The first movie I didn't like the almost disney-like escape from the cave.  Second movie I didn't like how the orcs were running around Dale unnoticed.  And third movie the battle at end was terribly disappointing, especially the eagles. Also, the orcs in Hobbit were more like super-orcs on steroids.  I guess we should be fortunate they made LOTR first.
On its own, the Hobbit is a great story and are great movies.  Just something missing for me and part of that is due to how great LOTR were and part of it just the chemistry in this movie wasn't as compelling as I would have hoped.",1431993600,3,1104,4.48

Tolkien but this movie drags a very short story out into a 9 hour series of films.  Whereas the Lord of the Rings was 3 long books compressed into 12 (extended cut) hours, The Hobbit was 3 long movies stretched out of the short source story.

The movie didn't have quite the chemistry of the characters LotR did and Legolas' character in particular was much more bitter and cynical in this film where he portrays his younger self than the character he portrayed (who was much more light-hearted) in LotR.  It's always fun to see a reunion of cast such as Elrond, Gandalf, Lady Galadriel, and Saruman.  Bilbo was portrayed will though I thought Thorin was a bit more surly throughout the entire movie than I would have expected.

In all, this was done well.  It's full of beautiful scenery and provides lots of action.  But this does not earn the same high regards in my movie library collection that Lord of the Rings does and it will not be watched as frequently.",1430784000,4,1101,4.49748743718593

7006297,2,B00TFOKJ8A,"2001-2003. Peter Jackson stunned the world with his adaptations of the famous Lord of the Rings trilogy. They took the world by storm.  If you hadn't heard of Tolkien's Magnum Opus, you certainly were one to find out quickly as these movies came out.  They were emotional, touching, thrilling, and just all around epic.  A series worthy to have a trilogy.  Peter Jackson really did capture a certain magic in these films.  A magic that is still present and holds up to this very day.

And now, if you'll permit me to borrow some dialogue from Jurassic Park.

And you know what, Mr. Jackson, before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you're selling it, you wanna sell it.  The Hobbit trilogy.

Yeah, as you might be able to tell, I'm not the biggest fan of this trilogy.  I'm not going to bring up corporate greed in the. Releasing this trilogy u extended. I really don't care about that. I'm reviewing the movies. Now before I get all sorts of accusations and hate from the fans who are just accusing me of saying I hate it because it changed so much from the book, let me just say this.  ""Calm the heck down.  There's more to it than you think.""  I have more problems than simple changes from the book, because unlike a lot of people, I understand that an adaptation is what it is.  An adaptation.  Adaptations make changes.  I understand that, and am open to that concept.  Even the Lord of the Rings trilogy diverted from certain things the books had.  I guess what made that trilogy so strong however, was that the changes didn't change so much of the original story, and were changes that people could see making sense.  The Hobbit trilogy...not so much.

My main problem with the trilogy, is that honestly...I only see Peter Jackson trying to convince us that this was somehow supposed to either surpass, or be just as epic as the Lord of the Rings...and that is just something that isn't possible.  Firstly, the Hobbit when it was originally written by Tolkein was a very simple tale.  I've read the book before,, and can say that the Hobbit was much simpler than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and it was very much a story for children.  Peter Jackson aimed to give us this...grand adventure.  Am I saying the Hobbit isn't a grand adventure?  No.  It's a classic. But Jackson went about it in way too many wrong ways.  Ways that backfired.

And permit me to be a little...hurt in some ways that were different from the book. I can't say I have no problems with changes from the book, because there are some things that just did not sit well with me.  And the very first thing that comes to mind was the constant foreshadowing of Sauron.  ESPECIALLY in movie two, Desolation of Smaug.  Sauron isn't even mentioned in the book.  If I remember right the ""necromancer"" is mentioned, which does become Sauron, but there is no corruption of the Ring, and Bilbo uses it rather...freely.  In fact, Bilbo treats it like any other person would treat a ring.  He finds it, it's a nice little thing to take home. He puts it on, finds out it can make him invisible, and uses it to his advantage here.  He doesn't feel the presence of Sauron as he seems to in the movies, he doesn't lose it, find it and call it ""mine"" like Gollum would, heck it's just a ring in the book.  So why the sudden change?  Not only did it ruin one of my favorite moments of the book (the conversation with Bilbo and Smaug), but as a guy who knows who the villain of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is going to be, just saw this as a move that wasn't necessary and dumb.  On the scene I just mentioned, I really enjoyed the talk that Bilbo and Smaug have.  Bilbo keeps Smaug on his nerve, and constantly confuses Smaug as Smaug cannot find Bilbo because he is wearing the ring.  He is making Smaug somewhat nervous perhaps, on the edge, and angry with the constant riddles that Bilbo rains down from all over the place.  Reading it is suspenseful, and thrilling, and rivals some of the most thrilling moments of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Once Bilbo removed the ring in the movie, I just had to shout in my mind ""No!"" because all the elements of suspense and thrill were effectively killed right then and there. Smaug should have just eaten Bilbo right then and there.  Heck...as awesome as Smaug looked, he really didn't act like the dragon I hoped he would.  In fact, once he was killed, I was sort of thankful, because as threatening as he was trying to seem in the movies....he was pathetic. He built himself up both in movie and book (good job on nailing his boasting, I enjoyed that scene), but My god, when he's chasing the dwarves all around Erabor, when he's facing Bard the Bowman, and just making simple threats ""You cannot save him from the fire, he will burn!"" all I'm thinking is...WHY ARE YOU TALKING?! BURN HIM!  Smaug is killed by the classic villain movie mistake of talking too much?  Come on! I mean I know Smaug has this reputation of thinking he's above them all, but....I hate to constantly bring up the book, but in the book, he just straight up razed the town, not taking anything from anybody.

I'm going to return to Sauron briefly, because though I will say that Jackson's inclusion of Gandalf's ""side-quest"" in the movies was...an okay move.  Again, I don't think it was necessary, but if Jackson was gonna squeeze a trilogy out of this one book, I guess he had to think of something.  But the execution of this side-quest was bad too....because at it's finale, I was wondering if Jackson even remembered making the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  One thing I just don't get is why Gladriel was so amazingly powerful in this trilogy.  In the Lord of the Rings trilogy, she is described as a terror almost.  A being of immense power.  I am sorry to say I can't remember the exact words used to describe her in the movies, but she was built up incredibly.  And in the movies...as Cinemasins pointed out...all she does is send the Fellowship out with some magic trinkets...after she almost single-handedly banishes Sauron's form to Mordor...by herself in the Hobbit movies.  What the hell?  I'll give credit that Saruman does say that the confrontation has severely weakened her, but still....she's built up in the next movie trilogy as an elf witch of incredible power.  It just doesn't add up to me.  I can't say I've read the short story that talks about this thing with Gandalf discovering Sauron, but....still.  I also feel that the banishment of Sauron, and Saruman's mentioning of the Ring of Power, would have immediately clicked in Gandalf's mind.  Like ""Oh wow, I think Bilbo might have something of interest here!""  In fact, it's not until years later in the original trilogy that Gandalf gets suspicions.  I mean...once again...as Cinemasins points out, did Jackson even bother watching his Lord of the Rings Trilogy?  Heck, wouldn't they at least INQUIRE about Bilbo's ring?  (Special thanks to CinemaSins.  Love your videos.)

Speaking of Bilbo.....in a trilogy that is entitled ""The Hobbit"", there is surprisingly very little story about the Hobbit.  That's something the book nailed.  It focuses almost entirely on Bilbo.  There are scenes with Thorin and the other dwarves, but it mainly focuses on his perspective.  Here...it jumps all over the place.  From the Gandalf side-quest, to a dwarf and elf love story, to Laketown politics...look, I was open to these things...  I was open to the character Tauriel.  I was open to the Bard's lowered rank (in the book if I remember right, he's already a well respected member of Laketown), but they just didn't get executed well enough.  I thought the unlikely love story between Kili and Tauriel was rushed, and just...silly.  I rub my head in annoyance everytime I hear that clichd line of ""If this is love I don't want it!"" Seriously, I haven't heard such bland dialogue since Attack of the Clones.  It was a clever move to get us to remember one of the dwarven names out of the 13 that travel with Bilbo...I'll give it that much.  Fili, Kili, Thorin...I can name maybe three more before I come to the conclusion that they weren't meant to be remembered because this is a story about...BILBO.  And yet Martin's talents are wasted with him standing off to the side while Jackson tries to entertain us with over-the-top action sequences and battles that just bored the hell out of me.  I mean seriously, I thought that Legolas' action in the Lord of the Rings trilogy from shield-surfing to taking down an Oliphant with three arrows to the neck was bad enough.  His gravity defying jumping of bricks and dwarf heads, to over the top combat near the river, and Legolas isn't the only one guilty of this.  Tauriel shoots an arrow that deflects an already shot arrow in the air?!  I understand that Elves are superior fighters in every way to men and orcs, but there are things in these movies that are pulled off that are by all means, near impossible.

If I had to select a movie that I actually enjoyed in this trilogy...strangely, it's the first movie, Unexpected Journey.  Because it was successful in making me want to see more.  It was successful in raising my eyebrow.  It was slow, and wasn't perfect, but the changes that were made were fun enough.  The clever tie-in of trying to reclaim Moria, and how Thorin earned his title was fun to watch.  It made me want to see a sequel.  It wasn't a perfect start, and many critics agree with that, but it made me anxious for the next year.  Desolation dragged.  And it was where I started to see the major problems with these films.  It just wasn't working.  Again, there were things that were great.  But by the time Battle of the Five Armies hit, I sat there, just bored out of my mind.  The third movie made the second movie's dragging look like the Kentucky Derby.  I mean there was barely a hint of story from what I saw.  It was just dragged too much.

I will take the side of some when I say this.  This trilogy should not have been a trilogy.  If Jackson wanted to make The Hobbit, fine.  Why stretch it into a trilogy (other than a cash grab)?  Why add in so much and try to convince us that this adventure is supposed to rival the adventures of the Lord of the Rings trilogy?  There were three books, which made sense that it would garner a trilogy (My God can you imagine if each individual book of the trilogy garnered their own trilogy of films? Shoot me).  All of them were long, but they were far from boring.  Even the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings movie, while adding more to already long films, keep your interest!  The Hobbit should not have gone any longer than two movies.  If Jackson wanted to add more, fine...why drag?  Because this trilogy didn't even come close to matching the trilogy that follows.  It may have hit home in a few places, again, I think that Martin was a perfect actor for Bilbo, Smaug looked fantastic, and despite what I've said, there was some very fun action in these movies.  And despite the fact that the obvious green-screening effect can be noticeable...there were times that these movies were just gorgeous to look at. But they fail to hold up the trilogy on their own, which brings me to my final verdict.

The Hobbit Trilogy all in all....is a two out of four (five) stars.  These movies are painfully average.  Maybe even below average.  I would score it even lower, but there is enough to warrant a score of at least one viewing.  But as far as these being considered a classic prequel trilogy...I have to say these movies are very forgettable.  It's a shame I have to call it that, because honestly, I love the story of the Hobbit.  But we just have a classic case of Jackson trying to do what Lucas did with Star Wars, by trying to convince us that these would be just as fun and just as greatly executed as the trilogies that would follow them chronologically.  And they ultimately fail to do that.",1430006400,11,11953,4.530841121495327

Before there was Blu-Ray I owned all the LOTR movies in their Extended Edition sets, but when I purchased the LOTR Trilogy on Blu-Ray, I got the theatrical versions because the extended editions were too drawn out for me.

Same goes for this trilogy, if you like what you saw in theaters, this is perfectly fine as your final set. If you like a lot of special features and extended scenes, obviously you should wait and not spend unneeded money. Also, I assume there will be some ULTIMATE set coming this Christmas with all 6 movies, so you can wait for that too if you'd like.

7006318,4,B00TFOKJ8A,"Overall, 'The Hobbit' trilogy is a great set of films. The trilogy turned out to be a successful and worthy predecessor to the award winning, highly acclaimed, 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. All three 'Hobbit' films offer excellent special fx, music (score), and make up/costume design. The cast and crew did remarkably well at bringing author J.R.R. Tolkien's sprawling fantasy world to life. While the story set in 'The Hobbit' is not as grand in scale, epic, or as dark as 'Lord of the Rings', the trilogy still is impressive and exciting. Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo Baggins, Ian McKellen reveals another splendid Gandalf as he did in 'Lord of the Rings', and Richard Armitage performs a memorable performance as Thorin Oakenshield. And lets not forget Benedict Cumberbatch's breathtaking, and groundbreaking, performance as Smaug the magnificent. My only two real gripes about 'The Hobbit' trilogy is the overuse of cgi and the fact that it should've been two films (as originally planned) not three. The overabundence of cgi makes the film feel a bit less organic and real like 'Lord of the Rings' did and stretching a three hundred fourty page book into three films felt unecessary and bloated at some points. The plot sticks fairly well to the book, just stretched with many additions (some being enjoyable plot from 'Lord of the Rings' appendices, while some scenes unecessary). But, although 'The Hobbit' trilogy has its faults and has that less epic story than 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, it stands as a successfully worthy predessor that ties in remarkably with the next trilogy of films. I was overall satisfied with these movies for the past three years. Peter Jackson did a great job! Extended Editions are highly worth it as well. I can't wait for 'The Battle of the Five Armies' Extended Edition!",1429315200,48,1823,4.96078431372549

7006392,5,B00TFOKJ8A,I personnally want the Theater version now and will buy the extended cut possibly later. The movies were good that I saw in the theater so there!!!,1426982400,12,147,4.481481481481482
7006393,5,B00TFOKJ8A,"Seriously it is really pathetic leaving a one star review and screaming about how warner bros is stealing your money and that this is a scam. SOME PEOPLE WANT THE THEATRICAL VERSIONS!!!!!!!! Not to mention most people I talk to want less movies anyway.  Not everybody is a hardcore fan who will watch the extended versions, I personally am, but im not going to cry over the fact that the theatrical versions are available for purchase. Read that last sentence again if you have been to fully understand why its pathetic. Yes, the extended box set will arrive one day, it will be glorious and you don't ever have to watch the OG versions again. Until then, stop crying like a privileged republican and try to understand other peoples perspective.",1426982400,12,745,4.730769230769231
7006394,4,B00TFOKJ8A,"Great Movies, not sure why people are rating the actual film here. I'm more interested in hearing about product quality from a review on Amazon.",1426896000,4,144,4.8
7006395,1,B00TFOKJ8A,"Wait till November, worth the wait for the Extended version.",1426809600,9,60,5.1
7006396,5,B00TFOKJ8A,"I've read a lot of negative reviews saying, ""Wait for the extended release. Don't waste your money."" The theatrical releases are too long already. To be perfectly honest they should have either re-edited the first two to have the Battle of the five armies included and saved us all the trouble of a third film or have a trilogy with shorted runtimes. So I say meh to the extended release. Buy this one and save yourself time.",1426636800,11,425,4.532467532467533
7006397,2,B00TFOKJ8A,The 3-D version of the trilogy is available elsewhere for half the price.,1426464000,4,73,4.6923076923076925
7006398,1,B00TFOKJ8A,"We all know the extended edition trilogy is coming in six months to a year.  This item is an attempt to milk as much money as possible out of the franchise now, and in six months try to sell you an even better trilogy for a few dollars more.

Same thing they did with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Be smart, wait a few months.",1426377600,10,328,3.9393939393939394
7006399,1,B00TFOKJ8A,So so greedy. We obviously want the extended cut but they have to milk it.,1426204800,10,74,4.0
7006400,2,B00TFOKJ8A,Most likely Oct is when the extended edition will come out or Nov. Just like past years... I'll be waiting not getting my money til then.,1426204800,9,137,4.3076923076923075

LOVE the movies though!",1522368000,,215,4.2439024390243905

8701525,4,B00TFOKJ8A,"The Trilogy was everything I hoped for and more! It made Tolkien's book come alive, and it was extremely accurate (aside from a few very, very minor differences between the book and movie(s), as there are between every single book that's been made into a film. If you have read and are a fan of The Hobbit, then you will absolutely be enthralled with the film trilogy. The case has 9 discs total; 3 Blu-Rays, 3 DVD's and a Special features disc for every movie (not Blu-Ray). I have to say this is one of the best things that I have purchased on Amazon.

That being said...I rated this 4, not 5 stars for a few reasons. 1. the plastic on the top left hand corner of the Blu-Ray case was slightly cracked, so that there was a small hole. I have posted a picture of the hole in the case down below. 2. I watched all three movies using the DVD's instead of the Blu-Rays for time's sake, as they generally take a longer time to load up than a regular DVD. For both The Unexpected Journey, and The Desolation of Smaug, DVDs, I experienced at least one 'glitch,' where the movie would stop playing, and the TV screen would go black for 3 or 4 seconds. Then they would start up again, and I would be able to finish them with no problems. 3. the movie case does not close very well, making it too easy to open. Once again I have posted a picture of the hole in the case.

Other than those three minor inconveniences, nothing else was wrong; I really enjoyed the movies, and I would never regret getting the trilogy.",1505260800,,1507,4.265734265734266
