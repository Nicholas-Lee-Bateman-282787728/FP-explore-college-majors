1200626,5,B00000F356,"Okay, the story is well known and this naturally will run comparisons to Lord Larry and Merle Oberon's 1939 version.  But this is a gentle, atmospheric retelling that is well acted.
Excellently cast, Caulder-Marshall is super as the willful Cathy that loves Heathcliff, but must face choices in her life to save them both, which ultimately drives them apart, changes them, but cannot alter the deep love that drives them - even if it drives them to destroy each other.  Dalton is properly Welsh, dark and brooding, very adapt at showing his younger vunerability, and later the darker, sensual side.  The gorgeous Ian Ogilvy is a perfect contrast to Dalton's dark, the fair haired beautiful husband that cannot touch her soul.
An interesting note:  in this movie Ogilvy's sister is played by the same woman that played his wife in the excellent Witchfinder General with Vincent Price.
Well worth the viewing again and again.",1025136000,44,923,4.974025974025974
1200627,2,B00000F356,"This has to be one of the most filmed novels ever, yet no one seems to have ever quite hit the bull's eye -- probably because it is an impossibility. What works on paper does not readily translate to film's visual, linear format, particularly where several generations of people with similar names are concerned.  This 1970 version offers much by way of landscape:  the bleak and wild Yorkshire moors, the isolation, and the contrasts between the Earnshaw and Linton households are well made.  But liberties are taken with the plot (Cathy and Heathcliff consumate their relationship, for instance -- a shrieking departure from the source), the acting is uneven and there is a noisy hysteria running throughout.  If you want a good ""movie"" experience, stick with William Wyler's 1939 original.  If you want a valiant, intriguing but failed attempt, see the later (1992) version with Juliette Binoche (Cathy with a faint French accent?  hmmm) and Ralph Fiennes (hair dyed donkey black, eyes like smashed glass).  There is an endless UK television version afloat (with Janet McTeer as Ellen), and a strange Spanish version (Bunuel) out there too. Best bet?  read the book and do the envisioning yourself.",1013817600,13,1201,5.060913705583756
1200628,5,B00000F356,"This version has haunted me for decades since seeing it presented on tv in the early 70s.  I searched high and low to finally find it on VHS several years ago-- (when it was available for a very short time)-- then had to scour collectable LP stores for years to find the soundtrack by Michel LeGrand (never released on CD, unfortunately) and paid someone to transfer it to CD before CD burners were available.  Well, I'd thought my eyes had decieved me when I saw this DVD.  Yes, there are more recent versions of Wuthering Heights that more closely cover Bronte's book, but arguably none have you feeling the bone chilling winds over the moors nor capture the darkness of the tragedy in a more memorable way.",1013817600,16,709,4.566929133858268
1200629,5,B00000F356,"I was so excited when I found this movie on Amazon.com.  I ordered it with another old favorite I found here.  When I finally got around to watching it it brought back memories of seeing it on the big screen in the early 70's.  Timothy Dalton is fantastic as Heathcliff....brooding, sensual, and not too hard to look at.  The movie is beautifully done, and the music is haunting.  One of the only remakes of a movie that I can say was worth seeing.  What I enjoyed most was my daughters seeing it, they loved it too.",1013126400,14,516,4.322916666666667
1200630,4,B00000F356,"This is one of several romantic classics adaptions which were made in the wake of the huge popularity of Zefferelli's ROMEO AND JULIET in the 60's and 70's. Though purists will find this to be a Classics Illustrated version of Bronte's dark and complex story, it is nevertheless a finely crafted film with a beautiful and haunting score by Michel Legrand which the lush DVD soundtrack shows to full effect. Timothy Dalton is a perfect Heathcliff on a par with Olivier's Hollywood version. He digs deep into this tortured man's soul. Anna Caulder-Marshall is less convincing as Cathy, although few if any actresses have ever assayed the part better(Miss Marshall was burdened with an artificial leg, but this is not evident in her performance). I remember this film with affection as an artifact of it's time and the DVD has brought it back in full glory. If you enjoy well made historical romances as I do, you will want to add this film to your library.",1010534400,13,954,4.753012048192771
1200631,4,B00000F356,"I was very intrigued to see this version of ""Wuthering Heights,"" especially because Timothy Dalton plays Heathcliff (and he also plays Rochester in my favorite adaptation of ""Jane Eyre""). Certainly he does the spirit and passion of the Bront sisters justice in both movies.
Although it's definitely worth viewing, I can't give this film the highest rating for a couple of reasons: 1) It strays so far from the book--especially at the end regarding Heathcliff's fate--that it's jarring if you know the story well; 2) Anna Calder-Marshall's performance as Catherine is a bit too loony. At  times, she's so kooky and wild-eyed that she isn't the least bit attractive.
Still, the locations are effective, and the windy moors disturbing and realistic. And Dalton is mesmerizing. I would have liked to have seen the script go into more detail and stick more faithfully to the book. I think the definitive version of ""Wuthering Heights"" is yet to be made.",1009929600,12,948,5.0

1200707,2,B00000F356,"The title and a few characters' names is all this film has in common with Emily Bronte's classic story.  Nearly everything that has made the novel endure for 168 years is eliminated in this ""adaptation.""  Gone are the multigenerational tragedies, the passioniate obsession that endures for decades and beyond the grave, the haunting gothic elements, the complex interrelationships.  Here the landscape is sunnily bright and neatly manicured.  Heathcliff is a mumbling brute, Cathy a capricious brat, and everyone else is reduced to mere set dressing.  Little of the original plot remains, replaced instead with cookie-cutter cliches at the level of a Harlequin Romance.  Not even a broodingly handsome 26-year-old Timothy Dalton saves it from being well-filmed but tiresome twaddle.  If it's Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights"" you're looking for, choose the versions with Ralph Fiennes or Robert Cavanah instead.",1410307200,,906,5.569343065693431

I watched and fell in love with the 2009 version and subsequently read the book. I was under the impression that the second half had been removed by YouTube, but of course I was wrong. This version as well as the 1939 version completely butchers a great classic. The acting however was great, and that's the sole reason I'm giving this piece three stars instead of two.

He is a magnificent actor and not bad to look at either.  I could watch him forever.

Dalton does a masterful job of portraying Heathcliff's dark raw unbridled passion. His tortured conflict about Cathy is told from only a brooding glance.

That version is excellent as well. I saw this Timothy Dalton/Anna Caulder-Marshall version years ago and I never forgot it, so I was happy to be able to see it again on DVD.  This version takes some liberties with the novel, one being that it implies that Heathcliff was perhaps a half-brother of Cathy.  Timothy Dalton is the quintessential Heathcliff. In fact, all of the actors did a great job. The movie, and especially the music, captures the brooding atmosphere of Wuthering Heights. If you are a Bronte fan, this is definitely worth watching despite the deviated ending.",1358467200,,735,4.967479674796748

The big treat for me in this rendition, was watching a super young Timothy Dalton, playing Heathcliff. Those beautiful flashing eyes of his and that brooding face, just worked for me, in making Heathcliff come alive on the screen.

I didn't much care for Anna Calder- Marshall as Cathy. She came across as whiney, and dull. My favorite portayal of Cathy would have to be Juliette Binoche's.

 I also didn't like the way they cut the story, and changed the ending around in this version; but all in all, I did thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1332892800,2,675,4.793103448275862

The scenery and the costuming were good.  For the rest, it was a very dull movie due to the bland script and uninspired acting.  This screen adaptation of the movie was geared more toward trying to recreate the enthusiasm that surrounded Romeo and Juliet (1968) than exploring the overwrought dark romanticism of the book Wuthering Heights.

Mr. Dalton was the only saving grace in this overblown production featuring a future Bond and Indiana Jones villain (Julian  Glover). I did not sense any fire from Anna Calder-Marshall as Cathy, who looked a little too old for the role. I've yet to see the 1992 film version starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Bionche. The screenplay for this version was extremely bad, with the exception of one scene:-SPOILER AHEAD!!!-When Heathcliff (Timothy Dalton) and Isabella Linton are kissing aall the way through when Herathcliff escapes on horseback. I can't remember all the liberties taken, as it's been several years since I read the novel, but I COMPLETELY HATED THE ENDING TO THIS VERSION!!! SPOILER AHEAD!!! The villainous Hindley Earnshaw shoots Heathcliff, who dies soon after. SPOILER OVER!!! Apart from the scene not being in the book, it wasn't even filmed correctly. That scene completely destroyed what Ms. Bronte intended through the novel, and which the 1939 film version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier, in his breakout role, as Heathcliff, conveyed: the torment of lost love. Not Rated, but I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FILM VERSION.

1200884,2,B00000F356,"I first saw this movie when I was a teenager, maybe twelve or thirteen years of age. I was so affected by Timothy Dalton's performance as Heathcliff that it stayed with me all my life. When I later read the novel at fifteen, it was Dalton's face and performance that I envisioned with every word.

Thirty years have passed since I last saw this movie and I was curious to see it again and determine whether it would hold up.  It did not.  What a disappointment.

My only reason for giving this movie two stars instead of one is because it does capture the overall dark, tempestuous mood and setting of the novel...and because of Timothy Dalton's sometimes good (but too often erratic) performance.  At first, I wondered what it was about Dalton's portrayal that so affected me as a youth.  And then came the scene in Cathy's bedroom as she is dying.  For those few moments--as Dalton clings to her and says ""I could as soon forget you as my life. Are you not satisfied that I'm in hell already? ...Nothing in this world could have put us apart, but you of your own will did it.  I have not broken your heart. You have.""--I saw a vulnerable, anguished, heartbroken Heathcliff resurrected from Bronte's own words. Dalton perfectly captures Heathcliff's savagery and all-consuming love for Cathy.  Other reviewers here have complained that Dalton overacts, but I don't fully agree.  Bronte's novel IS over the top--these two lovers are only reunited in death, after all--and I thought Dalton's histrionics fitting for that final scene with Cathy.  I have seen the 1939 version but I've always felt that Laurence Olivier was too refined to play Heathcliff correctly.  Heathcliff is supposed to be a sadistic brute--a tortured, wounded animal determined to destroy everyone and everything in repayment for his own suffering.

The problem is not with Dalton's acting; rather, it's with Cathy's.  Anna Calder-Marshall fails to equal Dalton's passion and left me wondering what exactly Heathcliff found so compelling about her.  Calder-Marshall is miscast as Cathy.  She's neither willful nor magnetic. I thought she was just plain weird. The screenplay itself is terrible--did the screenwriter read the entire novel?  Not even the casting of Timothy Dalton can save a rotten script.

Finally, the gratuitous sexual references in this movie are a huge mistake that cheapen the relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff instead of elevating it...and miss the whole point of the novel, which is that Cathy and Heathcliff's love is so extraordinary that it transcends the physical and earthly plane.

The only reason this movie is worth watching is to see Timothy Dalton. I still think he had the potential to be a good Heathcliff.  The real tragedy in this movie is not Cathy's death; instead, it is that Dalton was not given a script and a supporting cast that allowed him to live up to his promise.",1248048000,5,2890,4.907407407407407
1200885,1,B00000F356,Good performance by Dalton but I don't know what this movie was about.  It certainly wasn't Wuthering Heights!,1233964800,3,110,5.111111111111111
1200908,3,B00000F356,"There's something about the tragically obsessed Wuthering Heights lovers in this film that doesn't please me.

First, the director took enormous and inappropriate liberties with the novel, in some instances wandering off the plotline altogether.  Like the Olivier/Oberon version, this movie concerns itself only with the first third of the novel and concludes with Cathy's death, thus ignoring the disturbing extent of Heathcliff's twisted revenge on Hindley, Linton, Isabella, and Cathy herself through the coldly pre-meditated ruination of their children. Broadly limned -- and nothing whatsoever to do with the book -- is an idiotic undercurrent of unrequited love which a fawning and fatuous Nelly bears for the boorish Hindley.  Worst of all, Heathcliff perishs by Hindley's hand in the movie, in direct defiance of the novel.

Second, the casting of jug-eared Calder-Marshall was an embarrassment. While she managed to carry off the willful heroine component, I found myself constantly distracted by the debatable questions of whether or not her head was in fact too large for her diminutive body or if her bodily proportions bordered on dwarfism.  She must have been a costumer's nightmare.  In one scene I was appalled to see her in a too-big, billowing cloak gallumping alongside the tall and graceful Timothy Dalton like his little gnomish companion.

Dalton acquitted himself well in the part of Heathcliff.  While a little too vulpine in appearance to make him perfect, nevertheless both his acting and saturnine appearance were the only things that kept the movie afloat.  The scene where he dis-inters Cathy's coffin and crushs her body to his chest was positively heart-breaking.

Some of the movie's shots were quite wonderful, particularly the wide view of Heathcliff on horseback silhouetted against an enormous Yorkshire sky.

I would be remiss if I did not mention Michel Legrand's lushly romantic score, a personal favorite of mine.  What a pity it's not available on CD. (Note: the soundtrack has become available in a limited edition.  It's lush and exquisite.  If you must, beg, borrow or steal to get your hands on a copy. You'll be glad.)

For my money, the best film adaptation of Wuthering Heights so far is the Fiennes/Binoche version, since it's one of the few to cover the full story after Cathy's demise.  Buy it instead, or perhaps, as well. (Note: The soundtrack to this film is in limited availability but, like the Legrand score, is worth tracking down. Hauntingly romantic, it's good 'un.)",1232409600,3,2526,5.184729064039409

Anyone approaching this film without having read the book, will be bored out of their mind. This truly is an awful film. The direction is stale and the acting is over the top. The viewer will not feel invested in ANY of the characters. Total rubbish!

The difference being that anyone watching this version who knows nothing of the book can leave satisfied. The film does make sense even if it's inaccurate.

 My biggest gripe is Dalton being made up to look like Spock from Star Trek! I guess he's supposed to look ""elvish"" - doesn't work. I keep expecting him to say ""Captain Cathrine. That is not logical."" He also does some real hammy over acting in a few scenes.

 Calder-Marshall does the best job as Cathrine, especially as a half-feral child. Of the three she's the only one I could picture ruuning around in a storm - enjoying it!

By far the best Hindley and Nelly. Both are allowed to be personalities instead of being living props to mouth dialogue.

The original Laurence Oliver version is another 1930's Hollywood Costume Drama. You can stick scenes from ""Gone with the Wind"" (a better movie) and they would fit. (Mayby someones done this on YouTube. Scarlet Cathy and Heathcliff Butler in Wuthering Wind.)

The Daniel Day-Lewis version is just plain bad. To much skipping around. Also they just look silly as adults playing as children. (The Coffin scene is good though!)

After just an hour of the latter (it was poorly done and badly cast), I realized that there could be no better actor than Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff.  Perfectly portrayed as the dark, tall, handsome gypsy - tower of physical strength - which is important in the story.  He and Anna Calder as Catherine are excelent in this movie.  Such passion and fire are evident and spill out of their souls in their acting - the movie may not follow the books' story to point, but it's the best one yet.

While Sir Laurence Olivier and Ralph Fiennes have both done respectable turns as Heathcliff, Timothy Dalton is just glorious!! He embodies the character's passion, ambivalence and consuming torment and longing for Cathy splendidly. Anna Calder-Marshall, while perhaps not one would think would make an ideal Cathy, is wonderful as the Yorkshire lass. Oh, how these two sizzle! Whenever Dalton speaks, or broods, the room temperature just seemed to skyrocket! The ill-fated lovers find themselves separated and bound by circumstance and other people, leading to tragic results.

Sure, the consummation of their relationship did not occur in the book, but with young hot actors like Timothy and Anna, how could the filmmakers not succumb to temptation? The locations (complete with windswept wild moors) and music are intoxicatingly gorgeous as well. I don't know how Emily Bronte would feel about this adaptation, but I'd like to think that this production would have done her proud.

Like some other viewers, I was disappointed that the second generation were not featured and that the ending seemed tacked on.  Those are the only things that stop me from giving this movie 5 stars. Also, I seem to remember a few other scenes from the VHS (there is a still from one of them on the DVD jacket) that are not included on the disc. But this version captured the passion and intensity between Heathcliff and Cathy.

The DVD transfer has been wonderfully restored, a big improvement over the VHS print.  A few specks and scratches show from time to time, and other than that, aside from the hairstyles (which indicate the decade in which it was made), you wouldn't think the movie is 40 years old.

Wuthering Heights is a classic tale about two families. The Lintons live at Thrushcross Grange while the Earnshaws live at the Heights, on the edge of the moors. Mr. Earnshaw brings home a gypsy boy and this creates jealousy and rivalry between his children.  While Catherine becomes refined, Heathcliff turns into a ""beast"" in a way. This is similar to the beauty and the beast at a few points in the story. There is a pretty funny scene where Catherine and Heathcliff enjoy taunting the Lintons.

If ever there was a story of obsessive love, it has been captured it in torturous scenes that contain a certain madness and desire. This is by far the best version of Wuthering Heights I?ve seen so far. I has all the darkest elements combined with fiery passion. The kissing scenes in this movie are highly charged and completely erotic.

Child-like Catherine (Anna Calder-Marshal) and the young gypsy Heathcliff (Timothy Dalton) start off as young sweethearts who are just happy to be with one another out in the French countryside. Soon Catherine becomes obsessed with Heathcliff  and wants him to promise her they will always be friends. She puts a curse on their lives if they ever break the promise. With hands on a stone, their fate is sealed.

Heathcliff  soon becomes Catherine's only reason for living, without him she is in a state of vapid listlessness. He can literally control her with the slightest inattention. When she hears of his love for Isabella, she is tortured in body and soul. She goes to the height and depth of obsessive love.

""I fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice."" ~ Heathcliff

Heathcliff  swears he will never leave, then he does. It drives Catherine into despair. Then he returns when she has given up all hope and has already married Edgar Linton, who rescues her from herself.

I love the line:

""When I'm dead, I think I'll come haunt you as the sunset."" ~Catherine

One of literature's greatest love stories and this is the best adaptation I've seen so far.

A tale of tormented lovers who are destined to be together until the end of time and beyond.

1200986,4,B00000F356,"In the past several months, I've seen at least one film adaptation of all the Jane Austen books, plus one of Charlotte Bronte's JANE EYRE, and this one of sister Emily's WUTHERING HEIGHTS. All at the behest of a good friend hoping to make me a better person. OK, fine. But I refuse to read the original novels.

What I find interesting is the difference in tone, and apparently the states of mind, of Jane versus Emily and Charlotte. Austen's works, while perhaps depicting the lives of its heroines as somewhat silly by today's standards, are at least generally lighthearted. The Brontes' plots - at least the two I've been exposed to - are apocalyptically gloomy. Of course, Jane spent her life in the sunny and pastoral south of England, while Emily and Charlotte hail from the relatively desolate and rock-strewn Yorkshire Moors. Perhaps it's something in the water.

In WUTHERING HEIGHTS, Heathcliff is the young orphan rescued from a life in the streets and brought home by Mr. Earnshaw (Harry Andrews) to live at his Yorkshire farm with his family, which also includes his daughter Cathy and his son Hindley. As they grow through childhood, Cathy and Heathcliff spend their time together roaming the moors, and vow mutual everlasting devotion. For no reason that I could discern, the older Hindley boy resents Heathcliff, but is the one sent away to get expensively educated.

By the time the elder Earnshaw dies, Heathcliff and Cathy are in their late teens, now played by Timothy Dalton and Anna Calder-Marshall respectively. Hindley (Julian Glover), now married, returns from the outside world to claim his inheritance. Heathcliff's fortunes take a bad turn when Hindley relegates him to a position not much better than a farm hand. In the meantime, Cathy lives temporarily in the local magistrate's grand manor house, where she acquires the manners and dress of a ""lady"" and attracts the eye of the judge's son, Edgar (Ian Ogilvy). Eventually returning to her brother's household with superior airs, Cathy essentially wishes Heathcliff would take a bath. To make the first half of the film's story short, Hindley's wife dies soon after giving birth, Hindley drives Heathcliff away to a destination unknown, and Cathy, with nothing better to do, weds Edgar.

Have I spoiled the plot? No, because it doesn't truly get going until Heathcliff, with a wardrobe and personal appearance make-over, suddenly walks in on Hindley and his drunken buds after an absence of three years. The audience never finds out where he's been, but he obviously has an attitude problem and means to settle old scores. (At this point, I was reminded of Dalton's role as France's King Philip in THE LION IN WINTER.) And he's lost none of the raw wildness from those years mucking about the countryside.

My understanding is that this WUTHERING HEIGHTS foreshortens the book, but is faithful to it as far as it goes. Subsequent to Heathcliff's dramatic return, I expected a great ending. What I got was overwrought melodrama as Heathcliff makes himself totally insufferable with all and sundry. He's a social misfit if ever there was one, totally out of his depth. The film's apparent message is that one can't escape his/her upbringing. However, Dalton's dynamite dramatic portrayal is the single best reason to watch, though the cinematography in the magnificently bleak Yorkshire West Riding comes a close second.

WUTHERING HEIGHTS has considerable merit, but give me PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, or EMMA anytime over this. I mean, if I want to observe hysterical wailing and testosterone fueled fisticuffs, all I have to do is attend a staff meeting at work. At least Austen's soaps left me feeling amused.",1051315200,19,3709,5.012987012987013
1200987,2,B00000F356,"I've seen every film version of Wuthering Heights that I know exists, and while this version has some good things going for it, ultimately I can't unreservedly recommend it. First the pros. Location: filmed in the West Riding, Yorkshire (and at Shepperton Studios, of course), the moors look just as they do and as they should in Wuthering Heights - bleak, rocky, windswept, wild and unique. Southern California is not a great substitution for Yorkshire, whatever William Wyler may have thought (see his 1939 WH with Oberon and Oliver). Heathcliff: Timothy Dalton might almost be too pretty (this was filmed in 1971), he might tend to some overacting in certain scenes, but over all he evokes Bronte's character and in some ways, the ghost of Oliver, who was the best thing about the 1939 WH. The cast in general: There are not a lot of 'pretty faces' here, which is a good thing. Just very real, very characteristically English actors. No one is prettified just to sell tickets and it lends a nice authenticity to the production. Ditto for most of the accents. Yorkshire is not London, and the accents are, in reality, different. And for the most part the acting is decent. Miscellaneous: There is an very brief intimation between Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw in the opening scenes, that brings out a subtlety in Bronte's novel - that of Heathcliff's parentage. It lends an interesting accent to the rest of the proceedings, and I don't think any other version of WH has contained such a reference. Music: The music by Michel Legrand is for the most part appropriate and haunting. OK, now the cons. Truncating Bronte's novel is nothing new - Wyler did it in 1939, completely eliminating the 2nd generation and any mention of Cathy's pregnancy. But the deviations from the text - for anyone who loves the novel - are hard to swallow. Characters, who are supposed to continue living, are suddenly dead. Characters who die in the novel, end up living long after you think they are going to. Because this version of WH basically ends after Cathy's death, Heathcliff is not allowed to die the way he did in the novel (or even in the 1939 Hollywood version), as that would take too long. I had high hopes after the opening scenes, as they actually included Mrs. Earnshaw, which to my knowledge has never been done before, but alas, I was to be disappointed. The character of Cathy and the actress who plays her: I don't know what it is that the part of Heathcliff can draw good actors who do well in the part - Oliver, Dalton, Fiennes - and yet the actresses who play Cathy are so dismal and wrong for the part. Anna Calder-Marshall in this version is no exception. How shall I put this? For a good portion of the film she plays Cathy as slow-witted teenager, and for the rest of the film she is just kind of wacky and moony, not particularly wild or headstrong. I began to expect the entire movie to turn out to be one of those Afternoon Specials for teenagers, or something on Lifetime television for Women (Hell Hath no Fury Like a Wacky Woman-Child: The Catherine Earnshaw Story) She is not magnetic in any way - and for this quality, one need not be a beauty, only to possess a certain.....oh hell, 'je ne sais quoi' (ugh, did I just write that?). The actors who have played Heathcliff are admittedly handsome, but they have a certain charisma. Oberon was a beauty, Binoche is one too, but neither was right in the role, and neither is Ms. Calder-Marshall. It's a difficult part and the character is not particularly sympathetic or charming. Theme: This version of WH is probably the most sexed up version I have seen.  There is rolling around on the ground and even a reference to Cathy's baby (mentioned, but never shown or referred to again) possibly being Heathcliffs'.  Which pleases the romantics, I'm sure, but is not really what the relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff is all about. Wuthering Heights is not Romeo and Juliet, two crazy and impetuous kids, livin' large and dyin' young  The themes of the novel encompass much more than mere romance and sexuality. So, I am still looking forward to a great actress in the role of Catherine Earnshaw. And I am still looking forward to a great production of Wuthering Heights. I enjoy the 1939 version for it's Hollywood pretentions and Olivier, and because I am just sentimental about it.  The Fiennes-Binoche version has, like this version, good points and bad. Bunuel's Spanish version I give kudos too, but Mexico is not Yorkshire, and I'm sorry, I just like the moors.  The fairly recent PBS version wasn't bad, but I don't think it is out on VHS or DVD.

7906417,2,B00000F356,"Let me say up front that my wife is a big fan of the original movie version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS that starred Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier. I know shes watched it more than once and enjoyed it each time she has. Apparently all of those times were when I wasn't home because Ive yet to see that version. So this one, shot in 1970, is my first exposure to the story of Cathy and Heathcliff.

The Earnshaw family in England isn't the most posh of the lot but they are well off. One night the master of the house (Harry Andrews) returns home to Wuthering Heights with a young boy in tow. His wife eludes that this is an illegitimate son but he insists that the boy is merely an orphan he saved from the streets. The young boy, Heathcliff, grows up among the Earnshaw children, favored by young Cathy and with contempt by her brother Hindley.

The children grow up, Hindley (Julian Glover) goes off to school and Cathy and Heathcliff fall madly in love with one another. All of this is under the watchful eye of servant Nellie (Judy Cornwell). Things change when Mr. Earnshaw passes away. Hindley returns to take over things with a new wife in tow. Immediately he has Nellie and Heathcliff move out of the house to more suitable accommodations for their stature in life.

The bitterness between Heathcliff and Hindley continues. Cathy and Heathcliff prank the nearby Linton house, the end result being Cathy falling and injuring herself. The Lintons take her in and son Edgar immediately falls in love with her. Enjoying the attention Cathy gives back what she receives and provokes Heathcliff when she sees him next. In a rage he leaves all behind at sets out on his own.

Three years pass and Cathy has forgotten Heathcliff. Shes now married to Edgar. Hindley has lost his wife when she was giving birth and has fallen into being an alcoholic who is in the midst of gambling away Wuthering Heights. At this time Heathcliff chooses to return, polished and refined and no longer the dirty farm hand he appeared to be when he left.

Cathy and Heathcliff once again fall hopelessly in love and meet behind the scenes. She doesnt intend to leave Edgar though and Heathcliff, now more vengeful than romantic, begins to seduce Edgars sister Isabella. A pregnant Cathy seems to want her cake and eat it too remaining married and longing for her ex-love while he sets out to destroy those who thought themselves better than him.

I won't go on so as to not spoil the ending for those whove never seen it. Suffice to say that I wasn't thrilled with much of this movie. I found few characters to sympathize with, especially the two star crossed lovers at the center of it all. Both seem narcissistic as if all others should cater to them only. Their romance revolves around cheating on their respective spouses, of talking adoration for one another while doing as much mental harm to one another at the same time. Talk about confused.

The movie was made by AIP, American International Pictures, which was synonymous with drive in fare at the time. This was an attempt to make a more artistic costume drama on their part and it does look great. But the plotting is slow, the jumps in time unexplained and the overwrought emotions of characters off-putting. Fans of the story may enjoy it but my guess is most wont.

And yet Twilight Time has once more offered the film in pristine condition. Their presentation here in blu-ray format looks great. Would that the movie itself were as good as the efforts Twilight Time put into it. Extras include an isolated music track, an audio commentary track with film historian Justin Humphreys, the original theatrical trailer and writings by film historian Julie Kirgo. As with all Twilight Time releases this is limited to just 3,000 copies so if you're a fan then make sure you buy your copy as soon as possible.",1517270400,,3845,4.63582966226138
7906418,5,B00000F356,"I really enjoyed this film as I enjoy all Wuthering Height's film's...I first rented it on video (when they used to have video stores) it wasn't in the best of shape but it was good enough to know that hey I really liked this! Anna Calder-Marshall and Timothy Dalton are just wonderful! It is heartbreaking because you want so much for them to be together...it's like you don't even care so much that it doesn't cover the next generation..because I really think that this is just covering,trying to focus on the main love story which is in the first half of the book and it is a very extremely romantic film...I have found myself wondering though..That I do sometimes wonder what it would have been like with the second half of the book?",1513641600,,737,4.548872180451128
7906419,5,B00000F356,"Of all the versions of Wuthering Heights this is truest to the spirit of Emily Bronte's intent to immortalize her brother Branwell. Timothy Dalton is spot on as the the darkly handsome, brooding Heathcliff. While the story change in the end will most likely irritate fans of the novel and Calder Marshall's petulant Cathy is a bit annoying,  Dalton so brilliantly captures the essence of Heathcliff, that he literally takes your breath away.",1499558400,,441,5.041095890410959
7906420,5,B00000F356,"I know a lot of people would disagree, but this is my favorite version of Wuthering Heights. Timothy Dalton has the perfect look for Heathcliff. I watched the one with Sir Laurence Olivier - he didn't have a wild bone in his body and as good an actor as he was, he couldn't imitate it. Timothy Dalton IS Heathcliff. Do yourself a favor and give this one a watch. (I got the Cliff Notes version because that was the only one available at the time.)",1496275200,2,447,4.270588235294118
