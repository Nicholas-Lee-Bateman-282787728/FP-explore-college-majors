700204,5,6303686761,"The screen time may belong to Woody Allen, but the movie belongs to Zero Mostel. Few actors are more improbable than the artfully bulky Mostel, whose round head, tiny snub nose and large expressive eyes resemble a cartoon more than an actual person. Yet his range is phenomenal. Watch the breadth as he slyly tries to work around head witch-hunter Francis Hennesee, or comically greets the diminutive Allen, or  explodes in eye-popping  rage at the Borscht-belt proprietor who cheats him. His metaphorical loss in the film mirrors the very real loss film-goers suffered during his years of blacklist. And it's to Allen's credit that he generously showcases this prodigious talent in what would be Mostel's last film.
The movie itself handles the blacklist of the 1950's with a congenial light touch. Allen is perfect as the nebbish who fronts for his screenwriter pals, and it's fun to watch him puff up and fluff out as the spotlight shifts abruptly his way. As expected, there are many amusing Allen bits scattered throughout. Even the romantic angle with Marcovicci works nicely into Allen's character as he evolves through the story-line, ending in a perceptive example of the old ""worm turns"" plot twist. All in all, this 1976, Martin Ritt film amounts to an amusing look at a dark period in American civil liberties, made unusually memorable by the sublime presence of the unforgettable Zero Mostel.",1073174400,5,1405,5.0257510729613735
700205,5,6303686761,"Soon after the release of his hilarious 1975 film, ""Love and Death,"" Woody Allen did something he rarely does...

...he starred in a movie -- that he didn't write nor direct.

Back in the mid-1970s, the idea of slapstick actor Woody Allen -- crossing into ""serious"" territory and coming out heroic -- was unfathomable.

Yet when ""The Front"" came out in 1976, its ad campaign blared, ""America's Most Unlikely Hero.""  I couldn't shake off Allen's image as a prankster, the same foolish nerd who's vividly on display in his early, fall-down-funny films.

But when I saw Allen in ""The Front,"" directed by the late Martin Ritt, it marked the beginning of my ""conversion"" -- from an on-the-fence ""observer"" -- into a full-fledged, Woody Allen fan.

""The Front"" feels like it's all Woody Allen -- because it has a comedic flair with which we're familiar in all of his films.  But former blacklisted writer Walter Bernstein -- not Woody Allen -- wrote the script for ""The Front.""

The film is about a serious part of American history.  Allen is a cashier and a part-time bookie -- who shoots to super stardom as a ""front"" for blacklisted television writers who are Communist sympathizers.  His built-in persona as a clumsy and intellectual nerd -- vested into a heartfelt character who feels tremendous loyalty and affection for his friends -- is a wonderment.  And in 1976, for the first time -- we got to see humanity and horror reflected in a starkly emotional face -- that Allen himself rarely reveals -- when he's an actor in his own films.

When this ""PG-rated"" picture came out more than 30 years ago, I was shocked by its ending.  In 1976, you couldn't end a film like ""The Front"" without getting slapped with an ""R"" rating.  During the 1970s, only one other American film containing a specific profane expression -- ""All the President's Men"" -- also released in 1976 -- escaped with a ""PG"" rating, with the Motion Picture Association of America citing ""historical"" considerations.  That same reasoning must have also applied to ""The Front.""

Today, the ending of ""The Front"" seems tame, but it was a revelation during the 1970s.  Years later, I look back at ""The Front,"" a film missed by many, as a ""turning point"" for Woody's career -- a launching pad for the sparkling and serious work Allen himself churned out as a writer and director from 1977 to 1989 -- a stellar period, creatively speaking, that in my view, he's unlikely to top again.  And I can't help but think that ""The Front,"" which was released before ""Annie Hall"" in 1977, played some role in Allen's decision to shift gears forever, writing more films with important themes, yet still stamped with his special brand of humor.

The late Zero Mostel and the luminous Andrea Marcovicci are also fabulous.  Mostel was a well-known performer in 1976, hence his polish as an actor shines through.  The bigger surprise is Marcovicci.  One wonders what kind of film career she could've had -- had she been offered better parts.  She's camera-ready radiant and her acting is note perfect in ""The Front.""  (Fortunately, in real life, she got the last laugh, going on to a spectacular career as a cabaret singer in New York.)

I just watched ""The Front"" again and it still holds up well.  Superficially it feels comic, but the undercurrent of tragedy is present.  After a horrific plot twist takes center stage, Woody's transformation is complete.  His status as a ""front"" for blacklisted writers becomes more than just about having money and friends.  Just before his character has to testify in front of a Congressional committee about Communists in the entertainment industry, he vows to Andrea Marcovicci that he'll NEVER go back to his old life as a cashier.  But he doesn't tell her how.  In fact, we as an audience -- don't know how Allen's character will achieve this goal -- until he utters the last line in the picture.

Untypically (for Woody Allen) -- that line -- is a crowd pleaser.  But everything feels earned.  (Frank Sinatra sings ""Young at Heart"" under the opening AND closing credits.)  In sum, ""The Front"" is a hidden gem more people should see.",1006214400,51,4122,4.782178217821782
700206,3,6303686761,"the Woodman speaks up for those of his buddies in his early show biz days who were caught 'red-handed' betraying their friends, family, and community to Joseph Stalin, a psychopathic mass murderer who killed tens of millions of his own countrymen.

having successfully turned eastern europe into a Stalinist hell in the post WWII years, the 'usual suspects' {chuckling}, through the CPUSA (Communist Party USA) and various other front groups, attempted to turn western europe and the u.s. into similar Stalinist hells.

post-glasnot, even the successor to the KGB admits that the CPUSA was owned lock, stock, and barrel by soviet intelligence, from the day of its founding in 1917.

the fallback defense -- now that even the venerable NY Times (at long last) concedes all of this, is along the lines of, ""hey, dude, don't have a cow -- it's *not* as if they *succeeded* in turning the u.s. into a Stalinist hell!""

well, no, they didn't -- because they were stopped from doing so. needless to say, they have never forgiven us for exposing their perfidy to public scrutiny.

""name, names of my friends? -- no way!"" says Woody's otherwise completely innocent character. he chooses jail instead (a scenario that *never once* happened in real life).

oh, btw, everyone knows show business people would sell their grandmother's eyeballs to the blind mullah just to get a speaking part in a movie. but, betray Stalin? no way!!!

of course, if they had been working-class, high-school dropouts with names that ended in vowels, no one would have been the least bit fooled that there was something noble about 'omerta'. (or would they? {sigh.})

anyway, the best thing about The Front is, of course, Andrea Marcovicci, who is, imo, the most underrated love goddess of her generation. so she plays a communist fellow traveler -- with lips like hers, who cares? hey, like the Joe E. Brown character said with a big grin at the end of Some Like It Hot, ""nobody's perfect!""",1003881600,10,1960,4.882530120481928
700207,5,6303686761,"An exceptional expose on the absurdity of the Hollywood Blacklist.  Allen is a restaurant cashier asked by a former high school chum to ""front"" as a writer so this gentleman can continue to write and get paid.  It works so well, two more blacklist writers are added.  It's funny to watch unassuming Allen develop an ego as he takes on the persona of an actual writer.  In addition, there is a love interest which questions whether this love would grow if he were still a cashier.
The second half of this movie really builds around the conflicts involved with whether to testify and ""name names"".  The absurdity is so evident when Allen is forced to testify to escape punishment if he will ""out"" a purported communist who has just committed suicide.  Zero Mostel also has a great role as an actor trying to get work.
I strongly recommend this movie to challenge your beliefs about the blacklist.  Also, make sure and stay for the credits to see the many involved who were blacklisted but were able to work on this movie.  An exceptionally entertaining and educational movie.",979257600,39,1073,4.7005347593582885

700398,4,6303686761,"I am proud to declare that I have seen (or thought that I have seen) every movie Woody Allen has been associated with, either as a writer, director or a star, very often all of the above. To my surprise, I realized just recently that I missed ""The Front"", very dark, rather tragic political dramedy about shameful part of the American history, the McCarthy-era Communist witch hunts with the blacklists that affected deeply lives of many Hollywood filmmakers, performers and writers.  Creators of the film, director  Martin Ritt; writer Walter Bernstein; and actors Zero Mostel, Herschel Bernardi, Lloyd Gough and Joshua Shelley knew about McCarthy-era from their own experiences. They were all blacklisers. Woody Allen who did not participate in directing  ""The Front"" or writing the script delivers  realistic and sympathetic  performance as Howard, a small apolitical guy, rather a loser who wanted to help his friend, a blacklisted writer, by providing the front for the TV scripts with a little profit for himself to cover his own many debts. While doing so (and helping two more blacklisted writers), Howard soon realized how horrible, unfair and anti-human the blacklist situation was and he wanted to do something about it.

By reluctant pretending to be a writer, he becomes a popular and sought-after figure among the TV producers and actors and makes friends with the  beloved  TV comedian Hecky Brown (Zero Mostel) who was blacklisted because of the marching during the May Day parade in his youth many years ago. Howard witnesses firsthand the spiral fall of the man who lost everything he lived for because he was not allowed to do the very thing he was born to do - to perform on public, to entertain, to make people laugh.  If nothing else, ""The Front"" introduced me to Zero Mostel, the very symbol of great comedian and the victim of the witch hunts in the 1950. Mostel effortlessly steals every moment he is in, and his last scene could make a stone weep.

If you are prepared for a comedy, The Front is most certainly not a regular one even though it's got quite a few jokes, the majority of which had to do with Howard (Allen) repeating that he was not a writer and could not even write a grocery list. Coming from a man whose next film would be ""Annie Hall""  that brought him two Oscars for writing and directing and who has received numerous awards and nominations for his work during several decades, especially, for screenwriting, makes it for an excellent joke.

The film belongs to its time by giving  very personal and honest account on what it was like to be on the notorious blacklist but it works fine for today audiences as well. It's been over 60 years since the dark times of the blacklists, the hunt for the dissenters, for those whose  opinions, beliefs, preferences were different from the generally accepted but we all should know about the gross injustice that resulted in many broken lives and never let the dark era of paranoia, abuse of power, and hypocrisy prevail again.",1463097600,,3013,4.802707930367505

700532,5,6303686761,"I think the best compliment that can be paid to director Martin Ritt's forty year old film about the blacklist that persisted in the entertainment industry in the Fifties is that the message still resonates today.  Consider the rhetoric and hyperbole that is being bandied about regarding the terror threat from radical Islam not making distinctions with peaceful and hostile Muslims.  Soviet communism was a legitimate threat in our postwar environment but not the brand associated with artistic types of the time.  We  find ourselves vilifying each other over membership in a mainstream political party which is a danger unto itself.  Enough soapbox.  The selling points of this film is the turn by Woody Allen playing a sad sack who experiences riches and fame fronting for blacklisted scriptwriters whose character evolves when he discovers the dangers of redbaiting. Allen's casting is a stroke of genius and he expertly blurs the line between comic and dramatic.  Equally fine is Zero Mostel as an entertainer whose misguided dalliance with an attractive Communist years before leading to his professional ruination.  Mostel wrings all the pathos from the character that you'll find yourself laughing  between the tears. Standout scene is one where Mostel angrily confronts a Catskills resort owner for paying him peanuts for a gig he once commanded top dollar for.  I love Ritt's ironic use of Frank Sinatra's ""Young at Heart"" as documentary footage of families piling into bomb shelters and disabled returning vets is shown over the opening credits.

700745,4,6303686761,"A classic film about a dark time in America's history, ""The Front"" arrives on Blu-ray in a very nice looking transfer from Twilight Time. You can obtain a copy at the Screen Archives website ( limited to 3000 copies)as well as here.

Howard Prince (Woody Allen) becomes a writer by proxy when he agrees to front for black listed TV writer Alfred Miller (Michael Murphy). When Howard gets a taste of the finer things, he asks Alfred if he can front for any other writers accused of being communists. Along the way Howard discovers he has a conscience as those around him fall victim to ""the committee"".

Featuring terrific performances from the late Zero Mostel,the late Herschel Bernardi (both black listed) and Andrea Marcovicci in supporting roles, ""The Front"" has been largely forgotten (unfortunately) as it's a fine movie with an Oscar nominated screenplay by Walter Bernstein (blacklisted)that balances moments of comedy with dramatic desperation. Director Martin Ritt does a nice job of recreating the era.

The only flaws in the film are the under development of a couple of secondary characters and the rather abrupt conclusion of the film.

The Blu-ray transfer looks very nice. The film looks remarkably sharp complimenting the photography by Michael Chapman but be prepared as it has the rather gritty, grainy look of films from the 1970's. There are a couple of stray shots that are noticeably soft but these are fleeting.

The mono soundtrack sounds quite nice with surprising depth.

The special features are quite nice as well. We get a commentary track featuring Andrea Marcovicci, Julie Kirgo and Nick Redman that's quite informative. Dave Grusin's score also receives a isolated track although there are long gaps of silence. We also get the original theatrical trailer for the film. Julie Kirgo provides an essay in the booklet included with the film.

700746,5,6303686761,"The McCarthy-inspired Blacklist in the late 40s and 50s is such a shameful incident in America's history that film and TV has largely steered clear of the subject altogether: you can count the films dealing with it directly on the fingers of one hand, so it sounds like damning with faint praise to say that the rarely revived The Front is the best of them all. That it's the `Woody Allen film' that time forgot hasn't helped it's reputation, but in truth, although many regular Allen collaborators from co-star Michael Murphy to producers Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe are involved, this isn't an Allen film: some of the wisecracks may be tailor-made for him, but this is Martin Ritt and Walter Bernstein's film and Allen's just playing a role, that of a cashier and small-time bookie who finds himself `fronting' for blacklisted writers for 10% of whatever they get for their scripts.

Kicking off with a superb scene-setting montage of the 50s at its best and worst, from baseball and apple pie to the Korean War and the execution of the Rosenbergs while Frank Sinatra sings Young at Heart on the soundtrack, it's a film that certainly speaks from personal experience. Along with writer Walter Bernstein and director Martin Ritt (who had both touched upon the blacklist more obliquely in 1970's The Molly Maguires) many of the cast - Zero Mostel, Herschel Bernardi, Lloyd Gough, Joshua Shelley - were blacklisted, while the daughter of one of the blacklist's most tragic victims, John Garfield, also appears. Yet surprisingly it's not a whitewash: the blacklisted writers make it clear that they weren't put on the list by mistake but because they are communists, while Allen's front may start out on his new career as a favor to a friend but quickly shows his true opportunistic colors. No sooner has he seen how much money he can make than he's taking on more writers at higher rates, seducing Andrea Marcovicci's production assistant who is really in love with the words that aren't even his own rather than the man himself and getting ideas above his station, refusing to hand in scripts he thinks aren't up to his standards because ""It's my name that goes on the script."" In that he's really no different from anyone else in a world where club owners take advantage of the blacklist to get performers like Mostel's increasingly suicidal Hecky Green at bargain rates and then still knock them down even further after a sell-out show. But it's not long before he becomes a political suspect himself...

Set in the fledgling TV industry where gas company sponsors insisted on rewriting concentration camp dramas to avoid giving their product a bad image and where businessmen who only owned a couple of stores could demand - and get - the right of veto over any cast members they thought are `too red' for their customers' liking by threatening to withdraw a single commercial (both true incidents), it doesn't really need to resort to comic invention, but it's more of an absurd yet dry black comedy that's often too dark NOT to laugh at. The final scene where Allen comes up against the committee and tries to bluff his way out of a contempt charge is really just a piece of wish fulfilment, the kind of thing you wish you had said long after the moment has passed, but it's hard to begrudge Ritt and Bernstein their moment: they earned it. Running a tight hour-and-a-half and with great photography by Michael Chapman, it's well worth investigating.

While Sony's DVD release offered no extras, Twilight Time's Bluray release more than makes amends with an audio commentary featuring co-star Andrea Marcovicci, isolated score (the Sinatra song is not included on that track, though it remains on the film proper), trailer and booklet, as well as featuring a solid widescreen transfer.",1392940800,3,3796,4.854938271604938

700749,5,6303686761,"Being a lifelong afficionado of classic movies, I'm not sure how I managed to overlook this little gem. ""The Front"" is a disturbing look at the Hollywood blacklist of the 1950's. The filmmakers don't waste time with excessive plot lines and the dramatic ending feeds back into events that took place in the opening minutes of the movie.

This is a good movie to introduce young people to events of fairly recent history. Actually, that's where I saw this movie, in a history class, and it was a most excellent choice for bringing historical events to life for those of us who weren't even alive when this movie was released, back in 1976.

Actor Zero Mostel offers a heartbreaking performance as Hecky Brown, the funny guy, a comedian who all of a sudden can't even get a decent booking out of town, because he's been labeled as a Communist sympathizer. It's impossible to walk away from this movie without absolutely falling in love with this guy. Knowing a little something about American history, I figured out early on in the movie how Hecky's story would end, but it was still a great cinematic moment.",1378512000,,1107,4.701030927835052

700846,5,6303686761,"Woody Allen's ""dramatic debut""  in Martin Ritt's THE FRONT was considered by many critics to be a real a disappointment.  He--and Ritt--took a fair amount of flak for having Woody play Woody,  essentially.  There were dramatic turns aplenty in the film,  but Woody was wisecracking and nebbishing his way through them in his characteristic style and leaving the emoting up to others (and plainly writing--or AD LIBBING--much of his own dialogue).  The movie's dramatic heft, they opined,  was supplied by its McCarthy era backdrop and related plotline.  But if Zero Mostel's blacklisted comic was truly a tragic figure,  Woody as the ""front"" of the title,  was  jarringly inconsistent.

Well, that was then.  I'd say this 1976 film has aged quite well.  In many ways the film fits right in with everything  that  Woody Allen has done in a more ""dramatic"" vein ever since.  THE FRONT was actually one year prior to Allen's own first real artistic triumph,  ANNIE HALL,  which successful ly blended dramatic elements into the sophisticated comedy.  Since that time,  he's consistently mixed comic elements into his dramatic works and,  of course, vice versa.  It's become something of a trademark,  in fact,  and some 36 years after the release of his ""dramatic (acting) debut,""  it make a bit more sense than it did to some viewers in 1976.

In fact,  while THE FRONT is not the first film to deal with the McCarthy era or with blacklisting in specific,  it may well be the case that even a quarter of a century after the fact,  wounds were still raw among those who'd survived the blacklist and they may have had trouble relating to the film's comic elements--or perhaps even its relative smallness of scale.  THE FRONT is not the sweeping statement that some may have hoped for.  I'm sure some expected a scathing indictment of the times and of the paranoia and downright exploitative villainy so many exhibited during the era.  You get some of that,  of course.  You also get a touching reminder of the human cost it all entailed in Zero Mostel's remarkable performance as the doomed comedian.

But the reluctant heroism that the smalltime hustler  Woody Allen embodies is also quite touching too.  Is it predictable that this opportunist whose willingness to ""front"" for blacklisted writers has brought him considerable fame and fortune would have a change of heart and tell HUAC what they could do with their line of inquiry.  Of course,  but it's a delicious moment all the same.

1976 was a pretty good year for movies:  TAXI DRIVER, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN,  NETWORK,  MARATHON MAN, ROCKY (which seemed pretty fresh and new at the time),  Hitchcock's swan song FAMILY PLOT.  I don't recall THE FRONT making that many critics' 10 Best list.  Perhaps it deserves a re-look.",1356220800,,2778,4.875268817204301

700850,4,6303686761,"The Front, 1987 film

The story begins with newsreels from the early 1950s. We see the wedding of Senator Joseph McCarthy! Next B-29s dropping bombs, then other movie news films from that era. You will remember them if you are over 65 years. Alfred Miller, a big TV write, visits his friend. Howard places a bet in a bar. Miller is blacklisted, he can't find work as he is a ""communist sympathizer"" (a vague term). Miller wants a ""real person"" as a front for his stories. He offers ""10%"" to Howard for this. Howard needs money to pay for his gambling losses. His brother gives him the money and warns him against his losses. Howard's script is accepted, its ""first class"". We see the management of a TV show, they are just employees of the network corporation. The owners of a blacklisting business interview Hecky Brown about his past activities. Was he duped? He is only an actor who does as he is told. [Just like the announcers on radio and TV.]

We see a TV show on Studio One-two. Howard takes a girl to lunch (she is involved with a stockbroker). A writer needs experience from life. Howard writes well about women. Howard still needs money. Can he front for other writers? One writer tells the purpose of the blacklist"" it stifles political protest. They discuss the problems of taxes, and how tax returns are used. Actors are rejected as ""not right for the part"". [Is this like age discrimination?] Howard is told to ""keep walking"" as he meets a writer on the street who is under surveillance by the FBI. The TV producer needs a fast rewrite to avoid mentioning the phrase ""gas chamber""! Howard calls his source from a telephone booth. Howard gets publicity. Is this too much? Hecky Brown offers to cooperate to get work. Can he get close to Howard Prince and learn more about him? Howard is shocked to learn girlfriend Florence quit her job! Does she know what is in her best interest? [Decisions made by emotions are seldom the best.]

Hecky becoms friendly with Howard. [Does he ask too many questions? Is this the sign of an agent?] Show business is still business. Howard learned from experience, that is why he never wrote earlier. Hecky gets emotional and is fired again (by a friend). Hecky uses his opportunity to snoop into Howard's papers! An advertiser talks to a TV producer about the actors he employs. [Is this different from the influence of advertisers on newspapers?] Howard has picked up a tail. Howard pays by check (!), not untraceable cash. Howard visits a book store to see Florence. They broke off their relationship. Howard gets a subpoena to testify before a Congressional Committee. Can one person say ""No"" to upset things? [No.] Phil makes a phone call, but Howard must go. He is questioned about Miller and his friends Delaney and Phelps. [Note the diplomatic smoothness of the corporate lawyer.] Will Howard be a ""friendly witness""? Howard explains his plans. Is it fixed? [The use of cream was then a treatment for stomach ulcers. In Europe they used sauerkraut juice (acid with vitamin C).]

Hecky comes for a visit and questions him. ""The water is full of sharks."" Hecky checks into a hotel room and opens a window. A man photographs a funeral. Howard visits Florence and talks about his activities. She is surprised. Howard plans to beat the Committee. [Is that possible for him?] They question Howard but he doesn't answer directly or cooperate. Can Howard be nailed by the Committee? He plays stupid, but admits to placing bets. ""Be practical"" says his lawyer. But Howard makes a dramatic exit. Later a handcuffed Howard is led away. People carry sings in protest.

The credits list a number of people, some were blacklisted in the early 1950s (but survived). The blacklist was a tool to threaten people who questioned the Cold War and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Widespread atomic bombing would create a ""nuclear winter"" (like an epidemic of volcano eruptions) that would create Global Cooling from the resultant dust storms. Many people and animals would be killed from the loss of vegetation (less sunlight) and nuclear radiation. It would create a new Ice Age or a Dark Age from the loss of sunlight. There would be darkness at noon. This movie is another form of revising history.",1353196800,2,4240,4.755434782608695

701014,5,6303686761,"The various blanket infringements on the rights of American citizens and others since the criminal events of 9/11 hardly represent the first time that the American government has seen fit to curtail those rights. The Palmer Raids roundup of reds, radicals and foreigners in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution at the tail end of World War I comes to mind. As done the subject of this film, the red scare against communist and other labor radicals after World War II with the onset of the Cold War against the Soviet Union, a former ally. The name of this period narrowly is given in the history books as the McCarthy witch-hunt era, although that hardly dose justice to the widespread political paranoia, high and low, in America at that time. The signature event was the execution of the Rosenbergs, Julius and Ethel, for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. As this film points out as it unfolds that  political perfect storm dragged in and ruined many  people from many fields, probably none more publicized than in the entertainment industry especially film and the emerging television medium.

Woody Allen has performed many roles over the year from nerdy romantic lead to nerdy neurotic New York intellectual and social commentator but this is one of the few roles of his where the subject matter is more than just fodder for his sardonic writing or comedic talents. The story line here is rather simple, if the politics are rather more complex. Woody, a bright but underachieving New York bar cashier Howard Prince, as a favor (and to get some much needed cash as well) to his blacklisted lefty childhood television writer friend (played by Michael Murphy) agrees to ""front"" for him. This means that said friend does the writing and Woody gets the credit, the cash and off-handedly as is the case with many commercial productions the girl. In short order Woody gets to like the notoriety and the new lifestyle and agrees to front for other blacklisted writers. Then the real trouble starts.

During the early 1950's it was not enough to write sanitary material for the mass media (approved by outsiders with their own agendas), it was not enough to apologize to various Congressional committees and their cohorts for youthful, innocent and, frankly, acceptable leftist political beliefs in order to survive in the entertainment industry (the subject here but it could have been in the trade unions, education, governmental service or almost any other facet of American life at the time). One had to grovel and name names. And the bulk of those who were called before the committees or faced other types of pressure did do, with regret, with relish or with indifference. But they did it.

There is an incredibly poignant sub theme that runs throughout this film that details the pressures in the career-shattering of one of the ""recanters"", Hecky Brown (masterfully played by Zero Mostel, blacklisted in the 1950's himself as was the director Martin Ritt and some of the others involved in this production), who in the end gives up Woody to the committees- finks on him, in other words. However filled with remorse Hecky commits suicide. That was not common to be sure. Hell, those were desperate times and not everyone has the courage to say no. Woody's character, in the convoluted, Allen way does just that. Just says no. And pays the consequences. So in the end there were choices. For every Elia Kazan, Elizabeth Bentley and the like there was a Howard Fast, a Dashiell Hammett and the like who said no.  As some recently released information has indicated the Rosenbergs paid the ultimate price for their refusal to name names. That, in the end, is what this film is all about and that is what should be honored.",1225152000,3,3735,4.855572998430142
701015,5,6303686761,"The McCarthy-inspired Blacklist in the late 40s and 50s is such a shameful incident in America's history that film and TV has largely steered clear of the subject altogether: you can count the films dealing with it directly on the fingers of one hand, so it sounds like damning with faint praise to say that the rarely revived The Front is the best of them all. That it's the `Woody Allen film' that time forgot hasn't helped it's reputation, but in truth, although many regular Allen collaborators from co-star Michael Murphy to producers Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe are involved, this isn't an Allen film: some of the wisecracks may be tailor-made for him, but this is Martin Ritt and Walter Bernstein's film and Allen's just playing a role, that of a cashier and small-time bookie who finds himself `fronting' for blacklisted writers for 10% of whatever they get for their scripts.

Kicking off with a superb scene-setting montage of the 50s at its best and worst, from baseball and apple pie to the Korean War and the execution of the Rosenbergs while Frank Sinatra sings Young at Heart on the soundtrack, it's a film that certainly speaks from personal experience. Along with writer Walter Bernstein and director Martin Ritt (who had both touched upon the blacklist more obliquely in 1970's The Molly Maguires) many of the cast - Zero Mostel, Herschel Bernardi, Lloyd Gough, Joshua Shelley - were blacklisted, while the daughter of one of the blacklist's most tragic victims, John Garfield, also appears. Yet surprisingly it's not a whitewash: the blacklisted writers make it clear that they weren't put on the list by mistake but because they are communists, while Allen's front may start out on his new career as a favor to a friend but quickly shows his true opportunistic colors. No sooner has he seen how much money he can make than he's taking on more writers at higher rates, seducing Andrea Marcovicci's production assistant who is really in love with the words that aren't even his own rather than the man himself and getting ideas above his station, refusing to hand in scripts he thinks aren't up to his standards because ""It's my name that goes on the script."" In that he's really no different from anyone else in a world where club owners take advantage of the blacklist to get performers like Mostel's increasingly suicidal Hecky Green at bargain rates and then still knock them down even further after a sell-out show. But it's not long before he becomes a political suspect himself...

Set in the fledgling TV industry where gas company sponsors insisted on rewriting concentration camp dramas to avoid giving their product a bad image and where businessmen who only owned a couple of stores could demand - and get - the right of veto over any cast members they thought are `too red' for their customers' liking by threatening to withdraw a single commercial (both true incidents), it doesn't really need to resort to comic invention, but it's more of an absurd yet dry black comedy that's often too dark NOT to laugh at. The final scene where Allen comes up against the committee and tries to bluff his way out of a contempt charge is really just a piece of wish fulfilment, the kind of thing you wish you had said long after the moment has passed, but it's hard to begrudge Ritt and Bernstein their moment: they earned it. Running a tight hour-and-a-half and with great photography by Michael Chapman, it's well worth investigating.",1194912000,5,3461,4.805369127516778
701016,5,6303686761,"THE FRONT, starring Woody Allen, Michael Murphy and Zero Mostel, is an engaging, brilliant, well-written piece that examines the plight of Blacklisted writers and other creative artists who were stifled and forbidden during the age of McCarthyism and the Witch Hunt.

There were numerous eloquent, intelligent and insightful people who were made ""invisible"" under the clause of this regimented attempt to stamp out those who were politically subversive.

Howard Prince (Allen) is a meak cashier who poses as a Blacklisted writer (Murphy) secretly passing on his work and acting as ghostwriter in a series of pieces that earn him critical acclaim.  Though, this response proves quite seductive for Prince, who pockets the money to pay off gambling debts, he becomes aware of the great wrong and injustice being done to those targetted as subversives, and Howard feels he must take a stand.

In the times of the Red Scare, when Sen. McCarthy was hunting down real and/or supposed Communist ""infiltrators,"" those in Hollywood who had Socialist or Communist affiliations were blacklisted and unable to work. Some found others, Fronts, whose past wasn't deemed treasonouos, to put their names on scripts-as I realize now, only writers could do this-and turn the paycheck over to the real writer, for a fee.

Such is the case for Woody in this. But it is a refreshing Allen here, with a minimum of his patented neurotic persona, and some real acting. While funny and witty, the film is also menacing. We see the interrogations levelled on the accused by PI-type investigators, and the according concessions made by desperate people to compromise themselves.

701193,5,6303686761,"I had to see this movie because my real life was based on the idea that this kind of excitement is usually reserved for the experiences that money can't buy.  I was surprised when the Secret Service was interested in having me sign a release to allow appropriate authorities to examine a photocopy of my 1989-1999 psychiatric files to determine if I needed to be on a list of dangerous persons that the government would be trying to prevent from flying or entering special safe zones for politicians who would like to stay far away from crazy people who could totally blow their cool.  Since politics lately is like the idea that a Vietnam war hero is most likely to be treated like the oxymoron it always had the potential to become, I could even complain that this movie did not come close to the issues which make the current situation more like the movie `Fahrenheit 9/11.'  But the people who made this movie knew what they were doing to protect their right to say whatever they wanted to say.

That Woody Allen and Zero Mostel managed to make a serious movie, `The Front,' which is based on the experiences of the blacklisted writers, actors, and the director that could give meaning to ideas like taking the fifth and naming names, still seems important, even though official investigation of subversive activities in the entertainment industry is hardly what it used to be.  In the field of philosophy, Martin Heidegger retains a bad reputation among some people for terminating certain academic careers by calling certain people un-German or Jewish when that was his job and what his Fuhrer wanted, so some highly educated people are more sensitive to this kind of issue than others.  Woody Allen has the ideal character from a modern American standpoint, able to play complete apathy, concerned that anyone should be in trouble, but hardly prone to accept the network's advice, `Name Hecky Brown.  He's dead.'  Sometimes death is more than just nature's way of telling certain people to slow down, and being an expert in this kind of death is not as comic as we keep pretending.  In another context, Woody Allen said, `Intellectuals are like the mafia; they only kill their own.'  This is one of the truer things he ever said, possibly the truest in my case.  This film is like a layer of history in the crusade against godless Communism that the United States of America went through in the 1950's to get to the position it is in today, which is a different crusade in which comedy can hardly be faulted for failing to keep up with what is going on in reality.

Zero Mostel pretending to be a spy, knocking on a door saying, `Open up, this is the police!' is also the kind of behavior I observe in neighbors who are trying to participate in my form of paranoia.  Anyone who has ever been to Harvard Law School should have some way to keep from sympathizing too much with the character that Zero Mostel plays in this movie, but I should save my sympathy for other people who already spent all the money they ever had.  If comedy were an art form, I still wouldn't be funny, and that is what really hurts me, but this DVD is great either way.",1093737600,,3151,4.593582887700535
701194,5,6303686761,"A cashier and small-time bookie (Woody Allen) agrees to front for black-listed writers (Michael Murphy, Remak Ramsey, Marvin Lichterman) in 1950s network TV, passing off their work as his own and keeping 10% of the fee.  He becomes comfortable and enjoys his new fame, but his delight at living the good life and dating a beautiful script editor (Andrea Marcovicci) gradually wanes in the face of the seriousness of the McCarthy era blacklist, the coercive tactics of the federal government, and its devastating effect on the lives of people in show business.

This is one of Allen's rare appearances in a film that he did not write and direct.  He has chosen his material well.  Director Martin Ritt and screenwriter Walter Bernstein, both blacklisted themselves, have crafted a marvelously entertaining and funny film that also dramatizes the tragedy of the blacklist.  Allen makes the material his own so that it often seems as if he has written his own dialogue.  Zero Mostel delivers a great performance as the blacklisted comedian Hecky Brown.",1092787200,5,1049,5.069767441860465
701195,4,6303686761,"I suppose first up, given some of the comments here, that it's worthwhile acknowledging that communism was a threat to the United States and the West in the 1950s, and that the CPUSA played a subversive role in supporting the foreign policy interests of the Soviet Union. How culpable were the one-time communist sympathisers in Hollywood is another matter entirely, however, and the crudity and narrow-mindedness of McCarthy was unworthy of a democratic nation.
That the real danger of Soviet-style communism (both to the Americanist flagwavers and the progressive liberals and workers who understandably despised both the right and the CPUSA left) doesn't come across in this film is perhaps understandable: the personal hurt felt by all those who made it may over-ride their own sense of complicity. Unfortunate, but there you are.  And it is a comedy.
As for the film itself, Allen is brilliant as Howard Prince, although once again, he seems to be playing Woody. The real star, however, is Mostel, whose bravura performance throughout puts you through the wringer with him.
The ending is ambiguous - his testimony before HUAC is supposedly carefully planned by him (without his counsel's knowledge), but instead Woody playing Woody (ie. with all the nervous tics and unfinished, stuttering sentences) gives the perhaps misleading impression that he's floundering, and therefore can leave viewers wondering whether his rebuke to the system was a political statement or merely a desperate outburst from one who was outwitted by a group of professionals.
Nevertheless, the film is v. enjoyable.",1083369600,5,1596,5.283464566929134
701196,5,6303686761,"It is always interesting to watch an old movie about an older time. This 1976 examination of the McCarthy-era serves a couple of purposes. At a time when the cold war was focusing on East Asia, the time was right for a re-examation of the excesses of the 50s lest they fade from memory (something that still applies to today). We start off during the opening credits with newsreel scenes from 1952: Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, frontlines from the Korean War, Marilyn Monroe getting her star on Hollywood Blvd, the Rosenbergs being carted off to their execution, new cars, new homes complete with bomb shelters, etc. But the movie focusus on the blacklisitng of writers, directors, and actors in entertainment; specifically at NBC television. The details and the methodology of the blacklist are exact and don't involve a lot of exposition. Halfway through the film, you get a fairly complete picture of how the blacklist worked.
The movie is also a good old-fashioned ""Screw You!"". The film was written by a blacklisted writer (who is obviously drawing from his own experience), directed by a blacklisted director and is populated (not exclusively) by blacklisted actors. The actors who were blacklisted get their own titles in the closing credits.
And thirdly, (and most importantly) the movie is good entertainment. Amateur bookie Harold Prince, described by his brother as ""a lowlife bum"", cares about two things: making money with as little effort as possible and getting laid. He has no apparent talent and no political convictions. Prince's lifelong buddy Al Miller (played by Mike ""Jack Tanner"" Murphy) has problems of his own: despite award-winning work, he can't get a job writing because word is out that he marched in a May Day parade. Al makes a proposition. He writes the stuff, Harold submits it, and Harold gets to keep 10% of the money.
By his own admission, Harold knows nothing and cares nothing about politics or the blacklist. (""Why don't you just sue someone?"" he asks). But he doesn't protest: this is easy money, he takes it. When it works, he takes on more writers and finds himself getting both more easy money and more tail than he would have imagined; but as he starts to realize some of the bigger issues at stake, he very slowly (VERY slowly) starts developing a conscience.
The humor comes from Prince, trying horribly to fake being a writer. The producers of the TV shows he writes for love him because he doesn't act like a writer. As he becomes more popular, he keeps trying to play it cool with varying results. He finds himself getting very used to success and keeps thinking he can just finesse his way out of whatever problems come up. There are also some priceless scenes with the writers he fronts for as he keeps needing to be reminded that he's not the talented one.
Special paragraph for people who hate Woody Allen:
Don't let that stop you from seeing this. It is not ""A Woody Allen Movie."" (aka ""Movie about being neurotic in New York"") Woody Allen plays Prince. He doesn't write, he doesn't direct, he even tones down the uber-nebbish character he usually plays. With everything that's come up about Allen since 1975, it is easy to forget that the guy can be very, very funny.
But even though Woody is the lead, Zero Mostel (in one of his last films) is the star of this picture. In a couple of scenes we watch him go from top-of-the-world everybody-loves-me, to I've-had-a-setback-but-they-still-love-me, to deep despair. This is made particularly poignent since it parallels Mostel's own career. Even if you don't know Mostel's story (he came up through vaudeville and when he was discharged for disability, spent the rest of the war with the USO entertaining the troops, became a huge splash in Hollywood then couldn't work for 10 years when a producer turned his name over the the House of Un-American Committee and Mostel refused to implicate any of his colleagues in the entertainment industry) his peformance is incredible to watch.  You go from hating the guy, to loving him, to pitying him.  His emotions really run the gamut.
If there's one negative, it is that the DVD has NO features at all.  If a flick ever cried out for a special edition, this is it.
So give it a rent when you've got a free night. Its got everything: humor, sex, political intrigue, nostalgia, Danny Aiello as a guy selling fruit, Andrea Marcovicci's film debut, and other historical importance.",1081209600,23,4417,4.824538258575198
701197,5,6303686761,"Woody Allen stars in this sharp political satire, in which a schleppy, low-life bookie is enlisted by an old friend to act as his ""front,"" so that the friend -- a socially progressive  Hollywood screenwriter -- can circumvent the Korean War-era anti-Communist blacklist. Allen is great in his role, projecting his nebbish image onto the Howard Prince character, in a fine turn that makes you wish he'd taken on more acting roles outside of his own films.  Zero Mostel also stars, poignantly, as Hecky Brown, a TV comedian who also runs afoul of the censors -- Mostel's tragic role is made infinitely more moving by the fact that he himself actually was blacklisted in the 'Fifties, as were the film's director, Martin Ritt, the screenwriters and several of the other participants, many of whom star as characters in the film.  Their firsthand experience with the cruelty and absurdity of this dark era in showbiz history comes through loud and clear, as they skewer the suits and sleazes who had ruined their careers decades earlier.  The film's drama and comedy are not sacrificed to the political message, however, and this is a thoroughly entertaining, emotionally moving film.

I wasn't expecting that ending, but it was a great choice. Let's hope we learned something from that period of our country.
