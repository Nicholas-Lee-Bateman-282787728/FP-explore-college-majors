1782402,3,B00006JU7K,"Meng Fei is good in Unbeaten 28, where he must undergo the ""18 obstacles"", receive the ""book"", and then take on the Ghost Faced Killer (Mark Long). There's plenty to like about the film, but lots to be bored with. I thought the first half of the film was a little slow-building, and the end was a bit of a letdown. Oh yeah, the frog scene is just plain strange...

Directed by Joseph Kuo (the Mystery of Chessboxing, 7 Grandmasters, Born Invincible) in 1980.
aka Unbeatable 28

I own the Bonzai dvd version that is a double feature that includes Unbeaten 28 and Shaolin King Boxer (with Leung Kar Yan). 85 minutes, and the box states 2.35:1, though I had to put my HDTV on movie expand 16:9 to really make it look good. The dvd quality is a 3.0 out of 5, not bad but not matching anything close to a Celestial dvd. In fact, it's quite dark at times. The English dubbing is quite good, though some sound effects are flat out strange and goofy (the laughing statue with a hand in the floor, for instance). The disc is a double-sided dvd.

Overall, the film is a 3.0 out of 5. It's entertaining, and has plenty of old-school fu, but it lacks a coherent story and revolves too much around the chambers (""where foes are made of bronze, stone, flesh, and blood""). Mark Long is good, but he plays a strange villain, and relies on technology too much towards the end, rather than hand to hand combat. Similar to 36th Chamber of Shaolin with the training techniques in the chambers.",1323820800,2,1473,4.408088235294118
1782403,3,B00006JU7K,"The Ghostfaced Killer himself (Mark Long, ""The Mystery of Chess Boxing"") is an evil, ambitious fighter, whose latest victim's infant son is taken by the killer's ex-classmate (Jack Long, ""7 Grandmasters"") to train in the Iron Body style of kung fu at Shaolin.  After years and years of laborious practice, the boy (now played by Meng Fei, ""The Green Jade Statuette"") must pass the ultimate test:  The unbeaten 28; consisting of tricks and traps, fighters made of stone and bronze, and a couple of real dudes too.  All of his mental and physical skills will be needed to pass.  Then, if he is successful, he will receive the ultimate training manual which, if studied correctly, will enable him to go after that jerk who killed his parents, and qualify him for a 4.9% APR on a new Chevy Blazer.

This actually came as a bit of a disappointment.  I hate calling out director Joseph Kuo, who mastered the sublime ""7 Grandmasters"" (one of the greatest kung fu films ever made), but this was poorly done.  The whole movie has kind of a choppy, thrown together feel.  The editing is also below average.  The movie doesn't suck, but it could have been SO much better.  It certainly has moments, just not enough of them.  With that in mind, most of the scenes where he works his way through the unbeaten 28 are pretty cool, and the finale is not too shabby, but again, suffers from bad editing.

I was really hoping for a widescreen picture, but Ground Zero pilfered my hopes once again.  Oh, well.  It doesn't suffer too much and the picture quality itself is colorful and fairly decent.  Yet another flick with a debatable rating.  I was leaning toward 2.5/5 but settled on 3.  It was enjoyable enough to recommend, but with some hefty reservations.

1782404,4,B00006JU7K,"I really enjoyed this movie,,,,,I though It started off kinda slow,,,but the old school kung fu absolutely made up for it.  The story carries a tight plot,,the cinematography and choregraphy well done,,,,I do agree with my amazon collague,,this flick appears to be on a fixed butget,,which is as hugh surprize, considering it casted Mark and Jack long,,and directed by the famous Joseph Kuo.  But be not detoured,,this is a must have for the collect, definately a gem!!",1151712000,,469,5.077922077922078
1782405,4,B00006JU7K,"This flick was pretty decent.  Let me explain a little about this flick without giving too much away.

One of the things that I immediately picked up about this one is that there are not a lot of actors here - perhaps ""low budget issues"" - who knows?  Brother ""Tiger"" (played by superstar Meng Fei) is awesome in this one.  Also check him out in ""The Green Jade Statuette"" - another hot flick in my book. The plot picks up very early here!  When Tiger was a baby his parents were killed.  This evil villan (played by Mark Long - aka - Ghost Faced Killer) tried to wipe out the entire family.  The baby was rescued and taken to a Shaolin temple where his teacher was given further instructions on the proper techniques for raising him. This is when he was renamed  ""Tiger."" (This is quite similar to ""Born Invisible"", which is a great flick starring Carter Wong).  Tiger is given a special diet and trained vigorously in kung fu.  He had to endure extreme hardship and not shown pity in the midst of his painful training.

As a child he remained in hiding because the evil villan that killed his family and wrecked havoc in town never stopped looking for him to kill him and all others associated with his family.  When he got older, he was told what happened to his parents.  Tiger sworn to get revenge, but his teacher knew he would be no match for this evil villan if he could not withstand the ultimate test of going up against the Shaolin Unbeaten 28.  He had to do what no one before him had done and each chamber was more difficult than the one before.  At the end of the test, the prize is a book full of Shaolin secret kung fu techniques.  Will his 20 years of kung fu training help him to get past the Shaolin Unbeaten 28?

Although I enjoyed this flick, I must warn you that his sister will soon become quite annoying.  I wanted to completely cut her out of this one altogether!!!!!!",1146355200,,1893,4.329545454545454
1782406,4,B00006JU7K,"I admit This movie was much better than I ever expected. This movie would have gotten a 5 if it weren't for the ending. This storyline is the classic Murder/Revenge-Student/Teacher plot you get in most Kung fu flix. But the training sequences rival that of
the Master Killer. The young student must past the 18 tests in order to get a Famous Fighting styles book. Its not too fake though because he gets his butt whipped plenty of times. So bad you start to feel sorry for the guy. The fight scene with the 80 year old monk who looks like a kid is worth the whole movie. I recommend this as Classic Kung fu. Oh Yeah the villian is Mark Long(Ghost-face killer).",1036022400,,660,4.373983739837398
