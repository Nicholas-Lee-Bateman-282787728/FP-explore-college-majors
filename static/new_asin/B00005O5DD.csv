7948477,3,B00005O5DD,"This set contains four movies about giant creatures run amok. I have reviewed them all separately, so I won't go into great detail here. The set is an interesting collection, and is recommended for people devoted to the genre of cheesy B-movies about nature gone awry.

""Octopus"" is about a giant octopus, but also gets entangled with any number of subplots including the Cuban missile crisis, and diplomatic relations with Bulgaria. It is filled with terrible over-acting, bad sets and a hokey monster.

""King Cobra"" is about a giant bio-engineered snake that terrorizes a small town lager festival. It has entertaining roles by Pat Morita, Hoyt Axton, and Erik Estrada, and is the best of the four films. It has its share of hokey moments, but is far and away the best of these films, bringing the set up to a three star rating. If you buy this set, save this one for last; it's a real treat after the others.

""Spiders"" is insufferably stupid on every level. It features a conspiracy-theory plot enmeshed with giant spiders in what has to be one of the least plausible storylines even by standards of B-grade monster movies.

""Crocodile"" was my least favorite of the four films. Ironically it was made by the best director, Tobe Hooper, but the cast was so thoroughly unpalatable that I wished the crocodile had devoured them all during the opening credits so we could have proceeded to the closing credits directly. I was very amused by the scene in which the crocodile jumps over the top of their boat. Rarely has a computer graphic looked that stupid.

For the B-movie fan, this set may be a good investment as it is much cheaper than the four movies individually. Then again, you may want to consider buying ""King Cobra"" and watching it four times and forgetting the rest: that's what I would do in retrospect.",1211068800,,1817,4.719242902208202
7948478,5,B00005O5DD,"I love these movies! These are great creature flicks! You will not be dissappointed with these movies. Having them in a set makes it much better. It's VERY hard to find so order it now from Amazon.com or dvd destination.com. It's the lowest price you can get it anywhere. Crocodile is about a group of teens who set out for a spring break of fun on a house boat. But when the more immature teens(not that any of them are)stumbles upon a nest of crocodile eggs and smashes all of them but one to pieces,the mother croc sets out on a rampage after her egg which is hidden unknown in a teens back pack leaving a trail of blood in her path. It is awsome! A+.King Cobra is about an experament gone wrong in a lab full of toxic snakes resulting in a giant King Cobra! The 30 foot cobra breaks free and terrorizes the local town members! With a trail of bodies in there path,the local hunters and authorities must track down the beast before it's too late. Love it! A+.Spiders is about a space crew holding mutant spiders in cages. But,on the way down the spiders break free and infest the whole crew. A mad scientist finds the wreck and carries the spiders to his lab. Meanwhile,a girl and her two friends sneak into the lab and see what's going on. Of coarse the spiders break free and start infesting and eating the workers. How will they get out,and how will the stop the spiders?!Very creepy! A+.Octopus is about,guess what?Yep,an octopus. A terrorist bomber is captured and taken one a millitary ship. Little do the know that a giant octopus lurks beneath the water waiting to strike! There are realy two bad guys in this movie. I ended up routing for the octopus! Great effects! A+.This is a great buy for fans of sci-fi animal flicks! In shorter words just get it!",1057363200,5,1765,4.450617283950617
