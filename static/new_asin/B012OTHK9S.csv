7357556,4,B012OTHK9S,"Bottom Line:
Eric Brown, A Pilots Story is somewhat low key and a bit technical for some viewers. If you have an interest in the more technical side of WWII air warfare, or in the history of aircraft design, this is your documentary. It lacks some the kinds of modern computer animation and other flashier techniques of more recent documentaries. It has an almost stereotypical Englishness to it. Most import it has Eric Brown. The much decorated flyer was an interesting man and lived a fascinating life. This is his story and he carries it.

To call Capt. Eric Winkle Brown the British General Chuck Yaeger is not too much of a stretch. Had he heard you do so, I think you would have gotten a taste of his Scotch pride. Captain Brown was not one to take or have his nation take second place to any American.

In this documentary, A Pilots Story the retired warrior and test pilot represents himself and helps gives us an insiders look into the business of wartime flying and later of being one of the first, and by documentation, the most experienced modern test pilots. The Documentary will only say that he holds a number of records. You have to turn to Wiki to get the details. In short, he flew the most different kinds of aircraft, over 450, conducted several first time landings on an aircraft carrier: First for a two engine aircraft (a Mosquito) and the 1st Jet powered aircraft among others. Had the flight program not been cancelled, Capt. Brown and not Chuck Yaeger would have been the first to fly at supersonic speeds.",1477699200,,1533,4.591240875912408
