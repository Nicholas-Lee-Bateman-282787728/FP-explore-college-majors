640502,4,6303425585,"I remember sitting in a dark theater back in '71, gobbling popcorn, slurping coke, and seeing how many Milk Duds could fit in my mouth, when suddenly, ""Willard"" began! I was 9 and nothing could have prepared me for the treat I was about to see! ""Willard"" is the story of a social outcast who has a crazy mother, a total creep of a boss, and no friends. He finds some rats and becomes close to them instead. Ben and Socrates (the white rat) are the standouts. Willard (Bruce Davidson) befriends his furry pals and teaches them lots of tricks. Everything's great until Willard takes Ben and Socrates to work with him. He hides them, but they are discovered. Willard's creepy boss (Ernest Borgnine) kills Socrates. That's when things get ugly! Willard unleashes his rodent horde on his boss, telling them to ""Tear him up!"". It's all downhill from there, as Willard goes increasingly insane, and Ben rises to turn the rats against him. The end is great and spawned the sequel ""Ben"". A classic...",1059004800,41,991,4.668571428571428
640503,4,6303425585,"""Willard"" is not so much a great horror film as it is a [crude] film.  If you are talking about a great horror film where masses of creatures attack humans than go check out Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds.""  With this 1971 film from director Daniel Man we are talking [scaring one with] a whole bunch of rats.  The twist here is that these rats have their own Pied Piper in the person of social misfit, Willard Stiles (Bruce Davidson).  The only friends poor Willard has in this world are his four-legged little friends, including his two favorites, Ben and Socrates, who he starts training to obey his every whim.  Eventually he decides that his boss, Al Martin (Ernest Borgnine), needs to be taught a lesson in what ends up being one of the more memorable scenes by the former Academy Award winning actor.  Willard even finds love in the figure of Joan (Sondra Locke).  Unfortunately, his rat friends do not like being neglected.

This is an old fashioned film, which means these rats were actually trained by Moe and Nora Di Sesso to do thinks like walk planks and chew on someone's face.  No computer generated effects for this film.  But then just the idea of a horde of rats descending on a human being should be enough to send you cowering.  Final Notes: Willard's mom is played by Elsa Lanchester, the original ""Bride of Frankenstein.""  ""Willard"" was followed by the sequel ""Ben,"" with its infamous title song sung by Michael Jackson.  A remake of ""Willard"" is coming out soon and it will be interesting to see if a slick production of this story manages to take it to a new level beyond what this dark little film achieved by the strategic placement of cheese...",1047168000,20,1670,4.620338983050847

I hate to be the one to say this but the sadness did not extend to the human cast at all as they are mostly unlikable. The sad things pertain instead to the rodent population.

If you have never seen it and like creepy horror films you might really get a kick out of it. The very creepy part is that there is no CGI in this movie. The rats, and there are hundreds of them, are the real thing. Very interesting to hear the audio commentary by Bruce Davidson on the behind the camera making of the film and how he had to be covered with hundreds of rats for some scenes, especially the final.  Creepy and fun.  The Blu Ray pressing is impressive. It never looked as good even in the theater. Super sharp image and vivid colors. One of the best Blu Ray transfers I have seen of a vintage film.

640623,5,6303425585,"I haven't read any of the reviews yet but here's mine and I am glad to see this movie ten thousand percent restored the way it should have always been! No...No scenes have been fully restored or scenes added to give it that special look and quality. Back in the 1980's, Willard was still very popular on television after it's 1974 television premiere. In the 1980's, several movies lost they're original releasing-distributors. For all those many years, Willard carried no distributor except for BCP. Now, for the first time since even it's video priemere in 1985, I am proud to say Willard now carries the name of the distributor: From Cinerama Releasing! And it is great! I first saw Willard at Park Forest Theater in downtown Farmers Branch, Texas, in June of 1971 with my family and that made it all the more special. I'm the only one still alive today as my family have all passed since 2005. Willard carries special memories for me, even with the Cinerama Releasing banner. Willard was a character I could closely identify with because of his always being bullied. I hope you enjoy the suspense because that it is. Willard came out 7 years before Halloween. Long before anyone adapted Michael Myers as their favorite movie monster, their was Ben and his army of rats in Willard. All the bad copies of Willard out there are history. When I saw Willard was coming out after all these years, I immediately put in my pre-order. I have had it since May 16, 2017 and I have been watching it unceasingly. If you haven't already, order Willard and watch it. WHERE YOUR NIGHTMARES END, WILLARD BEGINS!",1496534400,4,1598,4.690391459074733
640624,5,6303425585,"Fans of the movie Willard can now finally add this odd little film to their home video collection. With a sparkling new 4K transfer, Willard has never looked this good even in theaters when I saw it in 1971. But wait! What's this? Audio commentary with Bruce Davison?!, YES! Original trailers and TV spots?! YES!!! A 71 count stills gallery and a brief (13 minutes approx.) on screen interview with Davison himself?!.A resounding YES!

Truth is Willard is not a very scary movie, in fact, it plays a lot like a TV movie of the week. That's not to say there isn't a lot to like about this film. I like the use of odd angles and close ups when Willard has to deal with his mother's friends and family (played by some excellent character actors) Davison gives a very memorable performance as the title character, Ernest Borgnine plays the bullying Mr Martin convincingly, Elsa Lanchester (Bride of Frankenstein) as Willard's mother, who can resist such a treat? Also, Locke and Davison have good chemistry as a potential love affair in bloom.

The music score is a bit odd for the first half, it's breezy sounding like something borrowed from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but, the second half's score is more dark and ominous and much more to my liking. I understand the building of tone from light to dark, but the first half score just seems out of place. The rats aren't all that terrifying, but I kind of enjoyed that fact that this film is based on reality and not some super charged CGI fest. The crown jewel of this film is Davison who will forever be the first thing I think about when I think of this film, his performance is underplayed and heartfelt.

This new Blu Ray release is a must buy for fans of this film, it sports a beautiful 4K transfer, it has enough bonus features to make us believe Shout Factory really cared about this release. If I had one real disappointment it's that the sequel Ben wasn't included on this release. For one Ben's coinciding release was transferred from the best surviving elements, while it is acceptable considering the circumstances, it doesn't even come close to Willard's transfer. The film itself is almost a parody of Willard with unintentional laughter throughout and some of the worst hammy acting I've ever seen (by good actors no less!) Even as a kid I knew this movie was abysmal. So considering Ben isn't a very good movie and the transfer is a bit dicey, it would have been great to include it HERE and skip the DVD versions of the films.

The audio commentary is pretty entertaining, though some if it is repeated tidbits from the interview. Davison is candid and I would think amazed at the lasting impression he created in fan's of this films memories. I don't recall seeing him all that much after this film, he was in a Walton's episode or two shortly after this film, but when I saw the first X Men film decades later I immediately knew who he was and was very happy to see him again. My favorite bonus on this release is the original theatrical trailer, it is without a doubt one of the best edited trailers ever made. I'm not kidding, the editor should have received an Oscar for this thing. When I first saw this trailer I was hooked instantly and most fans of this film recite the dialogue the way it is edited in the trailer over the actually film version. ""You made me hate myself! but I like myself now! Tear em up! The trailer is a masterpiece of editing and really sets us up for a little bit of a let down, the film really doesn't live up to the promises of the trailer. Regardless, I'm a big fan of this film, Davison was forever etched in my brain after seeing this film and while I have had a  burned copy on DVD from VHS I was only too happy to finally see a legitimate release of this film on Home Video especially looking so beautiful.

Quick recap, great transfer, bonuses include commentary, stills gallery, interview with the star and trailers including radio and TV spots. Blu Ray and DVD discs included BUY IT! Nuff Said..........",1496275200,6,4025,4.521978021978022

640674,3,6303425585,"Willard Stiles is a repressed, fairly unsociable type of guy, working a desk job that he was shoehorned into by his late father, and saddled with looking after his ailing mother (played by the irrepressible Elsa Lanchester) and caring for a house that is well beyond its prime. He suddenly discovers, much to his delight, that he can make friends with the neighborhood rat population, and one by one he begins to raise, then collect, and then ultimately befriend these rodents, two of whom become his chief allies in his war against boredom, failure, and, especially, his boss...
Apparently having been tied up in litigation for many years and remaining unavailable to those thirsty fans who have so longed to see it again (there was a VHS release--I think by Paramount--quite some time ago, but that was your only option for viewing this movie properly until now), WILLARD is roughly forty-six years too late in making its resurgence, particularly for those fans who have, unfortunately, passed away before they got a chance to see this movie come to Blu-Ray. And, despite its Edgar Award nomination and all of the hype that its clever advertising campaign brought its way years ago when it did boffo business in the theaters, WILLARD teeters uncomfortably between psychological melodrama and black comedy without ever threatening to become a horror film. Perhaps it stands as a grand example of why certain novels simply do not translate well to the medium of film (Herbert's book THE RATS made no feasible mark when transferred to filmmaking hands either), and if you've read Stephen Gilbert's original novel you'll know that the original story was more of a psychological thriller that was probably destined to have a grand career simply by remaining imprisoned upon the printed page. WILLARD, although it means well, is simply too literal and too cartoonish to work successfully as a thriller. However, I personally get a sense of nostalgic joy out of watching it. Ernest Borgnine has a very memorable role in the picture, as does the lovely Locke (during her ""Night Gallery"" period) and the dour Davison (Davison's performance, in fact, is what I feel most hampers the movie--he takes the role to dramatic extremes that are uncalled for, and I feel that he was still trying to find this character, in truth--and yet without him the movie just wouldn't be what it is). WILLARD at times has that TV Movie of the Week feel to it, but this isn't so much a complaint as it is a caution to anyone who may be coming to it anew. As we all know from Glen Morgan's disastrously ill-conceived rehash of this title, the gentle innocence of a picture such as WILLARD simply doesn't translate to modern audiences (although I personally enjoyed Morgan's movie as well) and the end result is a typically languid response from today's video game-indoctrinated crowd. And yet despite its one unwatchable death scene (I'm not talking about the humans in the movie, sadly), WILLARD has a far too breezy and inoffensive feel to it, so much so that younger viewers may wonder what any of the fuss was all about to begin with. It is an entertaining movie to me personally, but I cannot gauge what other genre fans out there may feel about the movie now.
Scream Factory's typically amusing treatment of these hard-to-find titles on Blu-Ray and DVD has a few shades of geek erased for this release. Why didn't someone do a fan art poster for the Blu-Ray? The cover is the same old boring art used during the original ad campaign. Also, there is a shockingly conservative display of extras this time, although what is offered is pretty good. Bruce Davison rolls through his audio commentary like a tank, and it is a joy to listen to him recount his career in the movies and how he's managed to survive as long as he has in the business. Despite some rather creepy snickering that he does in and out here and there, Davison is still a fun guy to hang out with on this particular track. Bruce again turns up for a brief (and I mean brief) on-camera interview in which he reiterates a bit and discusses his feelings about the movie in general. Other than the new transfer of the film itself, this is pretty much it in terms of investigative extras. I for one cannot figure out why a brief featurette on the author Stephen Gilbert was not included here (unless it was not considered due to the copious contractual stipulations that have hung this one up in the courts for decades). Gilbert's novel had to have been brokered under some type of deal years before this movie was greenlit, but apparently we won't ever know the full story on how it was selected for the movies. While some don't feel that film is the writer's medium per se, I would have loved to have seen a rare interview with screenwriter Gilbert Ralston about his own work on WILLARD (heck, even a few audio clips from him would have sufficed). Tragically, WILLARD has arrived afresh without a solid 'making of' documentary, which leads me to believe that either Scream couldn't demand such due to the legal situation surrounding the picture, or that the movie was always of a small stature and didn't warrant any of the cast and crew to get back together to discuss it just for the gratification of us nerds out here.
Now don't get me wrong. It is very nice to see that Scream Factory has rescued WILLARD from litigation hell and put it out for us to snatch up on Blu-Ray AND on DVD. Scream continues doing great work even when I think that they are taking a break (so to speak) from the releases that I really want to get my hands on. But the sad truth is, none of the old rat thriller films have been properly presented on digital media as of yet, and this includes getting proper treatment in the extras department (the look on my face when I saw that DEADLY EYES, for example, didn't include an audio commentary track at all...). Scream's new Blu-Ray and DVD set does look quite amazing in terms of its picture quality and the sound restoration is actually really good as well. But this release needed an audio commentary by a film historian too. It needed to give us some context for what the movie meant to people who saw it when it first came out at the show. It needed to acknowledge the 2003 Glen Morgan remake in order to illustrate how much of a ripple (of whatever seismic scale) that the picture caused in our culture during the latter half of the 20th century. And it really needed a tribute to Stephen Gilbert himself, an author whose work is too little represented on film. C+ (for what we got)",1493424000,3,6553,4.645133505598622

Rat-themed movies too often go for pure gore or totally silly stories. ""Willard"" does neither.

Bruce Davison, Elsa Lanchester, Ernest Borgnine and Sondra Locke give good performances as one might expect from actors of their competence and standing.

The rats, trained by Moe and Nora Di Sesso, are not exaggerated nor are they computer-generated.  They are the domestic variety of course, and any viewers who have pet rats will find Socrates, Ben and their many friends and family far more adorable than frightening.

Unlike too many ""horror"" movies with rats or other animals, this movie is under-stated rather than trying to be ""in-your-face"".  To all appearances Willard is a normal, reasonably good-looking young man who has found himself in a frustrating and angering situation. Everything else on the surface seems normal as well.  His mother is both dependent and whiny, but not weird.  The house that plays an important part in the story is huge, old and somewhat decrepit, but it is not haunted or filled with outrageous decor. The other characters are also within the bounds of normal, even the somewhat overbearing neighbor Charlotte who tries to befriend Willard.

Willard, pretty much friendless, feckless and believing himself to be a failure, nevertheless finds success in training the rats that show up on his property.  Except for his feelings for Socrates he is, however, often ambivalent about the rest of the rats and especially about Ben.  Why this is we never exactly find out, but his ambivalence towards Ben is the fateful turn that leads to the climax of the story.  I shan't dwell on the details of the story since I am assuming that most people interested in the movie are already familiar with them.

It is good to find a DVD version of this classic movie and I am hoping that eventually a more clear ""remastered"" version will become available.",1377129600,10,2109,4.819444444444445

I have had 4 pet rats off and on for years and find them to be intellegent and affectionate (excellent pets) and always rooted for the ratties!!! You go Ben!!",1232409600,,524,4.447916666666667

Growing up in the 70's who could forget the great poster from this movie?(which I am lucky enough to own)the creepy trailer(which is scarier than the film) and an incredible and eerie performance by Bruce Davidson, which is too good for this lovable, but sub-par film.

If not for Davidson, Borgnine and the rats this movie would be a bad TV movie of the week! Regardless, I have fond memories of this film and I would like to see it released on DVD! I would buy it and I know I'm not alone. Where your nightmares end.....Willard begins!",1183939200,10,600,4.504587155963303
640768,2,6303425585,"However, there's alot in this movie that annoys me. I know it's helped me to develop a fear of all mice and rats alike. I also know that the secratary of this movie played by Joan Shawnabe has a uncanny knack to shrink a guy's testicles; that's right folks just make you feel so bad about yourself that your once proud pair are now shrunken heads between your legs.  You know those type of women gentlemen; we've all had them cross our paths at one time or another. Those who seem to be rather uncaring towards anyone who crosses thier path unless it's to help them succeed. Meaning poor Willard is nothing but a eunuch to her, a leper, and anything else you want to consider. She wears those dresses that show off her curves that makes you want to grab her close, and wet her dress with semen, but don't go there she's not worthy of your knowing her. She's not worthy of being a human, but since we live under grace it was shown to her here. Yes Ernest Borgnine deserved to be killed by Ben and Socrates, and so did the people who mocked and laughed at Willard, so WHY WAS SHE SPARED?!!!!! She deserved to die also, to feel the rats cover her face in turds, the claws cutting her face up, and her hair being chewed up, making her cry, and do many other bodily functions. This is some rather gory stuff isn't it? well let's face it folks as I said earlier we've all had this kind of girl/woman cross our path at one time or another, and this is a bull session to get it out what we would like to have happen to them because it wasn't done in this movie. Willard you have to pity him at times here because of what he had gone through with taking over of his father's company, and being demoted to almost a janitor, and his mother is not faring any better as she's having a mental breakdown from it all. I do feel that Willard had something going for him with Sondra Locke as his main squeeze in this movie. That's like the most beautiful girl falling in love with the toadboy in school, and that's where Willard made his mistake. You see Willard forgot to give credit to the rats. Mind you since he was considering marriage to Sondra he couldn't keep them, but he at least could've set them free instead of trying to drown them, but then again Willard was rather prideful because Sondra fell in love with him for himself, and not because he had rats that would devour all thier enemies. This is not fluff, but it's not all that great either. I don't plan on watching this ever again, and why I'm here is to tell everyone how I feel about the secratary. She's hot, but don't play with fire, and that's the same message of this movie.",1158796800,,2631,4.262
640769,5,6303425585,"Although it's hard to compare he remake featuring CRISPIN GLOVER to the classic original with a very young BRUCE DAVISON (X-MEN) I have to say the original is truely better.

The newer version is definately a modern telling of the tale and also contains a bit of the sequel in it.. (elements of BEN) and is definately creepier

BUT you definately have to see the original to truely understand the impact is has on the remake.

Did I make any sense.. oh well we're talking about a movie where a guy names rats and becomes friends with them.. get over it..

BUY THIS WHILE IT'S THERE!",1149292800,,582,4.462264150943396

It would surly be a sin though to release Willard without its great sequel, ""Ben"". They are a MUST to be viewed together:-)",1117497600,3,170,4.3125
7846042,1,6303425585,"Glacial pace. Unbelievably bad soundtrack. Horrid acting. I've always personally despised Bruce Davison and was shocked to realize he was the guy who played Willard.

This is a movie I thought I remembered from my childhood. I thought I remembered it as a great movie. Boy, how wrong I was. I forced myself to watch to the end - it took me three days because I could not sit through more than ten minutes of it at a time - just so I could tell myself I'd watched it.",1525737600,,466,4.235955056179775
