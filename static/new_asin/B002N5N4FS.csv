3956175,5,B002N5N4FS,How I Met Your Mother is a great comedy show about a man in New York finding his wife.  Season five is just as hilarious as the first four and is totally worth watching.,1286668800,,169,3.9705882352941178
3956176,4,B002N5N4FS,"24 Episodes on 5 DVD Discs, released September 21, 2010

""How I Met Your Mother"" swaggers into its fifth season on DVD, a face that has probably surprised many. The premise is that an older narrator (voiced by Bob Saget) is telling the really, really, REALLY long story to his kids of how he met their mother after many, many, MANY stories about other women he dated first and his core group of friends. With a premise that seems like it can't go anywhere unless you introduce the mother, they've successfully managed to keep viewers on the hook this long and keep the show funny due to the hilarious supporting cast surrounding Ted, whom the story is supposed to be based around.

Ted Mosby is played by Josh Radnor and is by far the least interesting character on the show. It's very telling when Amazon describes the show as ""the outrageous, Emmy-nominated hit starring Neil Patrick Harris, Jason Segel and Alyson Hannigan!"" Neil Patrick Harris plays Barney, a brilliant, confident womanizer with a penchant for suits. Alyson Hannigan and Jason Segel play a married couple of Lily and Marshall. She wears the pants in the relationship and he goes along with everything she wants and they try desperately to go on couple dates with other couples and are pretty funny. The other friend in their group is Robin played by Cobie Smulders, an ex-girlfriend of Ted's who gets along well with the group who acts more like one of the guys sometimes.

Ted is constantly over-analyzing situations and trying to play the romance why-can't-I-find-the-one card, but it gets old and annoying. Really, he should be thanking his lucky stars that he gets to date ANY of these tons of girls that fall into his lap at all. It's pretty much unclear why any of them are attracted to him and he just isn't very interesting. The narrator version of him gets more laughs.

Thankfully, there are subplots with the other cast members who are more than up for the challenge. Neil Patrick Harris is in the lead for charm, charisma, and comedy. He can pick up almost any woman, looks great in a suit, and is an expert on absolutely everything EVER. Whether it is leading a musical number (he as an actor AND the song were both nominated for Emmys), pulling out the little black book of pick-ups, or masquerading as Lorenzo Von Matterhorn, NPH is the MAN. He has been nominated for four consecutive years for an Emmy and the last two for a Golden Globe on this series so clearly he is the main reason to watch.

Alyson Hannigan isn't too far behind for laughs reminding us all why we loved her in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" but giving her more free rein in character here. I had only seen Jason Segel before in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Knocked Up"" and was a little disappointed here to see him so whipped. He is always playing second fiddle to Lily and the guys and while he gets some great outbursts of humor, he is mostly there for reactions to other characters' conversations and actions. Apparently the series started out with the two characters shagging like rabbits constantly as their only joke, but they have calmed down since then getting their own place and try to domestic the joint up.

Robin begins the series with Barney and the two attempt to wear the titles ""girlfriend"" and ""boyfriend"" for a while, but it doesn't last because Barney is better not being tethered down by monogamy. After that Robin goes through a disappointing period of mourning and then attempts to date other guys striking up a relationship with a fellow news anchor. She represents a piece of Ted's past and I'm sure many people wondered if they'd ever get back together, but that won't be the case since a good hint is given away this season and you get to see a foot belonging to ""the mother"" when Ted is attempting to date her roommate and just misses meeting her. You'll also get to see Ted find a house that becomes the house the kids are sitting in hearing the story.

The friends all have careers of one type or another (college professor, lawyer, kindergarten teacher, news anchor), but mostly spend time at the bar below their apartment drinking with each other like many other sitcoms with a watering hole everyone congregates at. There are tons of guest stars this season like Rachel Bilson as the roommate of the mother character yet to be introduced, Jennifer Lopez as a conquest of Barney's, Carrie Underwood as a woman who keeps Ted on the hook, Alan Thicke playing an ex of Robin's, and Chris Elliot playing Lily's father.

One of the commentaries has some honesty from the creators admitting how lucky they were to have such a strong, loyal fanbase given that the show did not really hit its stride until the fourth season or so where it was easier to figure out what would be funniest coming out of whose mouth and who these characters really were so if you were to start watching in say, Season 5, you wouldn't be missing much beforehand since they've hit their momentum now. Once again, you MUST watch this show for Neil Patrick Harris, Alyson Hannigan, and Jason Segel. Amazon is right on this point. Wait Ted's scenes out and pray that when he meets the mother, he's mature enough to recognize it finally.

Bonus Features:

There is commentary on the ""Girls vs Suits"" episode with NPH, Craig Thomas, and Pam Fryman where they point out the one dancer wearing sneakers, every injury NPH sustained during the filming of the dance number, and talking about the hints given about the mother during the 100th episode. The commentary on ""The Perfect Week"" features Craig Gerard, Matt Zinman, and Joe Kelly. The commentary on ""Duel Citizenship"" features Cobie Smulders and Chuck Tatham.

There are also bloopers, an extended version of ""The Wedding Bride"" trailer, a series recap (which I probably should have watched first if I had read the back cover more closely), and music videos. You also get the making of ""Super Date"" and behind the scenes of the 100th episode, both of which had musical numbers in them.",1286582400,,5994,4.68281101614435
3956177,5,B002N5N4FS,How I Met Your Mother is one of those shows that grew on me over the years. Season 1 had some semi-lame writing but the show progressively got better as years went by. Season 5 definitely was one of the funniest seasons and I love that the cast members ventured into musicals. I highly recommend it!,1286323200,,299,4.357142857142857
3956178,4,B002N5N4FS,"This is my favorite sitcom.  I don't understand why the studio is not releasing a Blu-ray edition of this season.  I'm holding off on buying the set this year in anticipation of the BrD.  (And as I haven't seen any of the episodes yet, that really hurts...)  (One star is for the format - or rather, lack of.  Otherwise, I'm pretty sure there's at least a 4-star rating waiting in the wings...)",1284076800,7,394,4.416666666666667
3956179,5,B002N5N4FS,"Kids... I hope you brought your notebooks, because the story of how I met your mother is a lot longer than you might think...

You get the feeling with each passing season that Ted Mosby's ""story"" is not so much about how he met his wife, but a cleverly disguised series of lessons for his adolescent kids as they enter young adulthood. That's not to say his quest for ""the one"" is actually just a footnote in the story, though. Many of the things Ted learned along the way were directly connected to his search for the elusive Mrs. Mosby. It just so happens that after five seasons, information has leaked regarding the wife's identity, but we've still yet to ""meet"" her. I know CBS has a good thing going with this show, but I'm wondering how much longer the writers can stall this inevitable meeting without the story becoming completely absurd.

**Possible Spoilers in Next Section**
For HIMYM fans who are drawn in by Ted Mosby's journey to find his soul mate, Season 5 may come as a mild disappointment. The 100th episode was monumental, not just for the show itself, but for fans thirsting for details on the future Mrs. Mosby. However, outside of that episode there was very little advancement made in the whole ""meeting your mother"" facet of the show. Now for fans who might be more indifferent to the sentimentality of the show, or just have no problem with the stall for the sake of prolonging the series, this is a fantastic season. S5 more than any was centered around Barney Stinson, whose story ranged from serious relationships to sexual escapades more unique and insane than ever before, ""The Playbook"" (ep. 8) and ""The Perfect Week"" (ep. 14) in particular. As simple as it seems, my favorite single moment of the entire series came in the first episode of this season when Ted is teaching his first college class and is panicking because he doesn't know if ""professor"" has one ""f"" or two.
The first seven episodes focused mainly on the evolving relationship between Barney and Robin, a real leap of faith taken by the writers given the fact that Barney's ""womanizer"" status had always been a major theme of the show. Daring as it was, it didn't disrupt the flow of the show and the aftermath made for some hilarious episodes and epic moments.
**  **  **

High Points of the Season:
- Barney Stinson's song & dance number in ""Girls Versus Suits"" (ep. 12) (also the 100th episode)
- ""The Window"" (ep. 10) - We all know that one person who is never single
- New York Yankee outfielder Nick Swisher's guest appearance in ""The Perfect Week""
- Ted's literal ""double"" date in ""Double Date"" (ep. 2) displays some of his most endearing... and annoying mannerisms
- ""Last Cigarette Ever"" (ep. 11) for its realistic portrayal of the difficulty in quitting
- Ted makes an impulse purchase in ""Home Wreckers"" (ep. 20)
- We get a full dose of Ted's intellectual side in ""Robots Versus Wrestlers"" (ep. 22)
- The introduction of the doppelgangers and the impact it has over the course of the season
- The yellow umbrella (we assume) makes its way back to its rightful owner in the 100th episode
- The fourth slap in ""Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"" (ep. 9)
- Robin's path to U.S. citizenship in ""Duel Citizenship"" (ep. 5)

One of the things I like most about the show is their tendency to bring past themes back to the present. For example, the famous ""naked man"" routine makes a surprise appearance in Season 5. There are still consistent references to Ted's ex-fiance Stella and even her beau, Tony, makes an unexpected contribution to one episode. Lily can't seem to shake her old flame, Scooter, and Ted unveils the blue french horn one more time.

I honestly don't think the show is declining at all. The amazing thing is that I thought the writers would have trouble coming up with stories for Marshall and Lily once they got married, yet they're still coming up with great ideas for the couple. The originality is bewildering for having written 112 episodes. How I Met Your Mother is still one my favorite shows and I'm looking forward to the 6th season.

3956180,4,B002N5N4FS,"My husband and I BOTH love this t.v. show- which is a miracle!  We have such different taste in sitcoms that we were amazed it appealed to both of us.  With that being said I would say the best two seasons of this show are the 2nd and 3rd seasons- the humor is top notch and will have you laughing out loud each episode.  I found that after the 3rd season things have gone done hill... beginning with last season and then sliding down more with this 5th season.

*SPOILER ALERT* Part of the reason I think this season wasn't as funny was b/c Robin and Barney date for a good chunk of it, which takes the most humorous part of the show- Barney and his womanizing ways- out of the picture.  Some of the funnier episodes are the ones after their relationship is over.  I'm all for thinking that Robin and Barney will end up together in the END... so hopefully they won't touch this area again until then!
*END SPOILER ALERT*

Since we own the first four seasons on DVD, I feel compelled to continue our collection by getting this one.  All in all it's not a bad season... it's just not nearly as good as their first three seasons.  It definitely helps move the story along of how Ted meets his wife though- and we actually get to learn more about her (finally!)  So in that regard it's definitely worth the watch.  Maybe Netflix it to see if you like it before you buy it though!",1275609600,10,1376,4.274131274131274

A great cast with a beautiful chemistry, HIMYM can do no wrong in my book.",1273536000,16,327,4.290322580645161
3956182,3,B002N5N4FS,"Most episodes are ok, some good, and some suck (like zoo or false). Members of the cast are fat for a portion of the season, and many times it seems like they aren't trying to act well. Plots are becoming ridiculous in order to drag on the series. Most episodes don't have anything to do with Ted's ""How I met your mother"" tale. I am still a customer because  of how good seasons 1 and 2 were. Maybe not for long though...",1271116800,,422,4.146341463414634

I am not sure why the same. continued focus on ""who is sleeping with who"" has to be the baseline for almost every episode of this show.  I think that the characters are very well written, and that the overall story (and continuity between episodes) is really good, but the only reason I don't give this series a 5-star rating is that the characters are all just a little overly sexualized....and sometimes, it just feels a bit much.",1405123200,3,512,4.4361702127659575

3957328,5,B002N5N4FS,I never watched himym on cbs and only caught late night syndicated reruns on local channels because I work all day and night. The more I watched it the more I absolutely appreciated the show as one of my all time favorites regardless of genre. So being able to binge watch it on Amazon instant video has been a really nice option after work. There are episodes in each season I've watched that I never saw before and catching up on the ones I have in context of how they aired during their actual seasons makes everything make more sense. Season five marks the half way mark of the shows run and while some shows have worn themselves out by this point himym Just keeps getting better in my opinion.,1403481600,,698,4.376923076923077

3957374,4,B002N5N4FS,"HIMYM follows a similar formula in most episodes, but that also creates a feeling of familiarity with the characters. By Season 5, the viewer feels like they really know Ted, Barney, Lilly, Marshall, and Robin. Barney has some hilarious one-liners and Marshall's goofy and animated style balance out the dry and boring Ted.

Obviously, I recommend starting this show with Season 1 and working towards Season 5. Although some episodes could be enjoyable without knowing the whole back story, it is much better to have a context that only comes from watching from Season 1.",1395100800,,571,5.010526315789473

3957378,4,B002N5N4FS,"RECAP: The series follows Ted, an architect telling his children the story of how he met their mother. Each season shows Ted and his friends experiencing all of the moments and antics that will eventually/hopefully lead to Ted meeting and falling in love with his future wife. In general, it's probably necessary to have watched the previous seasons before jumping in at Season 5, since there are references to the past and previous character development plays a role.  I've come to terms with the fact that IF we ever learn who the mother is, it will be the very last episode. Despite being trailed along all this time, the happenings of Ted and his friends are incredibly funny. To some degree, their regular antics do get a little old, but in the next season the writers begin to change things up and lend a little story-freshening. I do like this show and it's one you can watch several times, though I recommend having the seasons on hand because it is kind of important to be able to watch them in order. This is a well-written and family appropriate show that keeps fans begging for more.

Season 5 kicked off in the fall of 2009 with main characters:  Josh Radnor as Ted Mosby, Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson, Cobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky, Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin, and Jason Segel as Marshall Eriksen. As the series progresses it is also picking up more and more celebrity cameos [ehem, did you know that the voice of ""future Ted"" in the precaps is actually Bob Saget?]; Season 5 features cameos from Chris Elliott as Mickey Aldrin, Marshall Manesh as Ranjit, Sarah Wright as Claire, Joe Manganiello as Brad Morris, Charles Chun as Mr. Park, Lindsay Sloane as Jen, Carrie Underwood as Tiffany, Nick Swisher as himself, Stacy Keibler as Krina, Judy Greer as Royce, Chris Kattan as Jed Mosely, Rachel Bilson as Cindy, Amanda Peet as Jenkins, Peter Bogdanovish as himself, and Jennifer Lopez as Anita Appleby.

SEASON 5:  The previous season left us all on a cliff-hanger.  The finale bombshell was the confession of love between Robin and Barney.  Thankfully, Season 5 picks up right where Season 4 left off, and ends with Ted finally letting us know that he had already (at this point in the re-telling) ""met"" his kids' mother.  While we're no closer to knowing who the mother is, we are still dying to find out.

Episode 1:  ""Definitions""--Ted starts his career as a university professor with an embarrassing blunder; Lily discovers Barney and Robin's secret.

Episode 2:  ""Double Date""--Barney and Marshall discover Lily's doppelganger; Ted goes on a blind date repeat.

Episode 3:  ""Robin 101""--As Robin and Barney attempt to strengthen their relationship, Barney is caught making a Robin `cheat sheet.'

Episode 4:  ""The Sexless Innkeeper""--Marshall and Lily have high expectations of their new couple-friends.  Ted discovers that the location of his apartment may be more attractive to a girl than he is; revenge/self-validation is sweet.

Episode 5:  ""Duel Citizenship""--Robin's vivacious personality leads to an assault charge, forcing her to choose between Canada and the United States.  When Marshall and Ted's favorite pizzeria plans to close, they make a trip to Chicago for one last slice and a final frontier of bro-mance.

Episode 6:  ""Bagpipes""--The ""bagpipes"" played by Ted's neighbors are disturbing his peace.  Barney incites a domestic power-struggle between Lily and Marshall, but Ted figures out that Barney did it intentionally to make his fights with Robin seem less problematic.

Episode 7:  ""The Rough Patch""--Robin and Barney's relationship becomes hazardous to their personal happiness; the gang decides it's time to break them up.  The couple, despite their friends' meddling, makes the decision on their own.

Episode 8:  ""The Playbook""--Robin and Barney call different post-relationship plays; Robin focuses on her career, though Marshall and Ted insist she's focusing on her coworker.  Barney picks up where he left off in the game of picking up chicks.

Episode 9:  ""Slapsgiving 2:  Revenge of the Slap""--Much to Lily's dismay, Marshall invites Lily's father to their Thanksgiving feast.  Marshall rewards Ted and Barney for their turkey-saving deed by giving them one of his slaps from the remaining slap-bet allowance.

Episode 10:  ""The Window""--Marshall reunites with the dreams of his younger self and has to reevaluate his mid-life standing.  The gang tries to keep Ted's window-of-opportunity with his dream girl open long enough for him to strike before she gets a new boyfriend.

Episode 11:  ""Last Cigarette Ever""--Due to work conditions, Marshall revives his smoking habit and it spreads to the rest of the group.  The tension between Robin and he co-anchor, Don, escalates.

Episode 12:  ""Girls vs. Suits""--Barney's new ""challenge"" doesn't care for his favorite go-to-attire.  When Ted dates Cindy, we get our first known peek at his future wife (Cindy's roommate).

Episode 13:  ""Jenkins""--Ted invents a drinking game based on Robin's TV interviews, but Robin gets the last laugh.  To prevent feelings of jealousy from Lily, Marshall deliberately fails to divulge that his new friend and coworker, Jenkins, is female.

Episode 14:  ""The Perfect Week""--Ted fumbles in the classroom by offending a student; Barney, with the support of the gang, goes for the `perfect week' by attempting to pick up a new girl every night for seven straight days.

Episode 15:  ""Rabbit or Duck""--Ted considers an arranged marriage.  Don invites Robin to spend time with him on Valentine's Day; Robin is conflicted in her feelings.  Barney acquires an influx of interested women after posting his phone number during the Super Bowl.

Episode 16:  ""Hooked""--Matters between Ted and his new love interest, Tiffany, bring on the revelation that everyone (even if they're married) keeps an admirer on-the-hook.

Episode 17:  ""Of Course""--Robin has been secretly holding in her distaste for hearing about Barney's `conquests.'  She seeks out an author, Anita, who writes about being a professional rejecter to men's advances in hopes that Anita can successfully put Barney in his place.

Episode 18:  ""Say Cheese""--Lily becomes frustrated with the succession of group photos, mainly because Ted is never pictured with the same woman twice; she upset that Ted constantly welcomes new dates into their exclusive gang, which creates a rift between Marshall, Lily, and Ted (and Ted's new girlfriend).

Episode 19:  ""Zoo or False""--When Marshall gets mugged at the zoo, he tells Lily not to worry because the bandit was actually one of the monkeys.  Interested in the monkey story, Robin convinces Marshall to be interviewed on her show.  Marshall confesses that he made up the thieving monkey to ease Lily's fears, though what REALLY happened remains a mystery.

Episode 20:  ""Home Wreckers""--Barney drops a bombshell about Ted's mom.  As a result of personal crisis, Ted buys a house in the suburbs in hopes that he can turn it into a home.

Episode 21:  ""Twin Beds""--Sleeplessness leads Marshall and Lily to purchase twin beds.  Barney and Ted begin to realize the seriousness of Robin's relationship with Don; the two boys regress in maturity about which of them is best for Robin, but they end up pushing her further away.

Episode 22:  ""Robots vs. Wrestlers""--The gang crashes a party after Ted intercepts an invitation intended for someone else.  Barney wants everyone to join him at the Robots vs. Wrestlers fight, but the initial no-shows leave him feeling as if everyone is drifting apart.

Episode 23:  ""The Wedding Bride""--Tony releases a film based on the ending of Ted and Stella's engagement which highlights an outsider's opinion of the baggage Ted has been toting around.

Episode 24:  ""Doppelgangers""--It is revealed that Lily and Marshall made a pact concerning the right time to begin having children, and it hinges on finding each member of the gang's doppelganger.  Robin refuses a job in Chicago in order to stay with Don... and offer that he later accepts in her place.",1382918400,3,8035,5.108979278587874

3957452,4,B002N5N4FS,"Season Five was a transitional year for the How I Met Your Mother gang. Ted took a job teaching architecture at Columbia, which mirrored his attempts to reboot his love life without a Robin or Victoria or Stella in the picture. We finally got to see Barney and Robin attempt to be a couple, which, while contrived, was at least more interesting than Barney's silly pining through Season Four. Thankfully, that relationship ended quickly enough so Barney could return to the outrageous ways that made him a breakout character in the first place.

This opened the door for HIMYM to play to its biggest strength: exploring the ups and downs of relationships of people in their late 20s and early 30s. ""Double Date"" examined the mistakes people make on dates and where to draw the line on people's little quirks. ""Robin 101"" was a fun look at the things people remember about their exes. ""Say Cheese"" focused on Ted's habit of bringing one-time dates to milestone events. These episodes reflect HIMYM at its strongest, finding humor out of everyday life.

Of course, HIMYM has never shied away from over-the-top humor, which it pursued with mixed results. The show's 100th episode contained the big ""Suits"" musical number, ""The Playbook"" featured Barney at his womanizing best, and Marshall's ""Cat Funeral,"" based on his habit of creating musical montages out of mundane events, may have been the best gag of the year. On the other hand, ""Slapsgiving 2"" felt like a pale parody of earlier Slap Bet episodes, and the running ""doppleganger"" gag never really clicked.

On the negative side, this season showed a preoccupation with stunt casting, with a lot of guest stars that didn't really click. Barney chasing a 40-ish Jennifer Lopez fell flat, and Jim Nantz's stiff turn covering Barney's pursuit of a ""perfect week"" was just creepy. It's understandable that the show would jump all over promotable guest stars like J-Lo or Carrie Underwood, but HIMYM has historically been better when using non-celebrities as the objects of the characters' affections, and a lot of Season Five's guest spots felt unnecessary at best.

The biggest disappointment on the 3-DVD set is a lack of extras. Out of 24 episodes, only 3 have commentary tracks, and there's not much else other than a gag reel and featurettes on the ""Suits"" and ""Super Date"" musical numbers. It's a huge missed opportunity: it's been a pleasure listening to the show's stars and creators talk shop on previous DVDs, and the lack of commentary tracks makes the release feel lazy, something we'll hopefully see improved in future sets.

It's good to see HIMYM's creators continue to show ambition as the series continues, and Season Five had plenty of great moments. But the lack of DVD extras (not to mention the show's current saturation in syndication) ultimately makes this set a must for only the biggest of HIMYM fans.",1329782400,,2876,4.933884297520661

Still a HUGE fan, but this isn't my favorite season by any means, it was just pretty lackluster.

Where all other seasons would get 5 stars, I can only really give this one 3 - it's okay.

With that said, though, I don't regret buying it, but I would have definitely waited until the price went down had I known.",1288137600,8,734,4.503759398496241

The previous four seasons have been fantastic, sincere and corny yet hip somehow, but season 5 is a disappointment for me. There are some great moments (the suit song for sure; the portrayal of Lily and Marshall's relationship remains a high point) but the writing has delved into mere camp based on the character's quirks. This is NOT good writing. The fat suit episode was pretty bad, Ted Mosby has become insufferable, the Robin character is still not used enough, and the monkey/wallet episode...well...I actually felt bad the actors had to work on that one. There's a lot to admire about this show - the chops of everyone on the cast for certain - but this season is a very weak link in an otherwise superior sitcom.",1288051200,6,822,4.5608108108108105

3957528,5,B002N5N4FS,"The show is fantastic and deserves its five stars, we watched it on our PS3 for season 5 as downloadable content, in HD.  So, we know it already exists in 1080p HD format, so what is the holdup with releasing it on blu-ray?

If studios would like to propagate the blu-ray format, WITHHOLDING desired content from that format is NOT the way to do so.  If the sales of season 4 on blu-ray didn't meet expectations, fine, produce less this time around, or produce only 110% of pre-orders, and continue to do that for as many runs as demand requires.

It boggles the mind that a studio would withhold the more expensive (read: profitable) format of a show simply because their sales of that format didn't meet their expectations last year.

Please release the show on blu-ray, so I can clear up space on my PS3's hard drive -- and support the studio producing such a fine show.",1287446400,,873,4.5
