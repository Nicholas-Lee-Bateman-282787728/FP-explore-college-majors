8455159,5,B0053DB4WC,"This is an amazing story of a cavalry sergeant who has outlived his time.  Richard Boone gives a film-quality performance in this episode of CIMARRON STRIP and it's not to be missed.  Without Boone this would have been an average run-of-the-mill yawn of a tale, but he brings it.

When Boone's in frame you cannot watch anyone else.  He drinks and roisters with his troop and they (accidentally) burn down part of the town.  His fight scene with Stuart Whitman is a classic.  Boone and Whitman had been friends for years and they clearly had fun with this.

When this episode was first broadcast there was talk of an Emmy nomination, but Boone was too much of a renegade in Hollywood.  His performance is no less Emmy-worthy for that.  It's a scandal Richard Boone was nominated 5 times and never won.  Still, his acting is preserved for all time for us to see, and we can still enjoy his artistry.  When Sergeant Disher realises his Captain is gone, his plaintive tones bring a tear to my eye every time.  His  soliloquy about the passing of the west is beautiful to behold.

Buy it here, stream it on Netflix or catch it on Encore West, but see it!  Richard Boone was a true master of his craft.  We have none like him today, and we're the poorer for it.  He left us far too soon when he died of oral cancer at age 63.  Oh, Dick, we hardly knew ye.",1325980800,2,1350,4.353413654618474
