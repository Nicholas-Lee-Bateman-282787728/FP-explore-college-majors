8212756,5,B000UAKZH8,Best workout for stomach.  Just wished this was on DVD.  Use older VHS player in basement so I can workout with this.,1424217600,,117,4.2727272727272725

8212758,5,B000UAKZH8,I have been using it for 3 weeks and it has been good for me. I had been sick a long time and use this tape to help me gain my strength back. The exercises are easy enough for me to do yet I still get a work out. I like that it says to do only 2 to 3 times a week as I find that easier to do then every day.,1240531200,,307,3.219178082191781
8212759,5,B000UAKZH8,I love this workout. All through it Michelle gives good safety tips. I love how she has you hold at the contraction. You really feel your abs working. The 15 minutes goes by very quickly. I love how you also work your legs and butt as well as your abs.,1198800000,5,252,4.06
