2453881,5,B000C8STTY,"Excellent graphics, intriguing story, and the fantastic invention of a non-existent sport using ""Mechwarrior"" robots in ""Extreme-G"" races combine to create a show that will suprisingly hook you into the entire world of Toonami...and make you wish The Immortal Grand Prix was a real-life sport. I was on the edge of my seat...for the 20 minute promo DVD. I watched it twice cause I couldn't get over the talking cat with an attitude. That was awesome. It was very impressive. I TIVO every one of these on TV and I'm buying all the volumes on DVD.

I can't wait for a soundtrack. Talk about getting you pumped, the music is great. I hate techno and I hate all the stupid Computer Generated Crud, but when I hooked up my speakers to the TV this music surrounded my room better, louder and smoother than most of my CD music.

It blew me away when I saw the quality of this show. Hands down this is my favorite new Toonami.",1134172800,7,918,4.458333333333333
8096283,5,B000C8STTY,"This edition has the too Nami version of the dub ( better music -Amon Tobin) box feels weird but in a quirky way can get enough of the first few episodes, and planning on getting the rest of the box sets for Christmas !",1507680000,,219,4.0
8096284,5,B000C8STTY,"amazing! love it! fast prompt! amazing, must buy, 6 stars all the way golwing review!~ buy from this seller and the items from them!",1446163200,,132,4.541666666666667
8096285,3,B000C8STTY,"DVD was fine and great, but the problem was that however the box was kept, the shirt inside's decal was actually cracked severely throughout. Shirt is fine enough (a bit heavy in terms of material, and not really the softest, but at least the shirt will survive repeated wear/washings if I choose to stop having it as a collectible; with the decal cracking, might as well to be honest).",1445299200,,386,4.608695652173913
8096286,5,B000C8STTY,Got to love the t-shirt!,1416355200,,24,4.0
8096287,5,B000C8STTY,I already had the season 1 and 2 box set but I wanted to get the shirt while it was still available since IGPX isn't in production anymore and for the price I couldn't pass it up.,1355356800,,179,3.864864864864865
8096288,5,B000C8STTY,"I remember watching this series back when it was on toonami, it was ok, but not great. while not impressed with the show, I couldn't pass up a fancy box and a t-shirt... for 97 cents. turns out its actually a pretty good box set. the dvd contains the first 4 episodes in eng and jap, contrary to the 1 episode that the amazon discription says there is. the art box is pretty neat looking and... fluffy? theres also a team satomi t-shirt that is very nice. overall its a very nice set and worth the money I paid, and maybe more if you're a fan.",1352851200,,543,4.132075471698113
8096289,5,B000C8STTY,Sadly losing its' way at the end. Beautiful animation from start to finish was the entire -short- show and the very first DvD showed it all in spades.,1262131200,,150,4.392857142857143
8096290,5,B000C8STTY,"IGPX...hmm

Last year, the original IGPX was broadcast on Toonami in 4-5 five minute episodes for a total of like a 20 minute special. It didn't involve racing but did involve it being a team sports. Instead of racing it was just simple fighting.

NOW:

The news of this new iGPX was that it was being coproduced by the US (Cartoon Network) with the Japanese studio. I had very low expectations for this anime, I had seen how the Jetix Original shows had been and...*shudders*

A few weekends ago was the premiere. I was pretty impressed; I liked it. From a basic perspective, it's an average anime. However there was something about it...maybe becauser it doesn't involve a saving-the-world plot? the sports like feel? the overally bearable dubbing quality?

I do know one reason for sure I like it; its pacing. It manages to get a lot in one episode without feeling too rushed. Usually with a few stories going at once and/or one half of a race and another half of another one. It flows really nicely from my view.

8096291,5,B000C8STTY,"Athough IGPX has only been aired for a few months, I have not missed an episode yet. When I first heard the name ""IGPX"" mentioned in the Toonami lineup, I thought I was going to see a series adaptation of the Robot-Fighting Battle Royale OAV that Toonami aired once in the late 90's. I was wrong.

What I saw was the first TV anime I can call flawless. Thanks to the superb 2D/3D CGI animation by Production I.G. (similar to what Gonzo Studios did with the anime landmark Blue Submarine No. 6), the utterly amazing english voice cast, original and un-cliched storyline and the funky techno soundtrack, IGPX has made it to my all-time favorite anime collection, sitting alongside Miyazaki. The only recorded IGPX episode I have is the promotional DVD that came with my Nintendo Power magazine, and I can't wait to get my hands on the uncut version.",1136678400,2,847,4.6466666666666665
8096292,5,B000C8STTY,"IGPX (Immortal Grand Prix) is a huge international accomplishment. It's proof that the world is expanding, that Americans in particular are expanding, and that the tolerance for anime is increasing. Toonami and Production I.G. teamed up to make Toonami's first original anime, and there can't be any better team to have done this. Toonami has been doing everything in their power for years to spread the anime craze in the United States, and they are one of the top reasons why anime is what it is today. Production I.G., one of the top studios in Japan, the producers of Ghost in the Shell, GitS: Stand Alone Complex, GitS: Innocence, Blood and the future Blood+, as well as having contributed to Kill Bill V. 1, have as good a resume as can be found.

IGPX ranks well in terms of quality right alongside some of those series and movies stated earlier. The animation here is fluid, so fluid in fact that a couple of times I thought I was watching a real live person. The CG mixes well with the 2D animation, and no studio I thought has ever done it as well as Gonzo, but IGPX is one example of doing it just as well if not better. Toonami and Bandai played its part as well by providing some of the absolute best voice-actors possible, including Michelle Rodriguez, Haley Joel Osment, and Mark Hamill, not to mention those veteran anime voices that can be found in all the top Americanized anime, Spike's voice-actor for one; I only wish I could remember his name.

The story itself centers around a young IGPX team known as Team Satomi, whose sponsor of the same name seems to be the only person to keep the immature heads together. At the opening of the first episode, the team is qualifying for IG1, the top league in the IGPX circuits. Yet the teams immaturity constantly threatens to break them apart. Rarely are the three team members (and one bench warmer) together without getting into a fight. I wish I had seen more of the series to say more good things about it, but maybe that's a good thing, to prevent spoilers.

I will say that this anime should be watched, and bought, by all true anime fans out there. It may be one of those ""mainstream"" animes, but it's a very important anime, as it perhaps hints at a bright future for American and Japanese animation. I highly recommend this DVD. It shouldn't be missed.

(Like my reviews for ""Hikaru No Go,"" ""Gankutsuou,"" and ""Ghost Stories,"" this review is based off of the first episode of IGPX)",1135987200,6,2453,4.555555555555555
