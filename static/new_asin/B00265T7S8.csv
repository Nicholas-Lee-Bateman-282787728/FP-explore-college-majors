8351973,2,B00265T7S8,"I am afraid I will have to respectfully disagree with those reviewers who rate this good or even standable.  I gave it every generous chance possible, finally deciding on two stars rather than one.  After all, I hate to knock a production simply on taste, when all participants are competent in their respective fields.

That all said, I personally am grateful I was not introduced to opera in general, or to Prokofiev, or to the Love of Three Oranges in particular, by this video.  If I had been, I'm afraid I would have been turned off to the entire genre permanently.

I admit I am swayed by a stunning production I saw over 30 years ago, from what will probably be thought an unlikely source, that is the Arizona Opera.  It was so enjoyable that I attended not once but twice that week in 1982, coincidentally the same year this Glyndebourne production was recorded.  It's really too bad it was Glyndebourne's that was saved for posterity rather than Arizona Opera's, which of course was utterly unknown on the global scale, therefore not even eligible to be utterly forgotten now.

I am also swayed by another similarly unexpectable source for the past 30 years, that is the Melodiya (via Musical Heritage Society) LP set done in Russian.  So overall this is one of my very favorite operas of all time.  I was very much looking forward to seeing this highly recommended version on video as well ... but alas, came away dismayed on every attempt.

So never minding the memories and competition, let us focus on this particular production under review.  As mentioned, the musicianship of the singers and orchestra is not under question.  However, the orchestra is so small, so tiny, so tinny, recorded so far distantly in the background, it prompted another reviewer to state something to the effect the opera was ""ho-hum and without any startling dissonance"" etc.  This is so far from what Love of Three Oranges should be (a biting, virtuosic orchestral extravaganza as much as anything), it is without doubt the fault of the recording rather than the reviewer.

The entire recording, video and audio, is primitive.  One may dismiss it as 1982 technology, but let me assure anyone that was not around then ... 1982 had beautiful, crisp video and audio if any reasonable effort was made.  It was an exciting time for classical record collectors.  I was not only a collector but also worked in classical record retail at the time.  'Digital LPs' had been out a year or two already and 'Compact Discs' were just around the corner, eagerly anticipated and the center of every conversation in the store.  No, 1982 was definitely not the era of crappy audio.

Another thing I do not like is the blue-screen effects.  Now, those are primitive.  For example during the famous March, the courtiers are toting the Prince around a make-believe cartoon scenario in primitive, fuzzy blue screen.  Now, obviously, the live audience cannot see any blue screen effects, and I expect the video to record and transmit the art happening on stage, not to get involved with the art and replace the stage.

But what absolutely kills this production is the costume and set design, and I say that with full awareness of the blasphemy against the beloved Maurice Sendak.  Since his Magic Flute was justly well-received, not to mention all his other justly famous life endeavors, one might think Love for Three Oranges would also be ideal for his sendup.  No, I am sorry, it does not work here.  With all respect, it just looks like Maurice Sendak, not Love for Three Oranges.

If you need specifics, here are a few.  The costumes are so huge and outlandish (particularly the hats), that one cannot usually even see the singer's faces.  Worse yet, the singers are often wearing masks, dreadfully ugly masks with long noses.  I would much prefer to see the singers' faces, even in heavy makeup if you must.  And the stated setting of the French Revolution seems rather pointless.  One may as well set Star Wars in the French Revolution, throwing in a few imperial storm troopers to mingle with the powdered wigs.  I could go on ... the witch here (or rather, I should say the cook) is a gigantic puppet.  If you look at the cover art of this DVD, that huge puppet face looking down on the people--that is the cook.  NOW you will know whether this production is for you.  I wish it were for me, but it ain't.

I will be reviewing the Nagano / Lyons production shortly.  In the meantime, I could not recommend this Glyndebourne production even if there were no competition.

Submitted respectfully by a long-time fan of Glyndebourne in general, and of Love of Three Oranges in particular.",1401321600,4,4663,4.735732009925559
8351974,3,B00265T7S8,Great concept and of course beautiful designs. But I found the orchestra a little ho-hum about the whole thing. There's a kinda suppressed feeling to the score.... the dissonance isn't explosive and the lyrical/love themes seem muted.,1389830400,,234,5.351351351351352
8351975,4,B00265T7S8,This was recorded in 1982 and released on laser disc at the time. DVDs have been a long time coming. Of course the sound and picture show its age but the performance is very special and it is still my favourite of all the other DVD and Blu-ray releases on the market. Quite delightful and one quickly forgets its (not very serious) technical limitations.,1349740800,3,354,4.546875
8351976,5,B00265T7S8,"This is probably the only production where we finally get the true flavour of this great 'bolshevik' work. It's an in your face, gut wrenching parody of everything that wrong with Opera, Art and the people who pay to keep it the way it is.  I saw it in French on the DVD version and have bought several copies for friends (including academics, performers from the Met, and just crazy old folks who love opera).  S. Prokofiev is one of my  favorite composers and I am very demanding. I heard him perform his 3rd Piano Concerto and expect that level of effort. With this performance you get the 'industrial' background 'noise' of Dziga Vertov and the symphonic genius of the late 19th Century Russians (actually Ukraine) and the humour of Nu Pogodi. What more could you ask for.  Thanks Amazon!  :-D",1348185600,6,797,4.624113475177305
