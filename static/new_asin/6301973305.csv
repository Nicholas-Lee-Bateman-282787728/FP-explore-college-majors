She plays a great roll, the whole way through, while never letting her audience down.  She's witty, talented, flutatious, funny, beautiful, critising, and over all magical in this film.  You won't regret having this classic in your home forever.",991612800,4,345,4.913793103448276
410241,4,6301973305,"This is an overly long melodrama, utterly dated and in desperate need of an editor's scissors. Yet the performances of Bette Davis and the incomparable Claude Rains transform it into quite a good film, worth  buying.
Bette is perfectly cast as the vain and self-absorbed heroine  who eventually loses her looks and learns some humility as old ages crashes  in on her. Rains is pathetically sad as her hen-pecked husband who adores  her in vain. Their scenes together are brilliant. For anyone who thinks  today's crop of stars is anything special, do yourself a favor and sample  Bette Davis and Claude Rains, two masters!",964224000,7,622,4.9326923076923075

410245,4,6301973305,"Bette Davis plays a beautiful New York socialite with ""every man in New York at her feet"".  Many, many men are interested in marrying her.
And what does she do?  She marries a rich, Jewish stockbroker, Job  Skeffington (Claude Rains) for his money.  It is only at the end of the  film (after thirty years of countless beaus) that she realizes that Mr.  Skeffington was the only man that really and truly ever loved her.
There  is a much humor in the film including a wonderful running joke about one of  Fanny's best friends whom we never meet because Fanny always cancels lunch  dates with her.
The script was brilliantly written by the Epstein  brothers who co-wrote an earlier Davis hit, MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER as well  as one of the greatest films of all time-CASABLANCA.
The film begins in  the year 1914 just before the beginning of World War I and ends during the  midst of World War II.  We see Claude Rains after returning from a German  concentration camp and this was one of the first time American audiences  were able to get just an inkling of the horrors of the Nazis and their  anti-semitic practices.
The fade-out scene is one you'll not forget  easily.  Be sure to have that box of tissues handy.

Not for love, but because of his wealth and how he can help her brother, whom she loves beyond reason.  Mr. Skeffington loves her and has the patience to wait while she dangles men on a string.  Men who flatter her and appeal to her vanity.  Ultimately, her lack of reciprocation of that love causes the dissolution of the marriage.

She contracts diphtheria and loses her facial beauty.  The hordes of men disappear from her  life, and she has to learn to live with herself.  She ultimately finds her way back to Job Skeffington and learns what love really is.

410453,4,6301973305,"Bette Davis was a fearless actress, taking roles of unlikable and even fairly evil women instead of the tried and true love interest role that went to prettier young actresses who didn't want to jeopardize their careers. But Bette knew that a good villainess was worth a dozen wilting violets and never hesitated to show her dark side. Here her character, Fanny Trellis, is unlikable rather than evil, a vain and silly woman whose only interest is her attractiveness to men and keeping her inept brother out of trouble. Neither seems to have grown in maturity beyond nineteen and Fanny's lesson is a long overdue and when it comes, remarkably cruel. She does learn in the end and along the way gets to act the usual wide range of emotions that she was known for. Along with Bette we get the superb Claude Rains who never turned in anything but a top notch performance and is excellent here as Job Skeffington.

This is a very good film and i like it very much but for me it is not quite in the league with Now Voyager, Dark Victory or All About Eve. Fanny Trellis is always presented as a vain and unpleasant airhead and I can never drum up any sympathy for her. I know it should not be necessary to like or root for a central character, but this character, who lacks intelligence and charm, I find a total zero. Then there is Bette Davis' performance. She could assume mannerisms at times and here she affects an odd and grating voice and manner of talking that takes its toll, considering she is the focus of nearly every scene. Finally, the choice of Bette Davis to play Fanny was an odd one for Warner Brothers. Fanny isn't supposed to be just charming but such a radiant beauty that men constantly swarm around her and constantly propose to her. Her incredible beauty is, in fact, her only quality, and her vanity the source of her downfall. In other words, her beauty is the source of the entire plot, and I just can't see her as all that beautiful. She had character, yes. What is considered beauty changes over time, true. But I don't think Bette Davis would ever be the ravishing beauty the character is supposed to be in this film. I realize this is very subjective and others may feel differently. Warner's originally chose Merle Oberon for the role but she turned it down.

Bette does her best and in the end I went along with her because her acting is that good, but it would have been a much more comprehensible film if the beauty angle had been toned down a bit.",1470960000,4,2477,4.4657836644591615
410454,5,6301973305,Bette Davis is one of the best actresses to be on the silver screen.,1469577600,,68,3.9285714285714284
410455,4,6301973305,"Vincent Sherman's drama begins in the immediate pre-World War I years, where Fanny Trellis (Bette Davis) holds court in her chic New York house to a gaggle of male suitors. She does not intend to marry any of them; as the ultimate coquette, she has no need to. Her family are impoverished, due in no small part to the mismanagement of her brother Trippy (Richard Waring), who has squandered $24K at the racetrack and/or a series of bum deals. Fanny sees salvation by marrying Job Skeffington (Claude Rains) for his money. The film traces her life over the next two decades, where things don't quite turn out as she had envisaged.

Shot in deep focus by Ernest Haller, with stately production designs (by Robert Haas), MR. SKEFFINGTON creates an insular world representing Fanny's kingdom and her emotional prison. She enjoys being the center of attention at parties, or when her male suitors call (often in groups); but when age gets the better of her - due to the after-effects of diphtheria - she has nowhere else to go. The camera uses frequent aerial shots to depict her curio-stuffed morning-room and entrance-hall, as she moves listlessly between them, trying her best to avoid looking into the mirrors that show her facial degeneration.

Thematically speaking Sherman's film explores themes that would be developed in other Hollywood classics of the Forties. Fanny's obsession over her looks adumbrates Albert Lewin's THE PORTRAIT OF DORIAN GRAY, released a year later, while the notion of the woman imprisoned by her bourgeois New York life was explored to memorable effect in William Wyler's THE HEIRESS (1949).

What distinguishes Sherman's film is Davis's bravura performance as Fanny. She is required to age over twenty years, and does so with a combination of vocal brilliance and gestural variety, aided by excellent make-up (by Perc Westmore). She gradually transforms herself from youthful coquette into middle-aged flirt, consorting with local racketeer McMahon (Robert Shayne), into a lonely old crone sitting Miss-Havisham-like, abandoned by everyone including her daughter Fanny (Marjorie Riordan), and with only her maid Manby (Dorothy Peterson) for company.

Despite the seriousness of subject, the script - by the Epstein brothers - contains some memorably witty sequences. When Fanny goes to see the psychiatrist Byles (George Colouris), Byles gives her a hard time by reminding her that he must give her sufficient advice to warrant the extremely high fee he will charge. In another sequence, Mr. Skeffington's secretary gives as good as she gets in the delivery of put-downs, and for once renders Davis speechless.

The ending of this rather long movie (146 minutes) is perhaps a little too sentimental for what has previously proved a hard-edged viewing experience, but we have to remember that at the time of its release, the United States was still engaged in World War II. Thus it seems somehow appropriate that the script should take the opportunity to denounce the Nazis for their ill-treatment of Skeffington.

Characterized as a ""woman's picture,"" despite the title, MR. SKEFFINGTON is a thoroughly absorbing experience illuminated by a clutch of memorable performances.",1469318400,,3204,5.223735408560311

410516,5,6301973305,"I liked a lot this 1944 drama, which I never even heard of until recently. It is a long film, but I enjoyed every single minute of it. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

It begins in 1914. Fanny Trellis (Bette Davis) is a popular girl, considered a beauty, with many suitors. She and her brother Trippy (Richard Waring) went through most of their inheritance and albeit not poor, are not exactly rich any more. Things are made worse by Trippy's immaturity, lack of responsibility and sense of entitlement and quite early in the film Fanny decides to seduce a rich Jewish stockbroker, Job Skeffington (Claude Rains), to be able to sustain her lifestyle - and also pay off various (and numerous) Trippy's debts. This film is the story of this long and troubled relationship.

This is a serious drama, with quite a lot of heartbreak and tragedy, but it also contains considerable humour and a lot of witty dialogs. Human beings are studied in detail and they are shown with frank honesty, but also with understanding. Tough businessman Skeffington is also largely helpless in the hands of a vixeny, unscrupulous and even a little sadistic woman. Trippy is mostly a waste of oxygene - but in most charming, seductive way... There are also other, secondary characters, quite well shown, but I will not say much about them - you deserve to discover them by youself.

The most important character in the film is, against what we could expect from the title, Fanny herself. She is a mixture of brilliant intelligence and mind-numbing stupidity, she is superficial, selfish, spoiled, immature and as vain as Satan himself. Still, because of her personality and (according to the scenario) also her looks she is irresistible - and she will remain such for a long, long time. This is not a pleasant character - but definitely a fascinating one.

As I said, I liked this film a lot and I am very glad that I discovered it. One thing however bothered me - according to the story, Fanny is a great beauty, in fact a fascinating, irresistible one. Well, in my personal, purely objective perception, Bette Davis was not beautiful. She was a great actress, she was a very intelligent woman, she had megatons of personality, there was not even one ounce of common or plain in her, she was not ugly (far from it) and there was something rather fascinating about her (the French would say ""elle avait du chien"") - but beautiful she was NOT. She was not the first choice for the role of Fanny - but Merle Oberon and Hedy Lamarr, both amazingly beautiful wome, turned it down, scared probably by the villainous undertones of the character. Only then Bette Davis was selected, as it was known since ""Jezebel"" that she was not afraid of any role. Still, she was probably not the best choice and that for me is the one and only one false note in an otherwise amazingly good film.

This one thing notwithstanding, this is a very, very good, profound and tense drama. I liked it a lot, I am very happy that I bought the DVD and it is definitely a keeper. ENJOY!",1445212800,,3059,4.6469500924214415

410734,4,6301973305,"I loved reading ""Mr. Skeffington""  by Elizabeth Von Arnim--simply a juicy little masterpiece. Before I realized there was a film, I wondered how it could possibly translate to a movie. As it turns out, it could not--as it was written--because so much of it was about what went on in Fanny's head.  But even though the movie wandered quite far from the book in many ways, I still enjoyed seeing how Bette Davis handled the role. Some think it was bad acting but I don't agree. My impression is that Bette lacked the classical beauty of Fanny so the role necessitated that she acted with an ""over coquettish"" approach.  Certain details in the movie that had been changed seemed a bit unnecessary, but were probably devices to pull it together. Fop example, Trippy's embezzlement was not in the book and Fanny never had a child. Also, Fanny's suitors in the book all seemed to be desirable and handsome in their younger days with only one of them being clownish.  Unfortunately, in the movie, almost all of her suitors except for one, and of course Mr. Skeffington, were buffoonish.  So, read the book first, by all means, and then watch the movie. They're both great in their own way.",1391385600,2,1182,4.663461538461538

410778,5,6301973305,"It's funny, I've always liked watching Bette Davis, but remembered ""Mr. Skeffington"" as an overlong and boring movie. Then recently, I got on a roll of watching all her films and finally there was nothing left to watch but ""Mr. Skeffington""--surprisingly, it turns out to be one of her most entertaining performances (despite her exasperating character) and one of the easiest Davis films to watch over and over again (I like to watch movies I'm familiar with to fall asleep to when I have insomnia, so am constantly on the lookout for movies with re-watchability).

Yes, she plays a self-centered character, although not a truly ""bad"" one. Beautiful, vain Fanny is just so encouraged by suitors and admirers that quite simply, she never has sufficient motivation to question whether or not she is remiss as a human being. After all, everyone thinks she is so wonderful as she is, so why change anything? And although she has money trouble at the beginning of the picture (easily solved by marrying the wealthy Mr. Skeffington) she never falls on hard enough times financially to bring out the grit and texture of whoever she might be underneath all that vanity.

Even Mr. Skeffington (Claude Raines) who--playing an intelligent and insightful man--really should know better, fails to illuminate her as to her humanitarian shortcomings. He goes ahead and marries her when he knows full well she does not love him. Why? His answer is telling toward the message of the movie. Because he couldn't resist getting to be the one who ""married the woman everyone else wanted."" So even Mr. Skeffington admits to a level of vanity that--like Fanny herself later on--he will end up paying dearly for.

The movie spans three decades and ping-pongs somewhat between the genres of effervescent drawing-room comedy and a sort of sad drama with a moral (""A woman is beautiful only when she is loved). Some reviewers have noted that they would have preferred ""Mr. Skeffington"" confine itself to the drama, but I think the movie would have been a far too punishing experience for the audience without a steady supply of comic relief. Without it, seeing her break Claude Raines' heart over and over again (as well as her neglected daughter's) would have been unpalatable, in my opinion. What's more, the comedic undertones do nothing to lessen the impact of the pathos.

Humor is also necessary as a plot device to help explain Fanny's charm (since Davis--despite the make-up man's best efforts--is hardly so beautiful in the early scenes that men would pursue her to the extent they do in the script, which goes so far as to have scorned lovers committing suicide over her!). In fact, one recurring line of Fanny to her husband is, ""I always have the feeling you're laughing at me, and I find that attractive."" It's easier to love those who exasperate us when they also amuse us. And Fanny--despite her narcissism--is an amusing character. Vapid she may be, but she is not witless. In fact, aside from her total ignorance of world events (she manages to ignore two world wars) she is rather astute and perceptive, her witty dialog one-offs are subtle but constant reminders that this lady is no dummy. Just very, VERY self involved.

So it becomes understandable why Job (yes his name is Job--he's patient, get it?) might love a woman who cannot love. She is, after all, a prize--the woman that every other man wanted to possess, she is beautiful, and she is funny enough that when her assets are combined, it's possible to believe that even an intelligent man could be hooked by her. Fanny's latent capacity for generosity, loyalty and love is also established early in the film via her devotion to troubled brother Trippy. It is suggested that this part of Fanny's personality is not absent but merely stunted, and has the capacity for development. The question is, will the necessary constellation of events occur in order to awaken it before the film's end?

The film has more than one scene that made me cry. One is the ending, and the other is a restaurant scene between Mr. Skeffington and his daughter Fanny--both due to the beautiful sensitivity of Claude Raines' acting. Bette may provide this film with most of its fireworks, but Raines gives it the pathos that elevates it to a human drama and not just a slightly unpleasant screwball comedy.

You'll have to watch the movie through to the end to see whether or not Fanny--or Mr. Skeffington, for that matter--learn their respective lessons. But I guarantee you'll have fun watching this handsomely produced, ""in-between-the-genres"" film that finds Bette Davis playing delightfully off-type.",1388707200,2,4635,4.919437340153452

410786,3,6301973305,"Loosely based on a novel by Elizabeth von Arnim, MR. SKEFFINGTON was widely admired in 1944, most particularly so for Bette Davis' performance, which garnered yet another Academy Award nomination.  Seen today, however, the film is both strange and strangely uneven.

Fannie Trellis (Davis) is the most beautiful and fascinating New York socialite of 1914.  Unfortunately, her brother Trippy (Richard Waring) has scammed a significant amount of money from his employer, a Jewish stockbroker named Job Skeffington (Claude Raines.)  Fanny manouvers Job into marrying her in order to prevent him from pressing charges against Trippy--but her brother, who is presented as a covert anti-semite, despises the marriage and goes to Europe, where he is killed in World War I.  Fannie, now pregnant with a child she does not want and married to a man she does not love, declares that she has thrown her life away for nothing.  The stage is thus set for a series of domestic, marital, and romantic entanglements as Fannie becomes increasingly vain with every passing year.

Bette Davis was not classically beautiful, but she makes a stunning impression as the young Fannie Trellis.  Unfortunately, she is not quite able to hold onto that same effect as the film progresses, and while Fannie is an attractive woman it becomes difficult to accept her as a woman so beautiful that people stop and stare whenever she enters a room.  Her performance is also highly mannered, affected to such a degree that it becomes significantly wearing.  Davis recovers herself toward the end of the film, when an illness costs Fannie her good looks and forces her to face the fact that she has lived a shallow life.  Wearing make-up that anticipates her later turn in WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE, Davis has moments of greatness in this part of the film, moments that compare well with the best of her work.

But there is no getting around the fact that the overall film is a very strange sort of thing.  The script is very odd, at times a character study, at times a romantic drama, at times a screwball comedy, and the actors and director never manage to make the elements blend well.  Claude Raines was among the great screen actors of his era, but even he seems faintly ridiculous as he struggles with awkward dialogue about the difficulties of a mixed marriage and the hazards of living in Europe where anti-semitism is commonplace.  Perhaps most unfortunate is Marjorie Riordan, who plays the Skeffington child as an adult; after playing a number of scenes in a sympathetic manner, the actress is suddenly called upon to play a brutal scene in which she walks out on her mother after announcing she is going to marry one of Fannie's former lovers.  The supporting cast seems to strain with inconsistencies as they try to leap from style to style and genre to genre, and the overall film has a wildly inconsistent quality.

Even so, even with all these faults, MR. SKEFFINGTON is an unexpectedly watchable film, even when we laugh at it, and even when it goes over the top to conclude on a note of sentimentality that is not anticipated by the film as a whole.  And while Davis lacks the sheer beauty to carry off the role, and her mannerisms are excessive, but herself is strangely fascinating in this truly bizarre mishmash of awkward script and peculiar performances.  The DVD includes an interesting audio commentary by the director and a documentary on the film.  Not among Davis or Rains' finer films, no, but recommended if only for the strangeness of it.

There could have been numerous suitors without it descending into farce. The fact that Fannie is a silly foolish woman could be established less heavy handedly. Later on the movie gets better and the ending is very moving. It is certainly not one of her better movies but that is the fault of the script not in her performance. I would  have thought that she would have ""put her foot down"" so to speak about all the stupidity in the first part of the movie. Even later on when she is obviously older but still ""holding court"" with numerous suitors was played too much for comedy.

410921,5,6301973305,"I love this movie. Granted, this one will never go down as one of the greatest films of all time. However, it is entertaining and is populated with a good supporting cast with Bette Davis and Claude Rains setting the tone and driving the plot and what a plot it is.
Bette is Fannie Trellis of the New York Trellis'.  Swamped with beaus dear Fannie is truly the belle of the ball and the darling of society. The only cloud on the horizon is that the Trellis money has evaporated and Fannie's brother Trippy has taken to embezzling funds from his employer Jobe Skeffington. Jobe, as it turns out, is a self-made man who is not only not a wasp but a Jew. When Tippy faces prosecution, Fannie lays on the charm and not only saves Trippy from a jail cell but also restores the family fortune by marrying Jobe. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but Jobe is really a nice man who actually loves Fannie and Fannie has very few redeeming qualities save her love for Tippy. Maybe it's not Fannie's fault, but she is so self-absorbed with her youthful charisma and good looks that she has no time for Jobe and as he puts it she treats the dog better.
What transpires is a series of vignettes. Eventually Jobe and Fannie divorce and Fannie goes through a series of boyfriends. She ages but miraculously still looks good while everyone around her ages and matures. Problem is Fannie remains as flighty and self absorbed as ever. It is only after things catch up with Fannie that she learns the meaning of real love and compassion and kindness.
Davis tears through this role with gusto. Rains manages a controlled performance as the often abused Jobe. There are gems of scenes such as when Fannie loses her curls and when her former boyfriends literally salivate in wide eyed anticipation of seeing her for the first time in 2+ decades and then are confronted with reality.
As for makeup, there is a major revelation here. Two decades before Whatever Happened to Baby Jane the viewer gets to see her Baby Jane makeup. Talk about creepy. Unfortunately, Davis morphed into the old Fannie Trellis as she aged.
This film has a lot going for it. The script is good and the score by Franz Waxman elevates this movie.",1342742400,2,2204,4.551637279596977
410922,5,6301973305,"It is unbelievable that this movie was made in 1944.  The transfer is absolutely breath taking, it's as if it was playing in a theatre only  yesterday.

Bette Davis has never played a bigger bitch, self absorbed, narcisstic, thinking only of herself and her vain
youth trying deperately to hang on to every strand of her looks to attract men.

Claude Raines should have received an Academy Award for is performance as the husband that was married only for his money and then cast aside like kleenex.  I don't think there is a performance out there that could compare with the performance he gave in this film.

Altho the years have past, you can see why Davis was the star that she was and she was a STAR of all STARS.

There is a scene between Mr. Skeffington and his young daughter, who has already realized that her mother cares nothing about her.  Fannie (Davis) has filed for divorce and has realized that she will be stuck with the daughter according to law and has asked Skeffington is this true? He confirms that is usually the way the law works.

Fannie ask that Skeffington deals with this.  She suggest he take his daughter out to dinner and explain the ins and out of divorce.  Skeffington ask that she wear her blue organza because she so looks like her mother.

In the restaurant Young Fannie begs then pleads with her father to let her live with him.  She will do anything just to live with him, anything.  Raines interpretation of this scene between him and the daughter is beyond anything I have ever witnessed on the screen.  The man was a genuis at acting.

410925,4,6301973305,"Bette Davis is the frivolous ""wealthy"" socialite Fanny Trellis. Men literally throw themselves at her feet for just a whiff of her attention. Her life is carefree until she learns that her brother has squandered their inheritance. Their wealth is a finally crafted facade.
Betty Davis is full swing again with a character similiar to her starring role in JEZEBEL. Fanny is a woman who uses to her beauty to win the affections of men without any regard for love or feelings. It doesn't matter whose feelings are hurt or crushed. Claude Rains appears and the kindly and elegant Mr. Skeffington. For some reason, he genuinely falls in love with Fanny. His offer of marriage will save the Trellis home and let Fanny keep living a life of wealth and splendor. Sadly, the new Mrs. Skeffington might be fond of her husband but there is no love match.
Fanny's story unravels in a movie lasting almost 2 1/2 hours. This is an epic without much of the grandeur of other epics. It is a story of a woman and the lives she ruins--not the least the life and dreams of her loving husband. Even after having a lovely daughter, Fanny does not change and motherhood is not for her.
Fanny breezes well into middle-age and somehow her beauty stays frozen in time until an illness changes everything. Here is the meat of the story. How does a once famed beauty deal with her loss of looks? Here is where the charming line Mr. Skeffington told her so many times comes into play - ""A woman is beautiful when she is loved."" Her life has been spent thinking she is loved because of her beauty.
As in JEZEL, we see Betty Davis as a raving beauty that men cannot resist. According to the bonus feature, MR. SKEFFINGTON: A PICTURE OF STRENGTH, Davis hesitated to take this role knowing she was not ""right"" for the part of Fanny Trellis. Although attractive in a special way, Davis was not a classic beauty and she was aware of that. Warner executives assured her she could be made to look even more enchanting through make-up, costumes and lighting. Somehow we can see the transformation.

Directed by Vincent Sherman

The incomparable Bette Davis and the always-charming Claude Rains, in one of those good, solid melodramas - they make quite a marvelous screen pair, both pros from the old school of acting. Their voices, accents, speech patterns are classic, also mesmerizing in this film.

""Mr. Skeffington"" is a classic. The film is over two hours, it keeps your interest and a worthwhile film to see. It also features excellent performances by Walter Abel, George Coulouris, and Marjorie Riordan.

Nominated Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Claude Rains), Best Actress in a Leading Role (Bette Davis)

Another in a long list of wonderful melodramas, ""Mr. Skeffington"" is a very good classic film that I fear has been forgotten throughout the years. Its performances and adequately compelling story are enough to recommend it to classic film lovers, particularly those who are fans of Bette Davis or Claude Rains.

* Special Footnote: -- Bette Davis was not the first choice for the role of Fanny. The part was first offered first to Merle Oberon and then to Hedy Lamarr who both turned it down.

** Another Special Footnote: -- Bette Davis' final Oscar-nominated performance while under contract with Warner Brothers.

410982,3,6301973305,"""Mr. Skeffington"" is another one of those 40s films that is absorbed with the life and times of the wealthy  - e.g., ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), ""King's Row"" (1942), ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1943), etc.  Skeffington is a 1944 film concerned with life among the wealthy from 1914 to 1940. It's a tour d'force for Bette Davis and Claude Rains, and includes excellent supporting performances from Walter Abel, Richard Waring, John Alexander, Jerome Cowan, Peter Whitney, and Bill Kennedy.

Bette Davis is a film icon. She appeared in nearly 100 films, was nominated for an Oscar 11 times and won twice (""Dangerous"" in 1935 and ""Jezebel""  in 1939), nominated for an Emmy 4 times and won once (""Strangers"" in 1979), 3 Golden Globe Nominations, and for ""All About Eve"" (1950) she won awards at Cannes, in Italy,  and the New York Film Critics. According to AFI she is the #2 female screen legend . Some reviewers have commented on Davis' ""beauty"" in relation to the story, but IMHO I think she pulls it off. Being an eligible young woman has more to do than the simple physical appearance of her face, and Davis' face is attractive enough to make the film believable.

Claude Rains was one of the greatest actors of the 20th century and a personal favorite of his co-star, Bette Davis. He appeared in only a few dozen films, but was nominated 4 times for an Oscar (""Notorious"" in 1946, ""Mr. Skeffington"" in 1944, ""Casablanca"" in 1942, and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" in 1939) although many people remember him best for ""The Invisible Man"" (1933) or ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938). Rains plays Mr. Skeffington. His performance is a true example of less is more.

Walter Abel (1898-1987) appeared in more than 50 films, and is best known for his work on ""The Three Musketeers"" (1935) as D'Artagnan. He does an excellent job playing Davis' down to earth cousin.

Davis' persistent suitors form a sort of chorus. They are John Alexander, Jerome Cowan, Peter Whitney, and Bill Kennedy.

- Jerome Cowan (1897-1972) appeared in more than 100 films, remembered best for his roles as the DA in ""Miracle on 34th Street"", Dagwood's boss Mr. Radcliffe in the ""Blondie"" series (1938-43), and Bogart's partner Miles Archer from ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941).

- Peter Whitney (1916-72) appears much younger, smaller, and far tamer in this film than he did in the 100+ films in which he was a huge, strong, and generally dull presence with bushy eyebrows. We know him best from his omnipresence on TV in the 60s when he appeared in just about every Western on TV with names like ""Moose"", ""Big Bill"", ""Fat Augie"", and ""The Giant"".

- John Alexander (1897-1982) is best known for playing Teddy Roosevelt in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944), one of 30 films in which he appeared.

- Bill Kennedy (1908-97) appeared in more than 50 films, but it's his distinctive voice that you'll recall. Among other roles, he was the announcer for the TV series ""Superman"" (1952-8)

Vincent Sherman (1906-2006) directs. He began a love affair with Bette Davis in 1943 (""Old Acquaintance"") and it continued through the filming of Mr. Skeffington. Sherman followed Davis with Joan Crawford, making ""Baby Jane"" a little more understandable. Though he made films with Bogart (""Return of Dr. X"", ""All Through the Night"", ""Across the Pacific""), his good friend Errol Flynn (""Adventures of Don Juan""), Clark Gable (""Lone Star""), etc., he is generally known as a ""woman's director.""Sherman was investigated by HUAC in the 50s, which ended his film career and he made the transition to TV where he worked on series such as ""The Waltons"", ""Baretta"" and ""77 Sunset Strip"".

Julius and twin brother Philip Epstein co-wrote and co-produced. They're best known for ""Casablanca"" (1942) for which they won the Academy Award and also were nominated 3 more times - in 1938 (""Four Daughters""), 1973 (""Pete n'Tillie""), and 1984 (""Reuben, Reuben""). My favorite Epstein film is ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"" (1942), in which Davis also appeared.

Ernest Haller (1896-1970) provides beautiful black and white photography. He filmed more than 100 movies and was nominated for an Oscar 7 times, three times for films with Bette Davis (""Jezebel"" in 1938, ""All This and Heaven Too"" in 1940, and ""Whatever Happened to baby Jane?"" in 1962), and won once for ""GWTW"" (1939).

Franz Waxman provides the score. Waxman was nominated for an Oscar 10 times and won twice (""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Sunset Blvd""). He was a favorite of Hitchcock who used him in 4 films and earned 2 of his Oscar nominations (""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion""). Waxman is generally not known for his comedies, having to his credit films like ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), ""Fury"" (1936), Captains Courageous"" (1937) etc. Nonetheless, I think the music adds to the film, which is perhaps not unlike his work on ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940).

The film is a strange blend of romance, comedy, and drama, not necessarily successfully mixed. This may be Sherman's fault, as we can see this same problem in his work on ""All Through the Night"" which begins as a fast paced comedy and transitions awkwardly into a spy flick. Skeffington, for the first 40 minutes or so, is a mildly amusing look at the social elite, but with the death of one of the central characters the film takes a dark turn from which it never emerges. There is a scene with a so-called Psychoanalyst that is very funny, by itself, but it comes bracketed by Davis' concern with her failing looks and as such seems out of place in what has otherwise turned into a drama.

The film is definitely worth a look for the performances of Davis and Rains, but there are better romances, better comedies, and better period pieces if that's what you're looking for.",1292803200,,5755,4.8491335372069315

410984,1,6301973305,"As Bosley Crowther wrote in his 1944 NY Times review, to enjoy ""Mr. Skeffington"" you have to accept the premise that Bette Davis is irresistible to men.  A marvelous actor, Ms Davis, and lovely, but not the sort of fabulous face that enthralls every man in the room or anchors a script about looks on looks alone, as Gene Tierney does in ""Laura"" or Rita Hayworth in ""Cover Girl.""  Bette Davis's beauty is more offbeat and idiosyncratic, and more charged by intelligence and danger - both conspicuously absent from ""Mr. Skeffington.""  Fanny is a vain shallow creature but the actor can't be; a good actor defends her character with nuance and development.  Here, in arguably the worst work I've seen a great actor deliver, Davis trivializes this trivial woman (and the film) in a dismally uneventful performance, brutally monotonous - there's not a drop of humanity in it.  Her lilting vocal affectation - a wincing clich the moment you hear it - never alters its rhythm or pitch, never softens or shades, never deepens or reveals, even down to the final scene when she holds her blind broken husband in her arms.  Apparently, beauty was Fanny's only asset, and that seems to suit the occasion of a film without any real men or women.  The suitors are simpletons, pure pastiche and impossible to believe.  The brother, whose criminal conduct and death in the war drive much of the plot, remains an unmotivated overwrought enigma that evokes no curiosity or compassion.  And Skeffington himself, the only intelligible performance in the movie (Claude Rains), undermines any credibility he might accrue by marrying a woman with nothing whatever to offer besides pride of possession.",1273276800,4,1679,4.94661921708185

Mr. Skeffington stars none other then the great Bette Davis in one her finest performances (she had many many more). The subject matter is also important because of it's important message,which still holds up strong in todays world where looks and youth often seem to matter more then even morality. Davis is Fanny Trellis,a tragic character if I ever saw one. This epic drama begins in 1914 just before the start of WW1 as Fanny,a New York social climber seeks the romantic attention of her swindling brother's boss Job Skeffington (Clause Rains),a wealthy banker who happens to be Jewish in order to get her brothers name cleared. Through the war the couple have a child and,while Skeffington himself is always aware she's not truely in love with him she dismisses it as him ""laughing at her"" on the inside. Skeffington is a likeable and a very sympathetic man who goes all out to show Fanny and their daughter,also named Fanny all the love and kindness he can. When Fanny's brother dies in the war,having gone because of her selfish ways,she blames-resulting in bitterness and6 infidenlity on both sides. In the end  the couple seek divorce. As with most cases like this,the daughter is torn but ends up traveling overseas to Europe with her father following the war. Of course once she is gone the elder Fanny is back to to her selfish,and frankly rather disrepretable ways. She only views her looks as a significant asset. When one such date results in diptheria Fanny's years catches up with her and she is left with an aged face. By this time it is during the second world war and Fanny is left to contend not only with her haunted memories of Job Skeffington but finaly by the man himself,blinded and in financial ruin after time in a Nazi concentration camp. The only thing is,while he still loves Fanny,the next part is where the movie gets reallllly interesting:Fanny's faded looks have deflated her ego and she finds she too really does love Mr. Skeffington and decides to be there for him. Yes,small justice for her ammoral behavior over the years but a fitting conclusion. This is a great story with tremendous acting on the part of everyone participating. In the end Claude Rains brilliant performance,reserved yet very warm makes you really like Job Skeffington. Even when,after Fanny's betrayal of his effections he resorts to extra marital affairs-it's only only time I ever sympathized with a movie character who did that. After all Fanny had been having ""suiters"" all through her marriage:men literally lined up to share her affections. At first one doesn't emphathize with Bette Davis's Fanny until the end,when you realize your dealing with a character who has become so consumed with her appearance that she forgot how to really love.

411009,4,6301973305,"Earning an eighth Oscar nomination, Bette Davis boldly owns this captivating ""women's picture"".  Playing a vain and self-centered beauty, Davis commands the screen in every possible way.

Fanny Trellis (Bette Davis), the darling of New York society, is penniless thanks to her weak-willed brother but enjoys a neverending string of male admirers traipsing through her Gramercy Park mansion.  When marriage finally comes, it's more of a business arrangement.  Although she's very fond of Job Skeffington (Claude Rains), Fanny will never settle down as the devoted little wife and mother.  Only after a middle-aged Fanny has suffered the ravages of diphtheria will she discover the true value of love over appearances.

Bette Davis was never afraid in playing unsympathetic characters, and in Fanny she found the perfect meaty role.  Layered with many shades, moods and colours, Fanny Skeffington wins hearts on and off the screen, despite her more tempestuous moments.  Not the most conventional screen beauty, Davis was concerned about playing a woman famous for her looks (Irene Dunne, Merle Oberon and Hedy Lamarr were all briefly considered for Fanny).  I can't imagine any of them being better than Davis.

I absolutely adore everything about MR. SKEFFINGTON, from it's lush period design to the bravura performance of Bette Davis, in what must have surely been one of her favourite roles.

Of course, the tragedy of people like Bette Davis' Mrs. Skeffington character is that, even if they did have a moment of clarity while still young and alluring, many still would choose the sweet, momentary pleasures instead of taking the time to build something more meaningful.

Ms. Davis has played the spoiled rich beautiful young woman before, as in Jezebel, and done it well, but the characters around her were written well also, and the costumes worked well, not so in Mr. Skefington.

The story is simply unbelievable.  Mr. Skefington, Claude Rains,  plays a proud man who came from a poor family, but because of his intellect and ability,  became a rich, smart and shrewed business man.  From that character, he is turned into a blitering idiot after he meets Bette.  He allows her to turn him into a weak and naive man without any strenght of character.  Also in this film, Bette's very high pitched voice, which got higher as she got older was nerve wracking.  This part was not for Ms. Davis or Mr. Raines.",1159142400,3,906,4.54320987654321

In fact, a more shallow actress might have made the character more interesting! Clothes and sets are fantastic, though. I will say this...she did convice me she was beautiful. One of my favorite scenes in a movie is her bursting through with ""George, George dahling!"" So fun to imitate!",1148169600,2,518,4.641304347826087
411058,4,6301973305,"Maybe this isn't quite Bette Davis's best film for Fox, but MR. SKEFFINGTON certainly has its pleasures, particularly in its excellent first half. Fanny Trellis is a charming, silly society beauty who adores her ne'er-do-well snobbish brother, the infelitiously named Tripppy Trellis. To save him from going to jail for embezzlement, she encourages the suit paid her by his wealthy self-made boss, Job Skeffington (superbly played by Claude Rains). Although Fanny likes Job very much and treats him mostly with kindness, she is incapable of loving anyone other than herself or Trippy, and she chastely encourages the continued attentions of her other society suitors; eventually Trippy's death drive Fanny and Job apart, until they are reconciled by picture's end.

Davis affecting a very charming and childike breathy voice to play Fanny, which wound up being one of her most memorable roles; although she is almost never consciously cruel, she brings great pain to her husband and to her daughter by her inability to love them. The film allows for great fashion-plate outfits for Davis from Orry-Kelly spanning the deacdes from 1914 to the time the film was made, although the costumnes (like the film itself) take a real downturn in the Roaring Twenties when Fanny is called upon to wear flapper outfits and visit speakeasies with gangsters. The film becomes tediously melodramatic in its later sequences when Fanny must be pushed by nemesis for being so vain and thus she contracts diphtheria, which ravages her face; although the makeup Davis then affects to make herself look old and ""dilapidated"" (Fanny's term) amusingly anticipates her infamous later look as Baby Jane Hudson,  she begins wearing ridiculously dowdy costumes with lace collars even though her character is supposed to be trying to pass as a beauty still. Naturally Hollywood demanded that Davis's Fanny not only be punished for being a abad mother and wife but that she also be redeemed: the final sequence with Fanny and Job reconciling is pretty hilariously over-the-top. Yet both Davis and Rains seem to surmount the material by giving genuinely affecting performances.",1147564800,2,2147,5.220289855072464
411059,4,6301973305,"Usually it was the acting of Bette Davis that made most of those melodramatic soapers she appeared in watchable, but she's not quite up to par in this one. She plays a narcisstic woman in love with her own beauty; every eligible bachelor around is after her. But she meets the rich (and Jewish) Caude Rains when he is about to prosecute her brother for defrauding him; Davis convinces him not to. Eventually they marry.

But it's a loveless match from the start, and they each find affection in the company of others. After years of this Davis decides to divorce him; Rains settles handsomely and goes to Europe - just in time to fall into the net of the Nazis. Davis flits around wherever her money will take her, until she contracts diphtheria and overnight turns into a Medussa. She's a lonely old hag now, but Rains comes back, blinded in a concentration camp - and because he can't see her, he thinks she's still beautiful. They reconcile.

A lot of the scenes and much of the dialogue are pretty snappy, especially early on. But Davis is just so cloying here and she so over-does that high-pitched, whiny voice that you just want to strangle her. The messages are loud and clear (life is a serious business, physical beauty isn't everything), and even the timely reminder that Hitler's Nazi's were brutal, especially to the Jews, is befitting and commendable in a 1944 movie. And Claude Rains is excellent. I just think the movie could have been better.",1130457600,3,1459,4.651162790697675

This movie is just excellent. Bette Davis stars as a cold woman who lives with her brother who she loves. She gets all of her self esteem from men trying to marry or get with her. Thats her only focus in life. She doesn't have the ability to love or really be loved. But, theres more to the story then this, she does marry Mr Skeffington and he ends up going to fight in the Holocoust. Bette ages a lot in the movie and she starts to realize her priorities were off.

411062,5,6301973305,"There was only one Bette Davis and this fine old film proves it: a splendid story of a Gramercy Park beauty who learns almost too late what love really is and how truly selfless it can be. Davis' performance is matched by Claude Rains as ""Mr. Skeffington"", a self made Jewish man of wealth whom the vain and beautiful Fanny Trellis marries for security, not love. Of course, Skeffington loves Fanny with all his heart and is constantly hurt by her patronizing affection for him. The story begins in 1914 New York and chronicles in epic form their marriage and the changing times around them, including WW1, until the present(1944). Davis does look beautiful as the young Fanny who holds her looks (and suitors whom Skeffington amusingly tolerates) over the years until divorce and tragedy strike and everything (including Fanny) changes. A very demanding role for Davis but she is amazing throughout and Orry-Kelly does wonders with her costumes. They're stunning, especially in the early years. A first class film all the way with first class performances and many funny sequences to offset the drama which never quite becomes maudlin. Rains and Davis are superb. The DVD is a fine print too which only heightens the enjoyment of this b&w classic. Directed by Vincent Sherman who helmed several films for Davis in the 40's and Joan Crawford. A collector's item, ""Mr. Skeffington"" is a welcome addition to the Davis films finally seeing DVD release.",1118966400,2,1449,4.942622950819672
411063,5,6301973305,"Vincent Sherman is generally underrated and people seem to prefer William Wyler as a director, but to me Sherman gives you the real 100 proof Bette Davis (as well as many other actresses he worked with during a very up and down career).  Wyler seems so labored next to Sherman's X-Ray intensity, like he's shooting the film lit only by occasional flashes of lightning.  MR SKEFFINGTON, with its teasing title, is one of his very best pictures.

Bette Davis evidently persuades about half the people watching the movie that she is or was a great beauty.  That's a sign of good acting, even if she can't sway the other fifty percent from thinking her a fraud.  Fanny is one of Davis' great creations, even if you don't buy into her beauty, for she makes you believe in her self-absorption, and the exquisite narcissism which draws men toward her like moths.  And yet Fanny has an Achilles heel of her own--two really, if you count the way her self-worth is totally indexed into her good looks, so it must inevitably suffer with the passing of time.  But her real weakness is her crazy love for her brother, the indolent character played by Richard Waring in this film, with the Cockettes-style name of ""Trippy Trellis.""  As many have noted, it's hard to take a guy seriously in the movie if his name is ""Trippy Trellis.""  Waring is good in the part, and I wonder why his US career was so curtailed.  Maybe it was the curse of that tremulous name.

As for Claude Rains, he lives up to the title role every bit as splendidly as he filled the shoes of ""The Invisible Man.""  There's a bit of the invisible in his performance, isn't there, in the way he retreats towards the wallpaper when Fanny takes every inch of air in the room.  And in fact he completely disappears off the screen while the death camps get a grip on him, only for him to make a fantastic Monte Cristo re-appearance at the end.  They don't make actors like that any more, do they?  Well, they do, but they don't give them their heads the way Vincent Sherman encourages Rains and Davis at every turn.  ""More, more, more!""  And also, of course, we don't have Franz Waxman working in Hollywood any more.  His delirious score for MR SKEFFINGTON makes ""Trippy Trellis"" seem almost reasonable.  Put this film on DVD now!",1110499200,19,2278,4.53921568627451
411064,4,6301973305,"""Mr. Skeffington"" is slow moving, especially if you are viewing the restored version with almost a full half hour added to what was shown in theaters.

The opening scene of Fanny Trellis' suitors kibbutzing in a receiving room seems to go on forever, with far too much dead air between the genuinely funny witticisms.

Too, Fanny and her suitors are too old to really capture the script's sense of a lusty crowd of marriageable-age aristocrats fighting over a prime beauty and her fortune. And Davis never really conveys that she *is* a great beauty. I've seen British actresses who aren't great beauties carry this off, but Davis doesn't.

But this film is still worth a look for mature film goers.

Claude Rains gives another tremendous, and understated, performance, the film's themes of sacrifice and inner v. outer beauty are genuinely poignant, and ""Mr. Skeffington"" is of historical interest because it was one of the first films to address anti-Semitism.

It is fascinating for a film-goer of our more ""let-it-all-hang-out"" era to see the trepidation with which anti-Semitism is discussed -- or, rather, *not* discussed. Whenever someone comes close to saying a word like ""Jew"" his or her line is cut short. When Claude Rains informs his daughter that it would be better for her to be raised by her unloving, but Gentile, mother, rather than her adoring, but Jewish, father, this viewer was moved to tears.

Too, the themes of inner beauty v. outer beauty are profound. They are echoed in the themes of anti-Semitism and of classism. The true ""gentleman"" of the piece is Job Skeffington, a short, coarse, low-born Jew. He brings out the beauty in his high-born wife.

His sacrifice in supporting her, and her sacrifice to save her brother, are also moving plot elements.

Davis is, as ever, flamboyant, and it is wonderful to watch Rains never, ever rise to her invitation to overact, especially in the scene in Skeffington's office, where Davis flutters away in fright from a stuffed eagle. Both the character, Fannie Trellis, and the actor, Bette Davis, in this scene are begging Job Skeffington / Claude Rains to overact, to be as histrionic and artificial as she is, but Rains never takes the bait. He depicts a hard-headed businessman with hard-headed acting chops that require no italics.

His lines on the boat after the wedding are also quite moving. He talks about why he married Fannie, and what his hopes are.

Finally this film is poignant because the plot is, as they say ""isomorphic to context."" Many Movie Moguls were low-born Jewish men who went out their way to capture high-born, beautiful, aristocratic, Gentile wives; they handed their children over to these wives and boarding schools and the wider culture in the hopes that their Americanized children would never experience the anti-Semitism that they had experienced.

If nothing else, this film can be enjoyed as a soap opera with high production values. The sets are lavish, and the plot moves through several decades, so one gets to enjoy the fashions of the teens through to the forties.",1100736000,3,3073,4.947572815533981
411065,5,6301973305,"I have seen Mr. Skeffington several times, and each time it amazes me.  I am really amazed that the Jew's place in society is addressed at all in a Hollywood movie, let alone so truthfully. It does not blare trumpets and call great attention to itself as does Gentleman's Agreement.  As a Jew, I find Gentleman's Agreement embarrassing for that reason; I find Mr. Skeffington revelatory and truthful.  There is not one false note.

In the same manner, Mr. Skeffington deals with several other difficult and complex subjects: a marriage that has to fail because Mrs. Skeffington is very narcissistic and self-involved; in addition, she has an underlying (perhaps subconscious) mild contempt for her husband because he is Jewish.  She is also an uninvolved mother.  As her husband says, she seems unable to love, and in the movie she is obsessed with being the object of love.

There is also a lovely child whose source of unconditional love and nurturance comes almost exclusively from her father.  During her parents' divorce, she very narrowly escapes being put into the custody of her un-caring parent and is raised by her father.

In addition to the first-class screenplay, directing, casting, and acting, I am very, pleased to see Claude Rains (one of my favorite actors, and someone whom I would like to champion because he has been underrated) play totally against type, showing us a side of hims never seen in any other role (as far as I am aware).  He plays a warm, sensitive, loving and nurturing husband and--and this is the most delightful--father.  He is wonderful on screen with his daughter, and totally believable as a man with a warm, caring heart.  In all Raines's roles there has been a tremendous vulnerability, and for once, in this role the vulnerability is sensitivity, warmth, and affection, There is also courage.  It is a relief to see him shed the scabrous mantle of stunted growth, frustration, freakiness, neurosis, depravity and decadence.",1100044800,4,1968,4.963414634146342

Seems to me all those beaus don't do a thing for her that she couldn't get from Claude Rains. In time though, fate deals a heavy hand, and Bette loses the very thing, and yet still carries on as though she hasn't. Very interesting movie.",1092873600,,602,4.153846153846154
411137,5,6301973305,"Yeah, I've seen Now Voyager and Baby Jane and All About Eve. I've actually seen most of Bette Davis's pictures (this was before I discovered Joan Crawford - if you like one, you'll probably like the other). Anyway, Mr. Skeffington is Bette's very best film. I say this because of the very impressive acting, production, and screenplay. There is some very powerful social commentary in this film - just as relevant today as 60 years ago, if not more. The main theme of the film is you are only beautiful if you are loved. Damned if this isn't the same theme of Madonna's latest album, American Life! Anyway, we follow the epic life story of a very rich, beautiful and selfish woman (Bette) as she willingly marries a man for his money and throws him and her daughter away afterward as if they never happened. Years pass and Bette loses all her ""beauty"" and the makeup is plastered on to make her look like Baby Jane (this is 20 years before Baby Jane, but the effect is the same)! She tries to pretend she is still young...and all her fake hair falls out and none of the men want her any more!  Then comes the great moment of catharsis, when Bette's daughter leaves and tells her that if somebody truly loved her, it wouldn't matter to them that she was now older (such a true statement and one of the best in the movie). I won't give the whole plot away, but the movie stands up because there are a lot of selfish people in our world today, not just women. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this movie would have been better with a real beauty like Joan Crawford, but she was off doing Mildred Pierce and whatnot. This movie really is a masterpiece, though, and it has a wonderful happy ending that will make you cry tears of joy!",1065139200,5,1734,4.335384615384616
411138,3,6301973305,"Whether you are going to enjoy or get into this film depends on a few factors.  First of all, you must believe that every man is tripping over himself to win the hand of the woman considered the most beautiful and desirable in New York, Bette Davis.  Now Davis was certainly attractive, but it's a real stretch to consider her that kind of once-in-a-lifetime beauty.  You must then be willing to spend two and a half hours watching a vain, self-centered woman use her beauty, abuse her family, and then try to find sympathy for her when irony deals her exactly what she deserves.  Obviously, I had some problems with this film.  It tells the story of Fanny Trellis who later becomes Fanny Skeffington, the object of every man's affections, who can't see beyond her own mirror to see the events of the world or the pain she causes others.  She marries Claude Rains for money and security for her family, but her marriage unravels and eventually so does her beauty.  The character of Fanny is not sympathetic, and I found it hard to get past that, although thankfully she does have a sense of humour, which helps.  Davis, using a higher pitched voice, doesn't shrink away from portraying Fanny as she is, and her appearance as the older Fanny is startling given how we know she aged in real life.  Rains is his excellent self as usual in this film, really capturing the heart of the story.  Not surprisingly, his absence from most of the last half of the film hurt it for me, as I found it long and badly in need of editing.  There are some good moments in the film, but since I found little to like in the central character, there wasn't much else except Rains to appreciate.",1042848000,11,1674,4.491749174917492
411139,3,6301973305,"From her first appearance as Fanny Trellis Skeffington, Bette Davis--never pretty--completely persuades the viewer that she is a great beauty. Claude Rains is patient and endearing as her beleaguered husband. But the movie is simply too long and suffers from seemingly endless repetition of its heavy-handed and offensive message: ""A woman is only beautiful when she is loved.""
At the end, when Fanny's beauty has at last eroded (due to illness, not a lack of affection from suitors, which seems to be something of a contradiction), she at last finds love for her long-suffering husband. But it's awfully convenient that she develops an appreciation for him only after he is blinded, and cannot what she looks like.
The Holocaust figures briefly but significantly in the movie. Although its horrors are never seen directly, the mention of concentration camps and Nazi brutality is noteworthy in a movie made in 1944. Apparently _somebody_ knew what was happening in Europe, and knew well enough to include it in a movie before the war had ended.",1029801600,9,1045,5.0813953488372094
411140,4,6301973305,"Fanny is a young and beautiful woman of the early 1920s who possesses enormous qualities of face and figure much admired by her many suitors.  Unfortunately, she also possesses a gigantic ego matched only by a blind spot to the feelings of others, a lack of basic empathy of which she is readily aware.  Bette Davis, in MR. SKEFFINGTON, cuts a stark image of the vain and silly socialite wanna-be who knows that her looks are the means to climb to the top of the social eating chain. This movie is more than a female version of the then popular 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps' story.  The bootstraps that Fanny uses are a formidable array of beauty aids, which when allied to a perfect pitch of tone and voice, make her irresistable to nearly every man she meets.  She dates many who see her only as the image she so carefully nurtures.  She turns down all of them except for an aging and wealthy financier, Mr. Skeffington, played superbly by Claude Rains, an actor who has made a career of playing the educated and glib second banana to the lead.  Here Rains is under no illusions about Fanny.  He is well aware that she is a totally unreliable flirt who seeks flattery the way most others seek food and drink. Yet, there is something that he does see within her that he likes, enough at any rate to fall in love with her and propose.  Fanny sees a rich old man whom she can control at will, so she accepts.  They marry and the marriage goes pretty much the way that he thought.  She continues her affairs, often right under his nose, yet he waits patiently for the loving woman he feels sure lurks somewhere in her soul.  He also waits for some affirmation of his own worth. He gets none.  The years pass, they have a daughter, also called Fanny, whom he adores, but she ignores.  The daughter Fanny exists only in her mother's mind as an inflexible reminder that time passes on, so the mother avoids her daughter at nearly every turn.  The inevitable happens.  Mr. Skeffington and wife divorce, with the wife eager to surrender custody of a daughter that she could easily have retained legal custody to.  The years pass, with father and daughter living in Germany and the elder Fanny continuing a circular existence of one meaningless affair after another.  Reality crashes her life as she is afflicted with diphtheria, ruining her looks. Her suitors fade, her daughter marries one of her mother's suitors, and Fanny is now thoroughly alone.  Those who criticize this movie point to the sudden moral regeneration of self that transforms Fanny in the last reel.  Mr. Skeffington appears on her doorstep unexpectedly, poor, blind, and broken in spirit from his time in one of Hitler's concentration camps. She is at first unwilling to see him, but she changes her mind, and when he trips over a hassock, she now can see him more clearly than in the past.  Her transformation of her inner self is more startling than the equivalent outer transformation from beauty to hag.  The physical transformation is unintentionally ironic in that Bette Davis in real life never was the ravishing beauty of Hollywood.  By the force of this true life person, she caused others to see her as a great beauty.  The Fanny character performed a similar trick on screen.  Her suitors saw her as desirable because she saw herself as one worthy of love based only on beauty.  As her looks faded due to disease, so did her confidence.  It is only the knowledge that she is loved that helps her regain her beauty.  The final scene when she leads a blinded husband to her servants and tells them, 'Mr. Skeffington has returned home,' can we see that true beauty is more a function of the heart and not the eye.  It simply took Fanny Skeffington a very long time to learn this.",1025913600,7,3759,4.586826347305389
411141,4,6301973305,"I had seen ""Mr. Skeffington"" quite a few times as a child--it was on Sunday afternoons every once in a while--but it was only when I saw it again as an adult in a revival house only a couple of years ago that I knew it to be an ironic look into Bette's fate, at least appearance-wise.
Bette plays the vain famous beauty Fanny Skeffington, who never develops her interior life because she is fixated on her own good looks. Her NY mansion is crowded with portraits of her beauty and of course, mirrors--lots and lots of mirrors. As the years go by, she has a sort of Dorian Gray (or Dick Clark?) experience of looking youthful even when she actually no longer is young. But then, she contracts diptheria, and loses her looks overnight. From being a beauty, she is transformed into an old lady, older looking than she really is, even.
Now here is where I find the Eerie Foreshadowing. There is a scene of Fanny in her bedroom after the illness, sans any of the makeup and wigs she has had to order and slather on herself. Son of a gun, if she didn't look just like Bette Davis did eventually look towards the end of her life! But that's where the comparison between role and real life end. Whereas Fanny is crushed by the loss of her beauty and can barely look her old husband and suitors in the face, Bette Davis proved to be made of stronger stuff. Facially disfiguring stoke and ravaging breast cancer notwithstanding, Bette didn't hide from the camera and the world; she came right out on Academy Award night for all the world to see. A truly gutsy lady. Interestingly enough, it was Marlene Dietrich who was more like Fanny, granting Maxmillian Schell's request to interview her for a documentary on the condition that she not be filmed to reveal what she looked like as an old woman.
Something that always puzzled me years ago was why the movie was called ""Mr."" Skeffington, when it's really about ""Mrs.""--in fact, for a long period of the movie, Claude Rains' character is even absent from the script. I suppose it's because his influence is there, even if not overtly so. While Fanny is beautiful at the outset, she doesn't have a thin dime until she marries the wealthy Mr. Skeffington, and it's his money that bankrolls her comings and goings for years to come. Claude, like always, delivers my favorite role in the picture--I simply can't get enough of him!
Fanny's great love affair is with herself and her mirror, and it is only after some painful experiences and a final shocking turn of events that she is rattled into kindness and charity. While some reviewers mistakenly believe her to have ""learned her lesson"", I think she just finds the best solution to her current predicament.  Visit with Bette and Claude for a while, and see whether you agree with me or not.",1008806400,21,2779,4.558
411142,5,6301973305,"A pre World War I society beauty, self absorbed and shallow Fanny Trellis (Bette Davis), enjoys being besieged by besotted suitors. She simply cannot make up her mind whom to marry. She finally ends up choosing one of the unlikeliest of men, one who was not even aa avowed suitor, the enormously wealthy Job Skeffington (Claude Rains). Her reasons for marrying the enormously wealthy and jewish Mr. Skeffington are linked to something disgraceful her ne'er do well brother did.
Mr. Skeffington provides Fanny with a good life and simply adores her, tolerating her flirtations with other men as simply something Fanny's vanity requires. They have a child, a daughter, also named Fanny, whom Mr. Skeffington adores. Fanny, however, loves only herself. When Fanny's brother, who had objected to her marriage and had run off to fight in World War I, is killed in action, Fanny  blames her marriage to Mr. Skeffington as the catalyst for his death. From that point on, the marriage takes a nosedive.
Fanny proceeds to take her flirtations beyond the bounds of propriety, and Mr. Skeffington also looks for greener pastures elsewhere, as his is a loveless home. They end up having an open marriage that ultimately ends up in divorce. Mr. Skeffington takes custody of their daughter, when Fanny voluntarily seeks to relinquish custody, as she does not want the responsibility. Fanny proceeds to spend her life charming new suitors and having love affairs. She tries to turn back the hands of time, lavishing much time and effort in remaining youthful in her appearance. Meanwhile, Mr. Skeffington and their daughter spend years living abroad in Europe, until he sends their now grown daughter to live with Fanny just before the outbreak of World War II due to the growing Nazi menace, while he stays behind in Berlin. Unfortunately, he does not fare so well as a jew in Nazi Germany. This 1944 film was one of the first to allude to anti-semitism and the Nazi menace.
When her daughter returns home, after many years of not seeing her mother, as Fanny was always too busy, Fanny is startled by the fact that her daughter is now a young woman, and realizes that she serves just to make Fanny seem older than she appears.  The daughter is an unwelcome reminder that her youth has passed her by. When Fanny is struck down with diptheria and her good looks are ravaged by her illness, she has a hard time coping with the loss of her youthful appearance and comes to a crossroads in her life. What she discovers is hard for her to bear, but she ends up being able to love someone other than herself. Watch the movie to find out who.
This is a superb film with superlative performances by the entire cast. Bette Davis is divine as the silly, self absorbed Fanny. Bette Davis succeeds in making the viewer believe her to be a grand beauty. Speaking in a voice, dripping with artiface, that she purposely pitches high in order to sound more youthful, her voice changes as she ages. Her costumes are first rate, as is her performance of this silly, vapid character. Claude Rains is wonderful, giving a powerful, though understated, performance as the patient and loving Mr. Skeffington. The supporting cast is likewise excellent. The lavish sets are magnificent and give the viewer the feeling of tremendous wealth and power. They are richly redolent of another era. Magnificently cast, the film deservedly won Bette Davis an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.
This is a must see film for all Bette Davis fans. It is also one that those who love vintage films will enjoy!",1007337600,74,3563,4.801302931596092
411143,4,6301973305,"A lengthy, classy, highly enjoyable soap opera of the first calibre. Bette Davis was indeed a phenomenal performer! Arguably the finest actress of Hollywood's heyday, her performances hold up as being some of the most strikingly intense, versatile and heartfelt; they may contain dated notions, to be sure - but one can get fixated just watching this great artist at work. As Fanny Trellis nee Skeffington this time - Davis is amazing in her playing of the selfish, vain woman (she is cast as a famous beauty!) who only sees what is important in life at the end of the picture. While Davis is undeniable brilliant as Fanny, perfect in every mannerism, and although she received an AA nomination for her playing, the personality of the heroine finally defeats the actress' best efforts.  When in the 1930's Fanny, with cosmetic artiface, still carrying on as usual, we simply tire of this silly, foolish woman.  Only Davis could have held the audience this long!  Notice how Bette speaks in a high-pitched voice as young Fanny and gradually lowers her voice a few octaves as the movie progresses. Davis credited her hairdresser, Margaret Donovan for giving her the ""illusion"" of beauty largely through her hairstyle which took an hour each morning to arrange.  The Davis team of  Perc Westmore (make-up) Orry-Kelly (costumes) and her favourite photographer, Ernest Haller worked together to actually make Fanny a great beauty.  Davis was openly aware that she was far from being beautiful - a trait she was much - admired for - but somehow the make-up artists did quite a job making Davis up. After the ravages of diptheria have destroyed Fanny's looks - the aging make-up is incredible - the blind Rains (as Job Skeffington) doesn't know the difference. ""Job says a woman is beautiful only when she is loved"". Orry-Kelly designed the period costumes for Davis and he re-created the fashions from the period of 1914-1940 with astonishing authenticity.",1002672000,3,1950,4.984615384615385
411144,2,6301973305,"watching this movie i expected a five star rating (at least!) for such a distingushed cast, but instead its a jumble of bad story lines mixed into one.
davis is the flighty socialite who marries raines, a dull and workaholic man, who happens to fall in love with her. and so he puts up with her flightiness and watches all her prospective @beaus@ go one at a time. they have a daughter and eventually divorce. but fate puts its hand in...
the above story sounds good, but its hard to say whether its a satire of womens vanity, a romantic drama, a romantic comedy, or what? davis is not in her best form, she speaks at the height of her voice and doesnt add the charisma of such a talent as hers. raines keeps his head above water at least.
its touching at places (in particular the final scene) but the script drowns out the early scenes bringing davis with it.
in my opinion, if you want to enjoy davis, watch jezebel, all about eve or now voyager, this is not, nor even within grasp, of her finest.",999820800,3,1000,4.324468085106383

7819580,3,6301973305,"This should have been a full satire instead of trying to be serious in places. Davis marries for money but is too selfish to ever be a good wife.  She is supposed to be a young debutante at the start, but she is way too old and her delivery as a fatuous young thing makes you want to slap her. And her brother is worse. Claude Rains makes this mess watchable.",1514160000,,359,4.056338028169014
