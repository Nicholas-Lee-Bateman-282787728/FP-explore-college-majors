8426507,5,B004E5IIAG,"I MAINLY BOUGHT THIS SET BECAUSE OF THE 2 GENTLEMAN I MENTIONED. I SAW HATTON IN A MOVIE AND HE WAS BILLED AS THE CREEPER. I NEVER FORGOT HIM AND NOW I HAVE SEVERAL OF HIS FILMS THANKS TO YOU. HE WAS; I THOUGHT THE MOST SCARY PERSON: WHEN I WAS A KID: THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO COME ACROSS AT NIGHT TIME. THAN I WANT TO SAY THAT I PUT MR ATWILL TO THE TOP OF THE LIST WITH MR'S KARLOFF, LUGOSI AND CHANEY JR AS THE BEST AT WHAT THEY DO BEST: FRIGHTENING PEOPLE WITH THEIR FILMS. NONE IS BETTER THAN THE ABOVE MENTIONED STARS. THERE WERE 5 MOVIES ON INDIVIDUAL DISC'S AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THEM. YOU ASK ME TO WRITE A REVIEW ON 'HOUSE OF HORRORS' WHICH I DID. IT IS ONE OF THE FILMS IN THIS SET. A SUPERB STORY WITH SOME VERY FINE ACTORS. ROBRT LOWERY; IF I REMEMBER RIGHT PLAYED BATMAN IN THE SERIALS WHEN I WAS A KID. VIRGINIA GREY; WHO HAD THE MILLION DOLLAR ANKLES IN JOHN WAYNES FILM 'FLAME OF THE BARBARY COAST' WHICH NEVER AIRED TOO OFTEN ON TV. BILL GOODWIN; AN OLD FAMILIAR TV STAR IN A LOT OF SHOWS. ALAN NAPIER; ALONG TIME ACTOR WHO WAS THE BUTLER FOR THE TV BATMAN IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN AND ALSO PLAYED IN THE ZORRO MOVIES. I LEFT MARTIN KOSLEK FOR LAST. HE WAS A GREAT AND FAMILIAR ACTOR WHO VERY RARELY KILLED ANYONE HIMSELF IN A FILM. EVEN WHEN HE PLAYED A GERMAN GESTAPO AGENT; HE ALWAYS HAD OTHERS DO HIS DIRTY WORK. WE GOT ALL THIS IN ONE MOVIE: I AM BLESSED...

MURDERS IN THE ZOO: LIONELL ATWILL AGAIN UP TO HIS TRICKS. IT HAD A FUNNY BUT SMART CHARLIE RUGGLES DOING THE FUNNY STUFF AND HE WAS HILARIOUS. 2 WOMEN AND THE GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTES I DON'T RECALL TOO MUCH ABOUT THEM. THERE'S ONE PERSON LEFT AND THAT WAS RANDOLPH SCOTT. HE WAS AND IS MY FAVORITE COWBOY STAR AFTER JOHN WAYNE. I REMEMBERED HIM IN ""SHE"" AND I HOPE TO PURCHASE IT IF I CAN VERY SOON. I HAVE A LOAD OF HIS MOVIES THAT I'VE TAPED FROM TV: AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR TELEVISION FOR PUTTING ALL THE MOVIES I GOT OF HIM ON THE AIRWAVES. HE WAS A GREAT ASSET TO HOLLYWOOD...

THE MAD DOCTOR OF MARKET STREET WAS NOT EVEN A 3 STAR FILM; BUT OK. IF IT WASN'T FOR UNA MERKEL & LIONELL ATWILL; WHO WASN'T AT HIS BEST; I WOULD HAVE NOT WATCHED IT AT ALL. MRS MERKEL WAS FUNNY..

WHEN I SAW ""THE MAD GHOUL"" IN THE MOVIES; I WAS WITH A GIRL WHO WAS IN HISTERICS AND PAWING AT ME BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T LOOK AT DAVID BRUCE WHEN HE CHANGED INTO THE GHOUL. I NEVER SAW THAT FILM AGAIN UNTIL THE OTHER NIGHT; WHEN I COULD SEE IT WITHOUT INTERUPTION. NO, I DIDN'T MARRY THE GIRL. THE BEAUTIFUL EVELYN ANKERS IS AND ALWAYS WAS A KIDS DREAM TO SPEND AN EVENING WITH. TURHAN BEY IS ONLY A THOUGHT IN MY PAST; THAT I REMEMBER HE WAS IN ONE OF THE MUMMY MOVIES. THAN MILBURN 'DOC' STONE OF GUNSMOKE FAME AND LOADS OF FILMS TO HIS CREDIT...

LAST AND NOT LEAST ""THE STRANGE CASE OF DR RX."" I REMEMBER: PATRIC KNOWLES FROM THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD AND NOT MANY OTHER FILMS: SAMUEL S HINDS HINDS FROM MANY PICS; PLUS GOOD OLD SHEMP HOWARD FROM THE 3 STOOGES FAME: BUT ONE FACE WAS FAMILIAR FROM THE CHARLIE CHAN ERA; AND THAT IS ""MANTAN MORLAND."" THERE IS ALWAYS MANY A LAUGH AND ENJOYMENT WITH HIS ANTICS.

THAT ROUNDS OUT MY REVIEW OF THIS SET OF MOVIES... TO ME IT WAS GREAT FUN AND IT REALLY IS 5 STARS...",1398643200,,3174,4.063897763578275
8426508,4,B004E5IIAG,"Fun set of classis Universal horror films, ones that are not easily available.  This set includes the GREAT Murders in the Zoo, a shocker then, and one that is still a bit shocking today.  The opening scene is great, and Atwill is at his best in this film.

 BUT!!!! This price is a rip off. Turner Classic Movies is offering this set for only $49.00 (a price I feel is also too much, but much less than this outrageous price.)  Someone is trying to rip you off. Be Warned!",1291075200,3,473,4.269662921348314
