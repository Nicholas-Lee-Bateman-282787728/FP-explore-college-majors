2290620,5,B0009H97GW,"I completely disagree with a previous negative review of this made for television movie.

It's true that there are a number of portions of this movie that simply didn't occur; Coy & Hubbard sleeping in kitchen, reliance of Shockley for divergence, Cretzer's death, etc. Despite the preceding, Alcatraz fans should be so grateful for the existence of this movie (along with the other made for TV movie Alcatraz: the Whole Shocking Story and the classic Escape from Alcatraz) as all three of these movies belong together in the same collection.

This movie tells an amazing story of how one man, the only convict in Alcatraz history, conceived of a plan to capture guns in the cellblock. Would I have filmed this movie differently? Yes! A film which very closely stuck to the script as outlined by Earnest Lageson's definitive history of this event (Battle at Alcatraz) would have been perfect. So whilst this movie fails to do this, we should still be very excited about its existence. For this reason it's a must see for us Alcatraz fans.",1368921600,,1038,4.825842696629214
2290621,2,B0009H97GW,"What a piece of crap movie! Low budget, cheesy acting, looks like a film student filmed and wrote it. Prison inmates try to break out of prison and just all get killed at the end. Sucked.",1267747200,,187,4.222222222222222
2290622,5,B0009H97GW,"This movie was an unexpected delight to see. I am not making light of the subject matter, either. This movie is grave in tone but shockingly not nearly as dark as I was expecting.

I freely admit I know nothing about the history of the Rock. I was simply looking for an interesting David Carradine movie to watch...This certainly fit that bill! I admire how this bunch of actors, headed by Carradine, dared and succeeded in showing something rarely seen--let alone with believability--that convicts are still Human Beings.

Longing for home, mercy, dedication, patience, friendship, suffering, and desperation are all showcased here. Without negating the gravity of these men's crimes, they cause you to see them as the 'likable underdogs' (half the outfit for me).

Worth seeing.",1246060800,,780,5.125984251968504
2290623,2,B0009H97GW,"As a long time follower of Alcatraz and its history, to say that I found this film dissapointing is an understatement. Is heavily influenced by the same titled (and vastly superior) book by Clark Howard.
The story itself centers around six individuals, but mainly Kentucky bank robber Bernard ""Bernie"" Coy - David Carradine trying his best to drag above a painfully wooden script loaded with the worst of B action movie cliche lines. Coy spent years working on the weaknesses of Alcatraz, arguably the most infamous prison in history - only to find out that the only area not heavily enforced was the main guards' cage, complete with cellblock keys and armaments! He creates an elaborate escape attempt relying on the help of Marvin Hubbard (David Morse in the film's best performance), Joe Cretzer (Howard Hesseman in by far and away the worst), ""Buddy"" Thompson (Jan-Michael Vincent), Sam Shockley (Charles Haid), and the only survivor of the whole thing - ""Dan Durando"" (really Clarence Carnes, his name was kept quiet originally, being a witness and all) and in May of 1946 they went to work.
The crux of the film arrives when the plot goes horribly awry due to a misplaced key and jammed lock. As things get more desperate the cons turn on each other, with the exception of Coy and Hubbard, who were friends to start with. Cellhouse guards are injured and killed, prompting the arrival of the Marines, among others. It is during this point that the film's biggest flaws really show - aforementioned script, a score that consists of chains clanking and a mechanical ""ugh"" for emphasis, numerous historical and continuity problems too lengthy to mention (not that I'm a purist, they were just that bad), and the persistent bugger that apparently in all of Alcatraz the only prisoners are our lot and Robert Stroud, the ""Birdman"" (Dennis Farina, in a role much more dramatic and key in reality) as cons run down empty cellblocks that previously had random hands sticking out to and fro all over. Without giving away the ultimate ending, things don't fare too well.  And neither does the film, shot on location with some incredible views in that aspect. It comes across as a really low grade B movie, such a sad thing considering what happened and how the film could have been made with better attention to detail - and casting somebody, anybody other than Howard Hesseman. Persons not familiar with the ""crashout"" as it was called might find it interesting as a springboard in to better things. Folks interested in a better popcorn film (as this is intended to be on some levels) can check out David Morse yet again in ""The Rock"" or that Clint Eastwood perrenial ""Escape from Alcatraz."" Just don't bother with this.",1197158400,2,2717,4.830472103004292
2290624,4,B0009H97GW,"Lived up to expectations, having read a couple of accounts of the eacape attempt by different authors.  Not a fast paced action type movie, along similar pace as Escape from Alcatraz.",1183420800,,183,4.903225806451613
2290625,5,B0009H97GW,"I remember seeing this movie on Channel 4 (NBC) back in 1987, and I'm happy to see that it finally made it to DVD.  The first time I saw this movie, I found it very interesting.  However, having visited Alcatraz twice in the last 3 years, I have a deeper appreciation of this movie.  During the audio tour of Alcatraz, this attempted escape is mentioned, and it adds to the prison's notorious and fascinating history.

The movie basically retells the Battle of Alcatraz, which took place in May 1946 when six prisoners attempted to escape.  However, unplanned events prevented the leader Bernie Coy (David Carradine) from executing his escape plan, which he had prepared over the previous seven years.  The drama that unfolds is tense as his accomplices begin to fight among themselves and think of alternative ways to get off the island once their plan is foiled.  In the end, their escape attempt is anything but successful.  David Carradine is great, but I also enjoyed the supporting performances of David Morse (Marvin Hubbard) and Howard Hesseman (Joe 'Dutch' Cretzer).

Overall, this is a very good movie, and it just adds another layer of history that anyone interested in Alcatraz may want to research.  I also like that the movie is fast-paced and doesn't waste a lot of time with unnecessary character development.  If anyone has ever been to Alcrataz, they will recognize everything in the movie, and this contributes to the feeling of actually being at Alcatraz.",1165449600,2,1475,4.907258064516129
2290626,5,B0009H97GW,"the battle of alcatraz was an escape attempt with far more drama and better planning than morris and the anglins or cole and roe's escape,but those guys were never found so people can say ""they might have made it"" even though they probably did not.the six against the rock guys did not,well clarence carnes(under the name dan durando in the movie)did not die the rest did.bernard coy(davis caradine)joe cretzer(howard hesseman)and marvin hubbard(david morse)were killed after a long battle with gaurds and the marines.miran thompson(jan-michael vincent)and sam shockley(charles haid)were exucuted in san quentins gas chamber.coy hatched the plan to take the gun gallery,from loseing weight to smearing alex grease all over him he used a prison made bar spreader to painfully squeze through the bars and suprise the gaurd disarming him and capturing the guns and night sticks the plan is to go out the yard door and down to the prison boat....but....something goes wrong.i don't want to give you the ending but if you buy this movie you already know enough about alcatraz to know what happens. for being a tv movie this is amazing!!! i won't dare say its better than escape from alcatraz..but it is good. now we have to get alcatraz the whole shocking story out on dvd. thanks dean",1150675200,,1280,5.014084507042254
