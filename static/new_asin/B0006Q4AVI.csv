2190813,4,B0006Q4AVI,"I always scoffed at the idea that a cat would be interested in watching a video, and I never would have gotten this one if it hadn't come with Austin, a recent feline addition to our family.  But he watches it!  He loves it!  He'll set there watching intently, and occasionally he gets up on his hind legs and bats the TV screen. It's SO funny.  The other three cats have viewed it, too -- none will sit through it as thoroughly enrapt as Austin does, but I've had as many as three of them lined up in front of the TV at once, watching the show.  Their favorites seem to be the gerbils and finches, but the fish and squirrels are popular, too.

What can I say?  If I saw a Go Cat Video Adventure Vol. 2, I'd probably pick up a copy for Austin!",1111708800,,743,4.0479452054794525
2190814,3,B0006Q4AVI,"This tape has five different scenarios (birds, fish, chipmunks, squirrels and butterflies), each including lots of sound and motion to get your cat's attention. I believe each sequence is repeated once, not that your cat will notice! We have shown this to a bunch of different cats, the indoor cats generally latch on to at least one of the sequences (like butterflies). No one seems to be interested in all of them. Cats that have spent time outdoors may ignore most of it, or perk up when something familiar to their own yard pops up.

There's no guarantee your cat will enjoy this, but it's a nice try.",1104278400,,605,4.601851851851852

2190818,4,B0006Q4AVI,"My cat loves this video. I've got an 8 yr old solely indoor cat who enjoys watching birds, squirrels, mice and anything else that happens to cross her path when she's sitting on the window ledge. She's got lots of toys and scratchers but still gets board at times. I bought the video and she immediately runs to watch it. She loves the sounds of birds and her favorites are: squirrels, mice, gerbils, and finches. She's not too interested in the fish or the big birds. Overall, this keeps her entertained. The only suggestion would be to change out some of the sounds. The same bird chirp is heard throughout the video. I would recommend this product",1471392000,,650,4.564102564102564
2190819,5,B0006Q4AVI,"Perfect gift for Dad, new car owner, ""neat freaks,"" or anyone who wants to keep their car clean!  It fits easily in the glove box, between the seat and console, or in a cleaning kit bag/bin. Since most cars nowadays are black or gray interior it goes great with the decor.  You can use it dry for the dashboard, windshield, and seats; leather or cloth. You can spray a light mist of (my favorite is Meguire's) cleaner/polish on the microfiber top and get even more dust and debris from the dash for a bit of shine. You could even get a bucket of warm water and your favorite (or mine;Meguire's) cleaner and go to town on those cup holders and all of the other plastics that have old coffee and soda spilled on them. I bought two: one for wet and one for dry. When you're done with the wet just rinse it out thoroughly and let it air-dry. Never put microfiber in a dryer unless you have a cold air setting and this guy has a handle you don't want thumping around in there anyway.  Speaking of the handle, it's easy to grip, even with my arthritis.",1470182400,,1046,4.2727272727272725

2190827,5,B0006Q4AVI,My cat LOVES this video.  I've had the video for 3 days and when it isn't on she will ask me to play it.  We recently moved from an apt with huge windows that looked out into trees in the suburbs to an apt in the city with views only of building walls.  My cat needed to see animals again and be engaged.  This cheesy video has made such a difference for her. The rats and the squirrel are her favorites.  She really likes the finches too. She sits in front of the tv and talks to it for 45 mins every day when I get home.  Then sometimes once more when she asks me to play it again.

She got close to the TV screen to touch images gently with her paws, and kept standing straight up or sitting up like a meerkat making strange kitty noises at the screen and totally LOVING it all!!!!  I am so HAPPY I found this absolutely wonderful, entertaining DVD for my beloved critter. Now I can run my errands and go to the gym without feeling she is lonely. It plays and loops as long as you like. Works for me and DEFINITELY works for my kitty girl. HIGHLY recommend!!!",1439251200,,556,4.55

However, he then began trying to get around the TV and noticing that they weren't responding to him.  After about 5 minutes, he was done with the video and moved on to physical toys.
This would really depend on the cat/kitten.  For some, it may hold their interest longer.
By the way, he did the same thing with a couple of iPad cat games.  Interested for a little bit, but once he figured out he couldn't get through to the fish/mice, he lost interest.",1439164800,,592,4.453703703703703

Some of the video is fairly high quality and other parts seem pretty amateurish and low quality, but our kitty really seems to like it... a little too much, actually.  She watched it in fascination the first time, not quite sure what to make of it.  The second time she got pretty excited, pacing around and looking around the back of the TV to see how she could get in to get the little creatures and fish.  The third time she decided she definitely wanted to catch some fish.  After several attacks on our large flatscreen TV, I decided to put away the DVD until after her front paws were declawed.  That's been done now (along with her spaying) and although she seems totally healed up, I'm giving it a couple more weeks just to make sure, as this DVD seems to get her pretty excited.

We mind the chirping but to her, that's her call, letting her know that her ""show"" is on the TV.  We love watching her watch the DVD... so it's entertaining for the humans too!

Our second cat doesn't care for it much.  She can't be bothered to sit and watch for any measurable period of time.  But she has the feline equivalent of ADHD so we were hopeful, but not disappointed when she wouldn't watch the DVD.",1427587200,,675,4.25984251968504

It was simply 3 different cats, at different times, watching a TV that shows birds at a bird feeder, some gerbils running over a piece of wood.  Chirping noises.  First it was one cat.  Then another cat watching the same thing.  Then a third cat watching the same thing on a TV.  Then it repeated, going back to the first cat.  It did NOT attract my cat's attention at all.  She looked at my TV, the expression on her face was ""that's just on TV; that's not real.""  She ignored it completely, so I have spent $17.59 for nothing.  She always got very excited when we lived where she could get on a window sill and see real birds and squirrels out the window.  But she knows the difference between real and what's on TV, i.e., not real.  Is there anyway I can return the video since she has no interest in it whatsoever?",1426291200,,870,4.174698795180723

Now she's like a lively kitten ready to pounce on anything. Thank you thank you thank you for Gary the gerbil, which is her favorite, and Paulie the Parrot for intervening at just the right time. I don't know how I could have gone on watching her slowly deteriorate into such a sad state.

When I got the 4th cat, a kitten, I had to move the ottoman over in front of the TV so he could see it comfortably (he kept falling off the coffee table trying to bat the critters on the screen).  Each cat, no matter their age or aged bones, ears and eyes, had fun watching the DVD.  The older cats expressed an interest in something new to them and they weren't required to exert themselves if they didn't feel up to it.  I did not leave this on all day every day, but put it on for the cats every 10 days or so.

Besides the parrot sections, the volume of the background noise varies and can sometimes be a little startling to them. My cats are indoor-only and have only ever been around quiet adults so they are not used to sudden noises.

2191015,4,B0006Q4AVI,"I actually purchased this DVD from another retailer, but I wanted to leave a review for my fellow Amazon-ers anyway.

I confess, I bought this out of guilt. When we lived in Los Angeles my 2 cats had their own little room (yes, I'm that kind of crazy kitty mama) with two walls of windows that overlooked trees and a yard. They spent hours sitting on the window sills watching the birds, squirrels and other critters, and I felt terrible about taking that away from them when we moved to Brooklyn. We're now on the 26th floor of a high-rise in the concrete jungle and there's no wildlife for them to watch, just the occasional airplane in the distance and the twinkling lights of the city at night.

Both cats are instinctive hunters/stalkers, and occasionally when I'm watching something on Animal Planet they'll run over to the TV to get a closer look at the animals on the screen, but they tend to wander away after a minute or two. I wasn't sure if this DVD would be any different but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm glad I did! One of them was instantly mesmerized by it - she jumped up onto the entertainment center and stared at it through pretty much the entire first run, meowing on and off throughout and swiping at a few of the animals. My other cat feigned disinterest at first but eventually joined her sister up there and got into it. I even caught her trying to climb onto the top of the TV to see where they were coming from :)

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there are a couple of scenes that don't quite hold their attention as much (I wish the swimming fish lasted longer), and the soundtrack could use some variety instead of the constant chirping birds for an hour. All in all though I'm happy with the purchase, as are the cats. The one who really loves it now jumps up onto the TV stand when she wants to watch it, and sits there looking back and forth between me and the TV until I turn it on for her!

I'm not crazy about them swiping at my brand-new TV screen (note to self, trim their nails again!), and I'll have to supervise for a while to be sure they don't keep trying to climb on top of the TV since it's wall-mounted, but I'm really happy they're enjoying it.",1408838400,,2206,4.257756563245823

One thing that frustrated me about the video was the amount of time they seemed to spend advertizing Da Bird toy and the videos.

There is a chance that kittens are simply too active to sit still, but my kitties are often entranced by the cursor on my computer screen, and spend more time watching it than they did the hijinks on the DVD.

2191053,5,B0006Q4AVI,"I am going on vacation for a week so I wanted to get something to entertain my poor cat while I'm gone.  I got this due to all the great reviews and decided to play it on loop for 2 days to see if he would lose interest in it.  As soon as I started it up and he saw it, he was instantly mesmerized and tried to figure out how to get to the mice...under the tv, around it, etc.  I was worried he might get frustrated or decide to ignore it.  After about 30 minutes he did walk away (probably when the parrots came on since he doesn't seem to like them.)

However, when he was in the mood, he periodically would come back to the tv and watch it closely or paw at the screen.  He doesn't try to get around to the inside anymore, but even 2 days later he still sometimes watches it from a comfy spot or occasionally comes right up and paws (usually at the mice).  It's perfect for him as the window I have has nothing interesting to see so this is great entertainment for him when he is in the mood to watch stuff.

Incidentally, I first tried him out on some youtube videos on my large screen tv and he loved the birds and squirrels that were ""appropriately sized"" but was not as interested in the closeups of the birds that were almost as big as him, so when I got the video, I played in on my smaller 19"" tv (which I also don't mind him scratching though he hasn't damaged it at all) so the animals are realistically sized.  For people who are not having success with this, maybe try it on a smaller, less intimidating tv.  If you want to ""try it out"" on your cat first, do a search for ""videos for cats"" and choose the youtube one by billgobson...he has two great ones, one with birds and one with squirrels, both great for a large screen tv (40""-46"") though a bit small for my 27"" tv (if they're too small to be realistic, my picky cat just ignores them).",1366416000,,1856,4.074175824175824

She was absorbed in it, mouth twitching, tail swishing, body arched - and she is 17 years old!  She looked behind it and all around it to figure out where the creatures were.  The other kitty showed her usual aversion to TV until I picked her up, put her in my lap, and tilted her chin up to see the show.

I'd been eyeing this dvd for a while after seeing it highlighted on moderncat.com and when it went on sale I grabbed two, one for me  and one for a family member, it even arrived extra fast and arrived in time for Christmas. I'm very pleased I got it.

I LOVE that is has a ""loop"" feature so I can turn it on while I'm gone to work or out shopping. My cat now comes running when I turn on the dvd player (seriously) She is glued to the tv for all of the segments with the small birds and mice, , even climbing on the tv to try and get to the birds.

She could care less about the segments with the fish, parrots and squirrels.

pros: The loop feature. great segments of tiny birds keep my cat interested

cons: The fish segments are unnecessary, especially with the bird chirping soundtrack. The music video of cats playing is also pointless and unnecessary.

Overall I highly recommend this dvd if your cat is prey driven.",1357257600,,964,4.183783783783784

I work 40 hours a week, and between working, running errands, and socializing, my cat is home alone more than either of us would like.  Though she had never shown any interest in TV, after reading reviews on this product I figured it was worth a shot.  I'm so happy I bought it--she LOVES it.

The first time I put it on, she climbed up into her kitty condo and was literally on the edge of her seat, mesmerized by the sounds and images on the screen.  She chatters at the TV, walks behind it to try to figure out how to get at the birds and fish, and stands on her hind legs and bats at the screen.  It's hilarious to watch!!!

It has not been quite one week since I bought the DVD, but I have noticed some changes in my kitty.  For one, she is more playful than she's been in years.  She's chasing balls and doing laps around the apartment.  Secondly, she seems much happier and more loving.  She's always been a cuddler, but she is purring louder than ever before.  When I used to leave for work in the morning, she would charge the door and want to come with me and I would feel so guilty having to leave her home alone.  Now, I just put her movie on, and she's instantly entertained.  I play it on a loop throughout the day, and when I get home in the evening I turn it off, feed her dinner, throw her toys around, and let her know how much I love her.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with cats, especially anyone who has to leave their cat(s) alone for more than a couple hours at a time.  It's not a big monetary investment, so if your cat isn't into it, it's no big loss--just give it to a friend with cats and perhaps they will enjoy it.",1353974400,,1756,4.058139534883721

I was skeptical, but it worked!

I periodically work from home and have conference calls or webinars where background silence is necessary.  My adorable little feline friend -- a very talkative Siberian Russian mix -- loves to chirp at me when I'm talking.  I bought this DVD with the intention of getting her to focus on the movie and not on me while I work.

Well..it was definitely an effective kitty-sitter.  She sat and stared at the loop of images and sounds for a few hours, periodically getting up to try and bat at the images on the TV.  She was also just super relaxed with the noises that played, kneading away on a comfy blanket I'd put in her favorite chair in front of the TV (she's spoiled).

In short, she was enthralled and I'm both surprised and pleased.  Highly recommended.  Why don't they sell these in pet stores?!?",1350950400,6,923,4.539393939393939

In fact, he's tried to climb up 'into' the computer (lol) to get to them, and accidentally set it to something else! Now he doesn't do that, but he's definitely into it for a while.

I was disappointed, too, because it plays in an endless loop. I had hoped it would be something I could enjoy with my cats, but it's just annoying to me. I've never bought one of these DVDs for cats, so maybe they're all made similarly. But I feel like I wasted my money.

2191098,5,B0006Q4AVI,"This is a difficult DVD to review because each cat has different animal interests, each cat has a different degree of interest and (this is a big one folks) each cat as a lovable level of I.Q. (I.Q. vaires in cats as with humans). All of these factors, as well as the personality of your cat, will depend on how succesful you will find this DVD. We'll use a research study of seven cats. Four of these cats are feral but have been tamed in a contained environment and are all now comfortable with their owner, if not the other three cats. They seeme to have remained a family unit. The other cats were all dumped and taken in and present an average blend of personality, intelligence and interests of the domestic cat.

The DVD begins with a advertisment set to Struass' ""Blue Danube Waltz"" where various cats playing with a ""Boing"" toy. This is a delight to one of the domesticated males, a long hair bully sort who's ability to purr more loudly than the Strauss is impressive. He stands before the computer screen (we did not put it on the TV as one cat will leap up onto the armoire and block the vision for the other cats) because a great deal of watching this is about sniffing at the confusing screen- ""Are these birds real?"" Joey (the large fluffy bruiser of whoim we already spoke) tends to step on the keys and becomes frustrated when it pauses or beeps or, on one delightfully amusing occasions, ejected the disc altogether. As people, watching the cats is far more interesting than the birds. The rodentws are the biggest hitsa; the fish are the least interesting and the squirrel ties with the fish as least interesting. So two of the cats are enthralled all of the time, three a good deal of the time, one sometimes and then one not at all. Some cats don;t care and others are simply enthralled. This, by the way, is not the only disc available. This is, however, the only one I've seen fifteen hundred times which leaves me, in my humble opinion, an expert.

The DVD loops so that presumably you could leave for work in the morning and it would continue all day. Our most intelligent cat, a tiny thing once feral who gave birth to three bruisers, is fascinated and regards the plethora of birds and hamsters from a distance, though she HAS been known to stand stage right of the computer as Joey, the bonzer bloke, stands stage left. We've never had more than four of the seven cats intersted at the same thing at the same time. One cat has never shown the least bit of interest in anything other than food and affection, food coming first, so there are no guaranttees that your DVD will please your cat. This is a sure thing if you have several cats and it'sa crap shoot if you've only one. I would have to say that both human and feline specoies have learned to love this in our home though I've had enough of Ricard Strauss and his Vienese Waltzes.

Then  held him and pointed out the rodents in the first clip.  HE LOVED IT!  He now rubs the TV stand when he wants to watch the video, I've slept through the night, and he plays more and requires less attention.  My other cat that is 12 is way to smart for this, and she could care less.  But I'm not home during the day and the 7 year old needs a lot of attention, and I need something to keep him entertained.

I was a little afraid to leave her alone with the video that she might get too excited and tip over the tv.

He seemed pretty entertained.

The biggest problem I have with this video is the annoying looped chirping sounds that persist throughout the ENTIRE MOVIE (during footage of squirrels, of rats, of...fish??). I'm not a cat, but I'm pretty sure that no one wants to hear the same bird chirp repeated 10,000 times. Also, the video didn't have hours and hours of footage like I assumed it would; it ran maybe 90 mins tops.

2191121,5,B0006Q4AVI,"This is a great, quality DVD. It has a range of animals in it: pet rodents, parrots, wild birds, squirrels, butterflies and fish to name a few. There's a constant nature background noise of chirping mostly and it can be pretty annoying for us humans, but cats will like the DVD even if it's on mute. The video automatically loops and will play over and over.

I have two cats, one of whom had previously shown an interest in the tv and computer screen and that's the only one that likes the DVD. My other cat doesn't care about it. So it will depend on your cat's personality as to whether he/she will respond to this DVD. I recommend putting your cat in a chair really close to the tv screen to help it take notice and get into this DVD.",1267747200,3,738,4.23404255319149

2191136,4,B0006Q4AVI,"I ordered Cat Sitter vol 1 the day after Christmas and it arrived within a few days. My cats were immediately drawn to the television by the chirping noises. The male saw the rodents, birds, fish and butterflies on the screen and sat with his nose to the screen for a couple of hours -- completely mesmerized. My female just did not seem to see what was on the screen or make the connection between the noises and the images. The second time I played the DVD she came into the room because of the noises. I held her up in front of the TV several times and suddenly her body twitched and stiffened and I knew she saw them. She then sat with her nose to the screen for a couple of hours. After a few showings the DVD no longer holds their attention for hours, but they love it and spend a long time watching and tapping at the screen. They like to relax on an ottoman just in front of the tv. They will wander out of the room for a while and then come back in and watch some more. The noises seem to relax them. The male loves all the rodents, the female prefers the birds. Neither are too interested in the fish which surprises me. I notice both of them watching regular tv now and then which they never did before. All in all it is a good purchase that helps to provide some variety of sights and sounds in the wintertime for a couple of indoor cats.",1264550400,,1350,4.117424242424242
2191137,5,B0006Q4AVI,"Our 6 year old couch potato cat loves this DVD and we love watching her watch it!! She is usually very docile but this DVD is like a morning cup of coffee-it makes her energetic and alert. She sits right in front of the TV and often paws at the screen(she has no claws-adopted that way)and even goes behind the TV looking for the critters. Sometimes she sits on the ottoman staring at the blank TV screen then looks up at as if to say, ""I want to watch TV now please.""
We also tried Cat Sitter Vol. 2 and 3 but much too repetitious, Vol. 1 is the best. My family and I enjoy watching her interact with this DVD. Since she has now discovered TV I often turn the cartoon channel on when I run errands, she likes the cartoons that have a lot of action. Recently my husband was watching a program on the Science Channel about deep space and the universe, much to our surprise our cat was mesmerized, I have no idea why since the images where just odd shapes and colors moving around but nothing remotely like a critter! Maybe it triggered something primordial in her psyche. She also has been seen sitting comfortably in my husbands lap watching war movies, various sporting events and oddly enough Chris Matthews on Hardball!
Great buy and makes a good gift for cat loving friends.",1258502400,14,1278,4.373949579831932
2191138,5,B0006Q4AVI,"We ended up saving a couple of feral kittens from a wandering mother. She was hit by a car and the thought of having to consign the kittens to be euthanized didn't sit well with the wife. My wife is familiar with cats, so she has been doing most of the work. I'm not a cat person, so I've had to learn a lot of cat behavior through reading books, online research, etc. We have tried many things and products that promised things, and we have a box of toys neither cat likes. They both have a few favorites, but we do run into trouble trying to keep them entertained to prevent destructive behavior.

After reading about this product I was hoping it was going to work as advertised. I was also encouraged by the reviews written, so thought I would take a chance. I must say that from the first time the DVD was played, the cats sat down and were enthralled with the motion and action on the screen. Once in a while we have to raise our voice to keep them from getting carried away with the screen, but they will sit for at least 20 to 30 minutes a session before they lose interest. One of our cats has even come in and sat in front of the TV waiting to watch the DVD. If you are looking for a nice relaxing time, this is a great product for your cats.

Oh my God!  He watched (and attacked the TV screen) for seven hours straight before I turned it off.  Then he ate, and slept in front of the TV all night--never moved.  After a week, he is a much happier cat, and never gets tired of watching.  The only thing that would improve this DVD would be to have shots of stalking, chasing, striking behavior; my cat's favorite is Animal Planets ""Killing for a Living"" series.  This DVD is a happy, non-violent production that will not disturb young children.",1250208000,16,709,4.616

I put it on just before I leave...and now she doesn't even notice I'm walking out the door...she used to lay in front of my door to block me from leaving! I put her cat tree in front of the TV and it puts her at the same height of the TV and she just sits there and paws at it...it is so cute! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it had more diversity...but my baby doesn't seem to mind.,1233187200,,562,3.73109243697479

Every once in a while, one of them will stand on their hind legs and stretch up to touch the TV screen with a paw. They don't use their claws when they do this, just the pads of the paw.

It may take more than one try before a cat gets interested.  The first couple times, they ignored it completely.  Now they can't get enough!",1229040000,,423,4.109756097560975
2191142,5,B0006Q4AVI,"Well first of all I'll talk about the cats! One evening while vegging-out, I noticed one of my cats watching TV. He continued to do this on occasion and since he can get restless sometimes I decided to purchase a DVD (not these). The only problem with that video is the sound. The cat really likes but it can get on my nerves. It can be found here and has the word PURR in it. In the meantime cat #2 would pay attention at times but otherwise be fairly unaffected.

Seeing cat #1's delight I decided to try a few more DVD's and ordered the Cat Sitter DVD's, 1,2 and 3. Cat #1 LOVES them (of course we knew he would) but cat #2 seems to have turned into an even bigger fan than the #1!  She won't leave the TV when these are on. When the butterflies come on she nearly goes through the screen! Once in awhile they're not in the mood for TV and require real interaction (which is great) but when they're awake but just chillin', they are mesmerized by these DVD's.

All three DVD's contain a mix of birds, gerbils, hamsters, squirrels, rats, fish, butterflies and various eye-catching (and ear catching) surprises. ""Cat Sitter"" (1) has lots of rodent-type activity but includes all of the above. ""Cat Sitter 2"" has lots of birds (plus the other stuff) and ""Cat Sitter 3"" has lots of fish in aquariums (plus the other stuff).

The background sounds on these could not be done any better but the cats enjoy it without the sound too. The video quality could be a National Geographic feature - absolutely beautiful. I can't say enough about these videos. They are so visually beautiful that they truly may help YOU to relax as well. Personally I believe that these may be just as healthy for US to have on as they are for the cats! Our kids will definitely be getting these in their Christmas stockings for their little furry pets. I wish I could give these videos 10 stars.",1224115200,150,1868,4.390173410404624

Our two youngest cats think this video is the best thing ever (OK, next to hockey on TV)! They were completely captivated from the very beginning.  The sights and sounds immediately got their interest and kept it. The youngest of the two boys even jumped up to sit right against the screen to watch the birds.  It does get a little monotonous for the humans in the house, but this wasn't made to entertain us.  For the cats, it's just great!",1210896000,,576,4.39622641509434

Especially living in a state where winter time means snow, we are so thankful that this is available.  Every time we put it in our cat chatters up a storm and goes right up to the screen watching every little movement.  It is a sure way to get our cat out of her slumber and into something she really enjoys.  Indoor life though safe can be a bit boring.  Now there is something interesting we can offer when our cat when our schedules are busy.  She is so happy watching it and every time we turn on the TV now, she has to check out if it is ""her movie"" or not.  We are thankful for the joy it has brought her.

The next day, I left the DVD on Loop while I was away at work for over 9 hours. When I returned later that evening, within minutes, he aggressively attacked me--scratching my legs and foot and viciously biting my hand and arm. I was shocked at his ferocious behavior, and quite frankly, became frightened of this usually docile, male, neutered indoor house cat that I adopted from a shelter over 2 1/2 years ago.  I had to run from the room and shut the door to escape his attack.  He has NEVER acted like that in the past and I can only attritube this behavior from becoming OVER-stimulated, and perhaps frustrated, from watching and hearing all the critters on this DVD and not being able to interact with them.  I have no other explanation -- so BEWARE!  No where on this DVD, does it meaning a warning of this sort!",1163030400,28,952,4.417142857142857

When introducing the video, it is important to minimalize distractions and it may take a few viewings before your cat becomes used to it.

8042249,4,B0006Q4AVI,"If you have the option between your cats taking up your computer time to watch videos at youtube and letting them watch this DVD on your TV, I'd choose the TV. For a long time I've encouraged my cats to watch birds at youtube and now finally they get their own TV show that lasts for about an hour.

This entertained my adult cat and my kitten. They took turns batting at the screen and generally being amused. Yes this has an annoying bird sound all through the entire production so I turned the volume off. The cats were still entranced even when they could not hear the sounds. It was more the movement on the screen that they were attracted to.

So what is on this DVD. Well there are butterflies, rodents galore, birds at feeders, squirrels, a raccoon, tropical fish and a very funny parrot that steals food from another bird. That made me lol.

To be honest this was not filmed for human enjoyment. There are some shaky camera scenes were the person filming was trying to keep track of the squirrel which was running about. The rest seems to have been filmed with a steady camera.

One of the funny things my cats did while watching was basically trying to catch the butterflies. I put a ottoman in front of the screen so they could see the video properly. My TV is old so I don't mind cat claws scratching at the screen, but I caution anyone who cares that pawing at the screen or trying to climb behind the TV is a possibility. My cats are smart enough to think the animals are in or behind the TV.

So if you have been watching youtube videos this is a really good option. It is not perfect and you might turn the sound off or leave the room and let the cats have their fun. I'd not leave this on continual loop however. About 20 minutes to an hour is enough entertainment.
