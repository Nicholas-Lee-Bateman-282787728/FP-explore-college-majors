8670327,1,B00M4QQ12E,Nasty scratch in disc. I gave it a try anyway. Because the movie freezes you don't know how it ends. Good movie otherwise.,1484006400,,122,4.3478260869565215
8670328,2,B00M4QQ12E,"I remembered this 1976 film fondly. Watching it again has left me less enthusiastic. The first half is often funny with Jack Lemmon offering cutting and cynical comments to both Bujold--who had left him 4 years earlier and who now wants bailed out of jail--and to Woods, whose character Lemmon verbally abuses throughout the film (you don't understand why until the last 10 minutes). However, the middle 30-40 minutes of the film drags and the sequencing is confusing as the film often flips back-and-forth between current time and the days 4 years previous when Bujold and Lemmon's character first meet. All in all, I'd call it a noble failure.

However, I'll reserve my biggest criticism for the technical quality of this DVD. First, the aspect ratio is all screwed up. It was originally shot in 1.85:1 widescreen, but this is shown in 1.33:1. Second, the overall quality of the transfer is extremely poor. It looks as though the source material was a VHS tape--fuzzy with muted colors.

Unless you just loved this film and can't wait, I'd hold off purchasing until a decent anamorphic widescreen version taken from the original source elements becomes available.",1419638400,6,1165,5.0

8670330,3,B00M4QQ12E,"Jack Lemmon was one of the most versatile performers in the film medium proving himself adept at both comic and dramatic roles.  Genevieve Bujold was a reliable actress in her day being both talented and sexy.  With that said ""Alex & the Gypsy"" is somewhat of a disappointment.  Despite the best efforts of the stars and a young James Woods in a supporting role they cannot overcome the film's disjointed script.  Matters aren't helped by jarring flashback sequences and a baffling ending.  Regardless, the film is worth checking out if you are a fan of these actors or as a Seventies curio.",1408233600,2,591,4.754901960784314
