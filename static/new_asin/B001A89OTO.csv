8276434,5,B001A89OTO,The DVDs really keep my babies attention. She watches it every morning and she's captivated. You'll especially love being able to switch up the DVDs for a change and not have to have the same one all the time.,1364688000,2,209,4.384615384615385
8276435,2,B001A89OTO,This was someone I hoped to support since he's from the same hometown but I just can't support the hack. Just wanting to prevent others from wasting their time and money. Don Geronimo is a great comedian if you'd like to find an alternative.,1299456000,,241,4.5
8276436,5,B001A89OTO,"Oops, left out a comma in the title.  I really enjoyed this whole movie.  It was both funny and very touching.  I have seen Keith Lowell Jensen perform stand up comedy so I was expecting a very funny film which it turned out to have a lot of funny spots but then it turned out to be so much more than just a funny look at panhandling.
  Keith not only tries his hand at panhandling in different ways but he also shows reactions of the people being panhandled with reactions of kindness to hatred.  He also interviews law enforcement on how they try to manage the situations.
  The part of the film that touched me the most were the interviews with the homeless that panhandle to get money to eat and or feed their drug and alcohol addictions.  The film showed that a lot of the panhandlers are down on their luck, have made poor decisions and are going to have a very hard time of getting off the street.
  I like how the filmmakers gave an honest look at the problem and didn't seem to have a hidden agenda.  I think before watching this film I had a harder view on the panhandlers and how they got that way but came away with more of a sadness for their situation and the tough life they lead and the almost hopelessness of getting off the streets.
  It seems like the homeless and just like the rest of society where some are good people and some are bad.  You just can't stereotype the whole group.
  This film will be remembered for a very long time and the thoughts and emotions that it stirred in me.",1290038400,3,1507,4.25
