Men are extinct on Venus and Gamma and Beta, the best pilots in the planet get sent in search of male specimens across the Universe. Rocketship models are mismatched pretty much shot to shot.
The monster 'passengers' are males kidnapped from mars or other planets. An emergency landing is necessary doe to the malfunction of the ""left motor.""  The robot is strangely judgmental of Earth, especially since he is the last surviving being from his planet due to a nuclear war. Robot anticipate Marvin in that he is a walking encyclopedia.

Meanwhile on Earth, Laureano (Piporro) tells tall tales of hunting deer and bear (can't seem to make up his mind which ) among dinosaurs. He is set up as the local liar, is not believed, and very likely we will see reenactment of the Boy who Cried Wolf later on.

Laureano's humor is mostly due to his blustery, trickster, cowardly character. He constantly screws up words sort of like Aks for Ask kind of a thing.

The specimen males are thawed to explain that they are 'guests,' but they will have none of it, they attack the girl pilots and attempt to escape. They are frozen again and taken to a cave for safekeeping while the repairs to the ship are made.

The girls explore the earth and meet Laureano who explains the concept of Love (opportunity for a song to be sung.) One of the girls realizes that love on Earth is voluntary. Both girls decide they want him, but one feels a sense of duty to take him to Venus as part of their mission.

The robot flirts with a jukebox.

The girls are revealed to be space vampires (or one is) after she attacks a human, which a crime punishable by death.  She is found out and is sentenced. She attacks the good girls and takes over the controls of the robot and the ship. The evil girl is revealed to be from Uranus. The flying attack is pretty nifty, the second time they do it it's not so hot, however.

She thaws the monsters, convinces them to work with her to take over the Earth. she send one out to kill all children, one to kill all women, and one to kill all animals. She and the Martian will kill all men (for her to drink their blood.)

A cow is killed and discovered by Laureano. He tracks the killer monster fights him but is too stupid to realise it is actually a monster (he thinks it's someone in disguise.) He goes back to town to report, but is not believed until the robot (under the evil girl's control) goes there to kidnap him.

Name drops Rebel Without a Cause and Burt Lancaster (who the monsters equal in size.)

Laureano is taken to the ship where he sees things are not as they should be, then to the cave to be seduced. Laureano steals the control belt from the evil chick. goes back to the ship and takes off by mistake. He gives the belt to the good girl, they go back to Earth, fight the monsters and win. The vampire girl is impaled and the brain monster's eye is punctured, deflating his brain. Gory.

The robot takes the ship back to Venus with his new found jukebox love, and the good Venusian disobeys orders and stays on Earth.

Trivia: Transporter technology predates Star Trek by 6 years.

The movie ain't that bad. It's probably on a par with Skeleton from Cadavra's production values, but it is a musical comedy after all, and I doubt any of it is meant to be taken seriously. But yes, the monsters are truly ludicrous.",1446422400,2,3354,4.402912621359223

8321248,4,B001MFNB6M,"Ship of Monsters:  Okay, it's low-budget; but they did manage to hire a beautiful woman or two and build a lovely spaceship interior set.  Throw in some effects sequences stolen from the Russian ""Road to the Stars"" and you've got a movie that looks much better than you'd expect.  That said, the hero is just excruciating, like the worst comic-relief character from US '50s sci-fi--think ""Destination Moon"" level of excruciating.",1385164800,2,429,5.1

8321250,4,B001MFNB6M,"I've been a huge fan of the obscure spanish import ""Ship Of Monsters"" ever since I rented a copy from Video Wasteland mail order company way back in the late 90's. I had read about it in the Psychotronic Video Guide, and then I saw a trailer for the movie on one of those Something Weird video trailer compilation tapes. Both the movie and the trailer had very poor image quality, so I always figured this would be one of those forgotten movies that would never see the light of day on dvd. I can't describe how pleasantly shocked I was to find it being offered on Amazon, and released by Lions Gate, of all companies! Even though it's only available in spanish with no english subtitles, the image quality is pristine and flawless. The monsters in the film are silly looking, but the girls are absolute babes, and would be the prime reason for buying the film.",1335139200,5,861,4.455696202531645

8321252,4,B001MFNB6M,"This budget priced DVD-10 from Lionsgate has two Mexican movies starring Lalo Gonzalez: the dramatic El Rata(1966) and the goofy, campy, off-the-wall La Nave de Los Monstruos(1960). Do keep in mind that this DVD has no English subtitles. Let me rephrase...it has no subtitles, period!

El Rata/The Rat(1966): Lalo Gonzalez plays a thief-con artist who hides out in a small town. When he starts to fall in love with a pretty, dark haired, honest schoolteacher(Alma Delia Fuentes), he thinks about putting his crime filled past away and ""turning over a new leaf"". However, it will not be easy as a detective closes in on him! This is a solid Mexican movie from the groovy 1960's.

La Nave de los Monstruos/The Monster Ship(1960): Lalo Gonzalez plays a Charro(Mexican cowboy) who battles a sexy, power hungry-femme fatale-vampire lady(Lorena Velasquez)and an army of gruesome monsters. His only allies are a pretty(and curvy!) humanoid woman(Ana Bertha Lepe)and her robot Thor. This film is honest about the fact that it's cheesy and that's why it's fun to watch...even without English subtitles. I've been crazy about this film ever since I saw it on Dish Network! Lorena Velasquez was so good at playing vampy, femme fatales. She also oozes sex appeal. I spent most of the movie looking at her...""assets""! LNDLM also has stock footage from a Russian sci-fi film and a robot in love with a jukebox! LOL! An English dubbed version of La Nave de Los Monstruos would've been perfect on Mystery Science Theater 3000.

If you're a die hard fan of Mexican movies...and you're willing to put up with a lack of subtitles and DVD extras, this DVD is for you!",1238198400,12,1647,4.91726618705036
