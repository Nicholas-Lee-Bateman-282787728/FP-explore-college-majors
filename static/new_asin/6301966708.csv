384828,5,6301966708,Julie gives the best dramatic performance of her career - she just gives it all and excels in the delivering. I went to the UK opening and I cried and I enjoyed the impact this film had on the audiences. Julie IS the best.,1049414400,9,222,4.068181818181818
384829,5,6301966708,"I frankly don't see why people have overlooked this film or given it bad critiques and reviews. I think it's magnificent. I watched it the very same day I got it, and Ms. Andrews gives a magnificent performance. I foud tears on my own face at times, while Stephanie's struggling with her life. True, I'd never heard Ms. Julie use so much profanity, but everyone does it-she's a human being too. And a very wonderful human being, might I add. I know that in preparing for this role, Ms. Andrews spent time in a hospital, observing those with multiple sclerosis, and she did a wonderufl job portraying Stephanie. Perhaps another reason why I like this movie is because one of my friend's mother has multiple sclerosis. In a way, ""Duet For One"" has helped me to better understand what Kathryn goes through with her mother, who is also wheelchair bound. It must be frightful for someone to see their life ending that way. Anyhoo, the movie's great, and I really recommend it. It's very drammatic, very well done, and Ms. Andrews' performance sparkles.",1019865600,22,1047,4.726775956284153
384830,4,6301966708,"It is so sad that this film remains little seen and little known. Clearly, Julie Andrews gives the best performance of her career (where was the Oscar nomination she deserved?) as a world- class violionist stricken with multiple schlerosis at the height of her career in this film based on a play by Tom Kempinski. Max Von Sydow plays her psychiatrist (scenes between Sydow and Andrews are powerful) and Alan Bates plays her philandering husband. Also features early performances from Rupert Everett and Liam Neeson. A heavy film, and a shattering, dynamic, tour de force  for Julie Andrews.",984182400,22,591,5.030612244897959
384831,5,6301966708,"Julie Andrews gives the performance of her career as a virtuoso violinist stricken with a degenerative and crippling disease, which destroys her complacent life. Tom Kempinski wrote the script from his play giving it greater depth. Alan Bates and Max von Sydow give excellent performances, as they must deal with Andrews as fate takes its toll. A difficult film to watch, but Julie Andrews' performance is so thought provoking that it just makes you stop and take account of things. This 1968 film was produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus and directed in England by Andrei Konchalovsky. Look for a young Liam Neeson.",980812800,16,622,4.990384615384615
384832,4,6301966708,"An understated film about a concert violinist's struggle with the physical and emotional traumas of multiple sclerosis is given life by Julie Andrews' performance, the best dramatic portrayal of her career. Her ability to  reveal the character's motivations, fears and character traits, warts and  all, is illuminating and rewarding, particularly in her scenes with husband  Alan Bates, and protege Rupert Everett.",938649600,11,414,5.754098360655738
7817758,5,6301966708,"Julie Andrews should have received an Oscar for this film. It is the best dramatic performance of her career.  The nicest thing I can say is that while I was watching it for the second or third time, I asked myself, ""Where did Julie Andrews go?""",1498176000,,245,4.326086956521739

7817761,5,6301966708,This movie is one that Julie Andrews gives a superb performance as someone with MS who is a violinist and the disease is creating havoc for her professional career. I have and always will be a huge Julie Andrews fan; there are very few movies she has made that I don't like. I think this movie is one of the most challenging performances she has given.,1407024000,,352,4.348484848484849
7817762,4,6301966708,"When will this be released on DVD! Julie Andrews, in the right director's hands, is capable of brilliance, and this film shows it.  This is a raw performance by Andrews, in which she took risks she rarely took elsewhere (even in the films directed by her husband, who was perhaps not her best director).  There's now a sad parallel in her character's plight and her own life (years after this movie) in that both Stephanie and Andrews each lose the talents that informed their lives and self-images:  Stephanie loses her ability to play the violin (because of MS) and Andrews, about a decade after filming ""Duet"" lost her ability to sing.  It's also sad that the industry didn't recognize Andrews' Oscar-worthy performance in DUET.  If it had, or if the film had landed commercially, I suspect we would have seen Andrews in  more strong, non-singing roles.  But, alas, Andrews never seemed to fight public rejection (witness her leaving the movies for many years after failures in Star! and Darling Lili; Nicole Kidman (and many others) hardly pull roots after two consecutive failures).  Anyway, the movie itself has flaws, but it's also brave in not giving us a typical Hollywood uplifting ending.  Watch it for Julie Andrews' intelligent, gutsy performances.",1197072000,4,1261,4.9952153110047846
7817763,5,6301966708,"Tom Kempinski's play ""DUET FOR ONE"" was originally a two -character drama between Stephanie, a world-famous violinist who is stricken with multiple sclerosis, and her psychiatrist. The film opens the story up considerably to include many people in Stephanie's crumbling life. Julie Andrews' performance as Stephanie is a major dramatic revelation. Max Von Sydow reprises his role from the stage version (very reduced in the film) as her psychiatrist, and Alan Bates plays her philandering musician husband. The scene between Bates and Andrews in the car after a picnic is full of dramatic fireworks and painfully sad.
  The film also features early performances by Rupert Everett as Stephanie's pupil and Liam Neeson as Harry, a man Stephanie has an affair with after her marriage ends. But the film belongs to Julie Andrews, who gives a tour-de-force performance that completely shatters her ""Mary Poppins""/""Sound Of Music"" stereotyped image.
 The film is sometimes dire and often depressing. It also pulls no punches in its brutally honest, realistic portrayal of living with a disability. When her psychiatrist mentions she has choices in life, she responds, ""You're right. There's crippled, very crippled, totally crippled, and dead. I just haven't made up my mind yet."" To her lover Harry she says, ""You like me because I'm a cripple. Come on, admit it, it turns you on. What's your speciality; paraplegics?"" Stephanie does attempt suicide in an especially harrowing scene,  but, thankfully, she is saved by her loyal housekeeper.
  As soul-wrenching as it all is, this overlooked drama is extremely worthwhile-- worth it for the strength of Julie Andrews' performance alone. It's a crime that Andrews did not receive the Academy Award nomination she clearly deserved for her work in this film. I found this film on Amazon Marketplace only on VHS. I hope it will someday be released on DVD.",1182297600,9,1895,5.19672131147541
7817764,5,6301966708,"All of the people who claim that Julie Andrews' acting abilities are limited should sit down and watch this movie (right alongside ""That's Life!""). This is ""mature"" Julie; no longer perky, or goody-two-shoes. This is Julie portraying a woman who literally loses everything (her motor skills; devastating to a violinist, her husband, her best students and ultimately her life). Yes, the movie is a little depressing at times and I concur with some of the other reviewers that Max von Sydow's and Alan Bates' performances were basically phoned in but this movie isn't about them. It's all about Ms. Andrews, and she is magnificent. It is a real shame this movie never opened wide release in the states (I saw it at a tiny art house in Washington DC when it opened). I keep praying that will come out on DVD but I'm not holding my breath. Whatever form you get this in, you absolutely must watch it. The scene of Julie (sick) watching herself on the television (healthy) still gives me the chills. A must-see film by all accounts.",1153094400,5,1027,4.711111111111111
7817765,5,6301966708,"Julie Andrews makes the most robust performances on screen through this vivid, intimate and sadly adaptation based on a true and sensitive testimony of the real life. She is attacked by a degenerative sclerosis that eventually will lead to the grave. She plays the role of a famed violinist (in the real life she was a very talented cellist) who suffers this awful penury, nevertheless she possesses that untamed will, materializing  this epic fight against the destiny. Backstage his husband a director is cheating her with another woman, artist too. Fine performances of Alan Bates and max Von Sydow.",1121990400,6,602,5.08080808080808
7817766,5,6301966708,I give it 5 stars because of Julie Andrews' performance in this movie.  Her acting talents are often overlooked.  The movie is quite depessing and isn't for everyone.  But if you're looking for a powerful movie this one is worth watching.,1120953600,5,238,4.7560975609756095
