I really have no idea what the film is like. This is because the quality of the copy I was sent, at the rip off price of about $25 (Australian) was beyond belief. The sound was inaudible, the picture so scratched and faded it was barely viewable, and the tracking was worse than the worst VHS tape I have ever seen. I counted 6 complete 'blackouts' on screen before I gave up & turned it off. On top of that, the sleeve insert was a crudely and faintly photocopied effort that didn't even fit in the sleeve properly.
It is fit only for the rubbish bin: to post it back to the amateurish vendor would cost even more money. Be warned!!",1260662400,3,719,4.135714285714286
2257024,5,B00082ZVTA,"""Trains have always fascinated me and when I was told that this was a movie about a railroad company, I just had to have a copy. I wasn't disappointed. The director has done a fabulous job of capturing the daily grind of railroad workers and the plot is just out of this world. Unlike other low-budget suspense thrillers, this movie keeps you guessing, not about whodunit, but how it was done, till the very end. Yes, the plot may seem absurd by today's hi-tech standards, but you have to admit that it was far ahead of its time. This timeless classic film is surely worth a second viewing!""",1146441600,8,591,4.481481481481482

8055415,3,B00082ZVTA,"There are other films ,same era, that  give a better view of 1930s railroading,( 'Danger Lights; would be one). "" Phantom Express"" cuts corners by using a 'standard"" gauge TOY TRAIN in some of the footage.... Im not impressed with this one.",1458172800,2,240,4.714285714285714

This film, though fairly low-budget and with near zero ""special effects"", was, however,  enjoyable to me. Not for those who aren't fans of films of the early 30s. ;-)",1407283200,2,301,4.339285714285714
8055419,5,B00082ZVTA,"What a fun little film! A great throwback to 1932.
What I must first warn you is the acting is absolutely horrible.
What makes this film such a treasure is LOADS OF STEAM TRAINS,
And I mean loads. Do you want to have a look at the Southern Pacific Los Angles
roundhouse in 1932? This is the only place you'll find it!

The effects are corny by today's standards but they must have looked spectacular
to a kid at the Saturday matinee in 1932. Thus this film is way ahead of it's time
and worth another look.",1320710400,3,506,4.216494845360825
