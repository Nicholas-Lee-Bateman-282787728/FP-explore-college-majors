4598213,5,B0058D3SRG,"Finally was able to get the trainer out and train to Paceline Cycling in France by Global Ride, and I loved it!
You watch the Alps and beautiful French villages throughout the ride with a choice of the relaxed coaching and banter of Gene and Tom or, Fiona for a different ride perspective (there is also an option for no coaching. It was really nice to have a choice.
I also enjoyed the google map showing us where the ride was taking place, a nice extra feature.
I have enjoyed Global Rides since the first series in Hawaii with the team giving us a wonderful variety of beautiful places to explore while training in the cold, snowy winter here in Wisconsin! From the Dirty Dozen to France, love the rides! Looking forward to more rides in the future!",1350259200,,752,4.456521739130435
8461341,2,B0058D3SRG,This is not a DVD to get for spinning!,1460073600,,38,3.3333333333333335
8461342,2,B0058D3SRG,"I did not expect the jittery video (should have read the other review from a verified purchaser!).  I've only watched 15 minutes of the video and it feels like you are watching an out of focus scenery (due to vibration).  How can someone sell this like this?  The idea is good but this people should check out ""Virtual Active"" and see the excellent quality of their filming!  Only good thing is the scenery itself and the music.  Otherwise, I do not recommend this DVD.  Check out others like Virtual Active or Bike-O-Vision.",1409702400,,525,4.6521739130434785
8461343,3,B0058D3SRG,"boring to spin to. Also the quality of the video is very poor. Thought it was my DVD player at first. It is jittery and hazy. They must have used a poor camera setting while recording. Spinning North Carolina and Southern California are perfect for having a coach in the background and instructions on screen. Reviewed again. Did the complete workout. The problem seems to be in the camera mount it picked up vibration. It is ok if you just want to do an easier spin comparison to the other videos by endurance. originally rated it two stars, upgrading to just three. Has the potential of being better.",1386288000,2,602,4.583333333333333
8461344,5,B0058D3SRG,"I am a competitive, road bike cyclist living in the Midwest.  I have been training indoors during the winter for over 15 years. I discovered riding to the Global Ride Hawaii Series, Italy Series and France Series of DVD training rides last year.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Global-Ride-Paceline-Cycling-in-France-Virtual-Cycling-DVD/dp/B0058D3SRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Global Ride: Paceline,Cycling in France Virtual Cycling DVD</a>, Club Ride and Climbing in France are my favorites.  I like being able to control the ride with multiple coaches and music on/off.  Riding to HR/Cadence/RPE with the ride coach (my favorite is Fiona Ford, a Professional British Triathlete with her own Triathlete coaching company)and scenery makes each ride a bit different.

I have been training to these DVD's (mostly the France series)for two winters, 4 rides a week....never a chore or boring.  I ride to the France Series about 80 indoor miles a week. I like riding to THESE DVDs as much as riding my Colnago bicycles on the outdoor roads (may sound a bit crazy, but it's true).  If your new to indoor cycling, look no further;  The Global Ride DVDs are the best.  If you are a seasoned cyclist, you will not be disappointed.  You get a great ride, monitor your fitness level and really get ready for the outdoor season.

The bonus features are yet another pleasant surprise for indoor fitness.  They offer Yoga, Pilates and Strength sessions depending on the France DVD.",1361491200,2,1505,5.5
8461345,5,B0058D3SRG,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas, and he loves it and I have started to use it too.  Three DVD's, all different, with Fiona Ford the British Triathlon coach giving encouraging and very useful training and cycling tips the whole way through. She references, cadence, heart rate, resistance and cycle position on the bike.  The scenery is a bonus and the hour flies by.  My husband uses them with his trainer and I am using the DVD's with my bike rollers.  It is still effective even on the rollers and pushes you to work harder and for longer.
Would recommend it as an inexpensive way to maintain good cycle fitness during the winter months.",1361491200,,648,4.608695652173913
8461346,5,B0058D3SRG,"I am an indoor cycling instructor and used the Pacelining in France DVD in my last two classes.  The DVD worked well with the 20 minute paceline effort we did in class as well as the twenty minute threshold effort that was preceeded by a five minute recovery effort.  The scenery is beautiful and the ride is very realistic. Eventhough, I do my own coaching of the ride, I listen to the coaching options on the DVD prior to teaching the class to get the excellent coaching cues that I utilize to keep the ride real.  Global Rides does an excellent job with all their DVD's as I own almost all of their virtual rides.  Keep up the good work!!",1361404800,,641,4.316666666666666
8461347,5,B0058D3SRG,I'm a triathlete from the Chicago area and the climate here simply is not the best to ride in the winter. I have an indoor trainer but I've never liked to train indoor. Until now. I've ordered the ride in France and Havaii series. And simply it has changed everything. Suddenly I was able to enjoy the nice summer scenery of France when it was snowing outside. First of all the scenery is great. You have the option to have coaching or music. Sometimes I listen to it sometimes I do not and I just execute my training plan. Before having the CD after 15 minutes I've always asked myself why am I doing this? Now an hour passes and I feel like I want to do another CD. Shipping was very quick also. I've ordered a couple days before Christmas and I've received them in 3 days maybe? Very satisfied with the product/ company.,1361404800,,823,4.316129032258065
8461348,5,B0058D3SRG,Scenery and quality of video is great. Music is inspirational. The coaches talk the whole time. I listened to them the first couple of rides because they have some good tips. However i now ride to just scenery and music and and it takes me and my bike to France.,1361404800,,262,4.26
8461349,5,B0058D3SRG,"As with the other France DVDs beautiful scenery, well presented image as you journey through France.  The music too is great and works really well. I find I can use my natural cadence at all times and the music is encouraging rather than intrusive, even if I am not perfectly on beat.  Quite a lot of road bumps as you do see in France - raised crossings etc, you just can't help getting up off the saddle avoid the bump!  Once you've been through it you know where you are going and you find yourself leaning into the bends and roundabouts - I am completely there for the duration -it is completely absorbing.  Also, with the lovely weather the filming had, you can just feel the sun on your back and the warm air - it's escapism on a bike, especially when there's snow on the ground :-)
My only slight comments on this one are:- the camera image is a bit wobbly in the first few minutes as the road is a bit uneven, but it's not too bad; and the locations jump about a bit from narrow bumpy road to miraculous smooth section, but I guess that is just through necessity on the day.
All in all a fabulous ride with challenging long flat stages.  Thanks to all at Global Rides !",1360627200,,1177,4.236607142857143
8461350,5,B0058D3SRG,"I have the whole France series and all have stunning scenery. I don't get out on weekdays due to the lack of daylight and the winter cold so I was looking for some inspiration to keep me on the trainer during the winter. The France series makes you want to buy a ticket and go there to ride. I've already put it on my bucket list. The videography is well done and mixes in great front, rear, and side shots to keep you focussed. The pre and post ride pictures are beautiful. And the music has a perfect tempo to match with your pedal cadence.  All in all, a very well done series. This video in particular has a great mix of flat roads flanked by towering mountains and some nice little towns thrown in for good measure. The only way you could improve it is if we could all stop and enjoy a coffee at one of the sidewalk cafes along the way.",1360195200,,841,4.128048780487805
