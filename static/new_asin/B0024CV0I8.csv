8350383,5,B0024CV0I8,"The movie is as I remember it. A good quality. The only disappointment I had is that it has no english subtitles, and my German is pretty rusty. But that's my problem, not the DVD's. The delivery was promised for mid-March, but received it nearly a month sooner. Excellent service.",1361836800,,281,4.64
