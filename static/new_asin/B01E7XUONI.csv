7732229,1,B01E7XUONI,Grey's anatomy is over. It would have been a perfect end of series if it had ended on season 11. This new episode is so lame. There is just not enough plot to keep it going.  Save your money and your time.,1443139200,3,205,3.880952380952381

7732274,5,B01E7XUONI,"Grey's Anatomy is a medical drama television show that focuses on a certain group of doctors in the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, previously known as Seattle Grace Hospital. Some pros are that this show really gets the audience attached to certain characters and Shonda Rhimes the creator and writer always keeps you on the edge of your seat. Merideth the main character in the series and her husband Derek Shepard go through many struggles to maintain relationships with their co workers. Grey's is a nonstop nail biter because you never know what will happen next and who will come into the hospital or what doctor will die next because Shondra loves to do that to you. The show also helps you understand some medical terms and how to do basic things if you watch the show enough. I know know that a healthy persons BP is 120/80.

Some Cons on the show is that you cannot get too attached to the characters because in the end they all end up leaving the hospital or dying. Shondra makes it really hard for you to not become attached to the characters. Also sometimes the characters will just leave and you do not get any explanation as to where they went. For example, after her husband died Erica Hahn just stopped showing up on the show and no one ever talks about her anymore so I would really like to know what happened to her and where she is now. Other then that I cannot think of any other problems with the show.

Over all Greys Anatomy is a great show and definitely worth watching if you love to always be kept on the edge of your seat. There is also 13 seasons so you will be watching for a long time unlike some of the other shows that only have 6 or 7 seasons and feel like they are rushed. In Grey's Anatomy nothing is rushed and everything in connected to each somehow.",1490313600,,1786,4.3927492447129906

When I open the package to watch the disks, they all appear to be intact, however, the first disc, has the tendency to skip, and pause on its own. It is really frustrating, being that I bought this product new, and not used. I have had this issue a few times with Amazon now, and I am not sure how I feel about ordering this sort of thing in the future from them. This is at least the third time, that I have had a problem with a new product (discs), but I have had that issue countless times, with other things.

7732341,4,B01E7XUONI,"I came to Grey's Anatomy pretty late and entirely on DVD.  Binge-watching series sets quickly over a matter of days instead of months meant that for me, the rollercoaster ride of the saga of Seattle Grace/Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital and its revolving cast of doctors, nurses, residents and interns was telescoped into a much more intense experience than spooling them out over a period of 12 years.  The show has never been better or more captivating than it was during its first three seasons, when the MAGIC squad of interns (Meredith, Alex, George, Izzy & Christina) were les enfants terribles of surgical medicine in Seattle.  As our interns matured into senior residents with the responsibility of mentoring up-and-coming doctors, the show began to cram in too many incidental/weakly developed characters and began to sacrifice a focus on medical drama at the expense of way too much focus on the sexploits of interchangeable interns who all looked and acted like over-caffeinated high school AP science geeks having a 'Work Experience'.  Chyler Leigh's Lexie Grey, introduced in Season 4 was a rare exception.  Mer's half-sister added some zest to the proceedings before perishing in the plane crash that also killed her colleague and sometime love interest Dr. Mark Sloan (the McSteamy Eric Dane) and prompted a change in the name of our titular medical center.

Despite the overall mediocrity of many of the storylines from Season 4 onwards, Shonda Rimes and her writing team could always be relied upon to have a few standout episodes/arcs in each season that would keep me hooked, even as I groaned at the other not-great parts.  After the conclusion of Season 11, I was ready to give up entirely on this show.  I was not a particular Patrick Dempsey/McDreamy fan; a large percentage of the time I thought Derek was a colossal donkey's butt.  But there were redeeming qualities, besides the Hair to him.  For better or for worse, the saga of MerDer was the anchor of this show and it seemed like removing Derek Shepard from this equation would be a fatal blow to the series.  There is still a feeling of emptiness on account of his loss, not to mention all the other characters that have left us through various tragedies and personal crises.  I threw a party when D-Izzy decamped the scene, but remain inconsolable about the loss of George (T.R. Knight).  Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) was a much more likeable character when she was still attracted to men, in my opinion.  The ensuing CalZona drama after Callie discovered her calling to GyrrlNation has become one of the more tedious elements of this series.  Along with the tedious, repetitive drama represented by Jackson & April and their endless bickering.  They are an illustration of just why missionary dating is a project doomed for abject failure if ever there was one.

In Season 12, though there are additional helpings of the same recycled tedium that we've had before, there are some bright spots to be found.  Dr Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) the 4'11"" powerhouse that has been inspiring fear and awe in interns, residents, her peers AND her bosses since 2004 finally gets her due and becomes the Chief of Surgery.  There is a good storyline for her as she juggles being a wife with being her husband's boss.  There will be Blood.  My personal crumpet, the most unlikely sex object since Hugh Laurie's House, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) is back, and despite the decamping of his ex, Cristina, is getting more lady action than anyone else in the hospital, including the lesbians.  Mr. McKidd (a prolific episode director and a Scot) is joined by another foreign-born, tasty crumpet, Martin Henderson ('Bride & Prejudice', a Kiwi.)  Henderson's Dr. Riggs, a former Army buddy of Owen's presents fresh meat for the badgers of Grey Sloan to chew over, and presents a possible route out of widowhood status for Mer.

To cut a long story short--this season is, while far from the series' dramatic peak, much better than I was prepared for.  This is due to a large degree to the focus pulling back from Meredith, and giving more equal screen time to the other characters.  It's still 'Grey's Anatomy' but Ellen Pompeo is more of an ensemble player now.  This is to the good; I have always felt that Pompeo's range as an actress was not on a par with many of her co-stars.  To me Meredith/Pompeo is very like Carrie Bradshaw/Sarah Jessica Parker on Sex and the City:  heading a large cast as the 'star', she is far less appealing or attractive a character than the supporting players surrounding her, and exudes a near toxic level of thoughtless narcissism.  The loss of the MerDer show has meant that other characters get to stretch their wings from out under its shadow.

Also, with every season, it's always taken a while before the words ""Play All"" come up, so you can hit play, and during the time the intro music always plays - in this season, the intro music is different, and much more pleasant to listen to while waiting for ""Play All"" to be an option.",1473379200,2,586,4.3090909090909095

After so long I thought I would be tired but boy...no. Shonda Rhimes you deliver girl. Please as much as I like Bailey please we don't have to see her love scenes. The actress herself looks so uncomfortable that it spoils it way too much please stop.

7732450,1,B01E7XUONI,"I really can't even give this season more stars because it wwe so awful. I've watched every single episode of the show more than once and am a longterm fan of the show, but s12 took away all my excitement for the show. We all love Meredith, or used to until they changed her personality in season 11, but this huge focus on her when the show also has 15 other series regulars is just not working. How are other characters ever gonna get their storylines to be told well if they don't get the focus they need? I am a huge Alex fan and maybe he and Jo were the characters who were affected by this the most and that's why I'm so bitter about it, but I'm just not happy seeing him get degraded to being the supportive best friend who has nothing going on for himself anymore. It became most evident in the finale when Owen got remarried again (he married Cristina after Alex already got divorced) and when Jackson became a father. Both of them have been on the show half as long as Alex but the writers allow them their own life and they don't have to rush to console Meredith everytime she has a hard time (which let's face it, happens nearly every episode). Plus I'm still not a huge Maggie or Amelia fan and don't like what this show has become ever since Cristina left and they joined. And Penny received way too much attention and development when other characters like Jo could have used that. It was clear from the start that Penny would never stay but we had to watch so much of her and she turned out to be quite the waste of screentime. I just miss equal treamtent of characters this show once had. It became clear last season who Shonda's favorites are and they are the ones who get all the screentime while other characters are suffering.",1466208000,2,1747,4.313069908814589

Sad that Sara Ramirez is leaving this year, but can't wait for Season 13. Amazing writing/acting is why after everyone wrote this show off with the death of Derek in Season 11, this show leads ABC in ratings including beating the ratings for Scandal and HTGAWM all year and actually INCREASED its ratings this season.

I don't like the couples Jo and Alex or Amelia and Owen (poor guy can never seem to find a woman who loves him the way he needs it) or Miranda and Ben and the Jackson and April storyline is trying.  The characters need to grow and start experiencing things outside of the hospital.  Maybe have a character or former character write a tell-all or one of the doctors become famous or a reality star.

They are just way too intense these days. ALL the characters are WAY too uptight. GEZZ! But then - I do miss the good ole days when everyone was mostly happy getting laid in the on-call room.

A week after finishing season 11, I'm still devastated that they would kill Derek off so quickly and without much closure.  I just kept praying that Merideth would wake up from her 5 o'clock 'freak out' and it would have all been just her thinking of the worst case scenario.  I guess I still keep wishing it would happen, after all, we did go through a year and a half worth of time in a few short episodes, why not go backward too!  Although it felt like the series would go on forever previously, now I'm not so sure.  I don't think it will ever be the same, but I do still love most of the characters, so for me it's still worth watching for now...",1458950400,,735,4.111888111888112

I hate to think the series is running out of steam because it has been such great TV.  I will continue to watch through this season and see what happens.

7732667,1,B01E7XUONI,"The show lacks something that it used to have. I have been watching it from the beginning on Life Time. The story lines, the inter action of the characters and the plots, always fast moving and going some place. Every character was involved.
I love the show but it is getting tired and saggy. Unless it gets perked up, I do not think it will make it. Some characters should be brought back. Christina is one. Izzie is another. There should be a new class of inters and let the show revolve around them for a while like it did from the beginning with George, Alex, Christina, Meredith and Izzie.
Right now there are no story lines for many characters. As much as I dislike Catherine, Jackson's mother, she married Richard. Where is she?
Stephanie is nothing. Just there. Alex and Jo need more of a story line. Joe and his bar should never have been dropped. It was a nice place for gatherings of the characters.
Callie, her new woman the doctor who accidentally killed Derrick shephard. He died and his other sisters who were in previous episodes did not come for the funeral. Not realistic. It is not believable.
There should be a story line about 2 gay men, doctors, interns, whatever.
I think you get my points. Unless you get a stick of dynamite and burst the show open, it is on the critical list. I do not want it to end BUT...................
How about Addison comng back. A new doctor to head psychiatry and revolve characters abd stories around that field.",1456617600,3,1464,4.528301886792453

And we even had a few unresolved issues in the 1st half to follow up on. Still good but not like the first 6-7 seasons. 17 characters have died so far - too many! C'mon Shonda, give us a break. By the way I miss Christina most of all. Maybe she could do a few guest spots? After all, despite Alex being there Christina is still Meredith's ""person "". Still wondering why Meredith hasn't gone to Switzerland for a visit? I know Sandra Oh wanted to leave but just a few guest appearances? She is critical to the show - in my opinion.

7732734,2,B01E7XUONI,"I used to love this show, but now it's just... well, annoying really. Meredith is too mean, too petty, and too self-important, but I've kind of thought that for a while now. She's never been believable as a mother, but McDreamy balanced it out. With both him and Christina gone, there's nothing even remotely interesting or relatable about her - which is a shame, because she used to be. April is just flat-out annoying, the interns squabble like elementary children, she-Shepherd seems to have zero self-respect, and I no longer see how there's even a remote possibility these characters are actual doctors working in an actual hospital. Pierce is obviously just a substitute for Lexie, and Maggie a poor attempt at replacing Christina as Owen's love interest.

Save yourself the money - don't bother purchasing past season 10, 'cause it's dribble. The last of the great characters left when Christina did, but honestly? Rhimes' first mistake was getting rid of Burke. Then O'Malley. Then Sloan and Lexie. She just capped it off with Christina and Derek. The only true improvement beyond the third season was the departure of Izzie (because Sloan and Lexie weren't improvements, they were legacies in the making that became part of the heart of GA).

And I guess that's what is missing in the last two seasons - heart. Seriously, don't bother wasting your money.",1449878400,,1363,4.9475982532751095

7732755,2,B01E7XUONI,"They really lost something on this show when they got rid of both Christina and Derek. The women sound whiny, the show has lost its focus and its magic. There was real chemistry between these characters and now there are a lot of characters I just don't care about (April, Maggie, Joe, Amelia) or I find annoying. If Rhimes was going to dramatically change the show then she should have changed it. Instead she keeps the same tone and jingoism but without the characters who made that seem relevant. Maggie's ""OMG I slept with an intern"" is old and she's too old to whine on about it like some teenager. The patient-doctor stories are recycled, the jingoism is recycled and the show lacks enthusiasm. I think Rhimes should just bring it to an end before it totally loses its integrity. I used to really really LOVE this show and I really cared about the characters and now I'm verging on indifference. I will no longer buy a season pass but will wait until it all comes out on Netflix if I bother to remember it. Also Amazon is off its game, sometimes it gives you the new season pass episode and sometimes that episode is just not there even after it aired. Happened with Fear The Walking dead one time and its happened this season 2x's. Kind of sick of that too.",1447977600,6,1264,4.452586206896552

I'm from Maine, and appreciate all Patrick Dempsey has done and does for a nearby hospital.  I definitely miss his character, and I do not review tv shows...this is a first.  The writers have their work cut out for them, as Derek, Christina, Izzy, George, Lexi, and Mark were well written characters given life by very good actors.  Meredith is my favorite, and I love her acting as a Mom...doctor, friend, all her scenes.  Only one story did not ring true for me.  I did not like the way Izzy's storyline ended.

7732854,3,B01E7XUONI,"Please let this be the last season.  I'm too invested in the series to quit now, but it's a shell of its former self.  The folks of this hospital have been subjected to shootings, a bombing, a plane crash, an earth quake, a ferry crash, being hit by a bus, being hit by a semi truck, and the list goes on.  To say it's way past ridiculous is the understatement of the century.",1443398400,8,376,4.123287671232877

8757987,3,B01E7XUONI,First season without Derrick Sheppard. It was strange in the beginning of few epsiodes but after that and during the rest of the season I came tp see Grey remained strong and got better with great stories after Derrick death. I  wish Addision (Derrick ex) had returns for his funeral and  few epsiodes this season for Addision and Meredit remembering Derrick. There was a huge void with Patrick Dempsey left.,1527638400,,408,4.814285714285714
