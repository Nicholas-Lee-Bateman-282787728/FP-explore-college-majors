3069967,5,B0011VR6QI,"Probaly my most favorite series from the 60s was THE MAN FROM UNCLE (with THE WILD WILD WEST) and season 1 was the benchmark,never to be bettered!
The glorious hues of black and white filming,mixed with terrific actors,  intelligent scripts and Jerry Goldsmiths great music makes this a must have!
Stand out episodes THE MAD MAD TEA PARTY AFFAIR,THE DEADLY DECOY AFFAIR,THE LOVE AFFAIR,I could go and list the entire season!
Dont judge this series on the terrible 3rd season,get season 1 and see it in all its glory!",1269475200,,516,4.797752808988764
3069968,5,B0011VR6QI,"This DVD brings back so many fabulous memories of watching the early years of this show. All I wanted was ILYA though I was much too young. But we all bought black turtlenecks,and looked cool. Live those days again with this generation,say it's ""Ducky""Mallard from NCIS( they refer to his early days quite often on the show)",1265846400,2,324,4.701754385964913
3069969,5,B0011VR6QI,"I rarely leave reviews. But.... This was a real trip back to the 60s!
I thoroughly enjoyed the wit and humor of this ol' timey spy series.
The two main stars Robert Vaughn as ""Napoleon Solo"" and David McCallum as
""Illym Kuryakin"" were superb. And the guest stars - fantastic.
For examples just a few ...
Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner in ""The Project Strigas affair""
and Kurk Russell as a child guest star in ""The Finny Foot Affair"".

Best of all the quality was very good with an added bonus that you don't
get very often in the 60's series reissue - ENGLISH CAPTIONS.
This way I didn't miss ANY of the humorus banter!!

Best Christmas present I've gotten in a long time. Can't wait to get Season 2.",1262995200,,703,4.4
3069970,4,B0011VR6QI,"This is a TV series from my youth (60's).  NCIS is my favortie TV show now and David McCallum is one of the regular cast members on it.  He stars as Dr. Donald Mallard, aka ""Duckie"", and was a star in The Man From U.N.C.L.E.  My interest in NCIS brought this series to mind and I ordered it so my husband and I could watch it together.  We enjoyed it and have since bought several other old series.  This was made during the ""spy craze"" years and is entertaining.  It is simple, as the shows were then, but the plot holds your interest.  Some may say it's corny, but if taken in context of those years it isn't.  I would recommend it for anyone with an interest in days gone by.",1240185600,,678,4.122137404580153
3069971,4,B0011VR6QI,I recieved my order quicker than I expected in perfect condition.  I'm very satisfied with the product and the entire transaction. I wouldn't hesitate making future purchases from this seller. Thank You.,1218672000,,203,5.34375
3069972,5,B0011VR6QI,"This is a good as any entre into this entertaining TV spy series. Time-Life has done a superb job with the remastering of these episodes, and the interviews with cast and crew are insightful, entertaining, informative, and most welcome. One hopes this quality is indicative of future releases.  Later, this year the entire series will be available via Amazon in a ""suitcase"" carry all for the serious collector.

First making its debut on NBC back in 1964, this series capitalized (like so many others of its type) on the spy-thiller boom that proliferated in the cinema and on the television set. Easily making heroes and stars of Robert Vaughn and David McCallum as United Network Command for Law Enforcement (UNCLE) agents Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuraykin respectively, (Yes, a Russian and American working together at the height of the Cold War!)they fought a top secret, world wide criminal organization bent on global domination, THRUSH, not unlike the familiar SPECTRE from the Bond films. The series features no-less than a who's who of popular celebrities from the 1960's, many from Hollywood's A-list at the time.

With weaponry that was futuristic and plots that were imaginative and clever, the dialogue and mood of the series was fun and tongue-in-cheek. Clearly an imitator of Ian Fleming's James Bond adventures and extremely popular with with college audiences, it had a solid, profitable four year run that spawned a host of imitators on the movie and television screen--not to mention a slew of toys and books for the commercial market. An unsuccessful and feminist-leaning spinoff, ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E."" starring Stephanie Powers as April Dancer debuted in 1966, but only lasted one season and was completely forgotten never catching the magic or the ratings of the original.",1210291200,9,1799,5.154109589041096
3069973,5,B0011VR6QI,"It took a lot but the spy show -- after James Bond --  that triggered the explosion of secret agents on the small screen is finally available.  I got it through Time-Life (all 4 seasons in a attache case with the U.N.C.L.E. emblem). Robert Vaughn as the suave Napoleon Solo, David McCallum as the mysterious Illya Kuryakin, Leo G. Carroll as Mr. Waverly.  The first season was the best.  Handled by Sam Rolfe (HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL), filmed in b&w, season 1 has guest stars like Robert Culp, Ricardo Montalban, Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner (both appear in the same episode, THE STRIGAS AFFAIR), even a very young Kurt Russell.  Season One had the right mix of humor and action.  Season Two would be the height of the series popularity.  Season Three would really suck.  Season Four would be a game try at returning to what had made the show work in the beginning, but it was too late.  Half-way through the season the series was cancelled (to be replaced by ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN).",1208736000,4,988,4.632183908045977
3069974,5,B0011VR6QI,"All four seasons are finally here on DVD with plenty of extras.  As noted elsewhere each season is packaged in one multi-disc set with a nice 4 page flyer listing the shows and actual presentation dates, as well as commentary on the season.  Some here (and elsewhere) have complained about the pastboard briefcase that the full four season set is presented in, but I find it to be clever and handy.  If you possibly can, buy all four seasons in one package rather than individually.

The transfers are quite good, much better than the vhs sets that were out many years back.  The video and the audio is clean with few drop-outs or glitches noted (so far), but best of all the show holds up well.  Those who loved it then will be entranced.  Our children may find the show less amazing, as many of the gadgets envisioned then are really now in existence and the Bond series has so far surpassed the 1960's, but for those of us who were there, it is wonderful.

It's a shame that you can get it only from Time-Life or used at this time.  Many garbage series from the 1980's and 1990's are getting better treatment than this treasure.  Find it, buy it  and enjoy it.  You will not be disappointed.",1206748800,18,1194,4.426605504587156
3069975,5,B0011VR6QI,"Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) - Suave, seductive, and trained to kill. An American with only one weakness, Women.
Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum) - Mysterious, calculating, and deadly efficient. A Russian with a temper and a great mind.

Together they are the MEN from U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) together with their boss Alexander Waverly (Leo G. Carroll). They are highly trained spies with one purpose: to stop evil, and charm their way into our hearts. And their arch-enemy is an organisation called THRUSH (Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity). THRUSH is a supra-nation and an antithetical organization to U.N.C.L.E, whose inflexible purpose is to dominate the earth.

One problem though was that Illya Kuryakin (David) is just a co starring actor to the famous Napoleon Solo (Robert), but as the season goes on so does their partnership. Together they have a wicked sense of humor and luck like no other. If you like action shows with two of the most stunning men of the 60's, with great acting and stunning guest appearenses, this is a show for you.

This season features all the 29 episodes in 11 cd's, starting with ""The Vulcan Affair"" and end with ""The Odd Man Affair"". The box also includes ""The Cloak and Swagger Affair"": The untold history of The man from U.N.C.L.E., ""Solo"": The original colour plot and ""Bonus feautures"": U.N.C.L.E. VIP's, a celebration to the guest stars of the show.",1202860800,53,1484,5.048979591836734
3069976,5,B0011VR6QI,"After all the legal intricacies, negotiations, and more time than it took to make a commitment to land a man on the moon and then accomplish it - they are finally here - the U.N.C.L.E. dvd's!  I must admit that the complete collection is really nicely packaged, the quality of each episode is enhanced with a minimum of blemishes, and the extras are numerous and all-inclusive.  The first season set provides some wonderful background with ""The Cloak and Swagger Affair"". The movie ""One Spy Too Many"" is also captured as an extra in the second season.  The interviews with Robert Vaughn and David McCallum are both wonderful and insightful.  THRUSH had better take note; ""bad guys"" of the world - time to go underground after forty years, cause' the boys are finally back in town.

For any armchair U.N.C.L.E. agent from the 60's, these are an answer to a prayer - but, why not wish for the rest of the U.N.C.L.E. movies like ""To Trap A Spy"", ""The Spy With My Face"", and the others?  Hello-o-o out there!  And, then there's The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.!

It will be interesting to see when all of the U.N.C.L.E. dvd's are finally available in stores.  I simply couldn't wait once I found that the entire set was available.  From every beat of Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful instrumentals to the wickedly charming wit of the collective efforts of the production/writing staff behind U.N.C.L.E.'s creative brain trust, this announcement is huge.  It takes a little time to get the word out since the signal has to bounce off Telstar!

UPDATE: Great news!  There is a confirmation that all of the U.N.C.L.E. movies are being released in one package as of August 23, 2011 - as well as the Girl from U.N.C.L.E. TV episodes - also all-inclusive, with all episodes.  Keep your eye on this latest development to complete your U.N.C.L.E. files!  There are additions to the movies including some ""hot scenes"" from ""The Vulcan Affair"" - too hot for TV!  This is definitely an U.N.C.L.E. Affair to remember.",1202342400,29,1988,4.769005847953216

3070154,5,B0011VR6QI,"The Man from UNCLE 1st television season, under the executive production of Sam Rolfe, the creator, not developer, of this television series, is SUPERB.  It is the best plausible SpyFi ever.  The 3 leading men: Robert Vaughn (Napoleon Solo), David McCallum (Illya Kuryakin) & Leo G. Carrol (Alexander Weaverly), were perfectly selected for their roles.  Together they made an excellent & very enjoyable team.  They worked very well together & it showed,  They each had a perfect style for their character which was unique.  Under Sam Rolfe all the 1st season 29 episodes were written as serious SpyFi.  Plausible stories & villains.  And very COOL, intelligent & witty heroes.  The gadgets added a lot.  The special Man from UNCLE pistol that could be converted into a carbine (small rifle) as needed, the world-wide communicators, the ""door opening items"" & the very cool Del Floria ""secret"" UNCLE entrance (among others), & very neat filming tactics.  All these added to the UNCLE coolness.  But above all Vaughn & McCallum were what made this TV series a unique HIT.  Never has any other come close to the uniqueness & greatness of the 1st season of UNCLE.  Unfortunately Sam Rolfe left the series after the 1st season & it showed in the writing & production.  But the superb performances of Vaughn & McCallum & Carrol, kept the series going for a total of 3.5 seasons.  This is truly an exceptional timeless TV series.  I strongly recommend it, especially if you like SpyFi.",1454025600,,1478,4.895161290322581

However, now as when I was a child, I still believe the plots frequently lack continuity and depend on many assumptions by the viewer to fill in undeveloped plot which  are unclear at times and the action sequences are the worst I have ever seen in my extensive viewing history. LOL otherwise, it is a fun experience to watch these episodes as you refamiliarize with these characters and enjoy the mid-1960s again. Personally, I would not plan on buying any more of the series as this was to verify my less than perfect opinion which I had since childhood - I was right, unfortunately.

3070250,4,B0011VR6QI,"During the 60's there was an explosion of spy shows influenced by the popularity of James Bond and the Cold War. ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" was one of the best shows of the lot particularly during the first two seasons where it embraced the more serious one of the Bond films right down to the one liners. Ian Fleming contributed to the creation of ""U.N.C.L.E."" although he is not credited due to his contractual obligation to the Bond films. Sam Rolfe (who created ""Have Gun-Will Travel"")  was brought on board to develop the series and write the pilot as well as other episodes and as a supervising producer on the series. He left after the first season was completed. Originally titled ""Mr. Solo"" the series was unusual in that it also featured David McCallum as a Russian agent working with his American counterpart Napoleon Solo.

Most folks known the premise but I will give a very brief description of the series; Napoleon Solo  (Robert Vaughn) and Ilya Kuryakin (David McCullum)/ work for the United Network Command for Law Enforcement fighting an evil organization that threatens the balance of world power and peace called T.H.R.U.S.H.  This requires the two to travel the world protecting secrets regardless of national borders and preventing war between various nations. Their boss is Mr. Waverly (played by the marvelous, late Leo G. Carroll).

An interestingly bit of trivia--the first episode is named ""The Vulcan Affair"" and, later in the series, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy co-star in the ninth episode ""The Project Strigas Affair"". Seems like ""Star Trek"" was meant to be for them.

The first season was shot in black and white and the transfers here are pretty good although the series cold have used a bit of cleaning up (these were mastered back in 2006 or so) as there are various imperfections in the image but they are minor. There is a rather loud popping sound on the soundtrack during the credits that should have been corrected for the first episode of season one. Other than that, the set looks and sounds very good. I do wonder if there is a Blu-ray release pending. The show was shot in color but the final broadcast film masters were in black and white and that's what we get here. I'm oping that, at some point, Warner discovers the original MGM color masters but I doubt they exist at this stage.

The tone of the first season matches shows like ""Secret Agent Man"" (the retitled UK import ""Danger Man"") starring Patrick McGoohan although there is wry one liners and moments provided by Vaughn, McCallum and Carroll that nicely compliment the episodes. By the third season, the tone drifted into parody due to shows like ""Batman"" where camp was king. The series was limping badly quality wise at that time but still was doing fairly well in the ratings. By the time of the fourth season, the series made an attempt to return  the more serious tone of the first two seasons.

We don't get any extras in this stand alone release (although there were extras in the original boxed set) but Warner has wisely only put three episodes per disc which allows for maximum bit rate for the shows and the best quality

This is a nice release and the series stands up remarkably well 50 plus years later.

Smart move, so audiences can (re)visit the classic TV show, before the big-screen version is released a few days later.

The trio from ""U.N.C.L.E.""
Author's collection
We can all go on those wonderful adventures all over the world populated by some of the oddest characters from any show. Spies, gadgets, gizmos and a host of guest stars teach how to blow up the world in under an hour, which all of the bad guys here seem intent on doing.

In this hit spoof of the omnipresent spy thrillers of the period (think Bond . . . James Bond), top secret agents Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin save the world weekly in 29 episodes. Remember hearing the fights and screams, and seeing the bruises and scratches, resulting from heated arguments between high-school ladies over the attractions of one spy (Solo, played by dapper Robert Vaughn) over the other (Kuryakin, played by boyish David McCallum). Some, prefering a guy more mature, simply choose Leo G. Carroll, who, as Alexander Waverly, kept the guys in a never ending battle against evil, chaos, crime and bad taste.

The guest stars can be pretty cool: Fritz Weaver, William Marshall, Carroll O'Connor, Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner in the same pre-""Star Trek"" show, and, of course, the ever lovely Roger Corman icon Tura Satana, all bosom and bravura, in the episode called ""The Finny Foot Affair.""

These suspenseful black-and-white mini masterpieces are a true gas. Add a little suspense and fun to your life and pick up this collection. You'll be crying for more ""U.N.C. L.E.""",1438214400,7,1706,4.872413793103449
3070270,5,B0011VR6QI,"Five stars for the first season only. One star for the other seasons. It was actually two different shows, the first season and the other three which were silly and poorly written. Think Adam West and batman for seasons 2 and 3. Sam Rolfe, the creator and producer left the show after the first season and for me the show ended. The first season was a drama with some ironic humor. It was not meant to be a spoof of James Bond, which for some strange reason, first year reviewers of them show labeled it. Watch the Vulcan Affair pilot's opening scene where there's an assault on uncle headquarters which ends with the iconic shattered glass scene, with Solo killing the intruder. I have no,idea how that was labeled a spoof. Get Smart was a spoof. Solo and Ilya were average sized men and used their wits more than muscle. The first year basically has smart scripts with wit and style. The music was by Jerry Goldsmith, Mortion Stevens , Walter Scharf, Lalo Schriffin. Think themes from Mission Impossible, and Hawaii five 0. Goldsmith theme from the first season was absolutely great. Unfortunately it was also redone with an inferior arrangement each additional season. Go figure. And the scores of the episodes became terrible organ music and bongos. It sounded just like the Addams Family and the Batman series.

Solo originally was a smart professional . Later seasons turned into greasy skirt chaser, instead of the sophisticated ,witty person of the first season. Uncle became a comedy after season 1. Drama can have humor but not comedy. Look at some of the quest stars in later seasons. Bill Dana, Sonny and Cher, Shelly Berman, Sherry Lewis, Harvey Lembeck, and others. Solo went from the drama of the Vulcan Affair to dancing the Watusi with a gorilla , man in a gorilla suit that is.

After all these years, the first season holds up well and some episodes are great , and the remaining seasons are as bad as I remember. I still remember how disappointed I was as a teenager to see what they are done to my all time favorite show.
If you loved Roger Moore as Bond instead of Connery or Craig you might like seasons 2,3,4. Otherwise save you money and watch the terrific first season only.",1438041600,3,2200,4.638461538461539

She really liked Man From Uncle and she would let me watch the show on her family's larger-sized TV (which if I recall was in a nice wooden cabinet, too.) I believe this and ""The Deadly Games Affair"" and ""The Green Opal Affair"" were three of the shows I saw at her house. The Deadly Games Affair scared me a little all those years ago, and it still bothers me even today. But that may be the only episode I don't like. I think I saw some episodes on my family's TV too but our TV set was of poor quality. It was better to ask Joan if I could watch on her TV.

3070310,4,B0011VR6QI,"I grew up on this show and the first season, in black and white, was the best season because of ace producer/writer Sam Rolfe who won an Oscar for his writing and later gave us Have Gun Will Travel.  Starting in season two UNCLE became Batman, the TV series.  This first season was down to Earth and had contributions from writer in residence Allan Caillou who was with British Intelligence during WWII behind the lines in Libya, Tunisia and Yugoslavia.  He also served in two law enforcement organizations.  Also impressive were some of the Directors including Richard Donner and Boris Segal.  There was humor, but it was subtle.  The show was actually more dramatic than the slapstick humor found in the third season.

The first season is in B/W , because networks didn't change to color till 1965-1966 . The shows has lots of soon to be stars in guess spots .

fan of classic TV shows and Vaughn and Mc Cullum who had a great show in the 70's The Invisible Man. Both are great actors and made
a great team. The more I watch the more I love this show. The shows are well written with great stories and wit and humor thrown in. I

You have to ignore the passage of time and just enjoy it for what it is: quality entertainment. You don't dismiss Beethoven's music because of how old it is, do you? Quality artistic acheivement survives the test of time.

3070328,5,B0011VR6QI,"The first season is all black abd white but don't let that stop you.  This series is great, well, at least the first season is great.  Many episodes were directed by Richard Donner (the Omen, Superman, Lethal Weapon). One episode was directed by John Newland (One Step Beyond).  The legion of guest stars is astounding.  Willian Shatner and Leonard Nimoy together in an episode long before Star Trek.  Richard Kiel (Jaws).  Sharon Tate, Kurt Russel, the list just goes on and on.

Man from Uncle reminds me of the English series The Avengers.  Napoleon Solo is a bit like John Steed, an anachronistic representative of a earlier era, always well dressed, but a very professional spy.  Another parallel is how a big time spy agency sends just two agents into situations that would seem to benefit from much more man power.  And like The Avengers, Man from Uncle eventually self-destructed by getting too silly.  But that happens later.  Season one is very good.

It's a period piece now, showing life in the early sixties and this is part of the charm.  Because it was intended fot TV in the 60's, the violence is kept to a minimum. Don't expect the kind of violence that you see on today's show, it isn't there.  Man From Uncle, Season 1 is one of the best TV series from the early 60's offered by Amazon.  I highly recommend it.",1364169600,37,1329,4.591489361702128

The series is almost 50 years old and the production values look it. Also, I have no interest in owning any of the episodes.

First Season. Even thou it is in B&W the First Season stuck to a serious action series without all the corniness that the subsequent seasons had that killed it as a series.

The major reason that the First Season is so good is that the Writer and Producer Sam Rolfe kept it on track. He left at the end of the First Season and the quality dropped in subsequent seasons.  Towards the  end the series tried to reverse the corny trend to serious action scripts, but it was too late. Old adage, if something works, let it be. Enjoy Season I and try to get it for $48 gift given me and not the $75 for a used copy or over $100 plus for a new copy out there.",1324857600,,1007,4.153846153846154

This is the black and white season when Sam Rolfe produced the show
(he left after season one). U.N.C.L.E. had subtle tounue in cheek humor
that put it light years ahead of other shows that followed in its wake.
The two hour ""Solo"" pilot, which is an elongated version of episode one,
""The Vulcan Affair"", makes me wish this had been America's first view of the show.
Instead, it was released as ""To Trap A Spy"" in movie theaters in 1966.

The two main stars Robert Vaughn as ""Napoleon Solo"" and David McCallum as

For examples just a few ...
Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner in ""The Project Strigas affair""
and Kurk Russell as a child guest star in ""The Finny Foot Affair"".

Best of all the quality was very good with an added bonus that you don't

My interest in NCIS brought this series to mind and I ordered it so my husband and I could watch it together.  We enjoyed it and have since bought several other old series.  This was made during the ""spy craze"" years and is entertaining.  It is simple, as the shows were then, but the plot holds your interest.

3304469,5,B0011VR6QI,"This is a good as any entre into this entertaining TV spy series. Time-Life has done a superb job with the remastering of these episodes, and the interviews with cast and crew are insightful, entertaining, informative, and most welcome. One hopes this quality is indicative of future releases.  Later, this year the entire series will be available via Amazon in a ""suitcase"" carry all for the serious collector.

First making its debut on NBC back in 1964, this series capitalized (like so many others of its type) on the spy-thiller boom that proliferated in the cinema and on the television set. Easily making heroes and stars of Robert Vaughn and David McCallum as United Network Command for Law Enforcement (UNCLE) agents Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuraykin respectively, (Yes, a Russian and American working together at the height of the Cold War!)they fought a top secret, world wide criminal organization bent on global domination, THRUSH, not unlike the familiar SPECTRE from the Bond films. The series features no-less than a who's who of popular celebrities from the 1960's, many from Hollywood's A-list at the time.

With weaponry that was futuristic and plots that were imaginative and clever, the dialogue and mood of the series was fun and tongue-in-cheek. Clearly an imitator of Ian Fleming's James Bond adventures and extremely popular with with college audiences, it had a solid, profitable four year run that spawned a host of imitators on the movie and television screen--not to mention a slew of toys and books for the commercial market. An unsuccessful and feminist-leaning spinoff, ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E."" starring Stephanie Powers as April Dancer debuted in 1966, but only lasted one season and was completely forgotten never catching the magic or the ratings of the original.",1210291200,9,1799,5.154109589041096
3304470,5,B0011VR6QI,"It took a lot but the spy show -- after James Bond --  that triggered the explosion of secret agents on the small screen is finally available.  I got it through Time-Life (all 4 seasons in a attache case with the U.N.C.L.E. emblem). Robert Vaughn as the suave Napoleon Solo, David McCallum as the mysterious Illya Kuryakin, Leo G. Carroll as Mr. Waverly.  The first season was the best.  Handled by Sam Rolfe (HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL), filmed in b&w, season 1 has guest stars like Robert Culp, Ricardo Montalban, Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner (both appear in the same episode, THE STRIGAS AFFAIR), even a very young Kurt Russell.  Season One had the right mix of humor and action.  Season Two would be the height of the series popularity.  Season Three would really suck.  Season Four would be a game try at returning to what had made the show work in the beginning, but it was too late.  Half-way through the season the series was cancelled (to be replaced by ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN).",1208736000,4,988,4.632183908045977
3304471,5,B0011VR6QI,"All four seasons are finally here on DVD with plenty of extras.  As noted elsewhere each season is packaged in one multi-disc set with a nice 4 page flyer listing the shows and actual presentation dates, as well as commentary on the season.  Some here (and elsewhere) have complained about the pastboard briefcase that the full four season set is presented in, but I find it to be clever and handy.  If you possibly can, buy all four seasons in one package rather than individually.

The transfers are quite good, much better than the vhs sets that were out many years back.  The video and the audio is clean with few drop-outs or glitches noted (so far), but best of all the show holds up well.  Those who loved it then will be entranced.  Our children may find the show less amazing, as many of the gadgets envisioned then are really now in existence and the Bond series has so far surpassed the 1960's, but for those of us who were there, it is wonderful.

It's a shame that you can get it only from Time-Life or used at this time.  Many garbage series from the 1980's and 1990's are getting better treatment than this treasure.  Find it, buy it  and enjoy it.  You will not be disappointed.",1206748800,18,1194,4.426605504587156
3304472,5,B0011VR6QI,"Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) - Suave, seductive, and trained to kill. An American with only one weakness, Women.
Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum) - Mysterious, calculating, and deadly efficient. A Russian with a temper and a great mind.

Together they are the MEN from U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) together with their boss Alexander Waverly (Leo G. Carroll). They are highly trained spies with one purpose: to stop evil, and charm their way into our hearts. And their arch-enemy is an organisation called THRUSH (Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity). THRUSH is a supra-nation and an antithetical organization to U.N.C.L.E, whose inflexible purpose is to dominate the earth.

One problem though was that Illya Kuryakin (David) is just a co starring actor to the famous Napoleon Solo (Robert), but as the season goes on so does their partnership. Together they have a wicked sense of humor and luck like no other. If you like action shows with two of the most stunning men of the 60's, with great acting and stunning guest appearenses, this is a show for you.

This season features all the 29 episodes in 11 cd's, starting with ""The Vulcan Affair"" and end with ""The Odd Man Affair"". The box also includes ""The Cloak and Swagger Affair"": The untold history of The man from U.N.C.L.E., ""Solo"": The original colour plot and ""Bonus feautures"": U.N.C.L.E.

I must admit that the complete collection is really nicely packaged, the quality of each episode is enhanced with a minimum of blemishes, and the extras are numerous and all-inclusive.  The first season set provides some wonderful background with ""The Cloak and Swagger Affair"". The movie ""One Spy Too Many"" is also captured as an extra in the second season.  The interviews with Robert Vaughn and David McCallum are both wonderful and insightful.  THRUSH had better take note; ""bad guys"" of the world - time to go underground after forty years, cause' the boys are finally back in town.

For any armchair U.N.C.L.E. agent from the 60's, these are an answer to a prayer - but, why not wish for the rest of the U.N.C.L.E. movies like ""To Trap A Spy"", ""The Spy With My Face"", and the others?  Hello-o-o out there!  And, then there's The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.!

It will be interesting to see when all of the U.N.C.L.E. dvd's are finally available in stores.  I simply couldn't wait once I found that the entire set was available.  From every beat of Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful instrumentals to the wickedly charming wit of the collective efforts of the production/writing staff behind U.N.C.L.E.'s creative brain trust, this announcement is huge.  It takes a little time to get the word out since the signal has to bounce off Telstar!

3304651,5,B0011VR6QI,"The Man from UNCLE 1st television season, under the executive production of Sam Rolfe, the creator, not developer, of this television series, is SUPERB.  It is the best plausible SpyFi ever.  The 3 leading men: Robert Vaughn (Napoleon Solo), David McCallum (Illya Kuryakin) & Leo G. Carrol (Alexander Weaverly), were perfectly selected for their roles.  Together they made an excellent & very enjoyable team.  They worked very well together & it showed,  They each had a perfect style for their character which was unique.  Under Sam Rolfe all the 1st season 29 episodes were written as serious SpyFi.  Plausible stories & villains.  And very COOL, intelligent & witty heroes.  The gadgets added a lot.  The special Man from UNCLE pistol that could be converted into a carbine (small rifle) as needed, the world-wide communicators, the ""door opening items"" & the very cool Del Floria ""secret"" UNCLE entrance (among others), & very neat filming tactics.  All these added to the UNCLE coolness.  But above all Vaughn & McCallum were what made this TV series a unique HIT.  Never has any other come close to the uniqueness & greatness of the 1st season of UNCLE.  Unfortunately Sam Rolfe left the series after the 1st season & it showed in the writing & production.  But the superb performances of Vaughn & McCallum & Carrol, kept the series going for a total of 3.5 seasons.  This is truly an exceptional timeless TV series.

However, now as when I was a child, I still believe the plots frequently lack continuity and depend on many assumptions by the viewer to fill in undeveloped plot which  are unclear at times and the action sequences are the worst I have ever seen in my extensive viewing history. LOL otherwise, it is a fun experience to watch these episodes as you refamiliarize with these characters and enjoy the mid-1960s again. Personally, I would not plan on buying any more of the series as this was to verify my less than perfect opinion which I had since childhood - I was right, unfortunately.

3304747,4,B0011VR6QI,"During the 60's there was an explosion of spy shows influenced by the popularity of James Bond and the Cold War. ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" was one of the best shows of the lot particularly during the first two seasons where it embraced the more serious one of the Bond films right down to the one liners. Ian Fleming contributed to the creation of ""U.N.C.L.E."" although he is not credited due to his contractual obligation to the Bond films. Sam Rolfe (who created ""Have Gun-Will Travel"")  was brought on board to develop the series and write the pilot as well as other episodes and as a supervising producer on the series. He left after the first season was completed. Originally titled ""Mr. Solo"" the series was unusual in that it also featured David McCallum as a Russian agent working with his American counterpart Napoleon Solo.

Most folks known the premise but I will give a very brief description of the series; Napoleon Solo  (Robert Vaughn) and Ilya Kuryakin (David McCullum)/ work for the United Network Command for Law Enforcement fighting an evil organization that threatens the balance of world power and peace called T.H.R.U.S.H.  This requires the two to travel the world protecting secrets regardless of national borders and preventing war between various nations. Their boss is Mr. Waverly (played by the marvelous, late Leo G. Carroll).

An interestingly bit of trivia--the first episode is named ""The Vulcan Affair"" and, later in the series, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy co-star in the ninth episode ""The Project Strigas Affair"". Seems like ""Star Trek"" was meant to be for them.

The first season was shot in black and white and the transfers here are pretty good although the series cold have used a bit of cleaning up (these were mastered back in 2006 or so) as there are various imperfections in the image but they are minor. There is a rather loud popping sound on the soundtrack during the credits that should have been corrected for the first episode of season one. Other than that, the set looks and sounds very good. I do wonder if there is a Blu-ray release pending. The show was shot in color but the final broadcast film masters were in black and white and that's what we get here. I'm oping that, at some point, Warner discovers the original MGM color masters but I doubt they exist at this stage.

The tone of the first season matches shows like ""Secret Agent Man"" (the retitled UK import ""Danger Man"") starring Patrick McGoohan although there is wry one liners and moments provided by Vaughn, McCallum and Carroll that nicely compliment the episodes. By the third season, the tone drifted into parody due to shows like ""Batman"" where camp was king. The series was limping badly quality wise at that time but still was doing fairly well in the ratings. By the time of the fourth season, the series made an attempt to return  the more serious tone of the first two seasons.

We don't get any extras in this stand alone release (although there were extras in the original boxed set) but Warner has wisely only put three episodes per disc which allows for maximum bit rate for the shows and the best quality

This is a nice release and the series stands up remarkably well 50 plus years later.

The stories were enjoyable, there was sufficient 007-like things going on and the ladies were well-cast. The later seasons started getting progressively more far-out and tongue-in-cheek but NBC went to full color soon afterward and shows like this would prosper.

Smart move, so audiences can (re)visit the classic TV show, before the big-screen version is released a few days later.

The trio from ""U.N.C.L.E.""
Author's collection
We can all go on those wonderful adventures all over the world populated by some of the oddest characters from any show. Spies, gadgets, gizmos and a host of guest stars teach how to blow up the world in under an hour, which all of the bad guys here seem intent on doing.

In this hit spoof of the omnipresent spy thrillers of the period (think Bond . . . James Bond), top secret agents Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin save the world weekly in 29 episodes. Remember hearing the fights and screams, and seeing the bruises and scratches, resulting from heated arguments between high-school ladies over the attractions of one spy (Solo, played by dapper Robert Vaughn) over the other (Kuryakin, played by boyish David McCallum). Some, prefering a guy more mature, simply choose Leo G. Carroll, who, as Alexander Waverly, kept the guys in a never ending battle against evil, chaos, crime and bad taste.

The guest stars can be pretty cool: Fritz Weaver, William Marshall, Carroll O'Connor, Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner in the same pre-""Star Trek"" show, and, of course, the ever lovely Roger Corman icon Tura Satana, all bosom and bravura, in the episode called ""The Finny Foot Affair.""

These suspenseful black-and-white mini masterpieces are a true gas. Add a little suspense and fun to your life and pick up this collection. You'll be crying for more ""U.N.C. L.E.""",1438214400,7,1706,4.872413793103449
3304767,5,B0011VR6QI,"Five stars for the first season only. One star for the other seasons. It was actually two different shows, the first season and the other three which were silly and poorly written. Think Adam West and batman for seasons 2 and 3. Sam Rolfe, the creator and producer left the show after the first season and for me the show ended. The first season was a drama with some ironic humor. It was not meant to be a spoof of James Bond, which for some strange reason, first year reviewers of them show labeled it. Watch the Vulcan Affair pilot's opening scene where there's an assault on uncle headquarters which ends with the iconic shattered glass scene, with Solo killing the intruder. I have no,idea how that was labeled a spoof. Get Smart was a spoof. Solo and Ilya were average sized men and used their wits more than muscle. The first year basically has smart scripts with wit and style. The music was by Jerry Goldsmith, Mortion Stevens , Walter Scharf, Lalo Schriffin. Think themes from Mission Impossible, and Hawaii five 0. Goldsmith theme from the first season was absolutely great. Unfortunately it was also redone with an inferior arrangement each additional season. Go figure. And the scores of the episodes became terrible organ music and bongos. It sounded just like the Addams Family and the Batman series.

Solo originally was a smart professional . Later seasons turned into greasy skirt chaser, instead of the sophisticated ,witty person of the first season. Uncle became a comedy after season 1. Drama can have humor but not comedy. Look at some of the quest stars in later seasons. Bill Dana, Sonny and Cher, Shelly Berman, Sherry Lewis, Harvey Lembeck, and others. Solo went from the drama of the Vulcan Affair to dancing the Watusi with a gorilla , man in a gorilla suit that is.

After all these years, the first season holds up well and some episodes are great , and the remaining seasons are as bad as I remember. I still remember how disappointed I was as a teenager to see what they are done to my all time favorite show.
If you loved Roger Moore as Bond instead of Connery or Craig you might like seasons 2,3,4. Otherwise save you money and watch the terrific first season only.",1438041600,3,2200,4.638461538461539

She really liked Man From Uncle and she would let me watch the show on her family's larger-sized TV (which if I recall was in a nice wooden cabinet, too.) I believe this and ""The Deadly Games Affair"" and ""The Green Opal Affair"" were three of the shows I saw at her house. The Deadly Games Affair scared me a little all those years ago, and it still bothers me even today. But that may be the only episode I don't like. I think I saw some episodes on my family's TV too but our TV set was of poor quality. It was better to ask Joan if I could watch on her TV.

This first season was down to Earth and had contributions from writer in residence Allan Caillou who was with British Intelligence during WWII behind the lines in Libya, Tunisia and Yugoslavia.  He also served in two law enforcement organizations.  Also impressive were some of the Directors including Richard Donner and Boris Segal.  There was humor, but it was subtle.

3304825,5,B0011VR6QI,"The first season is all black abd white but don't let that stop you.  This series is great, well, at least the first season is great.  Many episodes were directed by Richard Donner (the Omen, Superman, Lethal Weapon). One episode was directed by John Newland (One Step Beyond).  The legion of guest stars is astounding.  Willian Shatner and Leonard Nimoy together in an episode long before Star Trek.  Richard Kiel (Jaws).  Sharon Tate, Kurt Russel, the list just goes on and on.

Man from Uncle reminds me of the English series The Avengers.  Napoleon Solo is a bit like John Steed, an anachronistic representative of a earlier era, always well dressed, but a very professional spy.  Another parallel is how a big time spy agency sends just two agents into situations that would seem to benefit from much more man power.  And like The Avengers, Man from Uncle eventually self-destructed by getting too silly.  But that happens later.  Season one is very good.

It's a period piece now, showing life in the early sixties and this is part of the charm.  Because it was intended fot TV in the 60's, the violence is kept to a minimum. Don't expect the kind of violence that you see on today's show, it isn't there.  Man From Uncle, Season 1 is one of the best TV series from the early 60's offered by Amazon.  I highly recommend it.",1364169600,37,1329,4.591489361702128

3304827,4,B0011VR6QI,"At the time it was first broadcast the Man from U.N.C.L.E. was one of my favorite shows. I hadn't seen it since it went off the air except for the TV movie ""The Fifteen Years Later Affair."" I enjoyed the episode, but I will probably not be looking at any others. The series is almost 50 years old and the production values look it. Also, I have no interest in owning any of the episodes. I thought I was renting the episode and then looking at the screen more closely I realized that I had bought the episode. It was a nostalgic trip down memory lane and that's all.",1362441600,2,566,4.201834862385321

3304834,5,B0011VR6QI,I grew up loving Man from U.N.C.L.E. and saw it and downloaded and watched this show and a few others and it brought back so many fun and happy memories.  I love NCIS and Duckie is one of my favorite actors and watching him as a young actor in U.N.C.L.E. is just such a treat.  I think they should bring back the show and some of the same themes.  Thank you.,1350172800,,358,4.014084507042254

The quality is excellent and old memories were revived.

It brought back many wonderful memories of my childhood when as a family we all sat down together and watched this on TV. The four season episodes came in a nice 'secret agent suitcase' and the only thing that was missing was one of the U.N.C.L.E chicks sitting next to me.

3304837,5,B0011VR6QI,"I just received this as a Christmas present from my Wish List and was I ever surprised I received it as a gift primarily because of the cost associated with it. Well I can tell you that where I was severely disappointed in the Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E the Fifteen Year Latter Affair (see my review ""Cry U.N.C.L.E.), I love the Man from U.N.C.L.E. First Season. Even thou it is in B&W the First Season stuck to a serious action series without all the corniness that the subsequent seasons had that killed it as a series.

The major reason that the First Season is so good is that the Writer and Producer Sam Rolfe kept it on track. He left at the end of the First Season and the quality dropped in subsequent seasons.  Towards the  end the series tried to reverse the corny trend to serious action scripts, but it was too late. Old adage, if something works, let it be. Enjoy Season I and try to get it for $48 gift given me and not the $75 for a used copy or over $100 plus for a new copy out there.",1324857600,,1007,4.153846153846154
3304838,4,B0011VR6QI,"This is basically the second pilot.  The first episode was called Solo.  It was this episode shot in color with one change; Solo's was a Mr. Allison.  They remade the series when the actor Mr. Allison (Mr. Kullova I think) was replaced by Mr. Waverly.  The first pilot Solo was a shortened version of a film called To Trap a Spy.  In both the film and Solo the enemy UNCLE went up against was WASP and changed to THRUSH.  WASP was changed quickly for it sounded too close to White Anglo
Saxon Protestant.",1309737600,8,504,4.365591397849462

3304841,5,B0011VR6QI,"This is my one of my favorite seasons of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.
This is the black and white season when Sam Rolfe produced the show
(he left after season one). U.N.C.L.E. had subtle tounue in cheek humor
that put it light years ahead of other shows that followed in its wake.
The two hour ""Solo"" pilot, which is an elongated version of episode one,
""The Vulcan Affair"", makes me wish this had been America's first view of the show.
Instead, it was released as ""To Trap A Spy"" in movie theaters in 1966.
