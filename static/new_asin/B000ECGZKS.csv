8108317,5,B000ECGZKS,"I enjoyed this film, for one because I like Craig Ferguson and he is in it.  But even if he weren't I would have loved it, it is so moving. Anyone who has had been in therapy, will realize the practice wouldn't have been as widely used if people like this man Carl Jung hadn't lived and worked with people like this young woman.  It has its sad parts, but entertaining for those of us who like to think about life. Realize how experiences we have had and will have or see will affect our lives, we are the sum of all of our experiences in the end. Good..Bad or indifferent we are who we are because of these.",1145577600,10,608,4.100840336134453
8108318,5,B000ECGZKS,"This is the fascinating story of Sabina Spielrein told as a story within a story. Two modern day researchers hunt for the truth about history's first  female psychoanalist and her fate. In 1907,her Russian family commits her to a Swiss mental asylum for her eratic and delusional behavior. The early 20th century was still a barbaric place for the mentally ill. In an age before  drug therapy, they were at times cruelly restrained, repeatedly doused with ice water, recieved repeated electro-shock therapy and subjected to other various inhumane treatments in an effort to ""cure"" them. Sabina  willed herself to die partially as a punishment for her parent's abandoning her there. Carl Gustav Jung manages to penetrate her shell and literally saves her from herself. But can he save himself from Sabina? A young protege of Sigmund Freud, he was the first to try ""the talking cure"" with her and she is purportedly the first person he cured in this manner. In a brand new field, with few safe guards in place for either the patient or the doctor, the two become so entwined emotionally, that they fall hopelessly and helplessly in love. As Jung is pulled further and further under by Sabina's all engulfing love, he must beg her to save him by letting go. At his urging, the brilliant young Sabina attends and graduates from medical school then becomes a psychotherapist as well.  Ahead of her time in thought and action, she moves back to Lenin's Russia with her husband and young family to open ""The White Nursery.""  The first school based on  psychoanalysis and freedom of thought and  expression. It is from her letters to both Freud and Jung, that continued throughout her brief life, her diaries and the Soviet Archives that her story is taken. Though known from her letters, it was not until the fall of the Soviet Union that it was discovered what had become of her in World WarII. It has only been recently that it has been noted that she made significant and largely unrecognized, contributions  to both Freud's and Jung's work. Iain Glen is perfect as the conflicted and passionate Jung and Emilia Fox is mesmerizing as the insane to brilliant Sabina. This is a haunting tale that will stay with you long after the end credits roll. Well worth watching.",1142467200,9,2263,4.799485861182519
