8527154,4,B0007LFQ5Q,"JAPW has been around since (I believe) 1997 and has some big breakout stars, yet here is volume 1 of a ""best of"" collection that seems to be all from the last 5-7 years.  Don't get me wrong, they are good matches and definitely stuff people will be interested in seeing these days since it has some current TNA stars, but I would have liked to have seen a little more ""history"" with a best of collection.  For the price you can't beat it though, it's still a solid watch and great for fans of pro-wrestling and people sick of sports entertainment.",1220313600,4,547,4.352941176470588
