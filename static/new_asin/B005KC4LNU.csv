4716826,5,B005KC4LNU,"Watched it a few months ago. Just realized something. The title is probably a play on words. Both characters are in recovery from various forms of addiction, and at several points in the movie, one or the other must make yet another choice to stay sober, or not. In each situation, something or someone is a potential ""trigger"" for acting out on an addiction.

Tracy Wright died of cancer shortly after the movie came out, cancer diagnosed during or shortly before it was filmed. The plot seems to reflect this.

So it is a story about life at its most basic. The themes are handled marvelously, by two superb actors. I think about bits of the movie frequently.

Had to come back and put something here. (I don't write many reviews.)

DO NOT MISS IT.",1350777600,4,750,4.533333333333333
4716827,3,B005KC4LNU,"This is not a very good movie. It is also not a lesbian movie so it is mis-categorized. The entire movie revolves around two former band mates/friends who are meeting again for the first time in years. They catch up on their lives since they've been apart while both struggling to remain sober. Both women also appear to be straight until one kiss between Vic and another woman. That was the closest the movie got to ""Gay and Lesbian"", hence why I say it was mis-categorized.",1350518400,2,475,4.534883720930233
4716828,5,B005KC4LNU,A very good story of 2 women that had been rock stars.  They retire and life goes by a few years then they meet again.  One woman seems to have mental health issues from the drug life.  She has hallucinations and they talk to her.  But the 2 have time together and find again the spark between them that really sang once!  Worth seeing I thought.,1349049600,,346,4.181818181818182
4716829,3,B005KC4LNU,I expected this movie to be different. I kept watching it to see if I could at some point figure out what was going on. I expected the women to connect in some way other than arguing the entire time. I don't know. I guess I missed something.,1347667200,,241,4.041666666666667
4716830,5,B005KC4LNU,"I came across this film by accident, but it became one of my favorite films recently!
I watched it on Netflix, and I love it so much that I have to buy it :)

The dialogues are well written, the acting from both leads are awesome (those actress must be good friends in real life). However, this is not the type of film that you'll watch to kill time since it would make you think a lot. Better watch it with a clear, sensitive mind.",1339804800,,432,4.08235294117647
4716831,3,B005KC4LNU,"*some mild SPOILERS in review of this film*

A good movie between former lovers, to enemies, to STRICTLY friends.

I agree with the previous review completely. As a rock film this does severely lack, they do only sing ONE song... its a good song but thats it for ""rock"". I also found a few of the sitting and reflecting moments to be too long, some good blips to make you think, but mostly quite long winded. In addition to previous comments, I as well would like to have seen some love in the movie, rather than an often hostile then complacent rekindling of friendships. This movie did fall slightly short of expectation for those reasons.",1322956800,5,641,4.565217391304348
4716832,5,B005KC4LNU,"What happens when the music is over? Good question. And that is precisely the unofficial second title of ""Trigger,"" one of the best films that I have ever seen about music and musicians, one that will surely touch your heart.

Molly Parker stars as Kat, and Tracy Wright as Vic, in a story about two retired rock and roll musicians in Canada. The movie aptly begins with some exciting and inspiring black and white footage of the happy days, while performing to an enthusiastic crowd. We then move forward ten years later, when the two of them agreed to meet for dinner at a fancy restaurant, after not seeing each other for all that time. Even though it is a friendly meeting, we feel the tension of things past, emotions that they haven't been able to sort out. However, they decide to hang out after dinner to remember the good old times. It happens that Toronto is hosting a ""Women in Rock Tribute,"" and Kat and Vic were invited. While spending the night together in one activity after the other, they open up and let their feelings toward each other come out. By doing so, we learn about them and their life after being in the spotlight.

""Trigger"" is a small movie, full of emotion and great acting by both Parker and Wright. It will not only touch your heart due to the very engaging plot, but also because we learn that Tracy Wright died of cancer shortly after the film was completed. Hers was a great, final performance that we should treasure forever, and which should be awarded if there is justice in this world. The DVD features an actors' table reading and more. (Canada, 2010, color, 78 min plus additional materials). Reviewed on November 7, 2011, exclusively by Eric Gonzalez for Wolfe.",1320710400,17,1704,4.6019736842105265

4716834,4,B005KC4LNU,"Good chemistry among actors. Good story about a complex relationship, substance abuse recovery and its difficulties. I imagined this film as an on-stage performance too. I think its under- rated by previous viewers.",1389225600,,215,5.545454545454546
4716835,4,B005KC4LNU,Liked the inter play between friends. There were fun scenes as band members also. Is more about becoming more mature than about love.,1389052800,,133,4.826086956521739
4716836,1,B005KC4LNU,"This film does not belong in the gay/lesbian film selection. There is no evidence these women were ever lovers or might be. Do they love each other? No doubt. Are they both looking for some sort of fulfillment? No doubt. Is this a nightmare for people in recovery? Probably. It was a nightmare for me and I'm not.
Did I want it to end twenty minutes in? Yes! Do I resent people who throw film they can't define into the gay/lesbian section? Absolutely! Do I ever rate anything in Hate section? Hardly ever. But you'd have to pay me to watch it again, and I might hate you for it. My opinion. Perhaps I missed the bigger message.",1387929600,2,628,4.330508474576271
4716837,1,B005KC4LNU,This movie dragged on and on. I was expecting to see more than a sad dialogue but it never got better.,1383868800,,102,3.9047619047619047
4716838,2,B005KC4LNU,"This film was a very poor Banger Sisters wannabe. The acting was good, but the whiny, redundant dialog and depressing sets were grating. A good film should make one sad to leave it. I kept hoping this one would redeem itself, but no such luck. This script was an insult to the actors' talents and the viewer's intelligence.",1383091200,,323,4.586206896551724
4716839,1,B005KC4LNU,I found it painful to watch.  Story just did not interest me in any way.  Long winded conversations.  L-o-n-g winded.  Ugh.,1382140800,,123,4.714285714285714
4716840,2,B005KC4LNU,"The only good part is that they showed some of their past and you understood where they were coming from. Did not keep my interest. I agree with someone else who said they were hoping it was a lesbian love story. Not that it was the only reason to see it, but maybe it was a little like some rock movies that have been made in the last 10 years. Was I wrong, it was the two of them bitching about the past and trying to figure out if they were happy now. Do not bother renting this ..",1369785600,,484,3.898989898989899
4716841,3,B005KC4LNU,The audio was lilts so I ended up turning it up and down at odd moments. I ended up just reading a book while using it as background noise. The plot was cute; although it seemed there should be a part 2.,1364601600,,203,3.857142857142857
4716842,5,B005KC4LNU,"I watch an average of one movie per day on Amazon.  This film, Trigger, is among the overall best movies I've seen on here.  I know little about technical jargon, but the acting and general look of the film is as slick and well acted/directed as any, and better than most.  But what makes Trigger such a great movie, to me, is the subject matter.  This film is about 2 women (you could easily say ""2 people"" because the issues are not gender-specific) who are making their way through life's challenges, obstacles, and troubles 10 years after being in a popular rock band together... and in the middle of a rock and roll lifestyle complete with addiction and chaos.  The movie is about how the women are learning to live life without succumbing to the old vices that have previously wreaked havoc in their lives.  I definitely recommend watching it, and I'll be watching it again in the future.  Nice movie!",1361577600,,907,4.596273291925466

8476706,4,B005KC4LNU,"I read Paul McEwan's treatise ""Bruce McDonald's 'Hard Core Logo'"" Canadian Cinema treatise and learned an interesting fact about this film Trigger, which Bruce McDonald himself told McEwan:

Trigger was originally supposed to be the sequel to Hard Core Logo.  When Callum Keith Rennie and Hugh Dillon couldn't synchronize their availability with each other and Bruce due to their other acting commitments, it was re-written for two female leads.

HCL fans -- do not waste your time with Hard Core Logo II (ugh, what a sad waste of time). Watch Trigger instead.

You'll quickly realize Kat (Molly Parker) is a gender-swapped Billy Tallent and Vic (the late Tracy Wright) is gender-swapped Joe Dick.

Kat (Billy) is living the high life due to commercial success in LA, whereas Vic (Joe) is post-rehab, trying to maintain sobriety and make a comeback with a new acoustic album. They both get invited to a benefit concert (a *benefit concert*, HCL-fans!), so Kat/Billy invites Vic/Joe to dinner before hand.

On its own, let alone as the spiritual sequel to Hard Core Logo, this is a poignant examination of the tensions and often dysfunctional dynamics of two people's intense creative friendship and collaboration with each other more than a decade after their last work together, after they moved on from each other and their band -- one more successfully than the other. The tension ratchets up between them when they get together for dinner before the concert, and their old behavior patterns are triggered by each other.

Yeah, Trigger was the name of the band Vic and Kat led, but in this movie trigger is not just a proper noun, it's also a verb -- it's what they do to each other, whether they want to or not. The perhaps sad inevitability of that contrasts poignantly with all the positive aspects of their intense creative friendship. That is really what this movie is about

I would have liked this movie anyway. I really enjoyed more on multiple levels once I learned it was the intended Hard Core Logo sequel, but that was just icing on the cake for this fan of Hard Core Logo.

In some respects, their relationship is not just like a marriage, but it's also like the relationship of competitive siblings. So there are those petty, resentful, contemptuous moments, too.  The characters are kind of forced to reckon with the reality that together they are more than the sum of their parts, in both positive and negative ways -- whereas separately they may be safer and more stable, but are also maybe less creative and more risk-averse.

If you've seen HCL, then you know that Billy (Kat), Hard Core Logo's guitarist, was teetering on departing for LA and commercial success -- which would have spelled the end of his band Hard Core Logo, a desperate prospect for Joe (and John and Pipefitter), who had nothing else going on and wold be left back in Canada. And that is basically what has happened: Kat ""sold out"" and went to LA and on to commercial success, while Vic was left behind in Canada but has stuck to their old band's principles while also getting clean.

Now, don't get me wrong -- Trigger is NOT a rock 'n roll movie. It's more like an extended conversation about the good/bad old days by two aging (female) rockers, and the perhaps inevitable resurfacing of their old interpersonal dynamics.

Note: Trigger does NOT explore the aftermath of the tragic end of Hard Core Logo (well, now that they're both women and theoretically different characters, it doesn't have to). It does not neatly sew up loose ends.

I really liked this film.  It's probably the most mature film of Bruce McDonald's filmography.",1489276800,,3627,4.808681672025723

8476710,4,B005KC4LNU,"Introspective character drama. Ex-rockers Kat and Vic find themselves together again after a decade apart. Kat is visiting Edmonton, on a business trip she's arranged to coincide with a benefit concert, which itself is ""coincidentally"" taking place in the city where her old bandmate lives.

Both are reformed addicts -- Kat to alcohol, Vic to drugs. Much of the story relates to old patterns and how they resurface when these two reconnect. There is also of course the conflict between the direction the two lives have taken, Kat a high-powered creative in LA, Vic still pursuing her music, getting by.

The movie is very dialogue-driven. It all takes place in roughly 12 hours of time, and while the two main characters share activities, such as dinner, running into fans at the benefit, performing a song together, attending an ""after party"", etc. the story really is about the conversation that takes place during all of this. And be warned: while we can make some inferences, there's no tidy wrap-up at the end. Kat and Vic seem to have found their friendship again, but we are really just seeing a tiny moment in their lives, which go on as any would.

There are moments of ""alternate reality""/hallucinations, but I felt these were more a distraction than anything else, and probably could've been left out. The film didn't really pursue the idea very strongly, and so in the end these brief moments just seemed out of place.

Similarly out of place was the apparent concern of post-addiction health problems. Both characters mention their own worries along these lines, but they never really seem to be a core element of the plot or even their lives.

NOTE: Amazon has included ""gay/lesbian"" as a genre for the movie, but it's hard to see why. It's possible Kat and Vic were lovers in the past, and another woman does make a pass at Vic at one point. But these are not really what the movie was about, and the pair's past relationship is only very vaguely stated: we know they loved each other...but not necessarily as sexual partners, and even if they were, it's not clear that would have been a ""gay/lesbian"" thing so much as a ""sex, drugs, and rock & roll"" thing.

If your only reason for considering this movie is for some presumed gay/lesbian theme, you'll be sorely disappointed.",1407196800,,2292,4.775252525252525
