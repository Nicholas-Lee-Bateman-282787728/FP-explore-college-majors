8257834,5,B00158K1CI,"(This is a review of only the original ""Bedazzled"", released in 1967.)

Watched this on a whim once on late night PBS.  Hidden gem!  Has the surreal vibe characteristic of many mid to late-'60s films and TV shows (like Rosemary's Baby, The Munsters, My Favorite Martian, Bewitched, Dark Shadows, Addams Family, I Dream of Jeannie and Green Acres).

Satan (Peter Cook) repeatedly visits ordinary schmoe, Stanley (Dudley Moore) and treats him more like a mosquito would, not our notion of The Great Evil One.  This Devil pranks others by secretly breaking LPs in a record factory, messing up their phone calls, and other sophomoric tricks.  For Stanley he presents the Faustian bargain -- 7 wishes in exchange for his soul.  The outcome finds Stanley visited by human versions of the Seven Deadly Sins who tempt him, with comical results, including Stanley's being turned into a rock star and then a fly.

The dry, deadpan British humor has held up well for more than 50 years.

Back when I first watched it around 2001, I'd recorded it on VHS.  Glad I did: My then 7-year old (who was being educated in a Catholic school) loved it. He watched it over and over to the point that we quoted lines and gags from the film to each other for years  He especially enjoyed all the God jokes and gags and how the Devil was silly and funny and a prankster instead of scary and evil like a Voldemort.  The film is rather subversive that way.

To be sure, more conservative parents might not want their younger ones to watch this because it paints the Evil One as a silly pest instead of someone more traditionally nefarious.",1515110400,,1611,4.630281690140845
8257835,4,B00158K1CI,The original Bedazzled holds up well as witty as when I first saw it in London in the 1960's. Hard to beat the combination of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore as they are perfect as the devil and the dupe and of course Raquel Welsh as Lust...need I say more.,1410825600,2,253,4.08
8257836,3,B00158K1CI,"This is a review for the ""Bedazzled"" Double-take DVD set containing the 1967 and the 2000 version. I think for story and a little ""deeper"" meaning, the 1967 version is better than the 2000. In the opening, Dudley Moore is in church (imagine that) praying, well sort of and the Devil, he calls himself George, hears his thoughts, especially the part of ""giving anything"" to make his dreams come true. He is a cook who is deeply in love with a co-worker but never has the courage to ask her for a date. So George (Peter Cook) offers him a deal and with a ""JULIE ANDREWS!"" Dudley Moore goes from one bad wish to another. I never got the impression that Dudley Moore's character grew; he never outsmarted the devil. It turns out that God and Satan have a bet, to see who can get to 100,000 souls first. The film deals more with the sins and George's desire to get back into heaven. Which adds a depth that the 2000 version doesn't have. Also, despite her prominent image on the cover, Rachel Welch plays a very minor role as Lust.

The 2000 Bedazzled with Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley is campy and ""modern"". The two films have similar wishes, but they aren't exact. Elizabeth Hurley makes a delightful devil, though unlike Peter Cook's Satan, she doesn't have a staff made up of the Seven Deadly Sins. I think that Brendan Fraser does an admirable job of portraying many different character types. In the end, Eliot (Fraser) commits a selfless act and breaks the contract and all is right with the universe.

Both movies are entertaining and worth a view. I wouldn't go looking for any deeper meaning and just consider it all good fun. Well...fun anyway.",1297209600,,1657,4.575757575757576
8257837,4,B00158K1CI,"All of the reviews i have read so far ignore the fact that this double set is about AN ORIGINAL and ITS REMAKE.  I saw the original when it came out and it stuck to my mind as one of the most anti-clerical, no target-barred (including Hollywood) movies ever to come out of Britain.  Dudley Moore and Peter Cook are a perfect comedy team, and their chemistry is unbelievable.  Compare with Hollywood's version: a female bimbo in red as the Devil, and hapless Brendan Frazer, who happens to be a fine comedy actor, stuck in a movie totally devoid of ideological satire. I love both versions, the British as a thinking man's movie( 5 stars) and Hollywood's as mindless fast food fare (3 stars, and only for Brendan)",1254182400,,712,4.546875
