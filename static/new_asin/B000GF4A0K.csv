8131249,5,B000GF4A0K,"Made for just about a million dollars, KAMILLIONS plays out much like a low-budget hybrid of WEIRD SCIENCE mixed with Cronenberg body horror. The SFX aren't exactly top notch, but are charmingly crafted and ultimately add to the wacky, almost cartoonish tone of the film. KAMILLIONS was directed and co-written by Mike B. Anderson who in 1986 lensed the surreal, VHS-only slab of low-budget insanity called ALONE IN THE T-SHIRT ZONE and has also worked on THE SIMPSONS since about 1990 as a supervising animation director. Andersons talent behind the camera and the casts endearingly overacted roles help create what is ultimately an awesomely outlandish and colorful farcical comedy thatll keep you chuckling up until the I should have guessed! twist ending.

The original cut of KAMILLIONS is said to be about 120 minutes long, but the producers who were more familiar with Kung Fu movies decided to trim it down to just about 90 minutes, which is the cut youll be watching if you're able to track down the unauthorized VHS released in 1991 by a company called SBM out of Chatsworth, CA. In an interview with Joysticks and Party Hats, actor / co-writer Harry S. Robbins states that he still has the original 90 some odd reels tucked away in storage in hopes of one day releasing the full version of the film which includes completely cut scenes and more supporting characters. Sounds to me like someone needs to reach out to Harry and save him some storage money, man! Youre able to view a VHS rip of this rare flick on YouTube, but I highly VHSuggest that you scour the wild and steadfastly surf secondary online markets, because getting weird with the Wingates is an event best experienced through your very own VCR.",1487376000,,1720,4.8108108108108105
