8076718,5,B000AA4JPM,"This DVD is a comprehensive look back at the first 10 years of X-Games skateboarding. The main feature neatly and chronologically summarizes what went down at each event (vert, street, best trick, etc.) for each year (1995-2004). The top 10 finishers for each event are conveniently listed at the end of each segment. A well organized DVD, chapter advance brings you straight to the next event.

Bonus features include a brief slam montage, profiles of some of the skaters, additional footage of the Philly street competition, the many attempts leading to Tony Hawk's first 900, and all the 1st place runs for each event for each year in their entirety. Truly a video worth every penny. Can't wait for the next 10 years!",1130976000,3,720,4.853658536585366
