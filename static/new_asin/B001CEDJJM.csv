3511170,3,B001CEDJJM,I knew going in that it was going to have some beginner things. I've been playing for about 2 months. I didn't think that I'd have both discs down in a few hours. I'd recommend this for the complete or nearly complete beginner. I gave this to my g/f who's just starting to play.,1276128000,5,278,4.166666666666667
3511171,5,B001CEDJJM,"This is possible the best start anyone can get to playing clawhammer banjo, outside of a good teacher of this style of play. Thanks Dan.",1246406400,4,136,4.48

8287306,4,B001CEDJJM,husband loved it,1430697600,,16,4.666666666666667
8287307,5,B001CEDJJM,If you want to learn Dan's way of playing then this is a good place to start.,1425427200,,77,3.588235294117647
8287308,3,B001CEDJJM,"for the absolute beginner, the dvds are not very helpful unless you have the book which I have on order now.",1380326400,,108,4.190476190476191
8287309,4,B001CEDJJM,"Mr. Levinson does a good job presenting clawhammer basics for the beginner.  There is a good bit of basic music info, however, that is too elementary for musicians who play other instruments.  He answers many questions very well on holding the instrument and what to look for in an instrument that I wouldn't have known to ask.  Yes, I would definitely recommend this book.  4 stars instead of 5 stars only due to too much elementary music info.  I am making clawhammer progress mainly due to this book/video!",1361923200,,509,4.738636363636363
8287310,5,B001CEDJJM,Excellent for the beginner. I was playing a little after the 2nd day. I should have bought this before I purchased my banjo and other instructions.,1360540800,,147,4.6923076923076925
8287311,2,B001CEDJJM,"SInce this set of DVD's has the same title as the book, I kind of expected it to cover the same material.  Not even close.  He spends 2 DVD's teaching one song.  Kind of a rip-off considering the book which costs half as much teaches 12 songs and comes with 2 cd's.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was seeing someone play is valuable. The DVDs do a good job of showing left and right hand positioning.  The reason I bought a DVD instead of a book was I wanted to see the right hand position while playing.  Is it worth the money?  In my opinion.... No.",1360540800,,568,4.017857142857143
8287312,5,B001CEDJJM,this is a  nice CD.  very helpful &  useful in terminology would reccomend it to anyone who wants to learn,1357603200,,106,4.2
8287313,1,B001CEDJJM,"The information and base production seems good, but the post-production (conversion to DVD?) by MelBay is horrible.  The printed material is badly photocopied, so that parts are cut off, the DVD won't play in my computer, only a DVD player, and the sound track and video sometimes are out of synch.  I'll be returning this.",1345161600,,323,4.8545454545454545
8287314,5,B001CEDJJM,"id had the older vhs 2 tape set a while back, and when i decided again to play clawhammer banjo  dan levenson was my first choice.  im  happy this set is in dvd format, as it will be even easier to access the individual teaching portion...and lord knows an old-timer like me can use all the help he can get.  thanks.",1333497600,3,316,4.131147540983607
