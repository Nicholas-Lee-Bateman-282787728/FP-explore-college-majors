2821785,3,B000PHC9FM,"The last DVD in the first pack was badly warped so the shows were unwatchable.  It looks like the front label was stamped so hard it made an identical impression on the other side.

As for the Anime, I purchased season 1 from Borders before it went out of business and I enjoyed it so much I kept thinking about finding and purchasing the rest.  It is a light hearted break from reality and the tranlations well done.  I am still on the 3rd pack but have thoroughly enjoyed every episode except of course for the few mentioned above.

The later DVDs do have the VIZ copyright warnings at the beginning and end of the DVDs.  Though the outside box doesn't seem to show any company logo, the DVD packs do have a tiny fx logo on back.

As for the bootleg comments, the US has a division in the FBI that follows up on copyright infringement.  If you truly believe this is the case, then notify them.",1365465600,2,895,4.285714285714286
2821786,1,B000PHC9FM,"Don't buy this dvd, because this is not an original version. The only legal way to buy the Ranma 1/2 is buy the viz, the other foreign editions or buy the japanese version.

2821787,5,B000PHC9FM,This is awesome.  I was hoping to get a seasons worth when I bought it but it had the whole entire series so I was super duper mega-hyped about it.  The show is great and I am totally stoked about having bought the entire show.  I highly recommend it its great and very funny,1346889600,,275,4.055555555555555

2821789,5,B000PHC9FM,"If this is a review for Ranma 1/2, I could hardly do it justice. It's an anime series that has to be experienced rather than watched. Are you familiar with the works of Rumiko Takahashi? Well neither was I until I watched and loved her InuYasha story and followed it by Ranma 1/2. Ranma is a lot of visual comedy, adequate translation, great characters and great story. The voice actors who dubbed this in English did a great job considering the time was rushed to bring it to market, or so rumor had it. I could have started with a history and a lot of details but why would you want a review from me? Happy New Year and thanks for Amazon!! ^^",1293667200,,644,4.2439024390243905

2821791,3,B000PHC9FM,"All I am going to say is that the bootleg company pictured here is one of the best. Fx always makes some good rips with decent packaging. Really though, it can't be too hard to get the whole set legitimately for just a little more money. ...Nevermind, it would cost you about $210 for the complete DVD set if you bought them by season box sets.",1290384000,2,344,4.2272727272727275
2821792,1,B000PHC9FM,"Bootleg item. Doesn't benefit the creators of the anime, and the official N.A. distributors (yea, the people who bring anime from Japan into U.S. Legally).

The quality will Not be DVD-worthy as these will be ripped off of Viz English-dubbed VHS videos. Save your money and buy something else!",1187222400,9,293,4.979591836734694

8191362,4,B000PHC9FM,"I'm a huge fan of Ranma 1/2!  I know there aren't that many of us around anymore, but if Ranma appeals to you, the entire series should be your ultimate desire.  My only complaint is that the series is a little too episodic.  Although there are a lot of great characters, and they're introduced very well, they usually end up just being running gags after their introduction.  This means that season 1 is absolutely golden, but things become total garbage by season 7.
Just in case anyone's actually looking at this without knowing what Ranma is, it's a romantic comedy with action elements.  Ranma Saotome and his father are martial artists who go off training in some cursed springs in China.  Unknown to them, each spring has a curse that changes your form to whatever drowned in that spring.  Now whenever they are drenched in cold water, Ranma becomes a girl (hence the name: 1/2 male, 1/2 female) and his father becomes a panda.  Hot water returns them to normal.  Ranma's father has another martial artist friend with 3 girls of his own, and the two agree to betroth their children to each other.  From that point, this becomes a harem anime, but with a web of relationships significantly more complex than what usually comes from that genre.  For example, Ranma's engaged to Akane Tendo.  Akane is very popular with the boys at school, and one such boy (Kuno) sees Ranma as a huge rival.  Kuno is unaware of Ranma's curse, and when he sees Ranma's female form, he is instantly enamored.  Kuno's sister, Kodachi, takes exactly the opposite approach.  Throughout the series, Ranma has to answer for the various crimes that his father committed when Ranma was a small child.  These incidents also introduce us to some other ""fiancees"" of Ranma, so they all end up competing for him.
The voice acting of this series is a little bit questionable until you look at the subtitles.  Usually anytime there's a bad line, it's just because they're actually honoring what the original series had.  This is also the only anime I've ever seen that managed to write translations for the op/ed themes in a way that actually work as legitimate English lyrics.  In general, I found the English dub to be very well-done.  My only real complaint is the change in voice actors for Ranma halfway through.
Of course, a good amount of interest in this series is particularly in the special nature of Ranma.  As a bigendered character, he is of special interest for anyone interested in transgender or bisexual characters.  Although Ranma identifies as a straight male (and there are unfortunately a few instances where anything else is deemed repulsive), he does live both sides constantly and has suitors of both genders.  There are some subtle hints that Akane may not necessarily be straight, either.  The two have a very tsundere relationship, openly rejecting each other but afraid to lose each other, as well.  Akane hates boys, at first shown because she has to fight a bunch of them every day (it makes some sense in context).  There are also some times when she actually says she likes Ranma as he is.  However, nothing is actually explicit about Akane being attracted in female Ranma, so it creates an interesting little mystery.
I ultimately do concede there are better animes out there, but this one holds a seriously unique place.  I'd say it easily trumps Inuyasha, made by the same artist.  If you've checked out season 1 and enjoyed it, I highly recommend this full set.",1456790400,2,3470,4.765494137353434
8191363,4,B000PHC9FM,I could not watch an episode not sure because of the scratch on the CD or  something was wrong with that just one episode. Besides that it is good.,1443139200,,147,4.068965517241379

8191366,1,B000PHC9FM,"Don't get me wrong, I love the series, but when the layout on the disks started getting odd and episodes doubled or were in the wrong order, I grew suspicious.  My husband got these for me thinking they were the real deal, but with a bit of digging I found out they are bootleg copies and not great ones either.

They almost look authentic, honestly, but later disks in the series have a lot of weirdness (such as that mentioned above in addition to oddly or misnumbered menus, hidden double menus on one disk, etc.).

I should have guessed it when I first noted it wasn't produced by Viz Video.  I just thought they must have sold it or something.",1410998400,,648,4.375
8191367,1,B000PHC9FM,"I had a disk from the set that was unplayable. The seller was going to replace it, then I got to wondering (after I found out this is a pirated collection), I have to go through all of the DVDs to see if there are any more might be damaged? My time and money have been wasted enough already!!!

If I'm going to spend almost $200 bucks it must be the real deal otherwise I can just go to some seedy torrent site or a flea market!

The seller was accommodating after I contacted  Amazon. I got my money back.

 FYI TO MEDIA KING, FBI states copyright infringement is a $250,000 fine plus possible jail time.

Amazon people, why do you allow pirated works to be sold on this site!",1399766400,6,677,4.1692307692307695

8191369,5,B000PHC9FM,well I don't have much to say about this series other than its a pulled together copy but its still a great copy. this is long old series so the acting fixes itself as the storyline goes on.,1373760000,4,190,4.026315789473684
8191370,4,B000PHC9FM,"Ranma 1/2 is Anime romantic comedy, an early work of the same person who would later create InuYasha. Meet Ranma Saotome, of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts (and they mean *anything* goes.... his first tournament style challenge is martial arts rhythmic gymnastics.... it gets much more absurd from there). In training, he and his father fall in cursed pools. As such in cold water, they change into whoever (or whatever) fell into that pool and drowned. Ranma changes into a young girl, and his father into a panda. Many of the other characters in the series have similar transformations.

Meet Akane Tendo, betrothed to Ranma from birth by agreement between their fathers (who have been close friends for years). As an arranged marriage, they are both resistant but share chemistry and grow closer over the course of the series, never willing to admit this of course.

Downsides (why not five stars? because): It is a long series. and does drag on a bit. Also the disc layout isn't ideal. The set is designed around the fewest discs, meaning if you want to sit down and just watch one disc you are still in for a marathon. Still, great series, definitely recommended.",1368316800,3,1178,4.798029556650246
