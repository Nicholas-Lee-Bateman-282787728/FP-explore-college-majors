884524,5,6304436998,Charlton Heston plays a tough but sensitive Major who befriends a boy without a father. It is still one of my favorite movies and would enjoy seeing it on DVD. I believe not only the old but the young would see this as A Great movie. The compassion shown could enlighten all.,1226188800,3,275,4.3076923076923075
884525,5,6304436998,"Major Barney Benson (Charlton Heston) is considered too tough on his men and has said some embarrassing things about the army in a magazine article.  The top brass decide to put him on inactive status to cool off so he becomes the new commandant of a boys' military school.  But the Major is too hard of his young charges, too, until he sees the light thanks to the pretty school doctor (Julie Adams) and a tiny cadet (Tim Hovey).

Heston's considerable charm and comedic talents make this a sweet, feel-good family film.  He booms out the orders to men and boys alike, but, of course, has a heart of gold.  Adams isn't quite on Heston's acting level, but Tim Hovey steals all his scenes as the smallest boy at school.  He was absolutely adorable and I loved his performance.

The movie is firmly rooted in the fifties and can sometimes get corny, but it's still worth watching thanks to the wonderful Charlton Heston.  He's ably supported by many good actors including a young Sal Mineo and Milburn Stone (""Doc"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunsmoke/dp/B000PHX5KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunsmoke</a>).  This is a wholesome movie all ages can enjoy.",1222992000,6,1204,5.229166666666667
884526,5,6304436998,"One of the brightest comedies of the 1950's,""The Private War of Major Benson"", features brilliant performances by Charlton Heston, Julie Adams, and ""scene stealer"", SAL MINEO, in one of his first featured roles. Heston is ""Major ""Bernard Benson. A tough battle-scarred officer whose inappropriate comments to a magazine almost get him kicked out of the service. Instead, as a last resort, he is transferred to the Sheridan Military Academy for boys, aged 6-16. Demanding and unsympathetic is how he seems towards the boys, and they retaliate towards Benson. And the school nurse, Kay (Adams), is concerned that Major Benson's unorthodox methods have much to be desired. Many HILARIOUS moments fill this uproariously funny film. Eventually, nurse Kay falls for the stoic, yet big-hearted Benson. A young SAL MINEO steals the film, as Cadet Colonel Sylvester Dusik. He gains much respect for Major Benson, and has some truly comedic moments. Especially in the scene where Sylvester tells the training troups, in a frenzy, ""Does everybody in this school have two left feet? Alright you guys, you're gonna keep on drilling till you do it right!"" The delivery of these lines, shows Sal also had a terrific flair for comedy, and shows why he was such a meteoric rising young star! Also notable, is 6 year old actor, Tim Hovey, adorable in the role as Tiger, one of the youngest cadets at the academy. Directed by Jerry Hopper,""The Private War of Major Benson"" is a true comedy classic.",1079395200,21,1479,5.016260162601626
884527,5,6304436998,"Charlton Heston is generally thought of as the hero of epic-style films. But in this family-style comedy, filmed after The Ten Commandents and before Ben-Hur, he proves he has comedy chops. As a hard-driving Army major, he is ""punished"" by being sent to work at a boy's milatary school. Perhaps unique to the times, the love interest of this film is not, as Major Benson first supposes, a nurse . . . but a full-fledged doctor, beautifully played by Julie Adams. A trove of child actors from that period, plus wonderful William Demarest and quite a few other recognizable familiar faces (including a very young David Jansen, in the first few minutes) round out the cast. A good script and delightful theme song (used also for another Tim Hovey movie, Toy Tiger) make this a very enjoyable experience.",1029024000,17,800,4.804347826086956

884551,4,6304436998,Fun film. It takes the man who played Moses and Ben Hur into new territory of light comedy. The child actor playing Tiger is very cute and lovable. The lovely Julia Adams plays Hestons love interest beautifully.,1483833600,,211,4.72972972972973

884624,5,6304436998,My high school experience included ROTC and the same kind of guidance and supervision that was exemplified in this film.  I enjoyed it and wish I had seen it many years earlier.  It gives the viewer an insight into the relationship between the Army personnel and the administration of the school.  All of this was realistic.  You couldn't have written a better script to demonstrate how the cadet Colonel learned the concepts and methods of leadership because of the difficult situation that Charleton Heston's character put himself in.  I can also understand that those who did not have an ROTC experience would not fully appreciate this film.,1393459200,,644,4.981308411214953

884626,5,6304436998,"Charlton Heston took a gamble making this movie and for a good reason.  Instead of taking a pay check, he took a slip of the profits and he was one of the first big name stars to do this.  Tim Hovey was only in a few movies and that is too bad, the interaction between Hovey and Heston is priceless!",1379548800,,299,3.966666666666667

884648,3,6304436998,I give this 3 stars because I'm under 50 years of age and foolishly thought it might live up to its Wayan brother remake. As a die hard Major Benson Winifred Payne fan I thought this movie was worth a lone watch just to complete my degree in all things Major Payne. Not worth paying money for if you're on the fence.

884650,5,6304436998,"In my opinion, this is a much under-appreciated little gem (along with ""Toy Tiger"", starring Tim Hovey and Jeff Chandler).  Tim Hovey is a fun child actor.  Charlton Heston excels comedically here, and so does Julie Adams(""Creature From The Black Lagoon""). Amazing that both these Tim Hovey movies are unavailable on commercial DVD.
