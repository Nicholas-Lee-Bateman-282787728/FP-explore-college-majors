7952523,4,B00005RIZ9,"This 2 movie set includes the first two ""U.S Seals"" movies. Both of these movies are defiantly B-Movies. Neither of these movies make much since and they take themselves a little 2 seriously, but I enjoyed both of them (you will to if you enjoy b-movies)

Note - both of these movies are in ""full screen""",1439683200,,304,4.428571428571429
7952524,2,B00005RIZ9,"This movie is overdosing on action. A guy gets kicked in the face and does a triple-whirl in the air before falling to the ground. The plot makes James Bond look intelligent and the action scenes are completely chaotic. I suppose the film's one saving grace is that it's much better than the first. A group of U.S. Seals (not Navy SEALS) is sent to an island to stop a megalomaniac from firing a missile. There is tons of violence that never stops to take a breath of air. The fight scenes, though well done, are completely ludicrous and highly unbelievable. It steps down into kung-fu territory, but still wants the viewer to believe it's an intelligent, Clancy-like thriller. It's not.",1039478400,,687,4.68595041322314
7952525,1,B00005RIZ9,"Horrible, horrible.  Unrealistic plot, and the sounds overdubbed are absurd.  A guy salutes and there is a sound of a sword whizzing by your head.  A guy pulls a gun, and there is a sound of a sword whizzing by your head, etc., etc. Don't see this if you expect a well made action movie. This might appeal to someone under 13, but you'd have to sucker your parent or guardian to take you to see it.  Spare them the pain.",1010188800,3,420,4.148148148148148
7952526,3,B00005RIZ9,"I read all of the reviews before and most of you made some really good points.  while I agree with the one person who hated the movie, just remember this is a low-budget-chop socky-military slightly based action movie.  it is fun, a joke and best of all a total popcorn movie.  everyone!?----sit back put your brain on hold and enjoy.  I have seen some really wretched movies but at least this was fun.",1009929600,3,402,4.465753424657534
7952527,1,B00005RIZ9,"(...) why this movie was made i don't know, but the man who was responsible for it should be considered a criminal. i only rented it because there were two rowes of it gone and only one left, only god knows why. and it was the worst 40 minutes ever, i couldn't make ot through any more than that. bottom line, don't see it.",1008028800,,323,4.0625
