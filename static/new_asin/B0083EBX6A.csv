8524496,5,B0083EBX6A,Let me start off by saying I have tried numerous workout dvd's over the years and none of them have given me the results that I've gotten from doing Jillian Michael's workouts. I'm not a beginner I would say im more on the intermediate level. This dvd is intense! I took several breaks the first time I did it and I was dripping sweat like crazy! I started with Jillian 3 months ago and I've lost a total of 16 lbs so far (started at 160 currently 144). She is a great motivator and I always look forward to working out everyday.,1391040000,2,529,4.196078431372549
