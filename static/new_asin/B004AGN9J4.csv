8420227,5,B004AGN9J4,"Bound For Glory 2010 was the first Bound For Glory during The Hogan Era. I thought this was a great show. The first year of The Hogan Era was pretty good I thought then things went downhill afterwards. As a TNA Fan and a Wrestling fan TNA couldn't offer you a much  show. They had a great world title match. They had Sting and Nash tagging in a great supporting match. They had the element of hardcore bringing ECW wrestlers to fight Fortune a Four Horsemen knock off full of TNA Original Legends. RVD vs Abyss in a revenge match which was a money match. There was a great womens match that saw Tara one of my favorite womens knockouts take home the strap.

  The main event was awesome. It was a great match and though turning Hardy heel was a mistake I give TNA the credit for having the guts to do it. It really didn't workout for them. I think Immortal was a good idea but didn't pay off. It was a great way to end the show as we got a shocking end. Eric and Hogan returning to the heel roles seemed like a bad idea to me as we have seen that before. Eric does the heel best. I think The Hulkster should have stayed good. The idea of Jeff Jarrett and Hogan and Eric on the same team was hard to buy but I think they reconciled and got over Bash at The Beach. I know Eric has never spoke too kindly of Jeff and Hogan refused to lose to Jeff. It was interesting though and gave pro wrestling a spark for awhile.

  Sting and Nash against Joe and Jarrett was a good match. Sting made TNA a household name and his presence on the card helped greatly. I was glad to see Nash wrestling as he gets buried in WWE for going to WCW. I love watching Nash wrestle and he only got that chance in TNA so it was great to see him on the card too. Nash was one of the greatest wrestlers of all time and most influential. Maybe he played a big role in WCW's downfall but in TNA he helped them get bigger. Joe always delivers a great match and he should be main eventing and it is good he was in an important high profile match like this. Jarrett was never my favorite wrestler but he really proved to be a great wrestler with his matches with Kurt Angle. He made TNA so I was always respect him for that and he carried the company until he was pushed to the side. I think Jarrett became a better wrestler as he got older.

  Lockdown with Dreamer, Raven, Rhino, Sabu and Richards vs Fortune was an awesome brawl. We had Ric Flair and Foley brawling outside too, I thought Flair was great for TNA. He made me want to watch. He really shouldn't be wrestling at that time but I loved watching him wrestle. He was a great mouthpiece and he was a great manager but obviously overshadowed the people he managed. I loved seeing those ECW wrestlers in TNA. Raven was always a great wrestler who helped put TNA on the map. Sabu is a legend in wrestling and having him on the card only makes it better. Rhino was a great wrestler who never got to do much in TNA he seemed to be on the sidelines as he could be a world champion for a longer time than he was in 2005. Tommy Dreamer is the definition of hardcore. Awesome match.

  Overall this was a great moment for TNA although it might be the start of downfall I think it was a great moment for the company. Dixie tried to compete with WWE she brought in all the names she could and tried. It was an exciting and interesting time that I loved. In 2012 I stopped watching TNA as it was just so bad and the next year they were almost out of business from the damage Hogan and Eric had done likely. I am glad TNA was able to regroup, rebuild and stay in business. 2010 was a great year for wrestling as TNA made a run at competing with WWE but it didn't work. But I think this was a great show that TNA fans and Wrestling fans can look back on and be happy because they tried to make wrestling better. Cheers and enjoy the show!",1428796800,,3852,4.092838196286472

8420230,4,B004AGN9J4,"I bought this ppv the night it came out. It was a surprising ppv for many reasons.

1. Motor city machine guns vs generation me
Very good way to start the ppv. TNA showcased how a great tag team match is made with this match.
5/5

2. Knockouts 4 way match
Nothing truly special about this match
1.5/5

3.  Orlando Jordan and Eric Young vs Ink Inc
Comedy match. Eric had me laughing the whole match.
2/5

4. Jay lethal vs Douglas Williams
This was more of a technical match than an X division match, but still a decent match
2.75/5

5. Rob Van Dam vs Abyss
T monsters ball compare did Mitt others",1349654400,,595,4.175438596491228
8420231,3,B004AGN9J4,"I just watched Bound for Glory 2010 and honestly it was actually a pretty good show.

*Motor City Machine Guns vs. Generation Me (TNA Tag Team Championship)
This was a fantastic match to start with. Out of all of their PPV matches I have seen this one although a few minutes shorter than their other battles, this match is easily the best. There was so much high-impact and high-flying action going on it will make your hair stand up. Great start!

*Tara vs. Madison Rayne vs. Angelina Love vs. Velvet Sky - TNA Knockouts Championship Fatal 4 Way Match
Nothing special.

*Ink Inc. vs. Eric Young/Orlando Jordan
A randomly placed tag team match that really has no place on the show. Plus Young attacks his partner and then hugs him after the match is over. Confusing, and could be skipped.

*Jay Lethal vs. Douglas Williams (X-Division Championship)
Not a bad match, but once again nothing special.

*RVD vs. Abyss - Monster's Ball Match
People seem to criticize this match a lot because it wasn't as bloody as previous monsters ball matches. Although I'll agree this wasn't a bloodbath this was a very good monster's ball match in my opinion. Tables, barbed wire, just pure awesomeness from start to finish. Very under-rated match, watch it and check it out for yourself.

*Sting/Kevin Nash/D'Angelo Dinero vs. Jeff Jarrett/Samoa Joe - 3 on 2 Handicap Match
There's all this talk about conspiracies that keep you very interested in this match, nothing too special but nothing bad either, worth watching to give you another piece of the big puzzle of these ""conspiracies"" and who ""They"" are.

*EV2 vs. Fortune - Ten Man Lethal Lockdown Match
Lethal Lockdown still hasn't lost any steam. It's Lethal Lockdown the way you've always seen it, brutal violence, lots of action, weapons being used, blood everywhere, stuff happening of top of the cage. It's Lethal Lockdown at it's finest. Great match! ECW! ECW! ECW!

*Jeff Hardy vs. Kurt Angle vs. Mr. Anderson - TNA Championship Triple Threat Match
A great match to end this big show. A TNA main-event as it should be, it should be one of the best matches on the card, if not THE best. I'll still say the Tag Title Match was the best but this match is still very good and entertaining. Plus, we get to find out who ""They"" are. (Also available on: ""Immortal Forever"" and ""Enigma: Best of Jeff Hardy Vol. 2""

As far as extras go it's the same as always. The 28 minute before the bell special, cheap music video, a 4 minute highlight video of fan interaction (which I was dissapointed in), and 5 minutes worth of post match interviews, which for a TNA dvd is not a lot. All this could easily fit on one disc, the fact that it's a 2 dvd set is irrelevant.

All in all not a bad show, not the best, but certainly worth watching.",1326931200,,2768,4.607723577235772
8420232,4,B004AGN9J4,"I'm a fan of TNA (and wrestling in general) and I like to be entertained.  It's like in every movie when I realize: IT'S A MOVIE!  Same with wrestling; storylines may not always make sense, wrestlers may make mistakes now and then, but at the end of the day, I want to be entertained.
Having said that, I really enjoyed the Bound for Glory event.  From the opening tag match (that should have been the Feud of the Year because they had so many Match of the Year candidates) to the Monster's Ball to the Lethal Lockdown (great brawl) to the Main Event (and the ultimate revelation of ""They"", BTW a very good match to boot) I found myself in awe (Gen Me-MCMG, Lethal Lockdown), laughing (at Eric Young), puzzled (Knockouts) and upset (Joe and Jarrett-Sting,Nash and Pope). Of course, at the end I realized that this was a wrestling event and not Biological Anthropology; I felt like I was entertained, which is all I ask for.
Now, can someone please explain to me what the hell Taz is talking about when he says ""Let the pigeons loose?!""",1295395200,,1035,4.49468085106383
8420233,3,B004AGN9J4,"The World Tag Team title match between The Motor City Machineguns & Generation Me was a fantastic,high-flying showstealer. The 4 way Knockouts title match while not a bad bout,Tara's win was nothing more then a fluke. The Ink Inc-Eric Young/Orlando Jordan match was stupid & disappointing thus making it a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"". The X-Division title match between Doug Williams & Jay Lethal had nice X-Division action with a nice touch finish to boot. The Monster's Ball match between RVD & Abyss succeeded in providing a solid brawl without taking away from the rest of the card but less eventful then I thought. The 3-on-2 hanicap match was a pretty good bout until screwy finish to ruin it. The Lethal Lockdown match between EV 2.0 & Fortune received proper closure. Everyone in that bout tried their hardest to make this blowoff stand out and even guys like Sabu & Raven looked in thier roles. The 3 way bout for the World title while having few rough spots,it still had good wrestling but the overbooking killed the contest. Overall,It has some quality wrestling but a letdown in terms of story. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1289001600,2,1139,4.728643216080402
8420234,3,B004AGN9J4,"TNA Tag Team Champions Motor City Machine Guns vs. Generation Me - After the actions by Gen Me after the match at the last PPV, the Guns were out for revenge here & had the control early.  Gen Me were able to get the momentum back in their favor by doing a hanging DDT off the ringpost on Shelley's previously injured neck which was the target with a double team neck & backbreaker combo along with various kicks to the back of his neck.  Sabin was able to get the hot tag & at one point pulled off a unique double team move with Shelley that Taz & Tenay didn't know how to call.  The action was fast paced & non-stop with Shelley doing a ""crash & burn"" slingshot dive onto the outside, Jermey doing a 450 splash on Sabin while Maxx had his elevated off the ground, and Sabin doing a release german suplex from the top rope.  Taz described this match best as it was an ""air show"" & definately the best way to the begin the show as these two teams always deliever.

Knockouts Champion Angelina Love vs. Velvet Sky vs. Madison Rayne vs. Tara - Former WWE diva Mickie James was the special referee here in this fatal four way where the first person to score the victory gets the title.  Eventhough it was made clear that this was a ""every woman"" for herself match, both sets of partners came to the ring with each other while Madison made it clear in the pre-match interview that Tara's only job was to make sure that Madison walked out as champion.  To further imply the ""every woman for herself"" mindset, both Beautiful People members went against each other early in the match.  This match had it's moments with everyone getting a shot in here & there with Velvet doing an octopus submission that we hadn't see from her before.  The big story here was that Tara accidently won the Knockouts Title before realising what he did causing Madison to get in her face about it & disrespecting Mickie in the process causing her to have the last word on Madison.

Ink Inc. vs. Eric Young & Orlando Jordan - Since his last PPV appearence as part of ""The Band"" back in May, Eric Young is back to his comedic ways & that's all this match was...comedy.  From his markered tattoos, coming out with ""The Rule Book"", making sure that his own partner didn't cheat, and even got in the Ink Inc. corner to tag Shannon Moore & beat up his own parnter in Jordan...this just made Tenay ask the obivious question afterwards, ""What the hell did we just watch?""  If your a fan of Eric Young's comedy then you'll enjoy this as I tried to but not even I could hold back some laughs at how goofy this was.

X Division Champion Jay Lethal vs. Douglas Williams - This was one of those X division matches that wasn't very ""spotty"" & more mat based however they just never seemed to get out of the box here as Williams dominated most of the match with is ""technical"" offense including a heavy amount of suplexes while slowing down the momentum whenever Lethal began to build it but this all came down to Williams going outside of his usual routine to do a top rope move only for that to be the one mistake Lethal needed to capitalise to win.  The match was average & the aftermath didn't help any.

Monster's Ball: Rob Van Dam vs. Abyss - Based off what happened days earlier on Impact between Dixie Carter & Abyss, this was set to be Abyss' last match as he was scheduled to be fired from the company at midnight.  This match had it's moments like Abyss on the recieving end of a bulldog into barbed wire boards before moving out of the way of RVD's rolling thunder causing him to land back first into the tacks, another attempted at rolling thunder but this time going over the top onto Abyss through a table, both the Van Daminator & Van Terminator, RVD being hit with a chair on the top rope & falling through another barbed wire board, and RVD getting his revenge with ""Janice"".  Overall this would have been good for a ""No Disqualification"" match but very ""PG"" for a ""Monster's Ball"" this was very tame as there wasn't any blood or real ""Holy Crap!"" moments.

Jeff Jarrett & Samoa Joe vs. Sting, Kevin Nash, D'Angelo Dinero - The challenge was originally issued for this to be a six man tag with Joe & Jarrett teaming with Hulk Hogan but with Hogan out of action due to his back surgery, this was a handicap match but little did anyone know just how much of a handicap this was going to be.  Joe started off & stayed in the ring fighting the other team while Sting kept focusing on getting his hands on Jarrett whenever he had the chance to but after taking on all 3 men took it's toll on Joe, he went to tag Jarrett...who then just dropped to the floor & walked away causing Nash, Sting, and Pope telling Joe ""We Told You So!"" before Joe just said ""screw everyone"" & went out fighting but the odds were just too much.  This was one of those matches which the purpose was to put over a storyline more than anything which is this case was the entire ""smoke & mirrors"" concept that Sting has been talking about for months.

Lethal Lockdown: EV2 vs. Fortune: Tommy Dreamer, Sabu, Stevie Richards, Raven, Rhino vs. A.J. Styles, Beer Money, Kazarian, Matt Morgan - For those who haven't seen a Lethal Lockdown match, it's held under the same rules which the old WCW/NWA match of War Games where under. One man from each team starts the match and after a period of time, another member from one team (which has always been the heel team for those trivia buffs) enters and after each time period, the teams alternate sending members in. Once all team members enter the cage, the roof containing all the weapons is lowered onto the cage and the only way to win is by pinfall or submission. Just like the previous Lethal Lockdown matches in TNA, this was a very entertaining multiman brawl with various highlights such as Flair & Foley picking up where they left off on the previous Impact, Stevie Richards injuring his ankle early yet continuning to fight, Tommy Dreamer taking a page out of Great Muta's playbook, the Tower Of Doom, Morgan & Raven getting into a duel with weapons that neither guy sold to the point where it looked like it turned into a shootfight, Kaz thrown through the cage door, and the suprise at the top of the cage.  What the earlier Monster's Ball lacked, this match had & more...great hardcore brawl.

TNA World Championship Match: Kurt Angle vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Mr. Anderson - This was one of those triple threat matches that was non-stop action with each men having their moments to look strong with such moments like both Angle & Hardy going after Anderson early, Kurt Angle german suplexing both men at the same time while later applying an single anklelock to both men, Angle injuring his ribs via a samoan roll from Anderson off the top rope followed by a Hardy swanton bomb on both men, and Angle delivering a top rope Angle Slam.  The big story here was the appearence of Eric Bischoff with a chair looking to hit someone with it before Hulk Hogan made his first appearence in weeks coming down the ramp & getting in the ring on crutches looking ready to fight Bischoff who took one of the crutches before Hardy intervented & took the crutch from Hogan...to nail Kurt Angle with it & hit Anderson with the other one causing Hardy to pin Anderson.  From there, Jeff Jarrett & Abyss came down to the ring to celebrate with Hogan & Bischoff & Hardy when RVD made his way down only for Hardy to nail him with the championship.  Abyss' words rang true as ""THEY"" arrived on 10-10-10.

In the end, this card had a mixed bag of everything from matches that where just there (X Division), good for what it was (Eric Young's comedy), disappointing (Monster's Ball) while others were just average (Knockouts) or was more about the story than the match (handicap tag) but there was enough positives on here to stand out (Tag Titles, Lethal Lockdown, World Title Match) & there really wasn't a bad match on here so this was an enjoyable show overall so it's something I would recommend for a viewing.",1288915200,3,7987,4.441558441558442
