7283214,5,B00ZK6IRZY,Had to share with my best friend who is very spiritual as I. The colors and art was impressive and the point of view that Jesus is the lamb of sacrifice . I being a strict vegan gave me clarity about eating as in paradise and because Adam and Eve disobeyed caused the first sacrifice of animals and continued until Jesus came to be the sacrifice for all.,1462060800,,354,4.220588235294118
7283215,3,B00ZK6IRZY,Not exactly what I thought it would be. Was not expecting animation,1458000000,2,67,4.666666666666667
7283216,4,B00ZK6IRZY,"Excellent animation and live pics incorporated in an easy to follow theme...the King of Glory. I would have given it five stars if the Scripture quotes had been from the Traditional Text instead of the NIV paraphrase, but Paul wants to attract a wide populace and language group. But, the final product in my opinion is well worth the price and of great value as an evangelist tool.",1444608000,3,382,4.632352941176471
7283217,3,B00ZK6IRZY,"It was very good and explained in such a loving way what the Lord did for us on the cross. Cartoon, but beautifully put together.",1443830400,,129,4.2
7283218,5,B00ZK6IRZY,"This is the best and most thorough presentation of the Gospel I have EVER seen, and I HIGHLY recommend it! Sometimes it is difficult telling the enormity of the Gospel in a conversation or even in a series of Bible lessons, but the way this movie was written was done in such a way that it so intricately yet broadly portrays the entirety of the Gospel in a beautiful and understandable way.

The art is just astounding - I can't say enough good things about it!!! I can tell the artist must have spent much time in prayer for guidance in knowing how to perfectly portray these images of the Bible, and I believe she greatly succeeded in doing that. My favorite visual was this image of a heart stained black with sin and the blood of Jesus would wash over it and make the heart cleansed of sin and become white as snow. That image was showed over and over again throughout the entire movie, and was just a reminder over and over again of what Jesus actually did for us when He died and shed His blood so we could live and be cleansed of our sins through Him. The artist's portrayal of Satan, demons, angels, and heaven were PERFECT. I don't know what those things all look like, but her art certainly opened my imagination to the wonders of what it must look like!

I love the choice they made for the Narrators voice - very moving, believable, and authentic.

The music and sound effects are AMAZING and moving...it really makes the movie.

The reason I think so highly of this movie is because I just finished watching it yesterday with my Sunday school class of K-2nd graders, and I can confidently say they all have a fuller understanding of the Gospel/Bible and love for the Lord Jesus Christ right now. All of them profess to ""have Jesus in my heart"", so it has been so sweet watching them grow closer to the Lord and see their eyes widen at what He has actually done for the world. Some of them even started sharing the Gospel with their friends at school and telling them they need to get their heart cleaned by Jesus - K-2nd graders!!! They excitedly were telling me they were trying to be a bright light of Jesus at school. Soo sweet :)

It took us about 9 weeks to get through the movie, because we watched 1 to 2 episodes per week (there are 15 episodes total which equals about 3 1/2 hours total). Each episode is approx. 15 minutes long, so it's just perfect for children! At first I wasn't sure how the kids would react to it, since children these days are so used to cartoon-y entertainment driven TV, but my kids absolutely LOVED it! Each week they couldn't wait to watch more.

For those of you who teach Sunday school to children who have been raised in the church, sometimes it's discouraging when the kids get bored or think they've heard all the Bible stories a million times, but when my kids watched this movie it was like it was the first time they had ever heard these stories! I think it just made the Bible come alive to them, and they understood it was the truth and REALLY happened, whereas something like Veggie Tales isn't believable to them. I was worried some scenes would be too ""scary"", like Jesus all beat up and bloody and some scary moments of Satan, but my kids weren't afraid at all, if anything it made them more aware of the seriousness of Jesus' death and of how bad Satan and sin really is. So that was one of my favorite aspects of this movie - the realism of it for showing it to children.

After each episode the kids were absolutely brimming with questions about anything and everything you can imagine. One of the two moments that stood out to me the most, was how crushed my students were when Adam and Eve ate the fruit. The whole 9 weeks my kids kept asking me why Adam and Eve would do such a horrible thing and why Satan would be so bad when God was so good to them? And then at the end when the King of Glory returns to heaven after He conquered the grave and the multitudes of angels were cheering for Him, all my kids started cheering because they were so excited and happy for Jesus' victory! hahaha :)

There were many times I was moved to tears throughout the movie in just being visually reminded of how amazing of a salvation plan God orchestrated in sending His Son to die for our sins, and how thankful I am that I have been washed in the blood of Christ and belong to Him. This movie is unique in that it really can reach all ages from children to adults. No matter where you are in life, there is just something about seeing a visual reminder of the Gospel that moves you to remember all that Christ has done for us, and makes you want to live all the more boldly for Him while we are here on earth for a short time.

I highly recommend using this movie as a tool for the Gospel in any capacity or for any age!",1441584000,6,4778,4.288248337028825
