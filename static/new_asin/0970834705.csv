7794276,5,0970834705,"Here is the bug, HOW COME the grand cherokee show the same mileage reading in different scenes?

Think about it.

Isn't it a bug? :-)

Beside this little bug, I love the movie so much.  And I just got enough reasons to buy my first Jeep!!!  Thank you guys!!!",1109894400,2,258,4.183673469387755
7794277,5,0970834705,"I love this video. The actual movie is only a few minutes long, but the tape also contains a very interesting ""Making of 405"" segment.
The computer generated special effects are beautiful (as an airline pilot I won't nitpick a couple of details that you will never notice unless you are familiar with the DC-10) and the computer effects are seamless with the real photography. In fact I would say that the compositing is better than most any big budget Hollywood movie I have ever seen (excepting maybe ""Apollo 13."")
I don't want to spoil any of it if you haven't seen it, but I can say that every single person I know that has seen it has loved it. Some airlines have even played it in recurrent training for pilots as a break from the serious business at hand.
You will love this video. Go get it post haste!",1062806400,23,810,4.406666666666666

7794281,5,0970834705,"I just saw this movie at a film festival in Seattle. Lucky me! If you can't see this on the big screen then you should buy it today. If you're a film buff, you'll want a copy of this ""early work"" from these guys! They're going to make it big, I predict. At least I hope so! C'mon guys, when's your first full length picture coming out?",999302400,4,335,4.014925373134329
7794282,5,0970834705,"A brilliantly conceived filmette, full of tension (and humor) that tricks the eye and mind into belief, then disbelief, then back again.  Yes, the largely computer generated incident is amazing, but the true talent is in its direction and editing.  Well worth the price of admission, and more substantial than many of today's full length features.",984787200,4,347,5.178571428571429
