To give some sense of context, these islands are close to home territory and are the source of much pleasure to this photographer, now 'retired' and living on the west coast of Scotland.

This 4 part series provides a year's view of three groups of the Hebrides Islands. Each episode lasts for about one hour and offers superb photography, sympathetic script and a very fair and understanding introduction to the wildlife and nature of these islands 'on the edge.'

Episode one focuses on the southern islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Oronsay. Episode two concentrates on Mull, Coll and Tiree. Episode three focuses on the more distant islands of Uist, Lewis, Harris, Benbecula and Barra leaving Episode four to complete the series by considering the future prospects of the Hebrides from the joint perspectives of the wildlife and the humans.

This is a very sensible and effective way of introducing viewers to the variety of wildlife, scenery and the challenges faced by all choosing to live on these islands.

Ewan McGregor clearly communicates his personal interest in the subject, as he did in the companion series Highlands-Scotland's Wild Heart, and this makes a positive impact rather than just listening to someone reading a script that is not of real interest to them.

As commented earlier. this series makes a very impressive introduction to this unique world of the Hebrides and may well encourage viewers to investigate further, and even visit the islands themselves. Those wanting greater depth may find that this series does not attempt to emulate David Attenborough in those ways but the photographic achievements are really superb and are a sufficient justification themselves for owning this set.

One quibble needs to be mentioned though, and this will be a matter of personal taste. The quibble concerns the constant background music, even swelling in climatic excitement, when the viewer is encouraged to appreciate the sounds of the calling geese for example. No chance! Perpetual background, middle ground and foreground lyrical but tuneless music now seems an obligatory feature of documentary films, even those wishing the viewer to hear the sounds of nature as here.

Regardless of that however, this 4 part series offers a superb and well thought-through introduction to the Hebrides, the unique Islands on Scotland's edge.",1477440000,,2373,5.20997375328084
