8687436,1,B00PCSVJT6,"This one really was terrible. The only thing that wasn't horrible was some of the music, but then again, it didn't really go with the movie. even the sound was terrible. Sometimes bad movies like this are unintentionally funny at some point but it struck out there too.",1462147200,,269,4.625

8687440,1,B00PCSVJT6,I'm sorry. I gave up after twenty minutes of nodding off from boredom. Maybe it gets better but there have got to be better movies out there somewhere. If there is the least amount of plot I can usually muddle through just about anything but this film is the exception. The abysmal acting doesn't help matters. The only high point was the shower scene when I actually laughed.,1446940800,2,376,4.544117647058823
