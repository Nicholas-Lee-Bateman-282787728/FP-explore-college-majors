Otherwise, it was a good purchase.  I left a review yesterday that disappeared.  I don't know how something like that happens.",1340496000,,291,5.0
3453341,4,B001AJ2YUE,"The Best Of The Andy Williams Show collects highlights from the show's various incarnations, some great and some not. The show ran regularly on NBC from 1962 till 1971. Some of the material here might be boring for some (they were to me) but some are really good. I really enjoyed the comedy sketch of Andy with Lorne Greene and Cass Elliot found on this set it show how fun TV was back in those days. Some of the other highlights on this set includes Andy performing for the first time on TV ""Where Do I Begin"" the title song for the movie ""Love Story"" as well as Judy Garland performing ""Over The Rainbow"". With that said I which I could have enjoyed the whole set but I didn't but what I did enjoyed, I really did enjoyed and for the price that they are going now is worth the try.",1330819200,,784,4.198675496688741
3453342,4,B001AJ2YUE,"I love early color videotape TV shows. There's a warmth to the color and it's great to see some really great entertainers, especially Bobby Darin. They leave in the original NBC peacock opening which is very nostalgic.",1294099200,3,218,4.918918918918919

8277749,1,B001AJ2YUE,"I love Andy Williams, his music and his manner but these videos are horribly edited and WAY too short.  They are not complete shows, even though they include commercials ?  The Andy Williams Show was one of he best Music-Comedy Variety shows on TV but you cannot tell from the poorly-edited tapes. So much potential but so little payoff.  I KNOW Andy could have gotten someone to mix these for free, the shows were great and any fan would love to review them all and pick out the ""Best of"" and made ten, much-longer DVDs of much better material. It IS nice to see a few duets and trios and I would loved to have seen more Andy solos as well.  Sometimes the bear was funny as was Johnathan Winters, but none of that is on the ""Best of "" videos...",1429056000,,745,4.26241134751773

8277756,5,B001AJ2YUE,"Got this for my Mom, Andy Williams was one of her favorite singers. It was a real blast from the past! She really likes it! And the shows included on the dvd have some really great guests -  Robert Goulet, Judy Garland, Woody Allen, Tony Bennett, and do you remember Cliff Arquette (Charlie Weaver)? We used to see him on the Ed Sullivan show when I was a kid. And it was great to see Mama Cass Elliot again. Cute comedy skits that include the guest stars, along with singing, it's classic tv at its best. If you like entertainers from that era, you'll love this dvd!",1378252800,3,567,4.299065420560748
8277757,3,B001AJ2YUE,"Bought this as a gift for Mother, and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Was great how Amazon was able to list it based on my search for a star who was a guest on one episode of Andy's show. For this reason I'm glad I bought it. Not sure how many times she'll enjoy viewing it, though.",1361577600,,277,3.9642857142857144
