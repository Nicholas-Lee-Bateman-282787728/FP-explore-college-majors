8324654,5,B00004LC7S,"I bought this video because I was desperate for material to entertain my high school disc club on rainy days.  I am the faculty moderator for a couple of dozen high school disc throwers.  We play golf every Tuesday and ultimate on Thursdays.  This week I showed the H.O.E. video and afterward they ran to the gym.  The kids lit up as they began to excel at a previously unachieved pace.  I have been playing for years and finally I learned how these throws work.  The most beneficial part is that I can teach them now.  In addition this video is helping my kids learn the philosophy behind the sport that has taken many of us a long time to understand.  The video is simple and straightforward, nothing too fancy and totally in keeping with what hucking a disc is all about.  If you want to learn very quickly how to flick, skip or pitch a disc with predictable accuracy this is a great video.",1099958400,2,893,4.363636363636363
