652920,4,6303450849,"This is a locally made movie, so my expectations were low. It was a gripping tale. First, the characters were all thoroughly likable, none of the Hollywood clich petty cruelties and insults. The landscapes are spectacular and menacing. The imaginative use of mixed sound and music gives a heightened sense of reality. Even though I saw it on a relatively small screen, it has much of the emotional impact of IMAX. Of course yellow dog steals the show since she is so sincere. This is not a cute film, but a rather scary tale of getting lost, survival and rescue.

Only in retrospect did I wonder how the climatic scene was done. I still wonder if everyone, including yellow dog risked their necks to shoot it. The natural world dangers in the film were similar to dangers I have lived myself, so they seemed ever so much more frightening than guns and bombs. It would be a bit too frightening for small children.

Even though I knew I was being heavily manipulated by the inevitable happy ending, I could not help myself from bursting into tears.",1124668800,14,1046,4.618279569892473
652921,5,6303450849,"The cover of our DVD of ""Far From Home"" says in large letters: ""Family Feature"".  And a great family movie it is.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that this is just another dog movie, in this case the adventures of a Labrador named ""Yellow"".  Even more it is about the adventures of his young master Angus.  Angus acquires Yellow when the dog appears on the family property, apparently lost, and soon the boy and his dog become firm friends.  When Angus and Yellow are marooned in wilderness country after the sinking of his father's ship, it is their combined strength that is required to survive the rugged coastline, vast forests, and hostile wildlife.

Most of the conflict revolves around this very real struggle against the elements, leading up to a suspenseful and heartwarming conclusion.  But along with this suspense comes excellent and convincing characterization.  More than just an adventure story, ""Far From Home"" is ultimately a coming-of-age story, as Angus learns about responsibility and survival.  In the process, his relationships with his father and with his dog are especially well-portrayed.

Although the movie is ""clean"", I would not recommend this movie for younger children under 10 mainly because of its capacity to evoke strong emotions of fear (there are some scary moments involving a sinking ship during a storm, a wolf attack, and a perilous log crossing over a ravine) and grief (it's hard to hold back the emotions experienced at losing a missing child).  But with this depth of emotion, older children and adults alike will find it a real tear-jerker.  When combined with good acting and some lovely cinematography of beautiful rugged British Columbia, this movie is definitely a drama worth keeping for the family. - GODLY GADFLY",1092441600,38,1773,5.034246575342466
652922,5,6303450849,"well,this just goes to show why you don't blindly accept a critics review. I own a yellow lab(2) and I can tell you this is a pretty realistic. Yes I guess the critics would like to see a gloom and doom ending but I don't think they heard of the true story of when one of these trmendously faithful conpanions carried his master half a mile back to his home after he suffered a near fatal heart attack(would have been fatal if not for yellows actions). It is a very heartwarming  story without being predictable and just fantastic views. The heck with critics. Buy this because it makes you feel good and that there wasn't a need for explosions or car chases or guns to provide for interesting viewing.",1070064000,54,702,4.441860465116279
652923,5,6303450849,"I bought this for my son when he was five years old.  I wanted to purchase something that was not a cartoon, but would still fit into his age group.  He still watches it at ten years old, and we now have his younger brother joining in.  I haven't found anyone who doesn't enjoy this video.  His great grandmother even enjoyed it.  It is a video good for both young and old alike.",1037664000,12,379,4.136986301369863
652924,4,6303450849,Our family really enjoys this movie.  The story is not terribly predictable and the actors all do a solid job.  Beautiful scenery and enough action to keep the little ones engaged.  Should be on DVD.  We'll add it to our collection.,1034035200,5,232,4.585365853658536
652925,5,6303450849,I disagree with the reviewers who said the movie was predictable and drawn out.  It was a movie with heart and you could feel the main characters plight when he lost his companion.  Being an animal lover I was pulling for the happy ending (of Course).  I am Disney's biggest fan and I love this movie right along with the others. (P.S.  I am a Grandmother to eleven.)  Thank heavens for Disney Movies.,997315200,5,401,4.438356164383562
652926,5,6303450849,"I would beg to differ with the above description of the film. This is not the typical ""A-boy-and-his-pet"" film. The story is more realistic than the typical film of its genre such as ""Flipper"" or  ""Lassie"" and lacks the obvious manipulations of an ""Air  Bud."" The characters look like real people. (Watch how Angus' little  brother dresses himself. Anyone who has been around a six-year old can see  their child dressing like this). Angus's and Yellow's fight through the  wilderness is not glossed over or ""Disneyfied."" The  cinematography is beautiful. This film is wonderful for the whole family,  not just for the six-year old.",964915200,20,631,5.009615384615385

653173,5,6303450849,"I bought this film probably a decade ago, to add to my collection. Decided to write a review after revisiting it tonight.

First of all, the only complaint I have about the film is it isn't on Blu Ray. Hopefully one day that will change. The copy of it, that I own, is a double sided DVD. One side is full screen, and the other side is widescreen. In this day & age it's redundant to offer a full screen format.

The movie itself is a great family film. I admittedly have a soft spot for it, due to nostalgia about my childhood. Although it is an older film, it still has a great story, doesn't look too dated, and was one of the better 90's kid films. Anyone who has ever loved a dog will enjoy this film!",1490227200,,706,4.071942446043166

653180,1,6303450849,"Stereotype of wolves as gratuitously vicious toward humans was unnecessary to make yellow dog look valiant. Also, preposterous to portray yellow dog as capable of driving off a wolf, much less a pair.

Good scenery, reasonably good acting would otherwise qualify as good family fare, but children should not be indoctrinated with medieval myth of vicious wolves in the forest.",1486771200,,376,5.266666666666667

653265,5,6303450849,"Very  good  movie  about  surviving,  During  a  storm  Angus  says  to  his  Dad  that  he  must  check  his  boat.  A  dog  &  his  young  owner  must  do  what  they  can  for  about  2 1/2  weeks  before  being  rescued.  Looking  for  the  boy  Angus  Mc Cormick  (Bruce Davidson)  does  cost  a  lot  of  money.  &  it  out  there  where  there  is  so  many  trees  &  mountains  its  like  trying  to  find  a  needle  in  a  haystack.  The  dog  was  lucky  not  to  hit  the  rocks  when  he  fell  back  into  the  river  when  they  were  found  in  the  ravine.  They  fight  off  a  pack  of  wolves,  mountain lions.  Out  there  in  the  wilderness  your  skills  &  knowledge  are  put  to  the  test.  He  had  to  decide  what  his  best  chances  were  of  someone  finding  him,  were  they  (Him  staying  put  until  someone  sees  him)  He  mentions  to  his  dog  that  he  didn't  want  to  starve,  The  dog  himself  was  absent  off  &  on,  hunting  for  game  or  perhaps  a  dead  deer  carcass,  making  circles  to  make  sure  there  weren't  anymore  vicious  animals  close  by.  I  think  that's  what  the  dog  was  doing.  He  does  consider  hiking  to  a  small  cabin  on  the  mountain  to  be  better  off  attracting  attention  from  a  plane  or  helicopter.  He  finds  no  food.  Here  in  this  movie  the  bond  between  Angus  &  his  dog  is  so  strong  they're  inseparable.  &  the  dog  suffers  no  injuries  in  the  movie  at  all,  near  the  end  it  hurts  to  lose  a  pet  whether  or  not  its  permanent  or  temporary.  The  dog  finds  his  way  home,  That's  the  best  part  about  the  movie.  He  wasn't  a  goner.  In  real  life  you  can't  always  expect  to  see  your  dog  again.  Not  all  of  them  find  their  way  home.  This  one  did,  &  that's  what  makes  the  ending  so  good.  Angus  had  received  a  whistle  that  came  in  real  handy  in  the  dog  food  bag  which  was  designed  for  the  sound  to  travel  a  long  ways.  I  think  dogs  are  everything.  The  boy  never  gave  up  his  faith,  nor  being  confident.  I  think  that's  what  I  like  about  the  movie.  &  he  used  every  method  he  could  think  of.  Being  ready  for  a  new  plan  in  case  the  plan  he  had  before  failed.  Dogs  are  good  company  in  those  types  of  situations.
I'd  recommend  this  movie  to  anyone  who  loves  dogs!!!",1474848000,2,2431,4.110275689223058

653268,5,6303450849,"Feel Good Movie that tugs at your heart.  I saw this movie when it first appeared in the movies, and recently, played it for my son for our family movie night.

At first, it was a little slow and hard to get into it.  By today's standards (2016), we've become accustomed to having action from the get go rather than a slow developing story.  So I had to encourage my son to stick with it.  And he did.  And then the action came and he was GLUED TO HIS SEAT. And then....He jumped, yelled, screamed, and dare I say...cried.

This is one movie that every boy should watch -- and to not be sexists -- every girl as well.  It's about the bond between a boy and his dog. It's about friendship.  It's about never giving up.  It's about life.  It's about hope.",1470960000,2,753,4.195804195804196

653402,1,6303450849,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

There are some inconsistencies, however, like a dog that can fight off a pack of wolves, but can't handle a single bobcat or lynx.  It's another feel good story, but if you're a dog lover (and I am), it's certainly worth the watch.  Add a star if you're a dog lover.

I agree with many that the movie is full of predictable events, i.e. the dog protecting his master from a wild animal, and the two getting separated.  Yes the ending is also assumed before it happens, yet it tugs at your heart strings.  The reviewer that gave it only one star in my opinion must not have watched the same movie.

The supporting actors do a great job of being just that, supporting actors. They don't try to upstage Jesse, but within their individual roles, they pull the whole story line together.

This story reaffirms the relationship between a canine companion and his owner. Still only a boy, circumstances leave him to survive in the woods. His dog follows him, stays by his side, protects him, and they share everything.
The boy is finally located. They abandon the dog.

655629,3,6303450849,"I'm sorry to be such a Scrooge with Christmas rapidly approaching, but while watching Far From Home- The Adventures of Yellow Dog tonight, it sort of struck me as boring.  I was expecting a family-oriented film that focuses on a teenager and his dog struggling to make it after a terrible boat accident leaves them stranded along the rocky coasts of British Columbia, and the film delivers in that respect but... it just *barely* delivers.

The entire presentation feels really bloated and exaggerated to me which is typical of early to mid 90's adventure films.  A film that certainly LOOKS really good and I imagine a lot of time was devoted to making it, and I remember back in the mid 90's how these type of animal movies won the hearts of everyone who had an affection for them, but as the years pass and technology and filmmaking changes, I find a movie like this just isn't very fun to watch anymore.

I can't remember if this film was produce by Disney but it definitely *feels* like it was.  My biggest problem is that the actual survival story between the teenager and his dog was incredibly shallow.

Yes they collect bugs, kill animals when they get hungry enough, encounter dangerous wildlife animals such as wolves and wild cats, but... it's just not enough.  These segments feel undeveloped and uncreative.  It's just not enough entertainment and doesn't offer a darn thing as far as originality is concerned either.  It's completely missing anything TRULY enticing.

Yes, the parents are worried that their teenage boy is missing.  Interesting though that it never seemed to cross the mind of either those searching for the boy or his parents (with the exception of one scene) that he might be dead.  It was also strange how it was just assumed the boy would make it on land.  I'd be flying planes over the ocean first.

If that was MY son out there missing in the woods, you better believe I'd fear the worst.  Granted, there was one really good emotional segment where the father looks into a mirror and cries his eyes out while his wife comforts him, but eh... that was just one moment of sincerity surrounded by a subtle belief that the boys life was never *truly* in danger.  Not very appealing or accurate storytelling.

The fact the film is barely 75 minutes long is another problem, and even though everyone loves the dramatic and touching ending, I've seen better.  Actually had the entire movie been dramatic and memorable like the ending, it would have been even better.

Personally I feel Homeward Bound is a LOT better because that movie utilizes not just a compelling story of animal survival, but humor as well.  A much better movie than this one.",1323043200,,2678,4.706008583690987

The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home, his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy. If you want predictable, watch a survival movie. What happens, almost always, is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident, they struggle to survive, they are found, and then brought home. ""Far From Home"" is no exception. As for unnecessary, the whole ""romance"" part of this movie was badly done and not needed. The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home, and all the while, the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse. Also some parts of this movie might upset young children, such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow can't be rescued.

655949,3,6303450849,"Decades ago children were entertained and educated by traditional stories (called Fairy Tales) which ended with some moral lesson. Many of them were so gruesome as to be censored or changed for 20th century tastes. Their rationale was to warn children about an evil world and its dangers. It was not a colorful cartoon where a cat played with mice or a fox with hens. Most of all they taught children the importance of obeying their parents and not advertisers on TV.

This film begins with a teenage boy running through the woods. Will he shoot a hare with his slingshot? [This is false, a .22 rifle or a 20 gauge shotgun is more likely.] What about that stray dog? Angus learns to drive a truck but doesn't brake in time. The new yellow dog provides some comedy. [The brown grass suggests California.] Can they afford a dog? [Do people in rural areas need a dog license?] John McCormick pilots his small boat to deliver goods to a customer. Is the boat too small for that big ocean? A huge wave hits the boat and overturns it. Rescue aircraft save the father, but Angus is lost. The son and the yellow dog survive in a small boat to land on the rugged shore. They hunt for fish and clams for food. After a few days Angus decides to walk south to the light house; but they can't. It is cold and rainy. Are there wild animals? Can they trap small animals for food. Biscuits for bait? [No wild berries for food?]

Can Angus find a path to the south? The searchers find the boat, Angus would be rescued if he remained where he landed! [Would those searchers travel unarmed in the wilderness?] More days pass for Angus and his Labrador. Will they find food? [Angus appears well fed.] Finally the searchers find their man. ""They found him"" is the message, the tone says good news. A helicopter lifts Angus to safety, the yellow dog falls to the water below. [Was any animal harmed in this film?] The search ends because of the budget. Will the yellow dog eventually return for a happy ending?

This entertaining story tells about life in the Pacific Northwest wilderness. The moral is: if you are ever lost stay in one place to increase your chance of being found. A smoky fire would have helped. [Do you know how to start a fire if you don't have a match?]",1246924800,3,2253,4.450363196125908

The two have survives and are trying to find their way back to civilization.  Will they be able to survive and be reunited with their family?

This movie is fairly standard and innocuous family fare.  It is a little slow at times, especially in the beginning while things are set up.  It is fairly predictable.  But it is entertaining.  Kids will enjoy it more than their parents.  My biggest complaint was actually the short scenes.  Many things are introduced and resolved too quickly, never giving any plot point time to be fully developed.  At the same time, I did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfying.

The film could have been much better but does grow on you.  Don't rush out to see it, but there's no reason to avoid it either.",1222819200,,1284,4.537117903930131

655954,3,6303450849,"I love dogs and I really wanted to love this film.  Unfortunately I didn't find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but perhaps I didn't find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this.  Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds.  Also it seemed that they didn't spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog. (The movie is short; not even 1 1/2 hours.) It's a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring.  The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog can't be rescued, but don't worry as it has a happy ending.  It's an okay movie, but I expected a lot more.  I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy (like Shrek II).  This is definately one mainly just for the kids.  So many things that kids can't or shouldn't watch.  This is one that anyone can watch, which is a big plus.  Probably would have been better as a TV movie and would easily fit in a 2-hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials.",1168473600,3,1145,4.2304147465437785
655955,4,6303450849,"Young Jesse Bradford gives a heartwarming performance as Angus, a young lad who adopts a labrador and names it Yellow Dog.  On a sailing trip with father Bruce Davison (effective in a non-typical role), he and the dog are thrown overboard and faced with surviving in uncharted Pacific Northwest.  Mimi Rogers plays Angus' mother, and the parents' dedication in believing their son is still alive is touching as well.  Although the movie doesn't give us a lot of ""adventures"" with the boy and his dog, it nonetheless focuses on Angus' survival skills and the devotion of his dog.  One particularly poignant scene involves a rabbit.  Early in the film, Bradford and his buddies are chasing a rabbit and he has the opportunity to kill it with his slingshot but upon seeing the cute little thing, he scares it away.  When he is lost, a rabbit is once again caught by the dog and Angus realizes the difference between hunting for play and for survival.  An enjoyable family film.",1154822400,5,974,4.761904761904762

655957,5,6303450849,"You don't have to own a Yellow Lab to absolutley love this movie, but true dog lovers will find it irrestible. A young boy takes in a lost Yellow lab, and despite his parents reservations allow him to keep the dog. The boy and the dog become very close and forge a bond that is put to the test when they are lost in boat accident and end up stranded on a remote island. The dog stays by the young boy's side as they struggle to survive, find food, and battle a pack of wolves. All this happens while his parents and the coast guard desperately search for him.

 After many weeks pass the Coast Guard believes they may never be found, but the dog and the boy do survive as they gain strength through each others love and devotion. It has an unusual ending, which I don't want to spoil, but Yellow Dog is one movie, although simple in structure, that really captures the true relationship that a boy and a dog can have that transcends even human friendships.",1154304000,9,956,4.305555555555555
655958,5,6303450849,"As owners of a Yellow Lab, we just might be a bit biased, but we were mesmerized by this movie.

The adventures of a lost boy and dog.  Of course the ending is predictable.  We knew that.  But the story line, the fabulous scenery, the cinematography, the acting, the sub-plots and the adventure make this a must-see movie for the whole family - Preview it before showing it to the very young; they might be traumatized by the scary parts.
