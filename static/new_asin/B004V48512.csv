8746959,5,B004V48512,"Well firstly I have to say this is one of the better instalments in the Erotic Ghost story trilogy. It has a much better atmosphere, cinematography  & authenticity than the other two movies combined and all the clones  which have been introduced over the years. The first thing I noticed about  this movie was the passable standard of acting (which is quite rare in  these asian exploitation films) combined with the impossible yet satisfing  script. The second you start watching this movie you are drawn into what  the director tryed to turn this cult classic into originally, and has  finally succeded in this episode. I would buy this DVD edition to take  advantage of this great film and maybe see the fantastic camera work and  special effects in the sharper picture quality of the DVD format. And if  you are an asian film lover, cult collector, or just appreciate difference  and originality in film of high standard, this is one for you. get it -  you'll be pleasently surprised!",967852800,30,988,4.781065088757397
