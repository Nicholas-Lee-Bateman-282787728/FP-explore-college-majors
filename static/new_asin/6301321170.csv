7811035,4,6301321170,"I was pleasantly surprised by this potboiler. It's not a masterpiece or exemplary film by any stretch, but it is definitely entertaining, it really moves (great editing), it kept my interest throughout (it should since it clocks-in at about 83 minutes), and the acting was above par (especially the work of the late, great Bill Hunter as well as some solid acting by the other leads). The one real downside to the film is a poor soundtrack; it almost seems like the music was recorded at someone's home using a Casio Keyboard and this aspect solidly dates the film (you can't mistake it for any decade other than the 80s). If you enjoy Australian films or mystery/thriller productions I recommend that you give this a look-see.",1348099200,,727,4.777777777777778
