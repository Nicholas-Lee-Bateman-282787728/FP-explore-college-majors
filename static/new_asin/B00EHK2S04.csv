5912355,5,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium is the logical conclusion of a Survival-of-the-Fittest philosophy currently espoused by many Republicans, Tea Party fanatics and the apolitical, super rich. Greed and selfishness is the Law-of-the-Land in Elysium! Don't bother healing the critically ill on Earth with amazing life saving technology. If the sick are not one of the rich and powerful living aboard the giant ocean-liner-in-space then let 'em drop dead in the streets! This is a place where Ayn Rand would be King!

Elysium is the ultimate gated community! A wet dream for any rich and powerful person who sees the rest of us as a threat. The corporations and their lackeys in government, the courts and the press literally turn the earth into one giant cesspool and then they get to escape to a corporate utopia in outer space! All I can say is: God help us all!

Films like Elysium are a wake-up call to help prevent what might actually happens someday if the course the vast majority of the world is on is not changed!

5912357,1,B00EHK2S04,"Matt Damon looked really old in this film.  Reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger
in his last movie ""Last Stand"".  The character he played did not come off as
a person ""down on their luck"" ... more of being someone who has made bad decisions
all their life and had not learned anything from the consequences of their bad decisions.
No charisma.  A real bummer.

OK, the slow motion explosion shots were really good and kept me in my seat for 2/3's of the
movie.  Damon's poor acting chased me out before the end.  Damon today no longer has the charisma of Bourne
of yesterday.  Nether does Schwarzenegger.  Amazingly, Sly Stallone still does ... in spades!",1376006400,20,655,4.6347826086956525
5912358,3,B00EHK2S04,"In 2009, director Neill Blomkamp made his feature debut with the sci-fi drama, District 9 - about the segregation of aliens in a South American internment camp, called District 9.  This film was shot on a relatively conservative budget of $30 million and went on to gross more than $200 million worldwide.  Not only did the film perform well at the box office, but it was also highly praised by fans and critics, and even went on to earn four Academy Award nominations - including a nomination for Best Picture.  The overwhelming success of District 9 has obviously set an elevated bar for Neill Blomkamp and his next film.  In his second endeavor, Blomkamp once again returns to the world of sci-fi, re-teaming with his former District 9 star, Sharlto Copley, and adding Matt Damon in the politically and sociologically driven film, Elysium.

Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9), Elysium stars Matt Damon as Max, a former car thief turned factory worker.  After an accident at work, Max is exposed to a high dose of radiation, giving him only five days left to live.  He turns to a powerful underground associate, called Spider (Wagner Moura), to help him get to the off-earth space station, Elysium.  The home to the richest members of earth's desolate society, Elysium also houses the technology to heal the sick and dying.  However, before Spider will send Max to Elysium, he must first kidnap a wealthy member of society and extract vital, profitable information.  Unfortunately, things don't always work out as planned for Max.  Jodie Foster, Alice Braga, William Fichtner, and Sharlto Copley also star in supporting roles.

With so many different incarnations of sci-fi and desolate futures, it can be taxing to stay original.  The story of Elysium is certainly an interesting story, full of innuendos about wealth vs. poverty, but more importantly - the film doesn't feel like other sci-fi films.  Sure, it throws in elements of Total Recall, Gattaca, and even Terminator, but Elysium doesn't feel like a knock-off, rip-off flick that a studio or filmmaker made just for the sake of making a movie.  However, as soon as Matt Damon dawns this exoskeleton suit, it's hard not to think about Robocop - or even a variation of Darth Vader.  The weaponry, which fire like normal weapons, suddenly morph into devastatingly catastrophic weapons.  Shades of Judge Dredd, perhaps?  And, what's with Sharlto Copley's character having some random impenetrable shielding device?  For a film that feels like a down-to-earth sci-fi story, it doesn't take long for it to incorporate elements that severely feel out of place.

Matt Damon is one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, so it shouldn't be a surprise to hear that he brings his A-game to Elysium.  While he did train intensively for this role - not to mention shave his head, his character can be a bit clunky at times.  There's little doubt that his character, Max, is meant to do something special with his life, but at the same time, Max is a desperate and tragic character.  He realizes early on in the film that he wants to live, although he never really shows what it is he wants to live for - other than himself.  He connects briefly with his childhood friend, Fray (Alice Braga), but feels little remorse for her daughter's detrimental health.  And, it is pretty outlandish that he takes such physical punishment without consequence over the course of the film - having his arm broke, being stabbed, going through major constructive surgery, and receiving a full dose of radiation.  It is pretty astonishing that this character can go from the fetal position one minute to someone that's stronger than everyone else the next.  Still, Damon looks pretty awesome with his Hitman-look and tailor made suit, so much so that he (at times) completely overshadows the film, which really isn't what Neill Blomkamp was hoping for with this flick.

Visually speaking, Elysium looks very similar to District 9, making it extremely plausible that both films could take place in the same film universe.  Both films take place in rundown, destitute societies - with the main difference being one is an alien quarantine, while in Elysium, the story's main city of Los Angeles is filled with poor, sick people that are struggling for survival.  It's essentially the same premise, only each film takes place on the other side of the planet.  Aside from the locations, the film relies on CGI, but not enough to make it look abusive or unnecessary.  Anytime off world interaction takes place, odds are CGI will come into play, and although the CGI isn't the best, the concept of the Elysium station and the spaceships are still visually engaging enough to sell the story as a serious sci-fi drama.  On a side note, it's actually nice to see some space travel that doesn't involve massive Star Trek-looking spaceships, filled with warm speed and unavoidable alien encounters.

Overall, Elysium is a solid story, but it's not on par with District 9.  Matt Damon is a relatively major draw in the film industry, so he might be enough to put butts in seats.  However, the film is far from an enjoyable thrill ride, featuring strange characters (mostly the villains), and flawed messages of political corruption and the implication that rich people are evil.  Despite its flaws, Elysium is still an enjoyable film, all-be-it clichd and troublesome at times with its character development.  Sadly, Jodie Foster presence in the film is hardly worth mentioning and her skillset is basically wasted, only sharing one brief scene with Damon.  In any event, Matt Damon offsets the obvious flaws, making this film a recommendable feature - only if you're into cataclysmic future action stories, though (and who isn't?).  There's very little doubt that this film definitely caters to those of us that have an acquired taste for sci-fi chaos.

5912359,4,B00EHK2S04,"Did you see ""District 9?"" I did. I found it audacious and memorable, so I've been looking forward to ""Elysium"" ever since I discovered Neill Blomkamp was the director. In this one, it is the year 2154 and only the rabble continues to live in squaller on a ruined Earth; the wealthy live on an orbiting space station called Elysium, where equality is the last thing on their minds...sort of like a gated community...

On both habitats, the residents speak a polyglot of English, Spanish, French, and other assorted tongues. When the dialogue isn't in English, there are captions to help us out. (A person who speaks three languages is trilingual; two languages, bilingual; one language, American.)

Look at this cast:
  * Matt Damon (The ""Bourne"" franchise) is Max, a former felon determined to meet the terms of his parole and stay out of jail. He has never forgotten his little playmate Frey, now grown up and a medico in the chaos of Earth.
  * Alica Braga (""On the Road"") is Frey; even though she's a doctor, the equipment to cure her daughter of acute leukemia is up on Elysium and she has no legal way to get there.
  * Diego Luna (""Casa de mi Padre"") is Julio, Max's loyal friend.
  * Jodie Foster (""The Beaver"") is Delacourt, the Frenchwoman in charge of security on Elysium. She takes her job very, very seriously.
  * Sharlto Copley (""The A-Team"") is Kruger, Delacourt's enforcer.

We see a large, capable cast. The horrific industrial accident that causes our hero to have radiation poisoning feels authentic and his subsequent medical treatment made me hide my eyes.

This is an R-rated actioner, so expect oodles of profanity and a lot of gun play, plus endless fisticuffs and blowie uppie stuff. There are no sweaty bodies but Damon can convey affection with just a crooked smile.

Of course we see almost non-stop Computer Generated Imaging...sigh...but the ramshackle vehicles, both land and air made me think of ""Mad Max.""

Note: Key bits of dialogue are difficult to understand, so if you have any hearing concerns, find a theater with closed captions or wait for the DVD from Amazon.",1375920000,9,2101,4.778393351800554

Bad acting all around (especially by Jodi Foster which really surprised me) except for the South African actor, S. Copley--wow, he chewed up the scenery, spit it out and had room for more!

The problem is that the writers had an idea--let's put rich people in space--and then didn't know where to go after that. I was so bored, but kept hoping it would improve. It didn't. You could predict the plot almost from the very beginning. No, I won't spoil it here, but just choose one from Column A, two from Column B and add hero and obvious ending. Voila, you're a Hollywood writer.

5912447,5,B00EHK2S04,"Blonkamp's vision is soo original and developed in extreme depth, it's hard not to be completely fascinated by the world he proposes. Even for brief scenes, enormous amounts of prop development and preproduction are brought to bear. This movie is very well edited, and very economic in it's character development. The memory scenes of Max and a small boy are so critical to our understanding of the antagonist. I have watched this movie over 20 times, and I still love the pace. There is no movie structured like this. There are some huge leaps that are easy to accept once you understand that they each move the action forward at a hectic rate. This movie starts off at 100% and there is not a single moment to rest until the end. One thing I like about Blonkamp's aesthetic is how character death is never the result of a bullet being fired, though there are many fired. He likes to display the cheapness and uselessness of bullets, preferring a sword, a fist fight, or some exotic explosive to be the killing blow. This is a stand alone movie, it begins and ends very conclusively. I wish it could have been universally popular enough for a company to make toys, because the robots and airships are soo awesome.

The solution the movie provides is so stupid it makes me wonder if a child wrote that part of the script. (Spoiler, potentially: It will likely be undone minutes later by some other programmer.)

It touches on immigration, the 'rich' privilege, the inner drive to survive, and the disregard of the less unfortunate and poor. In this feature, Matt Damon plays an anti-hero. He's out to save himself initially, but ends up doing a lot more. I thought he was great and very believable. I felt his pain in my heart, and I was rooting for him. Unfortunately, I didn't like Jody Foster in this movie. I thought she was stiff and not very convincing.

In this delightful sci-fi film, which can be interpreted as a parable on life today, the rich vs. the poor, although in the film the depiction is of the future, there are two places: The Elysium which is an ideal huge satellite where life is wonderful, where robots aid humans to enjoy life, and earth which is filled with squalor, where people are sick, where they are controlled, robots are police who keep them in check, and many citizens turn to crime to have sufficient food to eat. On Elysium there are no sick people because there is a machine that cures all their ills. The leaders of Elysium do not allow the earth people to come to Elysium for any reason, including forbidding them to use their machine. On earth, there are many sick people who want to go to Elysium to get well.
There are people on earth who want to take control of Elysium and people on Elysium who want to snatch control from those who currently have it. There are also many, if not all thinking people, on earth who want to go to Elysium for a better life and to cure their health.",1486339200,,1286,4.3625

If the planet has been drained of resources, if the best, brightest, and wealthiest have been brought to Elysium to preserve the human race, then the actions in this film and its ending are not logical.  Emotional decision making is why the planet was in such a poor state in the first place.

5912552,3,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium
 Writer/director Neill Blomkamp burst upon the eyeballs of the worlds movie audiences with District 9 not long ago.  District 9 was a visually arresting film which turned out to be staggeringly profitable as intrigued watchers thronged to see it all around the globe.  Blomkamp is back as the writer/director of Elysium.
 Elysium is a very stylish Sci-Fi romp which serves as a star vehicle for Matt Damon, who appears as the extremely fit hero in a dystopian future Earth.  If we can see the DNA of District 9 in the visual style of Elysium, we sadly miss the manic originality of the previous film.  Supporting Damon (who carries the film) is Jodie Foster who scowls her way through her depiction of the ruthless bad lady and the very experienced and competent William Fichtner who has a smaller role.  The other actors are not familiar to most of us and their characters exist only as plot devices.
 This is the third major Sci-Fi film of the year and will probably be the best attended.  Writer Blomkamp rummaged for images, ideas and themes through the vast world of Science Fiction films and plucked those ideas and whatnot that he chose.  Patching together a bunch of well used ideas is not the same as bring up original ideas, even if it is done with energy and style.  And Director Blomkamp does keep things moving along at a merry pace.
 A century from now the rulers of earth, an infinitesimal minority of the super rich, live off planet on a lovely space station named Elysium.  They have everything including medical technology that makes people more or less immortal, at least very long lived.  The masses live in festering slums right out of the third world.  How such a society came about is not even guessed at.  Damon is a former delinquent and orphan who is trying against all odds to be a good and obedient citizen but runs afoul of a heartless and oppressive government.  He sustains an on the job radiation exposure which condemns him to slow death.  This motivates him to seek illegal entry to the space station and its medical arts.
 There are no surprises as Damon battles his way through human and robotic foes.  There is a subplot about his childhood friend and her daughter which would have been more important and moving with only a little bit of a re-write.
 Elysium is properly rated R for very intense violence.  The stylish but lacking two and a half saw blade film is one hour and 49 minutes long.  With a budget of $115 and an opening weekend estimated to be in the low $40 million range, it might eke out a profit at some point.
 Watch it for the pace and the pleasure of seeing a buff and sculpted Matt Damon in a role usually reserved for Dwayne Johnson.",1471305600,,2700,4.577083333333333

5912557,4,B00EHK2S04,"When I first saw trailers for this movie, I thought ""Heck, I'm SO READY for Jodie Foster as a cold-hearted Italian arch-villain in space,"" not to mention a thematic and visual sequel to 'District 9,' one of the most unexpected and refreshing additions to the science fiction film canon I've seen in the last decade.  And truly, there IS a lot to like here--Damon is predictably broody and muscular, Foster is the stuff of nightmares, and Sharlto Copley is predictably (and wildly) over-the-top as a completely nutso gun-for-hire.  Alice Braga steals every scene he's in, however, and his exit from the main story leaves a gaping hole that is supposed to serve as an emotional catalyst for much of the Damon's protagonist to carry out his infiltration of the space station--but here's where the movie fails, in my opinion.  Foster's strength, as it turns out, is in creating powerful emotional dynamics with her fellow actors--truly at evidence in 'Contact'--but she and Damon's character are never, as it turns out, in the same room.  There's no time or space for them to develop the kind of arch-nemesis chemistry that's really necessary to drive a film like this, and while Copley's merc might have filled that void (since he is, in fact, in the same room as Damon--and often) he was too violently insane for chemistry of any kind other than utter repulsion.

All this said, I think the base concept of 'Elysium' is an interesting one, even if it in many ways touches on the same socioeconomic disparities that were so beautifully captured in 'District 9.'  And hey, it looks pretty cool.  And hey, Matt Damon getting the world's most hideous prosthetic embedded into his skull on-screen isn't so bad.  Right?",1470700800,,1711,4.875862068965517

5912559,3,B00EHK2S04,"This was watchable and entertaining with great special effects and visuals as well as an interesting concept.  The concept could've been a spectacular one if they had realistically developed it a bit more.  It seemed as if they were trying to prove some social commentary point where the bad guys are rich white people and the good guys are everyone else trying to survive.  With that respect, it was badly stereotypical.  This movie left me walking out with questions that were never answered. It felt more like a let down after an exhilarating ride with no real emotional payback. This film lacked in emotion, but maybe that was the point. This had a distant coldness with some interesting moments sprinkled lightly throughout that kept me interested.

Elysium is a space station city built by humans for the super wealthy. They abandoned Earth because of how destroyed humankind made it. It's around the year 2154 and those who are poor or of low means are stuck on Earth. In this case the story takes place in Los Angeles looking as if it's been hit my apocalyptic economic destruction.  It's not that far off from how some pockets of Los Angeles are today, so this future projection by the filmmakers may or may not be an exaggeration.

Those who are wealthy all escaped to a place called Elysium which can be seen in the sky from Earth.  Elysium is filled with perfect breathable air, mansions, and the wealthy lounging around with tight perfect bikini clad bodies in pools. I found this odd.  Do they not doing anything besides looking incredible in bikinis sipping drinks and marinating in mansion pools?  To title the movie Elysium you'd think a little more creativity could've been put into the place.  Everyone on Elysium seems to be white and wealthy, but ironically the President is black. I think he may have been the only black person on Elysium and he doesn't have much of a part. Pops in a few times, but that's it.

Matt Damon and Jodie Foster star in this and do a respectable job at what they are given to work with, but in the end I found this to be entertaining to an extent, but overall one big mess of ridiculousness.",1470614400,9,2141,4.634920634920635

How to describe the magnitude of suckery herein? Well, at some point in the future, the earth is overpopulated, polluted and dirty. All the brown people live on earth, with the exception of Matt Damn, who is apparently the only poor white man left on the entire planet. All the white people (with the exception of one Indian guy) live on Elysium, a spaceship of eternal life and utter perfection that orbits icky old earth. Oh, and apparently in this version of the future, they don't print instructions for birth control in Spanish.

All the white people (and the one Indian guy) have access to Elysium's amenities, which include a machine that can cure anything that's wrong with you. Naturally, cause all the white people (and the token Indian guy) are completely racist, they keep all the white man mojo to themselves on their orbiting spaceship. The brown people on earth, naturally, want all the stuff the white guys (and the Indian) have on the spaceship. Everyone on Elysium is rich; the token Indian guy is to let you know that this isn't really about race (it is), but about the One Percenters, so it's a class war (where 99.9 percent of the Elysians are white.)

The end of the movie has hordes of people flocking to get free stuff, or, in other words, it looks like any given day on the US border with Mexico.

Fully 2/3rds of the movie is like a video game. There's more love dedicated to the CGI than to any human element, which makes sense, since there are no relationships, just cliches. Matt Damon is OK. I'm still trying to figure out what Jodie Foster is supposed to have been. I know parts get a bit scarce when you're a woman past 50 in Hollywood, but I'd always given Foster a lot more credit for choosing her roles wisely. She apparently was drunk when she signed this contract.

Everyone else lives on what is left of Earth.  But what is that exactly? You never get a feel for what Earth is like or what it looks like beyond a generic set that you just think was filmed ina desert location.  How did this all come to be? What is the Global Political ramifications? Is just the US because most everyone that you do see on Elysium (The Space Station) looks American.  The movie doesn't bother with details or ask you to think beyond a simple premise.  Instead, you see a muscular Matt Damon (because even in the remains of a ruined Earth there must still be a Gold's Gym and people have time in their quest for survival to work out) getting strapped with guns to go up there and kick some ass.

5912710,2,B00EHK2S04,"It's about a guy who suffers a terrible workplace accident, and is thoroughly unhappy with the medical care afforded by his Bronze plan.  Essentially, they give him a bottle of pills to tide him over until he dies (no word on what kind of co-pay he had to cough up).  This shoddy treatment is made worse by the fact that he can literally see a big star-like spaceship up in the sky that is full of people with Platinum plans, which includes access to these little pod like things that can cure anything in about 10 seconds.  The temptation is too great:  he has to sneak into that spaceship and get a taste of the Platinum plan lifestyle.  Fortunately, he knows a guy who can help make that happen (you didn't think he was just going to start a Go Fund Me campaign, did you?)

In most regards, this film is boring in the sense that it follows all the standard Hollywood conventions.  If you are surprised to learn that there is a romantic subplot, a creepy villain who just can't seem to stay dead, and a big fight sequence at the climax in which everyone turns out to be master kung fu practitioners, well, then you probably haven't seen too many movies.  And if that's true, hey, maybe this will seem fresh to you.  To me, it didn't.  It's an action film with a subplot about wealth inequality -- most especially the differences in health care quality entailed in that inequality.

Some things that stood out:

1.  The year is 2154, and people are still driving GMCs from the 1980s.  I don't ever want to hear anyone question the durability of GM products ever again.

2.  In LA, half the population is speaking Spanish!  Imagine such a strange turn of events.  Breathtaking, really.

3.  Jodie Foster talks throughout the whole film in this weird kind of voice.  I can't place it.  It sounds kind of haughty (if that's the word).  Maybe it's meant to be an accent of some sort, but it seemed like the sort of thing a good director would have talked her out of.

4.  Speaking of accents, I honestly couldn't understand half of what the villain was saying.  Sometimes, I suspect that was a good thing.  Other times, I got the impression that an important plot revelation had occurred.  In retrospect, I think you can track the storyline just fine by following the explosions.

5.  It's 2154, and many important things haven't changed dramatically aside from the fact that cops are robots now.  Climate change?  Nothing noticeable.  Peak oil?  Nah, still plenty to go around.  Minor fluctuations in fashion choices amongst people in general?  No thanks.

6.  The people in control of Elysium are so incredibly incompetent, I'm shocked they held onto their little resort for as long as they did.  I mean, as an example, the defense grid seems to consist of some dirty malcontent firing missiles from the balcony of his studio apartment.  A) how is that not a lease violation?  and B) they really don't have any kind of automated system?  Nothing ""in-house"" to take care of things?  What if that guy calls in sick?

It goes on like this.  I like the idea of dealing with important social issues like wealth inequality through the medium of science fiction.  That's what good science fiction should do.  The problem is that the film doesn't have much to say other than ""Hey, wouldn't it be nice if everyone had a Platinum health care plan that cured all ailments in seconds?""  Yeah, it sure would.  But the solution seems to function quite a lot like those special medical pods that cure everything in seconds:  simplistic and all too easy.",1449705600,6,3537,4.589743589743589

5912730,3,B00EHK2S04,"I'd heard the world building in this movie was pretty good. I was almost certain I had seen it - saw too many similarly gritty movies with indistinct titles at round the same time, but when I heard a description of the plot I knew for certain I hadn't seen it.

Let's say the world building is good, and we buy the initial premise, this is what the plot would be: Technology for magic cure-all beds exists, but only outside planet people can afford it... What would happen is that the blueprints would be stolen, sold in the black market, Chinese knock offs would be distributed around the world and used for on-worlders who could most afford it. This is easily a plot that could be made into a movie that allows for intrigue, excitement, explosions, etc. It would also be completely believable and consistent with reality.

What we get instead is a man who has been exposed to so much radiation that he will die in five days and is only able to function because of some really strong drugs he is given. Somehow he survives and recovers from major surgery that adds an exoskeleton that turns him into an invincible cyborg. This cyber-superman now gets stabbed in the gut with a gigantic sword, but is able to afterward fight his way out of the planet, take over a space station and provides free healthcare for the whole of the Earth. All the while time is running out, his organs are melting, and yet he manages to do this with minutes to spare.

The whole thing is an extremely transparent allegory for Mexican illegal aliens infiltrating the US to get access to free health care. The people on Earth speak East L.A. Spanish (duh!) and the space dwellers speak English and French (Ooh la la!)

I kept waiting for someone to hack off Jodie Foster's arm, and was disappointed when no one did.

If one can buy the absurd plot details, this is a OK action if derivative movie (Metropolis, Blade Runner, etc.)... ...But it could actually have been a good SF movie.",1447632000,2,1961,4.528248587570621

These poor devils just want to get up there where they can find work and good health care, all those things the nasties are keeping from them.  Give me a break Hollywood ""stars"" with your millions!  Damon runs around being a ""spokesperson"" for all these wonderful organizations he and his cronies, like Clooney et al, keep raving about and he tells you to keep your kids in those wonderful public schools and then won't even send his to the schools in Brentwood, a real poverty-stricken area, mmmmm, sends them off to expensive private schools.

Here is the plot.  White people make their own wonderful world and how dare they not share it with the rest of the population that has overpopulated and polluted the Earth.  I mean come on!  We all know Matt Damon, his buddy Ben and Jodie Foster actively let poor people into their homes, let them eat their food and supply them with healthcare, why can't this small, white community support the entire world?!  On top of that, Whitie has magical machines from Asgard that insta-heal all ailments without cost or resources, just a wave of the arm and all is healed!  But of course, the evil Whitie isn't sharing!  How dare they!

So to get back at the evil white man, a Hispanic Damon (that is right, liberal holier than thou Hollywood casts a whiter than white Boston (the racist city in the US) man as a Hispanic) to pick up a gun (you know, those things Hollywood liberals want banned) and kill the evil white man to get what the white man has (wait, is this liberal or conservative propaganda movie?).

Sadly that is the stupidity of this movie.  The knuckle dragger that wrote and directed this movie couldn't even get his own liberal propaganda right.  The only message here was Dear minorities, go ahead and kill white people and take what they have because since they aren't sharing, somehow the problems you are in is their fault.

- Matt Damon
- I saw it on TV & didn't have to buy it!

What I didn't like:
- Matt Damon (because if he wasn't in this movie I wouldn't have watched it).
- Jodie Foster's very plastic, horrible performance.  Could her accent BE any worse?
- The recycling of the music from Gladiator
- Strange assumption that all white people are rich and evil and all poor people are ""those"" immigrants.  I'm not buying into that stupid narrative.

I like mindless fun movies.  This was just the former with non of the latter.  Check out the amount of positives to negatives and you will see that my criticism is in the majority, not the minority.

It is so far beyond any other similar thoughts of what a space station can be. And it would work if you could get all the pieces in place. Centrifugal force would hold the atmosphere in along with the people and buildings and water. It is the only feasible way to make a ""gravity"" to hold things in place. The only other sci fi classics that I am aware of that do this are 2001 a Space Odyssey and  ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"".

Beyond that the basic concept of the wealthy having no feeling for the rest of humanity. Turn your head and walk away. Phil Collins sang it best, ""Oh Think twice. It's another day for you and me in paradise."" I am not saying you should throw it away. I am saying you should think about others and how best to those who don't have a little more.

In this case.. you have Matt Damon toting a FN SCAR 16s. Look closely how it is set up. If he shot that gun with the charging handle along the left side of the barrel, he would rip his thumb off. SCAR 16s and 17s have a reciprocating charging handle.. one that goes back and forth with each shot, like an AK47. You do NOT want your thumb in the line of travel of that charging handle.

The sad part is that the SCAR is very easy to flip from left to right, just undue the handle, and put it on the other.. can be under 30 seconds even while drinking a beverage. so there is no excuse.

This film has a heavy liberal bias, and I say that as a liberal myself. If you are strongly conservative and unable to separate your politics from your film-going experience, then this may not be your kind of film. If you could watch Avatar and still sympathize with the protagonists I think you'll be okay, but this issue strikes closer to home for some.

5912817,1,B00EHK2S04,"A thinly veiled, childishly simplistic and ultimately dangerous expos on economic class-distinction, citizenship and universal health care. If only the United States, ah, I mean Elysium, would open up its borders (and space shuttles) to share her infinite abundance and infinite medical technology, then the whole world could be saved! 
Sounds nice, especially to a child. But America does not have infinite resources.  Certainly not enough to provide subsidized heath care to the nearly seven billion of Earth who could, of course, greatly benefit by what American has greatly toiled to achieve and of which there is not enough to go all the way around the Third World (or America of Elysiums sci-fi future)

Elysium avoided the real world difficult decisions as to whom of the Earths inhabitants get to be citizens, preferring the gross oversimplification of those uncaring, unfeeling, selfish upper-middle class white gated communities that are, once again, withholding their infinite medical technology and infinite resources.

The production team would rather us approve of their revolution than to instruct the inhabitants of the Earth how to build a better world.
The production team chose rather to construct a world where the surface inhabitants were held back, held down, mistreated and unable to do much of anything. Thought the underclass did find ample time to graffiti everything, tattoo themselves to the extreme and avoid any form of sanitation , hygiene or laundry.

Elysium also ignored the reality of the international aid, medical and otherwise, that the United States has actually donated over the years. It is never enough, but it has been and continues to be significant. The oversimplification and demonization of characters is, of course, a literary technique to guide the viewer into agreeing with the writers and producers political and social beliefs:  those living in squalor (the good guys) are in a (Marxist) class struggle with those living in luxury (the bad guys).

Now, the special effects, on the other hand,  are really cool s - wouldnt it be great to have that kind of airline travel?! But the writers probably believe that airfare should be free and universal as well.

Elysium gets one star because everyone gets a star, right?
Elysium along with District Nine should be enough to convince all viewers not to expose themselves to anything else this team produces.

The acting is really quite good, the effects are fantastic, and the story is coherent as well as plausible and elicits a strong sense of sympathy for the protagonist.

Matt Damon's character has no depth and it tis the best character in the film.  At best he is a thug that is bullied into a typical 1800's workplace accident.  Even after that event his motivation is pale at best.  Matt Damon does a decent job of portraying the emotion and depth that the  character needs but the script, directing, and editing fail him completely.  Jodie Foster, who is marvelous, cannot resurect the sad role that she is in.  Her character has absolutely no rational for acting in the manner she does, even in her death.

This movie should be shown at film schools for a reiview of how to mess things up.

5912862,1,B00EHK2S04,"So, let me get this straight. Matt Damon's character, Max, first has his arm broken in half by a baton wielding android in the LA police department. Then, he becomes irradiated in the factory where he works manufacturing the same androids used for the oppression of the people on Earth. After the accident, an android nurse/OSHA representative who also works in the factory informs Max that he has five days to live, since his vital organs are slowly turning into a liquefied mush from the deadly radiation exposure, and gives him a bottle of pills to alleviate the pain. Since he's dying anyway, he decides to allow a gang of car thieves to surgically attach a super-powered exoskeleton to his body with a drill and some nuts and bolts from the Home Depot. Of course, they perform the surgery in an unsterilized workshop, and secure the exoskeleton to his body by drilling the bolts directly into his skull and spinal column. After he recovers from the surgery, he decides to get into a fight with a south african/ nazi mercenary by the name of Kruger, who runs a sword through the middle of Max's solar plexus, where afterwards he is able to stumble away. Then, miraculously, he reaches Elysium, where he gets into another protracted fight scene with his nemesis, Kruger, who he manages to toss over a balcony to his death, by yanking a tether from his own body, even though Kruger has a superior militarized exoskeleton attached to his body. All the while, Max is in excruciating pain, since he is still dying from the radiation poisoning, and the software program disrupting his brainwaves. Finally, he dies after he activates the program embedded in his brain, in the hope that his techy friend can reboot the altered program to register every resident on Earth as an Elysium citizen. That way, the poor underclass citizentry on Earth can gain access to the medical pods on Elysium that can do everything from curing cancer to performing facial reconstruction in one fell swoop. That pretty much sums it up in a nutshell. Apparently, the writer of the script hasn't researched the prediction of trends in the future demographics of populations, whereby Caucasians will either be non-existent or assimilated into other races through miscegenation by the year 2035, according to the experts.",1436140800,,2294,4.884615384615385

If you know nothing about war, technology, human nature or reality in general, it could be entertaining. But for me it just kept getting worse and worse.

Which can be fun but when you are again trying to be taken seriously and make import social commentary it seams... odd and misplaced. If they make this a mindless rump of Sci-Fi and action with over the top villains and mythical like heroes placed in a Sci-Fi Space heaven then.. frak yeah I am in. However instead it never seamed to be successful at getting the action up to that level.

I would say more but... no spoilers.",1433721600,,946,4.338983050847458

5912891,4,B00EHK2S04,"Before going on, I had had many reviews and thoughts on this movie. The most resounding criticisms I heard was that this movie was not as good as District 9, and that it was big on action, but small on social commentary. Personally, I did not see it in these terms. As far as I was concerned, the movie had plenty to offer in the way of social commentary, it was just that it was rather heavy-handed and obvious about it.

All throughout the movie, much is made about the divisions between those who live in orbit and those who live Earthside. The fact that people below will risk life and limb to get to Elysium, and that Secretary Rhobes is willing to kill to keep them from doing so, is also demonstrated without a lick of subtlety. And just about everything else, from titles (Homeland Security), settings, anecdotes, and use of language (English, French, Spanish), serve to underline this.

The issue here isn't that the movie lacks in social commentary, its that Blomkamp chose to spell it out for the audience. This is not to say that the commentary isn't effective  though obvious, the points raised are valid and need to be made. Immigration, health care, privilege, and the distribution of technology based on wealth; all of these are relevant concerns are likely to get even more so as climate change becomes more of a problem.

And since this last bit was a central part of the plot, it was certainly not lost on me. And the action was good. Real good. Like action-porn good! Between the exoskeletons, futuristic guns, drones, aerospace vehicles, guided missiles, explosive devices, cybernetics, and fistycuffs, Blompkamp once again demonstrated his ability to make sci-fi geeks croon and drool!

And then there were the visuals, which were also very compelling and breathtaking. Between the extensive, sprawling slums of Earth (clearly inspired by the shantytowns of Johannesburg), Elysiums beautifully rendered rotating frame and artificial atmosphere, and the robots, souped up cars, and spaceships of this movie, everything looked pretty damn cool and kick-ass!

It was just too bad Neill didn't let the scenery and plot tell the story and felt the need to repeatedly tell the audience what it was all about. Overall, I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10. Most of that is awarded for action, effects and visuals. but its still an 8!",1433635200,3,2349,4.830845771144278
5912892,5,B00EHK2S04,"Very nice movie, I love the ideas that Neil Blomkamp print on his movies, very polemic but so true, about the physical product, on the inside it looks the image of Kruger with the exosuit on the left side and on the right side was placed the disk with the image of Matt on backwards with his exosuit.

The only bad thing, is I buy this as a gift for my family in Guatemala, and if you don't have an IP registered in Elysium ...sorry in US, the digital copy is wasted.",1433548800,,467,4.076086956521739

5912900,2,B00EHK2S04,"I love the genre, and Matt Damon is a very good actor. Dystopia literally means ""not-good place."" Place a hero there (or in this case one who is in process of becoming a better person), and vulnerable people who need help and protection, and there is the potential for a gripping tale that bolsters its audience against the dystopian elements they face daily in their worlds.
  I love the genre so much that I used it in a short story I wrote in my collection.
  In the case of ""Elysium,"" the film comes far short of its potential.
  The elements that eroded its potential were the following:
* Frequent use of the f-word, and that by the hero and his associates (how can I recommend it to anyone with this in it? did more harm that good)
* The director's and screenwriter's failure to make a connection with the audience regarding the human and lyrical aspects of the story (because of primitive and ineffective techniques such as overemotional flashbacks)
*  The hero's terrible sickness from radiation disappears entirely; I know he had pills, but still, with a few days left to live, and considering how sick he was at first, there was a disconnect for me here
  There was some cool stuff. The setting was awesome. I know you have to move stuff along in a film, but the ruins of Southern California seemed like they could have been explored a bit more.
  The point of the story is a guy who puts others' benefit ahead of his own, and the nobility of that trait in his character is something we see develop during the story. But this great theme is clumsily presented and easily lost because of that ineffective presentation.
  Just kind of disappointing. I really liked those Bourne movies, and for me they set the bar pretty high.",1432944000,,1735,4.558064516129032

5912913,5,B00EHK2S04,"I really enjoy Matt Damon's characters. They have a sincerity & shine to them transcending the movie itself. In this, he is an inadvertent hero - and sometimes we all wonder about our reaction to be a hero if we only knew what we'd have to experience for it. The story is on a huge scale - the hero's journey from the micro to the macro, enlarging our scope of vision as well. Tho I tire of the enemy-who-will-not-die scenario, often our nightmares revisit until they are beheaded, so it is just a matter of how they are dealt with, after all.
I believe that there are discoveries taking place which will exactly replicate the ending here - healing will be provided for society as well as for all medical needs once the current exchange of money-for-health is beheaded...
I thought Jodi Foster played an excellent character as the uber Security Chief. Tho her vision seemed grandiose, it was too limited to bring her victory over the long term. Much larger events needed to occur, and since she could not enlarge her scope to take this in, she was summarily removed.
Bottom line, if we don't take care of each other on a global level, we will not continue to exist. Service to others is not just a byline - it's a way of life that defines the quality of life for us all.",1432512000,,1270,4.431623931623932
5912914,1,B00EHK2S04,"This movie is actively bad. I don't fall asleep at movies, I have a hard time sleeping in a car or plane (to the point of never being able to do it) This movie put me to sleep twice on two occasions. The plot holes are so large you could drive a space station through them, the characters are all unrealistic caricatures with murky motivations (if the writer/director (same guy) even bothered to try to define a motivation).

Sometimes when the writer/director are the same person the movie can be excellent, but when its bad, its really, really, really bad. This is the latter.  The movie is incredibly nonsensically preachy as well. So the space station has a fleet of shuttles full of nothing but magical healthcare beds that aren't used to help anyone on Earth because....???? The space station people are all evil capitalists who know the best way to make money is invent a magical healthcare bed and then park it in a garage and let no one pay to use it? Billions of desperate customers, who want the magical healthcare beds so badly they risk their lives to fly into outer space, down on Earth isn't a market they interested in serving, they would pay literally every dollar they had for access to a magic bed, which can cure anything in a couple minutes of you laying on it so a whole community could share 1, and instead the villains of the film just want to keep them unused in their garage? That isn't evil, that is just stupid. It is almost like he took his inspiration from Marvin the Martian ""I want to destroy the earth."" ""Why?"" ""I want to destroy the earth.""

Early on in the film Matt Damon gets radiation poisoning that indicates he will die in precisely 5 days, he is also given magic pills that make him have no symptoms so he can function at 100% physical capacity for 5 days. This is just an example of the lazy ridiculous writing that permeates the entire film. What a convenient plot device huh?

And honestly? The action isn't even any good, don't watch this for the scifi action, even that is subpar in my opinion. I can think of no redeeming feature at all that should inspire anyone to watch this film.",1432512000,,2130,4.467866323907455

Even M Night had two great films before he bit the dust. Nothing in this film is worth watching but the special effects. And I'm sad to say I just don't care.

But I really watch it for Sharlto Copley (Kruger), he is such a great actor and brings such a unique feel to his characters. The theme of the movie is great, especially when you don't take the message as a personal attack to whatever your current political beliefs may be. The gap between the havs and have nots is an issue that has been around as long as civilization has, even who has access to better doctors and health care. This is not just modern day problem but one that will be with us for a long time yet, but regardless stories like this should be made and the theme just brings it closer to home, maybe helping you identify with the characters.

5913035,4,B00EHK2S04,"Ok. So you know from the outset that this is another have/have-not dystopian future re-imagining much beloved of science fiction since its inception; Eloi and Morlocks, Alphas and Epsilons and all the rest. Its an old and much reworked theme for a very good reason, highlighting the injustice in the inevitable divide between rich and poor.

In this instance, the haves live on a lovely shiny space station while the rest of humanity struggle on in grinding poverty deprived of welfare and the advanced medical care that the haves take for granted. So, nothing new there then. Given the subject matter, it is absolutely bound to be stuffed with clich&eacute;s (and it is) but it really doesnt matter that its an old story and you more-or-less know whats going to happen from the outset. Its the treatment of the subject that is the essence of the movie.

As with director Blomkamps excellent District 9, the atmosphere is elegantly, though perhaps a little heavy-handedly managed, claustrophobic & personal and the CGI is absolutely seamless making for a thoroughly immersive and plausible view of the future. Some of the accents are a bit heavy; Kruger the caricature baddie South African and Spider the Latino techie are almost incomprehensible at times while Jodie Fosters accent wanders about all over the place. Matt Damon muscles his way through it with his usual aplomb, perfectly cast as the down-trodden ex-con action anti-hero with nothing to lose and although the rest of the characters are a bit one dimensional this somehow enhances rather than detracts from the overall feel of the movie.

While not startlingly original or deeply plotted, this film is well constructed, plausible (wellsort of), highly watchable , engrossing and doesnt pretend to be anything other than what it is. A simple movie on an ancient theme and fine addition to our massive science fiction collection, definitely worth several viewings.",1421539200,,1927,5.091772151898734

5913038,4,B00EHK2S04,"Neill Blomkamps Elysium doesnt travel far from the hot, brown, and oppressive tenement slums of South Africa found in his great District 9 film.  That environment has largely been transferred to the hell-on-earth culture of the scritch scratch rabble of humanity left on the dirty blue globe amongst which we found the films protagonist Max (played by Matt Damon), an ex-hood trying to keep his head down and work his way out of the slums without getting busted again.  The problem is that the filthy rich industrialists who provide for his work could give two shoots about him or anyone else; hes just a piece of meat to them and he gets treated as such at the factory and endures a lethal dose of radiation when his supervisor demanded he take care of a mess without following the safety protocols.  There are certainly comments here about work conditions and politics that the general masses of humanity suffer under.  This world is not too far off removed from ours.

But where our rich and elite live in mansions and penthouses they still come out and touch the street.  In Elysium they don't have to because the privileged live on a rotating bio-sphere orbiting earth and have no want or remedy for the people down below.  In this fantasy of the future illness and devastating disease and genetic malfunctions can be easily overcome with the pass of a magic medical machine.  As you can imagine it is the poors goal to get a ticket to Elysium, that place afforded for mortals to tread amidst the gods.  For Max and a long lost loves little girl its literally do or die and he gets involved again in some of the dark dealings of the underground gangs and gets fitted with an exo-skeleton that gives him incredible strength, endurance, and general physical enhancements.  It also keeps him alive long enough to make a go at it but hes no longer doing this just for himself but for his youthful girlfriends dying daughter.  Damon does a great job playing Max with the same intensity, grit, and even sympathy that he has displayed during his time playing Jason Bourne.  If you're a fan of Damon then this movie will do nothing to dim your enthusiasm of him.  But IMO the real star here is psychotic Kruger (played with menacing delight by Sharlto Copley).  Krugers character is simple: hes a hired gun.  But hes good at what he does not just because of the enhancements that he enjoys but for his personal enjoyment of his work; the mans a monster.  He and his wicked crew give everyone they run into a fright and hes a great match for Max as he brings out the best of Max in his bid for survival.  Max stays one step ahead of Kruger, but just barely.  So this cat-and-mouse interplay works nicely and their ultimate fight is satisfying.

Ultimately what makes this gritty dystopian sci-fi movie worthwhile are the actors (an all-around fine cast who do a great job and keep the film compelling).  The critiques of the film toward our current world politics are obvious and not as playful (and sometimes subtle) as what was found in District 9 but the two films share a lot of the same ground between them.  Blomkamp exposes a distrust of the future as he draws on the past and shows that advancement is built on the backs of the lowly beasts of burden who, in the end, are no better off (and often worse) for their effort and toil.  Nevermind that Elysium, in his tale, actually exists.",1421193600,,3389,4.576158940397351

I loved the ringworld imagery of Elysium. Reminded me of Halo and the Niven books. Awesome to see that on screen in detail. But that was the end of the cool factor for this unbelievably stupid movie.

I could name a dozen problems with the plot but I'll focus on the biggest one: CEO John Carlyle (played by William Fichtner) dies of blood loss due to a bullet. Meanwhile, Kruger (played by Sharlto Copley) gets his face blown off, and the Elysium medical machine rebuilds his brain and face in about 2 seconds and brings him back to life. What's up with that?

I couldn't get past that gaping hole in the plot--bigger than the hole in Kruger's head. Ruined the film for me.

5913063,4,B00EHK2S04,"This movie has a lot going for it. At the top of the list is having Matt Damon playing the lead. Just as in most of his movies, he comes across as the unexpected action hero, with his teen aged looking face and less than Schwarzenegger-like dimensions. Jody Foster was also playing against type as a villain, but she gets relatively little screen time, and her sub-plot does not get the attention it deserves. I am a big fan of detailed back-stories, but this film gives us no clue to how the Elysium station came about. When I first heard the premise of the film, I expected that the Elysium engineering would be similar to that of Larry Niven's novel, ""Ringworld"", but it isn't. It's much less ambitious. It's an old story of the downtrodden wanting something the wealthy have, and they do not, and the audience will immediately sympathize that this thing is something the poor deserve to have.
The special effects are ""up to standard"", but not eye-popping. Neill Blomkamp, the director, demonstrated that he could make a truely innovative Sci-Fi movie with routine special effects. The problem with ""Elysium"" is that it does not have the ""big, surprising idea"" of ""District 9"" It is possible I enjoyed this movie more for having seen it before I saw ""District 9"", since I did not know how good the director could be.
As a classic Sci Fi action thriller, it's no Star Wars, but it is far better than Transformers.",1419724800,4,1415,4.6414342629482075

Sharlto Copley has a totally ""jump the shark"" scene just before the end of the film when he (for no reason whatsoever) leaps 40' in the air over Matt Damon.  It is the most gratuitously ridiculous scene in the film, and there are several.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" should not be mentioned in the same sentence as this film, trust me.  I saw it when it came out, 43 years ago.  I remember Anthony Burgess (the author of ""A Clockwork Orange"") being interviewed by Johnny Carson on ""The Tonight Show"" and Burgess said he was ""obsessed with words"".

Many seem campy by todays standards but at the time they were socially way ahead of their time.  This movie takes aim at the debate over social and economic inequality showing us a world where these issues have grown to the state of worst case scenario.

5913090,1,B00EHK2S04,"*sigh* How? How is it possible? That Matt Damon and his posse of Hollywood's haters-of-capitalism cannot see the utter, searing hypocrisy posed by their very lives? I suppose it's simple human nature to be blind to one's own blindness. But this is so far beyond mere hypocrisy, that it's a new as-yet-unnamed class of arrogance and cynicism. It's just a huge ""FU"" to the middle class for Matt Damon of all people to lecture us on anything. But that doesn't stop him. Ohhhhh no.

This is a leftist fairy tale, full of answers that magically appear when The Rich are made to pay, usually by dying a violent death. To Matt Damon the answer to everything is, ""It's the fault of The Rich"". (I do get a kick out of it when self-righteous scolds don't even pretend to be bothered by their own hypocrisy when talking about ""The Rich"", like it's someone other than themselves.)  The movie is full of the very same cardboard capitalist villains and noble working-class heroes which any Soviet film director would have recognized. It even features an innocent child who has been sentenced to die by The Selfish Rich only because she is not a citizen. Get it? Get it?!?!! Because if you don't, Matt's gonna hammer it in your head time and time again, just to make sure. He has a sermon for every liberal make-believe talking point, from selfish capitalism, to fake wars, to fascist patriotism to ""immigration"". Oh, and the most evil bad guy is.....wait for it....a white South African racist who wants to be an oppressor-rapist of strong, free women of color! But of course. Simple Matt's answer to society's ills? Why, Open Borders and Magic Eternal Life Health Insurance for everyone! Hooray! And of course not a word about where the resources come from to make this happen. It just does. Magically. Because ""fairness"". It is simply beyond parody. It's a cartoon within a fantasy inside a fairy tale wrapped up in lies.

It's so depressing, because it's so simplistic and blind to reality. But it reflects Hollywood's maniacally out-of-step mindset. It's mildly interesting to see some ideas about future weapons, but that's about it in this movie. Otherwise it's just as oppressive and deadening to the soul as watching a propaganda film commissioned by Lenin for recruitment purposes. And why would anyone want to finance that by buying or renting this movie?",1417478400,2,2351,4.828784119106699

5913129,1,B00EHK2S04,"Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in terms of logic and acting.  It suffers from the same problem as many scifi movies - uneven technological development.  In a world of  force fields, self-replicating nano-tech and 3d building the notion of money is moot.  The Earth could be transformed for free.  It's just so absurd.  We have robots, AI, miraculous biotech....and everyone lives in a garbage dump and judging from the movie, apparently never eats.  And we are to believe the key to the whole thing resides in someone's head? Gimme a break!

The ""acting"" was really bad unless screaming like a banshee is considered artistic.  Poor Jody Foster spoke in a constantly-slipping weird accent and looked old, bored, confused and hard.  Her job apparently consists of giving orders, watching view screens and pushing buttons.  The ""Citizens"" looked like souped-up versions of Stepford wives and male models.  Not one was memorable, even the major players.  Of course there were lots of plain, old-fashioned fights and I mean LOTS.

Damon has fallen into the trap of becoming the character he plays in the ludicrous footsteps of Sally Fields, Sissy Spasek, Leo de Caprio and others who talks as sociology experts simply because they played the part of a poor, homeless, hungry, etc person.  Damon didn't do a lot but cuss, fight, run around wildly and look longinly in the distance at times.

It is not gory, gross and shocking like District 9, but the paradise of Elysium has one snake in the grass, Jodie Foster, and some very desperate people trying to save their own lives and those they care about.
Sharlto Copley returns after District 9, (as WIkus) to play Kruger, a psychotic mercenary type for some great action sequences. His accent is almost incomprehensible at times, and laced with Africaans, though it is supposed to be Los Angeles.  You will also get a lot of Spanish from Matt Damon's character Max and his friends, and French from Jodie Foster and her wealthy cronies.
Matt Damon is great as Max, the anti-hero with nothing to lose and everything to gain if his gamble to get to Elysium pays off. The settings by the legendary Syd Mead just add to the amazingness of this film. The special effects from Peter Jackson's Weta Workshops are great as always.

I just could not get past that fact that in the movie that only in the space station are there machines to heal people.  Really???

What is comes down to me is that even if you accept the premise of the film, the plot is lacking, Matt Damon was not the best action hero and Jodi Foster's performance was the only redeeming quality to this film.  Even then she was a tad overboard in her portrayal of her character. I blame the director for their vision of how each character Not Damon or Foster.",1412726400,4,712,4.338345864661654

5913171,5,B00EHK2S04,"The central focus of Neil Blomkamp's ""Elysium"" - the idea of a gated and walled habitat exclusively for the elite - is a fairly common theme in science fiction; and particularly reminiscent of George A. Romero's ""Land of the Dead,"" to name just one film.  But it's Jonathan Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"" that casts the archetype of an elite city in the sky; Laputa (The Whore) serves as the ultimate policing mechanism of those below by functioning as a giant cloud cover that can move from place to place to block out the sun and ruin the crops of anyone who disobeys its edicts.  Though the satellite city of Elysium is too far removed to physically affect anything on earth, it nevertheless manages to control almost every aspect of earthly existence.  It employs an army of robots to police earth; uses whatever terrestrial manpower it needs for its commercial enterprises; and, most egregiously, denies a health care system almost akin to immortality to the people of earth.

There are elements of Paul Verheuven's ""Robocop"" - even of Star Trek's ""The Borg"" - as Max (Matt Damon) allows himself to be hard-wired with some of the robotic parts the company he works for manufactures.  This he does to try and save his own life, after being exposed to a lethal dose of radiation; as well as the life of his childhood sweetheart's daughter.  His robotic exo-skeleton, besides giving him the strength to carry out his mission even as the radiation is slowly killing him, assists him when he comes up against Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopath employed as an undercover agent working for Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) on earth.  Kruger discovers a way to make Elysium his private kingdom by retrieving all the data Max had extracted from an industrialist via a mind patch - all of which has been set in motion by Secretary Delacourt's obsession with maintaining Elysium's absolute security.

The movie starts off slow, with numerous flashbacks to Max's childhood, and builds to its climax as Max slowly evolves from a man simply trying to survive in an almost impossible world to a rebel determined to change the scope of that world.  Max's first encounter with Kruger sets in motion a chain of non-stop action which takes them both from earth to Elysium, leading to Max's final encounter with a robotic clad Kruger. The action, as noted, is virtually non-stop once it finally begins; the effects, as expected, are superior; the writing, direction and acting are excellent for this kind of story.

A number of reviewers see a political agenda where there is only the inevitable conflict between ""haves"" and ""have-nots.""  And, incredibly, some reviewers even see ""Elysium"" as some kind of endorsement of ""Obamacare"" - as if the idea of providing health care to everyone sprang full-blown from the mind of one politician.  Beyond that rather simplistic view, it absolutely boggles the mind to think there are those who would resent making health care available to everyone; it may be an impossibility but it's certainly not an evil plot.  Imagining you can insulate yourself from the rest of the world and hoard your health care ceased being even remotely possible in the Middle Ages when the Plague found its way to Europe and wiped out a third of the population.  Being exposed to other cultures is the price of commerce, whether it's on Elysium or in the real world.  Exploiting resources and human labor inevitably invites unexpected and unwanted consequences against which there is, as ""Elysium"" demonstrates, no defense.",1412035200,,3530,4.949238578680203

5913186,5,B00EHK2S04,"I totally enjoyed Elysium (Two Disc Combo).  In the future Earth simply is left to go straight to hell.  Today we have a wealth gap brought on by a wage gap.  Today more and more the big cities are magnets for the extremely rich who are slowly displacing the urban poor.  There are the 1% who own most of the wealth.  There is the professional class that populate the top 15% of the wealth pyramid and  finally there is the 85% who are considered lesser quality folk. Today we have a working class that is slowing becoming a new underclass.

The movie Elysium suggests what will happen if the trends segmenting society based on rich and worthy versus poor and unworthy were allowed to continue unchallenged. Elysium is a gigantic space station sort of like a dyson sphere without the sphere and thr man made star at the center.  Earth has become of waste both ecologically and in the form of human debris, the low wage workers, homeless, drug addicts, bums and other humanoid flotsum are religated to the fetterd and festering sewer Earth has been allowed to become.

Race does not divide this world Money defines who the haves and have nots are.  Poor people of all races live on a poluted nasty Earth ripe with garbage.  The healthcare care infrastructure for the poor is vile to the extreme, overworked and filthy/  For the post elite of Elysium health care is advanced to a level that would make Star Trek med bay seem primative.  If you have enough money you too can live in a posh space born estate on Elysium where people have real champaigne dreams every minute of the day.

The poor toil under conditions of wage slavery like those found in the inner city ghettos today.  In Elysium it is not just poor black and  brown people who number among the poor even if we are well represented.  Elysium unmasks the real agenda of the rich ruling\ owning classes.  The middle class is effectively eliminated in Elysium.  The poor of all races suffer together in a hell hold Earth where there is no pocket of beauty or joy let anywhere.  People are reduced to acting like animals.  the most base and vulgar aspects of the human animal has come the new normal.  Elysium is what Star Trek's cloud city of Stratos warned us about so many years ago in the old series.

The production values for Elysium were the best.  the sets were extremely believable.  The technology was appropriate and seemed realistic. The sound was good.  The video quality was awesome. The special effects were grand but did not take over the story. There was plenty of action and the story did not get in your face preachy.  The very happy ending was logical but their was no sense of irony where we got a chance to appreciate what was lost.  The ending was a bit too Obamacare socialist for my taste but that did not take away from the joy I had watching Elysium unfold.  I would have liked the ending more had it been more of a question mark, asking the audience now that we have the chance how would you solve the problems so carefully shared in Elysium.  The questions asked by Elysium are being born around us in todays economy today.  In todays world the rich are getting so much richer and the middle class is slowly dying away.  It won't be long before Elysium will be reality, the only difference the cities will be shining clusters of wealth and the hinderlands will be festering sewers of poverty.  Elysium asks potent questions of its viewers, I wish the tory tellers had put the audience on the hook to start thinking about real answers.",1410739200,2,3521,4.5293185419968305

A work-place accident though pushes him into drastic action to gain access to the medical marvels enjoyed by the orbiting elite.

So, a few ideas are explored, the vastly different experiences of the `haves' and the `have-nots' which reflect the planetary situation at its worst, also the lengths to which some will go to preserve the status quo (limiting immigration anyone?). There's a sprinkling of standard SciFi tropes too: robotics, the curing of all disease and colonization of space. It's Hollywood, so it's all done with heaps of conflict and explosions and frankly, there's not much to write home about - or in this context, to commend in a review. I found the swearing to be overdone and the South African accents of the `bad' guys, painful, features that overwhelmed the few positives.

5913268,2,B00EHK2S04,"Matt Damon rose to stardom by playing a genius. But he's more of an idiot - as least in terms of career management.

Damon is not tall - but he's not ridiculously short like some other Hollywood action stars. He not particularly handsome as movie stars go - but he's perfectly acceptable. He seems, like Stallone, to be a talented scriptwriter and that's how he got his first big break. He's a decent actor - unlike his buddy Ben Affleck. He's an everyman not a glamor man. In the Ocean's eleven-through-thirteen series he's distinctly less glittering than the main leads.

His second big break was the Bourne series. That surprised me. The books were terrible but the movies were much, much better. Any number of young movie stars could have gotten that part but they didn't - Damon did. He was well cast. Sean Connery was always ridiculous cast as an undercover spy. Everyone would remember that tall and incredibly handsome guy. Damon could actually not be noticed on a public street. He's much more average.

So what's my point? Damon is being replaced by Jeremy Renner - an even more average guy. He's shorter and less handsome than Damon. But I like him better - mostly because I don't know anything about his politics. When I see on the screen I am not distracted by what I know of him in real life.

But with Damon I am confronted with memories of all his public posturing on political issues. Damon politically doesn't have anything original to say. He doesn't seem all that bright. He is merely trading on his fame - and it's costing him.

Damon's high political profile is particularly obtrusive in this hard left political movie. The plot is a loony left wing fantasy.  The main issues in the future seem to be the same issues that the left thinks are important in Obama's second term. The main theme is income distribution. Somehow the rich people are all living happy in orbit while they have oppressed most people so that they have to live in earthbound squalor.

Why would they do this? Every society on earth strives to enrich the poor but for some reason in the future that's all reversed and the orbiteers enjoy making everyone else poor. The other question is why don't the people of earth just create some wealth for themselves? The Earth in this movie looks like a huge horizon to horizon South American slum. Where is Hong Kong, or Abu Dhabi?  Before the opening credits it is explained that overpopulation is a problem. If so why don't they trim the population?  They have a lot of advanced technology but that idea has never occurred to them.

The technology in the movie is annoying. They keep showing normal chemical rockets flying in one stage into orbit. They even have shoulder fired missiles that break free of the Earth's gravity and reach orbit in seconds. Maybe when Obama killed NASA the people forgot what real space technology was like.

The people on the earth in this film are like the people in the Matrix underground cave - scruffy and dirty. They all look like they need a bath but they seem to be able to run a major high tech operation with no problems. This is apparently a new meme. The bad guys wear suits and are clean while the good guys are the filthy homeless.

The other big political issue in the film is Obamacare. That is to say, government sponsored health care. The bad clean guys who live in luxury want to restrict medical services to the orbiters (Republicans) and let the Earthbound die lingering deaths in pain and misery. The message seems to be everyone could be happy and healthy except that the Republicans don't want that to be so.

It's all very heavy handed.",1404864000,,3627,4.604651162790698

These rich, elitist snobs are represented by the lily-white Delacourt (Jodie Foster), whose French-sounding name and haughty attitude tells you everything you need to know, and the space station's Indian president (Farah Tahir). The downtrodden on Earth appear to be almost entirely Hispanic, with the occasional criminal white man (Matt Damon). Got the picture so far? A bunch of Hollywood millionaires, who actually live in a contemporary Elysium, are lecturing you on immigration and income inequality.

In the year 2154 the very wealthy live on a man-made space station while the rest of the overpopulated Earth resides on a ruined planet. A desperate ex-con (Matt Damon) takes on a mission that could bring equality to the polarized worlds.

What did I think?

Its grim and gritty. Impressive visually and with interesting characters. Its themes are universally relevant (have/have-nots, sustainability, and asylum seekers). And the action is wonderfully brutal. But the longer the movie wears on, the more it becomes formulaic unfortunately. Its still a very good flick and one of the better ones of the year but you're left feeling that it didn't quite reach the mark of greatness despite its strengths.

Its the year 2154 and everyone on Earth is living in poverty. I didn't see any middle class people in the movie. Everyone looked dirty and desperate to get on the space station called Elysium. That is where all the rich people live, up there. ""They"" have their healing machines and all of their fancy technology. The people on earth might as well be back in the 1800's by the way they lived. What was that they put on Damon? They hooked it up to his brain and central nervous system.

It seems that in this far away land, elite speaks French and their homeland security leader is unscrupulous offical played by icey Jodie Foster.

Damon play Max, petty thief on parole who works in the company that produces robots for Elysium citizens.  Max is in situation where he must make his way to Elysium because for him personally it is a matter of life and death to find a cure for deadly disease.

5913293,2,B00EHK2S04,"District 9 was great, different; it took an actual political issue (apartheid) and twisted it into a compelling, allegorical scifi. Small budget, big effects, cool aliens, terrific acting. Lots of action. You would think the writer/director of District 9, given a chance at Hollywood resources, would blow you away. Well, he didn't. Instead, he gave us a propaganda film for the 99%. But I knew that going in and figured I'd still have a good time watching it. I didn't. I was bored. The movie is slow, action starved, and not very logical. Even the premise is a stretch -- the wealthy elite live in a ringworld-esque space station visible from Los Angeles with the naked eye. This space station would be the envy of anyone in the Star Trek or even Star Wars universes. And they have these Medical Bays that apparently can cure any sickness or disease. These bays look like tanning booths, and you can see the person in them while they're being worked on, which only takes a few seconds. These machines can even reconstruct a blown-apart face through a process we're given to assume is called re-atomization. Pretty impressive, huh? And it's all going to be available in 2154. Just 140 years from now. So that's the basis for the story: the uber rich, pretty people living in ringworld with their miracle health machine, and everyone else living in filth and poverty and sickness on the planet below. What happens is Matt Damon gets hit with a lethal dose of radiation, and his only salvation is to get into one of these machines. To do this, he must partner with, and do a favor for, a local gang leader geek warlord coyote type who seems to live above everyone else and who has a pretty good stock of high tech gadgets and weapons. The favor is that he needs to have Matt Damon download some programming from the head of Damon's old boss, a guy who owns and manages a robot factory where Damon used to work and where Damon got his lethal dose of radiation. This download is to be done after Damon surgically acquires some cyborg prosthetics. Two subplots complicate or compound this A-story. The first involves an old girlfriend of Damon's who (of course, can you say plot device?) has a sick child with Leukemia, and the second has to do with Jodi Foster's character plotting to overthrow the ringworld administrators. Btw, Jodi Foster speaks with the most bizarre accent in this movie. It's actually quite jarring.

So, what's wrong with the picture? Let's count the ways. WARNING: Some Spoilers Follow

1. Damon works in this factory. It looks like a cross between a UPS shipping facility and a junk yard. The only clean place in the whole factory is where the boss stands and looks at computer screens. So, why are they irradiating robot parts? I assume it's to decontaminate them. But then why would you decontaminate them and then roll them back onto the same factory floor they came from?

2. The local warlord geek gang leader coyote has lots of resources. He has sophisticated weaponry, cyborg prostheses, lots of electronic stuff. He even has access to shuttles. Yeah, space shuttles. So why doesn't he have one of the Medical Bays? Wouldn't they be sort of a hot item on the black market?

3. Why build an enormous space station in low earth orbit? Why not just buy Chile and live there? Why would a space station be safe? If you consider the direction space engineering is taking today, you see private enterprise and also smaller countries getting into the act. In 150 years, almost anyone will be able to shoot a rocket into space. A low Earth orbit space station visible with the naked eye from Los Angeles would be like hanging a water balloon on a tree limb at Camp BB Gun.

4. If you need to shoot down unauthorized shuttles trying to enter your space station, why do it with some guy on the ground using a bunch of shoulder fired missiles? Why wouldn't a space station with a 1500 mile diameter have its own sophisticated defense system? You mean to tell me, the defense of a multi-gazillion dollar space habitat depends on a single guy who lives in a rathole and doesn't own a decent pair of clothes?

5. This is a future world in which intelligent robots serve as cops and a process knows as re-atomization can fix any known human disease or injury, where a space station has been built that looks like a modern version of Rome. Re-atomization! Think about it. Scientists have figured out a way to create things at the atomic level. If you can re-atomize a human face and head in seconds, how long will it take to make a hot dog? And why are people starving and living in filth on the planet?

This movie would make Gene Roddenberry roll over in his grave.

Here's what I think happened: The director failed to assert himself when the talking heads in Hollywood took control of the story and said to him: ""Don't worry. It's a movie. We don't need to be logical. Just tell the story.""

The far distant future presents the usual Hollywood movie scenario of mother Earth finally becoming to grips with being trashed by the so called undesirables, and the rich and prosperous have vacated the planet by creating an outer space luxury home dwelling in a place they call Elysium. Meanwhile a commercial worker seeks the healing treatments of Elysium from planet Earth having been subjected to radiation exposure and has less than a week to live and will do anything to get it. In the course, he has been embeded with some unusual wiring to help him accomplish a mission that will take him there, and has even inherited data files that enalbe the ability to convert and overide citizenship for the impovershed people of planet Earth.
His mission to save himself, however, eventually fails but not until he can translate the files that initiate citizenship of his home planet. The movie ends on this high note looking at retrospect of why nuns hailed him as a special person as a young child.
My only concern is what the movie doesn't show, the future condition of Elysium when the new citizens have taken over. I don't think the place will ever be the same with clothes hanging over walls and bannisters, yard sales, low rider vehicles, and new corner taco shacks!",1401753600,3,1291,4.716814159292035

Well, I won't expound ad infinitum upon the many plot holes this movie has, just pick any of the 1-star reviews here and they will elaborate better than I can. All I can say is - this is no 'District 9'. Neil Blomkamp must have been on drugs when he wrote this because only a coked-out, self-absorbed moron would find these plot devices believable.

They must have given him carte blanche after the genius of District 9, but boy, was that a mistake. Somebody (other than Neil) should have been screening dailies, because the unfeasibility of the plot points stack up fast and furious. I watched to the end only to see if it redeemed itself, but, to my surprise, the ridiculousness only got worse. Neil B should be suspended from making any movies for 5 years as penance for subjecting the audience to such drivel.

2 things not mentioned much elsewhere (so many things to pick on), but:
>> the sound editing was pitiful (could not hear half the dialogue
>> Jodi Foster's 'accent' was laughable (almost worth watching to make fun of it)

There are those who say that the story is unrealistic.  Well again, it's Sci-Fi.  There are those who say there are things in the movie that are not believable.  Well, you guessed it - it's Sci-Fi.

There are a whole bunch of people who seem to hate this movie just because.  Critics and complainers actually put me off seeing Elysium on the big screen so I rented it on Blu-ray.  As a SCI-FI fan, I found Elysium quite interesting and highly entertaining.  Jodie Foster is good as always and Matt Damon does what he does best.  I have always liked William Fichtner playing the arrogant SOB.

Of course Elysium is cheesy, but don't forget that dark and cool themes have churned out their fair share of rubbish movies and games too.  Only nobody wants to slate those ""Masterpieces"" and ""Art"" because they don't want to appear unintelligent, uncool etc or unhip (If there is such a word).

So the wealthy people build an orbiting 'gated community' named Elysium, and remove themselves to it.

Ultimately, Matt Damon's character, demonstrates that healthcare should not be available only to those that can afford it, thereby presumably increasing the population of a planet that is ALREADY overcrowded and where living in squalor and paucity of resources is the norm.

5913346,1,B00EHK2S04,"There's not much good I can say about this movie. I was aware of the theme before I watched it: the rich control everything, and they intentionally keep the poor in a state of poverty in order to preserve their luxurious lifestyle. ""Elysium"" has the same theme as the ""In Time"" movie. Neither movie adequately explains why the rich need to keep the poor down in order for them to stay rich. But, at least ""In Time"" was enjoyable to watch. ""Elysium"" was a train wreck.

SPOILER ALERT BELOW:

The characters are so stupid and shallow, that I can't even remember a single character's name just 10 minutes after watching the movie.

The rich can cure all diseases or injuries with their magical healing machines. For some unknown reason, the rich won't let the poor use them. They live in an orbiting space station, and keep themselves isolated from the poor.

Jodi Foster's character (military enforcement leader for the rich) loves to kill the poor. She's a driven, motivated, determined, ruthless killer. But, her boss, the president of the rich, and the rest of some sort of council, all object to Foster's behavior, which I guess she's been warned about for a long time. It seems that the president and the council are sympathetic to the poor that Foster is killing. Yet, they've never removed her from her post? (Um, I don't get it.) And, they don't allow the poor to get healed from fatal diseases, even though it costs them absolutely nothing to heal them?? We're supposed to believe the president and council care about the poor, but they do virtually nothing about Jodi Foster constantly killing the poor?? It makes no sense.

Then, at the end, when the maniac bad guy stabs Jodi Foster in the neck (despite that Jodi Foster has been his ONLY supporter, so I don't understand why he wants to hurt/kill her in the first place), Jodi Foster's character suddenly freezes, and doesn't ask for help. She should be running to get into one of the magical medical beds that can cure her. But, nope, she just lays there, and willingly denies help, just letting herself die for no possible reason. So much for the strong and determined character she had all through the rest of the movie.

Matt Damon's character, as well as the rest of hopelessly oppressed ""good guys"" in this movie, are convicted criminals, car thieves, or just plain unemployed people with no desire whatsoever to be employed. At least in the ""In Time"" movie, with the unbelievable plot where the rich needlessly suppress the poor, the ""good guys"" were hard working, honest, self-sacrificing people who were just struggling to make a living in a hopelessly oppressed situation. But, in this ""Elysium"" movie, Matt Damon is a big time car thief, and his other oppressed friends are all either unemployed (and don't want to be employed), or are fellow car thieves and various other types of criminals. But, the movie tries to portray Damon as a guy who is on the road to redemption... yet, at one point in the movie, he walks out on the little girl suffering from leukemia, refusing to help her, and doesn't even shed a tear.

Meanwhile, the main rich guy who actually provides work for the poor, is the hardest working and most important rich guy in the movie, who leaves the orbiting sanctuary and goes down to the surface of Earth... somehow they've written him as a bad guy who doesn't mind seeing his own workers getting killed.

I just can't understand these backwardly-written characters with massively inconsistent personality traits that just don't make any sense. Almost none of the characters behave in any way like you'd expect. There isn't a single ""good"" rich person. But, there really aren't very many ""good"" poor people either. None of the characters are even likable. You don't feel any kind of connection to Matt Damon's character. You don't care if he succeeds or not in his quest to get to Elysium to save his own life, and the lives of others. You don't care about any of the people helping him.

None of these characters are written in any sort of way consistent with their supposed personalities. Even the South African serial killer (that Jodi Foster hires to do her dirty work) isn't written consistently with his personality. He's supposed to be a cold-blooded, hardened, experienced, and trained killer who has seen endless blood and death. But, then, when he gets injured himself, and he is 100% healed by the magical healing machines, somehow he loses all control, cries a river of unhappiness that nobody explains why (he just got healed 100%, and has zero problems, so why is he crying?), and then goes berserk, killing Jodi Foster (his only supporter) for no apparent reason, and goes on a blood hunt for Matt Damon. I just don't understand it. This guy should have been the most ""clear"" character in this movie, the hardened emotionless killer who isn't phased by anything. But, nope, for no good reason, his character turns into a weak crybaby and goes berserk.

Every time they try to give any of these characters any ""depth"" - they have the characters do things that are completely illogical and nonsensical, totally contradictory to their supposed personalities. But, this isn't ""depth"" - this is just stupid. And, the entire premise (of why the rich need to suppress the poor) is never really explained. The whole movie is just a train wreck of stupidity. I mean, it's one thing to have character development in movies... arcs where a character evolves (or devolves) due to the circumstances and plot line. That's good stuff, and makes the movie better. And, plot twists and surprises are fun in movies too. But, in ""Elysium"" this isn't what's happening. There's no real reason for good guys to be good, or bad guys to be bad, or for the massive random departures from their own personalities that almost everyone takes in this movie. Imagine if, for comparison, in the middle of a scene half way through the first ""Star Wars"" movie, Ben Kenobi surprisingly departed from his character, and suddenly whipped out his lightsaber and cut Luke Skywalker in half for no possible reason. Like, um, what? That's about how I felt watching Elysium. With the exception of the main idea that Matt Damon was trying to save his own life by getting to the space station to use a magical medical machine, other than that, I had no idea why people were doing what they were doing. And, it seemed that almost every other character was written completely backward, and kept doing things that were completely opposite of whatever their personalities were supposed to be. These weren't fun plotline twists, nor were they great character development, they were just plain stupid.

A bunch of people might say that I'm too harsh, and that this isn't supposed to be a ""good"" movie about character development. But, then, what is this movie supposed to be? People say it's an action movie. But, there's not all that much action. And, when there is action, they use that jerky camera action that blurs what's going on. Plus, by today's standards, the action is pretty weak. Having Matt Damon wear a couple of hydraulic things on his arms doesn't really turn this guy into a Transformer or Iron Soldier.

Other people might say that this movie isn't about action, nor about character development, but it's about the rich oppressing the poor. Well, ok, that's in there. But, they don't really explain WHY the rich are oppressing the poor. And, the whole ""Robin Hood"" concept is completely backward when the ""poor"" that are being oppressed are people who are nothing but criminals and/or people who don't even want to work. None of these ""poor"" people from this movie make you want to see them succeed.

Other people might say that this is a movie about redemption. Matt Damon's character used to be a car thief, but now he wants to work his way up and be a better person. But, he gives advice to others to tell them how to best steal cars, he walks out on a little girl with Leukemia without wanting to help her, he puts his friends at risk with him in his quest to get to the medical bed to save his own life (most of whom die as a result), and overall, I can't think of a single ""redeeming"" thing he does for the first 99% of the movie. At the end, he sacrifices himself so that the other poor people can all have access to the medical machines. But, by that time, it's too late to actually care about his character. (The codes stored in Matt Damon's brain that will unlock the medical machines will cause him to die if he unlocks them.) Believe me, you're not going to shed a tear for him, because it's a completely hollow and silly plotline bandage that the writers stuck into it because they couldn't think of a better way for Matt Damon to sacrifice himself. And, by that point, Damon's character still hadn't done a single redeeming thing that made you even want to see him live, despite the lame efforts by the writers to patch in some silly dramatic backstory about Damon somehow serving a higher purpose in life since he was a child.

Anyway, if it's an action movie, it fails because it lacks good action. If it's a dramatic movie about character development, it fails because you don't care about the characters. If it's a story about redemption, it fails because there's nothing you care about to redeem. If it's a story about the rich oppressing the poor, it fails because nobody ever established why the rich were not sharing the medical machines in the first place. Basically, this movie fails on every level.",1398643200,8,9499,4.70414912808178

5913350,3,B00EHK2S04,"It's true that this movie was not all that it could have been. The first act and the end are quite good. But the very long second act all but falls apart completely.  You just want to take all the brilliant footage they shoot and re edit it into something truly meaningful .

My guess is most people who hated this film gave up on this movie around one hour in, when it seemed like the story had run its course and the dialogue is beyond terrible. But for those who stuck it out to the end it was a good payoff. However, I don't blame those who gave up. Between Jodie Foster's mystery accent coupled with her horrendous acting, and the wooden two-dimensional dialogue and plotline, It was torture to sit through the second hour of this movie.

However, to the many negative reviewers who said that this movie was Hollywood shoving ""a liberal agenda down your throat,"" movie I have to say, I have no idea what they are talking about.

Most dystopian science-fiction films have some form of ""liberal agenda"" in that the evil rich people are generally abusing the poor, or the environment, or something. I suppose one could stay that Star Wars suffers from this same syndrome, as does Hunger Games, Clockwork Orange and 100s of others going back to Orwell's 1984.

In the future of this movie clearly the ACA has been abolished as well as the entire profit motive for the medical industry. In Alysium's future we have cures for all kinds of cancers but we keep them only for the super rich because aparently the rich will have done away with insurance companies. Therefore the poor, which make up the entire working-class of gardeners, cabdrivers, babysitters, cleaning people, teachers, etc., etc. all suffer and die at a very young age and at a very rapid rate.

How in the world does this support ANY political agenda?

I give it three stars for its stunning visual effects and production design. However, except for the special effects team and the art director I think everybody else who worked on it just saw this movie as a quick payday.",1398470400,2,2041,4.59065934065934

5913352,4,B00EHK2S04,"I'm going to forewarn people expecting a deep and intriguiging plot, you are NOT going to get that in this movie!

Without giving away any plot points, I'm going to say this was definitely an interesting Sci-Fi/Action movie, directed by the same guy who did 'District 9'. This definitely isn't his best movie but it's good for what it is.
While the plot isn't exactly the strongest, it definitely tried to be as original as possible, but still copied the same basic components of a drama movie.
The special effects in the movie were fairly good, not on par to Oblivion, but still a pleasure to look at.
The acting is really carried by Matt Damon, while not at his greatest in this picture, still did a great job of carrying the picture (there's also the one 'comic relief' hispanic guy). Sadly, Jodie Foster's acting just wasn't that great in this movie, I don't know whether it was her trying to be up tight, or just her accent, but it rubbed me the wrong way.

Overall this movie gets a 3.75/5 for me, mainly because of the action, Matt Damon (and a few other actors), the visuals, sound effects, and some of the plot was decent. It's definitely worth checking out, and I honestly liked it despite what the critics and other users are saying.

5913355,3,B00EHK2S04,"The visual effects are the best part of the film.  The plot is single-threaded and unmotivated, and the acting disjointed.

Although it's obvious why disabled, sick, and injured people want to get at the almost magically powerful, fast, and cheap healthcare --not just treatment, but almost instantaneous healing-- available  to the wealthy out on the Elysium space colony, it was never made clear why the Elysians refused to provide it, since when they're finally forced to it's obvious that there are no shortages involved --the system immediately sends down some huge number of shuttles each with what appears to be 20 or more of the near-magical med-beds.

Also not buying Matt Damon as a native Spanish speaker.  Jodie Foster does a great job as she always does and she plays a Villain which is awesome since she almost always plays the hero.  Plus in real life I guarantee she supports amnesty and yet she is as convincing as she ever is.

The action is good.  A little stupid, overblown characters and ridiculous plot twists, but it wouldn't be a Hollywood movie if it didn't run like a superhero cartoon.

Maybe on our world if we could fix every health problem in 10 minutes with a machine in our homes, they wouldn't have to make movies like this to further a political agenda.  Now THAT would be wonderful, way better than this movie.",1397174400,3,991,4.4636871508379885
5913374,3,B00EHK2S04,"Another reviewer described this film as good, poor, people of color (led by Matt Damon - only because he is a box office draw) vs rich, evil whites. To me it was enough, having Jody Foster, especially Jody Foster, in the role of the villain for me to see something different. To me, in a way this film is about men vs women. This is a mindless, brute force is everything, action adventure movie selling the idea to the fairer sex that this (awesomely cool) violence is sometimes necessary. . . ?

As with Neill Blomkamp's previous film, District 9, I'm unsure how I feel about Elysium. District 9 was a very impressively put together film but personally I didn't like it much. This film is not as good and I'm not sure I like it's message. It's taken as a given these types of things are going to have a 'mainstream' bent. In the incredible 'Matrix' film (which admittedly brings up the 'blue pill' and 'the red pill') the bad character is named 'Reagan'; in the recent comedy film I watched, 'The Dictator', at least twice they discuss the 'great dictators of the world' and list 'Chaney' as one of them. We discriminate against conservatives (at least 'none of them make movies') and we give ourselves awards for it? Here the 'message' contained in the film is only over done when we learn the security for Elysium is named 'Homeland Security'? The film may have possibly worked better with no space station at all? Having recently watched an old Star Trek episode 'The Cloud Miners', I noticed the world presented in that episode has similarities to Elysium.

There are some problems in the film, beginning with a mercenary firing a surface to air missile all the way into space Towards the space station he's trying to protect (possibly as a way to introduce Sharlto Copley [who also played in District 9] into the film. There may be too many separate characters in Elysium. Or they are poorly integrated into the film.

Another review of Elysium claims that the best science fiction makes you think about the present. This film could almost be horrific in that sense. Matt Damon is forced to build the robots that abuse him, as one example of how this film may hit close to home. Like the film District 9, the main character, in this case Matt Damon's character, is stricken by a deadly illness. When you're going to die, nothing else matters. Perhaps these illnesses simply provide a way for the director to get down and dirty with the action and motivations? Sharlto Copley, who played in 'District 9' plays a mercenary who gets fired by the rulers of Elysium. The film shows him moping around in his off duty hours, throwing stuff around, maybe kicking a can out of his tent. Thinking back on this, after the film was over, this behavior is similar to that of the alien 'Prawns' in that previous movie? For whatever reason, that filmed showed aliens who were base and degraded, if not more primitive than we are. Perhaps this was an alien ship full of mercenaries!

'Homeland Security' aside, I'm not sure the more overt messages contained in the film are over done. Whether you believe in 'Global Warming' and think ill of those who deny it, or whether, not even for a nano-second of time in the past 30 years have you considered 'Global Warming' a possibility (looking no farther than the messenger), the messages contained in this film shouldn't be ignored. A friend of mine suggested this film highlights the dangers of over population. Whatever it is, this film does a better job showing us a possible future than any economic news report. While Elysium's pro violence (although perhaps this is simply pro working-class man) stance is definitely a negative, the rest of the film could be considered enlightening. There is the possibility, on some kind of beneath the surface level, this film promotes working-class men and their ideologies. If so, it is a film warning us of the dangers of over population while it's effect will be one of increasing the birth rate? Perhaps the film 'celebrates' these men (and the violence they'd like to do, or now like to do) because it aims to keep them working. Or perhaps the film intends for them to internalize violence.

In any case, ignore the vision show here at your own risk.",1397088000,,4234,4.670241286863271

Elysium could very well be humanities future and if you look at some of the hidden meanings and call outs during the film on your second or third watch you'll see the Director's not-so-subtle messaging.  For example, on the Robot Factory's owner, pause the movie and read the tattoo on the side of his cheek.  Look at the message on the side of Matt Damon's gun when he is storming Elysium.

Spoiler Alert

As Matt is killing himself to save humanity, the final message is that everyone who has been denied basic human rights by the elite are restored their rights as citizens (same rights as the elites, same laws as elites) instead of being the slaves the elites have created on the discarded planet Earth.  It's a pretty much in-your-face message and I'm surprised how many people missed it.

Oops...sorry..was channeling the better days of Saturday morning cartoons with the Superfriends.  All the rich have abandoned Earth due to its over population, pollution and the overrun of undesireables.  They have encased themselves in luxury via a space station that only citizens of Elysium can inhabit; basically, you have to buy your way into the country club to hob nob with the snobs.  The side plot is that all citizens of Elysium have access to a medical marvel which can heal any sickness; even fully reconstruct a man's face that had been blown off in an explosion.  Illegals (and it's funny they use this term since most of the illegals are of latin descent) try to get on board the station just to get the healing they need, if not for themselves, for their kids.  In between the lukewarm and predictable action scenes are bad instances of dialogue which is hard to distinguish from background noise, even with the volume turned up so loudly, my house shook.  Thick latin and an even thicker australian accent from two actors.  Do they not know they can take voice coaching to get rid of the accents?  At the end, the action was good, but that's about all I can say.  If you have time to waste, watch it and see for yourself.  I'm glad I didn't buy it, but got it from Netflix instead.

5913431,4,B00EHK2S04,"A very entertaining movie. As despicable a person as Matt Damon is, or to be more precise, as ignorant a person as Mr. Damon may be, he has been in some very superb movies. The first Bourne movie was excellent and the following two he was featured in were very good as well, especially the third. It was proven in the fourth outing that didn't feature Mr. Damon that others could play the role as well as the fourth outing starring an, in my opinion, a more skilled actor or at least one on par with Mr. Damon, that any decent and halfway fit person could play Bourne though I have to admit that of all the Bourne movies the first one was by far the best (and sold a lot of those crappy little currently BMW midget cars, the Mini Cooper.
Elysium is a high action content movie that has nothing to do with Bourne of course and I completely enjoyed it. It won't win any awards other than perhaps cash for its lead actor but it was entertaining as hell. So forget the ignorant and misguided politics of Matt Damon, time will prove that to be wrong as it already is and just enjoy the work he does. It is rare that Matt Damon picks a poor script and I have to admit he had provided me with a great deal of entertainment. It is just a shame that he tries to use his fame to attempt to further incredibly stupid politics. But would you listen to the political beliefs of a housepainter? No. So why would you listen to those of a possibly less skilled person, a mere Hollywood actor?",1395014400,,1476,4.219081272084805

I just felt like he tried a little too hard to make the anti-blockbuster blockbuster...if you get my drift.  Not a huge fan of the message in this film either.  Trying a little too hard to paint corporations as the devil and don't even get me started on this whole healthcare commentary.  I promise that on an overall, that is not something that made me deduct stars though.  The real problem is this movie could've used to have a lot more action.  I am all for character development etc., but I am starting to feel like maybe Neill needs to stick to just directing his movies and not worry so much about the writing.  I like his technical skill, but he is trying too hard in my opinion with his writing.  Also, Jodie Foster sucks in this movie.  Like completely.  Great effects, great surround sound, great picture quality etc.  I would still recommend this to anyone, but just don't go in thinking you will be seeing District 9 quality again here and you won't be as disappointed as me.",1394150400,,1130,4.485294117647059

Entertaining, Jodie Foster looks good, Matt Damon plays his role convincingly.  I am biased toward the US, as opposed to Elysium, I think we make earth better, we don't abandon it, and although we are strong, we are not the only Nation that can be a watchdog.

I think the ending where all the poor people in the world become ""citizens"" of the orbiting city of rich people wasn't that believable, but the sci-fy nature, great filming of space shots, etc. makes the film really cool.

Jodie Foster was an excellent bitch even though her part wasn't clearly defined. We aren't told why she is acting this way, why she is withholding medical care that is readily available, or why she is in authority. This isn't her best role. Most of the movie seemed like filler. There were teams of medical workers with dozens of those healing machines, just sitting around waiting for someone to say 'Go'.

5913502,1,B00EHK2S04,"Big big spoiler warning. You should thank me I'm saving you 2 hours of your life.

 If you have read the book Atlas Shrugged Elysium is pretty much the sequel to the book set 200 years later. Just imagine Galt's Gulch in space.

 Basically the big bad white people have had enough of being forced to work themselves to death to support the lazy who have overpopulated the earth and built a self sustaining* space station to live on. You can almost hear them throwing the keys to Earth saying ""Here - Take it! We're leaving!!!"" I have a hard time seeing people who just want to be left alone as the bad guys.

 This is a liberals worst nightmare. No one left to tax. Society goes downhill from there. The cities are dirty, decayed and the technology has not appreciably progressed. It is overpopulated and the supposed 'hero' is a thief who is on parole and works in a factory. He is ordered to go into a chamber where the robots are sealed with radiation to clear a jam that keeps the door from closing. Anyone with half a brain would wedge something in the door to keep it from closing while they are inside, of course the hero doesn't have half a brain and he gets locked inside and doused with radiation.

 You have the ex childhood sweetheart who has the obligatory sick child (Of course no father is in the picture or even mentioned) Since the medical technology on earth has not progressed since the white** people packed up and left so research isn't real big on a prior non producers list of fun things to do for a living when other peoples money isn't there anymore.

 Things that drained all sympathy for the supposed victims.
 They seem to be able to buy beer but still live In filth (Dude- a broom and windex is cheaper than beer and lasts longer)
 The poor think that it is completely acceptable to break into a 'rich' person's house and use their facilities Medical care in this case if it was small enough to steal you would bet they would take it and not feel one iota of guilt about it belonging to someone else.  Just because the 'rich' built it for themselves Damnit the poor deserve to have it just as much as the people who made it. Forget that ""Thou shalt not Steal', 'Thou Shalt not Covet' Things altogether.

 In Short save your time and watch back to back obamacare commercials for two hours and you get the same message. 'the unemployed poor need healthcare and the people who work all day need to work harder and do without to pay for it because the poor need to save their money for beer. If they try to leave because they are tired of paying for it hunt them down, break into their house and take their stuff.

 *The only ships (except for one) that seemed to be coming from earth are packed with people who have not been invited to the space station. So the space station is not being supplied from earth.
 ** Matt Damon and the hired gun bad guy are the token whites left on earth. 85% of the rest are Mexican and you see one or two blacks until the end where they get free health care for all then all you see is the blacks in the screen shot

The movie is incredibly heavy handed about socialized healthcare and wealth equality, but not in a meaningful way that actually helps move the discussion forward. It poorly portrays the wealthy class as though they would find some life saving medical advancements that essentially make healthcare cheaper and yet they withhold it from the poor. The logic behind the story didn't make any sense.

5913508,2,B00EHK2S04,"Matt Damon is the only reason this movie would be worth watching for FREE on Netflix or Amazon Prime.  He does an OK job with his acting.  All other acting is poor/half hearted.  The only reason why Damon and Joddie Foster did this flick is for the political statement.  However,  think the fundamental issue with this movie is that it's totally unbelievable.  Advanced cancer cured in 10 second by a scanner,  small ships launching and reaching an orbiting station in about a minute,  tiny missiles fired from a gun catching and taking out said ships in 20 seconds or so,  and more.  Note, I love Sci Fi, and I know you have to allow liberties in how reality is presented,  but this flick goes to far.

This movie also follows the general Hollywood theme these days...  Middle Class/Rich law abiding white people = Bad Guys.  Minority or Poor/Criminal whites = Good Guys.  If your into that,  then this movie might be a bit better.

Meanwhile back on Earth they make due with health care that is minimal in comparison and limited resources.  While you get the idea of how both halves live and the blatant disregard the rich have for the Earth dwelling population (Matt Damon's character is exposed to a massive dose of radiation and the owner remarks that if his skin is going to slough off get him off his medical table so as not to ruin the sheets), the movie lacks something.

On the one hand it was extremely anti-statist but on the other it suggested accountability should not lay with the masses.  It suggests that the rich are so because they oppress the weak.  It clearly says that healthcare should just be free for everyone implying that it has no cost and that the technology that drives it was created by a form of enslavement of the poor.  The movie then accentuates the evils of corporatism but totally misses that in reality those evils come from daily propaganda and a misinformed public.  Meanwhile, the actual communities in which people live are littered with trash.  Everything on earth is bad and nobody is asking why the people don't just take some pride in their own lives and show some personal accountability to make something good themselves.

The evil 1% live on the beautiful space station Elysium, where they have perfect health and eternal youth.  The 99% are stuck on earth, living in rubble, their only employment building robot policemen that like breaking people's arms for no reason.  The only hope for the sick of earth is a coyote who helps sneak people up to the space station to get Elysiumcare.  After Matt Damon gets irradiated, he decided to go to Elysium for the cure.  After a prolonged battle with a crazy bad guy with an Australian accent who manages to get rebuilt after half his head is blown off with a grenade and with the help of nice guy coyote, Matt Damon brings good health to the entire world and we all sing Kum Bai Ya.  Amusingly enough, while Matt Damon was on earth, it seems that all the dirty earth people living in rubble were either white or hispanic, but when Elysiumcare is brought to the masses at the end of the movie all of the recipients are black.

They spent all this time fitting Damon's character with this cool exoskeleton, but they did not exploit its athletic possibilities. If anything, Damon's character seemed more ponderous with it on.

I mean, this movie seems even less relevant in light of Damon's recent decision to educate his children in expensive and exclusive private schools, rather than the public schools he has repeatedly praised.  Seriously, who has joined Elysium now, Matt??",1392508800,12,684,5.256880733944954

The beginning of the film with Frey and Max was touching. So, for me if they had been the couple fighting for the life of their child, (a father desperate enough to save his child by any means possible), then this story definitely would have been a 5 star for me.

5913641,2,B00EHK2S04,"First the good.  Matt Damon is incapable of delivering a bad performance, and he holds true to form in Elysium.  That would be it for the good.

Now the not so good.  Jodie Foster is issued a handful of lines as the villain which she delivers in what I assume is a South African accent (since that is the setting of the film), and is otherwise wasted.  I hope she didn't negotiate keeping the wardrobe into her contract because I believe she spends the entire film in a simple grey business suit.

Now for the bad.  Nothing happens.  We don't care about Matt Damon's character, nor do we despise Foster's character.  Of course a sick child is thrown in the mix to up the emotion, but since that character is late to the film we don't really care about her either.  Being set in the future gives the director no constraints on tech, weapons, geography, vehicles, etc.  Taking full advantage, director Neill Blomkamp grabs bits and pieces of Mad Max, Johnny Mnemonic, Robocop, and I'm sure a few episodes of Star Trek and throws together an environment devoid of any innovation on his part.  Good guys are the cliche oppressed, genius, have-nots with hand made future tech and the obligatory limp.  Bad guys are clad in sleeveless future army garb with ammo belts and 5 o'clock shadows.

Notice all the good guys but one, is Mexican. I give it two stars for the graphics and cool vision of future medical innovations.

From immigration reform to universal healthcare, this film takes every opportunity to promote what I consider to be current extreme left wing ideals. As usual the ""haves"" and business people are the bad guys while ""the have nots"" are just dreaming about a chance for things to be ""fair."" In this world the wealthy have figured out how to fix any medical condition almost instantly (cancer, having your face blown in half by a grenade, ect.) but they despise the poor so much they refuse to share this technology...even though it is so readily available that everyone has it in their own home. They also refuse these ""illegal immigrants"" access to the space station Elysium to the point of blowing their ships out of the sky, killing women and crippled children. As of fan of science fiction and in particular movies related to possible dystopian futures I was excited by the premise of this flick. However the political message that the director, producer and or writer are so infatuated with was so over the top and extreme that it ruined a promising plot and distracted me the entire movie.

5913700,3,B00EHK2S04,"From the Writer/Director of District 9, comes Elysium, a futuristic tale that focuses on the inequality of wealth. Much like in his first film, Neill Blomkamp is examining a modern problem with a futuristic story, and once again, he isn't offering any solutions. As with District 9, Blomkamp is showing how an unsolved issue, left to it's own devices, will eventually cause chaos. In 2154, Earth is overpopulated and in ruins. The rich have built a utopian society on the largest space station ever conceived, and as you may have guessed, it's called Elysium. The story focuses on Max, an orphan and ex-con, who has always dreamed of living in paradise on Elysium. His plans to earn his way take a dramatic turn, when he is injured in an accident at work. Max knows he'll never survive on Earth and the only way to save his life is to get some of the advanced medical treatment available on Elysium. The two stories are very different, but the setting could have been exactly the same. The story itself was pretty good, there was a lot more action then in District 9, yet the similarities are unmistakable. Matt Damon stars and played the role he was asked to play. Max had a lot of potential to be an interesting character, perhaps one with an agenda, instead he was written as this dumb guy, who was anything but a savior to the people of Earth. Max was out to save himself and did what was necessary to survive, but he should have been more. The people all turned to Max to help solve a greater problem, but all he cared about was himself. Jodie Foster also stars, but has a surprisingly small role, that definitely did not fit her personality. Much like District 9 before it, the story of Elysium is used as a forum for the Writers agenda. The two stories are very different, but the technology, locations, and even several cast members are the same. The result is a slightly better movie than District 9, that will give you an eerie feeling of deja vu throughout.",1391644800,2,1968,4.546478873239437

It just seems that Jodi Foster, Matt Damon, and cast was helt back from delivering true performances. The two stars are for the few times the space station Elysium is shown up close. Why the back and forth between English and Spanish confused me thru the whole movie and i though i had my language settings messed up.

Not sure if they actually give you a tan too, though everyone who uses them is pretty tanned. The surface of Elysium looks an awful lot like Beverly Hills, where I assume the producers did most of their research. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.

Of course, the Evil Rich People, led by Jody Foster (in the worst performance of her career) try to stop Max and a bunch of other people who want to get to Elysium to get cured. This is a tract on illegal immigration thinly disguised as a sci-fi adventure.

I find it ironic that the Matt Damon character built the robots that helped enslave the people.  That's not significantly different than the THX character in THX1138.

As far as the disc is concerned, I was disappointed in the special features.  They are marginal at best, and there is no audio commentary to speak of.  This is sad because in the DVD hayday, the studios were all about cramming content.  Now, you pay more for a Blu-ray and get less content than you used to with DVD.

Since the beginning and endings were in Spanish with subtitles and the people on Elysium itself spoke French on occasion, that was a distraction. Those sections were muffled so the spoken words were unintelligible as if perhaps the filmmakers didn't want the audience to actually hear what was being spoken. Those viewing the movie with me spent a good deal of time raising and lowering the volume.  In the same way, the male villain of the piece had such a thick Cockney (?) accent, almost all of what he said couldn't be understood.

Folks on Earth living in squalor while the rich, as are their wont, frolic in a space station paradise called Elysium.  The habitat has machines which can cure any ill and those on Earth will do anything to get there and cure themselves and their love ones. When Max, ex-con and assembly line worker accidentally gets exposed to a terminal dose of radiation, getting to Elysium becomes his goal. After he discovers the daughter of his friend and fellow orphan also is dying, he swears to save the child, too. And thereby hangs the plot...Max's attempts with criminal friends to use a stolen computer program implanted in his head to sabotage Elysium so everyone will have access to it. Jodie Foster is great as the female villain--cold, calculating, practically emotionless--quite different from her other roles. She'll become the woman you'll love to hate and may even cheer when she gets hers.

As usual in SF, it's the special effects which star but in spite of that, the whole thing seems to lack something and I can't figure out what. Some other emotion than resentment, anger, and fear perhaps...a little ""human"" caring, a little more depth?  Perhaps more detail on the characters' lives?  Nevertheless if you look past that and just wants nearly two hours of explosions with a couple of spectacular space scenes here and there, you'll enjoy this film.",1391126400,,2148,4.836512261580381

5913753,3,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium has an IMdb 6.7 which is not shabby, It's worth seeing and has a lot of redeeming qualities. It is better than just ""okay"" and has more ""I like it"" moments than ""I don't like it"" moments but not enough to give it a general recommendation. If you liked District 9, you will probably like Elysium. If you thought Oblivion was 1,000% better than District 9, you should skip Elysium.

Some reviewers incorrectly criticize the acting. The acting is actually the most redeeming factor of Elysium. Matt Damon and Jodi Foster put in stellar performances as does the villain Kruger played by Sharlto Copley (""Wikus"" from District 9) who is clearly a super talented actor showing two great performances of very different characters.

Jodi Foster does a great job of being an elitist snob who speaks with an Elysium accent which is cleverly chosen to be based on French. This shows someone involved with the script is educated. Historically, French is the language of the elitist classes. Until relatively recently the English nobility including the Monarch spoke French at Court and among themselves to be aloof from the common people.

The problem with Elysium lies with the lack of character development, weak science fiction and excessive action sequences, not the acting.

The premise of the story is excellent as is the cast and production values. The elements of a great sci-fi drama/adventure film are all there but are not put together properly.

The Frey + Max romance is not developed at all. There is a notion of a childhood friendship but not a romantic relationship. Yet, the commitment required for someone to help as much as Frey did has to be either strong friendship bond or romantic. And then 3/4 into it, Frey turns into an opportunist -- not a friend or a lover.

Frey's demands for Max to take her daughter with him show she doesn't care about Max and just wants Max to heal her daughter (from some other relationship that is never explained). So the warm feelings for Frey get tossed out and her motivations for ever helping Max become suspect.

By the end, Frey is just a moocher preying on Max's determination to make it to Elysium to save his own life and her daughter's because she has thrust that burden on him. The attempt to have Max and the daughter connect with some shared story is an obvious, feeble attempt to save a fatally broken plot.

And Max is lethally dosed before we care much about whether he lives or dies. I mean at the time, we think heck, dying is better than that dead end abyss he's condemned to wallow in. He's living alone, doing nothing of consequence without any hope for anything to improve. Then suddenly, he's got to go ""back"" to Spider and offer to work for him ""again"". The previous relationship with Spider is all news to the audience and we don't know whether Spider is a good guy or bad guy -- he's a gangster of course but seems to be on Max's side.

And then, bang, bang, bang and everyone is on Elysium shooting at each other.

Too much time is spent trying to make an unrealistic and improperly established on-Elysium ad hoc fire fight into a meaningful climatic final battle between villain and hero. It falls flat because the villain and hero barely know who each other are and the vilain is unrealistically resurrected in a deus ex machina.

 And then Spider shows up tapping on keyboards all ready take over the entire Elysium complex because he has a code for a ""reboot"" that can make someone president!? I mean really, no one is going to question why there's a new president that they didn't elect? What? Spider pulls another deus ex machina and voila! everyone is a citizen with the same ""reboot"" code that was going to make Jodi Foster president. What? That's just silly.

5913757,3,B00EHK2S04,"This product arrived quickly and undamaged.

As for the movie itself, my wife and I feel it was good, but seemed to borrow a lot of concepts from existing material and lacked a strong story.  Ironically, we both predicted the correct outcome for every character very early in the movie (according to their individual introductions) which was kind of a disappointment in terms of suspense.  We like movies where you guess an outcome and then are blown away on just how wrong you were.  However, that is only our feelings and thus you might feel completely different.  Some of the acting in this film was great, othersnot so much.  We continuously were reminded of District 5 (which is understandable via who worked on this film) and Mad Max throughout the entire movie.  Sadly though, we feel Elysium (the ringed city itself) was just a mild twist to the Halos in the Halo video game series.  We love that series and noticed many background images held a more than familiar view from those found in the video games.  However, perhaps we are wrong and maybe Elysium was thought of prior to Halo or vice versa.  It was just odd that in Halo, there is a world on a ring (a halo) that floats in space, but in that case people avoided it to not destroy all species.  In Elysium, it is a world on a ring-like structure, but everyone want's to be on it to save the species.  In either case it is a good movie, but the plot was missing something for both of us.  However, this is just our view, and anyone without Halo playing knowledge might truly love the images presented.  Even if you do have Halo knowledge, the way the images are presented make you excited to know what a Halo movie could be like.

To sum this review up:
-Will we watch this movie again? Definitely.
-Was it enjoyable to watch? Yes.
-Did we feel for and/or relate to the characters? Sometimes.
-Did it have a strong and original plot? No.
-Were the outcomes predictable? To us, very predictable.
-Is it one of the best movies we've seen? No.

Instead of digging into the actual story they left it very simple, and easy to understand, and filled the rest of the movie with amazing graphics.

If you love graphics this is definitely a good film.  If you desire something deeper then keep moving because this lacks in depth.  And is really just another Sci-Fi Action hero flick with a lot of chases, things blowing up, and a few hand to hand fights.

5913813,3,B00EHK2S04,"Matt Damon is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a real stinker. It's as if Blomkamp had an idea and wrote it out in a weekend so he could pitch it to a studio before they forgot about ""District 9"".  The pace was slow until the last 1/4th when the action really picked up.  When Damon and Copley are fighting, I couldn't tell who was who, they both had those gizmos on.  Damon's supposed to be dying, but he looks pretty good, I guess he must have been taking his pills when we weren't looking.  I didn't recognize Copley with that beard at first, and it was interesting how he started speaking more like an Afrikaner in the last half of the movie.

There were too many unanswered questions-how did little Max wind up in the orphanage? Where was he living-was that supposed to be L.A.?  How come there weren't many black people around?  How can Elysium have a livable atmosphere when it's open to space? and do you really expect us to believe there is a magical med-bay that cures terminal disease in one or two minutes?  No wonder people wanted to breach Elysium-if the rich folks wanted to be sure the Great Unwashed would stay on Earth, they'd send down a few of those med-bays.  And wouldn't it have been simpler for the Spider guy to hack into Carlyle's computer instead of fitting Damon out like Robocop?

5913853,2,B00EHK2S04,"things I liked or thought were pretty strong story-wise:
(1) friendship between the Matt Damon character and his friend, the one who helped him get home after his industrial accident;
(2) the difference in medical care between the haves and have-less;
(3) I thought it was believable that the Matt Damon character was treated so poorly by his employer and I found it believable that he'd basically beg to keep his job and also work with a broken arm/wrist;
(4) found it believable that the Jodie Foster character would destroy two ships loaded with illegal citizens, though I found it unbelievable that she'd be reprimanded for it; and
(5) found very believable the huge military capability differences between the haves and the have nots.

story elements that were not as successful:
(1) the Matt Damon character received a lethal dose of radiation, was stabbed in the gut (and kept walking), survived a ship crash, a car crash, and engaged in multiple fist fights yet managed to keep on going until he basically laid down his sword. I know the writer tried to explain it with the surgery he underwent to make him stronger, but I wasn't persuaded. in my opinion, any one of the physical assaults he endured would've had him in bed for a month, if not longer. I just don't see how a person can get stabbed in the stomach and keep moving;
(2) the military complex, portrayed by the Jodie Foster character, the politician and the weapons contractor, were not believable as foes. my opinion, more believable that they'd work together (especially considering terrorism, and the fact that the world is getting to the end of it's affordable petroleum), along with banking and other major businesses, to control the country, and I believe are principally lead by the military. that is especially easier to see with domestic spying information increasingly reported. believe they work together and so to have them squabbling in the film wasn't believable;
(3) the Jodie Foster character, as the top security person in the country, I guess the secretary of war (is there such a thing?) would not rely on a mentally unstable mercenary, there'd be no need, she'd have the police and multiple levels of security agencies at her disposal and she'd use them. I believe the writer wrote the story this way for a neat and tidy ending, but just not believable that the head of the military would only have one go-to guy, a merc, and that she'd refuse medical attention once she was wounded. she'd already made a speech about protecting her children, etc.  No evidence that she was so disheartened that she'd basically take the opportunity of being attacked to kill herself. if the writer wanted that to fly, he should've given some evidence that she was depressed;
(4) also not believable that she'd allow her go-to guy to be fired. as she was planning a coup, very weak story-wise that she'd cut him loose, makes no sense. if she'd been forced to cut ties to him for political reasons, she'd have made sure to have a conversation with him to let him know she'd take care of him. her character needed alot more writing and needed to be thought through alot more;
(5) aside from the earth citizens having poor medical care and living in an unpleasant environment, no evidence that they had no access to potable water or food; nobody looked to be starving, which I didn't find believable. think it'd be much more likely that in a country with a crumbling infrastructure, water from a faucet wouldn't be forthcoming (as it was here), and neither would food. the old woman who helped the Matt Damon character had a cart load of pigs and she was a senior citizen, female, out by herself and unprotected. in a really desperate world, food would be gold and that woman's pigs would be stolen and if she protested, she'd be beaten or killed. not believable that she'd be out with her animals by herself w/out protection;
(6) unfortunately, human history presents many examples of the strong preying on the weak, but in this story the powerful leaders of Elysium were presented as essentially defensive, trying to keep the poor out of their territory. found this unbelievable. would've been much more believable had the powerful citizens of Elysium enslaved those on earth, not just sex slaves, but all types of other slavery as well. not the ordinary, rich Elysium citizens but some of the powerful Elysiums would've sought to tap the human resource potential of the earth citizens, say in the way England colonized India, or various European countries colonized various African countries, or the early American settlers took America from Native Americans, and of course, there are many, many other examples of predation other than the ones I've mentioned. As the more successful citizens with unlimited life (all disease cured), based on human history, some element of Elysium citizens would've sought domination of the earth people, rather than been merely defensive, as portrayed here. just not believable, based on history;
(7) just didn't like the story overall. the villains were too cardboardy, too one-dimensional and just not believable. they seemed basically insane and stereotypical. the hero was kicked around like a dog until he got so sick he was forced to become a criminal again. definitely the hero and the villains needed more work, to be thought through better. it would've helped if the Jodie Foster character made some sense and it would've helped to see her working effectively as a team member with political leaders and other leaders to control her world and earth. it would've helped to have the Matt Damon character with more relationships to help us see who he was. he had one guy friend, but he definitely needed more to flesh him out. would've been great to see citizens on Elysium, even just a family, to understand how that territory worked. ditto for a family on earth, especially on earth, to understand how the economy was run, if people paid their gas bills, had electricity, went to the grocery store, just a whole lot of practical/pragmatic information not provided about how citizens survived on Elysium and on earth and providing that information would've helped the story.
(8) more about story: Matt Damon's character sacrificed his life so those on earth could have first class health care and a first class life. he did this by hacking into the elysium computer system. obviously, elysium has computer programmers who will sooner rather than later, rewrite the program denying earth people their newly illegally acquired premium health care and status. elysium wasn't destroyed, the territory works the way it did when the story began. the Jodie Foster character will be replaced with a new secretary of war, the physical damage to esysium will be repaired and the earthlings new privileges revoked. earth hackers performed an act of war on elysium. compare it to hackers accessing the social security payment program and falsely paying out benefits to every person worldwide, whoever had a checking account would suddenly find they have an extra $5,000 in their account. well, obviously, social security would jump on that, and find a way to stop the hackers and get their money back. it would be expensive, but social security would do it. elysium would do it too.
(9) in the future, energy prices will skyrocket, pushing food, housing, transportation, the cost of everything to the stratosphere - Americans, and citizens of other first world countries, will protest - hence the reason in my opinion that governments like America and their security are laying the groundwork now for reducing human rights and enlarging their domestic spy programs, trampling on human rights, and worse. in that reality, world leaders, already struggling to provide care to aging populations with less money, are going to have real difficulty. as the most successful world governments have benefited from huge petroleum and other energy deposits and have largely not taken the opportunity to prioritize lifting their poor out of poverty but rather have largely served the wealthy and successful, who assist them into office with campaign contributions, it seems highly unlikely that when their leadership is really needed, that they'll suddenly find the will to prioritize their service to poor people. in my opinion, world governments already know about projected energy shortfalls and America, again in my opinion, is not preparing it's citizens for that shortfall, but instead is preparing it's military and security organizations and systems and amending it's laws to deal with protests. my take: the next 50 years will be grim for ordinary citizens in first world countries who find their take home pay won't cut it and who also find that ejecting political leaders won't accomplish a thing, because those same leaders are not the real rulers. elysium got abit right, i.e., crumbling infrastructure and the wealthier more successful citizenry choosing to separate themselves, partially for reasons of physical safety, from the masses. what elysium got wrong, was that it fails to ask/show why. if the writer had asked why, elysium could've gone into a whole new direction, a more believable and honest direction. crumbling infrastructure is due to lack of resources used to maintain them, like the buildings we see on earth in the film, decrepit and with walls missing. well that's not caused by evil humans, it's because cement is a very energy intensive building material and in a time when petroleum prices skyrocket, cement structures will be too expensive to repair, especially in residential housing, unless the owners/tenants can afford the repairs - and of course poor tenants won't be able to afford expensive repairs. the writer of elysium showed humans in dingy surroundings, many were dirty and obviously poor, but no one looked as if they'd missed a meal, or had no access to water, and that was a mistake in storytelling. a whole lot more people would be starving. food, water, and other essential resources, on earth and on elysium, would've been very interesting to focus on story-wise. how the haves and the have-nots dealt with less and more expensive food, water and the reduced ability to comfortably run their societies. based on what I'm seeing now and on what I've read of the past, those ruling the world have a tendency to enslave the weaker. elysium really didn't go there, and as I wrote earlier, one of the weaker points of the film were presenting elysium rulers as essentially defensive, just trying to keep the interlopers out.  doesn't ring true. military rulers/security are essentially proactive in nature, they'd see offense as a necessity, otherwise the masses of unhappy people would overrun them. so when the Jodie Foster character had the first two illegal shuttles destroyed, that was very believable; what was unbelievable was that she'd be reprimanded for it. earth people wouldn't be allowed to wander around doing their own thing, the rulers in elysium would control them, essentially enslave them, use them. health care wouldn't be denied earth people, it would be used to motivate them to do tasks for their elysium controllers. the writer of elsyium showed the desire for rich, successful people to separate themselves from the poor and the criminal, a behavior which has been ongoing for 10,000 years, made worse by racism, ignorance and the unwillingness of ourselves and our leaders to provide a basic social safety net for all people, despite our propaganda. this is a failure of our species, but not new. what the writer didn't show, perhaps because he can't see it, is what's coming: a step back into slavery for the majority of the world's population. military/security leaders are already laying the groundwork by significantly reducing human rights and protections, and greatly increasing the ability of the state to monitor citizens, on the pretext of fighting terrorism. that pretext works because terrorism does exist, which is why governments are able to play this card and not have citizens participating in massive protests. but the real reason this is being done in my opinion is because there is coming a time, soon, when cheap energy is no longer available and previously first world citizens get a taster of expensive energy, basically changing their lifestyle from a first world to a third world citizen in one generation or two, as a significantly larger percentage of their income will be used for necessities. this is something first world citizens are not used to and they won't like it and they'll protest, to no avail. everything from toothpaste to toilet paper will become more expensive, food, dvds, clothes, every single thing, and people will blame politicians, just like they're doing now, (as the process has already begun, but most don't know it), but it's the military/security who rules, and ordinary citizens cannot vote them out.  leaders have already shown a willingness to use drones against their enemies, and it is they who decide who their enemies are. probably starting in 20 to 50 years, when world leaders can longer hide the increasing expense (currently manufacturers are reducing package sizing rather than raising prices, but they won't be able to do that forever), then our world will be very unstable for awhile. now that would've been an interesting story, one which could've given movie goers a heads up, and also got them thinking about possible survival strategies: you know, helped them even though they'd not know the film story they'd currently be viewing for entertainment might actually help them survive future upheaval. but few government/military/security allow truly helpful movies to be made, especially ones that tell on them, or warn citizens about the future, especially if it reflects poorly on rulers. so instead we're given a film like elysium, with it's hero who can somehow, unbelievably, remain on his feet despite being stabbed in the gut, and who provides first class health care, albeit temporarily, for all. bread and circuses. 2 and a half stars.

The ring world of Elysium reminds me of books by Larry Niven,, although this man made paradise is space was created for the super wealthy elite who leave the over populated and diseased planet Earth behind. The people left living on Earth dream of living on Elysium and steal shuttles to try to emigrate there, and like the Mexicans who face danger coming into this country (the Movie is filmed partly in Mexico and most of the actors speak Spanish with subtitles) don't always make it alive.

The worst part of this movie was the story - which was about the magical beds they have on Elysium that cures everything without as much as a single cut or stich - followed by the acting. Damon plays his normal character, although he's more of a whiney, frightened, coward who makes bad choices consistently rather than a hero. Jody Foster - who in my opinion is one of the most highly overrated actors of all time - creates a bizarre character with an even more bizarre accent. I don't know what she's trying to do with this role, and I don't think she did either. I regret paying full price for this very poor film.

The movie is treating the viewers like morons who have to be told over and over that the bad guys are VERY BAD. And the basic sci-fi framework of the story is also impossible to swallow. There's amazing space-habitat, space flight, and medical technology, and in all the sky there's only ONE space station? And NONE of that technology is available on the ground, where it was presumably invented?  Building a believable sci-fi universe is HARD, but this movie really didn't try. Then there's the plot. It's like a 1950s sit-com: one character, no branching, and every other person in the movie is just wallpaper to decorate his linear path. And he is completely non-conflicted. There's never any question in his mind of what his goal is. The only interesting part of the story is that his goal changes over the course of his life. And the sacrifice he makes at the end is gratuitous. He doesn't mind dying to save the girl. So I didn't care either.  Then the incredible tie-up-all-the-loose-ends-in-one-fell-swoop ending, literally incredible.

Matt Damon was good but since the plot did not really go anywhere his influence was rather irrelevant. Did I mention the dialogue sucked? In some parts so did the photography.

5913877,1,B00EHK2S04,"Before I get into the main part of the review, I have a question.  Where is everyone else in the world?  It seems to the writer, only Hispanics matter.  It seems self-centered and ego-centric to me.  I wonder if the writer can even partially fathom the poverty, disease, and starvation in other parts of the world, such as parts of India and Africa to just name a couple.  It seems sad to me that the entire world is depicted as mainly being Hispanic.  It makes me sad to know that people can have such a limited view of the world in which we live.  I suggest those who do think this way take a moment to google starvation Africa and starvation India, look at the articles stating the numbers, and click on images to see the suffering of the people.  There is no excuse for ignoring everyone else on the planet except Hispanics/Latinos.

Now, on to the review.

I love sci-fi movies, and I enjoy movies trying to make a statement, such as District 9.  While this movie attempted to do both, it failed at both.  I wanted to like it.  Matt Damon and Jodi Foster?  Talented actors.  Except this time around.

The movie was about Caucasian haves and mainly Hispanic and Caucasian have-nots.  I think it was meant to make some kind of point about some kind of injustice; however, it never explained the injustice, made its point, or explained the motivations of the haves and have nots or the history of both worlds.  Haves were cruel apparently for no reason.  Have-nots wanted a cure-all medical device that the haves had.  Why did only the haves gain access to the machine?  Was it astronomically expensive?  Was it made from rare metals?  We will never know.  We only know they had it, and out of the cruelness of their evil little shriveled hearts, they were not going to share it with the have-nots.  I would have liked some background and a richer more developed story and characters.  It was very superficial.  It was supposedly about a deep subject, but it was so superficial that it completely missed the mark.

The writing was so bad that it made Matt Damon and Jody Foster seem like the worst actors ever.

I don't have much else to say about this movie, except to advise that if you watch it, turn off the sound and multi-task.

-------------------------------------

Added:  As some do not think this review was helpful, I will add to it to explain further:

The characters in the movie are one-dimensional; Jodi Foster's is the most one-dimensional character.  In addition, her accent was atrocious.

Now if my review was down-rated due to any political beliefs of the down-raters, I must add that I do feel the people in the movie should have been more diverse.  You may believe that Hispanics are the only people in poverty in the entire world, but you are wrong if you believe that.  This movie was about the entire world of Earth containing have-nots, and the space station above earth containing the haves.  The people of Earth were Hispanic, except for a couple of white guys and one black guy, basically.  Well, I happen to believe that there are poor of all races, cultures and national origins.  Poverty is not reserved specifically for Hispanics.  There are poor Africans, poor Asians, poor peoples of India, poor American Indians, poor middle eastern peoples, poor black people, poor Celts, poor Aussies, poor Russians, poor Europeans, poor gypsies, etc.  Yes, there are even poverty stricken Caucasians.

I think it is over-simplistic and wrong to attempt to portray the world as good, poor Hispanics v.s. evil, wealthy Caucasians.

If you believe in the 99% as many with positive reviews do, then you must know Caucasians are included in the 99%; the 99%ers are not Hispanic only.

This movie was supposedly about the entire world, yet ignored most of the peoples of the world.

I do think the plot was badly written.  I do think the acting was one-dimensional.

I also think the story did not draw the watcher in, because it did not explain anything about how the planet became like this or have fully developed characters.  Why can't the people of Earth plant, farm, and make and improve the planet?  Is there water on the planet still?  They obviously obtain weapons ... can they not fight to gain any of the planet back as a free area?  Are there any resources left on the planet?  Why is there only one Elysium (space station)?  Why aren't there many?  What caused people to move to Elysium?  Why not have something similar on Earth?  The Earth in the movie didn't look like it had air pollution problems ... it looked dry, but that was one area of the planet and not explained.  Those people on Earth looked like they had food.  Where were they getting their food?  Why don't people fight the police?  Why don't more people put on the exoskeletons?  Why don't the people make their own Elysium?  Couldn't they steal the parts and technology if they had to?  Nothing was explained except to basically show the haves had a medical cure-all machine and would not share it with the have nots.  The haves lived on a beautiful space station and would not share it with the have nots.  Otherwise, we were shown nothing else.  Life is not that simplistic, one dimensional or non-diverse.  In addition, the characters were so superficial that I simply could not become invested in them.  I was not drawn in.  I was bored.  I was intellectually insulted.  I yearned for diversity.  But, I was not invested.

The movie also seemed to demean even the Hispanic/Lantino people.  They were powerless to help themselves, so they needed a white savior to save them?  sigh.

In the year 2154, the earth has become a veritable wasteland of poverty, pollution and overpopulation (what a surprise). The wealthy elite have long since fled to a paradisiacal spaceship named Elysium (after the section in the Greek underworld reserved exclusively for heroes and poets) permanently orbiting the planet, where they lead lives of pampered ease, leaving the great unwashed masses back home to fend for themselves. Some of those masses make occasional desperate stabs at reaching the ship, where they are captured and put into camps, if they're lucky, or blown to smithereens before being able to land if they're not. Matt Damon plays a Joe Blow schmuck who, after receiving a fatal dose of radiation on the job, agrees to get in with a pretty bad crowd in order to get to Elysium to get a cure (the wealthy have all the medicines while the poor are left on Earth to sicken and die).

A post-apocalyptic tale for the Occupy generation, this allegory of class division and illegal immigration is the brainchild of Neill Blomkamp, the South African writer/director who gave us the surprise critical and commercial hit ""District 9"" in 2009.

Unfortunately, in a number of respects, ""Elysium"" doesn't quite rise to the level of that earlier film. Damon's Max de Costa is such a dull Everyman character that he goes from relatable to boring in no time flat. And the story, though promising at first, quickly stalls out, as Max spends an inordinate amount of the movie's running time just trying to get up to Elysium - though, once he gets there, things do pick up considerably.

Purse-lipped Jodi Foster hams it up as the cold-blooded defense secretary whose job it is to make sure that nothing or no one threatens the idyllic life in Elysium - a woman so evil and callous she makes Cruella Deville and the Wicked Witch of the West look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.

Shortcomings aside, however, ""Elysium"" uses first-rate art direction and production design to create a compelling vision of the future. Its sociopolitical subtext also lends it a gravitas that the story itself could never have achieved on its own. Add to that a genuinely touching ending and you have a movie that fails to fulfill the promise laid out by ""District 9"" but which has virtues of its own to recommend it.",1389916800,,2305,4.8106060606060606

5913901,4,B00EHK2S04,"NEILL BLOMKAMP, the South African director/writer who gave us District 9 (2009), returns to science fiction in Elysium featuring Matt Damon as planet-bound worker drone Max and Jodie Foster as evil Homeland Security chief, Delacourt.

While the Academy Award nominated District 9 presented an exploration of segregation and prejudice depicted in a mock-documentary format, Elysium takes us to a time when differences between the 1% and the remaining 99-percenters have separated humanity into two environments.

The bulk of humankind exists in a ruined, overpopulated Earth, where police and personnel/customer service droids mock the professionals they're designed to emulate. The elite 1% live off-Earth in a gorgeous space station, where the grass is green and the mansions are supersized to accommodate a handful of plus-sized egos and fortunes. What is best about the film  the amazing design and effect work  is perfectly translated to Blu-ray with outstanding detail and believability. Fine detail is explicit and skin shades look natural. Ruined Earth is sandy and dry, packed with towering ghettos; everything is crumbling, dirty and sweaty. Life is fairytale gorgeous on Elysium, with stunning blue water, blue skies and flowering landscapes. Its one big party and every home has a full-body medical scanner that can diagnose and cure the worst disease within minutes. Cancer? Dont even think about  its gone almost as soon as its discovered in the cells.

Damons Max is a thief, recently out of prison, and working at a recycling facility. An unnecessary accident bathes Max in radiation that will leave him dead within the week. Hes made to sign his X on a release form, given a bottle of pills to keep him operating normally until death, and escorted out of the med-center before he can dirty the sheets. Meanwhile, up on Elysium, Delacourt justifies her methods of keeping Planet Earth riff-raff separated from the elite population to President Patel (Faran Tahir) who disapproves.

So it looks like an assassination is in order and Delacourt gathers her cronies to set it up, including arch-nasty, Kruger played by Sharlto Copley of District 9. Back on Earth, Max gets involved in a scheme to invade Elysium and, perhaps, equalize factions. He prepares by suiting up in a cyborg exo-skeleton and a lot of clich&eacute;s fall into place: A cute but poor kid with leukemia, an old girlfriend, the pal ready to sacrifice himself, and an evil senator. It all climaxes with some great looking rusty ships, a craft crash onto the pretty space station, massive firefights and a one-on-one showdown between Max and Kruger. This plays out well on the home surround system, with all the effects thundering through the walls, while dialogue  such as it is  remains clear.

Special features for both DVD and Blu-ray include Collaboration: Crafting the Performances in Elysium, and Engineering in Utopia: Creating a Society in the Sky. Exclusive Blu-ray bonus features are an extended scene, and segments titled Visions of 2154: An Interactive exploration of the art & design of Elysium, The Journey to Elysium  Envisioning Elysium, Capturing Elysium, Enhancing Elysium; In Support of Story: The Visual Effects of Elysium and The Technology of 2154.

Unfortunately, nothing stands out among the extras, not even the extended scene. If you have seen any movie tech docs lately, theres nothing new to be learned here. Interviews stand on how much everyone liked each other, although one point of interest (Spoiler Alert!) is when Copley talks about killing Jodie Fosters character onscreen, the first time thats been done in all the films Foster has made. Jodie advises that her kids will probably enjoy that bit.

While not great science fiction, Elysium has its entertaining moments. Still, parallels to todays society are so obvious as to break into the suspension of disbelief needed to bring its message home.",1389830400,,3914,5.193650793650794
5913902,3,B00EHK2S04,"Firstly I have to say I am a huge sci fi fan & regardless of what I heard, I was going to watch it anyway for the special effects.  Secondly the casting of Matt Damon, Sharlto Copley & Jodie Foster was brilliant, but the plot didn't allow enough screen time for Foster's menacing French accented character to suit me.  Though she managed to secure the plot line in the little time given her, she is an American Judy Dench, stealing every scene she's in.  I also love that she hasn't succumbed to the plastic look of her peers & has aged like a fine wine.  Sharlto was scary as heck, & as much as I loved him in District 9 I had a hard time even remembering it was the same guy because I hated his character in this film. He was as ruthlessly violent as Jodie was controlling. Lastly, Matt Damon, the man delivers as always a character that completely makes you forget this is Matt Damon.  His Spanish was incredible & he really did what he could to flesh out this pathetic guy.  My problem was with this film the have nots.  I understood that in some slums there is property beyond comprehension, but his orphan friend managed to become a nurse & appeared to have done it miraculously given the circumstances.  That's what blew it for me, & the homies who were brilliant computer dudes who could read code but still lived in squalor? No way.",1389830400,,1341,4.357429718875502

We're then led to believe that over the next 70 years, lots and lots of rich people are going to be moving metric tons per second of stuff into orbit (starting today) to build this station.

5913925,3,B00EHK2S04,"Matt Damon made a movie to show inequalities of privilege and the chaos that can exist because of bad laws.  The movie starts with bold statements that explain why things are the way they are, which includes a ""vastly overpopulated earth.""  The chaos exists because those who consider themselves citizens have abandoned the common rabble and have denied them help.  The rich no longer have a gated community.  They have their own floating paradise off of the planet where they do not speak Spanglish as in wasteland LA.  The ""citizens"" speak English and French fluently, and have all the medical care they need.  Damon's character grows up under the care of Catholic religious sisters who never speak of God or prayer, only to ""remember where you came from (earth).""  and ""you were born to do great things.""

Sci Fi moments were very intense and high energy.  Droid technology of the future is interesting.  Elysium in space is incredible work of technology for the screen.  Movie is too fast for character development.  This is a sci-fi extreme tale of what Damon believes is happening now.  Hopefully the viewer can see the problem.

If only the rich would pay for them life would be good.  Give me a break.  Why doesn't the rich and powerful in Hollyweird pay for them if they believe in it so much.  They are some of the most rich people in the world, hear that Matt Damon.

I felt like I was being preached to by a bunch of hypocritical children.

This is a political piece!  It's not realistic and ends with ""EVERYONE IN THE WORLD having ""FREE"" Health Care.  Side story lines make the viewer see this as the only ""decent"" future.  I wonder who pays for it ?  Technology doesn't come free.  Now or in the future.

The rich basically abandoned the entire planet. I am well aware of he growing income gap in the USA. I don't see it growing to the point that the entire planet is turned into a ghetto. So instead of buying an island or a home in an overpriced super-gated community, the wealthy leave the planet??? Based on the plot it appears the majority left on Earth are apparently too stupid to develop commerce and infrastructure??? Oh, and latinos are now the illegal immigrants of the entire planet?

I give Matt Damon kudos (which is why two stars vs one) for trying but the plot is even beyond my ability to imagine those far fetched  possibilities.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: A sci-fi drama starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, ELYSIUM is set in the future, when two classes of people exist: the very wealthy, who live on a pristine man-made space station called ELYSIUM, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth.

It is the year 2154 and the wealthy have fled the overpopulated and largely resource-drained Earth in favour of ELYSIUM, a luxurious space habitat located in the planet's orbit. With no poverty, no sickness and no war, the contrast between Elysium and the ravaged planet it revolves around couldn't be starker, and is tough for those left on Earth to bear. When Max De Costa [Matt Damon] learns that he has no hope of beating the cancer that has afflicted him without breaking into Elysium, he understands the scale of the task he has undertaken. With Secretary Delacourt [Jodie Foster] charged with enforcing ELYSIUM's strict anti-immigration policies and a team of hardened troops at her disposal, led by the ferocious Agent Kruger, Max faces the battle of his life if he intends to bridge the cosmic gap between rich and poor.

Max [Matt Damon] grew up looking to the heavens, but that doesn't mean he looked very far. Rather than distant stars or even the Earth's own moon, he set his gaze upon the largest object in the sky: ELYSIUM, a manmade paradise reserved for the wealthy and the fortunate. They built the station some time before and left behind the overcrowded, resource-dry Earth for a green, clean paradise in the heavens. Max always promised his friend Frey [Alice Braga] that he'd get them to ELYSIUM. Years later, Max is still on Earth, slaving away at a job manufacturing the very law enforcement robots that harass him, injure him, and extend his parole. Frey's life hasn't been much better. She's a doctor but cannot help her sickly daughter Matilda [Emma Tremblay] who could be healed in mere moments with ELYSIUM's radically advanced medical technology. When Max is accidentally irradiated at work, he's given only days to live. His only option is to reach Elysium and its healing bays, a task that's nearly impossible given its fortifications and armaments and the people ready to use them, chief amongst them Secretary of Defence Jessica Delacourt [Jodie Foster]. Max makes a deal to participate in an information-gathering raid on a high-ranking Elysium citizen named John Carlyle [William Fichtner] to gather intelligence on the heavenly paradise. In exchange, he's offered a forged Elysium identification tag and, therefore, a cure for his ailment. Matters are complicated when a dangerous Elysium sleeper agent named Kruger [Sharlto Copley] is ordered to intercept Max at all costs.

But the gunfire and fisticuffs are nevertheless done very well, as is all of the other glitz and glamour and production values the film has to offer. ELYSIUM is careful not to allow its action to overwhelm the plot. Instead, every gunfight and every action scene flows naturally from the story, a consequence of the drama rather than its driving force. It's very well-staged and expertly executed with a precision but also a rawness that together give the movie an edge and compliment the bloody, gritty reality of the world and story, not to mention the  mechanical add-ons that superficially aid and shape the characters but not nearly as much as does their underlying humanity, or lack thereof. Even Damon's Max is, to a large extent, the classic reluctant hero type whose life is defined by a distant dream and the forced existence that keeps him from it. Sharlto Copley's Kruger, aside from the obvious play on the name, turns in the film's best performance as a wild, uncontrollable, unpredictable hunter. The cast is supported by terrific visuals, in many ways much the same style as seen in District 9, from the slums to the exploding bodies, from the robots to the flying ships. Nevertheless, it all fits into this world effortlessly and, in a way, beautifully. The effects are seamless which is a critical factor in making the film as absorbing as it can be, dazzling the audience while keeping the story, not shoddy visuals, first.

Blu-ray Video Quality  ELYSIUM' features a reference-quality transfer. Sony's ""mastered in 4K"" presentation looks magnificent in every scene, revealing superb colours and pinpoint details for the duration. The palette pops with regularity. Even in the largely barren, earthen sandy future Los Angeles, the colours take on a very even, natural, lived-in appearance, from clothing to graffiti. Things look even better on ELYSIUM. Green grasses, red robots, and all variety of bold, bright colours sparkle, and distance shots of Earth's blue waters look positively stunning. Darker moments, too, enjoy natural balance, aided a great deal by deep, positive blacks. Flesh tones enjoy natural shading. Fine detail is terrific. Close-ups of worn-down technology, weapons, skin textures, frayed clothing, dirt terrain, and crumbling structures show very real, very tactile attention to detail. Image clarity is superb in every scene, whether evident in the clean lines of ELYSIUM or the downtrodden Earth locations. The image is impeccably clean and shows no signs of blockings, banding, or other troublesome elements. This is a terrific image in every regard.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  ELYSIUM' explodes onto Blu-ray with a powerful 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. As one might rightly expect of a major studio new release of a futuristic Action/Science Fiction film, track dynamics are impeccable, spacing magnificent, and the overall effect one that replicates a theatrical experience down to the lightest note and tiniest bit of ambient support. Musical delivery enjoys even, rich front-side spacing, impeccable clarity through the entire range, balanced surround support, and precision bass. Action effects rightly dominate. Gunfire practically tears apart the soundstage while literally shredding in-movie environments. It's loud, precise, heavy, and both exhilarating and frightening. The rumble of ships, the wallop of explosions, and all variety of chaotic sound effects satisfy in every scene. Light ambience helps define a number of scenes, whether zipping vehicles or the din of a busy factory. Dialogue plays evenly and firmly from the centre. This is another winner from Sony.

The piece focuses on the ""Raven"" and other flying vehicles, the robots, and a scene depicting the repair of damaged flesh.

Special Feature: The Technology of 2154 [2013] [1080p] [10:13] A look at the picture's ""metaphorical"" technological designs with emphasis on robots, exoskeletons, and weapons.

Sneak Previews: Additional Sony Blu-ray Titles available

Finally, ELYSIUM' isn't so dissimilar with another recent film Upside Down depicting two distinct classes of people living in proximity to one another and separated not by artificial boundaries but rather the real dividing line of gravity and the more artificial division of wealth and privilege. That film shapes its tale as a romance while ELYSIUM's action-oriented story tackles a political agenda that's today forefront on every news page, blog, and television news station around the world, and particularly in the United States. It's a rather heavy-handed film, not masking its agenda and sometimes not taking all the truths of utopia and man into account, rather focusing on broad ideals and stereotypes. That doesn't make it a bad film, though. On the contrary, it's quite entertaining and very well made while still a film ripe for further dissection in both the film study and politics classrooms for a number of reasons and with almost no end to the possibilities for analysis. It doesn't capture the same balance between storytelling, social commentary, and action as District 9, but Neill Blomkamp has certainly proven that he knows what he's doing behind the camera. Sony's Blu-ray release of ELYSIUM' features reference quality video and audio. The only negative aspect of this film is that Neill Blomkamp had to have some tokenism South African actors included and this I found this not very conducive and very jarring, as the accent for a start is so off putting, especially the really nasty negative character that eventually got his comeuppance and again I feel this particular actor could have been played by someone who can act and is not like a cardboard cut-out and was not very convincing as the bad element of the film, but despite this slightly negative aspect of the film, I still think it is a very outstanding film and a joy to watch, especially with this Exclusive Limited Edition SteelBook and it is a great honour to add this to my extensive SteelBook Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Not one of Matt Damon's better films, not by a mile but movies are kind of scraping the bucket for plots it seems as we really haven't had one great movie in some time.",1389312000,,455,4.123595505617978

5913998,3,B00EHK2S04,"Like District 9, the other SF film done by this director, the idea in this film is good, but he just doesn't quite pull it off.  The story line has a few unrealistic aspects, such as how the hero (Matt Damon) suddenly goes from a weak radiation sickness victim to almost a super hero simply by donning an exoskeleton.  Both Jody Foster and Matt Damon appear to be just paying lip service to the movie, although Jodie does pretty well as the unfeeling, power driven Secretary of ""defense"". However, somehow, she uncharacteristically sheds this fighting personality and just gives up as she sees her world collapsing around her.  That scene just doesn't track with the character that was portrayed during the first half of the film.
If you are looking for something deep and philosophically profound in this film, forget it.  If you are looking for mindless SF, shoot-em-up entertainment, it's worth a look.",1389312000,,905,4.857142857142857

It was obviously trying very hard to make statements about wealth disparities and immigration issues which it completely undermined by casting Matt Damon as the white savior of all the poor brown, Spanish speaking people. It used tired tropes like damseling the female love interest and using rape as a plot devise. It was also bizarrely culturally appropriative. The final battle was INSIDE A TECHNOLOGY/CHEMICAL PLANT with cherry blossoms wafting gently by anime style. What. Those should not be in a clean facility. The main antagonist (another white guy) also fought with throwing stars and a katana. In the future. Against guns and laser weapons. Because that made complete sense.

Naturally, I spot the cliches, Hollywood 'standards', unfounded plot twists and feature stretching ingredients. Elysium has a few of these. I think any Hollywood Sci-Fi flick is bound to. It is probably impossible (at this point) to make a film without SOMETHING which has been done before. Elysium, however, rises far enough above these staples to provide an excellent show I have already watched twice. The first time I picked it to death as I spotted one little thing after another. The second time I just watched the show and enjoyed it much more.

The script is good, the actors and acting is very good throughout, and the visual is pretty fair, really. I hope I would never expose a story line or otherwise ruin a good movie for those who are thinking about getting or watching it. I recommend this movie. I've bought it, but that's what I do. I still think it would be fine in a theater.

As far as the highly negative comments by some reviewers, in my humble opinion, these are ultra conservatives railing about hot-button right wing political issues which have nothing to do with whether or not this is an entertaining show.",1389225600,,1234,4.655963302752293

If you just want to see great fight sequences and action and don't care about a great story line this movie is yet again a disappointment. The action scenes were few and far between.

Take literally the same setting and art direction, turn the protagonist (actor wise) from District 9 into the antagonist, and just craft an eerily similar story but without the aliens and add Matt Damon.  It's also interesting to note that each film focuses on some kind of segregated habitat for a designated population.  District 9 was a segregated community for the unclean and unwelcome, and now Elysium is the paradise escape from the rest of the world which was deemed unclean and unwelcomed. And unfortunately, the ending is given away at the end of the first act, and it's predictability completely killed the final twist.

If you want a good sci fi movie try oblivion instead- I hate Tom Cruise but damn if I don't like most all of his movies so bad as he is as an actor (like Jen anniston he can't act, has 1 persona, and plays it in everything he is in), ; they managed to make Jodi Foster and Matt Damon both look likes hacks, and it's obvious they both needed some cash- the plot, what little exsisted was just completely uninteresting, and this was not a sci fi movie, nor exactly an action movie, so what was it trying to be? This was in my opinion a straight to video hack job seeking to bank cash on having some names in it. Sorry hollywood- it isn't bad enough you can't come up with original ideas and just keep remaking stuff like robocop 50 times over, but  this was a complete waste of film.

5914066,1,B00EHK2S04,This movie turned out to be a waste of my time.  It's a classic case of producers thinking that they just need to get a big name actor and throw a lot of money at animation and effects and they'll end up with a blockbuster.  Who needs writers right?  The viewers will be so impressed with the visuals they won't even notice the absence a story...  The only coherent fragments of the plot were overly predictable and stereotyped.  The plot was so full of holes that it lost any emotive effect on me and the character development was so shallow I've already forgotten them.,1389052800,9,571,4.451923076923077

I would have liked to have seen more of Elysium (the exchanges between the President and Jodi Foster's character hinted at some interesting politics...).  Matt Damon also makes a great action hero who can carry a fast paced plot and I wish they would have let him, the technology (bio-computer interfaces, android technology, space habitats, a Bugatti space shuttle!), and a different plot drive the film.  Instead, I was beat over the head with the message that we need to treat immigrants to the US better with all the time spent in post apocalyptic Mad Max isn't quite in charge yet LA.  I also thought the whole medical care for everyone thing was a bit heavy handed.

5914087,3,B00EHK2S04,"I love Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and sci-fi, so I was really hoping to like this film. The premise is promising - in a future time, privileged humans live on a utopian artificial planet called Elysium, with everyone else condemned to the hell an overpopulated, environmentally devastated earth has become. Jodie Foster plays a heartless head of Homeland Security on Elysium, charged with keeping away illegal immigrants from earth. Matt Damon is a hard-working former con, now working in a factory, who is injured in an industrial accident, and whose only hope of survival is to make it to Elysium. There's some more twists and turns, but that's the basic plot.

The setting and special effects are good, and both Damon and Foster are fun to watch, even though the script is thin for both of them. They are the only reason I kept watching, as the movie disintegrates into graphic violence, including slow-motion shots of one guy's face getting blown off. The fight scenes go on and on, and take over the second half of the movie, so that any chance the film had of probing issues of immigration, economic inequality, or anything else, are completely lost.

In fact, there is little need for sound as they show you early in the movie why a trip to Elysium can be beneficial, even if you only stay 10 minutes. Hence the plot.  I also thought it was full of class division and propaganda.  No one on Elysium cares or tries to help the people on Earth. Turns out they had the means to do it all along.  The movie starts off in Spanish but just as I was beginning to wonder if I bought the wrong version, they switched to English.

5914118,1,B00EHK2S04,"Apparently the politicians and corporations got their wish for cheap votes and cheap labor and the world presented is filled with shanty, slummy, spanish speaking masses. White flight involved leaving the entire planet, I guess to escape all of the crime, graffiti, and in general the dirtiness that the non-Anglos brought. It would seem that when they left the people that remained were left to suffer what people suffer when a majority European population is no longer there to provide civilization. The superior people that escaped created a beautiful utopia in space, complete with peaceful gardens and lovely architecture. They created these beds where one can just lie down in them and be healed of whatever ails them.

They also created a police force of robots to patrol down on Earth, but strangely, they did NOT create robots to work in the factories, which would have been MUCH easier to achieve than creating a robotic police force, but that would have messed up the ""story"" I guess. What use would the brown people have if not to work in the factories? Quite a cynical and condescending view if you ask me but Damon and the filmmakers are of course entitled to their opinion. But do they really think that all hispanic people do is commit crimes, get tattoos, and work in low wage jobs? They really should leave their personal Elysiums of private jets and heavily-secured mansions to see that this is not true.

So one of the few pure Europeans left on Earth is played by Matt Damon. He stands out as having a work ethic and he has to defend himself against the dirty spanglish speakers who want him to help them commit crimes but he had advanced himself and no longer did crimes, but they apparently could not do the same. They need his superior abilities to pull off a particular job and eventually when it becomes about saving himself, the superior being, he concedes to it. Although the filmmakers tried to pretend that these lesser beings were real tech savvy, again, so the story had proper villains, they just keep failing over and over in their missions.

Jodi Foster's character will apparently do anything to preserve Elysium, a place where a woman can have a position of power unlike the baby-makers and nurse jobs provided by the 3rd worlders on Earth. The brown people on Earth can't advance themselves so they are constantly invading Elysium to live the life that the superior white people created but Jody understands that they will only bring the very things that the white people escaped from in the first place, so she is tough on them, shoots them right out of the sky. One frightening scene involves a nice white family enjoying the beautiful park and then this ship of brown people comes swooping in and terrorizes them.

I didn't watch any further than when Damon is on a ship, I guess headed to Elysium, with the brown lady. The white superiority theme got too boring so I don't know if the brown people destroyed Elysium or not or if the Great White Hope played by Damon helped the little girl.",1388880000,7,3031,4.702448210922787

The message in the movie may not be too far off target either which is a very scary thought.  The way the ""1%"" is looting the entire planets economy and leaving the other ""99%"" to get by with less and less every year it seems.  In my lifetime I've watched the Elite push greed to a whole new level.

No.  Do you have to accept a few borderline ideas, like Elysium itself, not to mention the healing beds? Yes.

Yet the science in this movie is exactly what is in the early stages of being developed and exactly what humanity (what exists of it) will be capable of in 1-2 centuries. However the truth behind this movie is that the poor will never see a future that the rich will see. This rings true right now today. My guess is if you rated it 1 star you are incapable of looking through the looking glass because you live in the social class that is not serving those with means on this Earth. Great movie highly recommend it to those that are somewhat knowledgeable of science/class distinctions.

5914150,3,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium(released Aug/13)stars,among others,Matt Damon,Jodie Foster,Sharlto Copley and Alice Braga. This is a film that has a nice look to it,with sharp looking S/FX,but we have yet again a meandering plot with all the usual tricks of the writing trade and with little substance overall.
The story finds Damon as an ex con living in an over populated and devastatingly run down Los Angeles. All the rich of the world have fled to a space station orbiting the earth. And the folks on earth constantly dream of saving up enough moolah to get up there. One day at work Damon gets exposed to a radiation overdose and he seeks the help of a man he used to work for to get him to Elysium where he can be saved.
Meanwhile on Elysium,Foster the defense secretary,is having problems of her own. She has just shot down three shuttles from earth trying to land illegally and has killed a significant number of people in the process. The president is none too pleased and she is given a short leash. She hatches a scheme with the owner of the same company Damon works for. She gets him to produce a computer app that will rewrite the programming on Elysium and install her as the new president.
Damon's old boss says the only way he will get him up to Elysium is if Damon can steal the new app his boss has made. They outfit Damon with an exo skeleton drilled right into his body. It will not only enhance his physical strength,but also comes with a brain implant which will allow Damon to store the app data in his brain for download later. As Damon's present boss prepares to leave earth,Damon and some selected assistants bring his shuttle down. They are working on short time as some clandestine hired hit men(working for Foster)are also tracking the shuttle. Damon gets the info he needs but all of his team are killed. Seriously wounded he heads to the home of an old girl friend who patches him up. He leaves soon after not wanting to endanger her or her daughter. Foster puts a transmission lock down over L.A. and sends her clandestine group after Damon. They eventually find him and he is brought aboard the shuttle,which later arrives on Elysium. His old girl friend and her daughter are also on board,being used as a bargaining chip. Damon plays along until the leader tries to over power him just before they land,resulting in the leader losing most of his face in a grenade blast. Damon's old flame spirits her daughter to a home,which has a medical unit which can reverse her deadly leukemia.
During this commotion Damon's old boss has arrived on Elysium also,and meets up with Damon and examines the data. It turns out the data will make everyone on Earth a citizen of Elysium. While they fight their way to a main terminal,Foster has confronted her bag man over his incompetence. After having just reconstructed his face,he kills her and sets out to find and kill Damon. The battle eventually arrives,with Damon coming through in grand style. Damon and his old boss finally reach the terminal and Damon is plugged into it. The download will kill Damon but end Elysium's control over itself and its citizens. Damon pushes the button himself and the download begins. The Elysium computers having recognized Earth citizens as their own,now dispatch medical ships to Earth to heal the inhabitants there,in need. Damon of course is kaput-skied.
As I said it is a meandering plot and Damon's""acting"" does nothing for this reviewer at all. Quite vanilla actually. And the plot,well let's look at some ""issues""I have with the story. What is with that space station?When we first see it,it looks like they reused the miniature from 2001 a Space Odyssey. Then there's Foster's accent. She goes in and out of it,whatever in the world""it"" was! Then there is Damon's radiation overdose. The thing is to not make things so obvious,well,so obvious. There is a pallet obstructing a thick door from closing. In the little space open he tries unsuccessfully to kick it away. You know that if he goes inside the door will close behind him. What does his boss come along and tell him to do? Of course,go inside. And what does the door do?I think you know. And of course we must feel empathy for Damon,whose company treats their employees like crap. An old writing canard if there ever was one. Way too obvious and old hat. And in this film with such little depth,it stands out far too much. And finally(only because there is a limited space here)how in the heck did Damon's old boss get onto Elysium without being detected or attacked? At the beginning of the film we are given stark images of ships that try to illegally land being blown out of the sky. But not in this instance. I guess the writers REALLY needed him up there,whatever they had to do.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include two featurettes. It tells you on the outside of the DVD case that if you want more extras,buy the Blu-Ray. We always have known the industry has always been constantly pushing the consumer in certain directions(from records,to tapes,to CDs,from VHS to DVD's now to Blu Ray).We got that same spiel when they were forcing us into DVD's from VHS tapes. So if you were ever wondering whether we're being manipulated,that kind of confirms it.
All in all a lacklustre film with a lacklustre script. The plot has a lot of holes in it and Foster's attempt at some form of accent is hilarious. Damon is totally nondescript in his role;it could have been anyone(and anyone else may have done better!).",1388793600,15,5534,4.671106557377049

5914153,1,B00EHK2S04,"After watching this filth, I felt the need to inform others -- the first time I have written a review in many years.  Be warned!  What I liked: the premise of the station, the feeling of being trapped in a caste system, Jodie Foster's acting.  But, here comes the bad... 1) the symbolism was too ""in your face"" -- it needed to be more subtle; 2) the fact that Matt Damon's character was guilty of grand theft auto is not endearing or heroic or makes him sympathetic, which is what we need in order to make us turn against the oppression; 3) the use of the word ""illegals"" was too obvious to the point of being distasteful; 4) the computer screens have primitive interfaces -- not believable; 5) unsafe work situation was too contrived -- Matt Damon should have walked away -- there is no clear reason why he should defy common sense and put himself in danger or allow himself to be trapped with no one nearby to help; 6) the f-bomb!!!! What is this an 80s movie?  Do we just want to prove to the audience how mentally deficient the writers are?  Why do I want to sit through a movie with this kind of pointless and crude language?  Is it just a way to earn an R rating?  Is that something to be proud of?  Jodie Foster... PLEASE never sign up to be in a movie like this again.  You are better than this.; 7) Who is the main villain and why? 8) How does the atmosphere work on a station that isn't sealed? 9)  How does the gravity system work?; 10) Why can we see the station from space so clearly when the space station is just a small spec of light and is in a fairly low orbit?; 11) The motives of Jodie Foster's character are contrived and not believable; 12) The council's ""reprimand"" of Jodie Foster does not seem harsh enough; 13) The maniacal rogue agent became just plain silly -- the exo-suit of his was enough to groan it -- silly!; 14) the disparate medical care is not explained well; 15) the boys running to the medical ships -- how would they know to run to them? 16) At the end with people orderly boarding the ships -- no one who has been under a repressive system like that is going to come out of it acting orderly  and peace-like -- nothing good comes from treating people that way  -- and they will certainly not be anything other than disorganized, confused, desperate and destructive of things they do not understand; 17)  Theme... what was it?  It started as an ""in your face"" political melodrama and degenerated into an 80's f-bomb fest replete with mindless and silly action scenes.

Elysium has two well-known Hollywood stars and a big budget, a sure sign that it will suck compared to District 9. But I did not want to be prejudiced, so I watched it. In retrospect, prejudice would have saved me my $10something...

Character development is superficial. The main character, played by Matt Damon, is mostly a selfish person. Jodi Foster is exceptionally good at pretending to be a French native speaker who is fluent in English (the accent, the facial expressions during speech, all are perfect). Her character is supposed to be not likable, and she does a good job in that, too. Plot line is unexciting and unbelievable. No, let me rephrase that: in this kind of sci-fi film, of course one is dealign with stuff that is nor real (yet). But the film is supposed to create that alter-reality well enough that the events and characters seem plausible. So this film failed in doing that. The villains are two-dimensional, as expected. Action is not that exciting or spectacular, or gritty and satisfying, so fails to achieve neither.

Apparently, the Earth's resources have been destroyed by its people and the planet looks like a never-ending  Beirut.  I assume this is Hollywood's idea of their beloved 99%.  The people of Earth are called ""Illegals.""

Apparently, the people who have the funds, skills, intelligence, and rugged individual spirits, the 1%, have built a kick ass super space station called Elysium where they have medical pods that keep you alive and well forever.  Elysium appears to be crime and Obamacare  free, with plenty of green fields, clean water, clean air, and prosperous people.  The people of Elysium are called ""Citizens.""

Matt Damon is a maladjusted, tattooed, ex-criminal with five days to live who makes a deal with a bighearted crime overlord and Blah, Blah, Blah, they apparently reboot the Elysium computer and give all the billions of Mexicans (and the one black family) citizenship.  Immediately, the new ""immigrants"" hop on board thousands of space taxis and head for Elysium.  Literally...The End.

Whatever happened to Elysium?  Common sense would dictate that it was overwhelmed by the massive influx of ""new citizens"" and fell into a lower Earth's orbit where it burned to a cinder in the Earth's atmosphere.

The plot is well outlined in other reviews, so I will not go into it.  And the heavy-handed political message being delivered has been duly noted by other reviewers.

Something that other reviewers have not mentioned much is that the whole movie is sad.  The beginning, middle, and end are all sad and depressing.  There are no light moments to fill the gaps between horrible things that happen.

The director of this film has done a fantastic job at drawing you into this future world and using it to inspire emotion.  Ultimately, that is the goal of these entertainers:  to inspire emotion and make you think.  Well, this movie succeeded at making me feel depressed and thinking that the world stinks and always will.

Fortunately, I woke up the next day and realized it was just a movie.

So if you really want to get yourself depressed and find a reason to believe that the world stinks, you can watch this movie.  Or you can just read the news.  The choice is yours!",1388707200,,1058,4.534391534391534

5914208,3,B00EHK2S04,"This is a tough review.  I hover between 3 and 4 stars on this one.  The good:  I always enjoy watching Matt Damon, I think he gives the roles he plays his all.  Jodie Foster isn't bad either, although the French accent she attempts in this film is pretty laughable.  The special effects in this film stand out- they're very well done and believable, and don't get in the way by being super cheesy and over the top.

The bad: the plot is pretty cookie cutter- you see how it's going to go pretty early on.  Although some of the social commentary themes in this film are valid and may make you think a bit, it's all boiled down into a pretty simplistic story that gets pretty hokey by the end.  But Neil Blokamp's (sp?) direction stands out (not as much as his awesome ""District 9"") and makes this movie a bit more well crafted and interesting than the standard big budget fare.

I enjoyed this movie, but it was pretty forgettable and I had to turn my brain off at a certain point to keep it from calling BS on the plot.",1388620800,,1020,4.243523316062176

Unintelligent: It's supposed to be the future with technology so advanced they can live in outer space, but the ""techy"" artifacts on Earth are dated and not representative of a natural evolution that would likely take place and it's difficult to suspend my disbelief.
Unimaginative: The Elysium space station could have been so much cooler, as could the wastelands of Earth; they could have shown other countries, but chose to keep it to L.A. (boring), and the graphics looked like a college student's final project.
Inconsistent: Here's just one example - the protagonist (Matt Damon) is SOOOO in love with this girl, he tattoos himself with a childhood note she writes on his hand - but, when it comes time for him to save her (he is dying in 5 days anyway), he walks away and chooses only himself (half-hearted) - the level of emotional intelligence is for 5th graders
Shallow - they use Hispanic-American profiles for the immigrants and later in the movie use black actors to simulate those getting medical attention (too cliche like African's being treated for AIDS or something) and actually may be offensive to some.

We kept waiting for it to get better (ratings average 3 stars), but it went more and more downhill. The critics went easy on Blomkamp because of his reputation, but that shouldn't make you waste your time with this movie.",1388620800,4,1377,4.859574468085106

On Earth, life is hard, and the character played by Matt Damon suffers dangerous working conditions, uncaring bosses, and bleak prospects.

Worldwide, however, it seems that the desire to have admission to the benefits of Elysium is primarily because citizens have access to a miraculous medical technology that will, in seconds, cure cancer, restore lost limbs, and probably do a tummy tuck.  When Damon's character is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation, his new focus is to r each Elysium, and to do that, he must work with an underground project to open wide Elysium's computerized gates.  However, a team of assassins is sent to capture Damon's head (another story angle) and protect the gates.  These bad guys are pretty bad.

Most of the reviews on here are focused on the visuals and/or issues with the political overtones of the movie, but I was a lot more focused on trying to see a well-developed story that made me understand the world in which Elysium is based and the motivation for the characters and their actions. Instead, I found that the story seemed to give a bare-bones background on the situation/premise (i.e., you're just expected to understand the rich vs poor factions without any added depth, that some magical machines exist that cure any disease ever - although I was really confused when that machine apparently brings people back to life, too, and that a system reboot will somehow make everyone automatically accept a new leader/class system - I guess the great minds that built these magical devices don't have any critical thinking abilities...).

At first, I thought perhaps part of the story/characters were underdeveloped because of movie length issues, but when I looked back the movie was only around 105 minutes, and I think another 15 minutes to develop the characters and story could have made a huge difference.

My advice: wait until it's available to rent, but don't pay more than $2.99 for it (or better, wait until it's ""free"" as part of your Amazon Prime membership).  But, if mindless action, fights, and explosions in a highly formulaic movie is your thing, then by all means, spend your money - you may just like it.

Oh, and one more thing (in case the writers or director is reading this), try to find someone who doesn't sound like a complete douche bag to play the villain.

5914239,3,B00EHK2S04,"Neill Blomkamp's astonishing debut of DISTRICT 9 showed us that we could have bravura sci-fi films in this day and age that could not only function as a backdrop for cool effects, but could also have strong performances, nuanced social commentary and hellzapoppin' action set pieces. It is a modern masterpiece of science fiction cinema. So, naturally, when that film got the acclaim and attention that it deserved, and Blomkamp was given a bigger budget in which to give a larger palette to the audience, it should be brilliant, right? And to cast Oscar winners Matt Damon and Jodie Foster should make the performances even more vivid, right? And to have a story that deals with a very timely message about the haves and the have-nots should make it resonate even further, right?

So then, why is ELYSIUM so... kind of... just average?

It's 2154. The Earth isn't quite post-apocalyptic; it's just a huge planetwide slum. Pollution, over-industrialization, poverty, crime; it's just life now. And those who are fortunate enough to be wealthy have left Earth for an orbiting space platform called Elysium. It's perfect there. Life is elongated thanks to machines that can cure ANYTHING, and thanks to the rather zealous efforts of Elysium's Defense Secretary Delacourt (Foster), none of those grimy immigrants from Earth are going to make it to infect their idyllic society with their icky basic human needs. So while she's blowing illegals out of the sky, down below, Max (Damon) is a former car thief who's trying to get by as a blue-collar robot assembly worker. Through various events, he is blasted with a lethal dose of radiation and his only hope is to get to Elysium. But then there's a Che Guevara-esque pseudo-revolutionary, a lunatic Earth-bound sleeper agent of Delacourt's named Kruger (DISTRICT 9's Sharlto Copley), an old love interest (Alice Braga), her little daughter with leukemia, and a secret security code that has to be hardwired into a badass exo-skeleton, which also has to be drilled directly into Max's body as he is set up as the savior of the human race.

My main problem with this film isn't the stock characters, or the somnambulant performance of Damon, or the ""Really, where am I from?"" accent that Foster sports, or the major plot-shift that comes OUT OF NOWHERE regarding Delacourt and Kruger, or the ham-fisted social commentary the film really hammers into your brain. It's the lack of substance. As to be expected, the film looks fantastic. The shot composition, the sfx; it's amazing to look at. But the film doesn't do anything to create a world for these characters to exist in. We know it's crappy on Earth and we know it's amazing on Elysium because the film tells us that. But it never really explores what else is going on up there or down here. It just IS, and we're expected to go along for that ride. Any attempt at real storytelling is pretty much absent and that's where the film fails. When we're treated to a vision of the future, as an audience, we want to exist there for a while. We want to know what the world is like, and that's where DISTRICT 9 succeeded so well. It was a smaller story about a single place on the planet, and it got you involved and it built that world to the smallest detail. ELYSIUM should be epic, considering that it involves the whole planet, but it just seems to focus on one neighborhood in a typically dystopian future. At least Copley seems to be having a really good time as the delightfully psychotic Kruger, and there's some fun to be had with the robotic law enforcement.

I give ELYSIUM three stars out of five as opposed to its more deserved 2.5 because I firmly believe that, due to the incredibly brief running time of the film that there is a better, smarter and more complex cut of this film somewhere, and maybe someday, it will come to light.",1388534400,,3839,4.733931240657698

5914243,5,B00EHK2S04,"Plot:
In a not too distance future, Earth has become a mess; it's over populated, many are sick and much of the landscape has become a wasteland.  In steps Max, Matt Damon's character, who is a formal criminal trying to turn his life around until an unfortunate accident occurs and he's exposed to high doses of radiation. His only hope is to go to Elysium, a large, man-made structure orbiting the Earth, where the health care he needs access to is available and where the wealthiest individuals from Earth now reside.

Similarities:
There are quite a few movies that Blomkamp may have been inspired from: Robocop (character development), Blade Runner (setting) and The Day the Earth Stood Still (themes).  I would like to add that he does a great job building up the action and pumping up the violence like many Quentin Tarantino films.  It could also be considered a retelling of Robin Hood.

Themes:
Like Neill Blomkamp's first film, District 9, he dives the audience into contemporary themes concerning the environment, overpopulation, immigration, healthcare, class, etc; however, unlike District 9 which takes a look at these themes in Africa, it takes a look at these themes in the United States and the controversy from the themes he has chosen can be clearly seen from many the reviews here on Amazon.  I, for one, enjoy movies that touch hot-button issues as they can lead to insightful discussions with the right friends and family members.

Last comments:
I originally gave the movie four stars rather than five, but I think Blomkamp delivers a smart, action-packed, science-fiction film that holds up well with multiple viewings.  Again, I think the themes represent the current political climate in the United States which could make an interesting movie to come back to several decades from now.  Highly recommended for those with an open mind.

I love the setting. The nitty-gritty world of Earth was consistently well-developed with much attention to small details to make it feel real. It is was depressing and dark, but believable. Elysium was done in the same manner but on the opposite side of the spectrum.

But...one scene towards the end, the big 'fight scene', dragged on and on and I started losing interest. It came together once past that scene, but I was disappointed to find the big, climatic battle rather lackluster. I can't pinpoint why it didn't grab me, as it seemed to have all the elements it should. Perhaps it's that it went on too long.

5914287,5,B00EHK2S04,"""Bring down the bone saw!"" - One of the best films of the year.

Within the overall ranking of great film, there is a sub-section of great reserved for awesome Sci-Fi, the rarest of all great. This blog will begin with a review of such a film.

Having just seen Elysium I am more probably more envious of director Niell Blomkamp than any other person in the world right now. Besides the fact that Blomkamps now two feature films are fantastic, his other film is District Nine, hes only 33 and he operates as a visionary in the Sci-Fi genre, a genre where visionaries are in urgent demand.

In 2154 Earths wealthiest have abandoned the filthy scourge that has become our home planet and taken up residence on Elysium, a Garden of Eden type space station equipped with ultra-advanced medical technology. Its all just a quick shuttle ride away from Earth. Close enough to be realistic, but just outside the reach of masses.

Matt Damon plays Max, a heavily tattooed former criminal trying to get this life back on the straight and narrow, but the Los Angeles of 2154 where he resides makes it difficult. After a run of bad luck he is dealt a deadly dose of radiation while working at his factory job. From here Maxs only chance of survival is to get to Elysium. Conveniently, Max just happens to be on a first name basis with Spider, a mastermind hacker crime boss that has the means to get Max there. After an unpleasant scene were Max is fused to with a robotic exoskeleton all he needs to do to attain his passage is hijack a corrupt officials brain and download the data to his own.

The dismal picture that Blomkamp paints of our future as a species is grim, although slightly glorified. His Los Angeles 2154 resembles the favelas of current day Rio de Janerio, hardly a fictional dystopia, and although Damon is a pleasure to watch amidst this dystopian fiction, his overall goal of trying to save his own life is not enough to garner sympathy. It is difficult to care about the worth of a single ex-cons life amidst the pandemonium and violence that everyone around him also suffers.

This disconnect never really resolves itself despite an attempt: Max ends up trying to save his childhood friend, and her daughter too. It doesnt work, but it also doesnt matter. This film is about wholes, big pictures, sums of all things greater than the individual. The technological marvels of Elysium are matched only by the decrepitude of the world that Blomkamp creates. A statement has been made loudly about humanitys potential trajectory, lest we decide to alter it.

Orbiting the Earth is  a space station for the wealthy and healthy-  the ""1%"".  More clichs: Los Angeles over run with the poor and they are all (except Matt Damon) of Latino descent and speak a slang Spanish and stand around all day long doing nothing as if they were in a  Hollywood ""gangsta"" movie. The ""1%"" on Elysium are primarily Anglo-Saxon and can speak French (because they are so sophisticated)  with a few Indians (a la Silicon valley? ) and Asians (as medical doctors) sprinkled in. Talk about racism on the part of the film maker.  Toss in your standard Australian- bounty-hunter/ Mercenary types and you have the setting for the movie. Pretty dumb.

  As for the action and plot- see the movie trailer and you will have seen it all.  Matt is a poor oppressed member of the 99% and is injured mortally inn an industrial accident.  he needs to get to Elysium because they can cure any disease (apparently their doctor can violate the laws of physics). Problem : he is an illegal alien.  He gets their (via some very poor special effects and ignorance of basic physics), reboots the central computer (as if there is just one program and not at least dozens as there are at any sizeable enterprise) and makes everyone a citizen of Elysium and thus everyone on Earth will be cured.

Second non-payoff: the entire populist uprising on a giant orbiting ringworld consists of one guy changing one line of code and hitting 'enter.'  No messy invasion of the unwashed.

5914296,4,B00EHK2S04,"This is a fun sci-fi watch, it's set in 2154 and the world is polluted and over populated, but for the more fortunate there is the Elysium space station which is a technological utopia. People on Earth are constantly trying to gain access to the orbital, but are dealt with harshly (although why the station has no defences of its own seems a bit odd).

Max (Matt Damon) is an ex-con who is poisoned in an industrial accident and his only chance is to be healed in a med bay only available on Elysium. He teams up with a resistance movement to gain access to the station. Meanwhile up on the station a plot is unfolding and Max finds himself caught in the middle and hunted by one of her agents (who is a pretty nasty bad guy).

For me the opening shots of Elysium were the high point of the film, they look lovely and there needs to be more of this type of thing in films (check out Cargo for something similar). From that point it's a blend of action and light political intrigue (Jodie Foster does a good job as the cold minister with her own plans for the station).

It's all fairly predictable but still manages enough to be an entertaining watch. Some of the effects were pretty cool (the air burst ammunition stood out) and everyone fills there roles well. It's also well filmed with some nice shots, but I have to say that District 9 was a better so if you haven't seen that then you should watch that first, if you have then give this a go, it's a fun watch, but not great.",1388448000,,1482,4.266903914590747

5914320,2,B00EHK2S04,"Tackling the 1-percent crowd with the same kind of subtlety he showed third-world racial relations in District 9, young auteur Neill Blomkamp presents a narrow, but thoughtful, glimpse into the not-so-distant future. As with his first feature-length showing, Blomkamp's vision and attention to detail are instant hooks, but the director carelessly chooses to cut bait before reeling in his big catch. This film's knack for the little things is easily its most striking feature: the robust, believable appearance of the world's widespread future tech, a melting pot of different languages amongst the commoners, a photographer's eye when fitting the upper class's orbiting space station into shots of the horizon.

Those intricacies at play, plus the dead-simple premise, make the first hour a real joy to behold. It's when the plot tries to get up and go in the second act, sadly, that it falls apart at the seams. There's just nothing to it; an immodest collection of bad action movie gimmicks and one-dimensional characters, it seems to lose track of the core message at twenty paces. It's constantly contradictive and routinely under-explains key concepts, not for added dramatic tension, but because nobody seems to have thought that far ahead. The frequent fight scenes are a handheld buffet, herking and jerking the screen right to the point of nausea and beyond. The list goes on. At the end of the day, even poor Matt Damon's redemptive character arc, a simple affair in which a selfish man finally makes a sacrifice to the betterment of his peers, is rendered pointless by a glaring, significant series of plot holes.

As a showcase of imagination, this is great stuff. It's the visual medium at its very best, a not-so-perfect postcard of a vivid, bustling future Earth that lives, breathes and kicks. As a sci-fi space drama, however, it's terribly, tragically flawed. Frankly, I couldn't wait for it to be over.",1388361600,,1923,5.082278481012659

But you will need to watch with subtitles or you won't be able to understand the bad guys accents half of the time.

Most of the 1-star reviews are angry at the plot and message of the film, which pits white elitists from Elysium against the mostly Latino, Spanish-speaking minorities living in a destroyed Los Angeles. We don't know exactly how the white elitists found their way to Elysium, but I suspect most people angry at the film's message would assume that they earned their way there by being more intelligent and more industrious, when in reality most of that robot technology was probably invented by the Japanese anyway. LOL. Sometimes in real life people work there way into upper society by hard work and being more intelligent, but many times people that end up there do so by having advantages that others from middle class or working class backgrounds don't have, and in some cases those elitists end up there because they have taken advantage of, swindled, and cheated others.

5914331,4,B00EHK2S04,"Nine Things about Elysium

1. This is a gorgeous, relevant science fiction film from Neill Blomkamp, the guy that made District 9.

2. Its set in the year 2154, when all the rich people have moved off Earth to an orbiting space station called Elysium. Matt Damon stars as an ex-con car car thief on Earth, living in the slums of LA.

3. Jodie Foster plays the secretary of defense of Elysium. Her main job seems to be to get rid of illegal immigrants that try to force their way into the rich world.

4. After an industrial accident infects Matt Damon with lethal radiation, he joins forces with a group of hackers trying to steal valuable financial information.

5. I always admire actors that aren't afraid to look like s***. Damon spends most of the movie dying from radiation poisoning and getting beat up. He does well. On the other end of the appearance spectrum, Foster is excellent as the fashionable, icy bitch that really runs Elysium. The way she enunciates words is so startlingly cultured that I had trouble paying attention to anything else when she talked.

6. Blomkamp seems to be obsessed with slums and favelas; this movie has a very similar look and feel to District 9. It could easily be occurring in the same world.

7. The lead role was first offered to a South African rapper named Ninja, but he didn't want it. Then it was offered to Eminem. But Eminem wanted to film the movie in Detroit, and Hollywood said no. So it was given to Damon.

8. There are definitely a few plot holes, but they don't take from the overarching story. The pacing and look of the film help distract you from paying too much attention to the problems.

9. Its not a particularly original film. Its about rich vs. poor, overpopulation, immigration, and the human condition. But the story is told well, the art design is delicious, and the acting is above average. Like Blomkamps first film, this is social commentary disguised as science fiction.",1388361600,,1945,4.614492753623188

5914369,4,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium was made by Neill Blomkamp, the same director that brought us the great District 9.  Elysium falls far short of District 9, but still manages to be a very good movie.  I am a complete sucker for a good sci-fi Dystopian future-type film including such films as Blade Runner and yes, even the Mad Max stuff.  Some critics have complained that Elysium is too ""political"" and reeks of ""Marxism"" and other claims.  Certainly, Elysium comes at us with a particular political and world-view which is, in my opinion, not so far off from the current social situation: the separation and division between the haves and have-nots.  Elysium simply examines and explores this social reality and carries it to it's extreme.  That is it's primary plot device.  It is not so absurd as it seems when you examine human history.  As ridiculous as the entire Nazi attempt to annihilate an entire people was, it did happen. And that is but one example of some of the strange notions that float about in the human heart from certain people who would have and control it all.  So we are dealing in the realm of probability here, not just with some odd, off-the-wall absurdity.

That being said, Elysium does suffer from some actual absurdities itself, often going way over-the-top with certain things.  I failed to buy into the robot cops who control the have-not populace.  I also failed to buy into the development of those ""magical"" devices of the haves that can seemingly diagnose and cure any kind of disease, such as leukemia, within a couple of minutes simply by lying down in it.  The entire exo-skeleton human enhancement device that is implanted onto our hero, Matt Damon, which becomes one strong factor in allowing him to beat up bad guys seems all wrong and ridiculous.  But now I'm getting nit-picking.  The real questions are:  is Elysium worth taking your time to watch and is Elysium a good movie?  My response is an absolute unqualified yes!  If you are a fan of dystopian sci-fi movies like I am, I think you will enjoy it.  If you have a rigid political viewpoint that finds any notion of a separation of classes based on wealth offensive or the introduction of any political viewpoint into your movies, then I wouldn't bother watching it.

As for me, I enjoyed Elysium in spite of the fact that it is far from a great movie.  It is a film I will be certain to watch many times in the future.",1388275200,3,2397,4.632701421800948

Even though there is ample opportunity to create nuance in the story, the movie never strays from the surface. Instead, it reads like a compilation of the short video clips featured throughout a poorly developed video game.

The first and most important problem is that the supporting characters have no motivation. They are reduced to caricatures of the selfless best friend (Diego Luna), the bloodthirsty soldier (Sharlto Copley), and the ambitious ice queen (Jodie Foster). Giving these characters the smallest amount of nuance would have made the film stronger, and the stratification between Earth and Elysium infinitely more interesting.

A second, related problem was predictability and consistency. You cannot have Copley's character viciously destroy enemies but, at the end of the film, inexplicably leave a key secondary character alive to assist the protagonist (and plot). The same applies to the automated soldiers that police both Earth and Elysium. They are shown to be incredibly effective in the first ten minutes of the film, but are hardly in sight in the final ten minutes when a major government facility is being assaulted.

Depending on your taste, this movie will either be a parable for today or pablum. For most, it will be the latter. Do yourself a favor and check out District 9, the director's first (and far better) feature film.",1388188800,,1587,5.19140625

5914402,3,B00EHK2S04,"Science fiction - be it movies, books, manuscripts, games, or just random thoughts, should have a very good understanding of science before the fiction is fully developed. As a writer I research material before inclusion, the same would-and should-go for movies. In this movie a band of thugs have the ability to put an exoskeleton on the hero, that connects to his nervous system directly. Once complete the hero is endowed with extra strength, though no additional intelligence or even common sense. Too bad, the decisions he makes are based on some very disturbing emotional ties made with a woman, (who else?), when he was a child. As a criminal in a world that makes dystopia  a word with all capital letters - bolded and underlined so the point isn't missed, there are just too many errors with the science to make the movie enjoyable as it might be done correctly. As a reader of all things science, I am updated on the exoskeletons DARPA among others, have worked on and are working on, for the battlefield and for those who suffer paralysis, either partial or total. Most allow for movement when a person cannot provide this on their own, but some do indeed allow a man to lift hundreds of pounds effortlessly. However, none of these ""iron-man suits"" connect to the nervous system at every point, from limb to brain, though a few do connect with the nerves in the stump of a lost limb for instance. For those who argue the science is secondary to the story line, I can only say those folks must watch a lot of 1930's to '50's movies - the science never mattered then, and the story line was secondary to the lighting effects! Matt Damon is good in the movie, supporting actors not even close, with the usual B-flick overacting at every corner. Spaceships are land vehicles that can fly since they all have rockets attached to them in one way or another. Coloration is wonderful though, giving a full star for that alone. Another star for Matt Damon's acting chops and the fact I liked his character - the every-man put into a position that only extraordinary courage and ability can overcome. Love interest aside, the female lead, is forgettable as last week's lunch at the kitchen counter, and it is to the credit of our hero she is remembered at all.  One star goes to the effects used with the exoskeleton, it is pretty cool and complicated enough to put aside the obvious faults, such as the vast, exposed body parts of the hero which cause him problems to no end. A review should be air and I gave a star for the effects, one for the hero, and another for the creation of a city that truly filled me with a desire to die LONG before it becomes reality. Two stars were lost for the lack of science adhesion, worn out story line (hero loves woman-woman rejects hero-hero gets woman), and the fact our unstoppable hero is the only one with any acting chops whatsoever. Enjoyable the second time around since the defects can be overlooked a lot easier. Three times is the charm.

5914415,1,B00EHK2S04,"Karl Marx, La Raza, and Obamacare (ACA) would be proud. The agenda in this subterfuge is hardly veiled. The global elite cannot be pleased (unless this is purposeful desensitization), as this may be more future fact than fiction. They need sanctuary from a poisoned planet of their own making. To what terra firma will they flee?

The film starts out with some promise, then deteriorates into a silly and absurd parody of so many mindless action flicks. Unlike a generic 'actioner', it aggressively pushes progressive political, social, and economic philosophies.  Jodie Foster looks oddly uncomfortable in her role. Damon is obviously in his element, as is Alice Braga. Did they need to be paid for this propaganda? Confusing, as Hollywood is part of the global elite. Are they unconsciously self destructive? Or are we being inured to our eventual servitude/serfdom in a radiologically/toxicologically ravaged planet?

Damon's obsession w/the Communist Revolutionaries in South Africa, as well as a false premise that people of primarily European decent live some sort of dreamy garden of Eden life requiring the heartless subjugation of all others both foreign & domestic is perhaps due the cocoon within which he lives.

AMERICANS continue to lose jobs, liberty, disposable income and a continual attack on the Bill of Rights, the 1st Ten Amendments, none more important than the other yet were it not for the insistence of GW & a few others the majority of framers couldn't perceive a State such that the Bill of Rights would be such a necessary protection for the people.

The United States has long aided the downtrodden and defenseless, whether via government or private citizen donations of time, skill and money.  We have gone to war to win freedom & Liberty. Damon & this movie, proponents of amnesty for illegal immigrants.

Worse still, on the issue of Marxist Latino illegal aliens, Eliseo Medina, a top ""immigration enthusiast"", admits both Democratic Socialist of America & SEIU desire & won a supreme court decision so their proof of citizenship cannot be required.

By contrast, were this a documentary of sorts, Elysium's citizens would steadily be bleed dry of Liberty to the benefit of all others.

There are forces at work in the world intent on oppressing people but it is not, was not the US.

Having said all this, the South African logo on the Evil Elysium Spaceship at one point was a pathetic reminder of Damon's psychosis.

5914465,3,B00EHK2S04,"Neil Blomkamp's follow up to District 9 is a serviceable disappointment. After the excellent District 9 perhaps it's unfair to draw comparisons, but this film has many similarities without the gritty heart beating underneath District 9. In it, Earth is a dystopian bureaucratic nightmare where everyone is working to death while the upper class lives on Elysium, which is a colony in space where the rich dwell. Right off the start the story/message is contrived, with Matt Damon playing earnest ""joe everyman"" while the evil white collar rich are cold and conniving, helmed by Jody Foster in a very unmemorable role of ""evil business(wo)man"". So the characters are all pretty bland stereotypes, Matt Damon is good ol' hero, his childhood friend is the damsel in distress, and Jody Foster does the whole ""kill poor people so the investors are happy"" deal. The only character that was interesting was Sharlto Copley as the ruthless mercenary Kruger that gives Matt Damon a hard time. Hell I would've been way more interested if the movie revolved around adventures of Kruger.

So the similarities to District 9 are abundant throughout the film, with an honest good character (Wikus/Matt Damon) who's fate abruptly changes for the worse (black goo/radiation poisoning), eventually becomes more powerful through it (prawn strength/robot suit), and tries to reach the deus-ex machina at the end (prawn cure/radiation cure), meanwhile shooting people all the way through who are led by a ruthless leader (Koobus/Kruger). Again, the action is well done and engaging, but everything else that worked in District 9 fell flat here. There's no connection to Matt Damon here like there was for Wikus in District 9 because his character is just so bland, he's even prophesied by a nun in the begin to do ""great things"". The prawns were a fascinatingly original allegory to the lower class, while Elysium's class parallels are blatant and stale.

Part of the problem I think is having stars in this. Both Matt Damon and Jody Foster play their roles mechanically, and it makes me think Matt Damon is the star because the film's investors need a star to draw in box office attendance, instead of hiring someone who fits the role. The writing also carries some blame, since all we know about this character is that he likes staying alive & fulfilling promises to childhood friends. He's not a dorky paper pusher that Wikus was. Jody Foster as well, who has 0 humanity in her character leaves much unfulfilled, and leads to a problem with films like Elysium or Avatar, that if they want to be taken seriously, they need to humanize the villains and show you their perspective. Instead these movies are insultingly simplistic in that approach, further exacerbated by it making the obvious message the entire focal point of the movie by the third act, instead of dropping breadcrumbs. District 9 did this well by making you side with the humans from the get-go, thinking the aliens were weird bothers that the government were trying to help. Then as the film goes along with Wikus' transformation, we see the government as being the true monsters instead of the actual, monsters. It's a tired message sure, but it was an original perspective in District 9, here the script is so blatant and juvenile that I could see some little kid writing it.

By no means is Elysium a bad film, it's all competently done, but the problem is that it merely stays mediocre and forgettable. The final 5 minutes or so was rushed, cheesy, and convenient. A more interesting movie could've been made after Elysium, where everyone can now go to Elysium (omg spoilers the good guys win!), how it would deal with overpopulation. Now there's an issue people haven't really tackled yet, lets ditch this class-warfare crap and see how a sci-fi film deals with the steadily rising human population, preferabbly starring Shartlo Copley.

tl;dr Elysium is basically District 9, but bigger and dumber.",1388016000,6,3952,4.9652567975830815

Basically, there's disease that cripples the earth, so the rich people build a colony in the planets orbit away from the downtrodden and unfortunate.  On the global surface, life is hard and those horrible wealthy people who don't want to live amongst the population and do everything imaginable to keep them from penetrating their little oasis live in a magnificent utopia where there is no disease, crime or polygamy.  It's what 'The Fresh prince Of Bel Air' taught us about life inside those gates at Uncle Phil's house, really.

This film is really nice aesthetically and that should be commended, and really the only reason it gets anything above Half a Star.

I think the message is pitiful and is but a metaphor what braindead people who don't live in reality really think...and that's sad.  What's sadder is that millions really believe it (the fact they add in the whole Hispanic girl with Leukemia storyline is PRICELESS...and eventually, inevitable for what they're selling).

5914528,2,B00EHK2S04,"The good
------------

Elysium was a visually great movie, with a few decent action scenes.

The rest
-----------

I find it HILARIOUS to be getting this sort of simplistic crap about how ""the rich"" should open their homes and wealth to ""everyone"" from a bunch of millionaires who live in houses with high walls and private security surrounding them. The message would have a LITTLE credibility if Damon & Co. were opening their mansions to the homeless every night.

Essentially, this movie has the economic and political understanding of a two year old. The economics shown simply would not, could not every operate. Well, actually it could - under a communist dictatorship. There is no other set of circumstances that would allow a wealthy elite to continue to pull in wealth from people as poor and jobless as the citizens were.

Oh, and the silliness with those ""med beds"". As portrayed int he movie, these things can cure anything, cost literally nothing to run, consume no raw materials limiting their use and are fully automated. Yet, we are to believe, ""the rich"" keep them entirely to themselves because... well, I gather Damon and friends just figure that ""the rich"" are evil. Not the Hollywood rich, just all the rest of them.

So, they keep the ""med beds"" to themselves, as a result disease on earth is rampant and Elysium is subject to intense hatred and nearly constant terrorist attacks. Does that make sense? nope. No, what would make sense in a world where such a fairy tale technology existed would be for the Elysium folks to simply cure anyone who wants it - for about $100 a shot. They would make HUGE amounts of money, be seen as benefactors and have a thriving, productive Earthly population to both create the goods they need (almost no one on Elysium works, apparently) and it would stop all the terrorism.

But no no says Damon & Co. The rich are far too evil for that.

It's all a fairly 2 dimensions, Occupy Wall Street view of the world... the view of a Hollywood leftist spending oh so much time wringing his hands about the evils of the 1% while he flies off in his private jet to have another fundraiser for people he makes damn sure he never has to spend much time with.

5914537,2,B00EHK2S04,"Do not rent this movie. It is no where as good as District 9. Incredibly simplistic and non-engaging.  Same plot as Independence Day. Get to the ""Mother Ship"" and download a computer application that will ""fix"" everything for the good guys. Also, despite the extreme poverty portrayed you never really feel for the protagonist and for those for whom he is fighting.  And you never get a sense that the ""bad guys"" who live on Elysium are all that powerful. I mean they can only shoot down two ships from a special-ops agent on earth?  Elysium seems to be indefensible from any type of invasion. The films ""enemy"" seems weak, and therefore there is no real sense of struggle for the protagonist.

There are many plot holes, and I don't want to go down the road of naming everything wrong with the film. One of the major flaws to me is that you have pretend all governments have disbanded their military and police forces and only robots police the world. Even though many robots appear to be manufactured, only a few actually show up in the movie.

This movie would have been way better, if Elysium was actually part of bigger system of space stations built for the rich and military forces that defended it. And if the disavowed agents, who were plotting their own coup, had actually teamed up with Matt and his team to go up a much larger and stronger  military complex.

5914555,3,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium is the name for a wheel-shaped space station on which 22nd century rich people live in luxury.  Meanwhile, billions of teeming poor live lives of squalor on an ugly, dilapidated Earth.  This is the premise of the newest addition to the dystopian variety of science fiction films dating back to Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, et cetera.

The quality of the visuals is strong.  Admirers of the South African director's earlier District 9 will find much that is familiar in this film. The vast slums of Mexico City serve as the slums of future Los Angeles.  Inevitably, there is a South African flavor here; the film's thuggish hit man had a thick Afrikaner accent.  Jodie Foster, who plays the effete villain, seems to affect one as well; it's hard to tell, since her labored accent fades in and out.  The visuals for the space station are breathtaking, depending in part on legendary visualist Syd Mead's work.

Unfortunately, there are problems.  The protagonist, played by Matt Damon, seems like the only Northern European American on Earth.  Since he is cast as the savior for the largely Hispanic proletariat, there is the sense that salvation must come from The White Guy - again.  It also doesn't feel right that none of the Earthbound poor give Damon's character a hard time because of his race.  It's obvious that one reason that the poor remain poor - and the middle class is becoming poor - is its penchant for turning against itself along racial and other factional lines.

There is also the strong impression that the story is propelled by what film makers call a ""McGuffin:"" a piece of gee whiz technology that everybody must have.  In this case, it is a medical bed that can cure anything within seconds - from terminal illnesses to having one's head blasted to a shred of pulp by a hand grenade.  Its reference to the current health care debate is heavy handed, and the technology seems too advanced - even for 22nd century Earth.  Another bit of technology holds out the hope that if one plugs it in and turns it on, society's evils will be solved - a far too convenient plot device that trivializes the social problems of our time.

A pulped head is but one example of the film's greatest flaw; excessive violence and gore.  There are many who would like to see this film for its social commentary, but will recoil at about the ten-minute mark due to its rising tide of aggression and bloodshed.  Foul language - almost compulsory for the under-thirty crowd, is also a big turn-off for the remaining clean-mouthed members of the audience.

Though the cast is strong, none of the actors give their best effort here.  Jodie Foster hits the right emotional tone for her character, but has trouble with her accent.  Matt Damon's performance feels phoned in; his reactions to his terminal condition are as unconvincing as his ultimate self-sacrifice.  His version of the ""It's a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before"" speech is unworthy of one tear.

If I were to use another McGuffin - a time machine - to advise the director before he began his work, I would have advised him to avoid the trap of an easy (gadget-driven) solution.  Can you imagine an ending for Soylent Green in which a dying Charlton Heston croaked:  ""Soylent Green is people!  Wait... Hey, everybody, if I open this door with my magic key, there's a warehouse of decent food!""  Add a string of ugly invectives and a few squibs and you have Elysium.",1387843200,3,3460,4.674380165289256

5914561,3,B00EHK2S04,"The story is re-hashed. The visuals were amusing but very basic in fundamental science. In-fact, the amount of Sci-fi that was put into this film was equivalent to what you see in a high school themed play. I write Sci-fi and I was impressed by the medical science fiction in play but extremely disappointed with the military technology in play. Seriously, the technology that was used for military application is something we already have. It was like watching a low budget Iron Man. If you going to go with a science fiction movie where the ""world went to hell"" but the rich citizens built a eutopia in space, at least make the military technology far more sophisticated. Also, explain the ending way better because using the brain as a data storage unit is not something that will likely cause death but it would induce a coma. Our brain runs on electrical pathways, data is just one part of the brain.

5914563,5,B00EHK2S04,"When watching a science fiction, I think one thing that is required, is that it has to be plausible, to some believable degree.
I find the plot of this movie fits that requirement. The extreme wealthy separating themselves from the common masses, using the citizens for factory labor to produce, while they live in a totally separated, sanitized and protected environment, is not at all beyond belief.
The scenario has existed for thousands of years, as it does in many places today, in some form, only this movie takes it to an extreme for the future, with the privileged living in a huge space station, while the commoner is confined to a filthy and diseased existence of hard labor, policed by robots, without sympathy or sensitivity to their needs from their rulers.
There is some gore and very real looking effects, which is just part of an action movie like this, but the suspense kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the movie, which is what I look for in a plot.
Not everyone would enjoy this movie.  If you like hard action adventure in a science fiction, with a plot that is believable enough not to be a distraction, then this movie will be very entertaining.",1387756800,3,1175,4.62200956937799
5914564,1,B00EHK2S04,"The idea of an orbiting utopia around a distopian Earth is at the outset a strain of the imagination.

For some reason the Earth is full of disease and detritus, and only the wealthy can live on Elysium, a utopia-style orbiting space station that is able generate its own gravity and atmosphere.  The space station is so enormous that people can live there with swimming pools, manicured lawns, etc.  Finally the most incredible part is the advancement of medicine where seemingly impossible diseases and afflictions are instantly curable.

This medical miracle is available only for the citizens of Elysium and not for ""those"" scum that are still living on Earth.

Jodie Foster plays a ""senator"" type in some kind of strange political environment where she wants to stage a coup d'etat for the only apparent reason that the president doesn't want to shoot down illegal immigrants trying to ""land"" on Elysium from Earth.

One wonders how and why there are ships able to take off when they have so much superior technology.

Mat Damon plays the unwitting hero Max Da Costa.  Before his hero-dome, we see the director's brief effort to build depth to Damon's character which for some reason is growing up with a nun (are we to believe Catholicism is still alive and well by 2154! I truly believe that in order for our civilization to be capable of building such a device we'd abandoned religion but I digress).  Damon's character and a girl grow together and build a dream to go to Elysium.

For some reason, Max becomes a car thief and bad boy and thus grows up apparently we catch up to him when he's been paroled.  Because he makes a joke with a robocop it takes out a baton and cracks his arm breaking it (why does a robot need a baton?  why not grab his arm and break it in two like a twig...robocops are strong!)

He hurts his arm and finds himself being treated by his long lost childhood friend who happens to be a nurse (whose child has leukemia.

The cure is only available on the ""medical"" bay (a bed with a magic wand) which is only available on Elysium and only available to citizens of Elysium (apparently your health and DNA are instantly detectable in real-time). Ah the plot, wink, wink, thickens!

I am already sick of writing the review of this garbage of a movie, so I will just say that there is zero character development and the editing and visuals are just as bad.  Even Jodie Foster wasn't believable.

What's up with Jodie Foster agreeing to be in this movie!?  I am dumbfounded.

Suffice it to say I've warned you not to watch this movie.",1387756800,4,2563,4.581140350877193
5914565,2,B00EHK2S04,"In Elysium, Los Angeles looks like a dingy Central American city, with unpaved roads, loud music blaring from dilapidated buildings and mestizos loitering everywhere. There is no explanation of why Los Angeles is impoverished and Elysium (the space station the LA denizens try to sneak into) is wealthy. The movie synopsis mentions ""pollution"" and LA is indeed polluted, but not just environmentally. The future Los Angeles is polluted demographically with defective people.

The movie is an allegory for illegal immigration. The people on Elysium live in a nice, civilized place (like the people in first-world countries), while the people in Los Angeles live savagely and irresponsibly (like the people from third-world countries who illegally enter first-world countries). And like today's third-world refuse, the people of Los Angeles make no effort to transform their own situation. They simply observe that life is better on Elysium and try to sneak aboard to take advantage of its resources. Well, what would happen if everyone in LA could enter Elysium with no problem? That's where the movie leaves off. There is no epilogue to describe what life is like on Elysium in the years after ""amnesty"" has been granted.

When the guy who helps Matt Damon's character break into Elysium reprograms the ship's computers, everyone in LA is instantly given access to Elysium. The original people of Elysium are no longer ""privileged"" to live there. But this is surely going to transfer LA's problems to Elysium. The ship has limited resources and LA has untold millions of people. Elysium is a nicer place than LA (it is unpolluted), so the people of LA will want to live there. Elysium was designed to house the pre-amnesty population, not the population of Los Angeles, so there will be overcrowding. And what will people do while they're waiting to be housed?

I suppose if Elysium wound up like LA in 2154--run-down and overcrowded--it would be a perverse form of justice to the filmmakers because they think the people of Elysium don't deserve to live that way. That seems to be the film's idiotic message. The film's message is that everyone deserves to live in poverty, which is stupid.",1387756800,8,2191,5.06371191135734

5914567,2,B00EHK2S04,"Watching this movie affirmed that I had made the right decision in choosing to skip this movie in the theater. Overly ideological movies generally overstate their cause and oversimplify the message. Hollywood makes unbelievable movies, but I am continually shocked at how horribly big ticket movies are written.

The acting was wonderful for an action movie aside from Jody Foster who was terrible. The special effects and cinematography was creative and smart. The question that comes to my mind is why not spend more money on some scriptwriters? Patch the glaring holes that have been stated in previous reviews. The movie simply looks like it has taken place in Mexico City - If I was of Hispanic origin, I may be a little offended by the fact everyone is either Spanish or Mexican. If I was a xenophobe this movie would have just re-affirmed my beliefs.

This movie is terrible. Why would a space station have the ability to cure all the sick on earth? Why wouldn't the advancements in management be applied in the future as it is today? Such as understanding the value of human capital, or the use of finite resources.  If curing the worlds problems was as simple as providing aid, much of what the United States and NATO  already spend Billions attempting each year, would not these future citizens do the same?

If the directors had brought in a few political experts and some outside writers this movie would have easily been very enjoyable. This just goes to show that no amount of money can cure a rotten core. Perhaps that is the greatest lesson learned from watching this movie - it's not always about the haves and have nots, its simply a matter of human error that not even money can solve.",1387756800,4,1704,4.704697986577181

5914579,1,B00EHK2S04,"The producers say the year is 2154, but it looks more like 2013.  Two classes of humans exist in the world...the rich (mostly white) and the poor (mostly Latino).  The very wealthy white folks live on Elysium, a beautiful space station orbiting earth, and the very poor Hispanics and white convicts struggle to carve an existence on an apocalyptic-like earth.  This is the basic plot they give you and then the rest of the movie is dedicated to how the Latinos try to obtain the same lifestyle and affordable health care (Obama care) the Elysium citizens have on the space station.

How do they go about it?  Hopping aboard broken-down space shuttles and trying to make a ""run for the orbital borders"" of Elysium.  However, this only gets them shot down.  Enter Matt Damon, an ex-con, who works for a robotic-cop manufacturing company.  One morning at work, he is exposed to a near fatal dosage of radiation, but since he is not a ""citizen"" of Elysium, he cannot receive their life-saving treatments.  Matt, who will die in five days, makes a bargain with one of earth's smartest hackers to kidnap a high-ranking, Elysium politician visiting earth, and download all of the man's cyber secrets into his own brain.  Of course, Matt has to become strong and cybernetic before he can achieve this feat, which involves them jamming metallic parts all throughout his brain and spinal cord.  The rest, including Jodie Foster's character is not even worth talking about.

I loved the special effects, which was only about two percent of the movie.  Strangely, one thing I kept wondering about throughout the entire film was the lack of minorities, the black women, the Asians, the East Indians, etc.  The only ethnic group represented in the film are the poor Hispanics.  Although, at the very end of the movie, they do show happy, dark-skinned Africans running freely in the ""wind"" towards freedom.

Sadly, whether intentional, or not, there is a visible ""racist"" theme woven throughout the entire film.

5914580,4,B00EHK2S04,"Yeah, the film cannot hide its message draped in science fiction.  Who cares?  Why is that a bad thing?  1984 by Orwell doesn't either, but it's a classic, thought-provoking story.  And, like this film, its message actually applies.  It's an admonition.

Here's the thing: the rich have reserved all of the best facilities, security, property, amenities, and  . . . the entire government.  They guard it with deadly force.  They horde it with alacrity.

No, I am not describing modern America.  I am giving you the setting in which this movie's main character operates.  Those who have, have everything.  Those without are desperately trying to get what they need.  In particular, the cruelty of this future world is that medical options are only given to the rich who live in space.

By the way, the rich are mostly white and the president is Indian.  The poor are mostly Hispanic and . . . Matt Damon.  Well, there are whites and blacks too, but you'll see an obvious racial ratio that might be meant as another overt message about today's immigration battles.

Still, the movie is a quick-paced action film with a lot of heart.  Quite a few times you wonder how the main character is going to survive.  The story is about the human struggle that we still have not progressed beyond--our inability to SHARE like mommy taught us and live for the greater good FIRST.

The hero is an unlikely, unwilling participant thrown into a struggle for his life.  Soon it is a struggle for others' lives.  It is a tale of violence and sacrifice worth watching at least once.  Plus it has some really cool sci-fi tech and effects!  The robots are kind of scary.

The first have of the movie is spent giving you Damon's character's back story which is not essential to the development of the plot, or at least not all of it is necessary.

SPOILERS

The wealthy Haves, who are mostly Caucasion, live in a space station called Elysium where everything is perfectly manicured and beautiful. Their selfish and cruel representative is played by Jodie Foster.

The poor Have-Nots, who seem to be Hispanic, except for Matt Damon (he's the one white dude in a sea of brown) live on polluted, crowded earth where everything is ugly and decomposing.

The Haves are all uncaring, two dimensional characters who hoard their stuff, including medi-chambers that can cure any illness. Any attempt by the Have-Nots to get to Elysium is met by lethal force, even kids don't get a pass.

And the Haves don't have any charitable organizations that help out the Have-Nots, which means humans have really changed by the year 2154.

In standard Hollywood fashion, our hero, played by Matt Damon, saves the entire planet of Have-Nots singlehandedly. He tricks the computer that controls everything into making them all citizens of Elysium---after fighting with a bunch of evil-doers, of course.

So I guess the message Hollywood wants us to take away from this film is that we should just let in any illegal immigrants and make them all citizens---and if we don't we're just evil and greedy.",1387756800,46,1383,5.0394736842105265

But it's not just a movie, it's Jewish propaganda of the same vein as the jews who have taken over western countries have been inundating us with for 50 years now.

The film shows us white Matt Damon conformed to the majority mestizo culture he's been surrounded with to the point he's just as much or more mestizo than White.  Next, the metaphor of Elysium is clumsy and bald as you'd expect from a hack writer, and the gist is that all the races of the earth are entitled to live in the more prosperous nations, ignoring there are people already living there, and that perhaps those nations are prosperous because of something inherent in those people. You'll notice that the Jewish, white-people-destroying propaganda that is disguised as a film called Elysium, never goes anywhere near why Elysium might be wealthier, why it might have high technology, but rather it's presented to us as just some kind of random accident, and so everyone is entitled to it.

Further, the film's conclusion with Elysium being forced into taking in everyone on earth is presented as if that is no big deal and has no practical obstacles. You'll notice the deliberate point of showing poor Africans running for the shuttles to Europe, oh I mean ""ELYSIUM"".

I felt like the only person we knew anything about was Matt Damons character and honestly it was superficial at best. Uneducated orphan boy who day dreams with an orphan girl, who is educated(why her and not him?), about the good life up on Elysium. Both kids, and others, raised by the prophetic Mexican nun whose words are always profound and perspective changing.
Later in life, the boy is Matt Damon and the girl is some semi-attractive single mom that seems to not want anything to do with him. And not like hard to get, like she just thinks Damon is a sleazy d-bag criminal and will only see him if hes been stabbed by a futuristic rogue Navy SEAL guy or if he begs, like pathetic begs..but only for coffee.
Oh ya, never in any of the numerous flyovers of present day 2154 Los Angeles did I see anything that looked remotely like a Starbucks..or a coffee shop..or a straight up store of any kind. Looked more like the slums of that movie with the prawn aliens stuck in the south african apartheid.
At some point during the movie Matt Damon gets fatally blasted with radiation and has 5 days to liveaccording to an extremely advanced version of Siri that somehow speaks and produces holographic displays literally EVERYWHERE!! Figure it out Apple! The solution? Convince your hacker, stoner, tweeker, robin hood/criminal friends to implant a hydraulic exoskeleton/supercomputer to you spine and nervous system only to bum-rush the year 2154 Elysium Bill Gates when he lands on earth in his Bentley space car just to download information from his brain. Of course, everything goes wrong, but actually goes right and during this scene we become awesomely acquainted with to the character that saved this movie from the flop list. The rogue-futuristic-SEAL-Delta Force character was awesome and should be brought back to life, again, to have his own movie where he battles the futuristic prawn aliens from District 9..even though he turned into a prawn in that movie.

Those with wealth and means have escaped the planetary bounds to live in an artificial ring-world habitat called Elysium in orbit about the planet.  As the story unfolds, it soon becomes clear that those who live in Elysium are in power and have the best that modern science and technology has to offer to support their lives, while the masses on Earth live in squalor in a police-state society.

Damon's character is a factory worker with a criminal past that is just scraping by when misfortune enters his life.  The only way out for him is to reach Elysium, but citizens from Earth are apparently almost never allowed to go there.  His journey to try to get there requires desperate measures that set up an action-driven plotline laced with elements of drama and a bit of political intrigue.

I love both the look and intensity of this film.  Neil Blomkamp shows us a future that is technologically-advanced in a plausible way  , but that also contains some sobering and somewhat terrifying elements.  The story is accessible and easy to relate to without unnecessary complication, and yet the society we are shown has a depth and complexity that makes it compelling and all too real.  Although we are not given much of the history that leads to this future, it is not hard to extrapolate from certain elements of current human society and accept this as one plausible outcome.

I would have loved to have spent more time being immersed in this world, but what's there is a self-contained story that should leave most viewers satisfied with time well spent.  Our solace for having to leave is that Blomkamp is still early in his career as a writer and director, and we can hope to see much more of his creativity and storytelling in years to come.",1387584000,3,2117,4.732970027247957

5914638,3,B00EHK2S04,"Well Earth has gone to los peros as signified by everyone now speaking Spanish, living in a trash strewn graffiti laden environment reeking of taco smoke and who is either an unemployed car thief or employed on the line building the robots that mercilessly enslave them.  And up in the sky is Elysium where they speak French, drink champagne and where Jody Foster is a Defense Minister whose first act in the movie is to take out the illegals trying to, oh please, immigrate illegally to Elysium using special, you guessed it, Homeland Security agents who fire missiles at the illegal shuttles which aside from carrying multicultural illegals are also strewn with trash which floats about the gravity free cabin while the sweating multicultural illegals pray and cry because thats what people do when they're fleeing towards something.  Throw in Matt Damon and lets call him Max as the poor put upon worker with a criminal past and who, as a victim of big business, is given a choice to either enter the radioactive chamber to push a button, because apparently even robots rate higher on the socioeconomic ladder than actual people.  Sure.  All that is really just the backdrop so a CEO from Elysium who has to mingle with the masses in his factory gets to remind one of the lesser beings not to breathe on him.  Yawn.  Ok, were almost done with the clichs but not quite.  Jodie gets in trouble for shooting down the illegals and gets to ask the President if he has children.  Youd think shed know the answer to that.  He only says no so she has an opportunity to use the old, well if you did then you wouldnt second guess my methods to protect what we have built here.  Sound familiar?  Im already suspecting she didn't actually build that although she may have purchased the labor of those who did but like any them vs us, the them seem to not understand that paying for something is not the same thing as building something.  But I digress.  Im 32 minutes into this movie and I already know how its going to end.  Sure theres a love interest who happens to have a child with an illness.  And our newly radioactive hero who has just moments to live and a black market way to get them both up to Elysium for a cure.  Yeah cuz that will work.

I must say Jodie Foster is sexy and alluring as a business mom with a bad French accent who wants to rule the world by engineering a coup.  Meanwhile back on Earth our hero goes through a chop shop op to, oh I don't know, become a borg.  Ok, so theres nothing conspicuous about that, hes going to just fit right in.  Its also comforting to know in 2150-something thugs still wear do rags.  You know its not going to end well for anyone but did you know the code for bad spy is an English accent?  Well now you do.  You can also feel comfort in the knowledge sophisticated defense robots have the same bad aim as human bad guys when they're firing at the good guy.  Dont make Max mad or hell be a, wait for it, Mad Max.  Sigh.  So lets recap.  Useless diseased masses speak Spanish, evil spy hit men speak Cockney and elites, even those named Patel, wield bad French accents.

When all else fails call out the drones.  And at one point they do just that.  Weve already stopped caring what data Max is carrying that now makes him a target but that usually happens when a script is written to support action sequences rather than plot.  Have I mentioned how flawlessly perfect Jodie Foster is with designer hair, clothes and bad French accent?  So Max now has Elysiums operating system stored in his head so he could, theoretically, control Elysium.  Of course any space engineers capable of building such a world would never ever have a back up on, say a thumb drive, because if they did that would kind of make the whole movie pointless.  But Max thinks he can save the world by unlocking Elysium for everyone.

I suppose the fact Elysium is a giant wheel and in spite of having no roof manages to retain atmosphere is one continuity issue too many but apparently hospitals are also no longer necessary because every home has a healing machine, I suppose to handle the daily terminal diseases the inhabitants rarely need.  Its simply a wonder of Imagineering that they seem to be placed near the kitchen because, well, who knows why?  Does it even matter?  We know were going to see the whole thing coming down in figurative flames at the end after the first five minutes because no clich is wasted on this bloody, violent excuse for a film.  And with one computer entry  earth population-legal - Mad Max saves the world  and no one, absolutely no one, has the computer hackem sackem stuff to stop the upload that reoots Elysium and makes it free for everyone.  How socialist.  This was a horrible movie that probably felt good making because it feeds the poor, downtrodden couch potatoes the lie that a fair society is possible.  And yes the dialect coach got an undeserved credit at the end as did Seasons Fine Foods catering.  Im so glad I waited til it was $4.99  to rent as I was tempted on several occasions to pay the $12.99 because I really do love sci-fi but this was just sigh-fi.",1387584000,23,5133,4.470967741935484

How much was spent on this stinker? The best thing we as consumers can do is send a message to the makers of this shlock. Best way; ensure they don't recoup. I rented it. Please do the same before you buy. Read the other negative reviews and take heed. Kudos to you other reviewers for nailing it on how bad this movie is;

-NO character development. Not needed given fact that most were bad; the acting alone allowed us to hate them.
-Completely ridiculous juxtaposition ('poor' crusaders using millions in tech to fight the evil rich)
-Some of the rich on Elysium are apparently never home. This provided easy access to the med miracle beds within by any 'illegal' that could break a glass entry door... wtf? Maybe they're all vacationing on the uninhabited Mexican Riviera. The movie has all the poor Hispanics in the world living in LA slums :/
-Absurd political agenda. Search 'Obama Care' within these reviews. There is an ominously similar undertone here. Wow, believe the fantasy of this movie and apparently communism is still sought in the distant future.
-Poor acting from all involved. This is shameful given the caliber of talent here.
-The ridiculous script; ""They will hunt you to the edge of the earth for this"". Prompted from viewing hacked computer code for 4 seconds!
-Did I mention the locket containing a picture of earth taken from space? ""Don't forget where you come from""....geeez! Or should I say cheese?",1387584000,8,1699,4.855172413793103

Not only that, the performances and dialogue are bad.  Making the movie almost unwatchable.  I feel this movie was a big let down.  The main performances were not good at all.

Matt Damon isn't bad, but he really wasn't given much to work with as far as a script goes.

5914646,3,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium is a decent movie, but it could have been much better.  Elysium is directed by Neill Blomkamp, the same person who directed District 9.  I personally thought that Elysium was a bit of a step down from District 9.  It has great effects, good action, and a great main villain.  However, the characters besides the villain I thought were a bit bland and the acting felt phoned in sometimes.  Plus I did not find the film very enjoyable, at least until the final act.

The effects for the film are great.  The effects here are on par with District 9.  The film has a very similar look to it as District 9, which is not surprising since it is the same director.  I like all the technology employed here.  The action scenes are good particularly the fight between Matt Damons character and the villain played by Sharlto Copley.  The score was decent as well.

The villain, Kruger, is a great villain.  Sharlto Copley proves that he has great range as an actor.  He seemed like one of the only characters that had any energy or passion.  He is definitely the best part of the film.

However, the film has many issues.  The main characters, sad to say, were not very memorable.  Matt Damon is okay in the role.  However, the problem is that he is just okay.  There is nothing that stands out in his performance, and there is no energy to it a lot of the time.  I think that anybody could have played Damons role.  His character is more realistic and I did buy his plight, but I just did not find him very engaging.  Alice Braga and the little girl were quite bland as well.

Jody Foster plays the secondary villain of the movie.  Foster does fin performance wise but I found her character very one-dimensional.  She is even a very fun villain like Copley is in this.  William Fichtner is also in the film.  However, he really has a nothing role and his character gets killed halfway through the film.  He is basically just a plot device.  Any actor could have that role.

Another big issue I have with the film is the obvious message.  This film tries to hammer home the message of don't pollute the environment.  It is a good but, like with Avatar, we have seen this message being conveyed in tons of other movies.  I do not mind films having big messages, but Id wish they would find a new way of telling it.  Ive seen the same message conveyed better in films like Wall-E, which is very similar to Elysium.

On top of all that the film is not that enjoyable to watch, in my opinion.  It is not a bad film.  It is actually a pretty decent movie.  However, it is not a film I would re-watch.  I have the same problem with District 9.  District 9 is a good movie, but it is not something I would watch again.  I think it mostly has to do with the look of the look of both films.  Both movies have a very bleak and dirty look to them.  The world that is depicted in these two films is not very fun to look at.  I understand that that was the point, but I still do not care for the look of these films.  It is too depressing for my taste.

Overall, Elysium is a decent film and is worth at least one viewing.  I also think it is worth seeing in theatres if you have the chance, but I would see at matinee price.",1387584000,3,3209,4.235099337748345

Matt Damon!
Science Fiction!
That director guy who made District 9.
What could go wrong? Well, pretty much everything and the responsibility has to be laid at the feet of Blomkamp who must wipe his shoes clean before being allowed to direct again. Anyone who can make Jodie Foster a shrill one note actor deserves an Academy UnAward for inept direction and possibly another one for script participation.
Aside from some special effects (and some not so special- the long shots of space travel from earth to Elysium look like they haven't progressed much beyond 2001), there's not much to see here and nothing to learn. Mr. Blomkamp has definite ideas about immigration and the overall unfairness of the world (there's a new concept worth exploring) but seems unable to deliver his messages without teaching to the kid in the corner wearing the dunce hat.
More troubling is an undercurrent of racism . Elysium seems to consist of white people with a Pakistani or Indian and the occasional black thrown in. Earth on the other hand is overpopulated with Hispanics and other non- lilywhite ethnics who, as one reviewer noted, can read laptop code faster than a computer chip, handle heavy weapons and still find time to get elaborate tattoos. Obviously all these people need is a chance, a magic all healing hospital bed and a white man to lead them. Enter Matt  Damon in the ""Dancing With Wolves"" role. If he's not quite believable and seems vaguely uncomfortable in the role, you can blame both the script and the direction. I never thought of him as an action hero until the Bourne movies but he pulled it off admirably. Here, he's unconvincing as a self absorbed anti-hero no matter how many mechanical implants he has embedded in his brain and nervous system. Unconvincing doesn't even describe what Jodie Foster is in this movie. She looks good and all positives end there.
I was intrigued when I read that part of this movie was filmed in the sprawling garbage dump for Mexico City. A world unto itself, it has it's own population of people and animals who find housing, subsistence and labor on the crap that people throw away. You don't see much of that in the film. By the credits, you don't see much of anything worth remembering.

I love the special effects.  They are getting to the point where is it very difficult to pick them out.

Ok with that out of the way.  Let's talk about the bad.
Not entertaining
Why?
1.  Poor character motivation/development (as in nearly zero)
Max - criminal gone straight, but very selfish, doesn't do what's right until he pretty much has no choice, so what the heck I'll be the hero.
2.  Unrealistic 1 dimensional characters (straw men and standard clich Hollywood archetypes) at least 1 character needs to be relatable else all we are seeing is a bunch of people moving around saying stuff.
Mother with dying child with a disease that is highly survivable these days (those mean rich people!)
Everyone is dirty and poor (because of those mean rich people)
Police are nothing but bullies and mean and brutal even though they are robots (again those rich people)
Criminals are just misunderstood, but are really good (probably the rich people's fault too)
Rich are greedy and hate everyone or are useless sheep (that some how became rich even though they are really stupid, so they don't deserve it) (what is with those rich people?)

3.  Unrealistic social construct. Everyone is living in a giant slum.  So who is actually feeding them?  They just spend all their time being lazy, committing crimes, getting tattoos, and making babies (because of the rich people probably).  So you are telling me there are no condoms or birth control in the future?  I would think if the rich were that mean they would have mandated sterilizations using their evil cop robots.  I guess because they are extra mean rich people they'd rather see some of the nicest places on Earth become giant dirty slums if it means lifting a finger to help dirty poor people.

4.  Unrealistic plot pacing.  5 days to live.  In that time we are going to organize and plan a kidnapping, conduct major surgery implanting cybernetic components as well as brain implants, get the data, fly to orbit, take over the space station, and save everyone?  Sure they will.

5.  Unrealistic plot points.  Ok so let me get this straight.  The mean rich people have a button they can push that keeps all the shuttles grounded from LA, but yet they let anyone just fly up so they can shoot them down with an ""illegal"" sleeper agent, huh?  or have large enough numbers of illegals that requires dedicated massive holding cages and a big space buss with ""deportation"" painted on the side.  Oh wait that's right they are mean!

They also have this magic box that will keep you young and perfect that obviously can work miracles in 5 minutes and require no resources to work and there isn't a SINGLE person anywhere that can afford one and be willing to go take it down to Earth to help all the poor people.  Wow really?  Last time I checked there is a whole industry in the present right now funded by and run by rich people that do that continuously.  Oh wait again I forgot, all rich people are mean.  So in the future they wouldn't ever do that.

6.  Unrealistic hardware depicture
Let me get this straight criminals sit around all day drinking and slappin their ho's and just happen to have advance networked tech, medical tech, cybernetic tech, weapons tech, earth to orbit shuttles, and plenty of cash to burn on the before mentioned booze and ho's and a ridiculous number of tats, but yet their fearless leader walks around with a limp and none of them can be bothered to take care of the needy poor people, or at least round up a few people to clean all the trash out of their shuttles before they launch them, or much less off the street, or maybe say install a window AC unit so they could be a little less sweaty?

Summary
If the goal of the movie was insult your intelligence, depict a certain group in society as mean, selfish, sadomasochists that like to kick puppies and to all around suck, then by all means it's 5 stars.  If the goal was to be entertained it is a negative 2.",1387497600,52,3983,4.566197183098591

5914668,4,B00EHK2S04,"Full review at Metal Arcade. Net

Neill Blomkamps 2009 film District 9 was an interesting sci-fi action flick that dealt with the issue of racism. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, and Blomkamp is out to prove that that film was no fluke, delivering another very solid summer blockbuster with Elysium. The film packs Hollywood star power like Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and William Fichter, while bringing his buddy and District 9 star Sharlto Copley along for the ride as well.

Elysium once again deals with societal issues, this time namely overpopulation, poverty and immigration. In the year 2154, planet Earth is in ruin. Its inhabitants face a harsh climate, crime, and oppression, while the wealthiest humans live on a glamorous space station called Elysium  protected by robots and home to magic medical bays that can heal even the most serious of ailments in seconds. The people of Earth are willing to risk all to make it into Elysium by any means necessary. Its an intelligent action film that demands a multifaceted actor like Matt Damon, who does some of his strongest work in his role as Max. Max is a poor citizen just trying to make his way on the forsaken Earth, when circumstances suddenly and drastically affect him, leaving a near-suicidal trip to Elysium his only option. While Max starts off as a morally ambiguous character, his story arc will see him making a stand for all of Earths citizens.

While Matt Damons Max is an interesting and engaging anti-hero, Sharlto Copleys mercenary Kruger threatens to steal the show. Jodie Foster is capable as the evil Secretary Delacourt, who intends to make a coup against the liberal government on Elysium. Delacourts plan is set into action with the help of Fichters John Carlyle, a businessman whos made his billions off of the hard labor of Earths people, Max included. Diego Luna is solid as Maxs best friend Julio, who is willing to do whatever it takes to save his life-long buddy. The rest of the cast is decent, but forgettable.

Elysiums DVD release features two behind-the-scenes extras, pared down from the Blu-rays features but still worth a look. Engineering Utopia: Creating a Society in the Sky showcases the incredible talent at work to bring Elysium to the big screen in such a visually captivating fashion, with looks at concept artwork and early renderings as well as interviews with the artists. Collaboration: Crafting the Performances in Elysium interviews the films actors, and shows some funny on-set moments.

While Elysium is perhaps a bit too grim of a story, and could have easily benefited from a bit more levity in the proceedings, overall Neill Blomkamps sophomore effort is a strong one. With plenty of exciting action, an intriguing story and stellar acting from Damon and Copley, this is a film no sci-fi buff will want to miss.",1387497600,2,2847,4.908523908523908

First off why would they keep sending shuttles to Elysium if they only got shot down? And with powerful droids and state of the art technology why was the resistance even in operation? They could have been stomped out in a five minute raid.

I'm also a Matt Damon fan and he really didn't talk much during the entire movie. I wanted to get a better feel of what motivated him besides the radiation poisoning. I didn't feel emotionally attached to his character at all.

In the end I gave this three stars and not less because I was entertained for two hours and in that respect the movie succeeds even with the questions I am still asking.",1387497600,3,839,4.365384615384615

5914718,3,B00EHK2S04,"Here we have a wonderfully FX/Tech production for those who love sci-fi technology. I'm one of them.

However, the entire plot is confused. First off, if Elysium can send medical transports to heal Earth's inhabitants, why does it take a catastrophic event to achieve it? They could have made it more realistic by saying that even though Elysium has the resources to heal the sick, they are extorting them, somehow, for their own profit. But, as the last scene shows, that isn't the case, since they do have the resources. So the question posed is, ""Why not heal the Earth people?"" I mean there is no motive to not.

And then we have the underlying theme of ""Everyone has something special to do in life."" Really? Tell that to the factory worker with 30 years on an assembly-line. That's more of a religious conviction to sooth the masses who live mundane and boring lives, to sooth them and to motivate them to get up one more time and put in one more mundane day of work.

And then we have a fairly shallow character development. I never felt close to any of the characters. More importantly, in a movie of this sort, I never felt much contempt for the bad guys. A computer programed with formulaic algorithms could have written the screen play. From a human point of view, it's lazy writing and devoid of innovation or plot twists.

The saving grace of this movie, for sci-fi fans, is that they spared no quarter for tech and FX. Everything looked believable and real. The tech conformed to known physical laws and there wasn't ever a point at which I said, ""Oh right, completely idiotic."" True there is a problem with rotating platforms and gravity, but we're getting closer and closer, even today, at figuring out a way to create artificially gravity, so no problem.

So, there you have it. The plot is as simplistic as this: Bad guy super advanced civilization exploits the masses for its own pleasures. Super-hero saves the day. This receives a big and fat yawn, and 2.5 stars. I gave it the benefit of great technology that conforms to physical laws.

I always like to watch movies more than once because we always tend to miss details the first time around (Which I suggest to anyone) and I was able to see some missed elements each time.

5914721,3,B00EHK2S04,"I rented this on Red Box for $1.61 and was glad, since that is about what this movie was worth. It starts out with so much potential, with Matt Damon in the lead, --plus-- Jodie Foster, Sharlto Copley (District 9, The A-Team) and Alice Braga (I Am Legend, City Of God, Predators) in supporting roles. After an introduction of characters and a strong start, Elysium becomes predictable and at times down right boring.

Matt Damon did what he could with his character, but he had little to work with. Elysium simply left me not caring about our hero, the pathetic masses on Earth, or this movie. Worse yet, I did not hate the bad guys in the least either. That dealt a one--two TKO blow to this movie for me.

Once scene really did get my ire up, where we find that the world we know now, where the police, the judges and the probationary system we have in place in the US, is even more out of control, in this much less inhumane future, administrated by robots. I did find that interesting in a week of tech (mid December 2013) news dominated by Google's acquisition of Boston Dynamics, a robotics,  design and production company.

If the screenwriters had played that angle up more, and pushed the buttons of the feelings of being cattle and sheep we endure every time a cop pulls us over to write us a traffic ticket today; This movie could have succeeded much more highly for me.

The tech left me wanting in so many ways as well. I won't spoil it for you, but REALLY? It is 2154 and the hackers are toting around two inch thick laptops from 1995? You won't have to look far to poke holes in the tech side of this movie, so I will leave the rest of that to you, because it --is-- worth a look.

I gave it 3 stars (it's OK) since this is worth a rental, but not worth owning...",1387324800,2,1778,4.2925373134328355
5914722,4,B00EHK2S04,"In 2154, class hierarchy has asserted itself with a vengeance.  The wealthy, for the most part, live above the earth, in the orbiting habitat Elysium.  A few remain on the surface, overseeing the poor.  Among the millions of disgruntled workers is Max, who due to a worksite injury has received a death sentence.  In order to survive, Max needs to get to Elysium.  His only means: take on a job.  However, he quickly realizes he's in over his head, and now possesses critical data that could save (or doom) everyone on Earth.

ELYSIUM isn't quite as ""important"" as Neil Blomkamp previous effort, DISTRICT 9.  However, it looks and feels much the same, which is actually something of a good thing: DISTRICT 9 became weighted down by its own hubris, while ELYSIUM wholly embraces the action genre.  As previously proven, Matt Damon knows how to do this kind of thing, and does so adequately, though he's out-shined by Sharlto Copely as a psychotic sleeper agent for the government, and Jodie Foster as a senator even more corrupt than the rest of the government.

Ultimately, ELYSIUM doesn't have much to offer besides solid acting and fantastic visual effects.  But that isn't such a bad thing.  There's heart here; not as much of it as you'd want, but you can still see it if you look closely.  It's essentially a B movie trying to be something more, but if you're looking for some nice flashy fun, ELYSIUM has much to offer.",1387324800,3,1425,4.69758064516129

The result is a more traditionally structured film with a predictable (and somewhat flawed) plot, but it's also an exciting, emotionally involving trip into a frighteningly plausible (and vividly realized) future nonetheless. This time, backed by Hollywood support and featuring a more experienced cast, Blomkamp proves that his vision is indeed capable of sustaining a larger-scale story by delivering a carefully balanced mix of social commentary and innovative sci-fi action amidst completely immersive backdrops both down on Earth and up in the stars.",1387324800,2,740,5.798165137614679

 Well they live on a space station above the earth, (Elysium) and they have a magical machine that can cure all illness and injury (but for members only) Well bad guy Matt lives on the dirty, over populated cesspool called earth and arranges, with the help of  an underground friend, to make the trip to cure his radiation poisoning, but his girlfriend's little girl is in the final stages of lukemia and needs the machine too.

Matt manages to avoid their efforts to terminate him and helps the little girl get treated by the magic machine (as do all of earths inhabitants since Matt and company re-programmed Elysiums rules and regs).

My first thoughts at this movie is that it initially reminded me a bit of the old Mad Max or Blade Runner movies with its almost post apocalyptic view of the world in the future. The scenery and special effects are well done and have a bleak realistic feel to it. The movie plot itself starts a bit slowly attempting to develop the character that Damon plays and sometimes tends to be a bit preachy. Although it does start slowly, it gave me enough to keep me interested in watching. Damon does a decent job in the role and Jodie Foster as well does well as the villain in space. The one character that I wish had a different actor was the actor playing Kruger. To me he was more annoying with his accent than villainous. I really think someone else could have better played that role.

Although I think some things kept this from being a higher rated movie as the plot could have been developed a bit more and I think a different actor for Kruger, all in all this is an entertaining film. 3.5 stars",1387238400,3,1261,4.294117647058823

5914739,1,B00EHK2S04,"Let me give you a little synopsis of this movie:

Two classes of people (Class Warfare): Very wealthy (Hollywood-types) and the rest, live on an overpopulated ruined Earth (surely due to Global Warming & not enough Abortions). Anti-immigration (Racist) laws... preserve citizens' luxurious lifestyles (similar to rich Hollywood actors).

Max (Matt Damon), an ""ordinary"" guy (Rich Hollywood-type) and the only man with the chance to bring equality (Wealth Redistribution) to these worlds, has a $15 million dollar mansion in L.A. and a $20 million dollar Miami Beach pad.

I know that actors play many different roles that do not necessarily reflect their own worldviews, but the problem is I know Matt Damon's worldview.  And while his beliefs are actually in line with most of the ideology of this movie, I'm tired of the ultra-rich Hollywood types playing the class-warfare game either in real life or in the movies.  It is the height of hypocrisy.",1387238400,12,950,5.142857142857143

5914741,4,B00EHK2S04,"Of course we've seen the evil rich people villain done to death a million times before but this is an interesting twist on that story.  In this film Max (Matt Damon) who is a former criminal born and raised on a disease ridden, poverty stricken, and overpopulated planet earth swears one day to make it to Elysium.

Elysium is basically a space station where all the rich and privileged humans have migrated to in order to live a life of luxury.  Being waited on hand and foot by robots who are cranked out of factories by people fortunate enough to have a job making them on earth.  They also have machines capable of restoring someone to perfect health even if they are on the brink of death or terminally ill.  After a horrible accident in the robot production factory Max finds himself desperate to get to Elysium no matter what the cost.  He manages to buy his ticket to Elysium by performing a job for an Underground organization led by a criminal mastermind named Spider but in doing so uncovers a plot that will change Elysium and potentially Earth for the worse.

The special effects and gore were pretty impressive along with some interesting performances by Matt Damon, Jodi Foster, and Sharlto Copley.  Most of the other characters seemed like filler for the rest of the film but they did help flesh it out nicely.  I enjoyed this movie quite a bit and rate it 4 out of 5 stars.",1387152000,,1390,4.528

5914743,3,B00EHK2S04,"There are many things to like in ELYSIUM, writer/director Neill Blomkamps follow-up to his critically acclaimed first feature, DISTRICT 9.  This new sci-fi thriller is endowed with a compelling basic premise, good performances from Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and an international cast, impressive visual effects, plus some exciting action sequences.

Set in the year 2154, ELYSIUM presents us with two classes of people: the very wealthy who live on a pristine man-made space station (Elysium), and everybody else who inhabit the overpopulated, ruined Earth.  The evil rich, led by Jodie Foster, want to keep the poor folks off of Elysium where they can be cured of all their ills, and its up to Matt Damon to lead a dangerous mission that might change all that.

I think the pictures problem is that Blomkamp wasn't sure what kind of movie he wanted to make.  The film seems to be part futuristic science fiction, part espionage thriller and, at times, just mindless over-the-top action...with a strong ultra-liberal political statement thrown in for good measure.

As a writer, Blomkamp has created a sometimes confusing new world in which the set rules seem to change on a whim.  For example, when is a dead person really dead?  In Elysium, one can never be sureand were not talking zombies here.

Non-discriminating action fans will definitely enjoy this one.

The dialog is poor and the premise is a stretch to say the very least or left horribly unexplored but what is 4th wall breaking is the main two villains who destroyed the movie. Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley landed way way off their marks'.

Many of the negative reviews seem to point to the fact that the plot was predictable.  Consider that most plots are simply re-telling of tales from the Greeks, the Grimms , Shakespeare and such.  With our insatiable appetite for good stories, it's hard to find a truly original idea for a plot.

I enjoyed this movie.  It was entertaining.  It was NOT the ""Grapes of Wrath"" or ""Hamlet"".  It was just a movie with loud action and lots of stuff getting blown up.  How many re-tellings of ""Die Hard"" will Hollywood come out with?  As long as they are engaging and entertaining, I will still pay to watch them.

I took a couple of ""History of Motion Pictures"" classes when I was in college.  I came to appreciate why things like the ""Potemkin"" were such great and pioneering movies.  Yet, if I want to be entertained, ""Tremors"" is the kind of movie I like to watch.  Or ""Shaun of the Dead""... witty, funny, silly.

5914757,3,B00EHK2S04,"This movie has a somewhat lame story, but it is a decent movie.  If you just get over the intricacies of the stories and silliness of the whole ""health care"" theme, then you can find and enjoyable movie.  Matt Damon plays the main character, a drifter-like individual who lives on the futuristic earth which is now a big sh**hole, akin to the ghettos of a big major city.

I found a qoute online from the director where he stated that the movie is not about the future, it is ""about now, things going on right now.""  Earth in this movie is the bad place, and the good place is a space station called 'elysium'.  I'm not sure why they called it elysium, considering how they presented it, they should have just called it Irvine.  Anyways, earth bad, elysium good, got it?

As the movie unfolds, you see how dirty and polluted earth is and how clean and safe elysium is.  Earth is patrolled by a force of police-robots.  These robots are built on earth and we soon learn that Matt Damon works at a factory where the robots are built; how uplifting...

There's a subplot involving a sick kid and rebel force whose goal is to invade elysium.  On elysium, the citizens can be treated by a medical machine that will cure any ailment you have, including disease, broken bones, etc...  I don't remember if the movie explains if these machines are in the people's homes are at the hospital, but either way, Damon gets caught up in  a plan to get to elysium, hack the sysytem so everyone can become citizens and have access to these machines and be able to save the sick girl.

So as you have figured out by know hopefully, yes, the movie is about free health care for everyone.  If you don't enjoy that part of the movie and can get over it, there's an interesting movie aside, and you see Damon take on the police-robots(with the help of a mechanic torso) and his journey to elysium while being targeted by an assassin(played by the guy who was Mudoch on the recent A-Team movie) sent by the powers of elysium.

As a sci-fi movie, it is entertaining, there's many shots of the landscape of earth, the sky is bright white and you understand the idea behind it that space travel has become so easy that elysium and likewise other plants are just a hop on a plane away; the only problem with the whole scenario being the division of humans in an ""ideal"" place and into the not so ideal place(like the Time Machine).

In the first scene, I wasn't sure whether this movie would be any ""different"" than some others in the same genre.

I was quickly proved wrong.  Neill Blomkamp's innovative ideas are rampant throughout the film.  Like District 9, he takes filmmaking to another level.  There's more action (and it's even better) than District 9, too, which is welcome.  The plot takes great twists and turns and you can tell Blomkamp is a fan of the ""build up"" and ""peaks and valleys"".  The metaphor overall is simple, but timely.  An incredibly cool and fun film to experience.

Admittedly, while the voice accents can occasionally get a bit muddled (between Spanish/French/South African), it's kind become a hallmark trait of his films now, and keeps things fresh, so I think it's cool.",1386633600,,784,4.969230769230769

The year is 2154, the earth is in ruin.  Elysian is the paradise-like space station only for the rich and privileged populace.  Those who left behind on earth must survive in a poverty state and under miserable conditions.  Damon plays Max, the one who was sent to Elysian in order to survive while reverting this extreme gap between those privileged ones and those much under-privileged majority.  Damon suffered a lot acting in this film.  While the genre of this film shares similar DNA with ""District 9"", this new film doesn't have the inventiveness and wit of the previous one.

5914792,2,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium is a deeply flawed movie. It reminds me of the Star Trek (original series) episode, ""The Cloud Minders"" in which the cloud city is beautiful, cultured and peaceful and all of that is paid for by the dirty workers on the planet below. Elysium has a substantially similar plot and some fine actors, Matt Damon and Jody Foster do their jobs well. But Elysium wasn't written by Star Trek writers.

The movie does not seem to be well-thought out. The costumes are weirdly anachronistic, Jody Foster is wearing what corporate big wigs would wear today, Matt Damon wears old torn tee-shirts. The violence is predictable and so over-the-top that it becomes boring.

There is a large mistake in the movie titles which tell us that this movie is set in the far future 2154 -- more than one hundred years from now, but at the same time, it takes place in the 21st Century -- hey dude, that's our century! 2154 is in the 22nd Century, that should be obvious to the movie makers.

The main characters don't show any development that leads them to their final denouement. Matt Damon's starts out selfish, is selfish throughout the violence and decides at the end to be a hero. Jody Foster's spends her time keeping the bad elements out of Elysium in an entirely selfish manner and doesn't change at all until suddenly at her character's end. This leads to the plot feeling disjointed. The movie goes where you expect it to go, but it doesn't really allow character development to get there. I got the feeling that Matt Damon knew he could have been a part of a better movie, but he's a professional, so he kept plugging along.

If you liked him as Jason Bourne, you will probably be disappointed in this movie.",1386028800,,1704,4.595394736842105

5914799,5,B00EHK2S04,"IMHO, An excellent film. Great to see real heroes who are genuine people. Here is my critique.

 Nice to see that the main actor  speaks languages other than American English in the film. It was also nice to see that sentiment ,humanism, and morality have reappeared in a very good epic. They even dared to show the influence of a Catholic nun on the young hero's upbringing. How many writers and movie producers have marginalized ethics and religion these days? It seems that there is a strong bias against anything smacking of spirituality and/or religion appearing in films. (With the exception of movies that are called strictly spiritual or religious or fantastic movies about the supernatural. Not that these are bad movies, the point is that we have forgotten our past and the ethical traditions that built Western Civilization.) We need to look at the history of ethics and remember that many brave men and women of the past have derived their faith and inspiration from religion/spirituality. There is  a strong secular bias in our culture against showing characters in movies who are really human and hold humanistic values. Most action heroes focus on violence, revenge, egotism, money, glory.

  This hero (flawed in the sense that he was once a thief) changed his behaviour and focused on those he loved and on humanity in general-in fact he willingly gave up his life for those he loved ( a very Christian way of looking at life and an example of practicing your beliefs to the point of death.)",1385856000,2,1508,4.844357976653696

5914801,4,B00EHK2S04,"A friend recommended this move with some reservations and I decided to purchase it and see what I thought about it myself. First of all, there isn't a Sci Fi movie that I didn't like at least a little. Also, I'll admit, that I am also a Matt Damon and Jodie Foster Fan. So, how did Matt do? His character, Max, is all grown up into a street thug on parole in a run down city of the future.  He clearly knows how to act the part and plays the role really well - that's the thing about Matt Damon, he never lets you know he's just acting. Then there is Jodie Foster. Clearly she is playing a sophisticated security chief and does it well with an accent and an element of sophistication and deviousness, which is a polar opposite of Matt Damon's role, at least from the space station perspective. The plot was just a tad bit thin, but it's enough to keep my attention throughout the movie. Its not one of those plots that jumps out at the last minute, or keeps you wondering what it is. Its like a rail road train, you know where you are going the minute the train left the station. But, if its a trip from one end of the country to another, what route you take is another story. And that is what Elysium is all about. There are really great special affects. Just how do you get an atmosphere that you can breathe in space without an airlock and have it seem possible to us Sci Fi movie buffs? Watch and see. And what will the rich do with all that money someday? Well, it just figures! This movie has heroes, and sacrifice. It also has crazy people working for the bad guys, and only slightly crazy people who are fighting for a better way of life for everyone else. Its a possible outcome of our own world, the separation of classes, if we keep going down the path we are going, or at least one possible outcome if we do. The movie made me think, and I like movies that make me think. Besides a thin plot, and supporting actors that are just a bit more than mediocre,  the 'aha' moment allows you to forgive the shortcomings of this movie and wonder what you would do. After all, its a wonderful life, or at least it could be. If you are a thinker, this movie is perfect for Christmas time!",1385856000,2,2189,4.197149643705464

5914805,3,B00EHK2S04,"Director Neill Blomkamp made gained international fame with the underground hit District 9, which combined special effects and strong acting with a nuanced social commentary about interracial relations in Blomkamp's native South Africa. Elysium continues many of the same themes but also suggests that Blomkamp might be adopting the worst tendencies of Hollywood.

As a standalone science fiction movie, Elysium is pretty decent. It's a fast sci-fi thriller about a man (Matt Damon) who seeks a better life on an orbiting station called Elysium. Earth has fallen into dire straights while the wealthy seek refuge in Elysium. There are some pretty bold plot twists and the movie manages to be an entertaining ride. However, the movie promised to be more than just another sci-fi action movie. Unfortunately, it proves to be less compelling as social commentary.

The movie nearly hits you over the head with the immigration theme. This movie is about immigration and Neill Blomkamp wants you to know it. Blomkamp even went so far as to cast Hispanics for most of the characters stuck on Earth (with the notable exception of Matt Damon). The residents of Elysium are all white and have American accents. As an analogy for U.S. immigration politics, this is about as subtle as a Rush Limbaugh.

However, effective social commentary needs more than just an analogy. The story should help viewers understand the issue better or from a new perspective. Again, the lack of subtlety undermines the commentary. The managers of Elysium are portrayed as villains of the worst sort. Jodie Foster is an unsympathetic dictator and Sharlto Copley is a sadistic bounty hunter who likes killing immigrants. The residents of Elysium are portrayed merely as wealthy and out-of-touch. The immigrants we see simply want access to better medical care for them or their adorable children. As such, the movie seems to insist that keeping illegal immigrants out is morally inexcusable.

Yet, for all of its analogies to real-world immigration politics, the movie's depiction of immigration says nothing about real-world immigration politics. The movie never explores the real driver behind immigration politics, namely competition between low-wage American workers and immigrant workers. If anything, the wealthy in America and corporations are more likely to favor immigration as a source of cheap labor. There are also important questions about the capacity of government institutions and resources to handle a large influx of immigrants.

Elysium chooses simplistic answers rather than exploring these tensions. The movie's finale borders on ridiculous. *SPOILER* The Earth residents manage to make all humans citizens of Elysium and thereby grant them all access to Elysium's healthcare system. However, in practice this would probably quickly overburden the health system, leading to a deterioration in quality or a complete collapse. *SPOILER*

The contrast to District 9 is illuminating. In that movie, there were no black and white heroes and villains. The government's policies were portrayed as wrong, but not evil. Sharlto Copley's character in District 9, Wikus, the government inspector, started off as a hapless bureaucrat, not a sadistic monster (a sharp contrast to Copley's character in Elysium). More importantly, District 9 shows Wikus gradually learning about the aliens and gaining respect for them. The movie invited viewers to take the same journey as Wikus and showed us why the government policies were wrong. By contrast, I felt that too often Elysium simply tried to force its arguments on viewers.

I've probably been too harsh on Elysium but only because Neill Blomkamp raised the bar so high. Again, as an action/adventure sci-fi movie it holds up pretty well. I focused on the social commentary aspects of the film because it permeates so much of Elysium. My review is not intended to argue a particular side of the immigration debate, but rather to show just how unsatisfactory Elysium is as social commentary. One gets the sense that Blomkamp dumbed down the social commentary and adopted more traditional Hollywood approaches to moviemaking, including increasing the action, hiring famous actors, and dumbing down the social commentary. It's worth watching, but with lowered expectations.

Overall: 3.5 stars.",1385769600,5,4318,5.3584070796460175
5914806,3,B00EHK2S04,"Anticipating a decent sci-fi, I was disappointed overall:

The good:  CGI (not exceptional).

The bad: shallow predictable plot (not very well connected), lots of unnecessary swearing, very District 9-like but not as good, no chemistry between Matt D and his ""girl"" or even Jodie F and others (I really expected a good film with favourites JF and MD both in it), predictable scenes, pretty limited vocal part for an actress of JF's talents, pretty average acting all round actually. Throw in the usual South African mercenaries with one brain cell to shore up the ""action""... Oh, the robots are also quite antiquated in structure, acting, and vocals.

If you want to see both MD and JF in decent films, I enjoyed his Spielberg film about the tsunami and other related human stories (highly emotive and great, passionate acting). The same goes for JF's Flight Plan : excellent. But in this film, neither are going to win Oscars for either acting or roles and the whole sci-fi film is a very average watch with telly-tubbyish ending. The old Star Trek films had much better stories and more bite (and real acting). Even Oblivion was better, albeit with Tom Cruise in it...a poorer actor to either of the stars here by a fair way but he seemed to have done a slightly better job.

With all the resources at hand for film producers, I wonder why there are no worthy sci-fi for years. The Fifth Element by talented Luc Besson is so much better than Elysium in every way...and of similar story ilk but more expansive and far more interesting (and funny).",1385769600,2,1548,4.718518518518518
5914807,3,B00EHK2S04,"ELYSIUM takes place in the year 2154, on an Earth that has all but died out due to war, disease, overpopulation, etc. - when the film opens, the entire planet looks like Beirut on a really, really bad day. By now there are only two classes of people on the planet: the super-rich, who long ago were ferried off Earth to the space station Elysium, where they can breathe clean air and continue to live in luxury ... and everyone else, still stuck back on Earth.

Matt Damon plays Max, an ex-con just trying to go straight, who works a factory job helping to build the nuclear-powered robots that serve as the police force now. It's a tough as hell life on Earth, where you are guilty until proven innocent (especially if you have a record) and any attempts to fly an unauthorized ship to Elysium to escape this life might get you shot out of the sky - but after a horrible accident exposes Max to radiation poisoning, giving him only days to live, he throws convention and the law away, getting in touch with his old criminal cronies to find any way he can to Elysium - where medical pods exist, in abundance, that can cure any and all illness in the human body (again, a privilege ONLY now for the rich, in 2154).

But on Elysium, the minister of defense, Delacourt (a blonde Jodie Foster, complete with an unidentifiable accent that is so ridiculous, it's distracting) has her own plans. Secretly planning to get the president of Elysium out of office so she can take over in a well-planned coup, those plans are thwarted when some badly-needed information she needs instead ends up with Max ... who, in turn, ends up with Delacourt's whacked-out, insane hired assassin Kruger (Sharlto Copley, as vicious as it gets here) after him.

'Elysium' is a good film, I really liked it, but it does suffer a bit from predictability. You'll recognize bits here and there from other science fiction and action films, and again every time Jodie Foster speaks with that obviously-fake accent I just wanted to yell, ""STOP THAT!"". But even with standard plot devices and a couple of cartoonish characters, maybe because of Damon the film is still enjoyable to watch, and has some nice suspense that will have you rooting for Max and those he cares about. If you like Damon you should see this, and I even kind of like Jodie as a platinum blonde ... icy as it makes her look.",1385769600,2,2361,4.550588235294118

5914814,3,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium's premise is that the poor and destitute live on Earth in slums, enslaved in terrible jobs while the rich live on a Halo-like planet where they never get sick or old but spend their days looking down on Earth like a universal trashcan while counting their money. Unfortunately, there's only one security guard on the whole of Elysium and Earth immigrants keep trying to fly in illegally, knowing there's no ICE enforcement. Jodie Foster dons a Christine Lagarde outfit and Bond villain accent to defend their Utopia in the sky by getting her spies to shoot down these ships - from Earth - using shoulder-mounted rocket launchers.

After some intro title cards explaining all this (a bad start) and some twaddle about young Matt's child sweetheart (oh dear), the plot eventually kicks off when Matt Damon gets himself radiated in an industrial accident that had no reason to include radiation. Severely weakened with 5 days to live, for little reason they strap a half-ton exoskeleton to his bones that somehow makes him stronger. William Fichtner is the evil boss who put profit above safety in Matt's factory but conveniently enough also programmed all of Elysium's computers and can hack them so he's ripe for both some kind of comeuppance and fixing this social inequality issue using a hack.

Meanwhile, Jodie Foster has a particularly evil henchmen who fires exploding self-guiding ninja stars that can hit anybody but Matt Damon. His accent is so strong, nobody within 1000 miles of the US is going to have a clue what he's talking about but that's ok since most of the time it's about how much he wants to find Matt. There is literally no other type of security on Elysium - not even one mall cop so this all becomes a showdown between Damon and the Heavily Accented Bad Guy. Fichtner meanwhile has the hack that's now in Damon's head and if only Matt can get to some computer on Elysium in time and hope the USB cable fits, everything will be ok.

District 9 was great, Elysium not so much. Apart from the simplistic political messages scattered with a heavy hand, it suffers from occasionally risible dialog, 5th grade plot logic and a severe lack of characterization or plotting. There's just a lack of any complexity to keep the pace moving after about an hour and while the CG effects are very impressive they can't stop this short film starting to drag by the final act. It's a shame since I the sci-fi arena has been bare recently but I even though Elysium is mildly enjoyable if you switch your brain off, you're not likely to view a second time.",1385683200,2,2569,4.704444444444444

The earth sets look like something from an 80's break dance movie.

The Sci-Fi part is barely explored. It's not like Gattaca in any way. Gattaca is ten times more complex and interesting.

The director just wants to say rich people are bad. That's pretty much the sum total of his artistic vision. His depiction of the affluent people who reside on Elysium is so caricaturish that it's laughable. It's as if he looked at some photos of a party in the Hamptons he saw on Guest of a Guest and used those as his inspiration.

Class war is a complex matter, but here it is addressed in the least complex of ways. Marx's Manifesto is far, far more complex. Go watch The Matrix and some Mike Leigh movies instead of this rubbish.

I like Matt Damon, but he should stick to playing characters with a Harvard IQ. They don't have to be rich people. Will Hunting was not. The guy in The Departed was not. Just let his characters be smart. He looks trapped playing characters below his level of intelligence. Same goes for Jake Gyllenhaal and Edward Norton.",1385596800,5,1319,4.668103448275862

There is no entry to this eco-system for the rest of the people on Earth who are considered to be poor. It is controlled by a President, Patel and a power hungry Defense Secretary, Jessica. This eco-system has a clean environment devoid of any diseases and the capability to cure any kind of human disorder within seconds in a specialized medical bed call Med Bay accessible only for the citizens of Elysium - the main reason why all the people on the devastated earth want an access to Elysium. Jessica prevents illegal entries into Elysium through her dangerous ally on Earth, Kruger.
Max de Costa, who works in a company called Armadyne, headed and owned by John Carlyle, which supplies arms and critical software to Elysium, once, accidentally gets exposed to radiation and is sacked, for he shall die in 5 days. Max wants to go to Elysium and get treated since he wants to live with his childhood girl friend Frey, but will be denied access. He approaches his old friend and arms smuggler Spider, who agrees to send Max to Elysium, provided, he gets the valuable software that controls the entire Elysium and Armadyne embedded in a chip stored in the brain of John Carlyle. Max agrees for the trade off, without knowing the underlying danger.
At the same time, Jessica enters into a secret business deal with John, to create a software that could make her, the President of Elysium. John creates the same and stores it in his chip with an encryption that can be copied only to a similar chip but kills the person to whom it is downloaded in, for a reboot. Spider installs a similar chip into Maxs brain and downloads the software into Maxs, while John dies in the process. Knowing this, Jessica entrusts Kruger, to bring Max to Elysium and take control of the software, that could officially make her the President. Kruger, along with Max, Frey and her leukemia affected daughter, land in Elysium. Kruger suddenly turns against Jessica and kills her for an old time revenge and in the process tries to take control of Elysium, having coming to know of the deadly secret in Maxs brain.
Ultimately, Max overpowers Kruger physically, and allows Spider to reboot the entire software of Elysium, that grants its citizenship and access to Med Bay, to the entire population on Earth, sacrificing himself to the good cause. The movie comes to an emotional end when Max dies after the re-boot but saves the entire world.

A movie that creates a kind of fear and doubts who watches it, as to what the future has in store for them, if they do not have enough money to get access to the technology that can give them a decent living. Who said money cannot buy anything? At least, it might be required to keep our children alive.

5914826,3,B00EHK2S04,"I don't mind brainless sci-fi. Sometimes it's nice just to have something cool to look at for awhile. Also, I have no problem with movies that moralize. It's great to question things, propose new ideas, or just point at injustices in the hopes of raising awareness. I DO, however, have a problem when a movie ends up being both, especially since a lot of the time it ends up accidentally trivializing something I usually already care about. Case in point: Elysium.

The story concerns Max, a reformed criminal who lives in a futuristic, devastated Los Angeles. The world, ravaged by pollution and overpopulation, is now filled with nothing but the poor and lower classes. If you're lucky, like Max, you have a job. In his case, he works for Armadyne, the company that produces the robots that police and monitor the world. All of the wealthiest people in the world, meanwhile, have created Elysium, a utopian space colony in orbit high above Earth, where they live in unbelievably crystalline splendor. They also have these magical beds that can instantly cure any disease or ailment in a matter of seconds. The poor folk on Earth, of course, must deal with second-rate health care that, while seemingly public, is dismissive and half-hearted. When an accident at work gives Max less than a week to live, he dons a superstrong exo-skeleton and undertakes a mission to make it to Elysium to get to one of those magic, medical beds. During the course of his mission, he finds his own selfish views challenged by corrupt senators, mind-bogglingly cute kids with leukemia, and a helter-skelter style military strong-arm named Kruger.

Visually appealing with some stunning action sequences, the movie is a popcorn muncher from nearly the first frame (although I'm leaving out the first five minutes of clunky Hallmark-style exposition and character development, much of which involves a nun). Directed by the same guy who gave us the rousing and engaging District 9, the pacing, framing, and cinematography is pretty much top-of-the-line.

The problem is that the script is about as heavy-handed as that big stone guy from The NeverEnding Story. The symbolism has got all of the subtlety of a sledgehammer, and when you step back and really think about the story, there's a whole lot that doesn't make sense. For instance, it's never clear why these medical beds are hoarded on Elysium. Do they use an excessive amount of power or resources? Is it considered economically or socially better to have the bulk of your citizenry in a state of malnourishment and filth? Do they break down easily? It automatically classifies the Haves of the movie as heartless and selfish for no real, good reason. Furthermore, the Haves are totemized in the cold, unforgiving character of Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster doing ... well, whatever kind of accent she was aiming for, the result was awful and distracting). Ms. Delacourt's machinations tend to be completely nonsensical as well. I won't give too much away, other than to say that some of her behavior hinges on the fact that Presidents, in this future, can be displaced by rebooting computer programs. It'd be like waking up one day and discovering that Sarah Palin is the President instead of Obama. ""But how? Why?"" we'd ask. ""This computer says she is,"" they say. ""Oh. Okay, then.""

Huh?

Obviously a morality play about apartheid, social divisions, the economic gap, and human rights, the movie takes a message that I tend to agree with and makes it so cartoonish and implausible that it almost seems to be making fun of it. The action, the 'splosions, the cool fight scenes, and the various swooping, wooshing, clanking destruction of it all makes for some fun, mindless viewing, but when the movie tries to prove that it does have some kind of brainwave, it gets both in-your-face and nearly incomprehensible. In other words, the seriousness of the film has as much brassy, crazy fire as the shallower elements, making it all seem rather patronizing.

Try not to think too hard about it, and you might enjoy yourself, but be warned. When it's not dazzling you with its pyrotechnic skill, the movie WILL try to get you to think. That's probably the point when you should get up for more popcorn.",1384646400,265,4260,4.909722222222222

5914831,4,B00EHK2S04,"Neil Blomkamp's second feature film, Elysium, is not as good as District 9, his prodigious 2009 feature film debut. That first Blomkamp movie was a miracle film - brilliant in its vision and as emotionally powerful and gripping as the greatest Dystopian science fiction film of all time - Bladerunner.

Even if Elysium does not measure up well with the high standards of its classic predecessor,this is hardly a reason not to see Blomkamp's unique vision of the future take on a wider scale. We continue to witness a young director map out his unique vision on a much larger canvas. His talent for creating new worlds and invoking a mood to match the scale, is all well worth seeing again.

Elysium is a fable of a world gone horribly wrong. Social ills have reached a terrifying level of mismanagement and neglect in the year 2154. The divide between the rich and poor has become massive and unbridgeable. The vast differences have set the privileged few to abandon their planet and flee from the languishing poor to create a wealthy, secluded, spotless off-world space colony in orbit far above and away from the social chaos of the withering world they have left behind.

The off-world enclave for the rich, aptly named ""Elysium"", is built to be a paradise of tranquility and its spotless world is much like the afterlife wished for and imagined by the ancient Greeks. This is a world replete with comfort and security with technological toys catered to keep the physical and mental well-being of Elysium's creators - the elite rich - in perfect condition, free of pain, death and disease. Every home has a miracle machine programmed to heal the human body at any stage of deterioration. There is a settled peace on Elysium with crime non-existent, the life of leisure constant, and the inhabitants humming in perfect health.

But the surface ease and tranquility of its inhabitants barely hides the systematic hatred and exclusion they have encouraged. The contrast of this world of brightness, clean air, perfect health, and safety with a world plunged in disease and turmoil on earth below is a telling one. This setting of contrasts, so much a part of the aesthetic of District 9 reaches a bigger scale here in Elysium and magnifies the sense of rebellion in the dying world below.

Matt Damon plays Max, one of the abandoned poor who longs to escape his plight on earth. Max, like many others, pines for Elysium; as a child, he has looked up longingly to this world of dreams. He has learned to talk of it as if it was the afterlife, after a trying existence on earth. But the defense of this glistening abode of the rich is callously overseen by Delacourt, well played by Jodie Foster in an uncharacteristically villainous turn as the secretary of defense at Elysium. Max works as an assembly line worker in a factory that manufactures and sends out robots as a first line of defense against the likes of him. After Max is forced to confront his own mortality his sole aim becomes to plan a rebel invasion to tap into the vast medical resources of Elysium. The cure for his rapidly failing health becomes his driving ambition. But Delacourt tries to put a stop to this. She does this with brutal and unthinking efficiency. Sharlto Copley, Director Neil Blomkamp's lead star in District 9, as Kruger, in another great performance, is the one man demolition squad for Delacourt. As her foot-soldier who will stop at nothing to carry out her orders, Kruger does his bit to resist the efforts of Max and his team of rebels.

Elysium proves that Matt Damon's success as an action star, since the Bourne series, is no fluke. He continues to show that he can do the action star bit convincingly. Damon is getting better at his craft and he has that unique quality to convincingly take on the role of an ordinary guy who takes on an extraordinary role when he is forced to lead.

Blomkamp revives themes from District 9 - the rich against the poor, the marginalized world of slums set against the world of the privileged, that drives the apocalyptic theme envisioned here. The drama of the desperation of the poor foregrounded here is a reminder of the world imagined in District 9. This story sets up a similar need of a Herculean Christ-like figure, reviled and marginalized through most of the narrative. This is precisely a world that demands heroes and the story and characters are set up to answer this need.

But the emotional weight disappears gradually and the story of love and sacrifice lapses into melodrama. The directorial choices made here do not map out well and characters brimming with potential are drowned by the scale of the spectacle (the special effects are as awe inspiring as any sci-fi film this year). The human dimension of the story rapidly evaporates and the script veers gradually into cliche. The tragic sense that lay at the heart of the art of Blomkamp's District 9 is diluted as the plot gains momentum. As we reach the denouement, the director seems to let the tragic tension that he so artfully engaged with in his first film languish in some crucial moments.

As a science fiction, action film, Elysium is great entertainment but only if you come in determined to forget that this is directed by that prodigy who created District 9. But if you see Elysium for what it is - an action film and a great Friday night at the movies - with reliable performances from Damon, Copley, and an inspired supporting cast, and as a wonderful journey to another meticulously crafted world by Blomkamp, this is a spectacle you will not want to miss. This is another science fiction film worth embracing despite its flaws. As such it belongs to that category of films with set-pieces and production values that are nothing short of astonishing  - like Oblivion and Prometheus - but with stories that lose steam precisely at those  moments we expected so much more from its distinguished directors.",1383955200,15,5919,4.748054474708171
5914832,1,B00EHK2S04,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Like the extremely overrated District 9, Elysium's lone strength is its convincing special effects and its weaknesses are in every other area. Although there is nothing as terribly stupid as the District 9 ""alien blood that can bond with human DNA ... and also power spaceships,"" Elysium is heavy handed allegory, amped up drama and dramatically ridiculous.

Some of the ships and robots are great to look at---seeing Syd Mead's name in the credits was not a big surprise.

Since the days of Hitchcock people seemed to have forgotten that the first and most important job of a director is not to come up with 'cool visuals,' but direct actors. Ergo, the title, 'director.'

So congrats to Blomkamp for showing me the first truly terrible Jodie Foster performance. It's like he showed her a 1960s spider-man cartoon and said, 'like this but bigger.' And a lot of her work was dubbed for some reason, likely accent inconsistency (even though it's still inconsistent in the end product). And i am a HUGE William Fichtner fan, but this movie also showcases his career nadir. Sometimes he seems to be imitating Data from Star Trek, other times, sort of German. And Copley as the villain...well if there is a less menacing accent than this, i haven't heard it. And he is of course, way, way over the top as he was in District 9 (though he was decent in Europa Report). Damon is the only performer whose work is credible, probably because he's a big enough star to just say no if Blomkamp wants to turn him into a screaming cartoon.

In terms of story, don't expect any science or anything other than good versus evil. Sadly, with rare exception, Hollywood science fiction movies are really just noisy action movies these days, and as a huge science fiction fan I know i'll rarely see any interesting scientific elements in these (though the movies of Duncan Jones and Kosinski do have some smart ideas and are the exceptions). So no, Elysium isn't sci-fi, but just heavy handed action movie allegory, more or less the same class warfare of District 9, so he's already retreading this theme. Then there is the would-be action centerpiece exo-skeletal suit, an idea that doesn't work at all, and isn't well sold visually. Really, as designed, this thing wouldn't work without tearing off fingers and smashing the limbs of its user, which is why most exo-skeletal designs are also armor that could shield a water-based lifeform. In any case, the actions scenes are so shaky and over cut, it's hard to see what's happening regardless. But I never had even a moment of thinking the thing actually functioned or would function.

Blomkamp clearly has a political viewpoint---one that I have no issue with at all, except that it makes his writing too pedantic and monochromatic. A strong viewpoint does not make one a good writer. Writing rich people are bad and poor people are good is not dramatically compelling to watch, even if you actually believe things are that simple. Look at the success George RR Martin is having with complex characters...Blomkamp's writing seems like that of a child by comparison. That Elysium is self-important and humorless, doesn't help.

And if Blomkamp (who clearly should not write his own movies) really understood science fiction the way actual science fiction writers do---guys like Greg Egan, JMS, Ted Chiang, Arthur C. Clarke, Greg Bear, M. John Harrison, Stephen Baxter, Larry Niven, etc.--- he would not have a future world technology where humans can be rebuilt at an atomic level in the same world as one in which robots fire guns and miss their targets. (!!!) Robots hitting their targets when they fire is near future and to some extent, current; rebuilding bodies at an atomic level (in less than a minute) is very, very, very far future, if ever.

But like most Hollywood junk---and the similarly stupid, crazily overrated breakthrough success District 9--- Blomkamp is doing something that looks like science fiction, but isn't.",1382745600,20,4007,4.891016200294551
5914833,4,B00EHK2S04,"What if Wall-E were real?  That's the question director Matt Damon and director Neill Blomkamp try to answer in Elysium.  Actually, there have been plenty of films depicting world-ending scenarios this summer, nonetheless, this is the one that stars Matt Damon, so pay attention.

The word ""Elysium"" actually refers to a Greek notion of the afterlife where those chosen by the gods would spend eternity.  Blomkamp's Elysium reveals a similar idea with the ironic twist being that the ""chosen few"" are simply the world's wealthiest and most privileged.  Here Elysium is a space station constructed miles above Earth's atmosphere designed to house the planet's most fortunate, so that they can maintain their lavish lifestyle without the burdens of living on an overpopulated Earth.  The year is 2154.  Max (Damon) is an average guy living in L.A. who finds himself in a life or death situation that can only be cured by the advanced medical treatments available on Elysium.  Elysium's strict immigration laws prevent unauthorized travel to the haven, leaving Max to desperate measures.

Blomkamp's film is wonderfully directed.  With brilliant juxtapositions between Elysium and Earth, he designs a very well made story that looks all too real!  Scenes of sweeping, Eden-esque beauty are shattered by guerrilla-style wildness of a civilization clinging to existence.  Slightly reminiscent of Minority Report, Max's humanity and loss thereof is accentuated with symbolic intensity and careful pacing.  His decent into despair is marked by a crude cyborg-like surgical implant that Blomkamp uses to remind us of how close we are from becoming a race of data transfer capsules.  The film's various villains are united and yet compartmentalized representing a visionary balance of complexity that while slightly excessive could have been tremendously overbearing.  Blomkamp's previous film District 9 was in a similar topical vein, and while it was a better film overall than Elysium, this latest film is a finer directorial effort, perhaps worthy of Oscar's attention, although unlikely given the film's weaknesses in other areas.

Elysium's main problem is in the writing.  The problem is that Elysium should be more upsetting than it is.  It attempts to invoke the spirit, the outrage, and the temperament of the Occupy Wall-Street movement, showing a wealthy 1% looking down on a struggling and desperate 99%.  However, this is done in a rather heavy-handed way that comes across simplistic and, at times, stereotypically vapid.  This is most apparent in examining Jodi Foster's Secretary Delacourt who attempts to plan a coup for seemingly no better reason than because her fascist ways are more fascist than the current fascist in charge.  Foster does her best with what she's given, but a complicated issue is reduced to a shred of viability, turning what could have been a deeply stirring sci-fi commentary into just another by the numbers hero tale.  Questions are left unanswered especially in the film's closing act, which offers a naive and, while plausible, uneven resolution.  Not to mention that the film fails to soften the reality that Damon, Blomkamp, and company are pandering to a low to middle class audience about the gap between the haves and the have-nots.  I had a similar issue with Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby from earlier this Spring.  This is the ""Catch-22 of A-List Hollywood in the economically polarized 21st century.

Pompousness aside, Elysium offers a fast-paced, stirring, visually well-made exploration of a slice of humanity.  While it may not accomplish what it set out to do contextually, it is still a worthy film deserving of some credence.  B

Elysium is rated R and has a refreshingly appropriate running time of 1 hour and 37 minutes.  While not the near masterpiece of sci-fi that was District 9, Elysium is a good summer movie and a great example of visionary directing.",1382572800,4,3916,5.2092651757188495

I forgot I even saw this movie until I was cleaning up my desk and found the ticket stub for this movie. The only reason I watched it was to kill time so I wouldn't have been stuck in that God awful tunnel traffic after work.

The visuals, what few there were, are great but the story is old, tired,  worn out, and predictable. This movie was OK but not worth the $7.00 I paid to watch it. With that said, I won't be adding this to my collection even if it's given to me.",1382486400,3,791,4.26

5914838,5,B00EHK2S04,"I think it's a really great movie, or more specifically a great piece of dramatic provocative cinema.

2 hidden messages i saw.  Or at least as movies go, this sort of thing really emanates that hidden-message vibe, and in a movie like this, one would expect a vast number of hidden messages.

1. On the bottom of Kruger's aircraft (which is shaped like the freemason eagle on the back of the dollar bill, a digital camo version rather :) is a number scaling the bottom: 030211.  There could've been written anything on the bottom of the plane, and certainly not in numbers in massive size.  In the movie it's obviously the number of the aircraft, but I was thinking it seemed a little specific.  ??? People please help be investigate this number :-) the burden can't be entirely upon me to figure it out, so please assist me.  What happened on march 2, 2011 that neil wanted us to look at?  I think it was a few days before fukushima, which was on the 11th i think.

The other hidden message that stood out was the gun that matt damon used called the ""chem rail"".  Again, super oversized letters written on a weapon, and weapons Never have huge names written on them.  Certainly at that point in the movie, the title of the gun did nothing to support anything else that was going on dramatically, well it did just enough to make you think it fit in, but still felt contrived.  So in a movie Like This, out of any movie, wouldn't the director who is clearly hip to darker forces in the world, controversial subjects and conspiracies... well, what do you folks hip to conspiracies think of when you see the big letters ""Chem Rail""?  I think the movie would've be overwhelmed with subplots if neil had put in chem trails to the story, but i think he wanted us to notice them as a very important issue, because all the other hidden messages of the movie are woven in deeply, not all surface-level and contrived like the cheesy gun called the chem rail.

UPDATE:
Ok, the story of the movie, which i wasn't entirely certain of, makes sense to me now.  There are only a few hollywoody moments that were unrealistic, and seemed done just for the sake of haste, moving the story along.  And on that note, this was a much more thorough story before Blomkamp finished the film.  This movie more than any movie I've ever seen is completely streamlined, they did a second draft on the script where they just hacked up the first one to create a very fast moving story.  They sped it up so much that it takes like 2-3 close watches to pick up everything, well, at least for me :-P.  I absolutely love the film and it is a hard-charged masterpiece, a very good dramatic action future movie.",1381708800,4,2675,4.444672131147541
5914839,4,B00EHK2S04,"I fell in love with Neill Blomkamp's first film ""District 9""; the South African filmmaker's take on a sci-fi film was really brilliant and shows how a filmmaker with a unique storytelling voice can create something new and exciting. It was an eye-opening experience and even more remarkable because it was the filmmaker's first full-length feature.

His second film ""Elysium"" is not quite as ground-breaking or original, but it does add a unique voice, making it a more interesting sci-fi film. In a less talented director's hands, ""Elysium"" would be a routine sci-fi programmer, the type of film quickly forgotten and relegated to endless cable runs. But Blomkamp's vision and style help ensure that ""Elysium"" will be remembered as a highlight of the summer.

Los Angeles in 2154 is an overpopulated, toxicly polluted, dry and brown landscape in which people toil at meaningless jobs and struggle to survive. Yes, I said 2154 and not 2013. The working class is essentially stuck on Earth in what is a police state. The rich and wealthy live on a space station that looks like Beverly Hills and comes complete with machines able to heal any sickness or ailment. The people on Earth make attempts to board Elysium, to take advantage of the healing machines, but Delacourt (Jodie Foster), the head of Defense, quickly orders these errant spaceships shot down. Back on Earth, Max (Matt Damon) gets involved in an accident at work and becomes irradiated. He soon learns he has five days to live. Struggling to figure out how to survive, he meets mercenaries who offer to help him; they will strap a metal framework to his body and use intelligence stolen from Carlyle (William Fichtner) to get past Elysium's security network. As Max struggles with these preparations (the framework is physically attached to his body), he reconnects with Frey (Alice Braga), a girl he grew up with in an orphanage. She now has a daughter who is sick and about to die, giving Max even more reason to get to Elysium. But Delacourt also has a rogue warrior, Kruger (Sharlito Copley), in her pocket and enlists him to stop Max and help her restore order.

Written and directed by Blomkamp, the narrative of ""Elysium"" is presented in an economical way, which keeps the story moving and holds your interest. There is a very brief intro before we watch an unauthorized shuttle approach the space station. We watch Delacourt go into action and then focus on Max back on Earth. Max labors through every day, much like the other people living in Los Angeles, but he does what he has to do and tries to remain positive about everything. We quickly learn about his living situation, his job, what life is like in this Los Angeles. It isn't great. A lot of sci-fi films run over two hours and this is usually attributed to the set-up and backstory necessary to get us involved in the story. Blomkamp doesn't stop the narrative to give us details, he gives us the details as part of the narrative. It is so much more engaging to learn these things as the story unfolds - because so much is happening, we pay closer attention and enjoy the finer points of this filmmaker's work.

Max lives in a little shack in the middle of an even more run-down part of town. This is the part of town run by Spider (Wagner Moura), the man behind constant attempts to get sick people up to Elysium for treatment. He finally comes up with a plan and Max is the key. But Max is a reluctant hero and takes some convincing. When he decides to help Spider out, the process proves to be painful, continuously forcing Max to prove his determination to help. Watching Max's journey also propels us further into his universe and life.

There are a lot of things going on in ""Elysium"". Spider wants to get sick people to the space station, to receive treatment. This is a driving force in his life. But he also wants to get people up there - any people - to help break the exclusivity of this place, to smash the class barrier. He uses one obsession as a mask for another.

Matt Damon's Max is an interesting reluctant hero. Max seems happy to be just surviving. In fact, after he has an accident and work and receives a dire prognosis, his desire to continue living drives him to take the next steps to help Spider and become part of his team. Throughout the journey we share with Max, we learn about him and his view of life, we see a few moments he shared with Frey when they were kids, moments that foreshadow who they will both become. It is a surprisingly complex character and Damon brings a lot to the role.

Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, the head of security for Elysium. She is a steely woman who doesn't seem to think twice about ordering a shuttle of Earth refugees shot down before it reaches Elysium. Her focus is to keep the people of Elysium safe and her focus never wavers. Even when the President questions her and threatens to reprimand her, she seems to consider these to be minor inconveniences and continues forward with her duties, never missing a step. In fact, the threat of a reprimand only serves to make her take the next step in her plan.

Sharlito Copley plays Kruger, a mercenary under the thumb of Delacourt, willing and able to do whatever it takes to fulfill his responsibilities. Copley, the star of ""District 9"", adds a unique character to the film. As soon as Kruger sees the power shifting, he takes advantage of the situation to the best of his ability. And this allows Copley to really allow Kruger to become larger than life. He is almost a human version of the Terminator, pursuing his goals with an unhuman tenacity.

The fact that the name of the space station Elysium - where all of the rich and privileged live, and where they have no worries, no sickness - is borrowed from Greek mythology adds another level of interest to the film and shows the creativity of Blomkamp. It goes back to that 'unique storyteller' thing I was talking about earlier. Let's face it, many won't get the reference - many writers and directors probably wouldn't - so when a filmmaker does, you sit up and take notice. Everyone wanted to go to the Elysium Fields, paradise, like heaven, to be with family and friends, to never get sick again. The Elysium in this film is remarkably similar to Beverly Hills - large estates, predominately white marble, lots of green spaces. The only difference is the slight curve to the landscape to reflect the curve in the space station.

Once Max and Kruger arrive at Elysium, the film falters a bit and becomes more conventional. They battle each other, fighting to the death. It is a well-orchestrated fight, but it doesn't offer a lot of new visual material for us to savor, material that Blomkamp has already earned a reputation for.

The entire final act falters slightly, veering very close to a routine sci-fi conclusion. This is disappointing because everything up to that point is really good, memorable and interesting.

Blomkamp is a skilled craftsman, capable of creating a unique moviegoing experience. I hope he continues to use his skill, his voice, to create many, many more films to come.",1381104000,8,7104,4.665335463258786

Matt Damon stars as Max, who lives in a completely Mexicanized Los Angeles, and is on his death throes after being exposed to radiation in a factory accident. He wants to infiltrate Elysium in order to cure himself (the residents of Elyisum has cutting edge medical technology able t o cure all ailments which is denied to the inhabitants of the Earth) and to do that he decides to work for a bunch of gangsters. Though the political undertones and the metaphors of the movies are a bit obvious, the film is entertaining and well done.

5914843,4,B00EHK2S04,"In the year 2154, the earth is ravaged and overpopulated. Only the wealthiest can live in the ring-shaped space station called Elysium. The basic concept of this utopian/dystopian futuristic world is nothing original, but what makes ""Elysium,"" writer/director Neill Blomkamp's much anticipated follow-up to ""District 9,"" is its stunning visuals including the unique designs of the space station.

A reformed car thief Max (Matt Damon) living in ruined LA gets severely injured while working at a factory, and he has only five days to live. To get the medical care he needs, Max attempts to infiltrate Elysium, a heavily fortified gated community in charge of ruthless Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster). But things get more complicated as they go, of course.

Alice Braga (""City of God"") plays Max's childhood friend Frey. Sharlto Copley, star of ""District 9,"" is a mercenary hired by Delacourt. Wagner Moura (""Elite Squad"") is a smuggler ""Spider."" Diego Luna is Max's friend Julio assisting him.

The film's premise has strong political undertones, which, as the story goes on, are often overshadowed by a series of fierce combat action, but those overtones remain in the conclusion that you will either like or hate.

5914845,2,B00EHK2S04,"In 2009, out of the scrapped Halo movie, first-time director Neill Blomkamp shocked the world with District 9, a very unique film about extraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa. It currently holds a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, citing its unique story (a rarity in films these days), excellent acting, writing, and (despite its modest budget) special effects. Naturally, expectations were high for his follow up, Elysium. After viewing Blomkamp's second film, one wonders whether he was pressed for time, because it plays out like a first draft in need of heavy revision.

In the year 2154, the ultra wealthy live on Elysium, a utopian space station where crime, sickness, and war are nonexistent. Everyone else is stuck on an overpopulated, impoverished earth. One man, however, has the means to change all of that and bring equality to the two worlds.

There isn't a singular flaw that can be attributed to Elysium's catastrophic failure, but ""absolutely no character development"" is towards the top of the list. Our protagonist, Max (played by Matt Damon) is an ex-con who's trying to stay on the ""straight and narrow"". It's difficult to care about him because he is essentially a cardboard cutout, like every character in this movie. The squalor the earthlings live in is portrayed with excellent, stark imagery, but viewers need more than imagery to stay invested in the ""good"" characters and their plight. ""Why should we root for Max? What makes him so special?"" It's unfortunate that Blomkamp doesn't answer these questions.

Some of the characters are an extreme hindrance to the success of the film. Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, Elysium's cruel, scheming Secretary of Defense who has a penchant for poor acting including, but not limited to, cringe-inducing lines unbecoming of a two-time academy award winning actress. Kruger (played by Sharlto Copley of District 9 fame) is meant to be a fun-to-watch villain, but Delacourt's personal mercenary has an incredibly obnoxious, pseudo-French/cockney accent that would be hilarious in a Monty Python movie, but it's distracting and less than intimidating in this one. The actors are not entirely to blame; it's difficult for a good actor/actress to perform well when given poor lines.

The environments, spaceships, robots, and weapons are a visual treat, as expected. The action scenes have inventive elements, but they are too few and far between, often relying heavily on slow-motion. Ultimately, the film lacks character development and substance, both of which are essential for the kind of story Blomkamp is trying to tell.

Considering how great District 9 was, and the enormous potential Elysium had, it's obvious Blomkamp has some great ideas; it's just a matter of allowing them to develop. 4/10",1379980800,12,2790,5.232662192393736

If you happen to disagree that the future of capitalism will lead to a widening rift between upper and lower class, you are going to find this film highly unpalatable.  ""Elysium"" drives this point home with a capital ""E"".  But if you are willing to entertain the idea that the increase of have nots is a trend, ""Elysium"" is here to tell you that by 2154 Earth is going to turn into a toilet.

Our protagonist Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) is a man from a difficult past trying to make good by following the rules.  Well, almost -- he's still a wise ass, particularly when it comes to being interrogated by the robots that enforce the law in a world teeming with crowded humanity.  Once we see what Da Costa does for a living it's easy to see why; he BUILDS the same robots that oppress him. After mouthing off to a bot and getting his arm broken, Da Costa crosses paths with his old childhood flame, Frey (Alice Braga).  Frey's daughter Matilda is dying of leukemia, but that's not enough to motivate Da Costa to risk his life to save her.  And her salvation lies in a Stanford torus known as Elysium, where the rich live with robot servants and cure-all medbays that fix every conceivable ill.

A word about Elysium from Greek myth, an afterlife for demigods and heroes, from Pindar's Odes:

...the good receive a life free from toil, not scraping with the strength of their arms the earth, nor the water of the sea, for the sake of a poor sustenance. But in the presence of the honored gods, those who gladly kept their oaths enjoy a life without tears, while the others undergo a toil that is unbearable to look at.

The ""toil that is unbearable to look at"" is Earth.  Da Costa finds himself irradiated in a blatant EHS violation that ensures he'll be dead in five days.  With nothing to lose, he reconnects with former criminal employer Spider (Wagner Moura), a near unintelligible gangster with big plans.  He regularly smuggles the desperate to Elysium so they get a chance at healing, but with Da Costa he has bigger plans: the kidnapping of an executive.  Da Costa agrees on one condition.  He wants to go after the CEO of the company where Da Costa was irradiated, CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner).  The catch is that Carlyle is in the midst of a coup against Elysium by Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster, sporting an odd French accent). When Da Costa ambushes Carlyle and downloads his brain, he picks up more than he bargained for, and thus a cat-and-mouse game enuses between Da Costa and sleeper agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley, nearly unintelligible with his accent).  Kruger's chasing Da Costa, and Da Costa's chasing a dream, saddled by guilt that the love of his life's daughter will die soon if he doesn't do something.

And oh yeah, Da Costa wears an exoskeleton that has some Christ-like allegories if you squint at Damon when he stretches his arms out.

What ensues is a lot of shaky-cam combat in director Neill Blomkamp's trademark dirty sci-fi universe, the same backdrop that was so effective in ""District 9.""  This is an ugly war in an ugly place, and ""Elysium"" doesn't have many nice things to say about just about everyone involved.  But that's what makes it so compelling, and what makes the film worth watching.  Yes, there's often some logic leaps between scenes, and the transition between scenes and sets seems to be so tenuous as to be nearly ethereal, but this message movie has an interesting tale to tell if we're willing to listen...cybernetics and gunfights not withstanding.",1378252800,10,3647,4.665625
5914855,4,B00EHK2S04,"I had the same feeling of general letdown that most of you had, and I didn't even see District 9 to get pumped up about it!  But, the relentless marketing of Elysium prepared me for something grander and more interesting than what I got.  The cover of Entertainment Weekly, for example, way back in May, that read ""Neill Blonkamp Saves the Summer Blockbuster.""

If not for that letdown, I'd give this show an A +.  Any movie that puts Jodie Foster in it--here at her most scary and all too human a role, a capitalist driven to shady measures--rather like the part she played in the Spike Lee movie about the heist--any movie with Jodie in it automatically gets a pass from me because she is a genius actor!  Matt Damon is not so lucky, and I don't mean even to hint at the spoilers, but I just mean his role is sort of undeveloped and just like the working class of the world he rarely gets to speak his mind or change expression.  However maybe I'm wrong, because Diego Luna as Julio, Max's best friend, is very expressive, almost languid like Oscar Wilde, and lacks the bruises and welts the makeup artists have painted all over Matt's body.  He seems to have wandered in from another movie, perhaps one that Merchant and Ivory were about to make when they died.

The movie seems to pivot on the great coincidence of Matt wandering into the only emergency ward in which his childhood sweetheart happens to be working and happens to be on staff.  What?  Well, they were careful to make the point that few medical services exist to help out the poor, but still!  Earth is supposed to be so severely overpopulated there aren't enough resources for anybody.  If I was Alice Braga, I'd change my agent!  Alice, you're great in this as Fray the nurse with the cute little girl Matilda, but you were also great playing the exact same role in I Am Legend years ago, and maybe these post apocalyptic spectacles are killing the thing that made you Alice Braga.  You don't want your audience to remember you in these parts, but that's what they're going to do, in 2054, when they're old men but still remembering when they were fifteen and saw their first Brazilian woman on screen.",1378252800,4,2173,4.510204081632653
5914856,3,B00EHK2S04,"While I by no means disliked Elysium, I also can't say that anything about it stood out to me either. Matt Damon did a decent enough job, but I just couldn't invest quite enough in his character to really care either. But to be perfectly honest, I also wasn't watching this movie hoping for the next great dramatic acting performances, I was watching it because I wanted to see a badass sci-fi/action flick, and for the most part Elysium delivered on that level.

At least in my opinion Elysium is more of a Redbox movie than it is one that you'd need to own a copy of.",1377993600,2,569,4.317757009345795
5914857,1,B00EHK2S04,"I really liked the commercial for this movie, so I ended up watching it. i thought this movie would be great, where Matt is going to up there and save the day and all. He did do that but the movie made him to be too much of a selfish jerk and by the time he did save everyone, I just didn't care! The movie also focuses on too much of the polite background in this movie. Time and time again, we have to hear and see about the reason why Elysium is chaos. There is a power struggle from within and on Earth too. But, the main politice is within and who is in power and there is a LOT of backstabbing going around. After watching all that, I really didn't care to see Matt save the day as, I thought they should all just die! I will NOT recommend this movie.",1377734400,18,757,3.954248366013072
5914858,3,B00EHK2S04,"While I enjoyed the movie more than my wife, it's not compelling.

Matt Damon is the protagonist in this film and we learn right away he's loyal with a wild streak and that he's been this way since childhood.  The movie starts with his character experiencing a mishap that makes him desperate while in the process of rebooting his life.

It would have  been nice to know where his skills came from beyond a cppl of side comments.  More importantly we never get a clear grasp on how the situation between Earth and Elysium degraded to the current level.  Jody Fosters character starts out terrible and gets worse from their in a way that requires character building so the viewer isn't left questioning scenes and actions during the movie..

""add some layers"" if you like, to both Damon and Foster's characters, not a lot, just a wee bit more would have been nice.

Sharlto Copley of District 9 fame is also a significant part of this movie and while his character rises well above both Matt Damon's & Foster's in being the most memorable it's not because of what he was given but in what he does with it, his role requires the least amount of depth yet I got the impression I knew him better than the rest by the end.

this movie had 2 hours to tell a story... a really strong story that could have built a strong emotional tie to the audience and while it doesn't waste it (too harsh a word), Elysium does squander several opportunities that would/could have made it epic.

If I was to condense Elysium down to one impression, it'd be ""rushed.""

It wasn't for lack of time that it came across as rushed but much more in the choices made regarding characters relationship & interaction that ate up valuable time that could have been used differently.

I liked the movie, it's a solid 3 of 5 stars and I'd be really interested in seeing an extended version if only to see if Elysium had heart that was lost during editing.",1377561600,3,1921,4.472779369627507
5914859,3,B00EHK2S04,"For a film called Elysium, directed by Neill Blomkamp, there sure doesn't seem to be that many images or scenes of life there. Like 90 percent of the film takes place on a future ravaged, over-polluted, industrialized Earth focusing on Max Da Costa, played by Matt Damon or in a closed room on Elysium focusing on the elites of Elysian society including the secretary of defense Jessica Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster. I'll admit, it was a huge letdown for me. When I went to see this film last night and there were only a few scenes, mostly at the beginning and end, that focused on the beauty and luxury of Elysium. I went in to the theater thinking it would be the next visual masterpiece like Avatar or Life of Pi but instead it was much more like District 9, also directed by Blomkamp, and Children of Men in it's gritty atmosphere and violence. That's not to say I hated Elysium, because aside from the lack of scenes focusing on Elysium, it was a very impressive film. The action scenes and much of the futuristic technology are very cool, creative, and fun to watch. The themes of the film revolve around class, immigration, and healthcare, specifically in the USA in regards to Mexican and other Latin American immigrants. The story takes place in the year 2154 and revolves around Max trying to get to Elysium so that he won't die after getting hit with lethal doses of radiation during a tragic accident at work.

The rich people living on Elysium, who are mostly white by the way, have very long life expectancies and no disease due to medical technology that quickly and painlessly cures any illness, and also has the ability to reconstruct damaged body parts. This technology is completely absent on Earth and because of this, and the high rate of disease and violence, many Earth citizens try desperately to get to Elysium, even if it's through illegal means, in order to cure themselves or escape the hell that Earth has become. It very similar to how many Mexicans try to cross the border illegally into America for a better chance at life and better healthcare. In fact, most of the Earth citizens are Hispanic in appearance and the film, rather than taking place on Elysium, mostly takes place in a future Los Angeles. In addition to Max, other important characters include Frey, played by Alice Braga a woman who was friends with Max as kids and has a daughter suffering from Leukemia, and Kruger, a vicious mercenary played by Sharlto Copley, who is the main villain of the film. He was excellent in his role, and as many others have noted, was one of the best characters in the film. The strongest point of this film, I believe, is the message that I took out of it, that any society where people are divided, whether it be class, color, caste, or even gender, is a failed society in the long run because it will only lead to anger, hatred, and violence that affects everyone, regardless of whether they're at the top or bottom of society. A truly great society is a society where everyone is equal, and no one truly believes they are above anyone else. Elysium may look like a beautiful paradise, but such a paradise can only last for so long when the world below looks as it does in this film.

5914861,4,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium is the name of an orbiting satellite. It has a controlled environment and is where the rich and powerful live. The United States has been reduced to a land of illegals in an extension of class warfare. Health care is different for the rich than the poor. The ""illegals"" attempt to go to Elysium to get health care. The film also is an extension of surveillance drones, automated robots, and how computers run the world.

In an unusual role Jodi Foster plays Delacourt, the emotionless Secretary of Defense who protects Elysium. At times she is similar to Jack Nicholson in ""A Few Good Men"" and really needed to be more like him. It was not a good role for her. Matt Damon plays Max in his usual man against the system. After an industrial accident, Max has 5 days to live and opts to join the resistance against the powers of Elysium.

I have not read the book, but you can tell from the film that the book was better as there are massive parallels to today's society which most likely the film couldn't incorporate them all. Yet at the same time, I felt a bit bogged down by the overtness of this morality film.

5914862,3,B00EHK2S04,"What's good: Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, of course. Neither one could hit a wrong note if they had a week to practice.  And, if actors are anything like human beings, the best bring the rest up to their level. Not meaning to give co-stars less than their due, I'm sure it happened here. Add in a dramatic script with all the right elements (evil uber-class, downtrodden masses, underground movement poised to strike) and it just gets better. Then pour buckets of money into effects. You're going to see something good come out of the pipeline, and this time you surely do. Action, underdogs become overlords, and gross social inequality undone. Pass the popcorn and it's all good.

What's not: Well, plausibility. The minute overclass living on the backs of vast numbers of serfs - well, it's been true, or has acquired enough truthiness to pass casual inspection. Then those guys wearing the conspicuous super-suits. C'mon, didn't anyone think that someone tricked out that way might warrant extra confinemnent? No? OK, you're  a scriptwriter. And all the economics of granting the whole world every advance that modern medicine (their modern) can offer? Well, have a chat with Malthus before you nail down your conclusions.

So, apply your depth gauge. The first few inches in, it's magnificent, well-played, the kind that pulls you in and keeps you there. Don't go past the first few inches, though - you won't find much. It's good entertainment, but just entertainment.

5914864,1,B00EHK2S04,"There are some humorous scenes between Matt Damon and droid characters in the opening moments which give promise that this will be a smart, funny, enjoyable sci-fi pic.  Alas, it was not to be.  Very soon, the film turns deadly serious, deadly dumb, deadly dull, and, well... just plain deadly.

In this installment of the classic struggle between Haves and Have-Nots, the Haves are Rich Evil White People, who run and continue to wreck the Earth from their paradise space station, Elysium,  the 22nd century version of the gated suburban community.  Meanwhile, the Have-Nots are poor but caring people of color, mostly Hispanic, who seem to want nothing more than to care for their children, many of whom seem to be falling ill.

Somehow, Matt Damon finds himself in this mix as the would-be hero of the Have-Nots.  Why?  Because Matt Damon is a top box office action star, and there be action coming!  Still, Matt Damon isn't quite bad-ass enough, so they shave his head and rough him up a little so he looks like a mini Bruce Willis.  Let the action commence!

What the Have-Nots seem to covet most about Elysium is the access to free and perfect health care.  Every McMansion in the rich white suburban world has a medical device in the living room that can miraculously cure any ailment, in seconds.  Childhood Leukemia?  No problemo.  Lie down in this MRI-looking device and whoosh! The 1970's style digital readout now flashes, ""Cancer cells 100% cleared!""  My microwave doesn't even work that fast.

Is this sounding political enough yet?  Wait, there's more!  The poor but caring people of color try desperately to get to Elysium to save their ailing children, but alas, the Rich Evil White People have a Department of Homeland Security (run by Jodie Foster playing the Michele Bachman-type-conservative-bitch character) that ruthlessly cracks down on such ""illegal immigration"" by shooting their ships out of the sky.  And, in a subtle nod to the Truther movement, they use a rogue CIA-type spy to act as a terrorist and shoot down the planes of the people of Earth.

The plot gets really convoluted when Matt Damon's character, Max, gets exposed to radiation after an Evil White Person forces him to do something dangerous on the job.  Damon is given 5 days to live, but the health care on Elysium could save  him.  So a plot is hatched with the people of color to kidnap an Important Evil White Person and download his brain which has some software code that will control everything on Elysium.  Will Damon and his Hispanic cohorts make it to Elysium to save himself and the people of Planet Earth?  Who cares.

The storyline and characters are so silly and paranoid and one-dimensional that all that's left to care about are the action sequences and special effects.  It becomes like watching a bad video game.  The fighting scenes are interminable and so over the top that they border on self-parody.  You would think that by the 22nd century the technology of violence would have advanced to the point where it would be quick, quiet and efficient, like a zap from a ray-gun.  But that would be no fun to watch, so here the weapons are bigger, louder and inflict more gory damage.  Fortunately, there are  high tech gizmos to fix you up, so the fighting can continue another round.  In one scene, Damon, whose huge machine guns and bazookas have been unsuccessful in killing the main bad guy, explodes a grenade in his face.  All that is left is some bloody bones.  But wait!  His comrades run him through the trusty Facial Reconstruction Machine, and faster than you can say, ""Yeah, right, what a crock"", voila! He is as good as new, and ready for the next action scene.

This is what happens when you give a film-maker a bad script and too much money.  For much better movies on a similar theme, check out Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, and Blade Runner.  Someday Matt Damon will be embarrassed that he was in this movie.  I am already embarrassed that I watched it until the end.",1377216000,155,4000,4.714285714285714

Elysium is the satellite in the earth's orbit where the wealthy live. They have everything that money can buy: beautifully landscaped estates, computerized living, even scans that cure illnesses.

5914868,3,B00EHK2S04,"Writer and director Neill Blomkamp (District 9) pulled off his second project with a lot of grace, but not a lot of passion. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the implied futuristic technology is amazingly impressive (although unfortunately for the human race now, justification), but the characters are typically what you would expect. The underdog with a dream, an adult mentor as a child, a mean and evil villain (government official - who else), an ambitious sidekick gone rogue...etc.. And again, what's with all the hand-held camera work and gratuitous street fights every film is having this days. In this film I really felt I was watching a CG enhanced version of Rockem'Sockem'Robots. It was a little old after a while.

All that aside, there were some really good performances. Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting, The Departed) plays Max, who we learn from the beginning, is the kid from the slums who wants to get out and live where the rich people live. Where there is no sickness, diseases or stress. Oh and yes he has his childhood girlfriend who now has a daughter, who is ill (incentive to go to Elysium), who he still does pine for her still even 20 years later.

Now what is Elysium? It's an elite, beautiful, and militarily protected by the government, orbiting space station where the truly elite, truly rich people of the human race now reside. There are medical devices where you simply just lie down in and with a scan of your body that takes but a second or two, and whether you have a pimple or full blown cancer and everything (literally everything) in between it is cured all within seconds! I wish!

Guess where Matt Damon, his girlfriend Alicia Braga (I Am Legend, City of God) and her sickly daughter Emma Tremblay (Her first film) want to go? Of course running the defense side of the ""Homeland Security"" of the station was the most impressive performance in the film as done by Jodi Foster (Silence of the Lambs, Contact). She assigns Sharlto Copley (District 9, The A Team) to hunt, find and kill all three of them. Did I mention Matt gets suited up with a bio electrically connected suit that we get to see surgically implanted into his head and body? Yummy!

Now throw in another dark character and amazing performance by William Fichtner (Contact, Armageddon) as the programmer of Elysium, who along with Jodi Foster, want to re program the government and take over from the current president played by Faran Tahir (Star Trek -2009, Iron Man), and you have several time bombs set in the story.

Throw in yet another very cool performance by Wagner Moura (Elite Squad 1 & 2) as the underground resistance trying to take over Elysium because the rest of the planet Earth is now a wasted, polluted and disease ridden garbage can. The film has a few surprises, of course, and some great CG work, but other than Foster, Fitchtner and Moura's performances being very intense, Matt is Matt. He is the action hero with a chip on his shoulder and mission to complete. It ended as it should and left nothing really to the imagination.

The space station Elysium itself is impressive as well as their medical technology portrayed in this film but not a whole lot of meat or heart. There is lots of explosions and fighting, not much more of the more interesting aspects of the society or their technology. Good fun, nice effects, lots of gratuitous fighting, nothing really more.",1377129600,4,3404,4.7318718381112985
5914869,3,B00EHK2S04,"In Elysium, vast discrepancies of wealth have separated off the very rich to Elysium, a vast orbiting station,to enjoy a blissful, free-from-care world; on earth the vast majority are consigned to overpopulated cites full of disease and decay. Jodie Foster is defence minister in the government on Elysium. She is responsible for the shooting down of airships not cleared to come into Elysium airspace. Down on earth Matt Damon plays Max the tough ex-convict scratching a living in a factory, and as an ex -criminal is required to report to a robot parole officer. Neil Blomkamp the director made a previous sci-fi film on a small budget(District 9)which made a massive impact. The risk is that the follow up will with a bigger budget get smaller audiences. Was he only able to get funding for a sci-fi movie when he wanted to make a different movie? This film's heart is in the right place: the way we treat healthcare, immigrants. Healthcare should it seems to say be free at the point of use. This is sci-fi of a kind of wish fulfilment of present needs,not an attempt to predict what will occur in the future. Blomkamp is really interested in the present. What's going on with healthcare, what's going on with gated communities? Was this the right way to deal with these issues? For Blomkamp it seems so. With science fiction, we are able to divorce ourselves from the modern context and see what we really think about the underlying issues.

Lots of the sci-fi comes to us second hand, we've seen a lot of this before(Johnny Nmemonic, Robocop).Their one desire, Max and his childhood sweetheart and her ailing daughter, is to get to Elysium, and it's not that interesting once they get there what they do with it. With sci-fi you want cleverness in the use of technology, the main plot point here is they go after someone without knowing who it is (an Elysium bigwig )to get a crucial piece of data. The big thing in this movie is his main villain Sharlto Copley is a South African, and he's as nasty as they come. Matt Damon gives a very solid, physical performance(and is the major draw).Jodie Foster starts off promisingly but is given nothing to do. Spider(Maura) is like the creative midfield player in football, essential for effecting transitions, plot points in a suitably colourful manner. Of course Blomkamp is very good on shoot'em ups and gadgetry like the exosleton Max wears to give his shortened life more strength, but this is not what the best sci-fi is about(Stalker, Solaris),where we are tipped into deep thought with few specialeffects. He is good at grainy, downtrodden worlds. Los Angeles is like Mexico City and the vast majority seem to speak Spanish. A third world polluted planet. But what lets it down? As a story the action dominated character and plot to the detriment of the film, which poorly scripted gives no exploration of the earth environment or that of Elysium and breaks out into formulaic robotics, extinguishing the satiric spark.",1377043200,2,2976,4.8125
5914870,5,B00EHK2S04,"Science Fiction, sometimes called speculative fiction, has always based itself in today's concerns and projected them into the future. Anyone who doubts this has only to read Heinlein, Bradbury, Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Herbert and many others. Watch Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, The Adjustment Bureau, Star Wars etc., etc. It's always the apparently powerless fighting long odds against an oppressive or much greater force either for their own good or for the good of a class of people. It will always be political, particularly the bigger epics. If you side with the more powerful, you'll hate the upstarts, but most people fall into the 99% and cheer for the little guy. I know I do. It's simplistic to tag this or most films with a political/economic label. My heart (and that of most audiences) is going to be with whoever has to fight for his life against those who want to keep all the good for themselves. Elysium does this well like the best scifi. You root for Damon's character. What elevates Elysium is the acting of both Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley, in particular. And I'm always going to love Jodie Foster no matter what she does.

I love a good action flick that tells a story I can get involved in,particularly one that pays such close attention to artistic detail. My only criticism is that it wasn't shot in 3-D. Damon says it should not have been and so was shot in 2-D. I respectfully disagree. The story is solid, the action lends itself to immersion, and the views of Elysium itself and the ruined Earth should have been in depth, the way it would be in real life.

But I won't quarrel with the director's choice. The story, the action, the speculation, the science are all grounded in ""could be possible"" and make me shiver. The actors are exceptional. Our movie money was well spent. Bravo Blomkamp, Damon et. al. You have my vote that you all make another one together.

I will update this when the blu-ray is released.",1376956800,8,1961,4.678260869565217
5914871,4,B00EHK2S04,"Elysium is like a combination of ""District 9"", ""Terminator"" and
""Bourne"" movies all in one.  The hand to hand fight sequences are as good as those in the ""Bourne"" movies.  The mood, premise and robots remind me of the ""Terminator"" movies.  The settings of villages and towns on earth have a feel like the ""District 9"".

Take all this and add good special effects, great graphics, good story line and decent acting from Jodie Foster and Matt Damon you have a movie worth seeing.

Yes, as someone has pointed out there is definitely a political point being made here in the story.  This story is taking on the present political situation and moving it into the future. There is nothing wrong with that and I would go as far as saying ""I am glad they made the movie"".  Good stories quite often have a moral value or lesson to learn or perhaps instruct us on what we should be aware of in our current political environment.  And this is what makes this a good movie.  I suppose as someone pointed out the person portraying ""Delacourt"" by Jodie Foster may have a striking resemblance to Hillary Clinton, but it also could be Sara Palin.  However, who ever made the claim is not far off- base. After all Hillary Clinton did say on her website in a bid for running as President for the Democratic Party in 2008, ""I represent Wall Street"".  Given all of this to be true you will have some people who will react in a negative sense to the story.  But, it makes me wonder how they would react to movies such as ""THX 1138"", ""1984"" or the ""Time Machine"".  In the story of the ""Time Machine"" the Morlocks are capitalist who flee underground with their machines and prey upon the Eloi who are workers that stayed above ground. The first movie with Rod Taylor is close to the book, but the book goes into better detail than what I am explaining. Read the book.

In comparing the Elysium's story to the ""Time Machine"" I would give it a close 4.  However balancing this out with everything else previously mentioned I would give the whole movie a 4   stars.

5914872,4,B00EHK2S04,I went and saw this movie on Friday and it was actually a very good movie not great but not bad either. The movie is a little slow at times it seemed like it was missing something unlike District 9 which was a great movie. The scary thing about Elysium is I see Los Angeles slowly turning out this way where most of the population is Mexican and the city is in ruins possibly from a major earthquake. The movie was very intense at times I was hoping it wasn't going to be too over the top violent but it wasn't too bad.,1376956800,4,519,4.048543689320389
5914873,4,B00EHK2S04,"""Elysium"" is a classic story being told in a not entirely new fashion. It's the classic story of power overwhelming the powerless; those with money and opportunity monopolizing that opportunity and leaving those without to squander through their existences. Much of ""Elysium"" rings true today and since this film is set 140-years from now, its realism and possibility aren't beyond belief. Earth's natural resources have dried up and so the haves, or the hugely wealthy, built a space station called ""Elysium"" and left the rest behind. Max DeCosta (Damon) is a typical blue-collar worker whos circumstances send him through a fast and faster escalating series of life changing events.

Everything about ""Elysium"" is well done, all the way down to the casting of two children who look exactly like Damon's character and Frey (Alice Braga), Max's childhood friend. The story is constantly changing and engrossing. It was quite simply the fastest 109 minutes I have spent at the movies in a long time. Your heart is invested in the characters and the ruthlessness and power of the bad guys gives you a constant feeling of danger and overwhelming odds; just as a movie like this should.

It isn't a deal breaker, but like ""Oblivion"" and many other movies that have come out in recent years or months, ""Elysium"" is a collage of many movies that have come before; ""Johnny Mneumonic"", ""Robo Cop"", ""In Time"" and ""Mad Max"", with a heavy emphasis on ""Johnny Mneumonic"". Despite this though, the movie has legitimacy about it and all of its elements are well thought out. This adds to the beauty of the film and it is beautiful. From the personalities that it explores to the plite, ""Elysium"" is a power film.

Other than some overzealous shaky camera moments that I continue to hate in every movie I see them, ""Elysium"" is more satisfying than all of the superhero movies that came out his summer put together. I understand the art form that is shaky camera, but to have the camera shaking to the extent that you actually think about what the cameraman is doing to make it shake so much, it is bad. ""Elysium"", despite this, is the kind of movies that we all should be going to see. It's the kind of movie that Hollywood needs to be making more of because it sticks with you and doesn't leave you with the constant unsatisfied feeling you get from the superhero movies.",1376870400,3,2358,4.76039119804401
5914874,3,B00EHK2S04,"Matt Damon is now jumping into the realm of superhero blockbuster mode.  Yes...I'm aware he portrayed Jason Bourne, but that's on a different level in comparison.  Nevertheless, Elysium had that same District 9 worldy atmospheric feel, a feel the Director invites everyone to revisit.  The movie dives right into the story showcasing this futuristic present day world we live in, and it's not pretty.  Los Angeles is the futuristic city, and it's filled with poverty, war, crime, pollution, disease, and overpopulation.  Robots similar to the District 9 prototypes police and monitor the inhabitants of Los Angeles and beyond.

 Meanwhile, Elysium is situated and isolated outside Planet Earth but visually seen with the naked eye from Earth as if you're peering up at the Moon.  What is it?  Elysium is an isolated futuristic crafted bio-dome designed for the elitist individuals of society that want nothing to do with the state of affairs happening on Plant Earth.  To fast forward in my review - It held my attention - the casting was sound - Sharlto Copley was on the docket as he was the lead in District 9.  The story had some over-the-top scenes - it dragged a bit toward the end with the endless fight scenes and cat and mouse shenanigans.  The movie ended in a ""positive"" direction, but it had major realistic flaws ending in the direction it did.

*SPOILER*

Even if all citizens on Planet Earth now had access to Elysium, and it's healing capabilities...... that doesn't necessarily make the world a better place.  The Planet was overpopulated to begin with, therefore nothing resolves this overpopulation crisis if you start healing everyone of ailments.....Secondly, this movie had subtleties shining a light on Mexicans overpopulating and destroying Los Angeles - I do hope that was NOT the Director's intent, and if it was he has a backwards and flawed view of the future of our Planet.",1376784000,4,1902,4.974683544303797
5914875,3,B00EHK2S04,"Just saw Elysium and it was...ok. Good direction, good actors, decent storyline (even if we've seen the same theme before in plenty of Romero/Carpenter movies). You know, the poor, abused masses, the arrogant elites with all the money and privilege. And it was all moving at a brisk, entertaining clip until the last ten minutes. When they decide to get all sappy with the emotion, and wrap everything up in a Disney perfect end. Which might have worked with some more back story and character development. Which is so quick, and so picture perfect, it just rings false, and as a bit of a letdown. Not the worst movie of 1013, but hardly the best.",1376784000,5,647,4.6347826086956525
5914876,5,B00EHK2S04,I read on here that people did not like Elysium and I have no idea how? It was a very well written and acted film and it had a lot of heart. The action was great but not too over the top and the CGI was amazing... This is coming from a guy that does CGI for a living. I was very impressed with the movie over all and I will definitely be picking up a copy of this on blu ray.,1376784000,8,375,3.5853658536585367
5914877,4,B00EHK2S04,"In essence, Elysium is an allegory on our society that pinpoints a few harsh realities.

It is one of the latest big budget movies that try to hit ""the poor versus the rich"" nail on the head: The fact that the gap between the social classes has been continually growing over the years is common knowledge. More alarming and lesser known fact is that the number of billionaires has increased in the first decade of the 21st century at an unprecedented rate. Elysium cunningly mirrors what current trends may lead to in a grim and merciless yet plausible future. Throughout the film one realizes we are already living in that future.

Elysium is simply a heaven and a haven for billionaires. Set in space, in proximity to earth, it is a state of the art space station that inhabits only the richest of the rich in five stars living conditions, whereas the rest of humanity lives on earth, poorer and more miserable than ever.
The film deals with the dreams and efforts of the poor to reach Elysium to get better life and access magical medical treatment device that can cure all diseases and prolong life expectancy.

Our protagonist, Max (Matt Damon), has always wanted to reach Elysium. Unfortunately as an adult he has to get there to save his own life, after absorbing a lethal dosage of radiation in an exploitative sweatshop-like factory owned and managed by one the above mentioned billionaires. The price of obtaining a ticket up is engaging in a highly violent and deadly mission to capture and deliver information that same billionaire possesses. It turns out that this information may be the key to miraculously change the harsh reality for everybody for good...

In all, recommended mostly for the Sci-Fi and action fans that can appreciate sharp social criticism.",1376611200,17,1774,4.8256578947368425
5914878,5,B00EHK2S04,I was initially reluctant to go see this movie seeing the director was responsible for what I consider one of the worst movies ever but the trailers were too much so I ended up at the imax theater to watch this movie.

Well done on all accounts it has displaced Star Trek as my favorite movie so far this year.,1376611200,10,391,4.0519480519480515

Not to spoil it with details but basically, the Haves(white rich people) live on Elysium and the Have nots(poor Mexicans) live on earth. People on Elysium have it all, top of the line everything, including machines that can heal any ailment a human could have. People on earth basically have nothing. You get the picture. The plot is extremely predictable and shallow. Too many flashbacks.  As another reviewer stated, you can figure out how it will end midway through.  The only thing this movie has going for it is Copley's performance as the antagonist, top notch for sure.

Blomkamp should have just made the District 9 sequel instead, which is what most people(myself included) going to see this movie really want anyway.",1376611200,14,871,4.748344370860927
5914880,4,B00EHK2S04,"ELYSIUM is a highly enjoyable movie, and could not be more timely. While it falls just a bit shy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-9/dp/B002WTOXUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District 9</a>'s brilliance, it still makes for a great movie experience.

It is the year 2154, and Earth has been divided into two classes of humans: those who ""HAVE"" live on the cusp of space on a gorgeous circular space station known as Elysium. Those who ""HAVE NOT"" are packed into the overcrowded, miserable planet of Earth, where nothing works, living conditions are miserable, and the entire planet's population are not even called ""citizens."" Worse yet, medical care is miserable at best on Earth, but up on Elysium technology exists that cures any disease, instantly.

It's no wonder everyone is trying to emigrate off the surface of the planet to get there. The only problem is that Elysium doesn't look kindly upon those who try to invade its borders, and those who attempt it often die in the process. Sure, the metaphor can be a little heavy handed at times, but if that doesn't worry you then this movie will be perfect for you.

As far as special effects and cinematography, I loved DISTRICT 9, and I was similarly impressed with the ELYSIUM. The former film proved that director and writer Neill Blomkamp is amazing when it comes to working with seamless cinema technology, and this is a skill that is equally prominent in ELYSIUM - especially given his $100 million budget. The grainy, downtrodden worlds are extremely similar, but ELYSIUM goes one better with its depiction of the futuristic and beautiful space station - named after the mythical Hellenic afterlife realm where those who led heroic lives went to spend a careless afterlife. Blomkamp said he had to look no further than America's own Beverly Hills for his model of unapologetic boundless wealth.

I also loved the actors: Matt Damon is terrific as always, playing the reluctant hero Max with anything BUT a heart of gold. Jodi Foster is also fine as Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt - I loved seeing her play against type as a heartless bureaucrat with an interesting accent to boot. Sharlto Copley - who played the sympathetic bumbling hero of DISTRICT 9 - tears up the screen here as Delacourt's deranged triggerman. Also of note was Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, playing a smuggler named Spider, an engaging role that allows him to be both opportunistic and ultimately humanistic.

About the only fault I can find with the film is that ELYSIUM doesn't allow itself time to really get to the core of anything...there's little we feel we know about Damon's character other than the fact that he is perennially on the wrong side of the law. Similarly, we don't get to know anything about Secretary Delacourt - or her political counterpart President Patel - which would have been helpful, as they are continually at odds throughout the film, though we get little or no explanation why.

What we DO get in its place is action...lots of it...especially in the second half of the film. This is enjoyable, but a little more fleshing out of the roles might have made for a little more satisfying film. DISTRICT 9 didn't have a lot of explanation behind it, either, but its spare storyline didn't need it. Here, the movie gets by on a similarly slight back story, but a little more would have helped.",1376524800,8,3410,4.984182776801406
5914881,2,B00EHK2S04,"After enjoying District 9, I was really looking forward to this movie.  Unfortunately, it pales in comparison.  This film is set 140 years into the future where the have nots, called 'Illegals' live  in cramped diseased conditions on what resembles Industrial Revolution conditions on Earth with the triage equivalent of medical treatment.  While the haves, called 'Citizens' live on Elysium, a space station orbiting Earth where they have resort style living and every 'Citizen' has a magical medical machine that cures any ailment and extends their life spans.  Matt Damon's character joins a group of rebels, lead by Spider, a heavily accented hacker, to penetrate the outer defenses of the space station in order to cure himself of radiation poisoning and make everyone a 'Citizen' so they can bring those magical medical machines back to Earth to cure the little sick children (which is the last scene of the movie).

Unfortunately, this movie is nothing more than socialism wrapped in science fiction.  The action is great, but the story is really contrived and hits viewers over the head with it's all too familiar parallels of today's hot political issues in America like illegal immigration and government sponsored healthcare.  And if Jodie Foster's character wasn't based on Hillary Clinton, I don't know who she was supposed to resemble.  Her one line gave it away, 'I'm in charge of this station now Mr. President (who just so happens to be African American)!  Go do one of your campaign fund raisers, which is really what you're good at'.  And then both the director and Matt Damon claim with straight faces, that they weren't trying to make any political statements when creating this movie?  Yeah right! ROFLMAO! If I had known what this movie was going to really be about, I wouldn't have wasted my money and would have gone to see another movie instead.",1376524800,19,1871,4.980707395498392

Elysium is Damon doing the liberal left wing dance... again. This guy should go ahead and enter politics, that is, officially. We all know where he stands and that's fine, but his movies are becoming less and less entertaining. Propaganda films are supposed to be far less expensive... documentaries are supposed to be non-fiction... and political adds for the left are supposed to air on CNBC, posing as news stories. I trusted the director for another gut wrenching film- one that challenged my soul; instead I just feel a sense of blah and nausea. Damon's self righteous blather is just plain boring.

The very wealthy have recreated Beverly Hills in a space station, and the corporations they run are crushing what's left of the world. That fact that one of the last on the space station is Indian is significant; in the novel ""Camp of the Saints"" one of those who makes a last stand for the West is an Indian. Since the rabble have destroyed the Earth they're trying to make it to the space station to destroy it. And why was Matt Damon, apparently the only young white guy left in LA, chosen? He was the only competent guy left. You can read this as the oppressed overthrowing their oppressors; you can also read it as the end of civilization, overwhelmed by immigrants. The maker is laughing, just as he was laughing in ""District 9.""",1376524800,6,856,4.45859872611465
5914885,4,B00EHK2S04,"This is far from a perfect movie. Let's get that clear.  There are characters with no motivation or very little (w-why does Kruger take Frey? Why does Spider suddenly want to fix everything? These aren't impossible questions to answer in character, but I'd have liked *some* gesture toward those), and then there's the how exactly does Max, you know, put on a t shirt that is somehow under that rig? And of course, it's another Straight White American Guy saves the world movie.

However, it's the only movie I've seen this summer where I didn't know the ending after the first ten minutes of the film. Big plus.  The story seems disconnected, but I find it far better than the predictable plots of, say, Iron Man 3 or Pacific Rim.

And it is beautifully filmed. To the point where perhaps the cinematography calls a bit *too* much attention to itself? But all you critics of the shaky cam, at least we didn't get blinded by lightflares like we do in like...every Joss Whedon movie ever?

For people decrying this as Left Wing propaganda, I am sorry, but I can't quite follow your argument.  Primarily because, well...let's look at Patel, right?  Brown-skinned token president of Elysium who worries about how things look, instead of getting things done, and who is completely hamstrung by Delacourt? If that doesn't sound like Right Wing critiques of President Obama, I don't know what does! (And if you look at it, when Congress has just given themselves a free pass from Obamacare, so it's good enough for you and me but not good enough for them, well...Obamacare looks a lot like what Max faces on Earth!)

A lot of the people who dislike it dislike the film for the very reason I like it: Max *isn't* a white knight hero from the get-go.  He's a bit selfish, not super smart, average Joe guy just trying to get by in a terrible world. He's not out to overthrow anything or be a hero.  He resists it throughout the movie.  I felt a lot more for Max than I did for Raleigh Becket in Pacific Rim (a movie of far more racist stereotypes and shallow characterization than this); and considering that I categorically do not like Matt Damon, this was very, very grudgingly given.  I see a lot more of Blade Runner's Deckerd than the other cookie cutter cardboard pretty boy heroes this summer's crop of films have given us.  I went in expecting to hate the movie and ended up loving it--despite its flaws.",1376524800,9,2403,4.599531615925058
5914886,1,B00EHK2S04,"The biggest problem with Elysium is that despite its stunning visuals, it still ends up being a formula-driven, dull, and unimaginative film.
Characters on both sides of the good v. evil spectrum are two-dimensional and exaggerated; we are asked to believe that wealthy people are Nazi-like for no other reason than simply being in the top 1% of the economic scale. The poor, by contrast, are righteous and fighting for a better world. There is no middle ground, and as a result, no plausible or believable people populate this cookie-cutter world.
The movie is also plagued by overused and ineffectual story-telling techniques. We have the usual little kid, in this case a girl, who is in dire need of medical attention, always on the brink of death but never actually in any danger at all. Also present is the ever-overacted computer hacker, whose criminal exterior belies his more noble character, and whose skills at reading and manipulating computer code defy even movie logic - one small glance at millions of lines of hex, and he immediately discerns its a rebooting program to reset the entire space habitat known as Elysium.
Half way through the film, we know how everything will turn out; we know who will live and who will die; we know how the good guys will defeat the bad guys, and saddest of all, we still have to sit through another 45 minutes of pointless action to arrive at the predictable conclusion.
In the end, Elysium feels like a poorly-written sermon on the evils of wealth, with all the extreme simplification of  political parties and not a shred of cleverness to at least make it entertaining.",1376438400,79,1620,4.827338129496403

Everyone else must live in a slum type environment in LA, where everyone, including Matt Damon, speaks spanish.  The ex-con teams up with an organized crime boss (Spider) to break into Elysium.

This movie has a similar feel to District 9 but with a bigger budget and more star power. Money and actors are definitely not the way to an instant classic but it definitely helps in this case, especially when the star power is Matt Damon.

This is the kind if movie that gives me hope that I can enjoy the sci fi genre. It feels to me that scifi rarely gets the Hollywood treatment, and when it does it is full of cliches and melodrama. I am happy to say that this movie is an exception.

What I really appreciated with this movie was that many scenes could have easily gone a certain way but instead the movie makes a slight tweak to liven things up. Even the gun battle sequences seemed to have something fresh to them.

If I had to choose I would still watch district 9 first but this movie was still fantastic. I think that if you are looking at this page because you enjoyed the creators first film then this movie is worth giving a try.

One thing to keep in mind though is that there is a strong political message in this movie. This seems to really enrage people. I understand the placement of the message though it does feel forced and heavy handed.

Of course, the rich white people are all portrayed as cold and heartless and the criminal Mexicans are really good down deep.

The entire premise of this movie is that if they won't give us what we want, we'll just take it and destroy as much as we can of their paradise in the process - very much like what is happening is Los Angeles today.

5914891,3,B00EHK2S04,"I liked Blomkamp's ""District 9"" a lot and couldn't wait to see this. Turns out, I could have.

Here's the scoop. 2154's Earth has pretty much been turned into an ashtray, and all the the elite have moved to Elysium, an orbiting space station. Max (Matt Damon) is a parolee working a crap job in a factory. Lax safety regulations cause him to take a massive dose of radiation. He has five days to worm his way to Elysium to get cured. The job he pulls to do so puts data directly into his brain pan that is meant to stage a coup on their president by Delacourt (Jodie Foster) the secretary. It's all out mayhem.

There is so much to love here. The earth scenes are much like what viewers saw in ""District 9"" with the dust, heat, grit and poverty. These opening scenes are great in depicting the situation. Damon delivers some great dialogue like he was born for it. The factory scenes are easily as good. You feel as though you are there with him. Then things get dicey. Some of the plot points are just plain stupid, inconsistent and unbelievable. Not to spoil but how is it the first rogue ships are set upon immediately when entering Elysium while Spider's ship lands unmolested, even when the heat has been turned up to eleven? I could go on but why bother. Just let it be said that some things happen that will leave you shaking your head.

I'm not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This is well worth seeing, just don't expect a better effort than was ""District 9."" I root for Blomkamp. I think he's a heck of a director. He just isn't a great writer. Had the studio assigned him a script doctor or just someone to write with this would have been an outstanding effort.",1376265600,6,1682,4.36741214057508
5914892,5,B00EHK2S04,"""Elysium"" is a futuristic type of film that illustrates what could happen if members of the wealthiest income strata decided to create completely separate living regions from other socio-economic classes.  I truly wish that I could say that what is depicted in ""Elysium"" will never happen on earth and that harmony and unity is going to reign supreme within the next 25 years at the latest. However, it looks like a more unified world may not come about until at least 250 years from now. Additionally, it is becoming even more easy for the top 1% to create their own communities due to the socio-economic and racial segregation that still exists in many middle socio-economic class  and lower socio-economic class neighborhoods across America. There was an element of the immigration debate within the film. I have to confess that I am on the fence and undecided about the immigration issue because I would have to gather more information before making an informed decision on the still controversial matter. ""Matt Damon"" gave a compelling performance as a man who unexpectedly carries the responsibility of making the amenities of Elysium more accessible to a greater number of men and women. Jodie Foster  also gives a brilliant performance as an abrasive and shrewd politician who wants to preserve the culture of ""Elysium"" at even the most extreme of costs.

5914893,5,B00EHK2S04,"Fans of science fiction have been graced these past few years.  At a time when most of us have been too preoccupied with comic book heroes to notice-science fiction has made a stealthy but definitive comeback.  It wasn't giant sagas like Star Wars that kick started the resurgence either, instead it seems to have been brought on by smart, well written smaller budget or independent films.  As a long time science fiction fan, I welcome its return to relevance.

I mention ""District 9"" in this review not only because it shares the same director-but also because I credit D9 as the beginning of the Sci-fi comeback.  With District 9, Neill Blomkamp gave us a wholy original, intelligent take on the genre and showed us something we hadn't seen before.  Subsequent small films like ""Moon"", ""Monsters"" and even ""Attack The Block"" (among others) solidified science fiction's triumphant return.  And though there has been a wealth of smaller quality Science Fiction films It didn't hurt that the big boys like the Star Trek Reboot films, Pacific Rim, Prometheus & the remakes of Total Recall and Dredd were also a return to form.

Elysium gloriously keeps the resurgence going.  Though it shares a great deal of DNA with its older brother District 9-Eylsium benefits from a bigger budget.  Thankfully, that bigger budget always serves to ADD to the story rather than to detract from it and the film as a whole is a truly enjoyable experience from start to finish.  There's something about Blomkamp's directing (I can't quite put my finger on it) that gives his films a sense of gritty realism.  Though what you're seeing on the screen is make believe, it seems fully plausible and real, as if it really is happening right before your eyes.  I was in awe during several scenes of the film even though there were no giant space battles or marching enemy armies or anything even resembling such in sight.  There is just a sense of wonder and awe present throughout the film and it's all in the way the director presents the material.  This was true for District 9 as well but its even more evident in Elysium.  I'm not going to go into plot details or anything like that in this review-I really just wanted to say what a breath of fresh air it was to experience something so new amidst the summer bloat-buster season (Hey, I like the big budget stuff as well as the next guy-but there's still something to be said about story over explosions)

I can't wait to see what Blomkamp has up his sleeve next.  I just hope it's another sci-fi gem like Elysium.  I could also see this guy becoming the next Guillermo Del Toro or Joss Whedon.  He's gonna do some big things in his career.",1376179200,15,2671,4.654584221748401

5914896,2,B00EHK2S04,"""Elysium"" is A dull sermon about Obamacare and open borders in the guise of a so-so Sci-fi flic. The didactic aspect of the film is so heavy-handed it takes you right out of the movie, out of the willing suspension of disbelief. It doesn't help that ""Elysium"" lacks the arresting characters, clever plotting, or wowee special effects that break science fiction films out beyond the genre's diehard fans.

It's 2154 in a dystopic Los Angeles. LA is ugly and garbage-strewn, in a futuristic way. Almost everyone in LA is Hispanic or at least speaks Spanish. Max (Matt Damon), a bald and tattooed ex-con trying to go straight, is forced into taking on a high-risk crime for Spider (Wagner Moura), a crime lord. Max has to travel to Elysium, a space station where rich white Americans live in beauty and luxury, unlike the cursed denizens of earth, who are mostly Hispanic and live in garbage strewn slums and can't get adequate medical care. Elysium has med-beds. If you lie down on a med-bed, no matter what your ailment is, the med-bed will cure you.

Spider is plotting to breach Elysium's security and take it over, thus making med-beds and Elysium's breathtaking beauty available to all. He faces formidable foes.

Jodie Foster is the white, blonde Elysium antagonist. She is trying to protect Elysium from the Hispanic immigrants and sick people in search of health care who are attempting to enter. Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor, is her evil tool. There is no attempt to explain why someone with such a pronounced South African accent lives in LA. In any case, Copley's performance of an enthusiastic sadist is the best thing about the film.

There is a lot of chasing. Men put on metallic costumes that give them special powers. There are your usual hyped up guns and there are also some knives and swords. A lot of this feels like expedient cheating, as it always does in fantasy movies. There are special devices that detect runaways. Max is able to elude these super smart devices by hiding under pigs. The movie never explains, as these movies never explain, the rules of such gadgetry. If a character needs to get away to advance the plot, some trick will help him to get away.

I live in a non-futuristic, garbage-strewn slum. We have had liberal, Democratic government for generations. See Detroit. We've been hearing the same message for generations, the same message ""Elysium"" sends: ""It's us versus them. We are human; they are cold and cruel. They live lives of perfect bliss. Their health problems are all taken care of. They only way for us to achieve anything is to take what they have.""

This message, even in a grade C sci-fi flick, is toxic. Liberals do not help us, the poor, by telling us that we have nothing of value in ourselves, that it is only through taking what the rich have that we can have lives of value. Poor people do not benefit by discounting what they have and living lives of passive, deluded envy, focusing on what the rich have rather than focusing on their own skills and blessings, and cultivating their own opportunities.

If the Earthlings of ""Elysium"" succeeded in their goal, it wouldn't end there. It would end as the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Iranian Revolution and others ended: with terror, torture, rape, chaos, and ""meet the new boss; same as the old boss."" The real revolution starts when we look within and outside ourselves with love.",1376179200,52,3439,4.769747899159664
5914897,4,B00EHK2S04,"This is a rip-roaring action picture, and the most overtly political SF I've ever seen, which is fine by me, so long as the heart is in the right place. And here it is.

In his ""Discourse on Inequality,"" Rousseau holds in essence that inequality develops from the first perceived differences among men, and then is secured by those favored by such perceptions; thereafter inequality begets development and corruption which beget further inequality which begets development and corruption, and so on. The world of 2154, as imagined in ""Elysium,"" is as if Rousseau were confirmed, and apparently by a pessimist to boot. The rich have left the ravaged Earth and its poor behind, to live on a space station, where they hoard all the resources, especially health care. But by the end of the picture we see that writer/director Neill Blomkamp has a more optimistic view of humanity and technology, and the capacity of the latter to serve noble aims. Along the way there are vicious parodies of contemporary inequality, the paranoid security state, the hyper-punitive criminal justice system, immigration paranoia -- pretty much everything out there deserving righteous indignation.

The plot is driven by action sequences almost as much as its central idea. If you think you've seen every gunfight, swordfight, and fistfight you'll ever want to see at the movies, then skip this, because it's got plenty. I thought they were tremendous, tense and involving, with inventive technology. In that regard, I'd say it's up there with the best of them, the best being probably ""Aliens"" and ""District 9."" A comment from another reviewer here, in a generally strong review, suggested that he was less impressed by the weaponry in this film than by ""District 9."" I respectfully disagree: Just as in Blomkamp's breakout film, ""Elysium"" is substantially enhanced by imaginative fight sequences and futuristic weaponry.

Matt Damon does a fine job, even if he's never challenged much by the script. Jodie Foster on the other hand is quite awkward, as if she was nervous or something during the making of it. It's a minor complaint though.

The film isn't subtle, and the broad arc of the storyline is of course predictable (though among genre pics, whose isn't?), but the several steps along the way are not. Anyhow it's not for everyone, but if you've been considering seeing it, don't let the criticism discourage you; see for yourself.",1376179200,7,2419,5.04
5914898,4,B00EHK2S04,"Not quite 5-stars but it's ambitious, fast, thrilling and at times fantastic.

The visuals deliver the goods, just amazing, with a tip of the hat to the gritty look and feel of District 9. Also, and this is key, the fight and action scenes are intense and immersive. You feel like you are in them as you watch.

The plot is the classic Hollywood story split, and suspension of disbelief is a must to get the full ride from this movie. Part of the story takes place on Elysium , a highly secure, space habitat for the rich and wealthy. The other part of the story takes place on a wild and hairy 2154 Earth A.D. These stories evolve on their own and then merge to get the sparks flying.

The acting is solid as you would expect. Everyone gives pretty tight performances that help make the movie that much more entertaining.

In all, good sci-fi entertainment, that does what good sci-fi does: use the future to make you think about the present. It's a solid follow-up to District 9 for this director.

And also, whatever your political beliefs are, set them aside and enjoy. The Day the Earth Stood Still, Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, A Clockwork Orange, Starship Troopers all posed a possible future based on the filmmaker's imagination. I didn't have to agree or disagree to enjoy them. I enjoyed them because they were great stories, great movies.

I look forward to more.

Enjoy!",1376179200,221,1388,4.57258064516129
5914899,5,B00EHK2S04,"More fun than any screed about immigration has any right to be, Elysium is a solid bone-shattering body part scattering action movie. It deals with immigration in an interesting fashion, the salient point being that separating the wealthy from the poor with several kilometers of outer space will not stop the influx of immigrants. Nothing would stop the have nots from wanting a better life, so any argument about the legality of immigration is pointless. What makes Elysium fun are the little details and the awesome screen-devouring presence of Sharlto Copley as Kruger. Sporting a thick Afrikaans accent and a riot of armaments, Kruger appears as likely to murder the audience as those on screen with him. Despite having a military ship and his own private army, he spends his days wearing a cloth sack and rooting through garbage for food. And when activated, he goes from hobo mode to shooting down spaceships in low Earth orbit on a moment's notice. Just fantastic.
There are political points to be made, but Blomkamp understands that an action movie is fun first and foremost.",1376179200,8,1084,4.961538461538462

5914901,5,B00EHK2S04,"""Elysium"" is great! This is how the story goes: In the year 2159, two classes of people exist: the very wealthy, who live on a pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. The people of Earth are desperate to escape the planet's crime and poverty, and they critically need the state-of-the-art medical care available on Elysium - but some in Elysium will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve their citizens' luxurious lifestyle. The only man with the chance bring equality to these worlds is Max, an ordinary guy in desperate need to get to Elysium. With his life hanging in the balance, he reluctantly takes on a dangerous mission - one that pits him against Elysium's Secretary Delacourt and her hard-line forces - but if he succeeds, he could save not only his own life, but millions of people on Earth as well.

The cast led by Matt Damon (as Max) & Jodie Foster (as Delacourt) is great. The directing & story & screenplay by Neill Blomkamp is great.

The music by Ryan Amon is great. The cinematography by Trent Opaloch is great. The film editing by Julian Clarke & Lee Smith is great. The casting by Francine Maisler is great. The production design by Philip Ivey is great. The art direction by Nancy Anna Brown (also did the set designs), Ross Dempster, Don Macaulay & Hania Robledo is great. The set decoration by Peter Lando, set designs by David Clarke & Syd Mead, set dressings by Guy Roland, Liz Medrano, Cody Larson & Patrick Kearns is great. The costume design by April Ferry is great. The special make-up effects supervised by Joe Dunckley & the prosthetic make-up effects supervised by Sarah Rubano are great. The special effects coordinated by John MacCuspie & Cameron Waldbauer & supervised by Richard Taylor is great. The visual effects coordinated by Brendan Byrd, Anita Ho, James Greig, Vivien Hulbert, Ciril Koshyk, Claudia Li, Jaydene Maryk & Curtis Tsai & supervised by Mark Breakspear, Peter Muyzers, Erik Nordby & Stephen Pepper is great. The stunts coordinated by Mike Mitchell is great.

This is a great action-packed sci-fi ride that is entertaining and well-made, as well as, well-done. It is also intriguing and interesting, as well. It is also, visually and thematically, great. This is a great follow-up for Neill Blomkamp after his debut with ""District 9"". Matt Damon is great as usual as Max & Jodie Foster is solid as Delacourt, while Sharlto Copley (as Kruger, reuniting with his ""District 9"" director) gives a great performance, as well. This is one of the best films of the summer season and one of the best action sci-fi films of the year, so far.",1376092800,8,2673,4.819172113289761

5914905,4,B00EHK2S04,"There may be spoilers.

Admittedly I'm pretty much a sucker for anything sci-fi, especially when it has something of a story.  It is an added bonus when the movie isn't a sequel, a spin off or anything with the words ""trans"" in front of it.  Director and writer Neill Blomkamp surprised Hollywood and the public with his 2009 masterpiece, ""District 9"" and after a well-earned hiatus gives us this follow-up.

In the year 2154 the world has evolved into the haves and the have-nots.  The privileged and wealthy now live on a giant man-made space station orbiting Earth.  There is no poverty, no disease, no crime and life is good.  Each home comes equipped with a machine that cures any ailment including those still fatal on Earth.  Earth, or at least Los Angeles - it is the only place depicted - has devolved into a cesspool of poverty and lawlessness.  The planet is in ruins, but people still strive to survive and hope one day to make it to Elysium, the name for the space station.

Max (Matt Damon) is just a regular guy and one of the lucky ones to have a job.  He makes the military robots that keep order on Earth for the Elysium politicians.  Max (Mad?) is accidentally exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and given 5 days to live.  Desperate, he accepts an offer from one of his old criminal allies named Spider (Wagner Moura) that will get him to Elysium for a cure.  After a grueling medical/mechanical operation, Max is equipped with an exoskeleton and brain implant that increases his physical strength and hopefully will allow him to download a station reboot program from the top programmer.  Don't ask.

The program is meant for the evil secretary of defense, Delacourt (Jodie Foster).  Much has been made of Foster's accent which appears to be part French and part South African, but who cares.  Its 141 years in the future.  In L. A. they're speaking a combination of Spanish and English.  Let's move on.  Getting in Max's way is a henchman of Delacourt played by Blomkamp's buddy and the star of ""District 9"", Sharlto Copley.

While ""Elysium"" falls short of ""District 9,"" the flaws are not fatal.  Still, it would be interesting to know if all the other major cities/countries are like L. A. I also wondered how the world got to where they are today.  The film is beautifully shot with some chuckle-worthy product placements.  The wealthy program writer (William Fichtner) is transported between worlds in his black and red Bugatti space buggy.  Secretary Delacourt sports a nifty Bvlgary watch.  If anything Blomkamp is even more in-your-face with his politics.  While ""District 9"" was certainly an unveiled parable of apartheid, ""Elysium"" takes a broader stab at privilege with health care concerns a critical plot element.  ""Elysium"" is a good looking movie that moves right along with some cool action sequences.",1376092800,5,2839,4.783950617283951
5914906,1,B00EHK2S04,"I just saw Elysium on its opening day. I left the theater knowing I will never see it again. Over 140 years in the future, those on Elysium, a huge orbiting space station with an artificial earth environment, live pampered lives with access to medical care that can cure any illness and nearly any injury. Those on earth live in a polluted environment, work meaningless low paying jobs with zero access to Elysium's state-of-the-art medical care. (Not much changes in the future - that's the underlying message of the movie!) The goal of all is to buy a counterfeit citizenship for Elysium and be illegally smuggled to said space station.

While Matt Damon did a credible job as the ex-con Max who must get to Elysium to cure his radiation poisoning (caused by an unfeeling corporation, nothing changes there either), the movie overall was not worth the price of the ticket. The plot is contrived and makes little sense, the action/fight scenes are impossible to follow given the rapid camera movement and angle changes, and the audience is never given an opportunity to invest in or much care for any one character. The last fifteen minutes forces you to suspend your common sense. The code for a computer program that will reboot the entire computer system of Elysium is locked in Max's head and must be uploaded to Elysium's mainframe computer or all is lost.  It simply defies all logic that Max's supporters manage to illegally land their ship with zero opposition - all other illegal ships tended to be destroyed by the stations defense forces (called Homeland Security no less) - and then encounter little in way of security (human or android) before reaching the undefended, unpassword protected, and easy to use computer console that controls everything. Furthermore, the computer code stored in Max's brain was completely unencrypted, required no password to view or install, and, finally, resulted in irrevocable changes to the computers running Elysium's defense and support functions (or at least the joyful ending would have us believe).  One always has to suspend a certain level of belief for a scifi movie, but Elysium asks us to check our brains at the door of the theater.

If you like action without letup, computer generated backgrounds galore, an excess of profanity, and illogical plots then this movie is for you.  I went to see it because I was impressed with ""District 9"" and generally like any Matt Damon movie. However, do not waste your money at the theater.  I recommend waiting to see it some cheaper way, if see it you must and hopefully I didn't reveal too many spoilers.

1. The place at the ends of the earth to which certain favored heroes were conveyed by the gods after death.
2. A place or state of perfect happiness.

If you enjoy the following you will probably LOVE Elysium:
Sci-fi, District 9, Mad Max, action, anarchy, conspiracies, futuristic weapons and robots.

At first my main attraction to Elysium was that it was from the makers of District 9. I wanted it to be just as good. And oh, it was! Visually Elysium is similar, but the story is unique and fresh. All the characters were well played. Matt Damon rocked it, and if you need help convincing your girlfriend to watch this movie tell her Matt looks smoking hot. But seriously, the story line is excellent. It gets you thinking, and sticks with you.

Despite the worthwhile message, I won't be letting my son watch this one until he is MUCH older. I would not advise this movie for those sensitive to violence. Be prepared to see some bodies literally blown to pieces.",1376092800,6,985,4.617142857142857
