8695136,1,B00RDZMX96,"This review is for the blu ray disc and not the film! This blu ray is atrocious, the video is terrible, the OAR is cropped from what should be 2.35 and we are given a 1.85 image. No subtitles!! There are scenes in Spanish that cannot be translated!! I enjoy this film but this disc has taken that away. Stay away!!! Thought this re-release would be improved by Lionsgate but it has not!",1425772800,4,386,4.301369863013699
