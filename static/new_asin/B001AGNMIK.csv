3447590,5,B001AGNMIK,Whenever we're in the mood for a good scare we pull out The Ring. The kids always end up sleeping with a light on afterwards.,1367452800,,125,4.04
3447591,5,B001AGNMIK,"This movie doesn't try to be one of those horror movies where they try to be as gory as possible. It is a great movie that will chill you to the bones. If you have never seen this movie and are a horror fan, you need to buy this now.",1367366400,,233,3.68
3447592,4,B001AGNMIK,"I just reviewed ""The Ring 2,"" so I figured that I should review the first in the series, even though it's been awhile since I've seen it.  I have watched it at least twice though, so most of the scenes are still in my mind.

But what I remember most is one of the themes of the film.  It's more of a question really than a theme, but that question would be:  ""Would you be willing to throw someone else under the bus to keep yourself from being run over?""  You probably know about the videotape in this film, and how watching that videotape will. . . . O.K.  I don't want to give out a spoiler.  Let's just say that you might want to throw out -- or donate, minus one particular tape -- that old videotape collection.  After all, there's DVD nowadays.  Better yet, how about Blu-ray?  1080P is always nice.  Perhaps better still, maybe HD streaming on a Roku box.  The new 4K technology best still, if it ever costs less than a brand new car.

This is one of the issues of this film, really, in the sense that it has already become somewhat dated even though it released about 10 years ago.  Who watches VHS anymore?  No one that I know, and I don't even believe that studios release films nowadays on VHS tape.  But from what I understand, there is a ""Ring 3"" in the works, which might be problematic since, in my review for ""Ring 2,"" I said that they went to the well one too many times.  Bad joke perhaps, but hopefully the next film, if there is one, will be as good as the first.

But I do believe that this is a top-notch horror movie.  It has all the elements that you're looking for:  sympathetic characters, intrigue, scares, etc.  And for me, I guess that it was filmed in the Seattle area, even parts of Monroe, WA, a town that I lived in for about 13 years.  (I believe that the house in one of the opening scenes was a house in Monroe that was up for sale, but I'm not positive.)  So I will admit that this film was more interesting for me than it might be for you due to the area in which it was filmed.

A pretty big recommendation by me if you want a good fright.  Maybe watch ""The Ring 2"" after that, but if you do, watch them in order as I believe the second film requires you to see the first one first.  I don't think that 2 is as disappointing as most of the reviews, so it's worth a peek.",1364947200,,2310,4.100446428571429
3447593,5,B001AGNMIK,"Though I like the Japanese version better as I tend to of these remake movies, the end of this was just classic and chilling.

3447598,1,B001AGNMIK,"I purchased this by mistake, not realizing it was the Horror genre. The story centers around a video, anyone who sees it is doomed to die shortly.

What a fine actress like Naomi Watts is doing in this movie is a mystery.  But, even her presence cannot save this silly story.",1232236800,2,275,4.372549019607843
3447599,4,B001AGNMIK,"Every horror buff knows -- the horror that creeps up on you gradually is much, much scarier the one who bounces out and yells ""boo"" as it decapitates somebody with a machete.

And sadly, most current ""horror"" movies lack horror, because it's easier to substitute it with screaming blondes, blood, guts and sharp objects. But ""The Ring"" is soaked in foreboding, creepiness and horrific imagery. Director Gore Verbinski relies heavily on the original Japanese movie for a lot of his remake's flavor, and the result is a slow-building terror that keeps twisting right up to the end.

Single mum Rachel (Naomi Watts) is attending her niece's funeral, after she died under bizarre circumstances. Several of her friends died on the exact same day, at the same time, which (surprise surprise) makes Rachel think this isn't a coincidence. So she investigates the mountain cabin all the kids stayed at a week ago, and finds an unlabeled videotape with a series of bizarre images -- and a curse that will kill you one week afterwards.

She enlists the help of her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) to help her unravel and break the curse. The secret of the tape is wrapped up in a young girl, Samara, who vanished from her adoptive parents' horse farm years ago. Somehow Samara's evil rage has lived in on her curse, and it will destroy Rachel, Noah and their son unless Rachel can find a way to escape it.

Remaking Asian horror movies is one of those movie trends that is hanging on in Hollywood, with everything from ""The Grudge"" to ""The Eye"" to ""Bangkok Dangerous"" getting the A-list Hollywood treatment. Some are good, some are mediocre, most are wretched. But ""The Ring"" was the first of these, adapted from Hideo Nakata's adaptation of Koji Suzuki's novel (cue cries of ""but the original was better). And it achieves the distinction of being almost as atmospheric and haunting as the original.

Most of its brilliance comes from director Gore Verbinski, who thankfully did not simply use the name and concept, and invent a teenybopper plot around that. This is actually rather similar to Nakata's adaptation -- Verbinski alters some few things from the original film, but keeps the same dark, murky atmosphere and many of the same scenes. Even the cinematography has a dark, overcast look, filled with forbidding symbolism -- lots of grey skies and overflowing water. It's as if Samara's influence is permeating everything.

And what about the horror? It comes from the building tension as Rachel's deadline creeps toward us, and brief flashes of Samara's influence -- for example, that poor horse going berserk on a ferry, or the blurred-out faces of the doomed. The entire movie is infused with the feeling that something invisible and ghastly is just waiting to attack you, and it's just waiting for the right moment.

The keystone of this movie is Naomi Watts. This talented actress is virtually perfect as the perpetually worried, perplexed Rachel; as the deadline approaches, her fear and grief are almost palpably overwhelming. Henderson is also good, whether as a flip carefree artist or as a caring ex-boyfriend. Dorfman is the one disappointment -- he seems less like a little boy than a pompous oracle, and he's almost creepier than Samara.

Which is saying something, because Daveigh Chase is utterly chilling as Samara Morgan, a creepy little devil-child with black weedy hair over her face, a white nightgown and ""Omen"" eyes. In keeping with the watery theme of the movie, she always seems vaguely damp.

""The Ring"" is one of those rarest kinds of movies -- a remake with its own flavour, even as it sticks to the original story. Excellent direction, great acting, and the haunting determination to never, ever watch an unlabeled movie again.",1212537600,28,3756,4.939778129952456
3447600,3,B001AGNMIK,"A Quality Production, with a Decent Cast, but a Poor Progression of the Plot.
There are other movies out there that assign super-powers to people who have been victims of horrible deeds.

This film asserts that the victim had some sort of variety of power prior to their tragedy.
There are some twists that help the movie to peak, every so often, but the power scaling becomes so unmanageable that, at some point, its easy to lose interest.

For one, injustice is not a good enough reason to give anybody the power to take life from multiple strangers.
That's what we call a plot-hole, and it's a pretty big one.

When you think about it, this is basically one of those movies that is saying ""What If"" this unstoppable force existed, and we showed everybody failing to deal with it.
Ooh! Scary Stuff!

Not Really.
""What if"" there was a Mustard Bottle in a Diner, and anyone who opened the lid, was doomed to only crave mustard for the rest of their lives.

OHHHH THE HORROR!
(LoL)

So, what if a girl with Evil Psycho-Kinetic Powers was pushed down a well by her parents, but not even death could stop her!
Okay, well then what's the point of making a movie about it, if she can't be stopped?

It's an interesting Twilight Zone episode, I'll give you that, but you can't base an entire movie around people failing to unstoppable forces.
That's just Boring, and it's also not based on a Universe where Justice exists, if you can't do anything to counter the malevolent force.

When it comes to that, it's almost like Rape.
Seriously, if you present your viewer with an Evil force that they can't get away from, doesn't that feel like Rape?

You can't base your plot in a Logical Universe, and decide to break the rules whenever you like, just because you think it'll be fun to constantly lead on your audience.
That's Lame.

Anyways, all the QQ aside, it's an entertaining movie, but the ending, as with many movies unfortunately, is also very poor, and disappointing.
Now, I'm going to watch the second Ring movie, so I gotta go! (LoL)

P.S.
A person could last A LOT longer than 7-days in a well.",1513900800,,2097,4.521164021164021

3447602,5,B001AGNMIK,"My mother has been a huge horror aficionado forever, and she tried to get myself and my brother into her genre of choice. Nothing seemed to stick... it wasn't that anything she tried was too scary, they just didn't interest me. She was watching The Ring soon after it came out on DVD, and I wasn't interested until the cursed video tape came onto the screen. It was just so... weird. And I became enraptured. I watched the rest of the film and then re-watched it the next night to catch what I'd missed, and thus gave birth to my love of the genre.

I have since seen the Japanese original (Ring/Ringu) and honestly between the two I couldn't choose which is better; they both are good for different reasons. And although I have seen technically *better* horror movies since, this one will always have a special place in my heart because of what it did for me.",1513209600,,860,4.443037974683544

Probably the most cogent plot of any horror movie ever (unless your IQ is less than your shoe size). The Ring: Take a clever horror movie trope; add one of the best crime thrillers ever made; add some genuine horror scenes; add a 'no escape' ending. Excellent! Also, we have the most successful horror device ever in addition ""the creepy kid"". Now, the crime thriller. This is absolutely amazingly well done & is what takes this movie outside of mere horror. There is sadness, elation, dashed hope, decent into madness, murder, coverup, denial & most surprisingly, pathos. The director takes you through this familiar but brilliant territory, gives you the satisfactory ending... and then flips it on you. All of this is deep but utterly coherent & easy to follow.

3447636,4,B001AGNMIK,"A reasonably intelligent addition to the horror genre.  A journalist (Naomi Watts) finds out about some mysterious videotape that, when watched, will somehow bring about one's death within seven days.  She manages to get her hands on a copy and watches it and inadvertently leaves it around for her son.  This intensifies her efforts to find what the video is really trying to say.  Bright and passionate, Watts follows every lead and uses every resource at her disposal and ultimately finds her answer.
The film, though relatively long by horror standards, maintains a steady pace as Watts shows a certain relentlessness even more desperate than most horror clichs.  The acting is strong and believable and scenes seldom drag on longer than they need.
My problem is the number of loose strings left here.  1) how is the entity behind these deaths benefiting by targeting random people; 2) the father says his wife should not have had a child - was this birth supernatural?; 3) why would the father off himself now rather than sooner or later?; 4) why did Watts' character not die?  It's pretty clear the entity is evil; 5) what's the point of fighting against an unassuageable, irate, omnipotent demon?

3447666,5,B001AGNMIK,"If you want to see a really creepy scary movie Japanese horror films are the way to go. This is basically in the same boat without being foreign. a videotape that if you watch it you die in seven days. The suspense builds up as the movie goes unlike a lot of horror films out there. This movie doesn't need a bunch of twists or pop ups or blood and gore to leave you a bit creeped out. It shows you the video tape that kills you in seven days also which can make you feel creeped out in real life but the phone call never happens. Movies about killer video tapes don't always show you the tape or all of it. That aspect adds to the fear the movie puts you in at the end. If you watched Scary Movie 3 then odds are you won't be scared but watching the movie when it was new definitely creeped me out even though I was pretty young, I still was able to grasp the concept of scary movies without just seeing a scary image on the screen. At the time I was scarred by the movies Dreamcatcher and Tremors. The Ring never left me scared for more than a week but I never forgot the film and every time the TV went static or blacked out Id think of The Ring, even now. The Ring was a great horror movie in its time I miss the feeling I got when me and my brother watched the killer video tape, trying to cover our ears and eyes each time. It will always be a great movie to watch whether you've seen it before or not and better when you haven't seen Scary Movie 3.",1481846400,,1455,3.969283276450512

3447677,5,B001AGNMIK,"Great dark, atmospheric, suspenseful horror movie.
I watched it because, it's almost Halloween, and this movie does not fall short.
It definitely suits the month of October, and I would highly recommend this be your scary movie to watch with popcorn just a few days before Halloween (in the dark).
This movie was actually a surprise, considering that horror movies usually bore me, given all the building up the deadly outcome, but this movie didn't bore me one bit.
The suspense building that took place for almost the entire movie worked.
The suspense and the dim atmosphere kept me intrigued, well, as the movie went on ""intrigued"" would be kind of an understatement.
I was wound up in the story line. It was not predictable at all, even though i saw a few clips before I watched the movie, they somehow completely managed to slip my mind.
Most of the things I saw in the trailers don't happen until later in the movie, and although I waited for these things to take place to scare the hell out of me, I didn't grow impatient.
Overall, this is a really good horror movie.
Not the scariest you'll watch.
But the dark atmosphere, the suspense, the unpredicatableness (not a word), that came with the movie, makes it one overall enjoyable, scary, suspenseful, mind-f-ing movie. I recommend this as you're next scary movie.",1477180800,,1322,4.752173913043478

Impressively done, and I am very put off by 99% of horror films; they never work

This one did

Best viewed when you are feeling vulnerable; perhaps your significant other is leaving you; perhaps you fear you will lose your job.

Wait for that, then watch. It scared the holy living bejesus out of me, despite being a grown man 10 years ago. Night-time in winter added to the effect, maybe some fog around to match. The mood of the film ensnared me, made the dated technology irrelevant.

Best part?
The part where the girl takes it to the next level
Right about 1:40:30 ++
Crapped my pants

The gradual buildup of tension and judicious withholding on the part of Verbinski was brilliant; it has a potentially lasting effect on the viewer.

3447693,5,B001AGNMIK,"The whole idea of viewing a video cassette which brings out the wrath of a demonically possessed ghost child that wastes no time in killing the unsuspecting viewer is silly. I suppose the idea of the ancient technology of a video cassette showing some kind of hypnotic ring that releases an evil curse is not totally outside the realm of horror filmdom, but the film really fails in helping the viewer understand where the curse comes from and why the little girl's ghost has such a blood lust.

But ultimately, this is all irrelevant in how this film is experienced by the viewer. The genius of this film lies in its style, and how the director, Gore Verbinski, brilliantly creates a haunting mood of fearful foreboding, rarely seen in most horror films. There is a wonderful sense of Americana gothic to this film, and the sound effects are absolutely awesome in contributing to the eeriness of this film. Finally, how can one ever forget the horrific sight of the little girl, her face totally covered by her long stringy hair and wearing a kind of gothic pajama, as she slowly approaches her victim. The film is brilliant in its presentation of style and mood, so much so that the story is secondary in making it such a great horror film.

Naomi Watts is terrific in this film. Frankly, I don't think she has ever been more beautiful in a film, and her strong performance in this film carries the charisma of a true leading lady. This film won me over as a fan of her work.

I never viewed the original Japanese version, though from what I understand, it too was a fantastic film which The Ring owes heavily to. Nevertheless, I like the way The Ring presents itself in an American context, emphasing the gothic aspects of American history and locales.

One of the best horror films ever made. You won't forget it after viewing it.",1474243200,,1834,4.599388379204893

***Spoiler Alert***

The movie starts off with two teenage girls having a sleepover. Katie tells Becca that she watched a video tape with her boyfriend and once the footage is over, the phone rings and a girl's voice says ""7 days"". Becca thinks that Katie is trying to scare her.

Later that night, Katie goes downstairs and she sees the TV turn on by itself. Petrified, she calls out to Becca but Becca ignores her. She runs upstairs and sees water flowing out from under the bedroom door. The TV switches on and there is an image of a well. A girl emerges out the the well and Katie is found dead with a petrified, disfigured look (like she was screaming).

The story shifts to Katie's funeral and we meet her aunt Rachel and Rachel's son Aidan. Aidan tells Rachel that Katie told him that she only had a week to live. Rachel finds out that the three friends who were on holiday with Katie, also died at 22h00 the same night. Rachel finds the photos from their holiday and she decides to go to the cabin to investigate. She snatches the unmarked videotape and watches it. She gets a call thereafter and a girl says ""7 days"".

Rachel shows the tape to her ex-boyfriend, Noah (also the father of Aidan) and he dies the same way that Katie did. Aidan watches the footage and Rachel is against time to try and save herself and her son from the same horrific death. Will she succeed???

3447795,4,B001AGNMIK,"Probably my favorite horror movie, though I'm not a huge fan of the genre. Avoids some of the worst horror tropes. Has a great atmosphere and a good plot compared to other horror movies. It's good at convincing you that you should be scared, instead of throwing horrible things at you and going, be afraid now!

The main character is pretty composed and competent for a woman in a horror movie, probably because the original version of this story was about a man. I wouldn't go as far as to call the movie feminist, but for once, there is no torture-porn aspect and she's not just female as a shorthand for helplessness.

Having seen and even read the Japanese originals, I can tell you to skip them. The books are awful and offensive. The movie Ringu (a middle step between the books and this movie) is okay, but everything good about it was refined into The Ring. I say all this as someone who usually prefers originals to American remakes. Point is, if you are curious about this story for any reason, The Ring is the best version of it. The others won't give you any context or deeper appreciation. They'll just give you spoilers.",1434931200,3,1134,4.5268292682926825

I like the fact that it didn't deviate all that much from the original Japanese version and try to turn it into some teen horror flick.

The Ring was a fun (for me at least) movie to watch because all the scary stuff wasn't right in your face, you kinda got to move along with the characters trying to figure out what the hell was going on while still seeing glimpses of what might be happening or what did happen.",1427328000,,728,4.170212765957447

actors to compensate for some of its major failures. This is only why I'll give it 2 stars.

There's actually a very interesting lore and backstory to this movie that's really executed well in other movies. It gives you just enough clues to keep you wanting more information. The (ring) video is appropriately creepy and when it's revealed as to what the video was actually a bit, it all makes sense in a disturbing and sad way.

3447884,4,B001AGNMIK,"I have yet to see the Japanese version of the Ring, so obviously, unlike other websites, I cannot comment onto whether or not the American version is superior or inferior. What I can say is that this was one hell of a movie, and in a way I'm pleased to be able to review it on it's own merit without the influences of another flick in my mind.

 I went into it with mixed emotions. All have heard the hype of how terrifying or disturbing it is. Since I very very rarely become frightened by the cinema, I tried to rely more on the plot for my expectations. The story itself sounded...weak. A video tape that kills you after seven days??? I didn't see how it could be pulled off.

 Thankfully I didn't go in expecting the best from all the hype, but in a way the worst, and I turned out very suprised in a positive way.

 First of all - the story. Wow. Creative as hell, a real mind-twister - Gotta love mysteries. You just had to watch to the end once the movie itself pulled you in - much like what Samara does to her victims. ;) We begin with two teenage girls in a slightly modern, cliche manner and then are cut off to an episode that is supposed to be construed as frightening (for them, not me). We then jump to the character of Rachel, played by the very talented and appealing Naomi Watts, a reported and mother who was an aunt to one of the girls.

 Her son was negatively affected by his cousins' death and is in many ways more than a simple little boy. He plays the part well - solemn, slightly off the rocker, and perhaps a little psychic. Rachel soon decides the death of her niece is worth a thorough investigation and ventures out into the rest of the tale with a mixture of optismism, skepticism and personal horrors all her own. Her sidekick ex-husband Martin, played by Noah Keller, is very likeable and makes his scenes enjoyable.

 Truly some surprises along the way, not predictable at all - an intelligent film that doesn't need gore and excess violence to accomplish what it sets out to do.

 Samara herself is one creepy chick. Throughout the movie you don't really know what to think of her.

 The end has a shock of its own in store for viewers. Whatever can be said for this plot, it is not stale and leads horror into a more intelligent direction (the oposite of what the simple reading of the plot would suggest).",1379635200,10,2342,4.3173515981735155

3447891,5,B001AGNMIK,"When this movie came out I really didn't put much stock into it, the Blair Witch was a disaster and I was really NOT looking for anything more than maybe mediocre, at Best,- I've always loved Horror . I dont' think I've seen a decent Horror film in years, the Genre got all convoluted and laughable. This one however reminded me of the Shining - all Goosebumps ( which is what Horror should be), leaving you guessing at just what the heck is going on.
It never got the recognition it deserved as far as I am concerned,and No- it didn't have big actors, writers or directors that I know of (Not when it came out , at least).
But trust me - it's a Gem. What's more is it looks like they didn't spend a ton of money on a top notch film.( Which just proves you don't need a ton of money to make a decent film!)
Hat's off to everyone involved in the making of the Ring.
By the way , I saw the original ringu, too - and all I can say is :
I am glad someone saw the potential this movie really had and made it into something memorable!
Thank you!",1372896000,,1039,4.024154589371981
