2601903,5,B000G74RYC,"This DVD gives so much of information about 30D and general photography, it's very good. I recommend it to anyone",1168128000,,113,4.7
2601904,5,B000G74RYC,"This DVD is more than I expected. After many years as an amateur 35mm film photographer, I came to DSLR with a decent amount of basic knowledge. I thought I would view this DVD one or two times, tops, then sell it. Instead, I will keep it as a reference.

This DVD is full of clear explanations and video on many of the camera's functions, along with a few tips on becoming a better photographer. I dare say it covers all of the camera's basic functions, and also some of the more advanced features.

The DVD admits it leaves out some information (eg some, but not all custom functions are explained), but frankly, I am not bothered by this. This camera is a computer, and has far more capability than most of us will ever use. The DVD gives you more than enough information to get started and the camera manual can later fill in on the more advanced features, if and when you need them.

The DVD is divided into chapters so you can review a topic without searching, or you can watch the entire DVD as if it were one, long movie. I warn you though, there is so much information in the DVD, you will need to watch it multiple times to pick up all the pointers and instructions.

This DVD is certainly worth its price. Especially for those of us who tend to nod off while trying to plow through a camera manual.",1165708800,15,1309,4.287449392712551
2601905,4,B000G74RYC,"I have watched this DVD several times.  I am new to DLSR photography.  Throughout my consumer life, I have usually been disappointed with books or DVD's promising it is for beginners and then they get far too difficult, due to the authors being too technical and expecting the viewers to understand some of the terminology or techniques which are not at the rookie level.  This DVD is excellent and is a must have for beginners.  They walk you through the camera, make it simplistic yet interesting and informative.  My only advice would be they walk through a little better and actually show in the demonstration someone pushing the actual buttons during the walkthru, instead of explaining which button to use.  I learn better by watching, than listening.  Overall, I have learned my money's worth though and rate this DVD highly.  I am going to order the same DVD by the same company to better learn, at the rookie level, how to use my Speedlite 580EX.  Buy it if you are a rookie to DSLR's.  If you have a moderate level of understanding already, just read the manual, as this is a learning tool for beginners, and performs as promised.",1163548800,11,1140,4.683417085427136
2601906,5,B000G74RYC,I bought this DVD a few months ago and have watched it 5 times already. Great for a beginners and full of great information.,1162771200,4,124,4.208333333333333
2601907,4,B000G74RYC,"I purchased the 30D when it first came out. I was fine with it, but watching this DVD explained a few things and showed me a few things that I wouldn't have used on the camera, like the custom functions. The custom function for the set button is great. I now have me set button programed to pull up the ""Picture Style"" menue when I press it. Well worth a look. Even if you just learn one thing it's worth it.",1162684800,8,408,4.049382716049383
2601908,5,B000G74RYC,"This is a very well put together introduction to a very powerful camera. The quality of the presentation is superb, with very high quality video and sound. However, this product is for beginners to digital SLR photography, not for intermediate or advanced users. But if you are new to this powerful type of a photographic equipment, this DVD gives an excellent introduction of all beginning and many advanced 30D features. The time it will save you is well worth the price of the DVD.",1155081600,25,484,4.773809523809524
8129234,5,B000G74RYC,Very good overview of the functions of the camera.  As opposed to reading the manual actually seeing the functions being performed is a great help.,1331856000,,147,4.88
8129235,5,B000G74RYC,"This is a powerful tool for all 30D owners!  I've watched this DVD and was just amazed at how easy it is to follow.  I plan on watching it over and over and taking notes.  When you have someone talking to you and showing you how to do something, it makes it easy to learn.  I highly recommend this DVD to all Canon 30D owners.",1234137600,,326,3.9692307692307693
8129236,4,B000G74RYC,I'M very happy with the introduction to the canon 30d video DVD. I will recommended to beginners and intermediate photographers.,1202428800,,128,5.45
8129237,5,B000G74RYC,"A very, very well produced video for an amature like me.  I am very pleased with this product!",1196812800,,94,4.222222222222222
8129238,5,B000G74RYC,This is a very good introductory DVD for using the Canon 30D. I learned quite a bit more from the video than from the manuals.,1191196800,,126,4.08
8129239,5,B000G74RYC,"I recently upgraded to a Canon 30D SLR - which was a major ungrade.  So, I have this lovely equipment and not too certain what to do.  I watched about an hour of this video and just LOVE the presentation.  It is for the novice; breaking down the terminology and gives an excellent overview of the camera and photography in general.  I love the presentation and the fact that you are encouraged to pause the video, try the technique just described and then come back and compare your shots against the demonstration.  The video is very reassuring that you may not understand everything right away, but in time and rewatching the DVD, you will get the sense.  I love it and highly recommend it.",1175212800,13,692,4.540322580645161
8129240,5,B000G74RYC,"I was very impressed with the DVD. A great companion to a newly purchased 30D, it gets you up and running really quickly.  The camera is already pretty intuitive, as Canon has a tendency to be, so you can move to more advanced features very swiftly.  I found I went back and watched sections again, which is very helpful if you don't take photos every day.

  The DVD is a great value compared to taking classes. The fact that it is very specific to your camera cuts through the learning time.",1173830400,5,493,4.373626373626373
8129241,1,B000G74RYC,This DVD offers no information that can't be found in your manual or on the web.  I was expecting a lot more.  Total disappointment.  Save your money...read your owner's manual.,1172016000,2,177,4.833333333333333
8129242,4,B000G74RYC,Good DVD that covered the basic features of the camera.,1171065600,,55,4.6
8129243,5,B000G74RYC,"I found the DVD very helpful in getting to know my way around the 30D.  I continue to review the video from time to time to learn more and more how to use the camera.

I'm moving from point and shoot to being able to take professional looking pictures.

The DVD helped me and I'm happy I got it.",1168819200,6,295,3.9661016949152543
