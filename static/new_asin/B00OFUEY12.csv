6735595,3,B00OFUEY12,"I loved the first Scorpion King movie.  The second and third were entertaining though not as much as the original.  This one was simply ok or as I like to put it, ""a one and done"" kind movie and that is it.  I won't be buying DVD for that reason.",1421193600,2,246,3.88
6735596,5,B00OFUEY12,This movie was a lot of fun.  Enjoy it for what it is.,1421107200,2,54,3.1538461538461537
6735597,1,B00OFUEY12,"Worst movie i have ever seen!!! I'm a big fan of the scorpion king movies, but this movie is junk!!!",1421107200,3,100,4.05
6735598,5,B00OFUEY12,"Fun, action packed & entertaining! Doesn't take it's self too seriously which works in it's favour! Suitible for older children & tweens. Has iconic actors in cameo roles and a very underrated, under publicized, main cast who do a great job of keeping the story and their characters alive and engaging!",1421107200,4,302,4.9411764705882355
6735599,2,B00OFUEY12,"With the right amount of power every man is dangerous. Mathayus (Webster) is on a quest to find a magical crystal with his partner and protege. When they find it Mathauys is shocked at the double cross and is left to escape on his own. He meets up with Valina (Hollman) and along with her father they team up to try and retrieve the crystal and stop his partner from obtaining an ancient power that is dangerous in the wrong hands. Before I start I have to give you my history with this series. I thought the first Mummy was OK but wasn't really a fan of the others. I was also not a big fan of any of the Scorpion King spinoffs but I did think that The Rock was a good choice to play him. The second and third one tried too hard to be like the original but with a limited budget and very limited acting ability they ended up just being boring and unexciting. With this movie they changed things up...a little too much. This movie felt like a cheesy version of the Hercules series with Kevin Sorbo...if you have seen that show then when I say this is cheesier than that one you may not believe me. After you watch the scene where Valina's father dresses like a chicken and tries to fly, or when Mathayus dresses like a woman to get into a temple you will believe me. Overall, just not good...at all. On the other hand it is a movie that you can watch and make fun of, for a while. I give it a D+.",1420934400,8,1396,4.117216117216117
6735600,3,B00OFUEY12,"The Akkadian Scorpion King Mathayus (Victor Webster) is back for part 4. This film is more akin to part 3 in that it is light and lends itself to camp and cliche instead of being a serious epic action film. Our warrior teams up with femme fatale Malina/ Sugarlove (Esm Bianco) and her eccentric inventor father (Barry Bostwick) in order to find the legendary lost palace of Alcameda (?)  while battling a rival king and his army, a dragon, and midgets. Feels like an Indian Jones film at times.

The film is anachronistic, borrows modern phrases, and even employs swagger music. In the beginning a guy not hiding his Brooklyn accent (Lou Ferrigno) says, ""No one steals from me.""  I am not sure how much of this type of thing was intentional or not. In any case it was funny and entertaining, but it wasn't sustained...like in Part 3.

This is a film with no swearing, sex, or nudity. Suitable for the tweens.",1420848000,9,908,4.552147239263804

6735628,3,B00OFUEY12,"Fun movie that the family enjoyed. I felt I had to step in as too many are rating the seller instead of the cast and movie. I purchased it because it was close to being as entertaining as the first movie. Not quite as good a cast or budget, but casted fairly well and a good use of the budget they had.",1458950400,,302,3.8870967741935485

6735631,1,B00OFUEY12,"To be honest there's not much to say... The acting is abysmal,the lines are abysmal, and everything about this movie is abysmal. It is complete and utter trash. I've seen childrens cartoons on Sprout with better plot and acting than this. It is the biggest waste of time and I would wish it on my worst enemy. Some might say it's so bad it's good,but no. It's so bad that it's created a new definition of bad. I'd rather watch my kids make a fantasy movie in our backyard. The original Scorpion King was cheesy but good for it's time,ever since then it's been a steady decline in quality. This the bottom of the barrel and I would recommend it yo anyone even for free.",1457222400,,668,4.352

6735639,5,B00OFUEY12,"Why the main star Victor Webster has received second billing to cameo performances by Lou Ferrigno  in this 4th Scorpion King installment & second billing to supporting actor's in his first portrayal of the Scorpion King in the 3rd franchise installment is a bit insulting!  His acting is as good as any actor to play the Scorpion king including ""The Rock"".  The Scorpion King grew from a poorly rendered C.G.I. effect in the Mummy franchise resurrected to fight the Mummy into a successful franchise of its own.  This 4th installment in the franchise has all the fun & adventure as its predecessors, not slowing in pace or suffering from a worn out story line.  These movies are not made with Oscars in mind they are geared towards fun escapist fantasy & in that this movie certainly delivers.  From the 1st movie to the 2cnd origins tale we see the adventure slash comic relief formula that makes these Sword & Sorcery action films so much fun continued in the 3rd & ""The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power"".  But I don't find fault in formulated movie's...hey its worked for James Bond for decades!  If your as big a fan of the Sword & Sorcery genre as I am I think you will be happy to add this to your collection.  I don't judge movies on their given budgets rather their ability to entertain on said budget & I feel that every one of the movies in the Scorpion King franchise doe's the job quite nicely.  So many films in the genre come from literature its kind of cool to see a new character created purely by Hollywood.  While there is violence in this movie the comic relief keeps it from getting to dark but not so comic that the movie feels campy, I've actually seen a lot bloodier westerns. While its nice to see cameo's by endearing actors like Lou Ferrigno  I still find it insulting that his billing is higher than the main character when his screen time is less than 5 minutes with roughly that many spoken words!!!  Its also nice to see that these movies promote good morality lessons for the most part.  Basically by todays standards this & the other films in the franchise are family friendly.  You see much more graphic violence on T.V. series these days as well as blatant sexual themes that are definitely not appropriate for children!  I am not a prude but animated shows on T.V. today are deliberately perverting morality for laughs & most parents aren't vetting animated T.V. because they grew up in a time that you didn't have to worry about that kind of subversion.  Well I guess I am getting off task, but if your not a armchair critic & like a little escapist fantasy on rainy days this movie will provide you with just that. I will say I saw a review stating the storyline was totally unbelievable, apparently this person wasn't aware of how tenaciously  Hitler sought out religious relics believing they would give him a edge in war, so the storyline is not so far fetched.  Other than that I enjoyed this persons review & their analogies to cartoon characters was spot on.",1445385600,3,3002,4.5464684014869885

Ellen Holman picks up where she left on in her sword-wielding days on Spartacus and looking pretty ripped, too. Although, I'm not sure why she used an English accent in this one.

The acting wasn't great by some support characters and the sets left a great deal to be desired. Victor Webster is fun as the scorpion King, Will Kemp was terrific as Drazin? Barry Bostwick was terrific as the befuddled scientist. We got a whole ton of guest appearances and some should have stayed in retirement. We have, rutger Hauer, Lou ferrigno, M.

6735657,1,B00OFUEY12,"Oh my, how this franchise has crashed and burned! What started out as an epic fantasy action saga has devolved into an overly-comic series featuring characters getting hit in the crotch and making funny faces, horrible jokes, way over-the-top acting, and barely anyone getting hit with a sword despite everyone owning a sword. What really makes this movie awful is the amount of wasted talent that could have saved it completely. Some actors who only get small cameos are Rutger Hauer, Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, and even Lou Ferrigno whose face is the biggest thing on the film's cover. For me the biggest sin was wasting Michael Biehn, the hero of such classics as Aliens and The Terminator. What were the filmmakers thinking? The biggest actor they keep around is Barry 'Brad Majors' Bostwick, but as much as I respect the guy, he had the most annoying role. Poor Victor Webster tries to act like a serious action star, but it doesn't work with all the goofy characters around him. The guy deserves better roles, he has the charisma to carry a movie. This franchise lost all dignity after the third one, and I'm sorry to say that it hasn't recovered. No more Scorpion King movies for me, I'm done.",1431043200,2,1198,4.70952380952381

6735698,2,B00OFUEY12,"I gave it 2 stars because it was so bad that it actually was funny to watch. The only thing missing from the Lou Ferrigno character was using Mike Tyson for his voiceover. I figure that the reason you only see 1 camel was because they couldn't budget 2 and the zoo needed it back by 5  o'clock. Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as some sort of King, hopes he uses his paycheck for a good facial peel, his wrinkles have wrinkles. Anyway I'll sign off for now because 15 minutes of this Netflix freebie was enough for me. But it is funnier than Home alone 4, if you catch my meaning. LOL",1421539200,5,585,4.176991150442478
6735699,2,B00OFUEY12,"Extreme Bias Alert! I really dislike action/comedies with very few exceptions. This movie has everything that I don't like from The Mummy and Scorpion King films and kept none of the parts which I enjoyed. I have The Scorpion King editions 1, 2, and 3 so I bought 4 to complete the set. I really enjoyed the first 2 films of this set and I even liked part 3 mostly but this is 100% Looney Tunes type comedy with real life people. You also need to know that this is not a continuation of part 3 in the least with no explanation of how he gets here in the story. The Kings right hand man is Elmer Fudd,  Scorpion King is the Road Runner, The King is Yosemite Sam, the most rootin tootin cowboy that never ever wins. I don't give spoiler alerts but I really am tempted to give you the details of just how bad this is. I will just say that the storyline is totally unbelievable and the dialogue and acting are pretty bad from top and continues to get worse the lower of importance the characters are. The only reason this doesn't get one star is because I do not use strong words such as Hate to describe movies in general.

The possible good things are, No Nudity, No vulgar Language, Cartoon Type Violence and some of the guys might want to see the one girl fight that some might find entertaining.",1421539200,5,1296,4.264227642276423

8683372,5,B00OFUEY12,"Mathayus is a warrior from the Akkadian Empire trained into the Order of the Black Scorpion. There are a few glaring historical mistakes during the series, such as the Akkadian Empire ended around 2300 BC yet the lands between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers is described as 'desert' but back then it was rich grasslands, a bread basket, the Cradle of Civilization; it wasn't until the end of the Bronze Age which was about 1200 BC that the area of modern day Iraq began to turn to desert. Also, throughout the series we see Roman Armor and Medieval castles. We also see sword designs which would never survive in battle and armor which is totally fantastic. But all that aside, the series is not half bad although it must be considered a B-Movie series including skimpy outfits and sometimes cheesy lines. They fight scenes are pretty good. There is no frontal nudity although there are some suggestive dialog and situations.

The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior is the origin-story of Mathayus, the protaganist of the series. His co-star is a tom boyish kick butt girl and there is also another hard fighting character that is a goddess of love and war featured in the story. Mathayus' father is murdered by Black Magic and Mathayus sets out to revenge his father's death, traveling to the Underworld to retrieve a magic sword to kill his nemesis.

The Scorpion King stars The Rock and is the only film he appears in. An evil king is trying to take over the world, and doing quite nicely as he is using a sorceress who can foresee the future to tell him when to attack. A unit of Scorpion Warriors are hired as mercs to stop the evil King.

The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption stars Victor Webster as Mathayus after he loses his Wife and Kingdom. In this movie Mathayus goes to India and fights a guy who summons three dead heroes to aide him in conquering all of India. Mathayus teams up with a The Cobra who is fighting a guerrilla war against the bad guy. Again there are two tough female fighters in this movie with great fight scenes between them.

The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power again stars Victor Webster as Mathayus. In this movie our hero teams up with a displaced Princess and her crazy tinkerer father to over throw a power mad King and reinstate the rightful line onto the throne of a European mountain kingdom. This one has the most laughs in it.",1525478400,,2377,4.546728971962617

8683379,2,B00OFUEY12,"Note: I didn't buy this on Amazon but watched it on the Sci-Fi Channel. My Lord. This is a terrible, terrible movie. The first Scorpion King had the classic Mummy formula: swords and sorcery, vague Egyptian mythology and history, adventure, and sexy chicks in pointlessly revealing outfits who can fight but generally need an similarly clad big strong man to save them. The only difference is that in here, the special effects, the sets, and the prop work are so badly, badly, badly done that you find yourself hoping you didn't spend money to see this movie. The acting is very overdone, particularly in Will Kemp's case, though Valina and Mathayus aren't too bad. You can tell by the switch to ""Norvania,"" a paper-thin name for a kingdom in the European North, that the filmmakers were running out of ideas. They were also running out of money. Look, the weapons in The Scorpion King 3 were badly made, but not so bad that I knew you could buy them off of Trueswords for thirty dollars bad. Drazen's weapon would never be carried by anyone but Skeletor, and yet a MAIN character uses it. Another thing to note is that most Mummy/Scorpion King movies generally try to compensate for the bad history and plot by stuffing in an ensemble cast. You can tell that these movies are bad by the list of celebrities that appear. All of them are B-list, even C-list talent and it shows. Their characters are generally all inconsequential to the plot, yet they all show up on the movie poster. And for some pointless reason, even the characters that were enemies or random acquaintances of the protagonists ALL show up at the end scene. Why would any of them merit an invitation? Jeez, this movie is only getting two starts instead of one because now that I've gone through its predecessors, I have given up on the possibility that they would even try to make this movie good. It's like Dragonball Evolution. You don't watch it because it's a good movie, you watch it because you know when life is going bad for you, it will never go as badly as the end result of this movie.",1499385600,,2065,4.583783783783784
