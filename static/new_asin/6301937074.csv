7817736,3,6301937074,"Claude Lorius is a glaciologist. Over a 60-year career he has participated in more than 20 polar expeditionsnot only to study glaciers and glacial movement, but also to drill deep down into their near-timeless cores to analyze the ice from different time periods. What they reveal is fascinating, and one of the films memorable moments comes when were taken into an archive of core-drill ice samples all stacked in rows on shelves according to samples dated by their air bubblessome of them going back 800,000 years. Lorius began his study of glaciers in 1956 as a 23-year-old man, but as early as 1965 his research was telling him something disturbing. Long before the polar caps began to melt, Lorius was predicting that they would because of the appearance of so-called greenhouse gasses in the ice samples he was taking, and the way those gasses altered the composition of the ice.

Theres no denying that the work Lorius does is fascinating science, unless you're a U.S. politician who denounces anything that gets in the way of the economy. But its not very compelling as drama. Antarctica: Ice and Sky, a film by Luc Jacquet that closed the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, is a treatise on global warming thats frankly dull in spots. The dialogue is overwritten and often stilted, and there aren't enough shots of Antarctica in HDwith far too much of the film relying on grainier archival footage from earlier expeditions. What Lorius and others do may be fascinating as scientific research, but so much of that research is repetitive and the progress so glacial itself that there isn't anything close to a dramatic structure to be found here.

I found myself liking the making of feature almost as much as the film itself. That one man would dedicate his life to the study of glaciers under such extreme conditions all but boggles the mindalmost as much as the idea director Jacquet had to tell the story of Loriuss research and dedication by taking him back to the place he loves. Thats right: taking a frail, 83-year-old man to the Antarctic again, where the temperatures are the coldest on earth. The lowest temperature recorded at Vostok Station, the base camp where a good deal of the film was shot, was -128.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The altitude alone12,800 feetis enough to tax younger men, let alone an octogenarian.

Seeing Lorius in the present-day talking about his work is inspirational. There is much to admire in the man, and what the vintage footage does and does well is to show details of life as scientists live it in extreme isolation while working under extreme conditions. Its a rare glimpse into everyday life that this film provides, and thats a big plus. Another plus is that the film has a social conscience. It pays proper tribute to a man who has dedicated himself to studying glaciers and sharing his results with a world that too often denies science when it gets in the way of business. This film is recommended for families with children who are interested in becoming scientists, and for those lawmakers who seem to think that they know more than someone whos spent 60 years doing meticulous and documented scientific research.

But Antarctica: Ice and Sky is not recommended for those who enjoy travel and place documentariesthough there are some amazing shots of night sky. Nor is it for those who enjoy nature films and hope to see plenty of the poles famed penguins. Though Jacquet also directed March of the Penguins, and though penguins do make a few appearances, Antarctica: Ice and Sky is mostly about the pursuit of science under the most horrible conditions imaginable. Its a film about a man and his work and others who share his passion and his commitment to research. As such, its worth watching, but the man himself is more compelling than this film. If you are concerned about climate change, Antarctica: Ice and Sky does a good job of explaining and illustrating how scientists are able to draw their conclusions. And if you arent? Then you might as well rent Frozen. In the future, animation might be the only way youll see a landscape like this.",1484956800,4,4095,4.8125
