If you haven't seen the series, much of what transpires in this movie will make no sense as you need to have all the character backgrounds to understand the plot lines. So as a stand-alone film, this will not work. This film is about 80 minutes which while longer than the episodes from the last season of Behzat C, many episodes from the first two seasons were around this length so it feels like a typical episode in some aspects.

In the plot Behzat, now retired from the Ankara homicide division and training children to play soccer, is pulled back into work by a strange case of assassination and multiple murders. Behzat's underworld nemesis Ecrument Cozer reappears as well to bedevil Behzat as well as the rest of the shady intersection of crime and politics that was a continuing theme in the series.

The film is well photographed, better than the program for the most part but that doesn't help with other aspects of this film. The actors all have a lower energy than the series where they were constantly getting into arguments. In fact, the entire film is not as well paced as the series usually was. Perhaps the producers realized that they didn't have enough material and instructed everyone to slow down. The music is also less interesting. Unfortunately a number of regular characters you got to know during the series do not appear in this film. So Behzats excitable brother Sevket, Behzats daughter Sule, Cevdet and Asli along with Haruns family all are not seen in this story. While characters wouldnt be in every episode, after the intense finale of the series, one would have liked to see them or at least get an acknowledgement that they existed. There are some indications that the producers intended to continue making Behzat C. which would explain the incompleteness that I feel here.

Another aspect that might make it tough for viewers is that this film is more grounded in Turkish politics than most of the series and that was already very grounded in Turkish politics. The filmmakers had some thoughts about Turkey's plunge into fascism they wanted to air and put them into this film. Seeing how Turkey went the way the film makers were warning about makes the film bitter to watch now. All in all the last episode of the series itself is a better ending to the Behzat saga than this movie.",1520985600,,2476,4.700460829493087
8640817,3,B00IC2O6A8,"In this second film inspired by the successful television series of the same name, our eponymous hero (Erdal Besikcioglu) becomes embroiled in a complicated plot involving arms-dealers, an assassinated government minister, a member of the German Embassy in Ankara who is not quite what she seems, a trip to Northern Cyprus, and an outbreak of serious rioting in Turkey's capital.  The plot is enormously complicated, involving high-level corruption in government as well as a potential outbreak of terrorism.  However the film's main interest - as in the television series - focuses on the central characters' relationships.  Behzat remains as miserable as ever, especially when the father of one of the boys in the football team he coaches is murdered.  His sidekick Harun (Fatih Artman) provides comic relief, as well as acting the heavy whenever necessary.  Vulture (Berkan Sal) tries and fails to ignite a love-affair, but manages to persuade a news-anchor to tell the truth about what is happening on television, in defiance of the television bosses' wishes.  Meanwhile Ghost (Inanc Konukcu) enjoys a brief respite in narcotics rather than homicide.  Behzat's old adversary Ercument (Nejat Isler) reappears; the conflicts - as well as the climatic scrap - between the two men are some of the film's principal highlights.  BEHZAT C: ANKARA YANIYOR is at heart a routine crime thriller, but can be appreciated by anyone familiar with the now-defunct television series.",1397433600,,1471,5.310344827586207
