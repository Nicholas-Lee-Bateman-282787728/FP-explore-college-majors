7965655,5,B000069HPA,"I LOVE the Thumb movies...and have all of them except Frankenthumb, Blairthumb.  The first one I saw was Thumbwars and I was hooked.  I'm a big Star Wars fan and this was a FUNNY SPOOF

It was FUNNY.  Princess Bunhead and Obi Wanu Scooby Doo...!

Thumbtanic was a lighthearted Leo and Kate break.  Even a Celine Dion video spoof was in it...My heart is a thumb...It was cute

THEY'RE ALL FUNNY!!!  I ALSO RECOMMEND Bat Thumb.  I want O Productions to do a Wonder Thumb movie and spoof Wonder Woman!",1155254400,,498,4.444444444444445

7965657,5,B000069HPA,"We rented Thumb Wars out of curiosity-on a whim. One of the kids noticed it at the video rental. We all loved it. Watched it over and over and over.  We then rented Bat Thumb. Also very funny. Thumbtanic was next.  The funniest so far.  I then discovered the 6 disk Thumb Set while browsing on Amazon.  I instantly bought it for the kids.  Sometimes I pull them out for friends when they visit.  Each Thumbmovie is very funny and short enough  when you need a quick fix of humour.  Ideal for multiple viewings.
Interestingly enough, Ive never met another person (aside from the people that Ive told) that have heard of any of theThumb Movies.  They're kind of like our little family secret.",1082678400,5,690,4.5
