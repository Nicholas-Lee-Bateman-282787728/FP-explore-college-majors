The pagan bits, the Christian beliefs, the evil, the good...and Michael Praed's Robin,--standing stalwart as everything fell to chaos around him.  Beautifully staged, craftfully acted, a precious diamond in the myriad of Robin Hood tales.",1300320000,,436,5.397058823529412

7815752,5,6301805208,"Please, please let this series be on DVD someday soon.  This series was the most exquisitely crafted work of art...it would be a tragedy if it were never to be released on DVD.  This series was magnificent...beautiful & talented actors, historically impressive, a VERY REAL, raw and inspirational experience.  The performances given by Michael Praed were so powerful...no one will ever be a better Robin Hood (not even Jason Connery in the later episodes!)  As another viewer mentioned, I also grew up watching this series.  It is in my top 5 all-time favorites!  My tapes are worn-out as well...I would also seriously buy every single episode if it were ever realeased on DVD, regardless of price.",1142726400,2,698,4.974137931034483
7815753,5,6301805208,"The BBC Roin Hood series, lasting  - as I recall - 2 seasons, was a masterpiece of fantasy and medieval storytelling, From the nicely authentic gear and sets and look of the characters, to the fine action, to the plot and character development, to the cool sorcery and Pagan remnants, this show is the best. I wish more of it was on tape, but just treat yourself, and get any of it that you can, whether the first season with the dark-haired Robin, or the second with the blonde - and get 'Herne's Son' to see how that happens...
