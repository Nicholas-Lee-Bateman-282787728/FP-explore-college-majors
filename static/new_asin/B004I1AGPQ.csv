8429874,2,B004I1AGPQ,Not that great for a younger player. I thought this would help my 11 yr old learn to play but this was mostly just an overview on the parts of the violin and nothing really on how to actually play.,1449446400,,197,3.95

8429876,4,B004I1AGPQ,"I bought this DVD for my girls to start on violin. It's actually better suited to a little older (12-adult) student, but good over all. It teaches all the basics from the parts of the violin on up. I think I may use it to brush up on MY violin skills!",1372636800,7,251,3.9411764705882355
