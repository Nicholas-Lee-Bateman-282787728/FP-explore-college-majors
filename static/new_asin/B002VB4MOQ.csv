8381812,2,B002VB4MOQ,"This video is low budget and far from educational.  The parts that could be informative are breezed through so quickly that its impossible to keep up.  The scant narrative is not very helpful either.  The people in the video are to my surprise nude, and 4 out of the 6 are not anyone I would like to see naked.

I won't be purchasing any other videos in this series.",1410998400,4,366,4.260869565217392
8381813,5,B002VB4MOQ,"MASSAGE IS MY CHOSEN PROFESSION.. so i own several massage DVDs.. this one is great for an experienced person or a couple who just want to break out of the ""old routine"" the instruction are easy to follow an the camera angles are perfect. It combines traditional THAI MASSAGE with a touch of sensuality...it has segments for the man to use & for the woman to use. Make sure you order the ""explicit"" version if happy endings are your thing. ENJOY!!",1367798400,8,447,4.530864197530864
8381814,5,B002VB4MOQ,"This is a very good DVD.  Mishabae has done a great job of using traditional Thai Massage as a basis for her own deeply satisfying approach to couples massage.  She marries the sacred healing aspects of this ancient art with the intimate bliss a couple can experience through loving touch.  The information and drawings of the Sen channels are very clear and the concept interesting.  This program walks you through Thai bodywork step-by-step and includes warm oil techniques and many sensual ""hugs and holds"".  Well worth the money.",1274832000,6,533,5.011363636363637
