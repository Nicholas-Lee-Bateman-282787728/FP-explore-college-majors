8193785,4,B000PXZSCC,"One thing I love about European flicks from the 70's is the flagrant political incorrectness that no one really cared about then - our collective skin was much thicker, which was a good thing (you may differ in your thoughts on this one, but we were stronger as a society then, and the world's only real superpower - coincidence?).
This is a great Edwige Fenech vehicle, and not a bad Italian sex comedy like some of her others from that period ('The Lady Medic', the Sexy Schoolteacher and Policewoman films). She's dressed provocatively or undressed throughout the film, so if you're a fan, it's a must. She gives a good performance and handles the comedy well, as she does in 'Cattivi Pensieri' and 'The Virgo, The Taurus And The Capricorn', both of which are worth a watch.
The political incorrectness comes from the fact that (SPOILER) after being sexually pursued by a father,  his eldest son and little brother whose family she married into, she beds down the 14 year-old boy, giving him his first encounter with a woman, but it's handled so sweetly and delicately that it almost seems right (I ain't sayin' it's right, I'm just sayin'). Today, you're looking at serious jail-time and a ruined life - watch it and you be the judge.
The only thing that hampers the film at all is the fact that it's dubbed in English, which is a pet peeve of mine - dubbed films all suffer from the fact that the folks doing the voiceovers aren't actors, so if it isn't a cartoon, it's guaranteed to be botched on one level or another, and some, if not all, of the actors are going to SEEM like cartoon characters. Other than that, it's a lightweight tale that has its share of moments, and fans of Fenech will all wish they were the 'Lover Boy'.",1283817600,,1735,4.543130990415335
8193786,5,B000PXZSCC,"How many movies are there named Lover Boy? Well fortunately for you this movie has neither Patrick Dempsey or Kevin Bacon it. It does have the lovely Edwige Fenech (From the Italian ""School Teacher"" films) who plays a sexy ex-wife of a family's deceased grandfather coming back to her husband's home for a visit. Once there, the trio of men left in this family are stunned by her beauty. And soon decide in order to catch her affections their going to be... ""Working for the Weekend!""(Sorry had to do it.) And of course plays of affection cause comedic situations as the only the italians do it, a great comedy for classic italian movie lovers, and people who like Edwige Fenech.",1219881600,7,679,4.666666666666667
