380349,4,630192875X,"My favorite film of all time is Stanley Kramer's 1963 comedy 'It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'.  The film has since been 'remade' twice.  Jerry Zucker of the famed trio 'Zucker-Abrams-Zucker' made 'Rat Race' which was loved by many when it came out in the late summer of 2001.  Then, there was this forgotten film from the writers of 'Revenge of the Nerds' and 'High Anxiety'.

Director Richard Fleischer (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea) directed this 1987 adaptation of the 'Mad World' story.  This film was first mentioned to me by my college roommate in 2004.  After searching videostore after videostore, I couldn't come up with any findings.  Even the ones that still carried VHS tapes dating back as far as 1984.

Luckily, through Ebay, I found an old VHS copy of 'Million Dollar Mystery' in mint condition that winter for under five dollars.  I received it after coming back from my winter vacation in 2005 and proceded to watch it.  Immediately from hearing the opening title sequence, I was propelled into 80s heaven.  I've been a mega 80s fan (movies, film, music) since about 1995 and the title song alone put a huge smile on my face.  The cast was also pure 80s personnas.  The only people I knew in it were Kevin Pollak, Eddie Deezen, Tom Bosley, Rick Overton, Rich Hall, Douglas Emerson, and H.B. Haggerty.

The one thing that was disappointing was the video's presentation.  While I know the bulk of VHS tapes in the 80s were all presented in full-frame, something told me that there was more to this film than the standard 1.33:1 ratio it was being presented in.  After watching it, I looked 'Million Dollar Mystery' up on The Internet Movie Database and to my amazement discovered that it was originally shot in scope widescreen 2.35:1, the same ratio used for 'Mad World' and 'Rat Race'!  For the longest time, I kept wishing that there'd be a laserdisc copy of the film that had been released in conjunction with the original VHS and that the film was presented in its widescreen format on it.

Sadly, I couldn't find any trace of an LD copy of 'Million Dollar Mystery'.  So, I did the next best thing, I wished and prayed for a DVD copy of the film to be released sometime before 2010.  Someone must've heard my prayers because sure enough, on Janurary 2, 2007 'Million Dollar Mystery' arrived on DVD complete with it's original scope widescreen presentation of 2.35:1, original theatrical trailer, and the original theatrical ending!  By that, I mean (after reading others memories of seeing the film in it's brief theatrical run and comparing it to the VHS and TV releases) that this ending involves one of the cops breaking the fourth wall and talking to the audience members into going and looking for the last million.

Of course, between the first time I watched my VHS copy and the time I purchased the DVD (which was actually today!), I read endless amounts of poor reviews for the film.  Apparently it came out during a time when big summer blockbusters were also coming out like Predator and Harry and the Hendersons (yes, even THAT did better than this film).  Also, the entire contest concept was lost on many theater goers.  Apparently, interactive cinema is not something that gets taken seriously unless it's a very notable director making the film (i.e. John Waters' 'Odorama' film, Polyester).

But regardless, I am happy to now own this film on DVD.  The newly presented widescreen version of the film has been cleaned up well, the theatrical trailer is presented in its entirety complete with the original contest text on-screen, and whether you liked 'Mad World' more than 'Rat Race' or vice-versa, I invite all of you to give this film a look.  Just to get a few chuckles, feel nostalgic (hey, I was just about to turn 4 when this film came out!), or to get an idea of what the concept of 'Mad World' would've been if made in the 80s.",1170028800,5,3873,4.680945347119645
380350,3,630192875X,"This film is something that did not get much of a chance I guess, 'cause I never heard of it. But these days all the video stores around here are selling there old VHS tapes to make room for the current day DVD's coming in all the time. So for a small price, i figured i'd see what old VHS titles they had that haven't come out on DVD and see what they are like.

I found this one called Money Mania (Australian Title) and found out through IMDB that it's US title is this one.

This movie is much along the lines of Mad, Mad, Mad world & Cannonball run, but reminds me more of Rat Race, which was made years afer this one. The humour is 50/50, some things really did not work, but some things where a chuckle. It's pretty tame humour and a bit slap stick at times, but it's a family movie, so what do you expect?

The plot is about a guy played by Tom Bosley (Mr. Cunnigham from Happy days) who is on the run from the goverment because he stole 4 million dollars. He pulls into a roadhouse diner and ends up having a heart attack in there and dieing. But before he dies he tells the customers in the place that he hid the 4 million in 4 different locations and leaves them with the clues. So the customers in the bar go on a race to find the money.

Along the way more people get involved, theres a newly wed couple who keep stopping all the time to make love (one of them is Eddie Deezen, the geek from Grease 2 and does alot of cartoon shows voices)there is the family, the parents and a snotty kid and they get involved with a couple of 1980's pro WWF wretlers, I dunno who the blonde was, but the other one I think was the Iron Sheik. There is the rebel and his chicks who get involved with 2 cops, one of the cops Kevin Pollak (you'll have seen him in something) who does some pretty good impersinations of Columbo, Cosby, Star Trek crew and a few more. plus theres more.

All along the way there trying to beat each other to the locations, every time a clue is solved they don't know to keep it to themself, they just blurt it out for everyone to hear and the race is on again.

What amazed me was the stunts pulled off in this movie. Apparently the stunt man on the film Dar Robinson was killed on this film doing one of the stunts. He apprently had just done Leathel Weapoen so it should give you the notion he was a damn good stunt man. Theres heaps of car stunts, even a bus skidding around, but what i was suprised to see was a plane landing in the middle of the road! In those days they didn't have CGI, and it doesnt look like the built a set! So only this movie and Cannonaball have i seen such a stunt!

This movies allright if you can find it. I'd love to see it on DVD and see some bonus features of how they did some of the stunts, but I doubht it's been a popular enough movie to have had footage kept. So nothing probably exsists from it. But i'd love to see how they did this stuff. I think the ending was wrong, it should have kept going, but they probably ran out of money and had to rap it up, give it a rent if you can find it.

7817044,2,630192875X,"But far, far, from the best.
Definitely preferred cannonball run and such.  Movie was full of bad acting, bad directing, and incredibly contrived scenes.  There were a few laughs, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1, but the whole movie was just overall a painful experience...  Find a better way to spend some money.",1269648000,,338,4.6

7817046,5,630192875X,I'm so happy this movie made it to DVD. I was searching for it for a while. It's just as hilarious as it was when I used to watch it on cable TV as a child. Anyone into old school comedies has gotta see this one.,1238716800,,212,3.630434782608696
7817047,2,630192875X,"I had the unfortunate challenge of continuously comparing Million Dollar Mystery too much with my classic; 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'. The plot is almost the same; a bunch of wanna-be rich people looking for money with disastrous and almost predictable consequences and in the end, (you guessed it right), none attaining the initial goal. The difference is that after looking at Million Dollar Mystery, I could not laugh as much as I should and was not excited by the script and acting either. Like some, it fails to take the 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' plot to the 'next'-higher level.",1234828800,,593,4.6571428571428575
