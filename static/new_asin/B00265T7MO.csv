8351981,4,B00265T7MO,"I enjoyed all 4 movies when I was a teen. Now I played it and it seems that my 4 children 15yr and 7yr old girls, 12yr and 11yr old boys also enjoyed them. Compared with all the new movies coming out, with all the technology available to the makers. I applaud Faerie Tale Theatre for what it had to work with. I loved all the Characters and Actors/Actresses. Love the Faerie Tale Theatre.",1312761600,3,388,4.256756756756757
8351982,4,B00265T7MO,"Collected here are four of the all-time great princess-themed episodes from Faerie Tale Theatre.

CINDERELLA:
Cinderella (Jennifer Beals) leads a life of drudgery and unhappiness at the hands of her wicked stepmother (Eve Arden) and her stepsisters Arlene and Bertha (Jane Alden and Edie McClurg). When the dashing Prince Henry (Matthew Broderick) invites all the eligible maidens in the kingdom to the Autumn Ball, Cinderella naturally wishes to go too. Too bad she's dressed in rags and doesn't have a coach. But she does have a Fairy Godmother (Jean Stapleton) who'll see that Cinderella's every dream comes true...

THE LITTLE MERMAID:
Pearl (Pam Dawber) is a beautiful young mermaid who lives with her father King Neptune (Brian Dennehy) and her sisters Coral and Anemonie (Donna McKechnie and Laraine Newman) in a kingdom at the bottom of the ocean. When Pearl comes of age and is allowed a brief glimpse of the world above the sea, she falls in love with a handsome Prince (Treat Williams) whom she saves from drowning when his ship has a fatal explosion.  Pearl makes a bargain with the Sea Witch (Karen Black): her voice in exchange for a pair of legs and hopefully the love of the Prince. Once on land Pearl quickly returns to the Prince, though he only has eyes for the lovely Princess Emilia (Helen Mirren)...

THE DANCING PRINCESSES:
Lesley Ann Warren and Sachi Parker star in an enchanting story about the daughters of a widowed King (Roy Dotrice) who somehow wear out their dance-slippers every night despite being locked in their room until morning. The secret is not discovered until a crafty soldier (Peter Weller) follows them and finds that they go dancing in a fairy-kingdom under the ground.

THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA:
Prince Richard (Tom Conti) leads a boring and eventless life under the thumb of his controlling mother Queen Veronica (Beatrice Straight). Until, one stormy night, in whirls the vivacious Princess Alecia (Liza Minnelli). But is she really a princess? Queen Veronica is skeptical, so employs a method to test her royalty: she places a tiny pea under 20 mattresses and quilts. If Alecia can feel the pea it will prove beyond any doubt her royal blood.  Will Alecia pass the test? And if she does, will she choose to marry Richard?

Perfect entertainment for the little princess in your family!",1244937600,6,2332,4.918575063613232
