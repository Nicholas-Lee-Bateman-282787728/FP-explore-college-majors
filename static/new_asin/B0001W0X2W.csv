2031178,5,B0001W0X2W,"This really needs to be re-released and out on DVD.  This is the quintisential concert film of the 80's New Wave and Punk scene in the U.S.  Great early Police and Go Go's footage.  The Gary Numan and Klaus Naomi pieces are absolutely incredible, and the best I've seen anywhere, if you can find it.",1091318400,5,299,4.4
2031179,5,B0001W0X2W,"I am surprised to see a vacuum of reviews on this great video. This is an outstanding event with a variety of bands playing in different cities in the US and England roughly at the same time, presented in a festival format. By the time this video was captured, punk had already matured a number of years and new-wave had long been on board, but the bands were still young.  The list of bands captures the spectrum of known bands from the early days through to its filming, including Dead Kennedies, X, Devo, Cramps, Klaus Nomi, Oingo Boingo, Orchestal Maneuvers, Surf Punks, Romeo Void, Gary Neuman, and a number of others. The variety of styles was fascinating at the time and remains so to this day as almost a documentary of the era. I recall flicking on the TV while on travel when it first came out, not knowing what I was in for, but immediately and thoroughly hooked from performance to performance.  Each gave their all, even the bizarre Nomi and the downright low-life Cramps.  A very satifying evening of music. Fascinating.  I do hope that there is a DVD on this one some day.",1081987200,19,1087,4.530612244897959
2031190,5,B0001W0X2W,"This movie turned up on INHD, a high definition channel owned by Mark Cuban.  It will play again on Wednesday, February 28.  Don't miss it, and TiVo it if you can.",1172102400,2,163,4.225806451612903
2031191,5,B0001W0X2W,"Has this title ever been put out on DVD? Fantastic 1981 two-hour film that showcases many up and coming new wave / punk bands in three-to-four minute performance snippets. Just SO many to check out, some for the first time, as I dug viewing clips by the Police, Wall Of Voodoo, XTC, Go-Go's, Klaus Nomi (the strangest act I've ever seen, and THAT'S saying something), Devo, Cramps, Gary Numan, Gang Of Four, X and simply too many more to list here. An absolute must-have.",1165449600,2,471,4.619047619047619
2031192,5,B0001W0X2W,"I had the privilege of viewing this film at a bar in Brooklyn less than a year ago and was floored!  Between The Police, Klaus Nomi, Toyah Wilcox, Oingo Boingo, and Dead Kennedys, how could any fan of punk and new wave pass this up?

The highlight for me is seeing XTC peform ""Respectable Street"".  Most XTC should know that the band never toured again after 1982, which makes this clip that much more worth picking up!

Well...what are you waiting for???",1165017600,6,455,4.512195121951219
2031193,5,B0001W0X2W,"Well at 42 years of age I was blessed to have seen some of these bands in their prime back in the day. Having seen the ""edited"" version on VH1 classic (left out 1/2 hour of footage -Surf Punks, Gary and the Cramps) someone needs to tell Miles Copeland to get this out on DVD. A true gem of a classic for the New-Wave era. The music was so original then. It is not hard to see where all of today's bands in the Indie- Alt world get their influence. Some great footage of Wall of Voodoo, Police, Magazine, Gang of Four, Echo & the Bunneymen and Devo. Also some great footage by some bands that never made the big-time like the Alley Cats. I would love to see A & M re-release the ""complete"" soundtrack on even CD. C'mon music companies, Rhino needs to strike a deal with Miles...  A true desert island gem!!",1162166400,4,805,4.193548387096774
2031194,5,B0001W0X2W,"Urgh as a whole is fairly good. Alot of good performances from bands like; X, Gang of Four, Pere Ubu, The Cramps, Devo, Gary Numan, and Au Pairs. However this movie could have been sooo much better. They left out alot, I mean alot of great bands that were around at that time. And they included alot of bands that were very insignifigant. However the performance from the Alleycats makes the whole movie very worth while. The first time I saw the Alleycats in this movie I had tears streaming down my face. It is so powerful. It's one of the greatest live performances I have ever seen. It's what music is all about. They give it all they got. Unfortunately there is only one Alleycats song in this movie. It's a revamped version of ""Nothing Means Nothing"". It still blows me away every time I see it. It's like they take all of their deepest emmotions and pour them on to the crowd of pogoing kids that get what they are doing. Powerful so powerful.

Yes, you deffinatley have to check Urgh out. Also X gives a hell of a performance as well.",1149724800,4,1042,4.371134020618556
2031195,5,B0001W0X2W,"I Found out why there's no Urgh! DVD yet...(here's why)

Because of an exclusive contract to publish this movie on a now dead format (CED), the contracts for the individual artists are missing. Because you can't renegotiate a contract without the original to amend, no one can touch this. Its currently owned by its original producer, Miles Copeland (founder of IRS records), and he has the film of THREE songs from each band in storage, but because of the legal landlock he cannot release it. If he does some day, we can look forward to a 6 hour 2 dvd special edition.

I've seen The Cramps three songs (Human Fly/I Was A Teenage Werewolf/Tear It Up) and they rock. Of course they used the most

""outrageously"" performed song for the film - while ""Human Fly"" was the better performance.

The XTC performance alone would make me buy this amazing film.

It's a sad that the original contracts are lost and I can only hope one day that they are found. Oh, human error!",1143331200,31,966,4.5606936416184976
2031196,5,B0001W0X2W,"This is the coolest concert video I've ever seen. I've had the VHS version for years, but am afraid to play it too often for fear of wearing out the tape. It's chock-full of live performances from numerous punk and new-wave bands. Most performances are awesome, with only a few stinkers. What great bands! The Police, Dead Kennedys, Oingo Boingo, XTC, Go-Go's, Wall Of Voodoo, Devo, Joan Jett, and much more. A virtual endless parade of wonderful late 70's and early 80's music. This is an extremely important historical document. For example, to my knowledge it is the only place you can see the Go-Go's original bass player on video. I don't understand how this amazing video has been allowed to sink into obscurity. Someone in the recording industry needs to get their act together and put this on DVD. I don't care if they charge $250.00 for the DVD, I would buy it! IT'S THAT GOOD!

If anyone reading this review knows the best way to petition the music industry to get a DVD made, please, please inform us via another review.",1133049600,5,1031,4.633879781420765
2031197,5,B0001W0X2W,"I (unfortunately) have this rare gem of a classic on beta (yes BETA!) and since my old betamax machine hasn't worked in about 15 to 20 years I haven't been able to watch it since, nor have I been able to find any VHS copies of it (let alone a DVD version.)

This was an amazing compilation of original bands from the 70's punk/new wave scene. A must at least for historical reasons and someone, somewhere, NEEDS to make this on DVD; If not to educate the kids of today that Green Day is not really punk, then to at least give some of us older folk who were actually there something to relive the moments by!",1128729600,5,607,4.188034188034188
2031198,5,B0001W0X2W,"Found this by accident a couple of years after it came out.  We played this through the stereo at parties (with the TV off, just the music).  This is what early 80's radio should have been, instead of the corporate AOR crap.

Dead Kennedy's, Gary Numan, Wall of Voodoo and Pere Ubu are my personal faveorites, but all but about 3 songs are great!",1126569600,6,346,4.375
2031199,4,B0001W0X2W,"I was actually at two of the concerts that were filmed for the URGH! documentary.  On two consecutive nights at the Santa Monica Civic, I saw X, The Cramps, The Dead Kennedys, Chelsea, The Members, Wall of Voodoo, Magazine, Pere Ubu, and I think the Dead Boys.

Anyway, the performances were pretty uniformly great (The Cramps were awful, but they were performing for the first time without Bryan Gregory, who'd just left the band) and there has got to be hours and hours of amazing footage that didn't make the final cut of the film.  Each band did around a half-hour or so on average, but only one song from each band made it into the final edit, so let's all pray for a really big box set someday.",1123977600,5,700,4.410852713178294
8016773,5,B0001W0X2W,"This is an amazing movie, I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",1492992000,,66,4.583333333333333
8016774,4,B0001W0X2W,"Took a while to get here, but worth the wait. Box and tape itself was in great shape, and it was so kind to rewind :). A few seconds of the first show were a little fuzzy and distorted, but overall the best few bucks I've spent in a while. Thanks again!",1466380800,,253,3.8846153846153846
8016775,5,B0001W0X2W,"Bought this on album when it first came out, because I was able to see many of these acts back in the day in NYC and Philly. Years ago when I saw it was on VHS I had to grab it, the tape was out-of-print by then and going for big $$$ (was supposedly released on LaserDisc as well). The film had limited theatrical release, but has shown up on TV from time to time. Now it's on a Widescreen DVD and a no-brainer purchase, historical essential stuff. Many of the acts featured were managed by POLICE drummer Stewart Copeland's brother Miles, of I.R.S. Records fame, and many recorded for that label as well. I've always wondered if there were FULL sets of all the performers recorded, the rumor is each band had three songs each filmed.  Would make a great limited edition set, eh? Considering what a licensing nightmare this must be, we're luck to have it at all (unless Miles Copland gets all the $$$ anyhow). Here's the track/performer/song rundown, with the album the original recording can be found on afterwards for those of you that might want to dig deeper. I've also added ten links (the limit) to albums I feel are essential for a collection. Those marked (*) are on the double-album/cassette version. There was also a 21-track CD available at one time which is now useless, buy this.....!

Considering this is a DVD-R release, the picture and sound are great. Some are complaining about the ""bare bones"" lack of a proper menu and chapters, they should be glad it's available at such a reasonable price! The initial release had a generic Warner Archive sleeve, the pressings since have a photo of the film poster, which shows that this has sold quite a few copies so far). You never know when stuff like this will go out-of-print, so get it NOW! The only URGH! about this is...I want more.....!",1459987200,,5707,6.342342342342342

8016777,5,B0001W0X2W,"I have a copy of this fabulous tape, and I regard it not only as one of my most treasured possessions, but a gateway into a Music Scene that no longer exists (a terrible crime), a look at a time when the Rock Music genre was at its zenith.

This film, released in 1981, features performances in several areas around the world. Both famed musicians (The Police, Devo, Gary Numan, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts) and virtually unknown acts (Chelsea, Aupairs, Splodgeness Abounds, Alley Cats) come together to exhibit virtually all styles of Rock Music represented in the 1980s. Along with music, other aspects of 1980s Pop Culture are revealed- from styles of clothing and hair, to famed places (such as the legendary Whiskey-A-Go-Go). ""URGH!"" also features a non-musical act, John Cooper Clarke. His poem ""Health Fanatic"" reflects the exercise craze of the early '80s.

Despite the fact that this is a documentary, there is no undue talk or nonsensical blabbering that mars so many documentaries. The acts & locations are shown in subtitles at the bottom of the screen, leaving the viewer free to watch the visual spectacles onstage. The sound is good, the reactions from the crowds are raw and uncensored, as it should be.

This special film should be noted for artists who have since passed on, such as Lux Interior (Lead Vocalist for 'The Cramps') and Klaus Nomi, whose final musical performance is noteworthy. It should also be noted that the producers behind this musical genius are Miles, Ian & Stewart Copeland (the last of which was the drummer for The Police).

So, lace up your Doc Martens, break out your Max headroom T-Shirts, spray up your spiked hair & rock out to ""URGH! A Music War"".",1285977600,,1695,4.814432989690721
8016778,5,B0001W0X2W,"The moment the opening sounds spew out of this movie you (if you are as old as I am) are immediately back in 1981 or 1982. I don't mean to be all ""things were better in the day"" about it . . . but they were. Bands in that era were no doubt as success-and-fame obsessed as any today BUT they also wallowed in a boiling pool of creative juices. Today's music is so hopelessly stale and dry and cynical and witless and boring and pointless and soulless and ugly and bland and repetitve and empty by comparison. Of course, that might just be nostalgia talking. Anyway, this movie is a Document of a musical time worth documenting. I defy anyone to watch/listen to XTC's performance of Respectable Street and not feel an uncontrollable urge to smash anything near at hand. Find it, buy it, relive it. Then go watch RepoMan.",1257292800,,818,4.423841059602649

I'm obsessed, too bad the legal issues keep this from getting released on DVD. I just ordered the Alley Cats album, unfortunately it does not contain the song that is on this concert ""Nothing Means Nothing Anymore"". Guess I'll have to do with the rest.

8016782,5,B0001W0X2W,"The very first time I watched ""Urgh!  A Music War"", I was 15 years old.  I was already a huge fan of punk/new wave music and this movie opened my eyes up to so many great bands.  I was a huge Police fan, so they were my faves, but I loved all of the performances.  I became a huge fan of X, Devo, Magazine, XTC (Respectable Street is etched in my mind), Klaus Nomi, Toyah Wilcox, Wall of Voodoo (I could never play that song out loud, but I loved it!), and so many, many others.

Music today just cannot compare to what was done in the early 80's.  This movie encapsulates all of that creative energy and fantastic sound.  I was lucky enough to tape it when it was showing on cable back in the 80's and I have it on VHS.  I may look into getting it converted to DVD because it is such a classic movie.",1173398400,2,801,3.993710691823899
