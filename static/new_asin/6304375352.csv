Leslie Danon stars and she also was one of the Writers and
one of the Producers of this Movie.
and I think This Movie is one of the Best Movies EVER.",1034553600,2,204,3.659090909090909
8223549,1,6304375352,"Sorry but this didn't make it for me. Being a Leif Garrett fan, I still didn't like this ""horror flick""as much as the one Leif did with his mom and  sister (""DEVIL TIMES FIVE""). I just didn't get the  point in this,but Leif did look nice (wow!)and it seems like he added a  little flavor to the movie as  ""Mrs. Dash"" would to bland food.  But I wouldn't recomend it to anyone Leif fan or not. ( Except if you are  looking at it to see Leif only and that's it.)",956102400,,460,4.0
