7760200,4,B01GGXDQYQ,"I always enjoy videos that don't have the same matches that was on 8 other DVDs. Then the amount of matches on here is crazy too. I mean the match loud alone is enough to cover the cost (I bought the digital copy on Prime, but now I can say even the dics price is fair too). Now I will say, if you couldn't enjoy anyone outside the ""Main Stars"" then you might not like this. Yes, they show up once the title started to mean something, but for the most part you're not going to be seeing Rock,Austin,Taker and HHH. BUT still, to see a title grow to the point it had real vaule after being a joke is still pretty cool. Funny enough my only problem was I wanted more talk (and less Foley, but out of the three (4) Raven, RVD and Foley (Dreamer) he's the host). I wanted to hear more indepth talk and less jokes. Hell the fact they managed to make Raven happy enough to come be on the video it seemed like a waste. Really this was a well put together video.",1477612800,,953,4.0476190476190474

7760202,5,B01GGXDQYQ,"I am an old school WWE wrestling fan from The Attitude Era! I love this DVD of the WWE history of the WWE hardcore title! It has the starting of the title back in 1998 when it was awarded to Mankind all the way to the end of the title in 2002! This has all of the hardcore matches you could think of even the pay-per-view ones! Almost all these matches have never been released on DVD until now! Some of the superstars on this dvd are as follows: Mankind, Undertaker, Hardcore & Crash Holly, Steve Blackman, Rob Van Dam, & many more! So if you're like me and you miss the old WWE days and want to relive some of the greatest hardcore matches ever in the WWE I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone!...",1475107200,,706,4.160583941605839
7760203,5,B01GGXDQYQ,"Before Extreme Rules and Falls Count Anywhere, hardcore matches were a regular deal with this championship that started out as a parody turned into a big deal from 1998-2002. This DVD is full of crazy, violent, and hilarious matches (48 on the DVD). Its awesome to relive the antics of Crash Holly and his 24/7 rule and later on Rob Van Dam dominating this hardcore division. A very fun watch!

P.S. this DVD has nearly every match from the early 2001 release.",1473206400,,460,4.609756097560975

This DVD chronicles the history of the championship from the debut & presentation of the title in 1998 to it's eventual merger into the Intercontinental Championship in 2002 hosted by former champions Mick Foley (complete with bad Al Snow jokes) & Rob Van Dam & Raven (with some occasional funny voiceovers by Tommy Dreamer) in a round table discussion discussing various subjects in regards to the the championship such as the early period of ""hardcore"", creativity of the matches, the 24/7 rules, analyzing different champions including themselves, the influence of ECW, and what period of the championship disappointed all of them to the point where it was compared to ""Dr. Hiney"" while it should also be noted that this set is rated TV-14.

Matches Include:
Mankind vs. Ken Shamrock - This was not only the first defense of the Hardcore Championship but a special ""Champion vs. Champion"" match with Shamrock being the Intercontinental Champion while Mr. McMahon & his associates watched from the top of the stage.  Mankind came into match with his ""corporate makeover"" wearing a suit which was eventually used as a weapon by both men with the action spilling to the floor with weapons & the environment used in different ways as the fight continued all the way to the stage area in what a physical match that set the standard for what to expect in his new division.

Ladder Match: Mankind vs. Big Boss Man - Boss Man was a member of Mr. McMahon's ""The Corporation"" stable at the time & his job here was to take away the only thing Mankind had left in his Hardcore Championship while it should be noted that Shawn Michaels was the Commissioner at the time & did commentary at ringside. Mankind was attacked by Boss Man on the floor right away with the nightstick before he was able to recover & used the steps & the ladder on Boss Man. Foley was able to use the ladder to his advantage various times such as dropping elbow drops while Boss Man was wedged inside & even doing a clothesline off it at one point but overall, this was more about pushing the story of the The Corporation continuing to screw Mankind while further push his feud with The Rock than anything else as this was more of a hardcore match than an actual ladder match.

The fight continued to outside of the building & made it's way to the Mississippi River where both men continued to use whatever they could from road signs to a wheelbarrow, and even the camera getting hit with a broken piece of wood.

Both men started this fight very physically busting glass objects & whatever they could get their hands on around ringside eventually leading up to some impactful moves executed the stage with the announcers questioning how certain objects they used got there in the first place as it ultimately came down to one of their competitor's past coming back to haunt them.

Big Boss Man vs. Al Snow - It should be noted that former champion Road Dogg made it clear he wanted a shot at the championship he was never defeated for so he joined commentary following the action throughout the match.

[WWF Hardcore; Falls Count Anywhere]

Hardcore Holly vs. Crash - Hardcore Holly won the first ever Hardcore Battle Royal the previous night at WrestleMania 2000 so Crash was looking to get it back in match that showed both men had no issues using whatever weapon it took but one man showed he had no issues doing whatever it ""cost"" to get what he wanted.
""RAW"" Apr. '00

Crash vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn - This was under unique circumstances as it was not only another case of a champion challenging for the title but a champion from another promotion as Tazz had won the ECW Championship days earlier but this was more significant for how someone took advantage of the 24/7 rule completely changing the entire complex of the originally scheduled match.

""SmackDown"" July '00

Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman - It should be noted that Shane won the championship earlier in the week (which is available on the Blu-Ray edition) using various shenanigans causing Blackman to stalk Shane all night leading up to match with Shane constantly trying to run away only for Blackman to finally get his hands on him & showed that he was more focus on torturing Shane than winning before Shane tried to use the same tactics that worked earlier in the week only to not only have a different result but also cause him to have what was up to that point the most memorable visual ever seen in the division.
SummerSlam '00

""RAW"" Dec. '00

Raven vs. Crash - Crash had his cousin Molly Holly at his side as Raven brought what would be his trademark shopping cart full of different & unusual weapons as they fought throughout the building using whatever they could get their hands on leading to some jokes & bad puns on commentary with not every attempt at offense paying off how they wanted as this fight went all the way outside where some unexpected help came into play.

""RAW"" Feb. '01

Kane vs. Rhyno - Commissioner Regal made this match on the spot as Kane had Undertaker in his corner while Rhyno had Edge & Christian making this a glorified tag team handicap match only for the match to eventually come down to one or one while others who had an interest in this match decided to make their presence known but it should be noted that this match was only the first step in what was ""lost history"" made for one superstar based off what would happen later in the night.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '01

Rhyno vs. Raven - This match started off with a bang & never let up as Rhyno's momentum worked in his favor running through Raven & his objects but also unable to stop himself in time whenever it was used against him in the ring or on the floor causing him to land on weapons from open chairs to stop signs including one time he missed hitting the gore on Raven but ran into something else that was another time we saw something in a match that we had never seen before as both men went non-stop from beginning to end in what was been called one of the most memorable matches in the history of the division.
Backlash '01
[WWF Hardcore]

Big Show vs. Chris Jericho - Jericho once again challenged for the championship while currently holding another title which in this case was the Tag Team Titles while not coming into this match 100% due to being sore from his T.L.C. match only days earlier as he attempted to the strategy of ""hit & run"" using the weapons to make his regular offense more impactful while Show used his size & power to dominate Jericho from using weapons to just easily tossing Jericho around with bigger story being who was the last man standing.

Vengeance '01

Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy - This started before the bell with Taker dominating with his power while Jeff attempted to ""hit & move"" & take high risk that didn't pay off allowing Taker to continue to dominate delivering a beating where it was clear he was more focused on punishing Jeff & intimidate Lita than trying to win the match to the point where another person who had his issues with Jeff & Lita had sympathy for them.
""RAW"" Dec. '01

Undertaker vs. Tajiri - The first time the Crusierweight Champion challenged for the championship while Tajiri had Torrie Wilson at ringside as Tajiri's relied on his style of fast strikes & kicks with his superior speed while taking advantage of the stipulation using tactics as defensive while Taker was able to fight off some of his signature moves & using weapons still being able to catch Tajiri & working over a bodypart as he once again was more focused on punishing his opponent than winning.

As I said before this division was defined by the words ""chaotic"" & ""fun"" as this DVD showcased some of the toughest & crazy & entertaining moments from the Attitude Era where it began to the Ruthless Aggression era where it ended.  The positives is that the set is TV-14 as WWE programming was during that time so nothing was heavily edited or censored while the only real negatives I could say is that I would have replaced some of the matches that weren't relevant or good quality with others that I personally felt had a more deserving spot on here (Hardcore Battle Royal at WrestleMania 2000 & Road Dogg's title win on the regular edition while the British Bulldog's return where he won the championship only because it marked the beginning of his final run, another of the Hardcore Holly/Al Snow matches from '99, and highlights of the WrestleMania X-8 madness in the Blu-Ray).  In the end, it's a championship that definitely had it's various moments that are fun to relive & it's a set I recommend to those who want to relive the crazy four years of this championship.",1467331200,6,28052,4.591090691170595

Bob Holly vs. Bart Gunn - This match had a lot of history behind it as this was another ""Champion vs. Champion"" match as Bart Gunn was the Brawl For All tournament champion, both were former tag team championship partners as the New Midnight Express, and Holly was the only person Bart didn't defeat in the Brawl For All by knockout.  Both men started this fight very physically busting glass objects & whatever they could get their hands on around ringside eventually leading up to some impactful moves executed the stage with the announcers questioning how certain objects they used got there in the first place as it ultimately came down to one of their competitor's past coming back to haunt them.
""RAW"" Feb. '99
[WWF Hardcore]

Big Boss Man vs. Al Snow - It should be noted that former champion Road Dogg made it clear he wanted a shot at the championship he was never defeated for so he joined commentary following the action throughout the match.  The match didn't even make it to the ring as it started out at the stage entrance to backstage in less than a minute with various weapons being used & broken including Snow's own mascot Pepper with the action being unable to be contained inside the building going all the way across the street into different areas of the bar using whatever they could get their hands on including fans handing them items to use in a pretty wild match.
SummerSlam '99

Al Snow vs. Steve Blackman
Jakked  October 9, 1999

Test vs. Gangrel - This match went from ringside to backstage seeing some unusual objects used from a hardhat & musical instrument to the actual snow outside the building that had some innocent people getting in the way of the action while Luna, Gangrel's wife, had no issues getting physically involved from the start of action causing Test to fight in what was an unofficial inter-gender handicap match.
""SmackDown"" Jan. '00

Test vs. Crash Holly - Test easily dominating Crash including tossing him into the crowd while Crash used the weapons & environment to his advantage along with his lighter size for high risk that didn't always pay off but ultimately came down to unexpected help based off what happened right before the match.

[WWF Hardcore]

Crash Holly vs. Tazz - This match got taken from the ring to the crowd in the opening seconds before going backstage in a short contest that saw someone put into a section of the building that we've never seen before but more memorable for what happened afterwords that changed the entire hardcore division for the rest of it's existence.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '00
[WWF Hardcore]

Crash vs. Mean Street Posse - This took place at the airport which saw another WWE superstar & a maintenance match get involved in the action that was one of the early showing of how this title was a ""hot potato"" under the new 24/7 rule.
""RAW"" Mar. '00
[WWF Hardcore]

Crash vs. Headbangers - This was probably the most famous match during Crash's reign as the ""Houdini Of Hardcore"" as it took place in the family fun center of Funtime U.S.A. as they went through the arcade & playpen complete with Jerry Lawler's ""Pac-Man"" sound effects.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '00
[WWF Hardcore; Falls Count Anywhere]

Hardcore Holly vs. Crash - Hardcore Holly won the first ever Hardcore Battle Royal the previous night at WrestleMania 2000 so Crash was looking to get it back in match that showed both men had no issues using whatever weapon it took but one man showed he had no issues doing whatever it ""cost"" to get what he wanted.
""RAW"" Apr. '00

Crash vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn - This was under unique circumstances as it was not only another case of a champion challenging for the title but a champion from another promotion as Tazz had won the ECW Championship days earlier but this was more significant for how someone took advantage of the 24/7 rule completely changing the entire complex of the originally scheduled match.
""RAW"" Apr. '00

Crash vs. Mean Street Posse - This occurred at the circus with the Posse using a tactic including getting the referee involved with it to try to win the championship.

""SmackDown"" May '00
[WWF Hardcore]

Steve Blackman vs. X-Pac - X-Pac's tag partner Road Dogg was on commentary for this match as both men gave each other as much punishment as they received from using the same weapons in unique ways to have face off's with different weapons as this was a different type of match for the championship with both men being martial arts experts.
""SmackDown"" July '00

Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman - It should be noted that Shane won the championship earlier in the week (which is available on the Blu-Ray edition) using various shenanigans causing Blackman to stalk Shane all night leading up to match with Shane constantly trying to run away only for Blackman to finally get his hands on him & showed that he was more focus on torturing Shane than winning before Shane tried to use the same tactics that worked earlier in the week only to not only have a different result but also cause him to have what was up to that point the most memorable visual ever seen in the division.
SummerSlam '00
[WWF Hardcore]

Steve Blackman vs. Edge vs. Christian - Edge & Christian made it clear that they were going to work together from the start as they used the weapons & numbers advantage only for Blackman to counter with his martial arts style & weapons of his own in what was a glorified handicap match.
""RAW"" Oct. '00
[WWF Hardcore]

Steve Blackman vs. Raven vs. Hardcore Holly - This match started before all the participants got to the ring using whatever they could get their hands on to use from the crowd & backstage area to the parking lot with the big story being how you never forget that the title is always being defended 24/7.
""RAW"" Dec. '00

Raven vs. Crash - Crash had his cousin Molly Holly at his side as Raven brought what would be his trademark shopping cart full of different & unusual weapons as they fought throughout the building using whatever they could get their hands on leading to some jokes & bad puns on commentary with not every attempt at offense paying off how they wanted as this fight went all the way outside where some unexpected help came into play.
""RAW"" Jan. '01

Raven vs. Big Show - Raven attempted to use the same strategies that have helped him in the past with most of them not working to his advantage before others attempted to capitalize on the 24/7 rule & get involved in other ways with winner ultimately dominating his way to victory.
No Way Out '01

Big Show vs. The Rock vs. Kurt Angle - This was not only another ""champion vs. champion"" encounter in the history of the championship but also the first time the WWE Champion challenged for the title as this was setup to be punishment for Big Show getting involved in their championship match the night before as all 3 men interacted with each other in various ways such as two opponents working over each other only for the third to get involved as well along with some double teaming to take out the most dangerous threat in the match before things got completely out of hand to the point where the match ended in pinfall that has never been seen before or since.
""RAW"" Feb. '01
[WWF Hardcore]

Raven vs. Chris Jericho - Jericho was the current Intercontinental Champion as they went back & forth with Jericho using the weapons to make his signature offense more impactful fighting outside the ring to a certain area backstage that had an effect on more than just the two competitors in this match.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '01

Raven vs. Kane vs. Big Show - This match started before all three men made their way to the ring as this brawled all the way through the crowd & backstage destroying everything in their way from windows & walls to part of the stage even running each other at one point including one man constantly being used as a weapon against his opponents in a crazy three way brawl.
WrestleMania X-7
[WWF Hardcore]

Kane vs. Steven Richards - This was a quick brawl with Richards' offense having little to no effect while Kane dominated causing him to rely on his fellow Right To Censor members only for Kane to have some backup of his own.
""RAW"" Apr. '01

Kane vs. Rhyno - Commissioner Regal made this match on the spot as Kane had Undertaker in his corner while Rhyno had Edge & Christian making this a glorified tag team handicap match only for the match to eventually come down to one or one while others who had an interest in this match decided to make their presence known but it should be noted that this match was only the first step in what was ""lost history"" made for one superstar based off what would happen later in the night.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '01

Rhyno vs. Raven - This match started off with a bang & never let up as Rhyno's momentum worked in his favor running through Raven & his objects but also unable to stop himself in time whenever it was used against him in the ring or on the floor causing him to land on weapons from open chairs to stop signs including one time he missed hitting the gore on Raven but ran into something else that was another time we saw something in a match that we had never seen before as both men went non-stop from beginning to end in what was been called one of the most memorable matches in the history of the division.
Backlash '01
[WWF Hardcore]

Big Show vs. Chris Jericho - Jericho once again challenged for the championship while currently holding another title which in this case was the Tag Team Titles while not coming into this match 100% due to being sore from his T.L.C. match only days earlier as he attempted to the strategy of ""hit & run"" using the weapons to make his regular offense more impactful while Show used his size & power to dominate Jericho from using weapons to just easily tossing Jericho around with bigger story being who was the last man standing.
""RAW"" May '01

Test vs. Rhyno - Both men brawled from the ring through the crowd to backstage with somethings not breaking how they were expected to in a quick match that had something happen that nobody expected to ever happen up to that point...especially in Madison Square Garden.

Mike Awesome vs. Jeff Hardy - Awesome was dominate with his power catching Hardy in mid-air & throwing him around while Hardy used weapons in unique ways from different areas of the ring with the surprise of not only who decided to get involved & who they targeted.
""SmackDown"" July '01

Jeff Hardy vs. Rob Van Dam - RVD attacked Matt Hardy before the match as they went into a series of counters & reversals leading to stalemates as Jeff was able to take advantage of RVD showcasing his ego or catching him in an compromising position on more than one occasion while RVD was able execute his unique style of offense throughout different areas in & out of the ring not previously seen in WWE while also being able to counter Jeff in mid-move with one of his own including one instance that sent him off the stage as it ultimately came down to one daredevil taking advantage of another one's crash & burn in what was one received as one of the top matches of the year & in the history of the division.
Invasion '01
[Rob Van Dam: One Of A Kind]

Rob Van Dam vs. Tajiri - Both men weren't able to get an advantage over the other as a specific weapon in unique ways that hadn't been previously seen as along with attempts at submission in a fast paced match between two evenly matched opponents who have a similar style of using their ""educated feet.""
""RAW"" July '01

Rob Van Dam vs. Kurt Angle - Angle used his various mat wrestling styles from submission to mat wrestling while RVD used his educated feet for different kicks & aerial moves with both men using a chair to their advantage when possible in a match that couldn't be contained in the match while another man had an interest in this match based off his recent issues involving both men.
""RAW"" Sept. '01

Rob Van Dam vs. The Rock - Rock was one-half of the Tag Team Champions as they went back & forth making their way from the ring to the stage area using the environment to their advantage before coming back to the ring continuing to use the weapons to make their offense more impactful while other's who had an interest in both men made their presence known.
""SmackDown"" Oct. '01

Rob Van Dam vs. Undertaker - RVD used a ""stick & move"" strategy using his speed & quick strikes along with taking high risk early on only for Taker to be able to catch RVD on more than one occasion taking the action through the crowd using whatever they could get their hands on from fans or the environment itself to the stage area with both men using elements of that area along with more weapons to their advantage before one man delivered a major move that the other couldn't have gotten up from.
Vengeance '01

Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy - This started before the bell with Taker dominating with his power while Jeff attempted to ""hit & move"" & take high risk that didn't pay off allowing Taker to continue to dominate delivering a beating where it was clear he was more focused on punishing Jeff & intimidate Lita than trying to win the match to the point where another person who had his issues with Jeff & Lita had sympathy for them.
""RAW"" Dec. '01

Undertaker vs. Tajiri - The first time the Crusierweight Champion challenged for the championship while Tajiri had Torrie Wilson at ringside as Tajiri's relied on his style of fast strikes & kicks with his superior speed while taking advantage of the stipulation using tactics as defensive while Taker was able to fight off some of his signature moves & using weapons still being able to catch Tajiri & working over a bodypart as he once again was more focused on punishing his opponent than winning.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '01

Undertaker vs. Maven - Maven arguably had the highlight of his entire career a month earlier eliminating Taker from the Royal Rumble only for him to be repeatedly punished for it since leading up to this match with his Tough Enough trainer Al Snow attempting to help him through teaching or even getting physically involved only for Taker to be completely dominate continuing to punish him & anyone else who attempted to get involved before someone else decided to give his own receipt.
""SmackDown"" Feb. '02

Bubba Ray Dudley vs. Raven - Both men came out the gate using different weapons to hit each other with from your typical trash can lids & cookie sheets to unique weapons such a blackboard & stop sign in with the bigger picture being how the 24/7 rule coming into effect once again only for someone to be left laying ""crying the blues.""
""RAW"" Apr. '02

Steven Richards vs. Booker T - One man had the advantage while attempting to toss in weapons only for them to be tossed right out only for other weapons to still be utilized by both men in unique ways from Booker utilizing his various kicks to Steven focusing on specific areas of the body with the 24/7 rule coming into play more than once.
Insurrextion '02

""RAW"" May '02

Bradshaw vs. Jeff Hardy - Bradshaw had the superior size advantage which came to his advantage being able to catch & overpower Hardy along with beat him down with his brawling tactics while Hardy relied on his superior speed & daredevil offense including using a specific object to his advantage with both men not holding back when it came to using weapons against their opponent.
""RAW"" July '02

Tommy Dreamer vs. Bradshaw - This match didn't make it's way to the ring & got started destroying the backstage area fighting through the crowd with weapons that were the signature of both men being used along with the ringside environment coming into play & both men continuing to get more physical as the match progressed.
""RAW"" Aug. '02

Tommy Dreamer vs. Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam - This was a title Unification Match as both men had stalemate early on as both men utilized the same weapons in different ways from a kendo stick to a ladder while also being able to use the weapons to make their own signature moves more impactful or for unique counters to each other's offense as it came down to one man being able to take advantage of another's ""crash & burn"" in the final Hardcore Championship match.
""RAW"" Aug. '02

(Blu-Ray) Al Snow vs. Big Boss Man - Boss Man held Snow's pet dog Pepper hostage at ringside in order to get a title match with Snow utilizing weapons while Boss Man kept taking advantage of Snow's distraction of being more focused on Pepper than the match itself.
""SmackDown"" Aug. '99

(Blu-Ray) Crash vs. Mark Henry - Crash attempted to use whatever he could to get the advantage while Henry used his size & power but it was when someone else got involved that they ended up creating one of the most infamous moments in WWE that we've never seen before or since.
""RAW"" Feb. '00

(Blu-Ray) Crash Holly vs. Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn - One fall to a finish as this started is the isleway before the bell & quickly went to the stage area with more than one opponent climbing & coming off the stage with pieces of the structure broken & used as a weapon as we saw multiple objects used as weapons along with short term alliances made & long term alliances fighting against each other in what was non-stop action from start to finish.
Backlash '00
[WWF Hardcore]

(Blu-Ray) Steve Blackman vs. Test - Blackman was originally scheduled to defend his championship against someone else before Test decided to attack backstage fighting through the crowd to ringside using weapons before Blackman was able to recover using the weapons himself & taking advantage of any miscommunication between Test & anyone else who decided to get involved before one man was able to take advantage of how the situation played out.
""RAW"" Aug. '00

(Blu-Ray) Hardcore Championship Invitational Match: Steve Blackman vs. Crash vs. Test vs. Perry Saturn vs. Sho Funaki vs. Al Snow - This match took place under the same rules as the Hardcore Battle Royal at WrestleMania months earlier where the match had a 10 minute time limit which the championship could change hands an unlimited amount of times during only for the man who was the current champion at the end of the time limit being the winner & given a 24 hour rest from the 24/7 rule.  This match saw many various highlights such as various weapons used from objects to the opponents themselves, all sorts of high risk being taken in & outside of the ring, what the managers Trish & Terri got when they attempted to get involved, the action being taken all around around the building from ringside to the crowd to backstage with the championship changing hands different times throughout the contest.
Unforgiven '00

(Blu-Ray) Rob Van Dam vs. Kurt Angle - This started in the isleway with Angle bouncing RVD's head off whatever he could at ringside only for RVD to fight back into the the crowd & using the barricade to this advantage as both men used weapons like a chair in different ways with this ultimately coming down to others trying to get involved allowing one man to take advantage of the situation.
""RAW"" Aug. '01

(Blu-Ray) Rob Van Dam vs. Chris Jericho - Both men were evenly matched early on with back & forth exchanges ending in stalemates before Jericho took advantage of RVD's ego attempting to neutralize his speed & high risk offense while RVD was still able to rely on his educated feet as both men were able to counter the other's signature maneuvers while utilizing the ladder that came into play in various ways leading to quite a few unique visuals that haven't been seen in the division up to this point from different holds & submissions applied to the falls & dives off of it with both men utilizing the ringside environment & other weapons to their advantage in a match that I consider a ""lost classic"" when it comes to the history of the championship that was very competitive from start to finish.
Unforgiven '01

(Blu-Ray) Undertaker vs. Big Show - Show took the fight to Taker literally chasing him up on the ramp on his bike beating him back to the ring with Taker's offense having no effect as Show was able to beat Taker down until Taker was able to neutralize him heavily focusing on a part of the body using whatever weapons possible along with other desperate to the point where it effected Show throughout the rest of the match.
""SmackDown"" Jan. '02

(Blu-Ray) Goldust vs. Rob Van Dam - RVD took the fight to Goldust before the bell using his high risk maneuvers & utilizing weapons around the ringside environment while Goldust was able to take advantage of his high risk not paying off using the weapons to his advantage with someone else at ringside getting caught in the action.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '02

(Blu-Ray) Bubba Ray Dudley vs. Booker T - We have a special type of ""battle"" before the match as both men brawled against each other using weapons & their signature maneuvers in a short contest that's only significant for what would be on the first interactions between two men that would be associated with each other for a significant amount of time.
""RAW"" Apr. '02

As I said before this division was defined by the words ""chaotic"" & ""fun"" as this DVD showcased some of the toughest & crazy & entertaining moments from the Attitude Era where it began to the Ruthless Aggression era where it ended.  The positives is that the set is TV-14 as WWE programming was during that time so nothing was heavily edited or censored while the only real negatives I could say is that I would have replaced some of the matches that weren't relevant or good quality with others that I personally felt had a more deserving spot on here (Hardcore Battle Royal at WrestleMania 2000 & Road Dogg's title win on the regular edition while the British Bulldog's return where he won the championship only because it marked the beginning of his final run, another of the Hardcore Holly/Al Snow matches from '99, and highlights of the WrestleMania X-8 madness in the Blu-Ray).  In the end, it's a championship that definitely had it's various moments that are fun to relive & it's a set I recommend to those who want to relive the crazy four years of this championship.",1467331200,4,27370,4.585924713584288

I got this looking for Crash Holly's 24/7 matches as well as Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman, both of which is on this. great matches in good video and audio. their are one or two matches that aren't great but the others are fantastic.

The collection is hosted by Mic Fowley, Raven, and Rob Van Dam, which sadly is the weakness of this collection. between bad camera angles, poor audio and bad dialog, their scenes just fall apart. Fowley clearly has a script that he had to adhere to while the others were clearly flying by the seat of their pants. If Fowley had given more energy and time into this, he could have given more that this poor mediator that has to keep the others in line. honestly they should have all been on a script or allowed to completely improvise. But no, every time we cut back to them they come of as people that were here for the paycheck. there are a few moments where they talk genuinely about there time and thoughts about the championship, but those are few and far between. Would have been better with just a narrator or just as a collections of matches.

Still, if you like great, innovative matches that show off the talents of wrestler who will probably never get their own dvd. just skip over the discussion chapters and enjoy these great matches.",1484611200,,1354,4.522448979591837

Also if your a fan of the original ECW they take a look into how that influenced the WWE Hardcore title.",1525910400,,259,4.098039215686274
8762901,5,B01GGXDQYQ,"They say the 80's was the golden age of wrestling with WCW but I have to disagree, I think ECW and the attitude era of WWF now WWE with the ECW invasion were the best it's ever going to get.  Don't even bring up the WWE modern day it's become a joke, they should just sell it to Disney.  Lets face it the early 2000's of WWF was the golden age of hardcore wrestling, it was brutal and it was all due to the ECW invasion and demise in 2000.  If you guys are looking for ECW bootlegs on Blu-ray just do a search on the site iOffer for the best in ECW hardcore action, which in my humble opinion is the best decade of hardcore wrestling, there are about 9 Blu-ray's covering the hardcore/TNN series by year.  1993-2000, check them out.
  Glad to have this WWE hardcore history in my collection. It might be WWE but I will be cheering EC Fn' W!",1525737600,,840,4.091463414634147
