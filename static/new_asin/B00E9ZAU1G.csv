8603089,3,B00E9ZAU1G,Not as good as some of the classics but still nice. Don't watch it while your tired it will but u to sleep. Only my opinion.,1398902400,,124,3.8076923076923075
8603090,1,B00E9ZAU1G,"This is definitely not a family-friendly movie.  The quality of the black and white features is very poor and grainy.  Within the first 7 minutes of the feature color movie, there were several sexual references made.  Would not recommend as a family nor a feel-good Christmas movie.  Not suitable to watch in front of children.",1386028800,4,327,4.890909090909091
