8747884,3,B01AO6WH5A,"I mistakenly bought this for my middle school students to view. I was glad I previewed it because it was totally inappropriate for kids under 16. I wish the publishers description had included some indication as to which ages should view this DVD.  The DVD was exellent, I just didn't like the description that Amazon published for it.",1271203200,13,335,4.775862068965517
8747885,5,B01AO6WH5A,"Until the ""Universe of Keith Haring"" came out the only documentary on dvd was ""Drawing The Line"" which came out in 1989. This new documentary is a welcome addition and provides fans a complete overview of Haring's life and work. From his early years growing up in Kutztown to his early years in NYC and through the height of his short life and career this truly a complete and satisfying look at one of the great artists of the 1980's. There are conversations with family members and friends and other artists that provide background and insight into who Keith Haring was. Of course, this documentary ends sadly since he lived such a short life but this is a great way to celebrate it. This is an easy 5-star highly recommended movie for fans of Keith Haring.

And in case you haven't seen ""Drawing The Line"" that won't provide you with any new information, but you will get to see some imagery and footage not in this newer documentary. And since it was made in 1989 it has an 80's feel to it which helps take you back to the time when Haring was alive so it is also recommended for Haring fans.",1265760000,4,1096,4.425742574257426
8747886,5,B01AO6WH5A,"My first awareness of the art of Keith Haring was in the 1986 video for the Grace Jones song ""I'm Not Perfect"". In stop action we witness Keith creating a perfect huge circular mural on the blank fabric of Grace's dress. We don't see that particular piece in ""The Universe of Keith Haring"", but we do get an amazing detailed insight into the creative and personal life of a true genius. For Keith the personal was certainly political - his honesty regarding his homosexuality was integral to his work. Lives have been saved (from HIV and homophobia) and the world made a better place because of this.

We learn that Keith was a basically nice guy, but he was determined to fully enjoy his life day by day. He didn't give a tinker's cuss for whoever might already have romantic links to the object of his desire.

""The Universe Of Keith Haring"" screened at the Brisbane Queer Film Festival 2008 and I was immediately convinced by the Spanish subtitled preview DVD that this is a film that I had to own (with subtitles only as an option). This film ranks among top ten LGBT/Queer documentaries. For others it will rate highly purely for the revelation of Keith's unique aristic vision, his skills, his extraordinary productivity - and his globally significant legacy.",1232928000,3,1265,4.719457013574661
