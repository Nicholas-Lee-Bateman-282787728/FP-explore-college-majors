8275658,4,B0019Z3P6Q,"I agree with the other reviews that this movie is very slow. I used the 10 frame forward a lot, but I'm glad I stuck with it. The country is beautiful. It is so moving to be so immersed in the culture. Yes, the women are treated severely, but the kindness of the man who helped them is amazing. I personally liked the ending. I'm not sure I totally understood what happened to the younger woman's husband, but I did enjoy the possibility of the budding romance between the older man and woman. Overall the movie was fascinating, and without open violence or vulgarity.",1440806400,,568,4.471153846153846
8275659,3,B0019Z3P6Q,"If you are interested in Algerian countryside and authentic scenery then this is worth watching. The plot is slow to unwind but eventually reveals itself, A unique movie with a finale that could have been better.",1433548800,,212,4.916666666666667
8275660,4,B0019Z3P6Q,"A powerful, interesting movie set in Algeria during the 1990s. Try to hang in there during the first half of the movie, which is slow going and seems to bring out the least likable attributes of the two women doctors who are the central focus of the film. By the end the essential humanity of these women and the tremendous odds they have to battle to maintain any dignity as women who aren't totally subservient to men is revealed. The movie gives a clear view of the Salafist (fundamentalist) Islamist rebellion, which surfaced throughout the middle east at this time. This movie is very contemporary, with much to recommend it.",1431216000,,630,4.736363636363636
8275661,5,B0019Z3P6Q,"This is a film about the political strife in Algeria during the 1990's, and its impact upon ordinary lives.  Amel, a Westernized woman, is also a doctor married to a journalist who is missing.  It is understood that this is related to a series of articles he published condemning the current political situation.

Together with another woman from the hospital where she works, Amel goes in search of her husband, whom she believes fundamentalists have kidnapped and hidden in a remote section of mountains.  Amel's companion is also a veteran of the war with France,  and tries to use her connections with her previous comrades to trace Amel's husband. Throughout the movie we watch how these highly educated women are abused by men and treated with no respect.

The film is beautifully made, the actors terrific and the Algerian scenery quite spectacular.  The ending is a little ambiguous.  Why the writer/director did that is not clear.  The ending certainly does not add to the film.

The movie is well worth watching, a very human story set amidst political turmoil and very realistic.",1231632000,5,1090,4.93956043956044
