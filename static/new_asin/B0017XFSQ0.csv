What I love about this DVD:

**Tracey's meticulous attention to form.  She will start most exercises with smaller, subtle movements like imprinting your back on the ground before you start doing crunches.  This really helped me focus on my form and on the exact muscles I should be using.  It is so easy with core work to forget to breathe and to not think about form.  Tracey's gentle reminders were perfect and not at all annoying.
**the time flew by since each section worked your core differently, e.g. you work lower core and then move on to crunches.
**Tracey seemed very relaxed and natural in front of the camera.  She was encouraging, yet inspired you to push yourself.
**the timing of the lower back exercises at the halfway point in the workout.  My abs are literally screaming by this point and I welcomed the change!

Modifications are shown, with a bosu and also less intense versions of many exercises.

This DVD is 50 minutes of non-stop core, which may be a bit much for some folks.  This DVD is well-chaptered, so you can always do a few chapters instead of the entire routine.  A natural split would be to do the first half of the workout (up until the back extensions on the stability ball) one day and the rest of the workout another day.
Tracey does seem to be `yelling' when she gives instructions.  Her voice may get on some people's nerves.  This didn't bother me since I was enjoying the workout so much.

I recommend this DVD for core work over her subsequent DVD, Core Blast.",1276560000,5,1717,4.562091503267974
