8594658,5,B00DN3U6Z0,"This is a wonderful video to view, particularly if you are going to these islands or want an idea of what to expect.  It has a scientific bent, explaining the evolutionary process, which keeps it from just being a puff tourism piece.",1464739200,,233,4.5476190476190474
8594659,5,B00DN3U6Z0,"What I liked most about this title is how lively it is,  unlike your traditional narrated BBC documentaries.
