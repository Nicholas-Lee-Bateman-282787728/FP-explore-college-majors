Other than missing the Universal-International logo at the beginning, this region-free import looks exactly like my DVD-R.  Terrible quality, almost unwatchable on a large screen monitor.  Probably the worst picture quality of any of my several thousand DVDs/DVD-Rs/Blu-Rays.  And that includes a few from Alpha.  Way overpriced.",1282003200,2,482,5.194805194805195
218262,5,6300183831,One of the best performances of Kirk Douglas in a masterpiece directed by King Vidor. Jeanne Crain and Richard Boone as the villain also give praiseworthy performances. MAN WITHOUT A STAR can be found now in a superb DVD zone 2 release with remastered images and sound at Amazon.fr.,1191628800,,282,4.775510204081633
218263,4,6300183831,"Kirk Douglas is perfectly cast as Dempsey Rae, the happy wanderer cowboy, expert in guns and horses... Rae rides the open range of the Old West with an eye for the ladies and a fancy way with six-shooters...

The theme of the film is the gradual disappearance of freedom as the Wild West settles down to business and puts up barbed wire to mark the lines of investment... Dempsey Rae is a happy wanderer, content to move further and further west to escape the fences... He meets up with a naive farm-boy ""Texas"" (William Campbell) who yearns to be a man of action and almost as inept... In Dempsey ""Texas"" finds the right tutor...

The two team up and get themselves a job working for a beautiful ranch owner, Reed Bowman (Jeanne Crain), who turns out to be as unscrupulous as she is attractive... Reed is a 'cattle queen' who rides down the fences of her neighbors carrying the action to its absolute limit in order to prosper and make money...

Dempsey is happy to work for the lady for $30 a month and even happier to make love to her but he draws the line at laying his life for her in range wars... He quits the crooked beauty and drifts into the nearby town, to renew his acquaintance with Idonee (Claire Trevor), a madam with the proverbial heart of gold...

The likable Dempsey is rocked out of his contentment by his successor at the Bowment Ranch, a brute named Steve Miles (Richard Boone) who feels he has to defeat every man in sight, especially when motivated by his glamorous boss...

""Man Without a Star"" is a mighty satisfactory entertaining Western, once its premise is established... William Campbell helps Douglas make it so... The two performances are sympathetic, with Campbell looking to Douglas for leadership...

Douglas comes out as a likable star when he announces his presence by throwing his 'good looking' saddle on a window; he is graceful when he combs his hair with water from a goldfish bowl; and he is charming when he plays the banjo and sings a gaily ballad called: ""And the Moon Grew Brighter and Brighter.""

Jack Elam is cast as the leering, treacherous gunslinger trying to knife Douglas...

Director King Vidor had long established his ability with action sequences and pictorial scope in films like ""Northwest Passage,"" and ""Duel in the Sun,"" and ""Man Without a Star"" has a full measure of Vidor directed bar room fights, stampedes and chases...

With a lot of color, humor and action Vidor's motion picture is a traditional cattle range movie distinguished by its sheer energy and forceful visual style... The film traces some sex interest between Douglas and Crain, centering on a bathtub 'inside' the house...",1162857600,9,2653,4.737527114967462

218265,5,6300183831,"This is probably my favorite Kirk Douglas western. Although it has plenty of action this is not just another action western. Rather it deals with the implacable transition of the west from open range available to all to individually-controlled patches of range that are fenced off with barbed wire. Dempsey Rae (Douglas' character) loves open range and keeps drifting north to avoid the barbed wire which destroys it. Finally, however, he realizes that the small ranchers must fence off the range to protect themselves from the massive herds of a greedy rancher and her ruthless foreman and helps string and protect the wire that he hates so thoroughly.

Man Without A Star is one my all time favorite western movies. Kirk Douglas as Dempsey Rae, the wandering cowboy looking for progress to slow down and the day of the open range to come to an end. He's trying to find a place where they don't use barbed wire to fence their land.
Jeanne Crain as the new ranch owner of The Triangle Ranch, who wants to make a million running as much cattle as possible; not caring who she steps on or why, as long as she gets her way.
There's lots of gun play, a cattle stampede and Richard Boone as the bad guy..A great western.",1366934400,4,886,4.279761904761905
218397,3,6300183831,"This 1955 movie is a fairly routine western about the range wars that developed as people surged west in establishing land to live off in America. Dempsey Rae (Kirk Douglas) is a cowboy who is drifting his way around the territories of the west. He befriends another lone cowboy, Jeffrey Jimson (William Campbell), when the latter gets thrown off a train they are both riding. They both go to work for range foreman Strap Davis (J.C. Flippen) who is himself employed by a pretty but ruthless landowner from the east, Reed Bowman (Jeanne Crain). Bowman is intent upon seizing as many cattle as she can together with land to graze them on. At the time, the country is just open prairie, but a few of the smaller landowners band together and try to keep a parcel of land for themselves to graze their few cattle. They do this by closing off the land with barbed wire. Much as Rae is attracted to Bowman, and much as he hates the use of barbed wire, encouraged by his girlfriend Idonee (Claire Trevor) he sides with the smaller cattlemen. A factor in his decision is also that Bowman has hired an old enemy, Steve Miles (Richard Boone) as a more ruthless foreman than Davis. It's an entertaining film, but it has nothing really noteworthy to commend it. It was directed by King Vidor.",1356134400,,1280,4.569565217391304

218400,4,6300183831,"A drifter (Kirk Douglas) hooks up with a young cowpoke (William Campbell, THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY) while riding the rails. When they both get hired as cattle ranch hands, trouble brews when the new and ruthless ranch owner (Jeanne Crain) decides to usurp the grazing lands for herself. This nifty western directed by King Vidor (DUEL IN THE SUN) is a superior effort that needs a wider audience to solidify its reputation. This was Vidor's first wide screen film and he was lucky to have that wizard Russell Metty (WRITTEN ON THE WIND) behind the camera. The film foreshadows the westerns that were to come (particularly in the 1960s) dealing with the transition of the Old West and how emerging civilization would change it forever. The casting of Crain, usually the sweet natured ingenue, as the hard and calculating ranch owner was inspired. With Claire Trevor, Richard Boone as the villain, Jay C. Flippen, Mara Corday, Sheb Wooley, Myrna Hansen, Jack Elam and Malcolm Atterbury.

The Umbrella DVD courtesy of Australia (it's not available in the U.S. at this time) is vivid wide screen transfer with an aspect ratio of 1.85 though it should have been closer to 2 to 1.",1321920000,2,1173,4.806930693069307

You don't need an all region player for this dvd

The movie is a great western. Kirk Douglas plays Demsey Rae,a man ""without a star"" that is without a goal or plan for life except to head further west away from encroaching civilization. He meets young Jeff Jimson ( William Campbell) who has just left home and takes him under his wing which Jeff really needs because both become involved in a range war. The local cattle baron, a woman Reed Bowman (Jeanne Crain) plans to drive the small ranchers off the range, stock it only with her cattle, and hires Texas gunman Steve Miles (Richard Boone) and his gang to do her dirty work. Demsey and Jeff start off working for her and Demsey and Reed are definitely attracted to each other. Demsey leaves though when he sees what is happening. Jeff stays and it looks like he and Demsey, who have become close like brothers, will have to have a show down.

There is nothing new in the plot but it is very well directed by King Vidor, Kirk Douglas is at his boisterous best and there is a great supporting cast. There is also some great tough action - this is after all a western. Like many westerns from the 1950s this also has mature complex characters that change and grow with the story. It just misses being a true classic like ""Shane"" or ""The Searchers"", but it is one I watch more often than the ""true classics"" Very recommended",1301875200,11,1688,4.495114006514658

Kirk has a particular aversion to barbed-wire fencing going up across previously free range, although he ends up helping ranchers to fence off grass for leaner times. Co-star William Campbell is awkward on-screen, which I'm sure was intended, but, his character seems out of place at times. The title refers to the Douglas character being given opportunities because of his skills as a cowhand and with his fista & gun, but, prefers to pursue an idea which won't tie him down, so, even when during the final scenes when he's offered on a plate the chance to settle on his own ranch with 200 head of cattle thrown in, he prefers to continue with his drifting lifestyle.
