8683334,3,B00OE1ABJG,"What  terrible dissapointment. What initially it promised a very effective thriller became a Russian salad. The light plot doesn't leave much for your imagination.

Delon is a hitman. And his character is much like Le samurai. Cold blood, lonely and straightforward. When he tries to retire from his job, is when the troubles begin. The rest runs for you. Not even the beauty and alluring beauty of Deneuve is capable to rescue such predictable plot.",1471132800,,450,4.986666666666666
