8256289,5,B0014TI0LM,"My partner started training with Sai when younger and really wanted to get back in to it, unfortunately we were unable to find classes in our city and so we searched for DVDs instead.

We came across Sensei Michael Hodge and after doing some background research, I was convinced this DVD would prove not only to be useful but worth the money.

Previous reviewers may say that Sensei Michael Hodge is young, but my experience of martial arts (my cousin reached 2nd dan black belt in karate before he was a teenager, won many tournaments and has many trophies) his age is not a negative factor at all, in fact, he is extremely talented and knowledgeable in his field of expertise.  As far as the price goes, what you are learning from this DVD, if you attended classes you would be paying a lot more!

For those of you who know nothing of the history of Sai and simply want to learn a new skill or something that will make you look flashy in front of friends, think again!  There is more to sai than looking like a cosplay character or Elektra!  Sai is a disciplined art form which takes great practice, patience and above all RESPECT!

Sensei Michael Hodge starts by explaining what size, shape and the different metals Sai come in.  You simply do not purchase any type of Sai, you need to know what size fits your arm and what metal is best for what you want to do with them.
Sensei Michael Hodge goes on to explain how to hold your Sai correctly - referred to as ""grips"" this is one of the most critical foundations, if you cannot hold your Sai correctly, you have no business progressing until you have mastered this, as there is a high chance you will end up hurting yourself or someone else around you, remember Sai are a weapon!

Punches/Flips/Blocks/Stabs/Slashes - Sensei Michael Hodge gives a demonstration first of all of how a punch/flip/block/stabs/slashes with Sai can be executed. This is done in a very controlled manner which allows the viewer to be able to watch his moves without missing anything and then breaks the moves down including the proper stances and form.
Sensei Michael Hodge then move on to show sequences, like before giving a demonstration of what you are about to learn and then breaks it all down at an easy to understand pace.

Overall I find The Beginner DVD to be very good, I like the pace in which it is set and the moves and techniques that are shown.  This DVD is perfect for the novice or for those like my partner who are wishing to return to the art form after many years of not training.

I would just like to say having used Sai myself and now training with Sensei Michael Hodge's DVD,  your hands and arms will ache to start off, but be patient and consistent, don't give up and most of all have fun!",1357862400,,2747,4.448207171314741
8256290,3,B0014TI0LM,Its basically the only one I found but a little pricey for what you get its a good product but learning from him you just get the feeling he's just a kid and not many strong motions its jus whatever considering its one of the only updated sai versions on the market.,1284249600,2,266,4.134615384615385
8256291,5,B0014TI0LM,I was given this DVD to learn to train with sais. It's a very non-complex and step-by-step DVD that will definitely help you learn how to use sais. Any beginners wanting to learn should buy this DVD!,1263427200,2,199,4.405405405405405
