5741876,2,B00CUDD0J8,"I've been a Wesley Snipes fan for a long time, going all the way back to 1989 when he portrayed Willie Mays Hayes in MAJOR LEAGUE.  Over the years, he's played a wide variety of characters, both good and bad; I've loved many of these, including Nino Brown from NEW JACK CITY, Simon Phoenix from DEMOLITION MAN, and Blade from the titular film trilogy.  Unfortunately, however, Snipes seems to have hit a very low point in his career, and his involvement with this recent film, GALLOWWALKERS, is a good example of that.  I wanted very badly to like this film, but a messy plot and bad writing kept me from it.

I am still a Wesley Snipes fan, although I hope his career does not take a nosedive like Val Kilmer's did several years ago.  Snipes' offscreen troubles with the IRS should not affect his Hollywood status, but his recent film roles seem to indicate otherwise.  Hopefully, a role in THE EXPENDABLES 3 will give his career a much needed boost.

GALLOWWALKERS started off with a lot of promise.  On the surface, the plot sounds interesting and could potentially make for an intensity-filled flick.  Also, having an action veteran like Snipes onboard makes it an even greater pull.  There's even the possibility for some excellent carnage in a film like this, which would thrust it into the annals of horror greatness.

Yet, the execution of the film falls way flat, and the result is a lackluster movie that is nothing more than a jumbled mess.  The storyline is convoluted and jumpy; I found myself rewinding several times to see if I had missed something.  Nothing is explained outright (you have to make A LOT of assumptions and many of those, for me, were wrong) and the confusion took me out of the film very quickly.

The acting in GALLOWWALKERS isn't bad, and the film has some decent gore, although there should have been much more.  I particularly like the use of, as my buddy, fellow-reviewer Hayes Hudson, put it, ""Mortal Kombat-like"" decapitations; these occur when Snipes yanks someone's head off and rips their spine out with it.  Likewise, the film itself is shot well and looks pretty good overall.  But those are the only positives I can mention.

GALLOWWALKERS is a big disappointment for me and I can't recommend giving this one a look, unless your fandom for Wesley Snipes can overlook the negatives I've mentioned above.  The film hits store shelves next week, if you want to take a chance on it.",1375228800,6,2424,4.6879432624113475
5741877,1,B00CUDD0J8,"you might like this movie if you enjoyed:
Blade 2 (2002)

Long Story Short:
Gallowwalkers are people who die and come back from the dead. Set in the wild west, where people's lives don't mean anything, Aman, a mysterious cowboy- gunman is seeking revenge on five Gallowwalkers who have raped his girlfriend.

Review:
I found the first ten minutes quite entertaining because it really caught my attention when they talked about a portal between heaven and hell and nuns who guard this portal. But then the story just falls apart, we don't really know what's going on or why things happen the way they do - well, besides Aman's revenge trip. And can we talk about those horrible wigs everyone was wearing?! I mean, I have a better looking synthetic wig at home than what they had to offer - don't ask. They seemed to have used all the budget for the few gore effects that were really nicely done, but besides that the movie doesn't have anything to offer. It's already bad that the story didn't make sense but what's worse is that I really didn't care if it did. I was just glad when the movie was over. This is another proof that many directors shouldn't be writers. It seemed well directed but the script was horrible. Gallowwalkers has apparently been finished a few years ago before Mr. Snipes even went to jail, but I guess they wanted to wait until he gets released, but they should have let it collect dust until the end of time if you ask me. My advice: If you watch the trailer you have basically seen the whole movie and saved 90 minutes of your life. Poor Wesley Snipes, but at least he has the opportunity to be part of the Expendables` Franchise, maybe this will give him the well-deserved comeback. I wish him well!

Snipes seems to only make these direct to DVD type movies now and they are usually all about the same quality. This one is a zombie-western that tried to be serious. The big problem with this movie is that it was just flat the whole way through. Nothing really exciting or interesting but on the other hand nothing to cheesy or offensive either. In terms of Snipe's movies this is one of the better ones but really only because it was so flat and boring nothing really stood out good or bad.

The movie certainly got more interesting. There was no lack of action, and the icky bugs, well, undead is sort of icky bugs. The gore factor came in right at the beginning. The language, was, of course, censored being on SyFy. I wish they didn't do that, but they have to pander to a wide audience and it is pseudo-network, so I guess they have to.

In the end, the movie turned out a lot better than I expected. Though there were a few vaguely familiar faces, when I actually saw the cast names, I didn't recognize a one of them except Snipes. Geez, I thought I had a better knowledge of obscure stars, but this gang was well off my radar. Didnt matter, because they did a pretty decent job.

5741899,3,B00CUDD0J8,"This is one of those Westerns made somewhere else and having a plot as tangled as any spaghetti Western.  I finally figured out when the scene faded to black and something completely different in over-exposure comes up, it was a flashback.  The two plots were intriguing enough (woman asked some Force (the Devil?) to resurrect her son and he complies with the stipulation that whomever the son kills will be resurrected also; Son hunts down the men who raped and impregnated his sweetheart (she dies in childbirth), kills them, then has to keep doing it again and again.)  The fact that the son of the gang leader killed himself out of apparent remorse and the father doesn't realize this and wonders why his son wasn't resurrected, too, could've made a good third subplot but it was barely pursued.

The characters have names in the cast list but no one calls anyone by name in the flim so it's difficult to know who's really who, except for Snipes, if course.  Some interesting scenery...dunes, dunes, and more dunes...it was filmed in Nambia.  The fights and killings are bloody, the villain speaks in a hoarse whispery growl and the first sight of him, skinned, waiting for a human flesh covering is good enough. Throw in a pyramidesque fortress in the desert, a group of women sworn to protect it, townspeople who look like albinos, and a sheriff who waylays people and hangs them to ""send them to their reward"" for extra confusion.

There are just too many questions and you have to supply your own answers which may or may not be the right ones.  Why did one of the Undead sew his lips together, then speak through the sutures? What's with the Cardinal-like robes the Undead wear?  What the heck does the names Gallowwalker have to do with anything? None of them are hanged though a good many others are. (A distracting point...in the gallows scene where the villain makes a rambling speech, one of the actors fidgets throughout the scene, not as if fear but more like she's tired of standing there and wishes the director would call ""Cut!"" I kept watching her instead of listening to the speech. A fine bit of upstaging, by the way.)

No explanation for the pseudo-religious connotation is explained. Is it allegory or just plain creepiness? This has been described as a future cult movie.  Perhaps so.  Unfortunately, in the hands of a a different screenwriter with a few deft explanations here and there might've made this into something really spectacular...a fabulous cult movie.",1399507200,,2492,4.783216783216783
5741900,1,B00CUDD0J8,"Gallowwalkers(Andrew Goth, 2012)

Yeah, I was one of those guys. Hallelujah, Wesley Snipes is... oh. Oh, my. On the other hand, worth noting: the IMDB trivia page for Gallowwalkers notes that the project was originally a Japanese offering starring Yun-fat Chow; one wonders if the disappointed fanboys, myself included, would be singing the movie's praises had it stayed that way. But thinking too far down those lines, well, that way lies madness (or, worse, a desire to bankroll something like the abomination that was Priest); we got what we got, and what we got is a ridiculous, shameless, incoherent dog's dinner of a film that makes me wonder why I am even seeing a headline in the related news section that says Gallowwalkers sells wide. Having now seen the wretched thing, but not having clicked to read the article, I can't help but wonder if the person who bought wide still has a job at VMI Worldwide. (Well, as of this writing, the movie has yet to open in Peru, so maybe it won't be a total loss.)

Aman (see what they did there?) (Blade's Wesley Snipes) is a cursed gunslinger in an alternate-universe American west. We find out early on he's after a gang of outlaws for some reason or other (the some reason becomes a mildly important plot point, therefore it's a spoiler). He keeps finding lackeys, but he's really looking for the gang's leader, Kansa (The Last Horror Movie's Kevin Howarth). Problem is, the gang are all undead. As such things happen (at least in the movies), Aman reluctantly acquires himself a sidekick in the form of Fabulos (Radio's Riley Smith), an eager young gunslinger who's just looking for some action. Well, he gets it. The end result feels like it was supposed to play out kind of like Django meets Blade...

...but instead it feels a lot more like Lust in the Dust meets Blade II (and I know there are some people who have some love for Blade II, and, well, I'm sorry for you). There was a great deal of talk back in the day about how this was going to be Wesley Snipes' comeback film. Now, I'm a Wesley Snipes fan from way back, and as a result I've seen a few of the films he's done since fading from the public eye, tripe like The Art of War and Liberty Stands Still and (ugh) Game of Death...and I'm here to tell you that every one of those movies is acres better than Gallowwalkers. This is just terrifying, but not in the sense that the movie is scaryit's a movie where it seems everything about it was simply the wrong decision. I mean, you make a movie where Yun-fat Chow was originally attached, Wesley Snipes stepped into the role, and there are no martial arts sequences whatsoever. How does that even happen?  And, okay, maybe I'm reading in the Blade-series similarities because of Snipes' involvement, but I don't think that's 100% of what I'm seeing here; Goth and Reay (who were responsible for the 2005 snoozer Cold and Dark previous to this) weren't wearing that particular heart too far away from their sleeves, to the point of giving Howarth a long blond wig (spike that thing out and with the mannerisms his character adopts, he might as well be Stephen Dorff). Now, I am willing to entertain the idea that when Goth and Reay put together the first draft of their script, it might well have been comprehensible. Maybe even good. Interesting characters who did interesting things and didn't simply exist in between action sequences (in other words, more Unforgivenanother movie this borrows from liberallyinstead of [fill in the Michael Bay movie here]). If that is the case, all the good stuff got fixed in post.

Only for the hardest of hardcore Wesley Snipes fanatics. And even then, as much as I never, ever thought I would say this: you might want to consider watching Game of Death instead. *",1399161600,,3765,4.638680659670165

Its much like a typical low-budget western movie set in the alternate Wild West, but the idea of Wesley Snipes fighting a bloody fight against a band of the undead is not bad.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not know how to tell a story on screen. For anyone who has not read the synopsis, the film would look like a collection of fragmented images that does not make any sense at all. You don't know who this Aman (played by Wesley Snipes) is. You don't know why he kills. Never mind, because anyway you stop caring.

Still, I couldn't help thinking the only thing worth watching is the beautifully-shot landscapes of the bleak desert (shot in Namibia), the backdrop against which the boring story goes on and on.",1395964800,,952,4.627218934911243

Snipes kills people that raped and killed his lover-but there is more to it than just that.  There is the back story of why Snipes character is...well...cursed.

Aman (Snipes), is apparently going around killing law enforcement and the gallowwalkers (the undead).  It takes a long time before Aman tells the story of why he wants revenge.  He was taken in by a mother who had a girl around the same age as him.  Later on this girl is raped by 5 men, one of which wants to teach his son to become a man.  The plot seemed very similar to the movie ""Priest"" with Paul Bettany, desert wasteland, a type of undead, revenge for a family attrocity, and taking someone under the wing to help kill.

If the visuals straight out of ""High Plains Drifter"" aren't enough for you, than the homage to the film ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" (Squeeky windmill, the ""you brought two too many horses"" line) is plenty clear. Then there's the whole plot-line lifted right out of the ""Man with no Name"" series and so are the characters; Snipes plays the Van Cleef character, bent on revenge for the rape of a loved one. Smith plays the Eastwood character, young, intelligent, recruited by Snipes to help him seek his revenge. Heck, even the rape flashbacks and the group of bad guys are plucked straight out of a Leone western. Where this film runs off the tracks for me was the whole undead aspect.

The concept of the movie or the mixture of genres here is fascinating; however, the movie lacks in plot development, not to mention corny B-Type-Movie special effects, I wanted to like this movie so much, because I really enjoy watching weird westerns, but this one did not do it for me. In addition, Snipes is boring as hell.  He should stick to playing bad guys.

This movie is like a combination of: Django-meets-Powerangers-meets-Mad Max 2-meets-Hellraiser-meets Predator-meets Interview with a Vampire.  I don't know what to think about such combination, it is as if Wes Craven met with Yodorowsky, Corbucci, Tarantino, and Lynch and directed this outrageous movie.",1387497600,,727,5.188034188034188

5741923,3,B00CUDD0J8,"""Gallowwalkers"" is the first movie Wesley Snipes released since the end of his prison sentence, after its production was slowed by his incarceration. It is also one very confounding film, though somewhat redeemed by its production values. In a way, it feels like Snipes was trying to revisit the kind of action-horror he had erected with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-trilogy/dp/B0007WFX62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade trilogy</a>, but this here is neither good action nor horror - just an interesting direct-to-video experiment.

The story: a gunslinger (Snipes), cursed so that the people he's killed will rise from the dead, engages a gang he murdered for raping his beloved.

I'll be honest: I have no real idea what's going on in the movie. At his worst, fellow action hero Steven Seagal's produced some DTV films wherein the motives of the characters are unclear, relationships are ambiguous, and the story is convoluted as heck, but he has never been in a movie as confusing as this one. You can glean that the main zombie-man (Kevin Howarth,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Horror-Movie/dp/B0002WZT7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Horror Movie</a>) simultaneously wants revenge on Snipes' character while trying to resurrect his staying-dead son, but that's about where it ends. About thirty minutes in, Wesley provides some exposition regarding his character, and with twenty minutes to go you glean that a showdown is going to happen, but that's it. I'm left with basic questions unanswered: ""what is this mysterious sisterhood they keep referencing?"" - ""why was Wesley's character cursed?"" - ""why does he think he needs a sidekick?"" - ""why does Tanit Phoenix (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race-2/dp/B0046BI81W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race 2</a>) have such a large role but does nothing throughout the film?""

The action is scarce and not very fulfilling, with the only real fight scene being a plodding encounter between Snipes and pro wrestler Diamond Dallas Page. Coupled with the incomprehensible plot, this should have been more than enough for me to rate this movie very low, so I'm surprised by how ultimately watchable the feature actually is. Director Andrew Goth seems to have thrown everything he had into this one's art direction and production values, and the results are some remarkably good cinematography and some great costumes and makeup. The look of the movie is unique -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-the-North-Star/dp/B0001US7MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of the North Star</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-of-Eli/dp/B002ZG997C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book of Eli</a>&nbsp;- and the acting tends to hold one's attention. Even the gore effects are sort of creative. I would completely understand if others didn't find these parts as compensatory as I did, but unlike during some of Snipes' other low budget fare, I was never bored while watching.

A second or third viewing might yet clear up those questions I have regarding the story, but I'm not sure I'll get to that - the movie's good but not great enough to merit repeat screenings. It's not the worst film that Wesley could have kicked off his comeback with, but it's good that he can fall back on ""The Expendables 3"" for now.",1386892800,,3517,6.113360323886639

5741927,2,B00CUDD0J8,"OK.. For those who don't know.  This movie was made BEFORE Mr. Snipes went to jail.  Thus, i think they depended on a lot of editing and flashbacks to try to make a story that would sell.

I am a HUGE Wesley Snipes fan, and was happy to see him back on the map.  Thus, upon seeing his beautiful profile on the cover of a DVD? I rented the movie.

But the movie doesn't seem to move forward at a steady pace at all, there's this constant ""piecing together"" by flash-backs to the point, the viewer is basically watching ""scenes"" or ""vignettes""..

A lot of it doesn't make sense - but it's great art.  Let's look at one scene of the movie where the slaughter-house kid is in a barren dessert -  and pouring the blood of an animal down into a well. It gets on his legs and shoes.  A startling, deep, rich, contrast against the dry, barren background of drab bleached sand/rocks.  Interesting as art.  Well, think about it.. why in the hell do they have a slaughter house - out in the middle of nowhere?  And where are do they raise the damn cattle?

Then the director starts to became quite repetitive with this theme.  In this scene there are a bunch of pale folks with pale hair (wigs), wearing pale clothes - you guessed it! Out in the middle of gawd knows where. Gathered together to hang some other people.  Folks get shot by skinless guy who just put on some chick's face after she was stabbed to death by his co-whore, i mean, co-hort..and out come the purple capes - contrasting against the barren landscape.

And yes the director makes good use of blood on sand and other contrasting material from beginning to the end.

Regardless of the director's ploy to keep the attention of the audience, or even try to make any sense of the movie at all.  The only redeeming factor of the movie?  Of course is seeing Wesley Snipes.  Whether he is bald or in dred-locks which look very sexy on him, BTW,  he can hold an audiences attention without saying one damn word.",1385596800,,1963,4.367403314917127

However, he has another agenda with Kansa..revenge. Aman enlists the help of Fabulos to fight by his side & even the odds.

I hate to admit it but, unlike the majority of the reviews on this film, I actually like Gallowwalkers. It reminded me of a spaghetti western of old that takes itself a little more seriously. I know there's alot of people out there who are going to draw comparisons between this film and Snipes' Blade trilogy but, all in all, there's very little to draw comarison to(Snipes hunting down the undead is pretty much it). It's a  decent film with a fair amount of action and, of course, Wesley Snipes stars with a supporting cast of Patrick Bergen, Tanit Phoenix, Riley Smith & Kevin Howarth. Wrestler Diamond Dallas Page also appears in the film.

Let's be honest, though, Gallowwalkers has one glaring flaw. That being the plot is all over the place. Twenty minutes into the film, I was-literally- trying to figure out just exactly what it was about. Course, it was resolved by the film's end...but, still, there's no excuse for leaving the viewer totally confused as to what's going on and where the film is headed.

This movie was made in Namibia but it looks like it was made cheaply in Death Valley like a lot of Hollywood movies are made when they want the desert scenes. This movie does not look like it has a big budget. The plot summaries from Wikipedia and IMDb are not in sync with the actual movie: ""When a nun broke her covenant with God to save the life of Aman, her unborn son, he was cursed for life. As an adult, Aman (Snipes) has killed those who have crossed him. But his curse brings his victims back to life, and as the undead, they pursue him endlessly for revenge. Forever suffering this curse, Aman enlists Fabulos (Smith), a young gunman, to fight by his side against his undead victims."" I kept waiting and waiting for the nun scene and when it finally happened, it made no sense!! The first 10 minutes of this movie are very good but then it all falls apart.

Aman enacts revenge on the group of men. However, in this region the dead come back to life (plot point loosely explained at beginning and end of film) and are known as ""gallowwalkers"" ignoring the fact the word is actually ""gallows."" Needless to say, the dead want to kill Aman as he hunts them down again. Aman recruits assistance in Kansa (Kevin Howarth).

The plain desert background provided for some great color contrasts, especially the reds, whites, and purples. This is not a zombie film per se, but there are living dead who walk, talk, and die similar to living people. There is graphic blood and body part scenes, but this is not a slasher or typical grindhouse. It takes place out west, but is clearly not a classical western.

The film is a hybrid. It combines aspects of multiple films and makes a production for a narrow audience. The flashback aspect, i.e. keeping the viewer hanging for thirty minutes as they try to figure out what is happening didn't work well.

I personally don't mind having to 'invest' myself a bit to try to figure out what's going on before a film more or less 'tells me', but this one is difficult to suss out in terms of specifics and questions of 'why'.  There is a moment where the Aman character (Snipes) launches into the backstory, but it is not effective and seems like it was 'tacked on' later to try to fix the lack of clarity in the film.  It seemed every time I thought 'okay, here is where the story is going and why it's going there' yet another turn would occur that did not really fit with what had been depicted thus far.

It was disappointing in the end.  I'd seen the ads for this movie on TV several times, just kind of catching the previews by accident and then ultimately I'd missed the actual viewing or recording of it each time for one reason or another.  That being said, what struck me from the previews is, in fact, the case with the actual film - the cinematography and some of the shots are absolutely stunning... not as surreal as you'd have with the dream/fantasy sequences in 'The Cell', but reminiscent of that in my opinion.

It is a shame, with a better script and less extraneous 'clutter' - seemingly to try to 'spice things up', this film might have really been something good.  It's almost like a food dish where someone kind of 'wings it' without a strong base recipe and after testing or sampling the taste of the  product keeps trying to 'add this or that' to make the dish better or 'save' it..... it just doesn't work.",1480896000,,1776,4.420245398773006

8586537,2,B00CUDD0J8,"I'll give it credit for some eye-candy cinematography, and the mish-mash storyline does start to come together, sort-of, if you stick with it to the end.  The story and script problems are just too much, though. Just picking some at random:  (a) too much screen time is spent on Snipes walking around looking cool, and not enough showing what motivates him.  (b) All the characters are just dropped in the middle of the desert with no reason for them to be there and no discernible relationship to each other, so all their interactions (such as they are) seem forced.  (This drop-em-in-from-nowhere can work if done right, e.g. ""Lost"" TV series.)  Those who are citing bad acting are, by my guess, really reacting to this problem with the script; the actors mostly do a capable job with what they were given and Howarth at points nearly channels Jack Nicholson. (c) Character motivations are inconsistent...if you are a murdering zombie, what is the point of a quick-draw scene instead of just shooting the guy when you see him? What was the point of Fabulos' trial-by-gunfight in the mine shaft? (d) Too much is left unexplained. An egregious example is when Fabulos protests that he won't go any further until he has answers.  There are about a million things Aman could have said here, enigmatic stuff to build dramatic tension, straight up exposition to help his accomplice (and the audience), philosophical stuff to create some depth of character, or a bickering argument to establish some sort of relationship between the two.  Instead we get nothing, just Snipes standing there looking tough-guy.  Arrgh.",1468195200,,1611,4.962825278810409
8586538,2,B00CUDD0J8,"This film is, to put it bluntly, a mess.

That doesn't make it bad per se - some films are just like that, and enjoyable to watch as well.

There's some great ideas bubbling beneath the surface here, but the execution will leave all but the most easily entertained viewers going 'Huh?  WTF did I just watch?'

Where do the risen villains get their Catholic Church clothes knockoffs?  Why do they wear them in the heat of the desert?  Why are a bunch of sheriffs dragging people out to the middle of nowhere to execute them?  What's up with this town of near-albino people who all wear earth-tone clothes?

And most importantly, where does Wesley Snipes' adopted mother sell her butchered animals?  Whatever she does it's amazing clean though, there's a lot of raw meat and blood left out, but nary a fly...

Skip this one.  It's not quite bad enough to be 'good, while drinking beer', and it hurts to see cool images and concepts thrown together in a blender to get cinematic hash.",1464220800,,981,4.548571428571429
