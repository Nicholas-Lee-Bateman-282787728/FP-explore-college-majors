8206443,2,B000SQL50U,"""Kung Fu Fighter"" is about as generic of a title as I can imagine, and the film itself isn't particularly distinguished. As a matter of fact, most of the time it's downright forgettable, thanks to a hodge-podge storyline and a questionable post-production design. Lead star Vanness Wu, once considered the next big star of Hong Kong cinema, is going to need some better vehicles if he hopes to keep up his reputation.

The story: set in the 1930s, a young man from the country (Wu,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kumite/dp/B000ION226/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kumite</a>) travels to a gangster-run Shanghai to find his father, and in the process joins the eccentric staff of a tea house.

For starters, the movie's video quality is awful. The English-only version from Tai Seng I picked up features such a muddy picture quality that looks like the film was made in the mid-80s (c'mon, guys - I know your DVDs are cheap, but do the first editions need to look like they already need remastering?). The dubbing is acceptable, ninety percent of the time. I was pleased to find a pleasantly rich supporting cast: Bruce Liang, Danny Chan, and Lam Tze Chung from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Hustle/dp/B0009S4IHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Hustle</a>, Kai Man Tin from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaolin-Soccer/dp/B000286RNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaolin Soccer</a>, and Siu Wong Fan from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ip-Man/dp/B003INBNXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ip Man</a>&nbsp;as an end villain and action director, but regardless of what most of these guys bring to the fight content, they can't help elevate the overwritten story. The movie transitions between two storylines - the one I mentioned above and the slightly less prominent one involving Danny Chan as a gangster lord. They do sort of collaborate, but either could have easily taken place without the other one. Unexpected scenes like the French musical numbers distract from plain weird ones like the rickshaw romance bit, but they can't distract me enough to overlook that some key plot points, like the superhuman strength of Vanness Wu's character, are poorly incorporated and not utilized enough to validate the importance placed on them.

The kung fu scenes save the movie...eventually. The first five encounters are merely average, even though they feature Vanness doing most of his own stunts and the tea house employees keeping things interesting by using a water can, a feather duster, and abaci as innovational weapons. There was nothing new or exciting to see, and thus I was about to give up on the movie...and then the final two brawls came about. The first is actually a collection of fights as a group of specialist thugs attack the tea house, resulting in a handful of truly entertaining, mostly grounded brawls (I wish most of these characters had names so I could look up who's playing them; I'd follow the braided fellow to other work he's done). The second is the showdown between Wu and Fan Siu Wong, who makes a truly memorable entrance by ripping his way out of a metal safe. This isn't the best exchange in the world but it keeps up the standard: I could do without the CGI add-ins, but I'd definitely like seeing Fan doing more fight choreography in the future.

Still, this isn't enough to save the movie, so unless you can rent it somewhere or are particularly enamored by Vanness, I wouldn't recommend seeing it. Interestingly enough, almost the entire main cast would reunite for the Sammo Hung picture&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Chefs/dp/B0030NLSNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Chefs</a>&nbsp;- I suggest you give that one a try before this mixed bag.",1335571200,,3921,5.790294627383016
8206444,3,B000SQL50U,this is a good movie... just didn't meet my expectation...I expected more fights to it and more story to it...sorry but I gotta give 3 stars only on this one...,1232323200,,160,4.366666666666666
8206445,5,B000SQL50U,"First off, I'd like to say that there is no ""Vannessa Wu."" It's a male by the name of Vanness Wu, who is the lead and also popular Taiwanese performance artist.

Kung Fu Fighter follows a lot of martial art conventions, while at the same time it starts to break out of them at many turns. As the lead, Vanness is charming and likable; I daresay he isn't unattractive either. The actual fight scenes are top-notch, and once or twice, you even have a slightly funny Jackie Chan-esque moment.

Even if you aren't a Vanness Wu fan, it's good if you just want a nice, clean, not-cheesy martial arts film with likable leads.",1207180800,6,618,4.460176991150442
