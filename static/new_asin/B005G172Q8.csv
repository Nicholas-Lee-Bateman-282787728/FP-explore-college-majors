4686823,5,B005G172Q8,"My husband and I both found this series to be surprisingly good. We have previously enjoyed the performances of Rupert Penry-Jones, particularly in MI5 and The 39 Steps, and so we thought to give Whitechapel:The Ripper Returns a try. However, there were a few trepidations on my part. As it is obviously about Jack the Ripper in some guise, I felt it would likely be predictable (after all, how many times have mystery novelists and film makers returned to this subject?), cliche-ridden, and just plain grisly. Admittedly, this is still pretty grisly in parts, but it is not predictable. Neither is it riddled with cliches. Rather like the outstanding new Sherlock Holmes series with Benedict Cumberbatch, Whitechapel: The Ripper Returns boasts a modern setting with innovative twists, a complex and intelligent plot, intriguing sub-plots and interesting characters.  It was fascinating to me to see how the various characters developed and interacted, buoyed by some fine acting.  All in all, a very good production.",1322352000,3,1017,5.233128834355829
4686824,5,B005G172Q8,"People have always been fascinated by the mystery of Jack the Ripper, and I'm no exception.

 When I visited London a few years ago, the first thing that I did was take the ""Jack the Ripper Walking Tour,"" and my recent book of short stories even contains a fictional account of the world's most infamous serial killer.

 Who was Jack the Ripper?

 Nobody knows and it's likely nobody will ever really know, though countless books and movies have speculated about the culprit's true identity.

 WHITECHAPEL: THE RIPPER RETURNS is the first season of a BBC television series, now on DVD, that is set in 2008 and takes a fresh look at the legendary murders.

 In this 3-episode thriller, a new serial killer is stalking the Whitechapel district of London and he's duplicating the more than one hundred years old Ripper murders down to the slightest detail.  Ambitious Detective Inspector Joseph Chandler (Rupert Penry-Jones), a homicide novice but an expert on police politics, is assigned to the case, much to the disappointment of veteran Detective Sergeant Miles (Phil Davis), who thinks the younger man is ""insane"" when he calls in a noted ""Ripperologist"" (Steve Pemberton) to consult on the case.

 Following the bloody path of the original Ripper, Chandler and his colleagues hope to stop the killer's modern counterpart before he strikes again.

 WHITECHAPEL: THE RIPPER RETURNS is a first-rate thriller that will keep viewers guessing right up until the surprising, satisfying climax.  The performances are excellent and it's my understanding that much of the series was shot on the actual locations where the original murders took place.

 The DVD from BBC Home Video includes a ""Making of"" featurette.

4686825,5,B005G172Q8,"Maybe if the tabloids back in the 1880s had dubbed him with a less evocative nickname, he may have sunk into dusty obscurity by now. ""Jack the Stabby Dude"" or ""Jack the Tickler"" or ""Jack the Bloke What Really Wanted to Make Sure."" He would've gotten laughed out of town then. Instead Jack the Ripper boasts one of them shivery sobriquets, and so his fearsome mystique only grows. This sucks particularly for modern day Detective Inspector Joseph Chandler (Rupert Penry-Jones), a well-connected, neat freaky, clotheshorse of a copper whose career is on the fast track. When he's assigned his first murder, the notion was that this was a simple domestic case in London's East End. Solve it, check it off the list, onwards and upwards for DI Chandler. He's never gotten his hands dirty before.

DI Chandler is given charge of the East End's homicide division, and what a slovenly, disagreeable crew this turns out to be. These detectives note Chandler's fastidiousness and expensive tailored suits and fast-track rep and the resentment brims over like a good hot cuppa. The vitriol doesn't come more vicious than from the unit's weathered, abrasive Detective Sergeant Ray Miles (Phil Davis). The tension only mounts when the police continue to be baffled. More corpses surface. Stabbed. Carved up. Mutilated.

I don't know what the percentage is, but an element of luck figures into any crime-solving, no matter how proficient the investigator. Luck saunters in in the shape of scholarly ""Ripperologist"" Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton) who promptly mentions the eerie parallels between the current rash of murders and what Jack the Ripper done so infamously in 1888. DI Chandler politely exhibits a raised eyebrow. DS Miles is even more direct in his scoffing. At first. But, soon after, it reluctantly dawns on the coppers that what they're facing is indeed a savage, devious copycat killer emulating Jack the Ripper's deeds detail for detail. It's pretty horrifying when history like this repeats itself. Jack the Ripper, remember, was never caught.

The modern police force versus an ancient villain straight out of urban legend. How can anyone pass this up? WHITECHAPEL's hook seems to be that of our trio of characters being pitted against criminals who've patterned themselves after notorious past killers. And I am down with that. I'm impressed with WHITECHAPEL, with its intelligent writing and staging of atmosphere that isn't quite paranormal but lapping on the shores of. The writers did a seamless job integrating Jack the Ripper's canonical murders into Chandler and company's contemporary investigations.

The two lead actors, Rupert Penry-Jones and Phil Davis, are rather brilliant, especially when in scenes together. Their uneasy relationship drives the plot as much as their ongoing case, the fish-out-of-water paper policeman and the battered, angry old bobby what's been forever in the trenches. There's a sense of gratification when DI Chandler - who only ever wanted this case as a stepping stone - begins to develop a taste for the chase. A warm glow suffuses at that moment near the end when Chandler's upper-crust boss informs him ruefully that he'll never rise above the rank of DI, but then take a peek at the expression on Chandler's mug as he reacts. I believe there's a contented smile. Solving the Jack the Ripper case will make a man out of any obsessive-compulsive wimp. Something which probably can't be said if the guy what done it is called Jack the Tickler. Or Jack the Stabby Dude.

The DVD's bonus feature consists of ""Peeling Back the Layers"" - the comprehensive Making Of featurette (00:29:05 minutes long).",1321920000,4,3645,5.109060402684563

4686827,4,B005G172Q8,"I have a great fondness for English film/television, and now the BBC America series 'Whitechapel,' which opens with a three-part mini-series about a Jack the Ripper copycat comes our way. It is a fascinating study of modern police work versus the real Jack the Ripper era.

We are introduced to straight-laced DI Joseph Chandler, played by Rupert Penry-Jones, a avorite from MI-5 days. He is an up and comer and hopes to move to the administrative end of the police world. He enters the 'old way of policing and detective work', and almost immediately he runs up against DS Ray Miles, played by Phil Davis. The slovely, disrespectful group of detectives are in the beginning phase of a case that resembles Jack the Ripper of old. They discount any and all information from a 'Ripperologist' played by Steve Pemberton. He is a fascinating character and plays a large part in these series. After some conflict between Chandler, and the other detectives, they check unsolved crimes and discover that, much like the Ripper, this copycat may have killed before.

The three shows seem very fast paced, and many of the clues and thought processes are forced on us, to digest and assimilate. The Ripperologist, fills in many gaps, and I felt on top of the facts of Jack the Ripper and his crimes. This was an historical lesson as well as a good police procedural. The series tells us of the six women who were killed, how, when and where. The continuity of Jack the Ripper gives this show a great base, and the mystery is filled with suspense. We come to know the detectives and some of their quirks. Their tendencies to disorganization does not stand them in good stead with their new DI, and as they get to know him, they show change. This is a male 'Prime Suspect' and is well worth your viewing.

Recommmended.  prisrob 11-02-11

4686828,5,B005G172Q8,"I have been a fan of Rupert Penry-Jones since watching his performance in Persuasion where he played the dashing Captain Frederick Wentworth. In Whitechapel though, Penry-Jones finds himself playing a very different role indeed. He is still dashing, and smartly-dressed in Savile Row suits, but his rank as a newly-minted DI on the fast track inadvertently places him on a case that turns out to be a serial murder mimicking the gruesome crimes of Jack the Ripper.

DI Joseph Chandler is being groomed for the HQ and as part of this training, is expected to pay his dues with a brief stint as a DI on a case that initially appears to be open and shut. The DI finds himself in unfamiliar territory and is looked upon with derision by the cynical DS Ray Miles (Phil Davis) and the other members of the team. The series is broken up into three episodes and each episode sees the team puzzling out the case which gets even more complicated when the team realizes that this is indeed a copycat killing of the Jack the Ripper murders, which means more victims will be targeted soon enough.

Over the course of the three episodes, DS Miles and the other team members come to a grudging acceptance of DI Chandler and even accord him some measure of respect especially when his hunches prove true. Chandler is also assisted during the course of the investigation by a self-avowed Ripperologist Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton) who prides himself on his vast knowledge about the Ripper murders and delights in the macabre Ripper tours he conducts in London's Whitechapel district.

The show's appeal partly lies in the plausible interweaving of the past events and the parallels with the present-day crimes. Then there's the all-consuming question of the modern Ripper's identity - will reading about the past crimes yield any clues at all about the present-day murderer's identity? There's a sense of suspense throughout and the viewer is left puzzling out the case along with Chandler and his team and trying to unmask the killer. The sense of menace is palpable throughout as viewers get a view of some of the gory details of the past crimes and present. Recommended for fans of atmospheric and suspenseful crime dramas.",1319155200,87,2212,4.8465608465608465

4686890,5,B005G172Q8,"The three-part series titled White Chapel: The Ripper Returns justifies more than the cursory post-screening comment generally dashed off after a quick look-see.  White Chapel is stylistically sophisticated in its revisiting of the Ripper's story and the modern-day copycat haunting the same territory in 2008 where the original predator murdered his victims in 1888.  The images are deeply layered and simultaneously evocative of both eras.

Interviews presented in Peeling Back the Layers with producer Marcus Wilson and executive producer Sally Woodward Gentile, director S. J. Clarkson, production designer Martyn John, and others on the production team make no reference to the key of the underlying logic establishing the noir style, which is quite simply in the way the hunter's mind works and subsequent method of seeking his prey to successkilling.  Nor is there but a mention of a ""hunting knife"" although plenty of visuals for blades: steak knives, scalpels, scissors, and the copycat's unsheathed weapon.

Detectives hunting the copycat use his same methods, stalking their prey from behind barriers and partitions, moving through doorways, upstairs and downstairs like large cats climb in and out of trees.  The maze of the city simulates the mind's labyrinthelevated trains and street traffic below zip back and forth as if sending signals to the city's cerebral cortex and brain stem demanding action.

The opening moment is a flash of the copycat.  Like animals with binocular vision, the film's hunter (with the viewer doubling his action) blink-sees, blinks again, adjusts focus, scans, adjusts again, and then zeros in on a target and lingers evaluating risk.  Motivated by opportunity, the hunter moves in to seize the moment.  Even foreshadowing his own death, his mind dwells on possible failure (sinking into the depths of the Thames from suicide).  The non-diegetic music in the opening sequence suggests his fall from the bridge tower to the icy darkness from whence he came and eventually returned at film's end.

The brilliance of the human mind is its gift of consciousness and introspection,  projecting and elaborating possible scenariosplanningto achieve.  And so I imagine the filmmakers constructed their film to work on many levels to satisfy different tastes for appreciating the distinctions they made obvious as well as those left subtle for viewers more willing to explore mysterious forests of the night and swim currents of complexity.

The noir effect is compellingly done with shadows, reflections, and even color coding to quantify the impact accompanied by the strident sounds and the wistful undercurrent of a longing composition from Ruth Barrett.  The aesthetic gestalt delivers its emotional power from this synergyin this case, quantity does deliver quality.  Two team members whose contributions overlooked in the interviews were editor Liana Del Giudice and director of photography Balazs Bolygo, and clearly the desired style was greatly enhanced by their expertise.  Editor Giudice joined the pieces Clarkson shot with an understanding of the aesthetic map just as DP Bolygo lit the shots throughout the map's terrain.  No mystery there, as one of the characters might say.

Truly the characters as written by Caroline Ip and Ben Court come to life through their portrayal by Rupert Penry-Jones (of Joseph Chandler), Phil Davis (Ray Miles), Steve Pemberton (Edward Buchan, the Ripperologist), Alex Jennings (Command Anderson, politician), and detectives George Rossi (McCormack), Christopher Fulford (Fitzgerald, the leak), Johnny Harris (Sanders), and Sam Stockman (Kent).  Paul Hickey's characterization of copycat Ripper Dr. David Cohen, flat and unemotional like the beige scrubs he wears for his final murder, pays off the emotional and visual contrapunality building from the detectives increasingly frenzy to catch him: two orchestrated linesthe back-forth and up-down counterpointconverging in the denouement.  [(Is this the same Paul Hickey credited with Sound Maintenance?  If so, you can give up your day job.) Yeah, some people actually read all the credits.]

Film is a composition of many elements and justifiably must always be thought of as such or the essence of its meaning is lost, at least, obscured.  That film (and its aesthetic cousins) is a cultural product must also bear weight in the discussion as the interviews revealed.  Several actors spoke about their revulsion to the Ripper's deeds and his reign of terror and their lack of awareness prior to production.  The education of the production team to the history told by the series expresses more about our present cultural knowledge and what is taught in schools, even in higher education, than can be written here.  Generally though the Ripper mythology is global knowledge.  Largely because of Jack the Ripper's crime spree, White Chapel's criminal culture was minimized and the East End became a location for corporate enterprise.

The infamy of Jack the Ripper in London's East End is disproportionate to the number of people killed, whereas the West End Ripper or Blackout Ripper of 1942 was far more prolific for the killing period but less well-known.  In fact today few have probably even heard of him.  Maybe because Scotland Yard detectives caught him.  Therefore, there are no theories to his identity or conspiracy theories growing in the dark.

To this day the Ripper's infamy in criminal culture inspires other killers to feats of unspeakable violence.  One notable case is that of the Jacksonville Ripper in Florida.  But the police caught him too.  Because people are more aware today through media programming about the spectrum of miscreants, citizens better able to identify deviant behavior, and police more willing to act in prevention of crime, not because of it, life for most is relatively free from fear.  In this sense, knowledge does make us free.",1376611200,,5907,5.352813852813853

Lots of theories that were posited in the original crimes are now redone for the modern ones. Red herrings galore! This was a lot of fun to watch and for those who are really into the original Jack the Ripper crimes and still trying to figure out whose theory is the closest; you will not be disappointed by this one. Found out that the BBC America channel carries this as a series called WhiteChapel. Wish I could subscribe to it!,1337212800,,811,4.523809523809524
4686941,4,B005G172Q8,"This is an average to good quality BBC production, set in London's presnt but based around the original Whitechapel murders of the 1880's [attributed to Jack the ripper].

It's essentially a copycat murder series, and presented in such a way as to be eminently believable.

There's precious few extras, as per norm for the BBC, but there really doesn't need to be.

Having the advantage of being filmed on location the quality of the sets doesn't get much better, the acting is above average and the storyline quite good.

It's a quality piece in so far as it proves an interesting show that also takes the viewer back in time to the original murders documentary style without actually breaking the quality and frame of the drama.

I'd recommend it if you enjoy the BBC's stuff, the subject or the area.

It was delivered quickly, in good condition and there were no issues with playability.",1337212800,,891,4.753246753246753
4686942,5,B005G172Q8,"Loved this DVD, in fact it was so compelling my husband and I sat up and watched all thee episodes. If you have enjoyed Sherlock and don't mind murder and intrigue then Whitechapel is well worth a look. Glad I brought it because we will watch in one again for sure.",1336348800,,265,4.215686274509804
4686943,5,B005G172Q8,"Wonderful dark and broody. Typical British Drama, loved it. I am from London so I understood the lingo and the locations, have watched it many times and still love it.",1336176000,,167,4.6
4686944,5,B005G172Q8,"I have to say that this is a very different kind of cop series,it is dark and very terrifying. Totally recommend this one.
Rupert Penry-Jones is brilliant. You must watch it.",1334534400,,174,4.645161290322581
4686945,5,B005G172Q8,"at first i was concerned--yet another writer using jack the ripper as his protagonist--but i was quite surprized and impressed with the take on the crimes. in this story, the killer is a modern day spree killer who decides to copy his crimes off the most famous unsolved case in london. at first, of course, the detectives didn't believe it was so--a crime happening in whitechapel doesn't mean it's connected to Jack the Ripper--but once they saw that it was in fact a copycat, they were on it. it was interesting to see how the killer would apply the particulars of the next murder in the series, seeing as how the detectives knew already when and where the crimes would happen. all in all, it left me wanting for more. i can't wait until the next season is released.",1330128000,,769,4.539568345323741
4686946,3,B005G172Q8,"I thought slow moving and the history presented in present day London. Maye i was used to how fast MI-5 moves, and the lead acotor who remains one of my favorites from the series seemed rather slow.",1328659200,,198,4.378378378378378
4686947,5,B005G172Q8,"Initially, an elite college man is selected to get his feet wet by working with regular college homicide detectives on one case; before this experience level can be checked off, and he moved up the ladder toward a cushy top administrative position. Unfortunately for all concerned, this one case turns out to be a highly astute Jack-the-Ripper copy cat.
The elite copper wants his detectives to wear ties and bathe so they will have professional credibility with the public (interviewing witnesses and experts). They tease him and give him a hard time, but slowly yield to his demands. After viewing the gruesome slaughtered bodies, the elite copper begins to have one all-pervasive need - find this sociopath before he murders again. He stays at his desk and goes out late at night combing White Chapel for clues. Eating, sleeping, bathing is nothing compared to stopping this fiend. The working detectives begin to see his degree of dedication (they had it from the beginning). They see him on their level as a team mate, and cooperation begins.
The case begins to madden all concerned from the higher ups who demand a quick solution (preferably non-messy), but the copy cat murderer is on his mission and will not be stopped.
The movie commences with ease over the traditional battle between the silver spoons and the stainless steels. About one-quarter through; you find yourself panting and sitting on the edge of your seat, as the tension bills. You find yourself in White Chapel looking over your shoulder and around the next corner. It is so dark....
A Ripperologist adds to the tension throughout the movie. There is nothing he does not know about the original Ripper.
Could he BE the Ripper?
No one knows who Jack number two is, or where he is... but you know he is close -  waiting to strike. Technology can't find him. The task force can't find him. He kills when he is supposed to kill, exactly where he is supposed to kill, and no one can stop him.
Than, Jack sends a detective one of his victim's kidneys. He ate the other half.
An intelligent movie which will keep everyone on the edge of their seat. The police couldn't catch him in the late 1800's and nothing has improved in the 21st century. If you loved the new SHERLOCK with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman - you will love White Chapel!",1327968000,2,2316,4.732673267326732
4686948,3,B005G172Q8,Rupert Penry-Jones from Spooks is what drew us to this series. Good production. For those interested in the history of Jack the Ripper it would be a good series to watch. Too gruesome however.,1327104000,2,192,4.676470588235294
4686949,5,B005G172Q8,"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT! MY WIFE AND I HAVE WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS, AND LOVE IT! The pacing is perfect. The plotting takes the time for you to learn more and more about the characters as the movie progresses. The acting is superb, and the historical data is very accurate! We love this movie. If you like a great mystery (and what greater mystery than Jack The Ripper!), then you will love this one. You get to see the actual murder sites, and try to solve who this modern day serial killer is, before he kills again. WHITECHAPEL: The Ripper Returns definitely deserves five stars!",1327017600,3,604,4.5
4686950,5,B005G172Q8,"Being an extreme fan of the acting of Rupert Perry-Jones in the series ""MI5"" and being extremely impressed with the acting of Phil Davis in Dickens' ""Bleak House"". I readily purchased this BBC Mini-series in three (3) parts on one (1) disc of ""White Chapel, the Ripper Returns"".

In this superbly written and directed ""Mystery"" the actors, named above, do not let me down with their ""acting skills"".  In fact, all of the acting in this ""mini-series"" is superb.  Rupert Perry-Jones is superb as the very sincere but  less than dashing hero, thought to be gay, whole grain eating new head of the White Chapel area of London detectives investigating team who has to ""prove himself"" to the ""higher up"" powers as well as the ""pavement beating"" ""everyday"" cops/detectives on the beat. The leader of this team is led by rough and almost cynical Phil Davis turning in a very fine performance as the not so easily ""taken in"" by this very green head of his department.  After all he and ""his"" detectives ""on the street"" have been doing very fine investigating crimes in the White Chapel area of London for years.

The case that Rupert has to ""prove himself"" in  ""White Chapel"" is a case  of trying to solve who is committing some horrendous murders of women that really appear as if Jack the Ripper has come back ""from the grave"" to do his nasty deeds again.

Believe me, I was kept ""on the edge of my chair"" until all was revealed--there are many suspects and many twists and turns in this Mystery.  ""White Chapel"" is some superb entertainment that I enjoyed very much.",1326844800,2,1560,4.64

8470925,2,B005G172Q8,"I wanted so much to like this 3 part show. I do love my BBC stuff. I did like the story very much and I did like the idea of the story and The brand new man in charge Detective Inspector played very well by Rupert Penny-Jones. I loved his change from the ""Posh"" new guy just waiting for his promotion to someone who really cared. The settings were wonderful and I enjoyed a few of the support cast too. Particularly, young Kent. So why only 2 stars??? Here it comes. The ""detectives"" working for the new DI are such clowns and children (Except the youngest, Kent) that I was so annoyed by their juvenile antics. The I know who did it mentality was annoying too. Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty. In particular the so-called detective played by Philip Davis was so aggravating that I only watched 2 of the 3 episodes. He was such an ass that I could not finish it or watch any other of this series.",1465430400,,914,4.319767441860465
