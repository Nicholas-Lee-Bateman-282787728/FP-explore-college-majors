Alpha home entertainment should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a movie without cleaning it up. All the sword and sandal movies should be treated with a lot more respect than these companies are doing. Is it asking too much for them to clean up the image quality? Why can't they digitally remaster these movies? I be willing to pay more if theywould spend a little bit more time to produce a movie with decent image quality. Sadly, only a few sword and sandal movies have ever been digitally remastered. If you have a soft spot in your heart for these movies, buy it but don't expect much in the form of image quality.",1492905600,,753,4.544117647058823
