Only problem is that our copy is getting old and rather than purchase it in VHS, we keep hoping it will go to DVD. Of course, it isn't a big blockbuster film so the odds of that happening is slim. But, hey, the way things are in the world now, anything is possible.
This is a rare gem of a film with great photography and everyone in the family can watch it. Join this dear old man on his search for Utopia in the Alaskan wilderness. Spoiler: No many how many times I watch this film, the ending still touches me very deeply. You feel as if you are there with him in his shock and disappointment.
Wonderful film!! Everyone should see it at least once.",1382918400,2,729,4.069444444444445
532125,5,6302981654,"Things that we treasure are frequently things that are rare.  That this movie is so hard to find and also that it is not available on DVD is really pretty strange. A slice of life in the Alaskan bush that feels like a documentary (which I suppose in some ways it is) and an exciting adventure story at the same time, Sourdough should have a broader audience.  It is one of my favorites and one of the best of its genre.  SAVE SOURDOUGH!!!",1099267200,9,438,4.253012048192771
532126,5,6302981654,"Viewers of this tape will experience one mans true life struggles with the tough and unforgiving Alaskan wilderness. A story written by the old timers brother see's sourdough and his two canine companions ultimatly set out for an epic journey to find an untouched home in the wilderness were man and machine have not left their marks on the world, the old man turned his back on the ways of progress long ago and like some, at the slightest hint of change or unwelcome intrusion into his world by strangers he would rather gamble his life on heading further into the Alaskan wilderness rather than accepting the world as it threatens to envelope him. I remember seeing this movie when I was a child and searched for it most of my adult life, to me this film fulfills the dreamer inside me of the boy that wanted to hunt, build a log cabin and mix it up with the wild frontier. Sourdough himself is a genuine bushman and his story contains true to life elements of his life as a fur trapper and gold prospector, added to this is a dire story of him seeking a rufuge that may as well be on the dark side of the moon. The ending of this movie is very sad for Sourdough as he has to face up to the realities of the 20th century and reluctantly accepts defeat to it. I would highly recommend this movie to those who love the wilderness and enjoy seeing an old pioneer scratch out survival hunting a moose, looking for gold and set a trap or two for fox and beaver. As he mushes his team of huskies through the -35* winters in the film you get a real appreciation and understanding of how hard a life old Sourdough had or perhaps by his own philosophies and the tapes footage how good a life he really had.",1080000000,10,1700,4.299065420560748
7833826,5,6302981654,"One of the most meaningful movies produced and my favorite movie of all time.

You will be stunned by the grandeur, beauty, and simple lessons of nature in this rare movie. I have seen it numerous times (and keep a VHS machine just for this movie), and it moves me every time. If you have ever longed for a simpler life, true friendship, appreciation of nature (in its natural state), this movie may affect you as well.

Minimal dialogue, exceptional story-line, genuinely moving subplots, real characters (who you believe you know despite a character sketch maybe five lines long), beautiful scenery, nature (but not schmarmy nature, raw nature), and a simple quest for peace and quiet among a noisy world. EXCEPTIONAL!

I first saw this movie by rental at a local public library. I __never__ cry at a movie; I cried during this movie (Iin a good way)--it is that well done--and still get choked up every time I watch it. Not for everyone but if you appreciate exceptional movies and nature, you will likely be moved. Worth every penny.",1519344000,,1037,4.75
7833827,5,6302981654,"I really wish this movie would come out on something newer than VHS.  I have watched my copy until it's ragged.  I have been wondering if I should get a backup in case it falls apart entirely.  Even considering the price it would cost to buy an old VHS copy of this movie, I am still considering it, because it is that good.  Sourdough is the story of a man who gets entirely fed up with how society and the world is going and decides to divorce himself entirely from it.  He moves himself to Alaska to live a simpler, less hectic life.  The story plays out almost silently, there isn't a lot of talking, just observing what it takes for this man to make it entirely on his own. It's truly an awe inspiring adventure and certainly not one to take lightly.  Just surviving the harsh terrain, forging rivers and avoiding wildlife would be a feat on it's own, but even more so because it's being filmed, something that you almost forget as the story goes along.  It feels more like a documentary than a movie.  The landscape they film in is beautiful.  When his hard work is ruined by a bear getting into the bear cache you feel upset as he does.  When his dog gets washed downriver, you cry.  It's a very powerful movie and is so until the very end.  This movie is much deeper than it seems on the surface.  What it shows us about life and the enduring human spirit amid modern chaos could use a wider audience.",1519084800,,1409,4.287878787878788
7833828,5,6302981654,"I know part of the family, a son that helped film this movie, and it is an excellent preview way of life of the good old days. I can say that, because I have lived that type of life in the early 1950's. I was 7 years old and I have very vivid memory of what that kind of life was like. I have viewed this film many times and it is dear to my heart. I show it to all our friends when we visit friends in the south 48 states. There several versions of this movie with different voices and editing to appease the animal activists, but I have viewed the original version because one of the sons said so.
The thing that I abhor is that the years that this father and his sons spent making this film they never realized one red cent from it!  Sad, but true, when the Hollywood, who ever, edited the 16 mm film master stole it and the rights.......Thus the family never got a dime!!!
I am a videographer myself and have done work for one of the sons. I also, have my own film of my life in Alaska part 1, and working on part 2.
( see me at alaskavideoproductions.com) Never the less this movie is the very best film I have ever seen that truly depict life in its raw form of early Alaska.",1471910400,,1181,4.004237288135593

7833830,5,6302981654,"If you like the wilderness and Alaska and the ""Alone in the Wilderness"" type adventures, then you will love this 45 yr old film by Rod Perry. This was his first film and his father played the ol Sourdough. Full of real adventure and scenery, but also a poetic side to this tale.  It is a shame no digital copy of this film has been released and probably never will.",1453852800,,365,4.214285714285714

7833833,5,6302981654,"I watched this movie soon after we moved to Alaska with the Air Force.
It was so fantastic that I thought it was made for tourists.
I finally found an old VHS copy that was so washed out that I almost cried... but I watched it anyway and other than the lack of vibrantly true color, it was still the classic tale of one maman's attempt to escape the intrusive encroachment of civilization...A true Alaska story.
Please bring this back if you can ( hopefully the right person will see this )",1424995200,,490,4.336956521739131
