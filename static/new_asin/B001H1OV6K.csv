8307647,3,B001H1OV6K,"If you're a fan of Mamady, or of African drumming, this is a must-have cd. Mamady and his group Sewa Kan are fantastic in this performace. You will rarely hear a musical group as tight as they are! Unfortunately, the dvd is marred by very poor production values. There are several instances where the sound is muddy, and the overall quality seems amateurish, as if this is something that was hastily thrown together. Hopefully, there will someday be a video of a Mamady/Sewa Kan performance that is of as high a quality as the musicianship.",1242259200,,540,4.6947368421052635
