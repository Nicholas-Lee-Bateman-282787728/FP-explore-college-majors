1707257,1,B000065PXQ,"The principal review states Louis XIV's mother was a Medici.  Louis XIV's mother was Anne of Austria (married to Louis XIII).  She was a Spanish Hapsburg, not a Medici.  His wife was Marie-Thrse, also a Spanish Hapsburg and niece to Anne of Austria.  Henri IV was married to Marie de Medici (Louis' grandmother and mother to Louis XIII) and Catherine de Medici's was Henri II's wife (mother of 3 kings, and mother-in-law for a time of Henri IV).

1707258,4,B000065PXQ,"I purchased this DVD after seeing a preview featured on another DVD. I was fascinated by the quality of the production and the shear extravagance of the sets and costumes. How much of the story is factual I don't know; probably very little. How much interaction there was between Louis XIV, Lully and Molire can only be guessed. However, treated as fiction this film is a wondrous tale of  how a working-class musician (Lully) gets involved with the King of France and will do almost anything to keep in his good graces

Having visited the Palace of Versailles myself, I was a little disappointed that the only views of the completed building are of the Galerie des Glaces as the principal performers walk into the credits at the very end of the movie.",1243900800,6,752,4.646616541353383
1707259,2,B000065PXQ,"We previously got the sound track, which was wonderful.

We were hoping to see some dancing, but there was very little and very strange. We got to see some acrobatic exhibition dance, but none of the french court dance, which everyone at the court was expected to do well.

It's impossible to believe that people would behave in such a frantic and out of control manner in the French court. No manner how talented they were.

There are many unbelievable things. For example, female singing roles were still played by young men with high voices. Didn't the director remember the movie Farinelli, which he himself directed?

Very disappointing, and we had such high hopes.",1226966400,5,670,4.850877192982456
1707260,4,B000065PXQ,"Louis XIV was the most capable monarch of his, or perhaps any, generation. The artistic grandeur of his court is legendary.  The film, like most about La Grand Monarch, is rather simplistic. However the performances, musically and dramatically, are well worth the viewing.  Do not bother with the English dubbed version.  The original French is best.  Just remember that Lully was only one in a thousand important relationships Louis had in his 70+ years on the throne.",1214784000,10,469,5.0519480519480515
1707261,3,B000065PXQ,"In order to understand the movie, one has to be quite familiar with French history, especially during the reign of Louis XIV, including the background information on Lully, Robert Cambert, Moliere, Prince de Conti; otherwise, the plot and conversation could be very confusing.  One of my biggest problems with this movie is that many characters were cast TOO OLD!  Cambert (1628-1677) was only 4 years older than Lully (1632-1687), and yet the actor who played Cambert looks old enough to be the father of Boris Terral (who played Lully) and actually was already 50 year old when the film was shot!  The actor who played ""Prince de Conti"" was already 56 while his character should be a twentyish or thirtyish young man!  Same with Moliere.  Couldn't the director find some younger French-speaking acotrs?

But if you like French Baroque music and court dance, then this movie might be for you.",1149984000,31,893,4.92
1707262,5,B000065PXQ,Buy the Sound Track CD as well. It may be the best music of the Middle Baroque period you ever known. and see how a dish washer......dancer...... become the KING's top composer in 17th century France.,1143504000,5,200,4.583333333333333
1707263,4,B000065PXQ,"It is pity, many fine French films are out of order. You may get from used seller though.

I have seen some paintings or drawings Louis XIV danses ballet. The Ballet scenes in this film reminded me those pictures.

Most of music is by Lully, A father of French Opera, that is gourgeous. I had never listen to Lully's music before but they interest me then I bought a CD.

The story is about a life of Jean-Baptist Lully with Louis XIV and Moliere,and basically followed with the fact in the history. Lully composes music for his master, Louis XIV who is a lack of power in early period. Louis danses with Lully's music. Louis takes a charge and power as a king after the death of the premier Mazarin. His idea conflicts often with his mother and Church. Louis uses power of art as the power of France. Louis orders Moliere and Lully work together and they build up comedy-ballet genre and releases some masterpieces such as ""Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme"". Louis is unpreased Lully's bisexuality and some scandals with young boys but also Louis admits Lully's outstanding music talent. Because Lully hasn't  been satisfied with working under, he is feeling, Moliere, then finally he excludes him from the court. Lully got old, injures his leg during the concert. He refuses to have his leg cut then dies. Louis didn't show up dying Lully.

In this film, the story put focus on Lully's feeling love to his master which is never completed. It looks like he admires his master so deeply that his feeling becomes love. And the master, Louis XIV acted by Benoit Magimel, is detached as a king. ""I don't have any friends"" says Louis XIV.

According to some history articles, Lully is a composer who gets the most from his master. And Lully is considered Louis's personal friend. So I guess their relationship was not like in the film.

The most facinating aspects in the film is, I think, music, ballet scene, custume, and arts. Each cut is as beautiful as a paintings in the museum.",1143417600,22,1972,4.63323782234957

7961114,2,B000065PXQ,"A lavish, gaudily financed production + opulent costumes + exotic surroundings that leave us ga-ga and complaisant.  A handsome, near naked youth sprayed from head to toe in gold body paint rises to stage level on a rising platform.  Makeshift connecting scenes and a jerry built plot follow.  It's opening night at Las Vegas, right?  Nope, but it's an understandable mistake.

Like its predecessor FARINELLI, this film uses music as a stalking horse for sensationalism and naughty topics.  The confusing plot, based on court rivalries about which we care nothing, is the vehicle to which debauches, intrigues, a murder and various pseudo-crises attach like barnacles.  The viewer may be excused for confusing these goings-on with excesses in the times of Nero, rather than a provincial, pre-Versailles French court.

A more devastating fault for me is the evidence that cinematic imagination and intelligence are out to lunch.  Cliches abound.  ///(***) The king makes a series of unexpected announcements.  The various factions exchange repeated, anxious looks among themselves.  ///  (***)  The king's mother, excluded from policy making, is dying.  The king races pell mell down multiple staircases (round and round and round, shot from above) and bursts into the room.  The entourage around the bed is shooed out.  Cliched remarks are exchanged about motherly coldness, there's a riposte about Louis's neglect of his filial affections, and a bit of final advice about the need to look after the realm.  She dies, he retreats to a hallway and sobs.  It's hackneyed yawn-material in a cardboard presentation and has zero effect on plot developments.  No director with cinema savvy, as opposed to staging Las  Vegas extravaganzas, would consider clunking up the screen with this  sludge.  ///(***)- moving on, count the number of times the camera shot begins with people backed up flush against the lens and  then rushing straight  ahead down a narrow corridor, with  the camera following 20 feet behind.  Not to mention pointless and recurring close  ups that add nothing.  Another camera gambit  is to have the king repeatedly striding through crowded rooms with all that bowing  going on.  This, too, can't be repeated often enough and is tailor made to close a scene.

The script saddles us with relationships that are undeveloped and go nowhere.  Lully awakens from a debauch covered with blood. He's naked and a naked page with his throat cut is lying on top of him.  He tears home and blurts out everything to his wife who  vows to stand behind him forever.  ""You have become my whole world.""  We're not allowed to know why she feels this way.  Why is she brought onscreen here?  She  has no influence at court.  Her support counts for  zero.  We never learn anything more about  her.  She's just the means to close the scene and get things underway again.  When  Lully starts to inform the king of the murder,  the king holds up a hand and says ""I don't want to hear about it.""  Naturally, a king shrugs off a naked sex/murder scandal --- oh,  bien sur!  All is permitted to his composer in residence, get it?  And it planes out knots in the plot flow, get it?

On the whole, this is hasty, contrived, make-do cinema, oblivious to the requirements of the craft.  The director is gambling that opulence, glitz and stabs of Lully's music will conceal this from us and he'll get away with a cinematic version of the old shell game.

Spectacle in confined spaces and lavish production values are on hand.  But is there mature cinematic direction and intelligence to support them?  No way!",1342915200,5,3594,4.924623115577889
7961115,2,B000065PXQ,"Another reviewer was mistaken when he wrote, ""In order to understand the movie, one has to be quite familiar with French history ...."" While it wouldn't hurt to know everybody's back story, it is NOT essential to appreciating this movie. Before I watched it, I had never heard of Lully or Cambert or Anne of Austria; I had heard of Molire and Conti but knew nothing about them except their names; but I had no trouble at all following the movie and enjoying it as much as I could with its substantial flaws.

The same reviewer complained that the actors playing Molire, Conti and Cambert were much too old, that all three were closer to Louis' age. What bothered me more than the wrong ages of some of the supporting characters was the fabulous gorgeousness of the actors who played Louis and Lully. Please! There are good portraits of both men, and both of them were as homely as my aunt Gertrude - especially Louis.

That a man who looked like a gargoyle dwarf (he was only a few inches over five feet tall), saddled at the age of four with a bankrupt, strife-torn, second-rate country, transformed himself into the Sun King and his country into a major world power, and by the force of his will completely dominated Western civilization for nearly a century - and STILL, more than 300 years later, and despite the horrific revolution that destroyed the world he created, is the single most significant person in the history of France (only Napoleon comes close, and he was a flash in the pan compared to Louis) - is a big part of what makes him so extraordinary. If he had looked like Benot Magimel, what would be the big deal? Gorgeous people automatically control the world; they don't have to DO anything. Louis is fascinating because he was NOT gorgeous, and making him gorgeous wipes out 75% of what makes him interesting.

The answer to both that reviewer's and my beefs with this movie is that its makers had no intention of making an historically accurate quasi-documentary about this fascinating man and the almost equally fascinating people around him. They intended to make an overblown, potboiler soap opera based loosely on real people. They made the principals gorgeous because who cares what happens to ugly people? They made the villains grotesque and old because if they had been young we might not have known they were the villains.

This is a French movie, but it might as well have been made in Hollywood. It is cheap (and I'm not talking about money) melodrama, with gorgeous, dashing heroes and old, ugly, hunched-over, troll-like villains with grotesque birthmarks on their faces. It was NOT made for experts in French history or any other persons of intelligence and discernment.

It was made for an audience that neither knows nor cares how accurate it is or who the people in it are. That's how Hollywood does everything, by formula - the same formula they used in silent westerns, where you knew the good from the bad guys by the color of their hats - so audiences don't have to think, don't have to understand anything. They know by their looks which characters to cheer and which ones to boo, and that's all that matters.",1337817600,5,3153,4.684115523465704
7961116,5,B000065PXQ,"If you like baroque, appreciate art & ballet, you will probably like this movie.  It is not a love story.  I wish it was.  But it tells the story about the Jean-Baptiste Lully & his friendship with Louis XIV.  The visuals are stunning & the music is powerful.  I wish there was more ballet.  I wish Moliere was younger.

The music and dancing were great. There were plenty of good looking shots of the court and landscape. The story line plodded along.  I only felt an emotional attachment to these characters:  Lully's wife and Moliere;  I don't know if it was intentional on the part of the script or direction, but all the other characters/actors left me  cold.",1322784000,2,611,4.8076923076923075
