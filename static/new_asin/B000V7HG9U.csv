8217137,1,B000V7HG9U,"This is the second time I have purchased this DVD. The first one stops and does NOT finish, not long into it. I thought maybe it was scratched or there was something wrong with it. I purchased the second one and the same thing happened. NOT happy at all. This is the only one I've had trouble with. Mind you, I've only bought three different ones.
Will not make this a third mistake. My kids and I are very disappointed.",1378512000,,420,4.2625
