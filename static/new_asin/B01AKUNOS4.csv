8747706,4,B01AKUNOS4,I'm giving it four stars because it's a fun movie from my youth -- but please note that it is CUT. It's missing several shots I remember from seeing on TV as a kid - some of which have been posted by someone on eBay. That really sucks. But otherwise the DVD looks great.,1529452800,,270,4.018518518518518
8747707,3,B01AKUNOS4,"Two years before THE GIRL FROM RIO, Shirley Eaton (GOLDFINGER) also starred as Sumuru, a beautiful but deadly woman with plans for world domination. When a couple of wise-cracking, swingin' secret agents uncover her scheme to eliminate male leaders and replace them with sexy undercover female operatives, they rush to Hong Kong and enlist the local police to stop her all-female army of assassins known as THE MILLION EYES OF SUMURU. This is the bvery kind description that you have been given.....don't believe it. I would actually go 2.3 for this movie, pure dreck. Cheap even for it's time and the acting is way too over the top...was it meant to be? I don't know but it didn't work at all for me if it was supposed to be tongue in cheek. The hero was less than heroic and I did enjoy Frankie Avalon. Not much else impressed me or entertained at all, I was seriously bored. MY recommendation.....skip it.",1526169600,,908,4.68125
8747708,5,B01AKUNOS4,"Entertaining mid-to-late-60's British-made spy spoof.  A pair of American agents, played by George Nader and Frankie Avalon run afoul of a secret society of women intent on controlling the world.  The leader of the society is played by Shirley Eaton with sexy iciness. Klaus Kinski is great in a small role as a flaky, sex-crazy potentate.  Filmed in the Far East. Another film with the same character of Su-Muru, filmed around the same time, is called The Girl from Rio.  The DVD is excellent quality and the color is lovely.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1515283200,3,562,4.8125

8747712,5,B01AKUNOS4,"The Million Eyes Of Sumuru was released in 1967. Starring George Nader in this wild Euro Spy B- film, with crazy female terrorists trying to dominate the world. Frankie Avalon is along for support. George Nader being lashed has to be seen to be believed. Fans of George Nader will like this the most.",1465516800,4,300,4.574074074074074
