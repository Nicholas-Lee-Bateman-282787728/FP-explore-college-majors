3952436,5,B002MRRRAA,"I'm a huge fan of metal music but always loved Nirvana. This dvd is for those fans of all time. I just fell into tears when watching this dvd. The passion, originality, energy and so on of this band will stand forever as an example for all the other bands and the music industry itself. So sad to see Kurt so close, in front of you and realizing you won't ever have the chance to see them alive again. But this DVD is the chance to go as close as you can to that dream...Beautiful.",1260403200,,481,4.073684210526316
3952437,5,B002MRRRAA,"This DVD is incredible! I wasn't lucky enough to see Nirvana play live, but this DVD is the next best thing. From start to finish this concert is amazing! The camera work is great-not like a lot of the other sub-standard footage out there.  The songs sound like what you would expect at a live show. The audio is clear (for those able to follow Kurt's sometimes mumbled lyrics). This DVD (and the Live at Reading CD) are sure to please any Nirvana fan. It definitely pleased this one!  : )",1260144000,2,489,4.362637362637362
3952438,3,B002MRRRAA,"Dave & Krist are great here as always. Both clearly smiling and enjoying playing the show. Kurt on the other hand plays like he'd rather be anywhere but on a stage. He's unusually sloppy and boring on the guitar and his singing lacks enthusiasm. Strange show to release on DVD when there are great shows like MTV's Live & Loud available where not only Kurt was set to ON for the night, but the entire band was amazing. Comparing the band playing this show in 1992 and the band playing Live & Loud in 1993 is fun to do. Is it even the same band? Were the members upgraded scientifically to be more awesome? They look healthier and happier, too, in the 93 show with Pat Smear. ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter"" alone from that performances makes anything on this Reading show seem like stuff you'd hear from a local garage band ... in their garage. The DVD is good to see Krist having a great time, I always get a kick out of that. He knew how to enjoy each show just to be up there playing songs he liked. Check out the burst of enthusiasm when he turns on the distortion on his bass during the ""D7"" cover. If it weren't for Krist always jumping around, and the interpretive dancer here, Nirvana would've been a boring band to watch most of the time, since Kurt only moves around when he's not singing, and even then he often looks self-consciously zombie-like in his movements, except when he's throwing himself around lost in the music.",1258502400,8,1433,4.431818181818182
3952439,5,B002MRRRAA,I loved the MTV Unplugged performance and this is a great show with the normal amplified format....or Nirvana at FULL POWER !!! A must have for your collection if your a fan !!!,1257811200,7,177,4.393939393939394
3952440,5,B002MRRRAA,"In a word - amazing! Live At Reading serves as a vibrant reminder as to why Nirvana belongs in the pantheon of great rock bands, and how they may likely be the last great and meaningful band to emerge in the past twenty years. Live At Reading captures the band at a crossroads - just a year before in 1991, the band played the very same festival, but was relegated to an afternoon performance somewhere in the middle of the multi-day, multi-band gathering. Just a year later, they would be arriving as conquering anti-heroes, having in the space of a year, accomplished the small feat of changing the face of music. Now the festivals headliners, Nirvana - and particularly Kurt Cobain, had become the subject of much public attention, and amidst a cloud of rumours and innuendo stirred up by the press, the appearance was as much anticipated for the spectacle as it was for the expected performance, a performance that would be the bands final in the U.K. What is captured on tape, hardly comes across as a band in its final moments - Live At Reading explodes with ferocity and moments of sheer brilliance. Granted it has its less than sparkling moments, but those are few and far between, and seem more a by-product of a band at odds with its own success, and adding verity to event.

The moments where Nirvana truly shine are too many to mention - the performance of ""School"" displays the skills and sound which made Dave Grohl such a key addition to the band. His drumming matches the visceral attack of Kurt's vocals, turning the performance into a thundering pummel that churns the crowd into a sea of screaming bodies. Other highlights include blistering performances of tracks from Nevermind, including ""Breed,"" and ""Lithium,"" the latter of which induces the crowd into a most memorable sing-a-long segment, serving to illustrate both the bands immense popularity at the time, and the potency of its songs.

Other highlights include those from the then forthcoming In Utero album, including the first ever performance of ""Tourette's"" and the soon to become classic ""All Apologies.""

On the technical side, the 5.1 Surround mix mastering done by Bob Ludwig is nothing short of incredible. Having been fortunate enough to work from the original multi-track masters, the sound freed from those tapes is a revelation, and reason enough for any lagging fans still listening in simple stereo, to make the leap to a surround system.  The picture quality is also a quantum leap forward, having owned a bootleg copy for years, the improvement is clearly visible. Live At Reading is a must have for any Nirvana fan, casual or core.",1257206400,35,2628,4.833333333333333

3952453,4,B002MRRRAA,"I am not the demographic typical of Nirvana's fans, as I am 73, but as a fan of rock through the ages, I occasionally have found
a more recent rock group or star worthy of seeing and/or hearing.  Nirvana is definitely in that category.  There are not many
dvd's available for them, since their run was sadly ended too soon.  This collection covers most of their greatest songs, but
doesn't include ""Heart Shaped Box"", one of my favorites.  Cobain's style was indeed unique.  He managed to make musical
combinations normally considered discordant sound melodic.  Overall a good watch and not many other options if you want to
see as well as hear him in concert.  More exciting than ""unplugged"", since much of the material is more familiar to Nirvana fans.
(Though unplugged is good too).",1399507200,2,786,4.777777777777778
3952454,4,B002MRRRAA,"I was pretty excited about this dvd when I ordered it, and for the most part it did not disappoint. I'm a huge Nirvana fan and we all know that Nirvana's live shows can be rough, and there were certainly moments in this dvd where I cringed. What immediately comes to mind is Love Buzz, In Bloom and a few of the solos. Just keep in mind that Kurt's gift was songwriting not lead guitar. I would suggest this dvd to all Nirvana fans, but I'm curious to see Live and Loud because from what I remember the songs seemed more polished and the band seemed to play tighter at that gig. I'd like to see the dvd because the vhs I have is all worn out and the sound is bad.",1395446400,2,663,4.03030303030303
3952455,5,B002MRRRAA,"This is it. This is a bona fide Nirvana concert caught on film. Note, this is not widescreen. That will be a bit jarring at first since we are all used to widescreen everything.

The concert, itself, is loud, gritty, and so full of energy you will be left wondering how we went from this to Lady Gaga. No offense to her, but concerts today are these epic spectaculars. It almost makes the music secondary. With Nirvana, the music is front and center. And blistering. It isn't perfect, but it is real. No post processing, no phony orchestra, just 3 wailing instruments (and a weird dancer in the middle of the stage).",1393977600,5,616,4.5

3952479,5,B002MRRRAA,"I'm not going to go into detail about what an amazing musician/performer Kurt Cobain was.  You know the name, you know the sound, etc.  This concert is a must have.  Kurt gets wheeled out onto the stage as if the backstage area was a hospital, and proceeds to rip through a set of tunes that are as relevant today as they were in '92.  Just buy this, put your feet up, grab a beer, cocktail, ur girlfriend/boyfriend etc.. and watch this band sing and play their hearts out for you!  Yes this is THAT good!  Hey Kurt, wherever you are thanks for the music & ROCK ON DUDE!!!",1278028800,7,572,4.25
3952480,5,B002MRRRAA,"I have not yet got this DVD,but I will. I have heard this was one helluva concert. I love Nirvana. I was 12 in 1967 and bought ""Strawberry Fields"" 45 as my first record bought with my parental allowance, paper-route,lawn-mowing earnings. The Beatles have always been my favorite band. The Stones and Who and et al are a distant second,third or whatever( of bands from the '60's). Kurt Cobain's melodies rival the Beatles' in their tunefulness. Nirvana should be in the R'R Hall,(even if Kurt would probably hate it-yet again,he might not,hell he couldn't make up his mind what he wanted).The Pistols,Clash,G.Dead and P.Floyd are other top bands in my book. However,the Fabs far outdistance them all. Actually,Nirvana,had they lasted longer and developed in different directions could've stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Beatles-that's how great Kurt's melodies were. God knows what more Kurt would've pulled out of his hat had he not pulled the trigger. God rest his soul.
I was recently re-viewing the April '75 ""Tomorrow Show w/ Tom Snyder"" w/ John Lennon, and I'll be damned if ol' Tom uttered a God-given Prophesy:(to Lennon:)
to paraphrase: ""Who knows,maybe some other band will come along in 1988 and re-start the rock'n'roll thing all over again,just like the Beatles did to Elvis"".
Well,Nirvana was that band and Tom Snyder is a Prophet.",1275350400,5,1348,5.104072398190045

I saw them only once in concert live and it was on the last tour they did before Kurt died. It was at a fairground in Ogden Utah, and I remember crappy sound and alot of mud, ect. This testament to the genius of the band is worth every penny to true fans. Nice to see them in true form. Fans, don't miss it!",1265155200,2,406,3.788235294117647

3952484,4,B002MRRRAA,"This concert was fortunate to be preserved in time for the enjoyment of all future generations, to offer insight into the culture of an era that redefined the polished trend of music. This is a phenomenal concert.

Part of what makes this DVD great is how unrefined the final product is. Parts where the band faltered were left in instead of edited out. One instance of this is very apparent in ""Sliver"" where Kurt Cobain starts the song off singing off key, holds back a laugh, and continues to try to find the right note. I would have been exceedingly disappointed if this was edited out. Everything about this concert has been done in tune with the philosophy of the grunge movement in the late 80s and early 90s. Everything from the on stage stumbling dancer Tony Hodgkinson (who ""still writes all [their] songs,"" =) to the chanting of the crowd, singing the songs with equal vocal force against the amplifiers of the band.

Its the small things which make this show interesting. The crowd roaring the lyrics of ""Dumb,"" which was not even on an album yet, and Krist remarks ""The power of the bootleg, Kurt!"" the tongue in cheek sense of humor of Kurt Cobain being wheeled out to the microphone in a blond wig, all make this an ""must have"" for any Nirvana fan.

That said, this dvd does have its downside.

For one, some critics have called this ""the greatest concert of all time,"" and while despite being a huge Nirvana fan for years, this simply is not true. Its a great concert, but it by no means tops the performances of Woodstock and various other legendary events.

Another issue, which I actually decided not to give the 5th star for, was the lack of interviews or bonus features. I would have loved to have seen some interviews with Dave, Krist, Kurt, or even zombie dancer Tony Hodgkinson (sure, mark me down as a Hodgkinson fan now too. It takes stones to be a one man dancing troop!)

Altogether though, great show, great set-list, and an amazing era in music, which still continues to have a solid impact on music being written over 17 years later. This is going to be a dvd you'll kick yourself 20 years from now if you don't get your hands on a copy.",1262131200,5,2168,4.5038167938931295

3952488,5,B002MRRRAA,"One of the things that struck me eventually, was the fact that here were just three lone wolfs and the sound they managed to make was amazing! Most of the bands I can think of are at least 4, most are 5 person bands. And along came Nirvana with three....and played awesomely ! Not having had the opportunity to ever see the band live, this recording is absolutely fabulous to have. I TRULY HOPE THE NIRVANA CAMP PUTS OUT ONE OF THE IN UTERO CONCERTS at some point because I would surely buy it as well. I assume eventually they will & they should. Contrary to what some people know of Cobain's views, he was a paradox when it came to his success in that he wanted commercial validation, and the money from it, as much as the next guy, but certainly shunned the notoriety associated with it.

At the time of this concert he was at a particularly difficult time in his life concerning his family - his daughter was born just 2 weeks prior and the child was removed from their care because of an article appearing in Vanity Fair painting the couple as unfit parents. I read about the incident in two sources and was struck with an idea of the terrible horror I would feel if someone had taken my child from me at any time, let alone shortly after birth. Irregardless of whether there was enough evidence pointing to the possibility of child endangerment due to drug use, I believe the state agency handling the affair should have considered (and had more compassion) a more humane way of handling the whole matter.

So if anyone was wondering why Cobain looked the way he did in the video (actually not as bad as you would think given the circumstances) yet I could see the strain in the man's face during the performance. He was also in the throes of kicking his unfortunate heroine habit - but still managed to pull out an amazing performance just to prove he wasn't DOA.  The relationship between Novoselic, Grohl & Cobain was also very strained at the time.  To me, this makes this performance all the more stunning in that it amazes me Cobain was able to perform as well as he did, though it was said of him that when it came to the business of Nirvana, Kurt was always on top when he wanted to be.

I am so sorry for his family, bandmates and friends that he did not want to continue what he had started. It seems apparent from written sources that insofar as Cobain was concerned, his own music would have progressed beyond the confines of the music genre he was in because that was what he had expressed an interest in doing. I wish exceedingly he had given himself the opportunity to do so. To Nirvana, one of my favorites, a great performance indeed & I'm very happy it was preserved for a later time.",1261526400,7,2708,4.397205588822355
