172493,5,0965621642,"I was a prof. dog trainer for 30+ yrs.  I am now disabled and want to train my own Service Dog.  I bought this video since

this type of training is not my area of expertise.  I found the video to be an excellent reference  for almost anyone to learn to train their own SD.  Very well done and training

methods emphasize patience and positive reinforcement, and lots of praise. Absolutely wonderful.",1137715200,7,400,4.472222222222222
172494,5,0965621642,"This is a dog-training video for disabled people and it's just great!! It shows you how to train your own dog to do things like turn on a touch lamp, pull a wheelchair, pick up stuff you drop on the floor, etc. It's very professionally put together and easy to follow. They also have this same thing in book form and I have both. I think the video shows the training steps real well and is fun too.",1077580800,9,398,4.115384615384615
172495,1,0965621642,I was trying to order the CD version but received the VHS version. When trying to return it I found out that the return FEE was the same amount as the CD. Now I am stuck with a VHS that I can't use and do not have the money available to purchase the CD version.,1374451200,3,261,3.7636363636363637
172496,5,0965621642,I learned so much watching this DVD. I learned what our service dogs can do and how to teach them willingly to want to help us. Plus I learned even with my disabilities I can still train my own service dog. After all I have some time on my hands and can teach my dog what I need her to do to help me. I am so pleased To have had this DVD to teach me how to teach my faithful companion to become my helper in this life.. If you want or need a service dog this can show you what you can have and how to reach your goal. If you are getting a trained service dog this can help train you how they get these dogs to help us in our daily lives. I highly recommend this DVD. This DVD can bring you and your service dog closer together.,1373500800,4,727,3.789473684210526
172497,5,0965621642,this is the sequel second part to the first teamwork and is for disabled by disabled and is pretty good.  Shows a lot of useful things to teach a service dog.  Knowing how to use this is helpful and that makes it valuable to me.,1357516800,2,228,4.044444444444444
172498,4,0965621642,The DVD shows that it can be very easy to train dogs to be of assistance.  I had hoped it would go into more details and show more techniques and different behavours.,1326240000,3,166,4.1875
172499,5,0965621642,"1st DVD never received, seller was contacted, she promptly replaced DVD! She's honorable! DVD was highly recommended by Owner Trained Service Dog (OTSD) yahoo group. I agree. Easy to understand topics: In public, Paws, Reverse, Under, Side, Take it, Play retrieve, Retrieve & carry, Get help, Brace, Light, Pull, Dress, Doors, & more.

I got it from Top Dog and would highly recommend them since they stood behind their sale when it didn't show up within original projected time frame.",1309046400,12,485,5.0625
172500,1,0965621642,This video is no help at all.  It doesn't really show you how to train the dog anything.  It was pretty lame.  Would not recomend this to anybody wanting to train their dog.,1258416000,4,173,4.181818181818182
172501,3,0965621642,"I thought it was very slow and boring at times. The information was not good for all dogs, and didn't cover any problem solving or various ways of training. I train dogs, and this was all very novice material. I was hoping for new ways to train dogs with information on training the ""hard to train"" dogs to be service dogs.",1252713600,5,323,4.311475409836065
172502,5,0965621642,"I haven't seen this DVD yet as I just ordered it for Christmas but sooooo many friends of mine who are disabled like I am highly recommend the TeamWork Series, they say both the books and videos are GREAT teaching tools. I look forward to watching this DVD as I have the Teamwork1 VHS and can't wait to get my Doberman Takkera and train her for Service Dog work",1229990400,,361,4.246376811594203

172504,5,0965621642,"Train your own assist dog lovingly and made extremely simple should be the title of this DVD.

7793815,5,0965621642,"I am working on training my dog to be a service dog.  The books and videos offer a clear explanation of how to train.  They had so many ideas that I never had even though of.  Of course it takes patience and time.  The book gives me the confidence to train my dog myself.  I had him enrolled in obedience training.  The instructor was scaring my dog instead of helping to train him during private lessons.  I dropped the instructor, loosing out several hundred dollars.  This book and DVD is simply amazing.  It has helped me to do everything myself.  My dog has learned to help pull me up a hill when I need a little help walking.  He can help me get up out of a chair, off the toilet, sit up in bed.  He helps me up and down stairs.  He helps me when I fall to get back up again.  This is all with owner training.  I felt confident enough to go out shopping by myself with my dog's help.  I haven't done that in years.  Yes, get the book and DVD.  It is a fraction of the price of professional training.",1438732800,,1005,4.066666666666666

7793820,1,0965621642,I baught this set Hoping for some Training advice but this is nothing more than a slight introduction video aimed at the general public about how service dogs can be minimally helpful to those in the videos. It was useless information.,1388102400,,235,4.7560975609756095
