8018955,5,B0001ZHOAS,"This sells for 20 to 25 euros in Spain, where I bought mine.  The container says ""ALL REGIONS"" under zone, but these will *not* play on my (USA) Sony DVD player nor my neighbor's DVD player; it says, ""Playback prohibited by area regulations"" and ejects it.  The DVD's *do* play on both Macintosh and Windows computers.  There's no question that there is some dazzling Spanish guitar playing on this two-DVD set and for that I give it five stars.  Ironically, one of my friends bought a dirt-cheap (as in $29 new) DVD player and it can play this and everything else he's tried.",1166054400,2,576,4.563106796116505
8018956,4,B0001ZHOAS,"Luca is without doubt one of the greatest and most influential geniuses the flamenco guitar has ever seen, and so such a documentary cannot fail to be (potentially at least) of the greatest interest.

Disc 1 is a documentary and is recorded in standard stereo.  Disc 2 is concert selections from 1991, and is in Dolby 5.1 surround sound (although stereo is also available).

The dialogue throughout is almost entirely in Spanish, but subtitles are available in English and French.

I was very impressed with the technical quality of this whole production: especially the video and sound quality, editing, and clarity of the subtitles.

Disc 1, the documentary, is 93 Minutes.  Disc 2 contains the entirety of Rodrigos Concierto de Aranjuez (23 min.), plus Mi Nio Curro, Zyryab, Caa de Azcar, Cancin de Amor and Alta Mar (40 min).

The documentary is intelligently constructed, in that the story is consigned to Paco and his friends and relatives, instead of to some droning narrator.  It is kaleidoscopic rather than sequential, but the narrative of his life emerges clearly nonetheless.  Paco appears clearly as a shy and private person who has been seized by a machine he cant control.  A great deal of the programme is shot around his times in Cancn, Mexico, his retreat from the world.  It seems to be an attempt to portray Paco as he really is, not to spin a load of hype; for which I was grateful. There are glimpses, at least, of most of the people who presumably have been important to him (except his wife)&sup1;, as well as of the different stages of his career.  Particularly interesting is a 30-second clip of Nio Ricardo por sole, recorded in 1959, which segues into the reminiscences of the latters daughter (known, inevitably, as La Ricarda).

I couldn't help feeling that some sections suffered from the Short Attention-Span Theatre syndrome &mdash; in particular, that about early days with Camarn, contrasted with the Chick Corea segment which I found over-long.  But this is just a personal preference.

Mstro Rodrigo (who was present) apparently approved of Pacos version of Aranjuez.  This hasn't prevented others from criticising it, but few can doubt that Paco has something of his own to say with it, like it or not.  For myself, I find a great deal to enjoy.

I cant be as enthusiastic about the remaining pieces, mostly trios with Jos Mara Bandera and Juan Manuel Caizares; my attention soon wandered, and in particular, I find myself unable to regard Zyryab as anything but musical diarrha.  But each to his own.  Although not credited, the final number in fact contains a large chunk of ""Entre dos aguas"".

The question naturally arises as to whether this opus is preferable to the British-produced one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Light-and-Shade/dp/B00005Q30W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Light and Shade</a>.  For me, the answer is definitely yes, although completists will want both.  Its more expensive, of course. But you get 160 minutes as opposed to 60.

NOTES

&sup1;According to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paco-de-Luca-En-Vivo/dp/8493304522/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paco de Luca En Vivo</a>&nbsp;by Juan Jos Tllez (p. 255), Paco separated from his wife Casilda Varela after about 20 years, and in 2000 had a daughter (Antonia) with one Gabriela Canseco.

The documentary, tastefully, touches on none of this.",1165104000,6,3441,5.373134328358209
8018957,5,B0001ZHOAS,"First of all this DVD contains the best music documentary visuals I've ever seen. The camera is steady, the lighting is perfect, and the colors stand out beautifully. Most importantly, it is subtitled and the subtitles are extremely well done.

On to the film, the first DVD contains Paco's life (essentially), history, and his conflicted view of being a musician and playing the guitar. It features scenes of his childhood home (inside and out), him (as a child), his father, his mother, the rest of his family, and his friends. Basicly everything you want to know about the man behind the guitar.

The second DVD contains various solo, concerto, trio, and sextet  footage. Again this is also wonderfully done. This is hands down one of my best purchases all year.",1106611200,11,765,4.869230769230769
