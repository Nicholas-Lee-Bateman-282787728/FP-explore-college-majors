3892518,2,B002AUIFC8,"""David Carradine's Shaolin Cardio Kick Boxing"" DVD will appeal to those who are fans of the late actor, and it provides a simple workout that if it gets people off the couch and exercising a bit, will prove productive.

There is a very short introduction by David Carradine, stating that this workout has helped him throughout the years.  Then the DVD shows Carradine, dressed in an orange robe with black sash, and four younger models dressed in black pants and tank tops, going trough the routine in a studio.  These four follow Carradine as he goes through the workout.  There is a voice over of Carradine's voice guiding the viewer rather than Carradine talking as he performs.

The first part consists of a variety of stretches done at a slow and easy pace.  This portion of the DVD lasts about fourteen and a half minutes.  Then there is a quick pause and all of the people have chairs beside them.  (So have your chair ready)  They continue to do some stretches and basic kicks holding onto the chair for balance. (Front, side, roundhouse, and back kicks are done holding the chair.  Personally, I'd have liked to have seen some instruction on how to perform the kicks correctly, since many people watching might not know how to do so.)

At the twenty-three minute mark, after the kicks, the chairs disappear and the program moves into punching.  They do some basic punches, but if the person doing them gets into a lower horse stance like a couple of the models, the legs will get some work.  They also do some ""snake"" type moves that are well, um, okay.  If it gets a person moving, that's good.  The program ends with some arm movements and breathing.  The program finishes at the thirty-eight minute mark.

Again, I think anything that gets people up and doing any kind of exercise is good.  I just don't know if this DVD will do that.  It is fairly slow paced and methodical, and pretty boring.  Nothing here to motivate someone to get up and exercise, and I feel many people would get bored following along pretty quickly.  On the other hand, the slow pace might be good for the novice to exercise programs.  But I think there are better resources out there.

As for martial arts, you won't learn any here.  For an exercise program, it is fairly slow and boring, but might be good for the complete novice, but there are better ones.  For David Carradine fans, he does not do much here.  So, basically it was a program trying to capitalize on his name for the exercise market.  So why two stars instead of one?  Because I am a fan of Carradine's and I do think that anything that gets people to do any exercise is a good thing.  So I gave an extra star to honor the late actor, and that they might have got someone off the couch.

8360437,5,B002AUIFC8,"I bought this work out DVD because I love the late David Carradine with his work, and I am a huge Martial Arts fan.  This is a basic introductory workout program themed on Shaolin Kung Fu exercises that I found very enjoyable.

 This is not an advanced P-90X style workout DVD by any means, but you still get some very fun exercise practicing along with the late Carradine and his Martial Arts students.

 I recommend this DVD and hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.  This was the first of a series I had bought, adding in later his Tai-Chi work outs, his Chi-Qong meditation exercises, the Hung Gar Kung Fu exercises, and his AM & PM Tai Chi DVD.

Very fun and filled with interesting cardio work out kickboxing movement information.",1426377600,,736,4.447761194029851
8360438,3,B002AUIFC8,"It's more of an advanced stretching exercise than a workout. If you are someone who is moderately fit. Instruction is executed well and you get the hang of the faster movemoments only after a couple times. Carradine is our main instructor but the man behind him is the real Martial Arts Expert. But I loved seeing ""Caine"" and hearing his mellow voice. I recommend this to use as an addition to your exercise routine or a very decent workout on a ""cool down"" day, it helps the muscles loosen up.",1424390400,,494,4.5
8360439,5,B002AUIFC8,"I really enjoyed the heck out of this work out video from the late David Carradine.  Even though he is gone this work out martial arts video is still enjoyable.

 He has a couple of DVDs in this series, and this one is where he does a series of Shaolin Kung Fu exercises with a group of martial arts athletes that the viewer can work out to. If you like martial arts and working out to videos, you may find this one fun and very useful to your exercise desires.

 I have always been a huge fan of the late Mr. Carradine and his ""Kung Fu"" tv series (both the original and the 90's one).  And I love martial arts so this video is cool by me, and it might be enjoyable for others too.",1423267200,,681,4.007407407407407

This did it and more.  It can be a fairly easy workout or a challenging one, depending on how much effort you put into it, but its a good place to start.",1391040000,2,372,4.211267605633803

8360442,5,B002AUIFC8,"This work out surprised me quite a bit.  My husband bought it and I thought that it was going to be super easy because the movements are not all fast.  It starts out with stretching and then leads you through a series of kicks and combos.  Depending on how much you put into it is how much you get out of it, but it turned out to be one heck of a workout.  I was surprised at how much I was sweating!  Plus it has so many stretches and breathing in it I feel like a million bucks afterword!  I wouldn't recommend this as your only workout, but it is a great one to add to your collection for a balanced workout!",1359244800,9,611,3.9672131147540983
8360443,5,B002AUIFC8,Shaolin by David Carradine is great because its so slow with the movements that it almost just puts you in this meditative state. I really enjoyed this video and its a great short workout for the day! Im going to start adding some yoga before or after just to give myself a good balancing workout. Shaolin is amazing!,1343260800,4,317,4.482758620689655
