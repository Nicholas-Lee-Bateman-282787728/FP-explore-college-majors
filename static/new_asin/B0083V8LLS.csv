8524850,4,B0083V8LLS,"This Korean film (aka `Enemy at the dead end') concerns two men, one has had a stroke Min-ho and the other has had surgery to save his life - Song-Up. They are both in recovery and have both suffered a degree of amnesia. One thing is certain though and that is that Ming-ho knows that Song-Up has done him a wrong in the past and he is going to kill him.

The plot unfolds mostly in the treatment room, but we also have interactions from the medical staff and a few flashbacks to put meat on the bones of the story. As their memories return - so does the past come back to haunt both of them.

This is one of those films that took its time to warm up and have me fully engaged. For those who like their humour dark and enjoy a psychological thriller this will be one to enjoy. The whole point of the film is in the reveals so this is not one you will want to watch more than once - but it is still made well enough to keep you guessing right till the end and I have to say it was worth the wait.",1422057600,,995,3.9207920792079207
