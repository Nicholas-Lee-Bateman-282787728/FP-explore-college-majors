7382878,1,B0142YXZ7E,"This is not the Netflix movie ""Under the Influence"".  I bought this for my brother, a musician, assuming that is was the Netflix movie.  Was very poorly done.  Amateurish and video quality is poor.  I am embarrassed that I sent it to my brother.",1455494400,,245,4.5
7382879,5,B0142YXZ7E,What more can you say but KEEF.  You never know what he will say or do.  He will never retire - which is good for the fans!  Interesting & entertaining work.,1455321600,,157,4.0
7382880,2,B0142YXZ7E,"This is not the Netflix movie ""Under the Influence"". Some of the interviews are good, and the video is crisp. Others are a bit amateurish and video quality is poor. I kept it just for a couple of the good interviews back in the ""80's but overall this ain't well done. ""The Human Riff"" is at least a real documentary on Mr. Richards. I'll be wait'in for the Netflix doc. to come out on blueray sometime.",1452124800,,402,4.302631578947368

7382882,5,B0142YXZ7E,"Right off the bat, just want to write that this is not the same as the Netflix special, ""Under The Influence"".

The interview is set around when his book ""Life"" came out in 2010. Somewhere in the middle of the program there're interviews about his feud with Mick that almost split the Stones.

Overall, a pleasant program for die hard Keith Richards fans.",1450310400,2,355,4.619047619047619
7382883,5,B0142YXZ7E,"""In his own Words"" is not yet released. There is a similar bio now playing on ""NETFLIX"" and its excellent. The move is called  ""Keith Richards ""Under the Influence"".",1443484800,8,165,4.689655172413793
8729511,1,B0142YXZ7E,A bunch of horrible interviews with Keith that you can see on YouTube for free total waste of time. Right from the dvd player to the trash !!!,1491350400,,142,4.107142857142857

8729513,5,B0142YXZ7E,"Plain and simple, this is Keith Richards!",1483228800,,41,5.0
8729514,5,B0142YXZ7E,"In a word ""Keef"" - what is not to love?  You can't help but be reminded that he is one smart cat, thoughtful, relatively humble, insightful and realistic.  I love listening to his thought processes.  This artist is nobody's fool, but he is at his core a real blues and rock-and-roll man.  Someone you would love to just hang out with and listen to.  This compilation gives you a second-hand opportunity to do that.  Recommended.",1480377600,,428,4.64

8729518,1,B0142YXZ7E,"I love Keef, but I didn't like this video. It's just rehashed interviews from the past. Not too relevant. I played about 10 minutes of it and was too disappointed in the content to keep playing. I'm gonna donate the video to Goodwill because it doesn't belong in my collection of Keef memorabilia. Doesn't belong in my collection!",1461369600,,330,4.706896551724138
8729519,5,B0142YXZ7E,Good Book.,1457568000,,10,4.5
8729520,1,B0142YXZ7E,"As noted in other reviews it is not ""Under the Influence"".  It is packaged to give that impression  the photo of Richards is from ""Under the Influence,""  the production date is the same, and the title ""In His Own Words"" is a description of ""Under the Influence"".  It is all very clever and deceptive and aided by Amazon taking you directly to it when searching for ""Under the Influence"", which is a great documentary that will hopefully be released by Netflix in the future.",1456963200,3,474,4.607142857142857
