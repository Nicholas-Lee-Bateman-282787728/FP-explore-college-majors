597623,3,6303213650,"Jennifer Jason Leigh is so amazing in this movie. This movie tries to be one of those old screwball comedies from the 30's and 40's. It does it very well and Jennifer Jason Leigh does it perfectly. Her intelligent, loud,  deep-voice, fast-talking, wise-cracking, head-strong character reminded me  so much of Katharine Hepburn in films like ""Holiday"" and  ""The Philadelphia Story"". She even got the accent right. I  thought there could never be another Katharine Hepburn, but Jennifer Jason  Leigh has almost nailed it. Amazing! Who would have thought that that young  blond actress from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" would have come  so far? I'm really impressed.",922665600,,665,5.158878504672897
597624,4,6303213650,"Joel Coen shows in this film all his talent and creativeness. It is very stylish and visual - because in the movies, the eyes are more important than the ears. For viewers who enjoy camera movements, this film is  delightful, there is a lot of them. The suicide scene in the beginning is  amazing. The movie may remind you of the Terry Gilliam's film  ""Brazil"", for its fantastic and strange climate. Jennifer Jason  Leigh makes an impressive and surprising acting.",917740800,,465,4.775

597800,5,6303213650,"Spoiler alert:  I'm a big fan of the Bros.  And while I really like the Coen movies that most people also really like, I've got a big mushy spot for this one, too -- the box office turkey that cemented the critical narrative that the Bros can sometimes be too clever for their own goods.  This is my third or fourth time watching Proxy, and I kept busting up laughing -- hard, raucous laughter -- like I was eight again watching the Three Stooges.  So much in there ... Seriously, no spoilers, but I'll just say that who knew Paul Newman had such murderous comedic timing ;)

I get where the critics are coming from.  The movie's such an enthusiastic homage / parody of Hawkes, Capra, and Lang (and Terry Gilliam) that the characters and dialogue can seem like pure burlesque.  (Hey, I'm also a Thomas Pynchon fan, so I'm used to fending off those sorts of brickbats).  It's probably harder for younger people (who aren't glued to TCM) because it really requires being marinated in those old flicks to fully savor what the Bros are doing to and for them.  (And it's Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday, not Hepburn or Stanwyck, who is Jennifer Jason-Leigh's keylight).

The opening scenes are especially ... stagey (it helps to imagine those scenes as a play).  And the plot isn't going to help you, because it's hot glued to the Capra conventions and none of the events are remotely surprising.  But you have to just let yourself go with it -- tell yourself it's like watching It's a Wonderful Life for the elevendy-gajillionth time -- and just drink in all the uniquely delicious Coen elements.  The drop-dead hysterical walk-on characters.  The beyond amazing scenic design.  The absolutely brilliant use of Aram Kachaturian's music.  And the movie's basic conceit -- an alternate history of the Hula Hoop.  Legally mandated props to Wham-O (""a true American success story"") in the credits, to be sure ...

It also helps that Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason-Leigh are perfectly cast and have a real chemistry.  Sure, the boy meets girl, boy gets a big head and alienates girl, boy learns Valuable Life Lessons and turns it around love story is not exactly, you know, novel.  But there's a moment in there when goofy-innocent Tim Robbins becomes a true stud muffin of unlikely metaphor.  Discover it for yourselves ;)  I'll freakin' admit I sniffled, okay ;)

Sure, it's not an existential mind screw like Barton Fink or The Man Who Wasn't There.  And there's no character so gosh-darn adorable you just want to give them a hug like Marge from Fargo.  There's really no Big Takeaway from a film like this; the social commentary is very light.

But if you truly love movies, you owe yourself an indulgence in this one.",1490659200,,2718,4.693446088794926
597801,4,6303213650,"The HUDSUCKER PROXY was actually better than I remember.  I was somewhat amused by its offbeat humor when first seeing the PROXY years and years ago, but upon seeing it again (now a much more seasoned 'old school' film fan) I see just how much THE HUDSUCKER PROXY pays comic homage to all things good, funny, and easy to make fun of in those  'old' 1940's movies where the dialogue was smart and TOO fast on the speak while the 'dame' in the Newspaper, Front Page type has to prove she can be a reporter just like 'one of the guys' complete with non-stop, cigarette smoking, and a rapid fire slap on the face -- or two.
Jennifer Jason Leigh steals the show in this one doing a comic impersonation cross somewhere between Catherine Hepburn (banter with Spencer Tracy) and Barbara Stanwyck (Frank Capra's ""Meet John Doe"").
The Coen Brothers must have liked those old movies.  Their characters are Acting like people from those movies, although it is New Years Eve 1958 in HUDSUCKER.
Anyways, the HUDSUCKER PROXY manages a great, classic, 1940's look while NOT being in black-and-white, yet the sets - and the Off-coloring of the film - reminds me of The Big Clock (with Ray Milland) which has a memorable 'modern' look to it in its own right, especially, for a movie from 1948.
HUDSUCKER PROXY is fun and dark which leads to a pretty ridiculous, fun, yet dark, comparison to It's a Wonderful Life by the end.  Lots of good lines more-than-likely good for second and third viewings.

597805,3,6303213650,"The three stars has nothing to do with the movie. It's one of my favorite cult classics and I'm glad to have it on Blu-Ray. The review is for the quality of the Blu-Ray itself. The transfer is great, the features are blah. It is basically a VHS type version of the movie. You have the movie, and that's it. There is no commentary, no featurette, no chapter selection, etc. If you're here and all you're looking for is a quality copy of a great movie, then I suggest you buy it.",1483660800,,477,4.195652173913044

I am a fan of some 50's movies, but the ""send-up"" of the style here was overdone in my opinion.",1482969600,,267,4.056603773584905
597808,5,6303213650,"I liked this.  Who knew Paul Newman had a gift for comedy as the evil cigar chomping bad guy?  The scene where Tim Robbins had to deliver the ""Blue Letter"" had me laughing a lot.  He keeps badgering Norville (Tim) on his history to find out if what * kind * of idiot he might be and when he realizes Tim doesn't regard himself that way,... the camera shot looking up at Paul Newman's sneer when he says ""Get out of the chair!!"" and all of the slapstick of the next 5 minutes is very funny.  Yeah the Coen Brothers have their ""presets"" and they wink through the script similar to what Spielberg does...but they are, on the whole, talented enough that I can ignore that.  The film runs a bit long, but I liked it.

See the movie to see what the ""And they'll Dock Ya!"" reference is to.  : )

PRO:  Video quality of this Blu-Ray is good and the sound is decent (DTS sound), however.....

CON:  There seems to be NO OPTION to jump to particular scene / chapter points.  Just ""Play Movie"".  I am not used to this.  Sometimes I like the option to go to a favorite scene on my Blu-Rays (and no, You Tube isn't what I always want to use).  UPC on this disc is:  8331660568.  I do get a choice to toggle on or off the English subtitles which are accurate and well done.",1482883200,,1259,4.136363636363637

597902,1,6303213650,"It is an embarrassment to the actors.  It is only testimony to the power of being Coen brothers - and I didn't even know who they were until I did I search to see who was responsible for this utter failure.  If I were connected to any of the following movies, or the estates of the people involved in them, , I would sue the Coen brothers for bad plagiarism:  Bringing Up Baby; His Girl Friday, It Happened One Night, Arsenic and Old Lace,  - hell - just do a search for ""screwball comedies.""

I'm a Film major watching this for an analytical class that is currently covering the Coen Bros.

I actually picked this one to watch because it was nearly at the top of a list of Coen bros films that was ordered from worst to best. I thought it would make things more interesting. And I was totally right.

This is a comedy film that seems to use a lot of dry, situational comedy that I really like. It's completely unique and just left me confused more than a few times in the best way possible. Of course there's things that aren't very good- like the annoying accent of the female lead. But in a movie that isn't taking itself dead-seriously, I can easily see over that and enjoy the film for what it is.",1474243200,2,773,4.244897959183674

598948,4,6303213650,"This one is truly a film from another time. Speech patter rhythms straight out of The Front Page, characters physically channeling a very young and slim Orson Welles or Katherine Hepburn in her screwball comedy best, stylized dream sets that could easily have been designed by William Cameron Menzies (the mail room could also be straight out of Brazil) and the proper period setting for a Hawks, Capra or a Sturges comedy.

While a few of the Cohen Bros. films straddle the line between realism and fantasy, sometimes with only a single dream sequence to show for fantastic content (but if Bunuel could get away with it, why not the Coens?), this one goes clearly into fantastic territory.

It would be easy to disregard one fantastic scene, but we clearly get two (or arguably three) of them with at least three fantastic characters. In one, maybe God, but more likely the (good) spirit of Hudsucker Enterprises (standing in for American Enterprise?) reveals information no one could know to a nosy reporter.
In another an angel rescues a plummeting would be suicide. And in the last one, the good and dark side of the enterprise (but maybe God and the Devil) fight it out with the young would be suicide's life in the balance, along with the future of Hudsucker in a gigantic gear set (is this the inside of the mind of Hudsucker Enterprises?) while time stops.

It's good to be familiar with the goings on, and maybe to stop and reflect while they are happening, the rhythm is all so fast that the movie may end and the audience will be left gasping for breath and wondering what just the heck happened.

In short:

The CEO of Hudsucker dies without an heir, and his stock are soon to go public. In order to be able to afford the controlling 51% the board of directors choose an untried replacement (a proxy) in the hopes that stock value will plummet, that they will be able to afford it then, and that in the (near) future stock value will go up again with them still in control.
What they do not know is that either God or the spirit of Hudsucker Enterprises is looking out for the company and that the untried proxy doesn't quite do what they were expecting of him.

But just what does this have to do with anything and why is it a good story? Well, that is just the skeleton in which the Coens and Raimi stage a stylized and fantastical recreation of screwball comedies of the 1930s in which things go up and down and around and around and up again (look for the circle leitmotif).

In one of those weird synchronous incidents saw this in a double bill with Casino Royale...  a film with some surprising parallels to this one.",1446422400,,2635,4.532631578947369

Their more recent effort, ""Oh, Brother"" has some very good moments that really touch the soul of the characters and the time and place.  When they are all sitting around the fire dreaming about what they will do with all of the money they think they are going to get, their big dreams are focused on basic self-respect like buying back the family farm from the foreclosing bank or buying a restaurant so he can dress in a suit and have people say ""yes, sir or no sir, and in a jiffy, Pete... and get all my meals for free....""  So well acted, and the music...

But this Hudsucker Film, I avoided watching it for at least 20 years based on the photo on the cover alone.  I finally just took the leap of faith for $2.99 because I was too lazy to try to find something else.  I loaded it in before I could think about it.  It was okay, I guess.

The features aren't anything special, but the film looks great and the story still warms the heart. We introduced it to our daughters (ages 11 and 13) this past week and they both enjoyed it enough to talk to their friends at school about it. That's the most glowing endorsement a film can get in this house! Our daughters are picky and because my husband and I volunteer at the Sundance Film Festival every year, they get to see a wide variety of spectacular films. I'll admit it: We're a family of film snobs. We have specific tastes.

Tim Robbins' performance in Hudsucker is spot on. He keeps us invested in the film with his wide-eyed sense of wonder. While Paul Newman and Jennifer Jason Leigh both give strong leading performance, I find that my biggest smiles come from the smaller roles by John Mahoney and Bruce Campbell. Leigh & Campbell's dynamic strengthens both characters and helps create a deeper sense of duality in Leigh's role. It's a family film that doesn't talk down to its audience.

The camera was on a crane, and moved between the model buildings to simulate the aerial shot.  The second was the stunt of Norville Barnes falling to within a few inches of the ground, then stopping suddenly.  From what I remember, the Coens didn't feel comfortable letting Tim Robbins do the scene without some assurances, so Ethan Coen strapped himself in the harness and let the crew use him just to show it was safe.

599513,5,6303213650,"Directed with flare and style, this little scene and maybe underappreciated Coen Brothers film is a wonderful example of how a film's title can be misleading.  Most people (myself included) glance at the title and the movie poster and raise an eyebrow.  It just sounds and looks rather off-putting.  Despite names like Coen and Newman on the cover, the way the film was (and still is) marketed leaves a lot to be desired.

The film is GREAT!

`The Hudsucker Proxy' almost reminded me of the Coen Brothers take on a 1940's newspaper comedy (think `My Girl Friday' mixed with Coen Brothers humor and a dash of Woody Allen physical antics) and I was pretty much hooked from scene one.

The film tells the story of Norville Barnes, a hapless young man looking for a job with zero experience but a lot of ambition.  He has ideas, but his ideas are met with sketisism.  That is, until he seeks employment with Hudsucker Industries the very same day the president and owner of the company commits suicide.  Left in a bind, Sidney Mussburger, who is somewhat left in charge after the loss of his boss, makes an executive decision.  In order to sway the masses away from buying stock in the company, so that Mussburger and his cronies can own the company entirely, he hires Barnes, who he deems an idiot, and places him in position of President of the company.

His plan backfires.

Throw in a sassy journalist determined to expose Barnes for a moron and a guardian angel in the form of a mysterious employee/narrator and you have an engaging film that has style, substance and moments of pure hilarity.

Robbins is aces here, delivering a brilliantly comedic performance that contains the right amount of `black comedy' needed to sell every scene.  Working with Robert Altman paid off for him.  Newman is steady evil, and Charles Durning has a brilliant cameo as the dead Waring Hudsucker.  I honestly can't decide if Jennifer Jason Leigh is the film's weakest link or the reason I love the movie so much.  She is so abrasive, like a complete caricature (although many of the characters feel like they are ripped from a comic strip) and yet that is either a delight or a detractor; but I honestly can't decide which.

Cinematography?  Excellent.
Direction?  Excellent.
Cast?  Perfect.
Acting?  Hilarious.

Tim Robbins is couldn't have been better in his ""Mr. Deeds Goes To Town"" simpleton role; but adds an element of physical comedy that is hard to find these days.  His facial expressions and clueless stupid, remarks are always well timed.

Paul Newman is the perfect jerk executive in one his last starring roles, and was quite a find for this cast - sure, sure.

Jennifer Jason Leigh does a fair job of mocking-up Catherine Hepburn, but can still pull-off the pouty little girl just as well.

Also loved Bill Cobbs' role of Ole Moses; both in narration and onscreen.

599779,4,6303213650,"This movie coincided with ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" one of the most serious dramatic movies in the 1990s, and was funny, smart, and a little bizarre.  It is fun, romantic (in ways) and carries with it a very moralistic story.  (You know, for kids!)  ;-)

What truly bothers me about this release is the audio.  It is only in DTS 2ch.  This would seem to imply that it would be the standard stereo that matches its original theatrical release.  Instead, I find myself playing ""Up-and-down"" with my remote when I watch it on my non-surround system.  Frustrating!!  Why did they not offer the stereo soundtrack?

For those who do not understand this complaint, when you watch a movie with surround sound, the dialog is supposed to come out of a center channel.  The left and right front speakers will carry some of the dialog, but it's just to augment the center channel.  Those speakers are more for the music and dramatic sound effects.  Thus, when you watch it on a regular TV or on a stereo (not surround) system, you have dialog that sounds like a whisper.  So, you turn it up.  And then THE MUSIC STARTS IN, AND THE CARS BEEP, OR EXPLOSIONS HAPPEN, OR GUNS SHOOT so you turn the sound down to a manageable level.  And then all that stops, people start talking again, and they are speaking at a whisper again.  *Sigh.*  Very frustrating.

For a movie this old, to find the Blu-ray offering only DTS sound is a little odd.

It's still well worth owning, but you should be aware of the sound issue, and know that if you try to watch it on a non-surround system, you'll be playing yo-yo with your remote.  But hey, yo-yos are for kids, too!!  ;-)

The video is clean, though, even if there are absolutely no extras aside from the theatrical trailer.  The main menu doesn't even give you a Chapters option!

So, in spite of this being one of my favorite movies, I can't give this release five stars.  It would be nice if they would re-release this movie some day with better options and maybe some extras.",1370131200,4,2005,4.5

It often gets lost with their other 1990s output like ""Fargo"", ""Miller's Crossing"", ""The Big Lewbowski"", and ""Barton Fink"". The movie features a charming, witty, and cleverly written screenplay by the Coens and Sam Raimi. It perfectly evokes films from the 1930s and 1940s. The Coens add some wonderful and inventive visual flourishes in their direction. Tim Robbins' goofy protagonist with a lot of heart and a big idea, but not much else. I feel Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is a bit too big. It's easy to see what she's aiming for, but the other performers are able to ground their characters in a way that Leigh doesn't quite pull off. Paul Newman also has fun as a scene stealing villain.

The picture quality is relatively mediocre. It looks good in general, but it's not an appreciable upgrade from the DVD. There's less compression and slightly more detail than the DVD. On a whole, there's some light filtering and digital sharpening in the mix as well. The sound, presented in stereo, is good, but unspectacular as well.

Overall, it's a great movie. The Blu-ray fails to really impress, but it's still a good presentation of the movie and still the best out there.",1366416000,2,1231,4.80188679245283
599845,4,6303213650,"Backed by a budget augmented by Warner Bros. and producer Joel Silver, the Coen Brothers' THE HUDSUCKER PROXY ranked as one of the biggest box-office disappointments of 1994. Despite impressive physical production design by Dennis Gassner and Roger Deakins' exceptional cinematography, mainstream viewers had scant interest in the Coens' admittedly offbeat, and lightweight, ""big business fantasy"" that still remains a must for the filmmakers' devotees.

Set in 1958, ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" - scripted by Joel and Ethan Coen along with Sam Raimi - stars Tim Robbins as a midwestern college graduate who comes to the big city armed with large ambitions but no experience. He's able to nab a job in the mailroom of Hudsucker Industries, a company that's just seen its owner (Charles Durning) leap to his death from over 40 floors above, leaving the company in the hands of conniving Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman). Seeking to deplete the company's worth so its board members can purchase its stock for cheap, Mussburger puts Robbins' Norville Barnes in charge of the whole enterprise, not counting on Norville's grand plan - the hula hoop - becoming a worldwide sensation.

Like many of the Coens' films, ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is difficult to describe in terms of its genre classification. Its view of big-business comes off like a Coen riff on ""Mad Men,"" with corporate scheming viewed as an almost life-or-death struggle (quite literally in the film's climactic moments), while incorporating elements of a fairy tale and a romantic comedy for good measure. The latter is supplied by Jennifer Jason Leigh's newspaper reporter, who masquerades as a secretary for Norville but eventually falls for his irrepressibly naive charms. She sounds like she's out of a 1940s movie newsroom, and the Coens mix up the drawing-room machinations with memorable set-pieces that are eclectic and inventive (Norville's dream sequence with a tango dancer and a montage involving the hula hoop itself most notably among the latter).

The movie doesn't entirely come together - and there are times it's not as funny as it would like to be - but it's such an endearing film that I've grown fonder of it with each viewing. The gently falling snow and brown-hued textures in Deakins' cinematography, the familiar supporting faces (Bruce Campbell, Steve Buscemi, Anna Nicole Smith and Jon Polito appear), and Carter Burwell's superb usage of Khachaturian compositions make for a movie that's a one-of-a-kind Coen experience through and through.

Making its Blu-Ray debut exclusively from the Warner Archive, Warner's BD release is straightforward and satisfying. The 1080p AVC encoded transfer is as crisp as the film's visuals allow (its brown/greyish visual scheme will never make for an ""eye popping"" pallet), while the Dolby Stereo Spectral Recording soundtrack is encoded in a 2.0 DTS MA track. The movie's jaunty theatrical trailer, set to Danny Elfman's ""Back to School,"" does the best it can to sell the material to mainstream audiences, but the picture's most engaging elements are in its offbeat tone - one that's impossible to convey in a two-minute ad, much less a written review!",1365033600,4,3170,5.209803921568628

If I were the razzies, or whatever the award for bad movies is, this would take every category and break every record.  This is like watching a corny musical Scenes from a Mall, which may be the actual worst movie of the 80s.  This is the one for the nineties.

Robbins is perfect as a ""capraesque"" hero in the mold of Jimmy Stewart and Jennifer Jason Leigh does a great job playing a role Katherine Hepburn probably would have had if the movie had really been made back in Hollywood's golden age.

The problem with the movie is that when it plays it straight, the way Capra did with films like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" it's absolute magic.  The scenes with Robbins and Leigh are wonderful.

But when the movie slips into an attempt to parody films like those, that's when it stumbles and starts looking surreal and grotesque.

600008,4,6303213650,"The Hudsucker Proxy, released in 1994, is the Coen Brothers' homage to screwball comedies of the 1940s, particularly the works of directors like Preston Sturges. This film (co-written with Sam Raimi) was the Coens first film given a substantial budget and it went on to become a box-office failure. Many consider it one of the Coen's worst efforts. But is The Hudsucker Proxy a bad film? Hardly.

The year is 1958 and Waring Hardsucker (Charles Durning), president of Hudsucker Industries, suddenly leaps from the window of his company with no rhyme or reason. Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) is worried about the future of the company and hatches a scheme to get the stock down only to snatch it all up before it rises. For this to work, the company needs a new president, preferably a ""proxy.""

The proxy is naive country-boy Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), who works in the mailroom. He seems to be the perfect candidate, but Norville has a trick up his sleeve, in the shape of a circle.

The other major player is Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a fast-talking, Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter who sees something wrong with the simple-minded Norville's sudden promotion.

As I said earlier in this review, the film is meant to be in the spirit of the screwball comedies of so many years ago. I can almost guarantee I haven't seen a single specific film that inspired this one, but I'm familiar enough with the genre to appreciate what the Coens did here. For what it lacks in story and character, it more than makes up for in style and dialogue.

The dialogue is fast-paced, mile-a-minute, no-nonsense (sort of a contradiction being a ""screwball comedy"")dialogue that is not only hard to imitate but certainly hard to come up with. Not only is the dialogue pitch-perfect but the actors know exactly how to deliver it. Furthermore, the cinematography is miraculous and the set design is impeccable. It's hard to ignore how perfectly the Coen's captured the style and humor of these films.

With that said, many have pointed out that The Hudsucker Proxy values style over substance. I can't disagree with that. I think all the actor's played their roles to the best of their ability, but much of it does walk a fine line with parody. Paul Newman, however, is delightful as Mussburger and adds some much-needed austerity to the production.

While considered a rare failure by the Coen Brothers, I would not call this film a failure. It's a screwball comedy unlike any other since the genre was in its prime and it's made even better by having the distinct touch of the Coen Brothers on it. Despite it's imperfections, I find it hard to dislike or dismiss this film.

At this moment your life is suspended in mid air by one blonde hair of your ideal love affair, or love targeted prey, ,and that hair is the broom stick of a black janitor, which is niggardly indeed, and the denture of an old spook who refuses innovation in stock exchange managing.

And the newly made rich man is living his accident - becoming rich out of no logic - as if it were natural and did not require any thinking, pondering and brain exploration if not surgery, like in some cuckoo's nest of fame.

Another reviewer compared it to HOW TO SUCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT TRYING, and that's not a bad comparison, because business success is for schmucks.  A Schmuck with a brain, sometimes, but a Schmuck with Luck more often than not.

This isn't really a comedy, though; it seems more serious than that.  The muted lighting and colors give it a gravity that a comedy doesn't normally have. Also, there isn't really anything all that funny or laughter-provoking in it, and Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh, while certainly talented, are not strong comedic performers.

600082,5,6303213650,"It is a shame that tightly envisioned, edited, unique, totally enjoyable and entertaining from beginning to end, but generally unknown to the masses, ""Hollywood"" films like this, are so rare and special, and seemingly come along so infrequently.  But this is surely one of them.

The Coen Brothers (Ethan and Joel) have been writing, directing, and producing movies for some time, and are still at it, and while countless fans have their particular favorites among many of the brothers' efforts (including ""Raising Arizona,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""Fargo,"" and ""Burn After Reading,"" etc.), this effort remains my personal favorite of theirs, and may always be so.

While this returned little real box-office popularity/profit or awards during first release or afterwards, it remains my most cherished Coen Brother's film and one of my all-time great movies in particular.  For it blends hokey and comically noirish, but thoroughly wonderful, old-time movie genre elements and characters brilliantly with non-obtrusive but totally effective camera techniques, and does so in a way that few, if any other attempts at the same, have ever come close to.

Mixing various cinematic forms and styles, this harkens back to earlier, similar movies, but with a much sharper wit and wisdom, and an insider, knowing wink of an eye, imparted upon nearly every scene and shot.  And while other films which have dealt with the same general ideas, are many and noteworthy, this one remains special.  Strangely enough, the film's general political/social views, continue to be relevant to this day, if in a more serious mode in real-life as compared to this broad, fictional satire.

Generally, the movie deals with hapless, harmless, good-intentioned but naive and innocent everyman ""Norville Barnes"" (Tim Robbins) and how he rises from bottom to top to bottom to top in the crazy world of corporate politics.  This at times seems a re-working of ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" but on weird steroids, albeit with a lot of relaxing, enlightening, insightful and eventually hilarious deep puffs on a chill pipe to even things out.  The end results are simply genius, shot to shot, scene to scene, with little if no filler at all.  In fact, few films I've ever seen, are as truly ""tight"" as this, among all genres.  There are really no wasted shots or scenes, and the film moves along towards its end much quicker than the appreciative viewer wants it to, all of which only adds to the absolute enjoyment.

Norville rises to the head cheese of the company/corporation he is hired by within a fluke, with many flukes, twists and turns to follow, only to see it all crash down upon him at one point.  But his initial, humble employment (and ""idea"" - for kids, you know), is only the beginning of many rises and falls within the corporate environment of ""Hudsucker,"" a Wall-Street behemoth of the late 50's, whose fortunes rise and fall many times within the same movie.  If there ever was a film which still, many years later, directly relates to generally true themes from times of yore, to present day (and the seeming bizarre if not comedic economic troubles from today's headlines), it is this.  In fact, as time passes, this movie becomes ever more relevant, and while most of it is done in exaggerated, almost cartoonish styles, the Coen's inimitable touches of basic ""common knowledge"" truths beneath the whole are always very present.

Paul Newman and Jennifer Jason Leigh are fantastic in supporting roles, the former as the truly ""bad guy"" corporate swine on auto-pilot, and the latter as a totally delightful, dead-on, old movie, fast-talking and cynical Katherine Hepburn-ish newspaper reporter.  Leigh's persona is that of a materialistic, opportunistic, fast talking ""career-gal,"" but which hides an eventually revealed heart of gold and love for Norville, the wet-behind-the-ears ""schmoe"" who she initially sets out to destroy to further her own aspirations.

There are so many twists and turns and exquisitely detailed moments within this one movie, that I think almost any review does the film injustice, which makes me almost hesitant to try.  But if you are at all a fan of older but truly inventive and original movies, especially the frenetic black and white ""screwball comedies"" of days gone by, and have a general insight into the way mega-corporations really work (as I think I do), I promise you will love this and find much value in nearly every scene and shot.  And find new pleasures in every repeated viewing (as I do).

This is the Coen Brother's finest release, in my opinion, and that is saying a lot considering their historic and growing, substantial body of work.  There are so many great, timeless themes here which are generally relevant and entertaining, that it's hard for me to imagine any general movie buff/fan who will not eat this up as filmic candy, if they have not already done so.  There are also many other minor roles and characters, played by some familiar faces, which only add to the experience of watching this true masterpiece, and at times, the non-comedic elements (the drama and the romance) fill and enhance any possible gaps.

This is a first class winner, with a really wonderful musical score to boot, and from beginning to end, has definitely earned its way onto my short list of DVD's to own someday.  It is a work which is filled from start to finish with enchanting. mirthful but moving, meticulously edited curious joys, one after another, and continuously compelling twists and turns along the way.

This movie is essentially, ""you know, for kids...,"" my personally most memorable quote (and idea) from the film.  In other words, this nonstop, entertaining romp is for decent, unselfish, idealistic, romantic kids of all ages, not yet spoiled or corrupted by the Ayn-Randish, pessimistic, immoral nightmare which corporate, capitalist Wall-Street America has been for far too long.  And which sadly, according to the headlines these days, apparently still is.

600143,2,6303213650,"The Cohens are clever guys, and this is a clever movie. It is snappy, shot in a great almost magical realist style that captures the tremendous vibe, snap and power structures of great Wall Street companies of the 1950s, and offers a great spoof of the American Dream, manifested in the form of mailroom boy getting to the boardroom on the top floor.

The plot, however, is fairly weak. The Cohens try to slather over the predictably of their story - which is basically no hoper flukes his way to the top of a corrupt organization, falls victim to the trappings of power himself then learns his lesson and rules with virtue (how mawkish) with an elaborate set up of symbols - circles, hula hoops, bendy straws, wheels of fortune etc. and neat conflict between the straight lines of the buildings, the windows, and the circle motifs of the movie - circularity of fate, of circumstance, even in a bizzare metaphysical twist, of time.

Clever, yes, but heartfelt, no. The movie is zany, but never takes off like some of their more successful screwball efforts. The Cohens seem to write their movies on a kind of vibe - they have a sense of an idea, develop it, and sometimes it looks as if it will be a total failure but turns out genius (i.e The Man Who Wasn't There, Lebowski) and sometimes, as with the likes of Barton Fink and this movie, they have an idea that they clearly think will be a sublime incarnation of American original moviemaking, but doesn't quite come off.",1189641600,5,1473,4.575757575757576

That was an incredible clip and I think I'll view it again after writing this. Furthermore, Jennifer Jason Leigh's accent is priceless as is the send up of the old school newsroom.

I read a review where some guy panned this because it rips on capitalism.  Good grief, man.  Loosen up and enjoy an intelligent, dark comedy.

Some nobody schlub from Muncie, Indiana, namely one Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), arrives in the big town and has big plans.  ""You know, for kids"".  So begins one of the greatest movies ever written, acted, directed, edited, whatever.  This is fantastic, great, superb, excellent... you get the point.

So, Norville is out to take on the world, fresh out of Muncie Business College.  He carries his plan for the next big thing in his shoe, it is drawn out in great detail on a neatly folded piece of plain white paper; it is a perfect circle.  ""You know, for kids.""  Robbins committed so fully to this role that I cannot imagine anyone else being able to pull it off.  His stupid but smart, funny but not, noble but humble, etc... portrayal is amazing.

Paul Newman, Sid Musburger, the # 2 guy, is looking for ""a proxy, a pawn"", someone that can fill the recently emptied head seat of the board of Hudsucker Industries; because Mr. Hudsucker leapt 43 stories ""not counting the mezzanine"".  They need an idiot to make the stock drop and a Muncie man is perfect for that job.  Heck, he even gets to pitch his idea to the board and they love it, for all the wrong reasons.

Buzz, the elevator boy is friggin' hilarious.

Jennifer Jason Leigh, does the fast talking, big city reporter schtick to perfection.  She plays the hard-hearted softy very well and somehow makes it work between her and Robbins.

The dude who has the idea for the hula hoop, he draws a circle and expects people to understand what it is, and they never ask what it is they just ignore it like they think he's retarded or something. And the reporter gal's voice is so funny because it exists completely out of context. (People who dislike this movie seem to take the accent seriously.)

And the old guy who gets up like he's going to the bathroom or changing a lightbulb or something, really slowly while the other twenty guys around the table watch in silence, and then runs the length of the boardroom table like a diving board and dives through the glass of the 44th floor.

I think the funniest part though was when the other old dude tells Tim Robbins he's fired, but he still insists on trying to put out the fire he started in the trashcan, and he walks over to the window for some reason and the old dude thinks he's trying to leave like he told him to, and he's like ""not that way, through the door"". omg that was so funny.

And the sequence where the hula hoop finally reaches it's popularity, some kid finds one and starts using it and a crowd of kids stare for a while then run away screaming, seemingly in horror.

They don't direct your attention to a certain place and then put the joke there, they hit you with it while you're waiting for something else to happen. A lot like Sarah Silverman and her Program.

There is a visible surrealistic environment around this original modern fable, that focuses around a country bumpkin who suddenly becomes (by these unexpected destiny' tricks) an unwitting pawn, the non planned invited to ruin a thriving and fruitful corporation.

An eye-minded film recreated around the 50' s with febrile good taste, weird characters, flaming script and powerful imagination. One senses the magic Fellini` s touch along the film. An incredible journey through the infinite possibilities that arouse from a just simple question: what if. ?

The brothers Coen have somehow signified in USA what Terry Gilliam and the Monty Python in U.K, Fellini in Italy, Buuel in Mexico and Spain or Philipe De Broca with King of hearts.  Overflowing creativity, unusual proposals, use of the black humor until the last unimaginable frontiers, a sharp and smart change of the logical perspective through a dreadful alteration of the coordinates of the common sense, where the insane world simply has turned the eye-camera toward us, reminding us that admirable Shakespeare sentence: What's is the reason the nuts cannot wisely talk about the unwise things of the sensate people?

So much Hollywood talent and money wasted on a bad idea, so what else is new?  The Coen's have jumped the shark with this take off of the American Screwball Comedy of the 30's.  I cringed every time Jennifer Jason Leigh tried to imitate Katharine Hepburn's classic gargle.  The poor actress may have destroyed her career with this stinker.

I can't stand Tim Robbin's politics, but must admit that he is the best actor to play a fool in the movies.  He almost carries this farce.  Paul Newman; however, is collecting a check.  He's been collecting checks since the 50's.  His salad dressing stinks too.

Although some children, and particularly adults who are 'young at heart' will appreciate the antics of the title character (played superbly by Tim Robbins), the film is really for those who are fans of first-rate, rapid-fire dialogue, and sublte (often mislabelled as 'quirky') humor. OR fans of the Coen Brothers, OR of Tim Robbins.  All are in their prime here.

(...), the true greatness of this movie is revealed in the fact that, while the story is engaging, and the portrayals are all spot-on for a comedic take on a story of innocence and corruption (not to mention it has Paul Newman), like Monty Python's work, there's a gem to be uncoverred in almost every single line of dialogue.  Consequently, it just gets better and better with repeated viewings, and fans of quoting movies will have a treasure trove of useful one-liners on their hands.

My favorite scene? It's got to be the two over-worked, lunchbreak New York cabbies who narrate, in their own unique way, the scam-in-progress first meeting between our two main characters, seated across a diner from them, beginning with the line:

The ""Hud"" is a nod to the old Capra films and the Coen brothers obviously love playing with different styles of film to follow the conventions while making their own spins on the genres.  The Coens are the only director/writers/producers who seem to be able to do this consistently without becoming annoying or overly self-referential.  The Horatio Algiers-ish story of the hardworking rube coming to the big city to make his fortune and succeeding against all odds is funny and engaging.  The actors, design, dialoge, mood (especially the washed out lighting used throughout the movie), are all meticulously put together to make a fantastically entertaining movie.  Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh and John Mahoney turn in fantastic performances and what can you say about Paul Newman?

600218,3,6303213650,"Positives:

1)  It is original, different, and fun.  If you are tired of the same ol' movie that Hollywood basically stamps from a mold then you might enjoy the different pace of this movie.

2)  Humor.  Some of the humor is over the top and some of the parts where they were reaching for a laugh will actually have you looking at your neighbor and sighing.  However, if you stick with it, there are a few parts that are actually worth laughing at.  But be prepared, it is a different type of humor that I can imagine many won't understand.

3)  Family Friendly (almost).  For the most part, the women are dressed modestly and there is no cussing.  However, there are some thematic elements (i.e., suicide and corporate scandals) that you might want to be ready to explain to the kids.  Not recommended for really young children.

Negatives

1)  Plot.  Well, the plot of the good-natured person that somebody raises to the top to walk all over them has been done and redone so many times that this just becomes a Hollywood cliche.  However, the plot is also fairly unrealistic.

2)  Easy Way Out.  Okay, it seems that whenever our ""hero"" is in a bind, something pops up unexpectedly that ends up saving the day.  That aspect actually lacks of creativity... which is something we have come to expect from the Coen brothers.  Wait until you see how our Barnes survives slipping on the ledge of a 44/45 story building.

3)  Boring.  Though the people are pretty fast talkers, the pace of the movie is actually pretty slow... as if the creators were trying to find out how to stretch it out into a full-length movie.

4)  Acting.  Oh, the acting is atrocious.  Don't be looking for any academy award acting here (I never looked, but I highly suspect nobody was nominated here).  The acting is waaaaay over the top and distracts from the story being told.

So, you may love it and you may hate it.  I hope I've helped you figure out which group you belong in.  Not recommended to watching in groups as this will not please everybody.",1108857600,7,2028,4.526315789473684

600279,5,6303213650,"A film by the Coen Brothers
""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is the fantastic story of Noville Barnes (Tim Robbins).  Norville is just some poor shmoe looking for work, but he isn't qualified for anything and he has no work experience.  He takes a job as a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries.  We're not sure what they do or what they make, but at a board meeting, we find out the company is posting record profits.  When a man is done with his litany of the company's successes, the chairman, Mr Hudsucker himself, stands up on the long table, starts running, and commits suicide by jumping out the window and falling to his death.
What to do?  The rest of the board needs to be able to purchase a controlling interest in Hudsucker stock, but the stock price is too high.  The formulate a plan to temporarily drive down the stock prices by hiring as president of the company someone so incompetent that shareholders will be so scared that stock prices will plummet.  The dimwit president: Norville Barnes.  It is Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) who is pulling the strings behind the scenes to make all this happen; it is his master plan that sets all this in motion.
Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the fast talking reporter who goes undercover to investigate Norville and find out why Hudsucker would have hired him as the president.  ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is funny in a smart, clever way, and is highly entertaining.  The Coen Brothers do not make ordinary or conventional movies (""Intolerable Cruelty"" aside), but they definitely make some of the top movies of any given year.

The visual style is brilliant, showcasing the Coen brother's ability to make film footage of ordinary settings seem surreal and slightly comic bookish, and they keep it up consistently for the length of a movie.

But he is ambitious. He has a wild business idea represented by a circle on a piece of paper he is given to waving at people. This of course instantly convinces them they are talking to a moron who has just, quite literally, reinvented the wheel. At it later transpires that is not what he has done. A moron, however, is exactly what the boardroom, led by evil Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), wants. Company founding president Waring Hudsucker has just thrown himself to his death from the top floor and his fellow board members learn that the company rules deem his dominant share in the company stock must be put on sale to the general public in the New Year. If only they could get it to fall so low they could buy it themselves. If only they could hire such an idiot as President that shareholder confidence would collapse. At which point who should walk into Mussburger's office to deliver a letter but Barnes...
The result is  quite excellent movie. It's not quite as good as the best of the Coen Brothers later stuff which it often anticipates. Thus it starts out with a voice-over section as the camera sweeps into New York City from a distance, humourously establishing both the place and the central character, that strongly anticipates the opening of ""Big Lebowski"". And it's very evidently inspired by a host of earlier classic American movies in much the way ""Lebowski"" and ""Oh Brother"" were. The ghost of Frank Capra is never very far away. And the most important character I've not yet mentioned, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Amy, the hard boiled journalist who sets out to expose Barnes but ends up as the love interest, is clearly enough based on characters like Rosalind Russell's Hildy Johnson in ""His Girl Friday"". That's another movie this isn't quite as good as. But that again is praising it with faint damnation: most novels, including some great ones, aren't as good as ""Mansfield Park""!

600285,4,6303213650,"After a string of critically acclaimed films it seemed inevitable that the Coens would eventually get slammed by the critics at some point. The Hudsucker Proxy was that film. Criticized for unsuccessfully blending the sensibilities of Frank Capra and Preston Sturges and tagged with a title that the general public did not understand, the film disappeared quickly from theaters.
It's too bad because there is a lot going on in this film. As always, it has the Coens flawless, stunning production values. This was the first film where the boys had a huge budget to play with and boy did they ever put every cent up on the screen. This is a fantastical version of New York City in the '50s -- think Terry Gilliam's Brazil but with all the nightmarish, Orwellian influences.
The film also features the Coens trademark snappy dialogue. Lots of verbal acrobatics and a cast that is more than up for the task. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the stand-out as she morphs effortlessly into Katherine Hepburn with her rapid-fire delivery and very distinctive way of speaking. She is excellent. Tim Robbins, at first, seems like an unlikely guy to play a schlub, a dim-witted patsy. But then take a look at his career-defining performance in Bull Durham to see that the Coens knew exactly what they were doing when they cast him.
Paul Newman is also wonderful as the evil Sidney J. Mussberger (love that name!) and he imparts just the right amount of comical menace.
Fans of Sam Raimi will want to check this one out for two reasons. First, Sam's main man, Bruce Campbell has a significant role as Smitty, an ace reporter who is Leigh's foil throughout the film. It's great to see Campbell in a Coen bros. film -- I wish he'd be in more of 'em! Also, Raimi not only co-wrote the screenplay but he also did the bulk of the second unit work. Check out the famed hula hoop creation sequence. Sam directed that bit. He also has a cameo as one of the guys who thinks up the name Hula Hoop.
This is a really great film that deserves a larger audience. Many people regard this as the Coens weakest film to date but I dunno 'bout that. I love watching this movie and I have fond memories of seeing it on the big screen.

Jennifer Leigh's amalgam of Katharine Hepburn/Rosalind Russell/Jean Arthur (from the 1930s) is priceless. I personally felt Paul Newman was a bit wasted in his role, but that's just me.
However, these performances would be for nothing if it wasn't for the marvellous script- witness the boardroom scenes in which the directors discuss how many floors it was that Mr Hudsucker fell (""not including the mezzanine"") or the scene in which they interrogate Norville about his new invention.

The key word to describing this movie would probably be 'bizarre'. And bizarre it is. The plot is admittabley very original, and the directors (and writers) Joel and Ethan Coen put a certain style into this movie which we don't see very often. Most of the humor is incredibly dry while there is some slapstick involved.
The characters in the film are not your average characters in that they are so obviously two-dimensional but the actors give such a flair into their acting that you can't help but love 'em. Take Tim Robbins as Norville for example, he's totally lovable though he's not actually very birhg or incredibly smart. But I must say that Jennifer Jason Leigh's character Amy Archer is one of the most fascinating characters I've seen. She's a replica of the sassy Katherine Hepburn and as fast-talking as Rosalind Russel in ""His Girl Friday"". She just talk soooooo fast that I recommend you see the movie at least twice to enjoy her dialogue all the more so.

600357,4,6303213650,"The Coen brothers and Samuel Raimi belong to this wave of young american directors that appeared in the eighties and that replaced the John Huston, Richard Brooks and Arthur Penn's generation which slowly retired at that time. Some of these young wolves, like Michael Bay, were more interested in presenting inept pictures without a single ounce of originality while the Coen brothers and Samuel Raimi's movies, with the years passing by, were becoming more and more worthy of the works of their illustrious elders.
In this viewpoint, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY can be watched as an homage to one of the heroes of the Hollywood of the thirties and the forties : Frank Capra. If you're familiar with the movies of the director of NEW-YORK-MIAMI, you'll certainly greatly appreciate THE HUDSUCKER PROXY that presents scenes inspired by such movies as Capra's MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU or MEET JOHN DOE.
If you don't remember or, worse, don't know these movies, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY could seem a little strange at times to you. For instance, the scenes with Bill Cobbs's or with the angel lose totally their impact if you haven't seen the Capra movies. I know, it's not fair but cinema is an art that lives on ashes.

600358,5,6303213650,"Modern fables are not the stuff that make Hollywood movie studio executives see dollar signs. As we can surmise from their dearth in the market, few good ones make it past the initial pitch. So all of us should be surprised when one does filter past the naysayers and make it to the silver screen.
""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is a beautiful fable crafted by those two Hollywood nose-thumbers, Joel and Ethan Coen (""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski""), my picks for best filmmakers of the last fifteen years. In ""Hudsucker"" they give us a magical world that hovers in time between 1930 and 1960 and fills it with Art Deco scenery, hard-bitten reporters, greedy tycoons, innocent rubes, and your favorite Whammo fads.
Our fable begins with the whimsical suicide of Hudsucker Industries' CEO (the always entertaining Charles Durning) and the elevation of a naive mailboy with big dreams, Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), to his position. As scripted by the cigar-smoking corporate spinmeister, Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), Hudsucker will be thrashed by the press for its brazen stupidity, the stock will dive, the board will buy up huge amounts of it, then Mussburger will steer the company back, making everyone rich. But Norville has a better idea.
So does star reporter, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh doing her best Hepburn/Russell), who like her no-holds-barred sibling in ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" wants to get the inside scoop on the new boy in town. Determined to get the best of the hick, she sidles up to him via her new ""job"" as his secretary, only to find his earnestness and honesty a glaring contrast to her own shriveled morality. Soon, unbeknownst to him, he wins her heart.
Soon, too, his new idea for a product sweeps the nation in a fad never before seen, jacking Hudsucker's stock far out of the picture for the now angry board. Determined to stop the record profits, Mussburger engineers a fall for Norville that will surely lead to him taking the permanent plunge, just as the company's namesake did.
But this is a true fable, so the supernatural element enters the picture in a delightfully satisfying way. The holiday theme near the end of the picture adds to the magic, making the picture a warm way to prepare for the season.
Some have accused ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" of being all gloss and no substance, a Frank Capra or Preston Sturges film that is easy on the eye yet lifeless, but I disagree strongly. The massive set design and powerful architecture in the film only serve to highlight the concept of mankind at odds with its own surroundings, good people out of place in a world that is too big for any of them. And that is the point of good fables, that what is real are the people and their courageous, honest, sincere lives, not the settings in which they act out their morality plays.
So forget the horrid title and buy ""The Hudsucker Proxy"". And for those that are fans of great production and set design, folks, this is how it is done. Fans of fables will not be left unsatisfied, either.

""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is my favorite Coen movie, specially because of the inclusion of Sam Raimi as co-writer. This film was the first big-studio production for the Coen Brothers, and it has everything that makes them  ""one"" of the biggest names in independent film-making. It deals with a very difficult genre of comedy, that which is fast-talking and very witty. In fact, there may be a few jokes that you'll only get after you see the movie a couple of times. It's so full of details and symbols that you'll have a great time trying to see them all. It's also the most ambitious art direction the Coens ever had. Too bad that such a great movie doesn't have a decent DVD edition, one with (at least) a couple of features to separate it from the rest of the pack.
Oh, I almost forgot, watch out for some really cool cameo appearances like Sam Raimi, Peter Ghalaguer and Anna Nicole Smith (as Zsa Zsa Gabor) and Steve Buscemi.",1024272000,3,1089,4.472361809045226

Although technically set in 1959, this is a 1940s style movie, especially reminiscent of Capra's works.  Almost everything about the work is brilliant, starting with Tim Robbins as a naive man thrust into a figurehead position at the top of a giant corporation and Paul Newman as the coldly ruthless business who put him there.  The settings are fantastic, some of the scenes are especially funny (I particulary like the ""blue letter"" sequence), and the story is enjoyable from start to finish.

600362,5,6303213650,"""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is one of the movies at the top of my ""most underrated movies of all time"" list. Besides being a wonderfully unique creation, it features top rate performances from its two stars, Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh.
A comedic love story at is core, ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" takes on a lot of big issues in its own quirky way. The meaning of identity, the harshness of the world, the nature of creativity, and the evil of deception are all dealt with. Providential aid comes from the least likely source.
Leigh's interpretation of Ms. Archer is near perfect. She is humorous, unassured, witty, and fumbling all at the same time. The same could be said of Robbins, yet everything about Norville is driven by the fumbling part of his character.
Newman's Sidney is a scheming heartless antagonist. He is so evil that one can almost see the slime behind his eyes. Yet even the schemes of Sidney fall short due to incompetence.
At this point I must also mention that the Master, Bruce Campbell, makes an appearance in ""The Hudsucker Proxy."" Maybe the movie's greatest weakness is that his role is too limited. Then again, Campbell never gets enough screen time.
Whatever else one can say about The Coen brothers and Tim Robbins, this much is sure--they make great films. ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is one of the greatest films any of them has made. I recommend it highly.",1018051200,3,1381,4.734439834024896
600363,5,6303213650,"The Coens' Masterwork merits a place in the upper echelon of hysteria and oblique humour.  The near cameo placement of Bruce Campbell is a wonderful homage, and my only regret is the utterly overplayed role of Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Her character's treatment is admirable but the vocal 240 wpm is a bit grating at times.  Notice Steve Buscemi survives an appearance in a Coen Bros. film also!  His hepcat/beatster bartender is in no way murdered!  Go figure.  Robbins is as always, delightful, and Paul Newman is in high form and cast perfectly as the embodiment of corporate greed with Hudsucker Industries.  The plot of ""use and discard a substitute to plummet stock value and swoop in and buy company on the ...[low cost]-gone wrong"" is most definitely entertaining.  And the narration breaks are fantastic, probably the best edited film of the mid-90's.  A must have for any connisuer of the Coens.  A great New Years flick (for obvious reasons) that sort of hearkens back to the days of William Powell and the Thin Man series.  Only our hero is a paradoxical ""genius""; not a decisive, witty highball swilling madman.  Watch it twice for the subtleties.",1017360000,,1157,4.876923076923077

After despondent C.E.O. Werring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) throws himself off the 44th floor, the conniving V.P., Sidney J. Mussberger (Paul Newman at his shrewd best) and the rest of the Board have to move fast to steal the stock before it goes public. So they decide to crash the stock by promoting new mailmroom clerk and schmuck Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins, in yet another great performance) to President. Unfortunately for the Board, Barnes has a few tricks up his sleeve. Unfortunately for Barnes, Jennifer Jason Leigh's fast-talking reporter is hot on his trail
Dazzling cinematography from Roger Deakins, wonderful production design emulating the 50s and the 30s, and a rich, textured score by Carter Burwell and well-done special effects (in a Coen bros. movie??) all contribute to make this a wonderful, thoroughly entertaining film.
Think of Preston Sturges directing a Horatio Alger story crossed with Terry Gilliam and you'll have an inkling of how good this film is. Should have won Oscars in 1994 (along with Red & Quiz Show, and Pulp Fiction) instead of Gump, but them's the breaks.

600445,5,6303213650,"Though certainly not the best Coen brothers movie, ""Hudsucker""  is my personal favorite if only for the ""aw shucks, ma'am"" innocence of Robbins' character.  Terrific performances from everyone in the cast - Tim Robbins as the wide-eyed optimist with a dream (""You know...for kids!""), Paul Newman, as the irascible, single-minded corporate tiger, Jennifer Jason-Leigh as the fast-talking ""career gal"" reporter, John Mahoney as her even faster-talking editor (their scenes together, among others, bring to mind another great newsroom comedy, ""His Girl Friday""), Jim True as the elevator boy straight out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon, and Bill Cobbs as the wise old seer who sees all but says little.  Even cameos delight in flash performances from Peter Gallagher as the Dean Martin-ish 'Vic Tenetta', crooning to adoring fans with drink in hand, to Anna Nicole Smith (yes, THAT Anna Nicole Smith) as sex kitten Za-Za.  ""Evil Dead"" Director Sam Raimi makes an appearance in the brainstorming scene, but you'll only see his silhouette and hear his voice, and ED star Bruce Campbell gets his share of beatings from Leigh as her charming, but sexist newspaper buddy Smitty.
Almost everything about this movie will make you smile or laugh, but the real star of the movie is the dialog, a throwback to the good old days of screwball comedies when smart and confident writing and delivery was a must.  The DVD is good quality, but doesn't have any of the extra stuff - the Coens are obviously movie lovers who've  been influenced by many different genres and styles, so an audio track from them would've been perfect - but you can't have everything.  All in all, a delightful, lyrical morality tale that will whet your appetite for more Coen fare - and with gems out there like ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Blood Simple"", you won't have far to look.",1011484800,2,1890,4.962025316455696
600446,5,6303213650,"I think I have figured out why the quality of this film is so heavily disputed: It is a comedy without jokes. Everything onscreen, from the characters to the sets to--especially to--the dialogue is so incredibly amusing that many folks cannot seem to comprehend what the film is doing. I'll enlighten those who have yet to enjoy the majesty of this film: It isn't cracking mundane, vulgar, stereotypical gags like every other film, it is reinventing humor, redesignating what is funny, what it takes to make the audience laugh. You can't watch five minutes of this film and find it humorous, because everything about it is an experiment in new and interesting ways to amuse a crowd; obviously they can't please everyone, but for me the film has become my all time favorite comedy.
Humor, as defined by the Coens, is more obscure than you or your Webster's considers it. For them, humor is an all encompassing showcase that cannot be taken apart into simple categories of performance, and script, and intelligence--and yet all three of these succeed well beyond most other films, as the Coen brothers are perhaps the most inventive in the industry today. Because the funny aspect of the Hudsucker Proxy lies in a perfect amalgamation of every element of the film, it disappoints those people who are looking for ""one moment in time; so they can say right here, right now; this is it."" With the Coens, this is impossible, since it is always about the sum of the parts rather than the integrity of a single aspect at a single moment.
But even beyond the humor of this film, I cannot help but praise it incessantly. Visually, as usual, it sets a stunning image, achieving a style that is entertaining in itself. The dialogue, whether you consider it funny or not, can be deemed nothing but intelligent and witty. The performances are dead-on and borderline eccentric/absurd, for what the Coen brothers are famous. The direction is always superb--and proof positive that even the direction plays a major role in the ""jokes"" of the Hudsucker Proxy, watch the camera during the Lounge Singers performance; the single greatest shot in the film has no dialogue and not even one of the main characters, and yet it punctuates the intended frivolity of the entire picture.
Some have commented that the viewer has little affection for the characters. To everyone their own, but MY own is that I TOO heartily fall in love with these characters. Tim Robbins is the clumsy everyman that any humbled human will see in himself; Jennifer Jason Leigh is our ambition, and tragic despite the darker side of her story. I'd go even so far as to say I like Paul Newman's character, whom despite the evil way in which he is portrayed, models our lowest and greediest selves. And so, while many contest the characters to be too inconsequential, I say they are the driving force, relating the viewer to himself in new and impossible ways amidst a superbly entertaining script. Again, some call the script pointless, but truth be told, I find this plot to be more well developed than most of the Coen brothers' other works.
And through all of these traits, Hudsucker takes the cake as my favorite comedy of all time. There is just something incredibly inventive, humorous, and intelligent in every single shot, every single word, every single expression and mannerism that the talented cast, crew, and filmmakers have put on the screen. There is a gift in everything to be witnessed, as every individual part is perfect--and perfectly implemented, since the final product far exceeds the sum of its parts. In short, from the minutest detail to the overall scheme, everything about this film pleases in new and unexpected ways that intend to spoof--and appear to--but really reinvent what it means to make a comedy. Take care to pay close attention to what this film offers, as I hope others take note and observe the magic it possesses; The Future is Now!",1007769600,6,3927,4.819259259259259

600448,5,6303213650,"I still don't understand the disapproval of even Coen fans to this movie. What's so wrong with it? It's classic 50's-era screwball comedy, with beautiful visuals and a feel good atmospehere. I consider Tim Robbins a great actor (and director) after seeing this, the Shawshank Redemption, Bob Roberts, and The Player. The sweeping score is moving, and elevates the action on the screen in a new height.
It begins on an anynomonous note, and ends on a more happy note. The usual 'substance over story' quote used for the Coens is wrong; their writing isn't like other films. It can be deadpan and odd, and it's perfect as it is. It's astonishing that it only made two million (!) dollars at the box office - while Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink made more at a limited theater run (I guess it's understandable. Both films are better).
It still deserves more of a widespread audience.",1005436800,3,883,4.740259740259741
600449,4,6303213650,"In The Hudsucker Proxy the Coen brothers tackle the genre of classic American studio-produced comedy. It talks like the 30's, looks like the 40's and is set in a 50's New York that only exists as the workplace. The film, like any film by the Coens, is populated with characters that feel like they're something less than wholly human. The directors push their characters toward emulating the past's character actors with such uncanny precision that they become misshapen. None of these characters has a home or a life outside the workplace. The film, which follows the rise and fall of a mailroom clerk (Tim Robbins) that lives and creates the American dream, exists entirely within the tight sphere of its genre, and to stop to suggest more would only detract from the overall, streamlined effect.
In my opinion, The Hudsucker Proxy is the closest the Coen brothers have come to creating a mission statement. It's a clever satire of the phoniness of the studio system's product that simultaneously seems to be celebrating it (or, perhaps, its ability to expose its own falseness). There's such a corporate cleanliness and symmetry to the film that one suspects the brothers' main target is assembly line, Hollywood-ized narrative itself. It's probably not coincidental that this film was the first Coen brothers film with a significant budget (over $30 million). The film's key sequence, and perhaps the key to understanding all of the Coens' work, is one in which a female reporter's (Jennifer Jason Leigh - channeling Katherine Hepburn and Rosalind Russell) investigations into what makes the Hudsucker Company tick take on a bold literal dimension. She meets Moses, a black custodian (a part that would feel racist if not for the film's satiric bent) that tends to the firm's oversized clock. The keeper of the machinery, he is the only person that understands the events as they transpire. He explains to Leigh's reporter the circularity of the situation and predicts the outcome of the events. The assertion here is that these characters act as they do because they've been programmed like machine parts to do so in order to achieve the film's desired outcome. In this film, which has been programmed so that the little guy will ""win"", he isn't even free to lose, since the story is ultimately being told by the big guys - complete with their biases, stereotypes, and rigid sense of class structure. They've been getting rich off of selling the little guy a simpleminded, counterfeit dream that he eats up time and again. Worse yet, many little guys are tricked into thinking the big guy's version of their dreams is actually their dream. When the film closes with Moses' narration, his knowledge of another, similar, story that took place on an even higher floor that this one did sounds like nothing less than a threat.
It's rare to see such directness in a Coen brothers production, as they usually seem somewhat aloof about their motives. This film seems to be the key to understanding their work as a whole. Every head whip and hand swing of Leigh's character has to be accompanied by a whooshing sound because that's the requirement of the genre taken to its full extreme. They pump up the falseness inherent in this sort of character stereotype until it reaches its breaking point. In some of their films, such as O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the bubble breaks revealing nothing profound underneath the faade. In their better films like this one, and The Big Lebowski, their best film, they manage to make that core of hollowness a reprimand to the ideals that the film's very specific time and place represent. Here, Hollywood's corporate perception of the American dream being a direct function of ingenuity and hard work seems to be the target. The inevitability of the story's outcome and the pre-destined happiness of its stars both feel like arbitrary rules a cruel game. And cruelly, at the film's end, there's little implication that the future holds anything but more of the same.",1005350400,58,4001,4.920118343195266

600454,4,6303213650,"Ok, ok, the title of the movie stinks and probably contributed to the movie hitting the basement, as soon as it was released. Still, it is a pretty clever and unusual movie. The premise is simple. The CEO and founder of a very successful, major corporation commits suicide. Consequently, his shares of the corporation must be sold publicly. To the dismay of the board of directors, this means that more than half the company will be owned by outsiders.
 Corporate executive, Sidney Mussberger, wonderfully played by the ever handsome Paul Newman, devises a fiendish scheme to devalue the shares of the corporation. He will simply hire a numbskull and esconce him as the new CEO in order to drive the company temporarily into the ground, causing the value of the shares to plummet. The board of directors can then afford to buy the outstanding shares floating out there at rock bottom prices, retaining control of the corporation.
 Sidney subsequently selects Norville Barnes, a dopey, but nice guy, played with cow eyed innocence by Tim Robbins, who works in the company mailroom, a place reminiscent of the movie Metropolis. Barnes happens to have an idea that he has been working on for years. When he shows a picture of a circle as representative of his idea, the viewer wonders just what the heck is so special about it.  So does Sidney, who allows Barnes to execute his idea, believing him to be a total moron whose idea is just the thing to make the companies stock tank.  This is where the Coen Brother's cleverness begins to kick in. When the viewer realizes what that circle actually is, the movie will be kicking into full gear. It is, at times, hilarious. See the film to find out just what Barnes has been working on for years. Sidney learns that the best laid plans often go awry.
 Barnes becomes enamored of Amy Archer, a female reporter, who smells that something is not quite right at corporate headquarters. The role is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh in an over the top, highly stylized, uneven parody of Katherine Hepburn. Still, she makes this affectation work in the context of this film. In fact, the rat-a-tat-tat tempo of her delivery contributes to giving the film its feel of a bygone time. The action in the film purportedly takes place in the nineteen fifties, but the sets are nineteen thirties art nouveau in feel and style, as is the rapid fire delivery of some of the dialogue. This creates an odd, somewhat disconcerting, dissonanace, contributing to the film's overall quirkiness.

They were trying to create an old style screwball comedy. They achived this with flying colors.  The dialouge is classic--you would almost think Robert Riskin (writer of Frank Capra's It Happened One Night) rose from the dead and helped the write the script.  The way this movie is planned out is ingenious.  It's not the same old boring camera follows the people and it just happens.  For example, two cabbies sitting across from  Amy Archer and Norville Barnes are telling this scene between them as it goes along.  This gives the film a very kenetic feeling, not a static feel like practically all other films have.  The Coens used the movie camera and the medium of film to it's fullest extent, like Orson Welles did in 'Citizen Kane'.  Not only is this movie the Coens' crowning achievement in script writting and filmmaking, it's funny!  The Coens' experiment with physical comedy as well as verbal.  The costumes, set design, and art direction of this picture are picture-perfect.  You feel as if it's 1958 all over again.  The cinematography of this film is exceptionally marvelous.  Sweeping camera actions and dramatic lighting  move the film along with it's plot.  My favorite element about the film is the dialouge and the old time way that people used to talk.  The Coens' captured this in a way that no other  new film has ever captured.  This movie is one of the best new films I have ever seen and it's good for all ages and will live forever like the screwball classics.

Money can't always buy happiness is the very true moral of this big budget Hollywood production. The storyline of the Hudsucker Proxy is built around highly successful CEO, Waring Hudsucker taking his own life even though his company, Hudsucker Industries is at its peak. This is where the carefully planed Coen brother plot kicks into full swing. In accordance with company policy the 65% of the company in which Hudsucker owned must be floated to the open market. The board of directors shudders at the very sound that more than half the company will be owned by any Tom, Dick or Harry anywhere in the world. At the current rate per stock, no member of the board can afford to purchase more than 1% of the company, so Sidney Mussenberger develops a devilishly clever scheme to create a panic sell off. Thus devaluing the stock to the price of an average bag of peanuts.
Norville Barnes, played by Tim Robbins, is a slow-witted Muncie boy who soon finds himself in the midst of Sidney's plan. With no prior experience or any decent qualifications he lands in the mailroom where a complete mockery of bureaucy takes place. Tim Robbins maximises the character in his dynamic style to present us with a dim-witted, fast talking and good-natured character. There are lots of little twists and turns, which keep you coming back for more!
Being a Coen brother's production from scripting to production, you can expect the highest quality film production, not a paper-thin Hollywood potato. Many techniques have been used in this film that have never been seen in other film production which will make the technology acquired in this film the basis for other movies. As with many films of this sort, it's not the story that makes it a good film, its how the story is told.

Hilarious parody of big business, this film is one for the whole family!

600528,3,6303213650,"I had heard lots of good things about ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" and last night when I was planning to stay up all night (making the transition to a night shift) I decided to pick it up from the local Blockbuster. By 3:00 am I really wished I could pack it in and go to bed, so that may have influenced my perception of the movie.
It definitely had its moments, and some excellent performances, especially Newman's turn as Sid Mussburger, the conniving executive who masterminds the installation of a puppet president after Waring Hudsucker makes an impressive exit and leaves the post vacant. But it seems everything about this film was over the top, from the visual style to the performances of Tim Robins and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The film is set in the late '50s but stylistically has more to do with films of the '30s, which I found disconcerting. After awhile, Leigh's non-stop patter began to grate. Given all of this, the movie's ham-fisted plot devices didn't stick out too sorely. Maybe I just need to see the film again when I'm not strung out from lack of sleep, but my first impression is that ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is a movie with hints of genius that get lost in all of the commotion.
Regarding the DVD itself, it includes both wide screen and pan & scan versions. There is no bonus material, and dialogue was difficult to hear against the rest of the soundtrack, even with dialogue enhancement turned on.

600529,5,6303213650,"Woah!  I was blown away when I first saw this on TNT late one night.  I now own the video, soundtrack, screenplay, and even a hoola hoop because I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!  Everything in this movie is magical: the sets, the dialogue, the characters, the music...... everything.  The Coen Brothers' second best film, in my opinion (right after Fargo).  If you want an incredibly surreal, fun, ""what the?"" afternoon, watch this movie.  Don't expect anything but to be entertained.",980726400,2,478,4.839506172839506
600530,5,6303213650,"THe Coen Brothers are absolutely perfect, i have given 5 stars to every movie they have made, except blood simple, and hudsucker is no exception. This is not necessarily a typical Coen movie, it has more of a whymsical and humorous side to it than the usual dark humour. This movie is closer to Raising Arizona or O brother where art thou. THIS IS NOT LIKE FARGO OR THE BIG LEBOWSKI, there is no swearing or graphic violence, I believe the movie is only pg. So i love the movie and it has a ton of memorable dialogue in it. Each character almost lives i ntheir own little universe, and the whole film is filled with wit and snappy dialogue. Not a drama, not a hilarious comedy, not action, not adventure. I don't know how to classify this film. It may prove to slow for some, becasue of the lack of action or hilarity. I'd say it moves like the Big Lebowski, scenes are full of talking and everything falls together nicely.
 AS for the DVD the film looks great, not phenomenal but better than a regular DVD, hell i would even call it semi phenominal. Plus it gives the option of full or widescreen...yeah! THe sound is fine, not mindblowing, but it doesn't drown out voices with the music and everything blends together well. What extras... not even a trailer. Fantastic movie with a great transfer on a bare bones dvd, but it's only 16.99",979689600,3,1339,4.443089430894309
600531,4,6303213650,"The Movie:
It's boffo, fab, the real deal and a steal at that.  Norville Barnes (Robbins) plays a rube sucker (?) new to business in the big city who finds a job in the basement mailroom of Hudsucker Industries, Inc just as Waring Hudsucker, founder & CEO takes a swan-dive from the 44th floor (not counting the mezannine).  In need of a dupe-CEO to depress the stock so they can suck up the Hud's shares, Executive Sid Mussberger (Newman) and the board install the Rube as CEO.  But he's got a plan.  You know, for kids!  Amy Archer (Leigh) is the hard-nosed investigative reporter lookin' for a scoop.
The movie itself rolls along really well.  You have to stay on your toes to catch some of the best rapid-fire dialogue since The Big Sleep.  Leigh, whom I usually despise, is excellent.  All the stars really play the hell out of their roles.  The Coens' writing and direction is top-drawer.  All this and it's clean enough to watch with the kids!
The DVD:
There is really nothing but the movie here - no cast filmography, nocommentary, nada, except french dubbing if you want that.  This is an older-style 2-sided DVD with standard on one side and widescreen on the other, which I find annoying.  Despite other complaints I didn't see any profound problems with the transfer, but then again I'm just a film-lover, not a home theater freak.  If you love this movie it's a good addition.",978912000,20,1389,4.597560975609756
600532,4,6303213650,"This movie features a brilliant storyline, and being directed by the same filmmakers who would later bring us 'The Big Lebowski', it was sure to please.  The movies fast-paced style is a very pleasant change from the  average fare on the market today.  This is a movie to buy, because you will  want to see it over and over again.  My one complaint is that the DVD  version doesn't provide any ""extras"", and as stated before the  quality is only mediocre...I was definetly expecting more from this.  But  all-in-all, it is a must-have for your DVD collection!",965001600,2,559,4.680412371134021

All in all, this movie was classified as some  sort of dissapointment at the time of it's rlease. Sure, it can be called  clumsy or cliche&eacute;d. I mean, the plot doesn't seem so stunning at first. But  there are again some little things that make this movie so brilliant. It  can be seen as a critisation for the over-commecilaity, but more than  anything iti is a fars. and a dam funny movie. Casting is also brilliant (  for example, watch Jennifer Jason-Leigh!), and the photography - oh the  photography!

600584,5,6303213650,"I like this movie. From the acting to the cinematography, this movie is a breath of fresh air. Just when you think you got it pegged, you find it you were wrong.
A movie about the rise from the mailroom to the 44th floor  (45th counting the mezzanine) and how the seemingly imbecilic Norville  Barnes (Tim Robbins) manages to succeed and then fail. He is assisted in  his failure by a devious board of directors  who, as fate would have it,  are also the cause of his success.
As I said, the cinematography is great  in this movie. Accompany this with a great script, terrific characters and  an outstanding soundtrack and you have a sure winner. This is not a  juvenile comedy and it is refreshing to be entertained with adult humor.  This movie will definitely withstand multiple viewings.
Once you see  this movie you will understand the title for this review. As said in other  reviews, the DVD only offers the movie and language options. There are no  special features or cast bios.",957571200,4,987,4.609195402298851

600586,2,6303213650,"I was about to give this three stars, but seeing how clumsily the previous reviewers have overrated this film (several couldn't spell the directors'  name correctly, one suggests it's set in the 40s, and another claims the  Robbins character ""makes it to the top"" when he does no such  thing), I decided to bust it to two as a corrective.  I find anything the  Coens make to be worth checking out, but to put this ahead of  ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" and even  ""Barton Fink"" (not to mention ""Raising Arizona""), as  one reviewer does, is just silly.
""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is one  of the more interesting failures I've seen in a while. It plays with genres  (parody to farce to melodrama to fantasy), vocal accents (Jennifer Jason  Leigh is all over the map), music (mix in a little Khatchaturian and  Bizet), pacing (sometimes the dialogue races at breakneck speeds, other  times the camera takes forever to pull back), and time periods (a tribute  to screwball romances and Wall Street/journalism comedies of the 30s and  40s, the movie is explicitly set in the final month of 1958 but visually  occupies some no-time that straddles several decades).
The plot and  acting are but so-so at best. (My wife guessed and announced one of the  central plot twists, something about the blue letter, a good hour before it  happened; don't you just hate when that happens?)  Although it's supposedly  December in New York, there are a number of scenes with sunshine and people  in shirtsleeves.  Robbins is decent in a wide-eyed innocent role that  demands little (he's had enough of those -- ""Erik the Viking"" was  sufficient); Jason Leigh overacts wildly but looks great; the romance  between the two is utterly unbelievable, especially from her point of view;  Newman provides gruff fun but doesn't have a lot to do either.  Someone has  noted Buscemi's cameo; there's also a surprising one by Peter Gallagher  (the husband in ""sex, lies & videotape"" and the supersalesman  in ""American Beauty"") as a swing band crooner.
What makes this  movie exciting are the inventive camera work (running feet almost punching  the lens as they sprint forward; more than one 44-foot suicide plunge;  newsreel pastiches) and especially the set design (love that boardroom  table, and the hula hoop warehouse).  These are primarily what I would have  awarded a third star for.",954979200,8,2368,4.933842239185751
600587,4,6303213650,"The Hudsucker Proxy is one of my favorite movies of all time. I won't go over what's so great about it because you can get all that just as well by reading the other reviews on this page.
I do want to address the quality  of the DVD, however. While the DVD does offer both standard and widescreen  mode (anamorphic, no less), it decidedly comes across as a sub-par job. The  transfer is terrible, dark and grainy in places and completely washed-out  in others (the dancing scene made me wonder if something was wrong with my  player). The sound is in Dolby stereo rather than the 5.1 channel surround  just about everything post-1990 is available in. Not to mention the  complete lack of extras: no actor bios, commentary (which I would have  really liked to have seen) -- not even a theatrical trailer. For a movie of  this quality, I would have expected a lot more.
I love this movie, so I  got it anyway and am happy with it (after all, it won't deteriorate like  VHS). But don't expect a Matrix quality disk or anything.",950832000,45,1024,4.451612903225806

600589,5,6303213650,"I am sorry to say that this is my favourite film of all time - sorry, because it is a hard thing for someone who has such a various taste in books and music to have an absolute favourite in another medium...but this  little work of art is precisely that, with superb acting by Tim Robbins,  Jennifer Jason Leigh and Paul Newman, plus an excellent supporting cast. I  suppose I should worship the Coen brothers, whom I praise non-stop when  Fargo or the Big Lebowski are mentioned (the latter with a bit more  restraint).
But this film...it is different from anything else I have  seen. Although set in the 40's/50's, it does not really seem to have any  location in time or geography - just some American city, some foolish  genius, and some misguided corporate individuals. Kind of Monty Python  mixed with Shawshank Redemption, the Sting and Some Like It Hot mixed in  for good measure. If that means anything - enjoy!",948758400,2,920,4.6234567901234565

Jennifer Jason Leigh is charming and of  course who wouldn't adore Paul Newman as a crusty old exec.

The DVD isn't of great quality, though. The first hint comes from the fact that  ""Ethan"" (as in ""Coen"") is spelled ""Ethen"" in  the jewel case's blurb. As soon as you begin watching, you'll notice the  graininess in the opening shots, and some jaggies during a pan from Tim  Robbins on the ledge. The DVD is ok from then on, until you get to the  dancing sequence with the white background. So, the disc is a hack job  (maybe that explains the low price, too), but the movie is so well done you  can overlook it for all but about 10 seconds.",935366400,38,685,4.388888888888889

7841122,5,6303213650,"The elites must have been suffering from Coen fatigue when this flick was released in 1994.  Generally dismissed by the critics as too stylized and derivative of the Coens earlier work this one did barely a ripple.  If any film is due for rediscovery this is it.  The Coens along with Sam Raimi collaborating on the script, ergo Bruce Campbell in a bit part, craft a work that melds screwball with absurdity.  That said this has to be one of the brothers more optimistic works and it even contains a dash of spirituality.  ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is a cautionary tale that ultimately champions ingenuity and the drive to succeed in a harsh landscape.  There is a certain degree of cynicism at play here but ultimately good prevails over evil.  If ever a flick champions the American way of life this is it.  Tim Robbins is careful not to overplay the hayseed foisted into the mean streets of Manhattan hitting all the right notes.  Jennifer Jason Leigh was criticized at the time for channeling Katherine Hepburn but now it seems appropriate to the role.  Julianne Moore got the same treatment for her work as Maude Lebowski.  Paul Newman!  Was this guy the greatest American actor of all time or what?  In a rare heavy role Newman chews the Monte Christo with relish without chewing the scenery.  Newman was such an intuitive thespian that you would have thought he was born into the Coen universe.  I just loved the casting of the bit parts and extras.  Where did they find those faces?  I think this flick was a hangover from the disappointment of ""Barton Fink"".  The Coens would be resurrected with ""Fargo"" and the subsequent masterworks ""The Big Lebowski"", and O Brother Where Art Thou?"".  See this one and you will agree that it is a piece with those gems.",1520121600,,1760,4.6558441558441555

The latter seem to be the majority, and that comes as little surprise. It helps to know that  ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is basically a wink and a nod to the work of legendary director Frank Capra (""It's a wonderful life""). On the other hand, the film does not only pay tribute to Capra's films but also parodies them - the resulting mixture is strange, eccentric and feels, as many critics remarked, strangely devoid of true emotion. To film enthusiasts with a soft spot for movies from an age long gone by, ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is compulsory watching, if you're just looking for a run-of-the-mill comedy, you should brace yourself for a number of surprises.",1517788800,,773,4.6838235294117645

I love the fast-talking and back-and-forth in the dialogue.  It is an incredible script, both thoughtful and well thought out.  Tim Robbins, Paul Newman, and Jennifer Jason Leigh (I know not everyone loves her performance in this, but I really enjoyed it) all performed excellently.  Actors with smaller parts, from Bill Cobb and Jim True to Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney, each turn in great performances as well that add to the texture of the piece.

It's an artful homage to the Frank Capra formula of ""little guy makes good"" story, of Norville Barnes, who comes from small town (and simpleton) roots and makes it to the top in a Big City firm.

The film is often times operatic in its matching of score and visuals.  This is seen in the opening scene as the camera slow tracks toward a 1950's era skyrise as the slow gentle music follows it.  Also, there is a ""set-piece"" series of scenes (describing the birth of the hoola hoop) that matches Aram Khachaturian's Sabre Dance to a visual tour d' force that focuses on the ""production"" of the hoola hoop and how a group of school kids (and one cute kid in particular) respond to its marketing.  There are other places where the music and scenes work very well with each other to increase the charm of this film
