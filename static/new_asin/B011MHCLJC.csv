7337382,5,B011MHCLJC,"This film feels like a Bond Film directed by Alfred Hitchcock who was offered Dr. No a year earlier. It is very suspenseful, much more realistic then any of the other films in this series, a great gadget, a very good sense of humor, Robert Shaw as a bad guy, and Sean Connery as James Bond. Only Goldfinger tops this in the series. The one right below it, I think would be Goldeneye",1455494400,,382,4.2465753424657535
7337383,5,B011MHCLJC,"From Russia With Love, 1964 film

It begins in a garden. A man is stalking James Bond. He uses a garrote and is timed. Then a mask is removed! The credits are superimposed on a dancer. Next its Venice for a chess championship. Spectators watch a game; white wins. SPECTRE wants to steal a Lektor coding machine. Kronstein has a fool-proof plan to trap James Bond. That killer lies on a lawn in the sun and gets a massage; he gets his orders. Tatiana Romanova [the family name of the Tsars] reports to Colonel Khleb [Bread] for her important assignment. Bond receives a summons from work. He must go to Istanbul to meet Tatiana and get that machine. He is issued a trick attache case. He arrives and passwords verify his drive. Then he inspects the paintings in his hotel room

There is a ruse to cause conflict. Bond is shown a periscope that can look into the Soviet Embassy. Krylenko is in town, he is a killer. A young woman performs a belly dance. A guard isn't vigilant and pays for it. Two girls will fight over a man. [Where is Jerry Stinger?] There is a sudden attack by men with pistols! They are repulsed, both sides take casualties. They will go after Krylenko next. Bond has an AR-5 survival rifle which fits into a compact case. Back at his hotel room Bond finds a present. Tanya greets him. A two-way mirror allows photography. The next day Bond visits Hagia Sofia as a tourist. He sees another man. Who did it? It all seems too easy. Bond boards a ferry boat in Istanbul harbor and meets Tanya. She describes the machine. How many keys? HQ accepts the description, it is genuine, the mission will proceed.

There is a big noise for a distraction, Bond enters the code room to retrieve the Lektor and escape with Tanya. They rush to a train, but a man recognizes Tanya! They are on their way to England. [An airplane ride would eliminate any threat.] Something happens on the train. Karim Bey had many friends. Bond questions Tanya. The train arrives at Belgrade. Bond meets a contact and asks for help. Next stop Zagreb. Will Bond meet the right contact? Mr. Nash arrives late. Did he order the right wine with fish? Nash directs Bonds view to a map. There is a surprise. Nash talks to Bond about his exploits and explains the plot (he has an anger management problem). Will he take gold coins for cigarette? There is a fight. Will Nash get the point?

There is an unscheduled stop to let two passengers out. A small helicopter attacks a truck. Can that AR-5 save Bond? [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop bad guys with a helicopter.] They board a motorboat and head to Venice. Back at SPECTRE there is a penalty for failure - a very early retirement. [Why blame the planner rather than the operator?] There is a motor boat chase for action. A flare gun sets a gasoline drum afire. [Believable?] The pursuers break off their chase. There is an incident in a hotel room, a cleaning lady makes a mess. Bond and Tanya ride in a boat in Venice. Mission accomplished!

After fifty years it is still a good movie (as long as you don't question some of the events). Note the mixture of action and humor. The Bond stories are similar to the old private detective stories but with more action and a bigger budget. [The Charlie Chan movies often used foreign locales for its stories.] Ian Fleming was more than an author of adventure novels; read his biography. Bonds physique is like that of an office worker rather than modern action heroes. The name Rosa Khleb seems like a pun on Bread and Roses.",1454112000,3,3509,4.46801872074883
