3176826,5,B00181RD4G,"A great movie combining 2 genres that have never been combined before. Werewolves and prison movies. Normally when you have a women in prison film it's a non-stop beat up the girl movie, but now you add the fact that the victim can transfor into a homicidal super powered wolf and the odds on the sadistic prison guards is not so good. A great film with great effects. Plenty of gore for all of the gorehounds but it also has a great story attached to it. It has parts that are an homage to ""An American Werewolf in London"" but is not ripping it off. Well worth getting and seeing.",1212451200,9,581,4.290909090909091

3176828,4,B00181RD4G,"Werewolf in a Women's Prison is without a doubt the best werewolf film set in a women's prison that I've seen in recent memory. Victoria De Mare is fantastic in the film and lends credibility to a lot of campy dialogue, as well as many outrageous plot devices- many of which seem to involve various scenarios where she has her clothing stolen. This seems to happen quite a lot in the film. Not knowing a lot about the current issues facing female correctional institutions around the globe, it's hard for me to say whether on not this is a political statement on the part of the filmmakers regarding real-life human rights issues in third-world prisons or not, but it definitely seems as though most of the other characters in the film are very intent that Ms. DeMare's naked body should almost always be on display... to the point that they seem to be ignoring more important issues at hand, for example their obvious werewolf problem. I think if they'd focused more on werewolves and less on breasts, many of the characters in Werewolf in a Women's Prison would probably have survived- but as is demonstrated in the film, their obsessive desire to get Victoria De Mare naked and keep her naked was their ultimate undoing.",1426377600,,1223,4.693023255813953

This one had all the right elements, even, Euro cult hunky Star, Domiziano Arcangeli, with an hispanic/american accent! Ha! He actually plays the warden with gusto!
And, gorgeous porno stars, like Yurizan Beltran, acting so amazingly bad, it's funny, or a few tacky, but great scream queens of insanely genius. And then more boobs, some cuties like Meredith Salenger and Eva Derrek.. you name it!
Some great, terrific SFX! Some scenes that not even in the sleaziest Euro Trash most famous gore fest's!
All together, a demented guilty pleasure and a thrilling ride!
Jeff Leroy shows how you can make a real fun movie,how to deliver a really gory and well made product with little.

3176832,3,B00181RD4G,"I saw this film when it came out. I was at a fantasy type fair in San Jose CA. I met the director and I think the babe star was there too. Don't remember if I got her autograph.

I liked this film. It delivers as an exploitation, cheap horror film. Gorgeous scantily clad women running for their lives. Horror, guts and gore and girls; what's not to like?

There is some original themes. The babe's dead boyfriend appears to her with advice about the life beyond and her bad situation. The bad guy prison warded surprises us by trying to squeeze a dollar out of a novel situation.

And instead of growing hairy with time lapse photography, so 1960's, the werewolf pops out of a second skin cocoon! That was something new for me.

3176833,5,B00181RD4G,"In the beginning, a woman's boyfriend is killed by a werewolf when they're both out camping. She kills the creature, but is also bitten. Accused of his murder, she's put in a women's prison. She's visited by the ghost of her boyfriend (this part is similar to AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON) who warns her that she'll become a werewolf. Obviously, she becomes the creature during a full moon and begins tearing people apart in extreme gore sequences; this is made mainly for nudity and gore. This film also has one thought in mind, and that's to put as much entertainment in its running time as possible.  The pace (with the exception of maybe some small parts earlier on) is really fast, and I thought that the film never got boring; and the women are good looking also.  The film is low-budget, but the gore effects are really well done considering its budget and most of them are very extreme.  There's tons of gore and the werewolf looks great for a low budget film, and there's also a lot of nudity; the beginning portions of the film are mostly nudity, and the extreme gore kicks in a little bit later. There's a sequence when Eva Derrick is standing in the nude, but it's difficult to see any full frontal in this scene. Another sequence has Victoria De Mare being fully nude on a table around the beginning, but you can't see any full frontal nudity in this part either. There's plenty of other nude scenes in the film, but none of these contain full nudity; this may disappoint some people.  It's a campy and extreme exploitation film; elements of comedy are present. Despite the extreme gore and high body count, the tone of movie isn't dark or depressing; I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a dark toned horror flick. This flick is extremely easy to follow; it's one of those films that you can just turn off you're brain and watch because you don't have to pay attention to it.  If you just want to be entertained I would highly recommend it. However, there are some things about the film that may be a problem with some people. The movie lacks atmosphere, suspense, and most of the scenery is bland; a lot of this film takes place indoors, so the lack of effective atmosphere and dull scenery may be a problem with some people. This is a low-budget flick, so the women's prison isn't that well designed and looks cheap and bland. As for the directing, I personally thought it was OK. I really had fun with the movie, but it isn't a film that's meant to be analyzed. It's too bad that this flick isn't more well known.  As of this particular time, there's only one seller I'm aware of that is offering it.  It should be available everywhere to buy.

I can't find a review that specifically states what they shot this movie with. My guess would be a good mini DV camcorder. As for the DVD, it's in widescreen but it isn't anamorphic; but the picture quality is clear, and it looks nice.  The commentary is pretty good, and it has other extras like outtakes and a photo gallery.",1323302400,14,2996,4.502762430939226

A woman is sent to a women's prison after surviving a werewolf attack that has killed her boyfriend and mauling her.  As her wounds miraculously heal, what awaits her during the next full moon?

8268304,4,B00181RD4G,"It's obvious from the 'get-go' that this is a 'film' made by gore movie fans and that they are having a lot of fun in producing this bit of genre fusion  weirdness. In a truly brilliant amalgam of the venerable Werewolf AND Women In Prison milieus ""A Werewolf In A Women's Prison"" offers lotsa what sexploitation and gore hounds are generally looking for - resulting in a pretty satisfying viewing experience.

This IS a low budget product - shot direct to video - with rudimentary cardboard looking interior sets - and a pretty horrible wolf critter - BUT it manages to rise above its' humble production values because the action is outrageous and it doesn't hold back in providing ample doses of naked female flesh and transgressive bloody imagery. It also doesn't hurt that the producers have a keen horror insider's knowledge of historic precedent and a wicked sense of humor.  The story is loaded with visual homages to other well known and respected werewolf and WIP films to be appreciated by their equally knowledgeable audience!  After the lead female and her boyfriend are attacked by a werewolf during a camping trip (similar to Wes Craven's ""CURSED"") he dies and she is bitten and 'infected'.  The 'dead' BF then keeps popping back into the story ala ""An American Werewolf In London"" while the 'heroine' has to contend with all the usual indignities of female prison life. Another blatant (if perhaps less well known) reference is made to the scene in the outstanding WIP flik ""Caged Women"" - wherein 2 girls are put out in the sun as punishment and they sustain one another by licking the sweat off of each others naked bodies.  As the film moves forward there are also many scenes reminiscent of Joe Dante's original ""The HOWLING"".

The tone and visual style of the film is broadly cartoon-ish - with garish colors and over-the-top performances by all concerned - but it somehow all 'works' and the end result is an amusing watch.  As previously noted - lotsa good gratuitous nudity ( tho no full frontal) - A fair amount of kink and bondage - and outrageous gore effects to be appreciated. The 'digital' image quality is very sharp.  A few nice 'extras' too.  This film gets it right by not taking itself seriously while catering to the savvy horror fan(s).
