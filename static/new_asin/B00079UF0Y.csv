8046342,1,B00079UF0Y,"first thing, there are 3 different distributors for this movie.  not too sure why, or if the movie is different, or this is being passed around like a cold.  the Gator Home Entertainment moniker is the dvd being reviewed here.  this is a story about a killer clown and a mother of a murdered son trying to find it.  the editing is a mess, as most of it deals with flashbacks; flashbacks in black & white, flashbacks in color, flashbacks in tainted hues.  the movie jumps around so much it is hard to determine the story line.  opening credits are like Halloween, a slow close up of a toy clown while credits roll.  the acting is indeed wooden to bad.  at one point, the main actress calls the clown ""nightbreed"" and not ""nightbreeder"" as in the title.  in trying to be weird, the director fails.  as an independent film, with limited budget, this needed a stronger story line, with emphasis on the acting and not trying to cover it's shortcomings with odd camera angles and excess editing.  skip this movie or rent it.  with used prices at a penny, i guess a few people want to get rid of this disc.",1265846400,,1099,4.412935323383085
8046343,1,B00079UF0Y,"HELLBREEDER is so poorly acted, directed, edited and filmed that I couldn't even finish watching it.  There are so many padded scenes adding nothing to whatever story there is, and it's about as exciting as paint by numbers.  Definitely a loser.",1109894400,2,245,4.951219512195122
