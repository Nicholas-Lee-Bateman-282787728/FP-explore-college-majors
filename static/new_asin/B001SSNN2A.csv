I don't buy many movies anymore especially ones that I haven't even seen, but I had to take a chance when I saw the trailer. The english dubbed is ok; I think one or two things got lost in the translation from French to English (ie: the golden deer). Worth every cent!",1487721600,5,357,4.424242424242424
3787178,4,B001SSNN2A,"Not the musical Disney, style rendition, but still OK. Dubbed in English, so lips don't match sound. I'm guessing original track is in French???",1487635200,3,144,5.041666666666667
3787179,5,B001SSNN2A,"This French version of Beauty and the Beast, also known as La Belle Et La Bete, is visually stunning and very easy to follow with English subtitles.  I do not own this specific version of the movie, but my sister owns a previously released DVD version that only has the French dialogue with English subtitles.  The details say that the audio will be in English but if it is, it will be voiceover!

This version follows much closer to the original story of Beauty and the Beast.  My sister and I love that there is actually a reason for the Beast to get angry at Belle's father for taking a rose from his grounds.  There are definitely some differences from the original story, but what was added and/or changed totally works.

I will definitely be buying this bluray version of the movie and if it does come with English voiceover dialogue, I will give it a try, but I loved it all in it's own French dialogue glory!  I highly suggest watching it with the French dialogue and the subtitles!  If you love fairytales then I would give this one a try!",1485475200,13,1048,4.421875
3787180,3,B001SSNN2A,This movie looks awesome...will it have an English audio soundtrack too please?,1484870400,,79,5.666666666666667
3787181,4,B001SSNN2A,"Ever since the 1700s, ""La Belle et La Bete"" has been an enduring and beloved fairy tale, inspiring countless books, movies, television shows, a ballet and an opera.

So you'd think that nothing new could be squeezed from the tale as old as time. But while Disney constantly cannibalizes and regurgitates their version, French director Christophe Gans released a far more spellbinding film -- a loose reimagining of the version made by the brilliant Jean Cocteau. The story can be rather thin at times, but it does an excellent job adding to the ""Beauty and the Beast"" lore, while spinning up luscious, hauntingly ethereal visuals.

When her widowed father (Andr Dussollier) loses his ships in a storm, Belle is the only member of her family to embrace their new, humbler life in a country cottage, while her siblings lounge around dreaming of the life they've lost. When one of the lost ships makes it back to port, her sisters start demanding new luxuries and dresses, but Belle only wants a rose. And it soon turns out that her dad may have trouble getting that much -- he loses his ship, attracts the attention of the cruel gambler Perducas (Eduardo Noriega), and ends up lost in a snowstorm.

Well, you know what happens -- he ends up taking shelter in a vast, half-crumbled castle overgrown with roses, and full of strange doglike creatures. But this castle is owned by a strange Beast (Vincent Cassel) who isn't pleased when the merchant takes a rose, and gives him just one day to say goodbye to his family.

Feeling that all this is her fault, Belle goes to the castle in her father's place -- and is instead given beautiful gowns, the freedom of the estate, and dinnertime every night with the awkward Beast. As she explores her new home, she also has dreams of a princess who lives there long ago, and the terrible events that led to the Beast's current predicament. But when she briefly visits her home, Belle finds that she may have accidentally brought a terrible threat to the Beast and his home.

""Beauty and the Beast"" appears to be something of a reimagining of Jean Cocteau's classic adaptation of the fairy tale. Not a literal remake, of course. Instead, it takes the symbolism and imagery of Cocteau's story, and reweaves them as new parts of the overall tale -- the deer that the Beast once hunted, the statues, the fluttering curtains, the catlike appearance of the Beast, and many other clever little details. It's reminiscent of Cocteau, but still very creative.

The biggest problem is that the story is a bit on the thin side, and there is never quite a point when we see the Beast win Belle's affections. However, writer/director Gans adds some new storylines and aspects to the story, particularly a more detailed backstory to the Beast's transformation, which Belle sees every night as she dreams, a villain in Perducas, and some menacing stone giants that lurk in the rose overgrowth. All this comes together in the climax, adding some action and rama to the previously dreamlike, haunting film.

But what truly sets this movie apart is the visuals. Every scene is a luscious, magical experience, as if it had been ripped from the pages of a storybook and somehow brought to life. The crumbling castle draped in roses and lit by golden motes, moonlit pools, the firelit banquets, the velvet gowns glittering with jewels, the oasis of misty forests in the heart of a frozen wasteland, the floating flower petals, and a fallen marble statue that gives Belle important hints of what has happened. This movie is a feast for the eyes, and the sheer beauty of it is almost enough to compensate for the thin story.

The one distracting aspect of the visuals is the CGI. It's not abysmal, but it never quite convinces the viewer of what they're seeing, whether it's luminous-eyed dog-creatures or the Beast's oddly masklike face and cartoonish mouth. It all looks slightly artificial.

As for acting, Seydoux gives the rather thin role of Belle some fiery determination, with enough courage to verbally banter and even challenge her beastly suitor despite her fear. Cassel does quite well as a tormented creature who loathes his own cursed existence, and seems to take it out on those around him. Also... the dogs. Yes, they are CGI, but these glowy-eyed, bobble-headed hounds are just the cutest little creatures.

In a time when fairy tale movies are either unoriginal or ""dark and gritty,"" the enchantment of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a welcome treat -- and its sheer visual beauty should be seen, if nothing else.",1480982400,28,4539,4.792838874680307

This story is one I've read and watched in every form and this one, and Cocteau's '46 version, truely grasp the imagery and mystery of the tale. This versions leans a bit heavy on cgi creatures, but so many scenes are stunning. I doubt anyone will ever top Cocteau's version, but this is a close second, and happily free of socio-political commentary like current versions.

3787191,4,B001SSNN2A,"This French live action feature film beat Disneys profitable live actioner to the box office by a couple of years and while its not close to perfect, often choosing to highlight style and visual over substance, it is nonetheless better at points than Disneys stodgy and sometimes lifeless adaptation of their own fantastic animated classic.  Where this film excels is in offering a very fairy wonderland full of magic and menace; the Beast, played with cat-like ferallity by Vincent Cassel, is more animalistic in his reactions to Beauty and less emotionally stormy than other modern romantic versions; the Beast menaces because cats are menacing unpredictable and agile agents whose minds are easily fixed and transfixed by their vision and appetite.  Nicely recalling a moment from the original French B&W Beauty and the Beast this Beast severs into a dinner with claws and teeth and savagery like a cat consuming a bird.  Its one of the most horrid moments that Beauty, played by ingnue Lea Seydoux, comes upon.  Beauty in this version is not a young woman but a girl on the cusp of womanhood and this film, unlike the Disney version, doesnt duck the issue of her nascent sexuality but neither does the film overdraw or fixate on it.  Beauty is an oddity to the Beast, sometimes precocious beyond her age and at other times a too eager youth exudes.  One criticism is that she is too confident around all of the Beasts creep (and that creepiness includes not just his unnerving appearance but the interior and exterior settings of the castle).  The movie takes its time in ferreting out how the Beast came into his loathsome visagery and is quite different from past accounts.  In one way of looking at it the Beast is such a man because he acts man-nish, stupidly, impetuously, mistakenly, but not necessarily caddishly or with evil heart.  Another departure in this film is how it focuses its ending.  When a group of brigands which includes Beautys brother finds their way into the Beasts enchanted woodland in expectation of stealing his riches they are shown to be the real villains but it is also shocking, especially when one is so used to the Disney versions, with how brutally the Beast dispatches them.  His fairy wonderland is actually scary and this PG-13 version isn't a safe place for the younger kiddies to stay.  It also makes the Beast seem more beastly, and less redeemable.  But don't worry as the story traditionally goes the Beast is tamed by Beauty.

And we see that they lived happily ever after",1519430400,,2521,4.8190255220417635

3787198,3,B001SSNN2A,"I knew exactly what I was getting into when I watched this movie, I actually did it for a compare/contrast project. And MAN was there no comparison.
The big issues are threefold. One, too much time is spent with the brother and his Les Mis rejected loan shark. If one is going to have an antagonist in Beauty and the Beast, that person should antagonize Beauty and the Beast, not one of Beauty's brothers. The involvement of Perducas and his gang in the third act feels like it was meant to add arbitrary stakes to an otherwise uncompelling climax.
Two, the flashbacks of the Beast/Prince with his first wife aren't helpful. The Prince seems smarmy and entitled, yet he has far more chemistry with his former Princess than he does with Belle. I would have preferred to just watch them.
Third, both of these things take time from Belle and the Beast actually having a relationship, to the point where I wondered if the reason she claims to love him was because the magic golden fireflies were planting the Princess' memories into Belle's brain as a loophole. The rest of the movie sees them as absurdly formal, or else at odds with one another, and some of the subtext (and even text) borders on abusive in particular, the scene on the ice.
Skip this version, it's not worth the scenery and costume porn.",1514592000,,1303,4.5965665236051505

3787214,5,B001SSNN2A,"I had seen the newest Disney live action Beauty and the Beast and found myself disappointed in one or two aspects of the movie.  I had heard that there was another live action version of this tale and that it was in French.  I had done a little research on it and bought the movie.  It comes with a downloadable digital version (with English subtitles for non-French speakers).
I had also seen one of the older versions of the French Beauty and the Beast (back in middle school during our ""French week"" in a language class).  There were some things from that older version (I want to say it was filmed around 1940s?  It was definitely a black and white film, so...) that were brought into this one and it was done so well.
The costumes and set designs are just absolutely stunning!  I was in love throughout the whole movie.  I loved the tale it told, as well.  Growing up with Disney fairy tales, I had started to delve deeper into the original tales but had, somehow, missed the original Beauty and the Beast tale.  It was wonderful to get a different perspective on the story and to watch everything on the edge of my seat.  No singing, but it's not needed at all.

3787217,4,B001SSNN2A,"Likely my error, but this version is dubbed in English. I did not see that clearly marked before I rented it. With no option to go to the original and stunning French (English subtitles), we stopped watching after two minutes and I found what I wanted va Netflix.

That said, this is a stunning film with a beautiful touch; every scene is rich with detail, subtext, and fresh perspective. More reminiscent of the Black and white classic, this film is art! and narrative intrinsically interwoven. The DVD format (which does come in different language options) is on my wish list.
This foreign film is viewer-friendly and clean; it could be USA PG rated. One scene, essential to the plot, does show part of a woman's bare body, but it is innocently treated and doesn't draw attention to anything inappropriate. The focus of this film is discovery and true beauty. Nuances along the way make this a refreshing must-see.",1505433600,,916,4.7974683544303796

Loved how closely they stuck to the old fairytale (nothing like the Disney versions, so if that's what you're expecting, don't). Acting was amazing. Set and costumes were amazing. Storyline was great with one critique, which you may not want to read if you're like me and don't want ANY spoilers when watching a movie for the first time...

SPOILERS:
My one beef is that there is so little time devoted to developing the love between Belle and the Beast. It was almost confusing. Like she is terrified of him, he goes after her, goes to kiss her and she's gonna let him, and then he saves her. The next morning she's all flirty and then when she makes her way back to the castle she's in love with him. What?? When and how did that happen? Because she had spent so little time with him, and the time she had spent, he was not charming. Her dreams didn't depict him as charming either. He was kind of a jerk husband before. So there wasn't much that made sense about her falling in love with him. That said, I still enjoyed the movie and I'd watch it again.",1504483200,,1190,4.336322869955157

3787225,1,B001SSNN2A,"What is it about this story that makes filmmakers disregard most important elements and add nonsense?  The version most often read is the 1756 account by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, an utterly charming story with many moral lessons.  It concerns a middle class merchant with two arrogant, social-climbing daughters who care only about clothes and status, and their interaction with their beautiful sister Belle, who is hardworking, takes care of their father, reads lots of books, and plays the harpsichord to entertain the father.  She has virtually no social life.  Then the family loses everything, and Belle has to work even harder while the sisters are assigned to herd the sheep.  The marriage prospects of the older sisters evaporate when they are mere shepherdesses dressed in rags, and they end up married to losers.  Meanwhile, Belle ends up married to an extremely handsome and wealthy prince and living in one of the most spectacular chateaus in France.

Why is this story not good enough to tell as it is?  Unlike the Disney version, this version at least keeps the older sisters, but turns them into minor airheads.  Then the similarities end.  The producers must have hired a group of teenaged video game fanatics to write the last half of the film.  It is filled with dreams that are almost indistinguishable from the plot line, but dominated by video game violence and unbelievable nonsense.  At least there are no singing candlesticks and teapots and no Gaston, which is about the best that I can say about this appalling version.",1503360000,,1555,4.984496124031008

3787266,3,B001SSNN2A,"Too pretty to give it less than 3 stars but the story, character development and choice of casting for Beast were 1 star.  Why would she return to the beast??  At first he threatens to kill her family if she ever leaves. But, then when she made a deal with him for one day with her family in exchange for a dance he went back on it.  So then she screams at him when he gets too personal with his feelings about her and told him that he would always disgust her.  He takes off and she spies on him eating a freshly killed boar, she is repulsed and runs away in disgust and fear.  Then, as she is fleeing the beast comes upon her, causing her to fall into the icy water right before he almost kisses her, I assume his breath still reeked of raw pig flesh?  She wakes up, right after this and is suddenly playful with him and he agrees to let her see her family.  When he warns her about staying away she says, ""Yeah yeah, you'll kill my family""  To which he replies, ""no, I will die"".  I even made the joke out loud ""well then now she is definitely not coming back you, ya monster (I mean even as a human he was a dick obsessed with killing a beautiful golden doe... a magical GOLDEN DOE! Plus, what is he, like 30 years older than her?  He is not even slightly hot!  What redeeming qualities did he have that would make Belle or for that matter the gorgeous forest nymph fall so desperately in love with him???  was it because this 50 year old actor is also listed as a CO PRODUCER???  Ugh, so wrong.  Anyways, we are to believe that between her falling into the frozen lake and waking up she somehow fell in love with the Beast which is why she chose to come back, for fear that he would die.  Sorry, but the writers relied on previous tellings of this story for the viewers to fill in the inevitable ""falling in love with each other"" bit.  They never showed us any development in their relationship.  Maybe it was edited out?  and what about the adorable puppy things that were her best friends?  What?  he literally never interacted with them!  Also the 2 brothers besides the jerk one were pointless.  Maybe they tried out for the role of the beast before they realized that it was already written for the old guy who got it and the lead actress freaking BEGGED the writers to give them roles so she could at least have some good looking guys to hang out with during filming?  Thats my guess.  Oh, and there is now way she could have dressed herself  and no way in HELL she could have done her own hair everyday.

If you're thinking of Disney before watching, don't. It's not like that. I find that appealing as I enjoy stories closer to the original and not a Disney knock-off.

This is a beautiful telling, closer to the original story. It's sub-titled, but not at all a cheap looking film. The acting is good. I was really impressed with the imagery and costumes.

It fell a bit short on that & also, if the director should of added more enchanted, cute animals.

At least, I didn't think they were lacking until I watched this one.
If you watch this on Amazon, you'll get English overlay voices instead of French, which doesn't often portray the same emotion as the you can tell the actors are.

3787283,2,B001SSNN2A,"The beautiful music during the movie clip I saw on youtube, that led me like the Pied Piper to watch the movie, didn't even show up. I kept waiting for it. Without that and the building of the friendship between the two, the dance scene disgusted me. I now understand and can relate to the negative reviews this movie received. It's choppy. It felt like someone had some good ideas and was in a hurry to make this a movie, but hadn't finished the story yet, and thought, ""It'll come to us as we go."" It really didn't seem like it had a final draft. It is sad because they really did have some great ideas for one of my favorite stories. I like the living stone idea and the twists in the story. I loved the scenery, the staircase of the castle, the roses and the garden maze. The instant love Belle feels probably came from the dream story because she didn't spend hardly any time with beastly man. Her ease in being in her undergarments and talking informally with him as if they were long time friends, didn't make sense because they didn't have hardly any scenes with each other having conversations and getting to know one another. I didn't like his dialogue about ""having her"" or him hovering over her in the bed. That would have been bestiality. I thought he was vulgar and the nudity was inappropriate. This is definitely not appropriate for young and some adult audiences. This could have been a good movie if they had spent some extra time with the odd couple, spending more time together. I also hated the dubbed version. I prefer the original voices coming out of the right mouths at the right time. That was a sloppy job. I liked his attire and the dresses, but they were too low necked. I like Vincent Cassel. I would have liked to have heard his voice more. Even when he or any French person, speaks English, it's a beautiful sound. I loved the plant behavior. It's really a shame they didn't do this movie right.
