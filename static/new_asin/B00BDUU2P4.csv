8566775,4,B00BDUU2P4,What I enjoyed most about this dvd was that it allowed the viewer a glimpse into the unity that prevails off stage as well as on stage between Deva & Miten and their team that supports them. Miten's narrative behind the creation of his song 'Ashes to Ashes' comes straight from the heart and is my favorite performance on this dvd. Deva's timely sense of humor always serves to surprise me and the serenity of her voice singing the mantras always brings me to that place of calm that often eludes me as I try to find it on my own.,1379980800,,530,4.257425742574258
