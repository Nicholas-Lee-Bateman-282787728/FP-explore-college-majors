3854455,4,B0026MOVN2,Frontline always does a great job. Where was the SEC?  But he was not the only one.,1264464000,,83,3.8823529411764706
3854456,5,B0026MOVN2,"Perhaps the most fact-based documentary available on this quintessential Ponzi scheme. Madoff is a master con artist to be sure, but he is only the tip of a glacial mass on Wall Street. From reviewer comments here and elsewhere, it seems most folks just don't recognize the larger economic, social and ethical context in which this scam took place. Since Reagan, the waves of federal deregulation and the ill-conceived withdrawal of oversight literally created an incubation chamber for greed and abuse. The casino capitalism of Bush/Cheney opened the gates to outright fraud and rampant corruption.

If we look back just a few years, Enron, Tyco and WorldCom were simply the prelude to Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros, Fannie, Freddie, AIG -- and Madoff. Sadly, America is becoming a nation that knows the price of everything... and the value of nothing. From corporate debt that is reported as assets, to fantasy home mortgages that are expected to default, to the ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless"" mentality that is so widely promoted by the media and embraced by the public, it is abundantly obvious that this nation has lost it's moral compass. To quote Justice Louis Brandeis, ""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.""",1252195200,15,1310,4.954545454545454
3854457,2,B0026MOVN2,"Madoff committed the largest investment scheme in American history.  Folk lost $65 billion dollars because of him.  This work gives some of the facts behind the tragedy.
Newspapers have continually said they suspect Madoff could not have accomplished this on his own.  Althought some close to Madoff refused to be interviewed here, others spoke.  This program lists names from which I imagine that prosecutors could find more info.
This felt like Titanic in which multiple small errors added to something large and devastating.  Dahmer could have been stopped earlier in his murder spree, but police let him go.  Similar here, the SEC looked toward Madoff once but never dug further.  The 1986 Challenger tragedy happened in part because NASA wanted to launch the spaceship no matter what.  This work says SEC didn't have enough staff to go after Madoff.  That may be a credible excuse, but they sho' should have egg on their face.
This work speaks infrequently of Madoff's biography.  Some audience members may want a psychological profile of the man and they will be disappointed not to receive it here.  You never get a sense of what made this guy tick.
This work touches upon something: Madoff shows no remorse.  I don't want to be insensitive, but buyer beware!  If someone says to you, ""I can make you lots of money, but never tell anyone I'm the person doing it"" then that should tell you something is fishy!
The work doesn't touch upon something: I wonder if the far-right push to deregulate the business sector played a role in this.  In the same way that it destroyed the housing market, perhaps the laziness that conservative politicians and voters adore caused this mess.  Take that, I-worship-the-free-market goons!  SNAP!",1245542400,5,1735,4.951557093425605
8353152,5,B0026MOVN2,"The fact that Madoff became so powerful so quickly and wound up controlling a vast empire, all of it based on horrible lies, just goes to show how sick and twisted the U.S. economy has been. The man's arrogance and greed shines through completely. The only real issue with the movie is that it ideally would've had more context, especially when it comes to the victims going after Madoff's associates, but that's a minor quibble with what is a fascinating documentary.",1524441600,,468,4.790123456790123

8353154,5,B0026MOVN2,Terrific documentary on the events that created the biggest fraud in history.  Well told and easy to grasp the financial terms and vehicles that created the monster as it picked up steam and became a runaway train.  Highly recommend this DVD if you are looking for a concise and informative documentary of events.,1477526400,,313,4.886792452830188

8353156,5,B0026MOVN2,I thought twice about paying for such a short program.  The presentation is fascinating.  I have seen several programs on Madoff and this is by far the best.  Well worth the time and money.,1407283200,,189,4.5
8353157,5,B0026MOVN2,Fascinating viewing to watch a thief who took off and has cleaned out all his friends but in the process but I would be sure his family have plenty of money to fall back on and he would have great memories of all is excursions thanks to his friends.,1406246400,,249,4.1020408163265305
8353158,4,B0026MOVN2,This documentary was very good I purchased it to show it in my college ethics class and students enjoyed it.,1400889600,,108,4.45
8353159,3,B0026MOVN2,"The narration goes up to December 2008 in which month Madoff confessed to authorities.
However, the court cases against him and his family members/associates are not covered.
An important part of the Madoff affair is the struggle to get defrauded victims some measure of
restitution and it is also would have been welcome to explore what impact, if any, the Madoff
affair had on the Financial Crisis (as opposed to clear impact  the Financial Crisis had on the Madoff
ponzi scheme).  The question What regulatory measures have been instituted in the aftermath of Madoff's conviction
and will they be sufficient to avert future ponzi schemes?"" is not addressed.
Frankly, you can just read the wikipedia entry on the Madoff affair and garner
more valuable information than that available overall on the DVD.
My criticism may seem unfair given that the airing date for the PBS episode was in 2009 but,
as a learning resource, the dvd falls short in that it tells only half the story.  With Amazon slashing
ten dollars off the price, however, I would still recommend purchase provided that content
expectations are put into proper perspective.",1393545600,3,1139,5.015873015873016
8353160,5,B0026MOVN2,"I'm not a fan of PBS or NPR and would not consider them reliable sources of information, but I have to say that this documentary was excellent. I could discern no bias here as the editors did not sugarcoat the government's (the SEC in particular) role in the Bernie Madoff fiasco. They were given every clue and every lead regarding his corruption yet still found the charges against him to be unfounded. This documentary did a magnificent job of highlighting the fashion by which ordinary people become contaminated by greed along with the need to maintain a beneficial status quo. A simply superb hour of TV.",1279756800,,610,4.764150943396227

""It was to good to be true...But nobody wanted to ask questions...From small-time investors to sophisticated hedge fund managers...And where were the regulators?...""

The above is what the narrator tells us at the beginning of this revealing documentary.  It unravels the true story and mechanics behind the world's first global Ponzi scheme--a scheme ""that lasted longer, reached wider, and cut deeper than any other business scandal in history!""

(A Ponzi scheme is a pyramid type swindle in which very high returns are promised to early investors, who are paid off with money put up by later investors.  Generally a hedge fund hedges (reduces) some of the risks inherent in investments using a variety of methods.)

This documentary was televised on May 12, 2009 and explains everything up until one month before the mastermind behind this scheme was sentenced.

Who was the mastermind?  ANSWER:  Bernard ""Bernie"" Madoff.  Madoff (pronounced ""Made Off"") was a former stockbroker, financial advisor, and chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange.

The fact is that billions of dollars were channelled to Madoff's investment firm.  He and his ""feeders"" became wealthy--fabulously wealthy.  All this ended when Madoff's con was discovered on Dec. 11, 2008.  Madoff himself confessed that it was all ""one big lie.""

This documentary answers many key questions such as:

(1) How did Madoff pull it off?
(2) Who helped him?
(3) When did it all begin?
(4) With all the suspicions and many red flags, just where were the regulators?
(5) How was Madoff able to pull his con off for so long?
(6) Why did he finally get caught?

There are brief comments about what happened made by journalists, business people, lawyers, bilked investors, etc.  As well, there is lots of archival footage shown.

Be aware that this documentary does not stop to define terms.  There are a few terms (like the two defined above) that the average viewer may not be familiar with.  When you come across such terms, it's best to pause the documentary, and look them up.  Doing this will aid in understanding and enjoyment of this program.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  Not mentioned is that this DVD has closed captioning.  It has no extras.

In conclusion, this is an extremely interesting and well-done documentary that seems to me illuminates two lessons:

(1) It's YOUR money.  YOU have to look after it (not someone else).

(2) Don't give your money to people named Madoff.  They just might MAKE OFF with it.

(2009;  55 min;  first televised on the PBS program ""Frontline;""  wide screen;  8 chapters)
