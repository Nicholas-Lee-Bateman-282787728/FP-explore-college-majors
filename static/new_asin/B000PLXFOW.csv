8192332,4,B000PLXFOW,"Bought this for my now deceased mother who was battling cancer.  She loved Lee Williams and the Spiritual QCs and found their traditional foot stomping, rhythmic old school gospel music soothing and reminiscent of her childhood. He loved the lack of theatrics in his on stage presence and the fact that he rarely ventured more than a few feet away from the mics.  It became one of her delights as she declined. I'm a huge fan because of the joy it brought to her.",1404000000,,463,4.5

8192335,1,B000PLXFOW,"I must say that I was very disappointed with this particular DVD- 'So Much to Be Thankful For'.  This was given as a Christmas gift to a family member.  In particular, the lighting was somewhat dark, unlike that of the 'Right on Time' DVD.  The explanation from MCG Records was that the producer of this particular DVD used a different production technique, presumably to create a theatrical impression with the darker lighting.  Also, Lee Williams did not sing a majority of the songs on this production.  Lee Williams is the 'draw' for this act, and this aspect of the production was a huge disappointment.  As such, if you are looking for vintage Lee Williams on this production, you may be in for a disappointment, unless of course your point of interest is the Spiritual Q C's.",1199836800,,782,4.713235294117647
