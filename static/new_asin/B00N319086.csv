6608225,2,B00N319086,"I'm a huge Drivin N Cryin fan and had such high expectations for this documentary, but unfortunately it ended up being a frustrating, less than professional piece that just seemed to fall flat on its face. On the positive side, the film allows the members of DNC to tell the story of the band's evolution and momentary rise to fame, but it lacks depth. It plays out like a flat story that doesn't reach any emotional or true understanding of what the band was about any more than reading reviews through the years could tell a fan.

Cinematically, the film was miserable. Sound seems to have been recorded directly onto the internal mics of a DSLR, making for static and room noise-filled audio tracks that sound distant and at many times indiscernible. Focus was on the interview subjects from time to time, but more often on the background objects rather than the interviewees themselves. There was an indiscriminate use of black and white footage and even visible timecode that didn't seem to have any other purpose than to try and seem ""arty"" or to remind us that we're watching a video. And effects from what I suspect was Final Cut Pro X were used from time to time for no other reason that, I suppose, because they were there.

All in all, I think the team that made the film would have been better off hiring a professional crew to shoot the piece and put together a storyline that would add some emotional impact and do this great band some justice.",1420070400,5,1458,4.582375478927203
6608226,4,B00N319086,"This is a good independent documentary about a band that was caught between genres as defined by the industry.  Drivin' N' Cryin is a talented, pure rock n' roll band that means a lot to a lot of people and touched one man enough for him to invest his own money and years of his life to make this film and tell a story that has probably happened with thousands of other artists over the years.  It's quite obvious that the film maker is an amateur, but the finished product is polished enough to be worth your investment in time for a couple of hours of entertainment.  It would also make a great gift for any DNC fan, any fan of southern rock, or any artist that has had a shot at the brass ring, or even maybe held onto it for a minute.",1415059200,3,738,4.111111111111111

I like the rock side of DnC but the folksy part is ok too.  I think what may have hurt them is when you went to a show, you didn't know whether they were going to do a rock show or a folk show.",1481587200,,325,3.6142857142857143

6608279,5,B00N319086,"I ran across this band late one night in 89 on MTV.  The song was Honeysuckle Blue, and I was hooked.  I had to here to more, so I went out and bought the disk, and then another, and another. I was intrigued by their ability to switch from fiery rockers to folksy/country laden songs at the drop of a hat.  It was different, but it all worked, mainly because Mr. Kinney's vocals and  lyrics are so effective and real.  This band has been in my music rotation ever since.  When I found out they had documentary out on the band, I knew I had to see it.  Is it perfect?  No, but anyone who knows and loves the band will want to take a look, it is well worth your time.",1477785600,3,665,3.984848484848485
6608280,5,B00N319086,I initially rented this movie because I thought it was a Scarface sequel because of the thumbnail but I continued watching because it was a great movie.  I highly recommend if you like documentaries.  The movie is surprisingly not just region-centric (Atlanta/Southeast based) and you don't need to know anything about the band before hand to enjoy.  I'm very glad this was finally available via Amazon Prime as I was too cheap to purchase previously.,1477440000,,451,4.986666666666666

6608282,4,B00N319086,"With the popularity of MTV coupled with VH1 music fans have had access to the life and times of rock bands from the 70s forward in more detail than we would probably like. At the same time were a society that loves to look at an accident as we drive by rather than look away, one that scrambles for the latest scandal found on the checkout lane tabloids and loves to see the rich and famous fall down to our level. Sadly the reality is that many we would think fall into that wealthy category never quite got there no matter how much fame they garnered. Take Drivin n Cryin.

The southern rock band that formed in 1985 was hugely popular on the local circuit but took a while to break out nationally. Now when I say southern rock band don't misunderstand, this isn't an Allman Brothers of Molly Hatchet style band. Drivin n Cryin was straight up rock and roll. But as with most bands a taste of fame led them down some wrong paths and the end result was losing the possible stardom they could have achieved.

Combing music videos with interviews and home footage, director Eric von Haessler puts together a story of a band that began as friends and ended up broken apart by success. The movie presents the story of how they came together, how the central figure of the band was and remains Kevin Kinney and how egos, drugs and the record business can tear apart a band that people love and turn them into something else completely. As I said, its a familiar tale but at the same time no two stories of how this combustible mixture results in the story of a band is the same.

My exposure to the band is probably the same as most, their hit single Fly Me Courageous. What is really upsetting and anger inducing is to listen to the songs played in this film that make up the rest of their catalog and wondering why no one ever played them on the radio. It makes you regret not having their albums on your shelf or their downloads on your iPod. Watching and listening to this movie might help to change that.

But its not just the music that makes this movie work. Its the people involved in their story, the various band members who have come and gone, their battles in and outside of the studios and more. The creativity that oozes from each and their contributions when combined is a part of the bands history. The way they got caught up in the whole LA experience of stardom and the effect it had on them both as a band and as individuals. Best of all its all told in their own words, in the interviews they all do.

By the end of the movie youll find yourself cheering for a comeback for this band. An odd choice of words, comeback, because actually they never left. Kinney still plays with a version of the band, perhaps not in arena settings but to appreciative crowds none the less. He still has the outlet to display is creativity and skill.

This movie isn't just for fans of the group. Its for music fans, rock fans and those who enjoy finding out just what goes on behind the scenes. Go in looking for those things and youll come away with hope for a band that some say could have been but who in reality still are. Lets hope that they get not just the recognition but the respect they deserve.",1477008000,,3203,4.321131447587354
6608283,5,B00N319086,"I recently re-discovered a box of CDs in my attic, which contains some of my old favorites and some that make me scratch my head in bewilderment. In that box was Drivin N Cryin's ultimate collection. I love that CD and have enjoyed getting reacquainted with it.

A friend mentioned the Scarred but Smarter documentary on Amazon Prime, so I gave it a shot. There are bits and pieces of this movie that reveal it was done by a first-time filmmaker, but overall I was very satisfied with the premise, the interviews, and the story. Unlike most rock documentaries, the premise here is about why a band with such great music wasn't much bigger and more successful. I believe the movie accomplishes its goal in defining what success is for this band, and delivers some freaking fantastic music along the way.",1477008000,,802,4.6879432624113475

6608286,4,B00N319086,Very well done rock-doc!  I love Drivin n Cryin - they are a very under-rated band and it was interesting to hear their history.  If you're an Atlanta native or just enjoy some good rock I would highly recommend this film.,1476748800,,222,4.390243902439025
6608287,5,B00N319086,Looong time listener of Eric Von and I have to say this is a terrific rock doc. I have been into DNC since about 1987 and it was a pleasure to see how in depth this film goes. Very well done and a definite recommendation to any rock N roll fan especially of Southern Rock. Its a POWER F***ING HOUSE!!!!,1476662400,,302,4.05
6608288,5,B00N319086,"From college in the early 90's to this afternoon, Drivin' N' Cryin' have been the background noise of so many chapters and this documentary did not disappoint. Like Widespread Panic, the Indigo Girls and R.E.M. they are one of the local bands we are proud of that made it. Life N Times shares their backstory and asks the question why aren't they bigger? To many of us they are. It's great- Thanks a bunch.",1476489600,,406,4.5

6608292,3,B00N319086,"Three stars because the production was clumsy and the pacing dragged a bit; but I have to give some respect to Mr. Von Haessler's persistence and determination to get a legendary band's story told. Nobody has ever been able to combine folk and punk rock with the power and sincerity Drivin' n Cryin' had, especially in their early years. Kevn Kinney remains a tremendous talent, an inventive and prolific songwriter, a tireless champion for the poor and downtrodden, and a towering role model for anyone who ever thought they were too ugly to front a great rock band.",1476403200,,567,4.795918367346939

6608300,5,B00N319086,"Great doc, very well done by first time director Eric Von Haessler.  Does a great job of putting the spotlight on this band that is very well known for a very long time (since the mid-80s) in Atlanta and the Southeast but strangely enough not hardly at all anywhere else.  Almost had the big breakthrough in the early 90s and some great songs for doing so, but it just never happened.  See the story of why.  They are still heard on Atlanta radio daily and anyone who has lived here since the 90s can sing along with at least a couple of their songs by heart.",1475798400,4,559,4.245283018867925

Kudos to the band and EVH for telling their story.",1475712000,,339,3.788732394366197

6608310,5,B00N319086,This is a great rock and roll documentary!  I've been a fan of both the band and the filmmaker for many years and this movie perfectly captures this underrated band.

6608315,5,B00N319086,"Scarred and Smarter is a solid documentary about the rock band Drivin N Cryin, period.  But, not period.....there's more.  It moves faster than most music docs I've seen, but it hangs in there and delivers an honest story about a band that deserves greater recognition.  Kevin Kinney is an artist that has always been true to himself and the art that he wants to deliver.  Eric Von Haessler appreciates this medium of story telling, and if you take the time to listen to his wonderful podcast on ericvonline.com, you'll get to know the man behind the camera.  Eric is someone who has no interest in delivering a story that is full of fluff, but cuts through the non essentials and delivers a raw story that is informative, low-fi and very enjoyable to watch.  So, sit back, and watch, a documentary that takes you on a tour through the lives of those involved around a great band- Drivin N Cryin.",1475193600,,896,4.60377358490566

8675898,3,B00N319086,"Glad to get to see this finally, but I'm of two minds about it.  Skimmed through most of the reviews, and they are all from people who are already familiar with Drivin'n'Cryin'.  This is what I suspected while viewing the doc. Even the trailer and the intro don't really SELL anybody on why they'd want to watch this. While good, the film does not do anything to attract new fans to the towering greatness of DNC, and that's a shame.  As a northern carpetbagger living in Athens while all this was going on, I understand why people from other regions didn't go for this band.  When DNC was first breaking out, the musical nation was still recuperating from the likes of Black Oak ""You can rape Mother Nature, but you can't rape a girl"" Arkansas and other Southern hard rock bands of that unfortunate ilk. It didn't take me long in Athens to work out that DNC were a different proposition entirely, and that their music reflected the concerns of all of us. Great band, great music, Kevn Kinney is legitimately a songwriting genius and the film's comparisons to Neil Young are by no means overstretched,, but my advice would be to do a little research - track them down on the streaming platform of your choice - and *then* watch this.  It will mean a lot more to you once you discover how great this band really was and is.",1497657600,,1322,4.468879668049793
8675899,5,B00N319086,"Awesome movie, well documented. This comes from an old school ATL rock fan. Got their cassettes back in the 80's and still see them live when we can around the SE. Bubble Factory is kick ass, so is all of their recent EP releases. BUY them and support.  We Saw Kevn recently on a solo show and was so talented and gracious.  Long live DNC.",1494892800,,339,4.2
8675900,4,B00N319086,"Nicely structured and represents the band so well. Interviews and music combine to make a lasting impression of the realities of this era of indie bands negotiating record deals with majors and also the tenor of he times, trying to please the marketing folks and the audiences while being authentic and dealing with multiple life issues that inevitably arise in the marketplace of popular music and music industry capitalism.",1491782400,,425,5.173913043478261
8675901,5,B00N319086,"WOW!  I was a college student in Alabama living in Oakland/San Francisco in the summer of 1986 when I bought a 688 sampler with two DNC songs - ""Stand Up and Fight for It""  and ""Count the Flowers"".  I was smitten from that moment on.  I loved them because they appealed to my collective musical influence of Neil Young, CSNY, Aerosmith, Led Zepplin, etc.  They had soul, feeling and most of all, they had balls.  They cut through the 80's BS of corporate rock and plastic music.  This documentary captured everything that I thought was DNC and more.  I never understood why DNC never made it to the level of REM.  What I realize now is that you don't have to rise to that level to be successful (also see Pixies, Dinosaur Jr, Sonic Youth, Replacements).  This film is beautifully done and captures the heart and soul of a band that was so misunderstood.  It finally puts a story and reason of their musical direction and decisions.  I loved the band then and this film rekindled that love even more.  A must watch for anyone that loves a good story of  heartache and perseverance.",1490313600,,1080,4.5
8675902,4,B00N319086,"Scarred but Smarter documents a band devoted to their music and fans. DNC survived their personal and business problems with talent, a passion for performance and a sense of humor. Scarred But Smarter stays fresh, funny, and instructive upon multiple viewings.",1489104000,,260,5.365853658536586
