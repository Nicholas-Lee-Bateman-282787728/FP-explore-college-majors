Historical, the witnesses of a painful past of racism are awaiting in real time the election of our first black president, remembering their struggle for equality not so long ago. Mr. Amstrong, The Barber of Birmingham earns your admiration and sympathy by his genuine simplicity and strong commitment to human rights. The music, the characters, the pictures, everything is genuine and beautiful in this touching movie. A must see for all the future generations.",1349222400,,569,5.129032258064516
