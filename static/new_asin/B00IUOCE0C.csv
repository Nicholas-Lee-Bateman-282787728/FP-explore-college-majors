8645536,1,B00IUOCE0C,"This is a review for THIS blu ray product, not the film itself which I love.  I bought this blu ray because I am a huge fan of Hayao Miyazaki and couldn't wait for the US release.  This is a Chinese bootleg, DO NOT BUY.  Go to blu-ray.com or just google and you will notice that the real version of the import does not have any English on the front cover.  Also this product has no English dub, while the authentic release does.  PLEASE do not make the same mistake I did and pay $50 for a Ghibli pirate knockoff.  As demonstrated by this one, some of them are quite crafty.",1408492800,8,574,4.126126126126126

8645538,5,B00IUOCE0C,"Price was good, picture quality is excellent somewhat lacking in features, however it is a remarkable film that deserves it's place in any film collection.",1405900800,,155,5.24
