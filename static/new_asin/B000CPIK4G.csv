8100118,4,B000CPIK4G,"DEADLY STRANGERS opens w/ the escape of a dangerous -unseen- maniac from a mental hospital. Said psycho now roams the countryside, leaving a trail of victims behind. Meanwhile, a young woman named Belle Adams (Hayley Mills- ENDLESS NIGHT) is hitching her way to the train station. Along the way Belle encounters a brutish trucker w/ his own ideas about how she can ""pay"" for a lift! After getting away from him, she hitches another ride w/ a seemingly normal young man, named Steven. As they drive along, we learn more about his history, as well as Belle's tragic past through a series of flashbacks. DEADLY STRANGERS is sort of a road trip / mystery / thriller film, complete w/ murder, voyeurism, bikers, road rage, and the lovely Ms. Mills in just about every scene! Also, watch for Sterling Hayden (DR. STRANGELOVE, VENOM) in an important cameo! Great stuff!...",1401148800,3,865,4.851351351351352
8100119,5,B000CPIK4G,"Both movies have very good sound and picture quality though somewhat predictable..  Deadly strangers is the best in my opinion.  I got my copy for a dollar, so I don`t understand the scalper price .  It must be cheaper somewhere, if so i recommend buying it.",1361232000,3,258,4.565217391304348
