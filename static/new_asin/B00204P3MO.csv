If you just got the DVD alone it'd be worth the money but for the diehard fans he's thrown on over three hours of radio broadcasts as well as an interview with the Racers' radio play-by-play broadcaster Bob Lamey (who is beyond excellent and one of the most exciting voices in play-by-play...think Gus Johnson before Gus Johnson). He also puts on a pdf of his personal Racers' history--Red, White & Blues. This is a fantastic look at both the history of the team and the author's own love affair with it. The book will be of more interest to hockey fans whereas the radio broadcasts are a bit more for the hockey historian or a diehard Racers fan. Even so I enjoyed Lamey so much I envy Indianans who got to enjoy his play-by-play in hockey but also with the NFL Colts and NBA Pacers over the years.

The DVDs themselves feature a 50-minute Racers documentary with plenty of talking heads interview clips with players, coaches and announcers as well as some terrific game highlights. The other two parts on Disc 1 are nothing to write home about. Kind of bizarre choices showing bits of Racers All-Star players playing in the 1977 WHA All-Star Game and a shrt fight reel.

Disc 2 contains an almost complete game broadcast of the Racers' second to last game in their history vs. the Edmonton Oilers (featuring Wayne Gretzky's return to Indianapolis in, of course, an Oiler jersey). To be honest, although there are plenty of goals I found the play a bit slow and not a great game. But the other game which has only the third period of a Racers game in Cincinnati vs. their fierce rivals, the Stingers, is terrific. The crowd atmosphere is intense and the play is much faster-paced plus we get the Stingers' broadcast so can hear from the other side of this regional rivalry as well as ex-Racers coach Jacques Demers doing the color.

Quality all around is first rate and the production values are top notch. I was incredibly impressed with the game footage on most of the DVD holding up pretty well now over three decades later. Plus I guarantee you'll be humming the Racers' theme song after hearing it so often in breaks on both DVDs.

Lastly, to those not in the know, Wayne Gretzky started his pro hockey career with the WHA Indianapolis Racers before he was traded to the WHA Edmonton Oilers, and you get to see bits of him in action as well as interviews with the players/coaches at the time. Also, Mark Messier did a stint with the Racers which is also talked about on the DVD.",1382227200,,2707,4.5847107438016526
8431855,5,B00204P3MO,"In response to the review below: The DVD title is NOT misleading: the name of the team documentary within the DVD is titled ""Red, White & Blues: Indianapolis Racers hockey 1974-1979,"" and this is just one feature of the DVD as a whole. There is additional Gretzky content in the game footage, radio broadcasts, and also in the electronic book. The DVD is about Gretzky, Indianapolis and the WHA as a whole -- and that is what the title indicates.

I have never seen MORE accurate information or maetrials about Wayne Gretzky's start as a major league player. Check out the other 2 DVDs in this series for a lot more on the World Hockey Associaiton, one of them has even more newly uncovered Gretzky-Racers footage...",1317340800,,716,4.682539682539683
8431856,3,B00204P3MO,"The title is misleading (The title on the DVD is actually Red, White and Blues). There is only one chapter involving Wayne Gretzky. I was expecting much more given the title. If you like hockey this is a decent movie to watch. If you are more of a Gretzky fan, the movie may dissapoint. The 1978 Oilers/Racers is a nice bonus.",1299801600,,326,4.360655737704918
8431857,5,B00204P3MO,"This is a great dvd  not only for the Indianapolis Racers fans but also WHA and hockey history fans. This is a good complement to the Timothy Gassen book publishing in 2007. ( In the dvd bonus you have a updated electronic version of the book! )
 You will discover a hockey market with great hockey fans.  Rare footage included in the dvd. The bonus are simply fantastic! You will get 3 hours of rare radio game of the 70's. the quality of the sound is excellent. Also in the bonus 23 pages of articles from Racers publications. A lot of story about the team.
 If you liked the dvd set `` WHA chronicles`` buy that dvd too.
6 hours of great hockey! With the dvd i become a Indianapolis Racers fan!",1241481600,2,697,4.257575757575758
