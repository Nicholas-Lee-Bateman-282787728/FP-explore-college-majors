6247052,3,B00I0YHPLA,I've only done this video twice and the instructor  is already on my nerves. She often talks and counts to the beat of the music. She also doesn't do some of the workout but instructs using arm motions. The workout itself is fine. It definitely isolates the butt and thigh.,1419033600,2,273,4.46
6247053,5,B00I0YHPLA,"Don't be fooled by the 30 min. run time, it really kicks your butt. I much prefer Shelly to Tanya as an instructor. She is fast-paced, gives great cues and doesn't make corny comments like Tanya tends to. I like to pair this with the 30 min ab and arms workout for a full hour workout, as a break from the 1 hr P-57.",1415923200,,316,3.953125

6247055,3,B00I0YHPLA,"I enjoy including some barre workouts as part of my strength training.  I particularly like Sadie Lincoln's Barre3 method (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Barre-Conditioning/dp/B00FEHCR1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Barre Conditioning</a>&nbsp;and The Barre Method Workouts (currently using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bar-Method-Super-Sculpting-Workout-1/dp/B00KHZZ2GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bar Method Super Sculpting Workout 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bar-Method-Super-Sculpting-II-Workout/dp/B005JGVB8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bar Method Super Sculpting II Workout</a>).

This DVD was the first I've tried from the Physique 57 series.  I had been intrigued about it for some time, as I had heard that the workout particularly focused on the glutes and hamstrings; this was appealing to me, as many barre routines tend to overwork the fronts of the thighs.  The Main Menu for this DVD offers options for Introduction - Main Program - About Physique 57 (3m) - Client Testimonials (2m; also plays while the DVD is loading).  In the 4.5-minute intro, P57 founder Tanya Becker talks about how her method is based on ""interval overload"" and includes isometric work.  She recommends going P57 workouts for 3-4 hours per week, either the longer 57-minute workouts or the shorter 30-minute routines like this one.  At the end of the intro, Shelly Knight, the instructor for this workout, demos a few of the moves included in the routine.

For the main workout, Knight is featured in a studio with approximately 6 background exercisers.  The two closest to her, Sherry and Lauren, area also P57 instructors; Sherry shows easier modifications, whereas Lauren shows more advanced versions.  Without further warning, the music starts right up (loud, fast-paced, and vocal), and Knight jumps right into the workout.  Sometimes she is performing the exercises, sometimes she is instructing only.  I have further broken down the routine below.

WARM-UP (2 minutes)
This consists of standard high knee marches generally seen in barre work, with some twists added in.  There is a super-quick (and rather awkward, IMO) transition down to the floor for a brief set of push-ups and then plank work performed on one side of the body only.

LUNGE WORK (8 minutes)
Knight leads you through an awkward transition to a lunge position (it would have been much easier for her to just to say ""come to a lunge"").  From there you'll perform pulsing lunges, pulsing curtsy lunges, rear leg lifts, and front leg extensions, all on the same side.  Then you transition back to the floor to repeat the push-up series on the second side, and following this, you repeat the lunge series on the second side as well.

PLIES/THIGH DANCING (4.5 minutes)
Next is an approximately 2.5-minute segment consisting of standing wide-legged plies, adding in variations such as lifting the heels.  Knight then lead the group to their knees for a thigh dancing segment that is short (about 2 minutes) but intense.

STANDING BARRE WORK (15 minutes)
Using a ballet barre (or sturdy chair), you'll focus even more on the glutes.  You'll start by using a playground ball (a squishy or Pilates ball also works) behind one leg for rear and side leg lifts.  Knight then has you take the ball away to continue working that same leg through various lifts and move called the ""twizzler,"" a pulsing move where the leg is first crossed over top of the bottom leg (as in Eagle pose in yoga), then lifted up and behind to the rear.  Before switching to the other side, you'll do a unique sequence of plies, including with the knees together and again adding in variations such as alternating heel lifts.

STRETCH (1.5 minutes)
A super-fast stretch segment concludes the routine; all of the stretches are held for <10 seconds, so this section didn't feel particularly relaxing or beneficial to me.  The stretches include standing Figure 4 stretch, standing quad stretch, and standing hamstring stretch.

After my long wait to try this workout, I was disappointed.  The loud music felt jarring to me, not energetic, and while the moves were fast-paced, they didn't serve to boost my heart rate at all.  Given this, the total effect was a routine that simply felt frenetic and disorganized.  I particularly did not like that Knight spends so much time on one side before finally switching back to the other.  Also, she does not mirror cue, which is not usually a problem for me, but which I think she actually made MORE confusing by her style of cuing out every transition (she could have easily cued front-back leg rather than right-left to simplify matters).  Because of all of the above factors, I did not even feel like I got a particularly good workout from this routine.

Obviously, people love the Physique 57 method, and their DVDs are highly rated by others.  Even as an high intermediate exerciser, however, I found that this style was not for me.",1414886400,5,5082,5.457800511508951
6247056,5,B00I0YHPLA,"I must admit, I was reluctant to try this workout since I have an (unreasonable) thought that if a workout isn't 60 minutes long, its not worth doing.  Well, I was proved wrong with this little gem!

I think this workout is harder than the 60 minute ones from P57.  Why?  Because there is absolutely no down time; you are moving continuously for 30 minutes.

Each time I do this workout, I try to decide if Shelley or Tanya talks quicker.  Its a toss up.  And its also a way to distract me from the pain of the workout.  Shelley leads this workout, while Tanya leads the full length workouts.

There is minimal equipment needed for this workout.  All you need:  a chair, mat and a playground ball.  And, as with all the P57 workouts, there are modifiers showing both easier and more advanced variations of the moves.  Even though I consider myself an advanced exerciser, guess which modifier I was following?  And even then, I found the moves challenging!

The workout:

WARM UP (2 minutes)
Its the typical barre warm up, with core work as a part of this.  I love doing core work as part of my warm up, since it really heats up the entire body.

LEG WORK (12 minutes)
Youll be doing typical barre moves, e.g. leg extensions, plies and the like.  This is all done without equipment.

BACK OF THE BODY (15 minutes)
Youll use a chair and playground ball for this section.  My favorite move is the one where you stand on one leg and bring the other leg to wrap around it (eagle style); you then bring that leg behind you.  Its a fun variation on the eagle pose from yoga.

STRETCH (2 minutes)
My favorite stretch, the figure 4, is here.  I really feel this deep in my hips and it feels great!

So even if you have limited time to workout, you can do this and really feel the burn!",1403395200,9,1776,4.325227963525836
6247057,5,B00I0YHPLA,"This was thirty minutes of hard work.  I felt this in my glutes, thighs, calves and oddly enough my core.  There was one exercise that was very interesting.  It involved pinning both my thighs to knees together and standing with both feet away from each other.  Once in this position, I did tiny pulsed squats. It worked my inner thighs and my outer glutes.  I will be doing this again.  My husband happened to be home while I was working out and he found the instructor's voice annoying.  I thought she sounded fine to me.  Shelly gives a nice tutorial on some of the moves in the introduction.  I think it is worth watching to appreciate the thought put into the design of this workout.  I did sweat a ton in thirty minutes so I definitely felt worked out.",1392422400,9,758,4.388489208633094

8638174,5,B00I0YHPLA,"I am relatively new to Physique 57, and I thought I would get this and the Arm + Ab Booster to work in with my classic DVD workout.  Shelly has great cueing.  I like the music better on the classic DVD, but it is not that important since the workout goes by so fast.

I plan on working this in, doing with this and the Arm + Ab booster as an alternate to the full 57 minute workout.  I did have to stop a few times with this, as my legs were really cramping up.  But after a quick rest I was ready to go again.

I will post an update after a few months.",1487462400,,553,3.765217391304348

8638180,2,B00I0YHPLA,"Am I missing something?I am an excercise DVD fanatic and bought the Physique 57 dvd's based on all the great reviews. Let me start out by saying I do workouts by Tonique,Tracy Anderson,Squeeze,And they just blow these workouts away. Not only did I find the instructors annoying,I found this workout to feel more of a warm up then a workout. I guess I'm spoiled,having done Sylwia Weisenberg's workouts ,I almost feel that other lower body workouts are pointless",1428710400,3,461,4.923076923076923
8638181,5,B00I0YHPLA,This is a wonderful DVD! It works your legs and butt really well. Cannot say enough great things about physique 57! The cardio element keeps your heart rate up while you tone everything,1424476800,,185,4.636363636363637
8638182,5,B00I0YHPLA,"I did this today and loved it. I'm an avid barre workout fan, because they work and they work fast to change your body. At first I didn't like the Physique 57 workouts because they move very fast. Other barre workouts based on the Lotte Berk method work a body part and then deeply stretch the muscles and ligaments which I love, but some days I want something more aerobic and Physique 57 raises the heart rate...especially this one. Its harder than the 57 minute programs as its non-stop buns and thighs and I will probably be very sore tomorrow. I stretched more at the end of the workout, because I am older and can get very stiff. The instructor is very good and talks very fast which doesn't get on my nerves at all. I still love my other barre workouts...they calm me down better than yoga. All barre workouts tone you up and increase your strength without the bulk. Also my knees are doing better and better which I credit to barre workouts.",1420934400,7,949,4.428571428571429
