8193635,5,B000PWQP7U,"I love Jam.  It's about a bunch of people who are completely different from each other all get caught up in a traffic jam on a small road somewhere and -though it may come off like a comedy story- eventually the people start talking to each other while waiting for help to arrive (to clear the road) and, in the process get to know each other really well.

They get to know each other so well in fact, that many of the people start developing feelings and relationships for each other.

Now the storyline is of course exaggerated, and there IS plenty of comedy bits throughout the movie involving some impossible to believe situations involving complete strangers getting to know each other much MUCH faster than normal people do in reality, but there's also a serious drama side to all the situations that occur as well.

It's not ALL about complete strangers developing love relationships with each other while stuck in the traffic jam and free to leave their vehicles to roam about- many of the people talk to each other about other kinds of serious situations such as, for example, the one kid who comes off like a punk and finds out his father has a terrible disease, and the two women who kick the door open to someones house so there's a resting place for the one woman who's having a baby to lay down.  These are just a few of the storyline bits that build and tell a good story.

I don't know, the thought of developing friendships and relationships with people who are complete strangers alongside the road waiting for someone to come along and take care of the people responsible for the traffic jam (and thus, forcing the people to stay put) is a great idea for a storyline in a film.  I liked the concept, and the movie is quite good.",1248307200,2,1747,4.492113564668769

It's really hard to give this movie a bad rating cause it's apparent the intentions were good, but alas... The story revolves around 15 people -many of which just don't matter to the story- who get hung up on a dirt road after the front car is rear ended setting off a live electric wire. While waiting for the authorities to arrive, the respective groups of people -each with dirty laundry and problems aplenty- undergo revelations and bond with eachother out of empathy, obligation, and sheer boredom. The main issue with this movie is that the plot -aside from a few dramatic components- is quite dry and gives the viewer the feeling that he or she is actually stuck in this mess with nothing to do but watch people bicker. The actors -which were all new to me- had no chemistry to speak of, but they certainly tried to fake like they did, being overly obsequious or extremely rude before warming up to the others by the movie's end. Best way to sum this film up is to say that it's like one of those ""Coexist"" bumper stickers. That's not to say that the ending is all sunshine, or good for that matter. I certainly didn't feel enlightened by this one cause quite frankly it was too cheesey, but if you're looking for an adult movie with family-movie like acting and characters, then this one is right up your alley, and you are welcome to it.",1185753600,6,1517,4.460431654676259
