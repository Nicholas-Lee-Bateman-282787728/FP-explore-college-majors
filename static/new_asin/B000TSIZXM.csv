2909117,5,B000TSIZXM,I read the books and loved the video.  It is sure to be a hit with young and young at heart horse lovers.,1273104000,4,105,3.5652173913043477
2909118,5,B000TSIZXM,"Heartland is a wonderful family drama with something for all ages. The scenery is stunning, filmed in the Canadian Rockies. The characters are well developed and believable. There are no paragons here, all of the main characters have their flaws but all are likable. The writing and acting are superior for a family drama series, with the ""troubled"" horses often reflecting their troubled owners.",1259452800,9,396,5.203125
2909119,5,B000TSIZXM,"I was sooo excited to see they have started selling this to the US now! I've have been an avid Heartland TV watcher- I was it on youtube- season three has just started premiered (they film in Canada I think) so I can say this series is an absolute success! I read all of the books when i was younger and they do differ from the TV series (new character added, mostly riding western but some english, new horses added) but they follow the general idea of a healing place for horses and people. Even if you've never read the books you can still jump right into the series as well (and you should read the books too there great)! and if you've read the books you'll love it! definitely my favorite TV show to watch!! If your not sure about buying it check out a preview on youtube and you'll love it- good for kids(10/11 + I'd say), teens, and everyone really",1254700800,11,856,4.257668711656442

8210556,4,B000TSIZXM,"This series is a collection of quasi Outer Limits style episodes, inventive, well done and interesting, I enjoyed this a lot.
They're short, 5 minute stories, so if you like that sort of thing, you may enjoy this.

I found out accidentally about a short-run series on tv called Heartland Horrors, and what intrigued me about it is the complete lack of information on it... for instance, IMDB has no listing, and Amazon's listing has zero reviews!",1370736000,2,446,4.792207792207792
8210557,5,B000TSIZXM,"I love this show, I started watching the season 3 or 4 so I wanted to see it from the beginning, encouraging, family oriented show, I am a country girl at heart so I relate to it. All the characters are great, if you haven't seen this yet, watch a show, you just might fall in love with it as I did.",1367712000,2,299,3.838709677419355
8210558,5,B000TSIZXM,"I was so excited when i found out that the books had been turned into a tv show only to find out it was only aired in canada.  Well now that it is on DVD i am happy to say i have seen every episode to date and complete awesome show.  Good for all ages and something for everyone.  Really horse stuff for those of us who know and are bugged by the ""fake"" horse information.  Pretty horses, amazing characters and gripping story lines.  each episode will have you in your seat wanting to know what happens next.",1345161600,,509,4.153061224489796
8210559,5,B000TSIZXM,"We happened across this on our Netflix and watched all 45 episodes and were crushed when that's all they had on line.  I just ordered the 3rd and 4th complete season an cannot wait to continue on.  Beautiful countryside and witty characters.  Modern day ranching.  Great writing, I love Mallory and Jake!  All the characters are likeable and really seem to be cowboys and girls in real life.  The horses are great actors too.",1342396800,4,425,4.675675675675675
