8302533,5,B001FRNBBW,"Please allow me to state that I have been a professional photographer
of women since 1975. This background does influence my review of
this dvd.

As someone who has never subscribed to the Playboy channel, this
series was unknown to me before I came across the dvds on Amazon.
The premise intrigued me and I purchased this title.

""California Girls"" consists of six episodes featuring two women per episode.
The location is the San Francisco area. The episode titles are:

I. California Girls
II. Sex and the City
III. San Francisco Treats
IV. Count me In!
V. The Beat Goes On
VI. Bon (or Buon) Appetito

Andrew Einhorn, a photographer based in New York City, travels to
the San Francisco Bay Area in search of candidates for his photography
books of ""everyday"" women in natural environments. Along for the
journey is a film crew. The series shows Mr. Einhorn approaching
various women in public to ask if they would like to be a part of
his photography. We are shown the rejections and the acceptances.
Of course, as any photographer knows, the simplest way to find
willing models is when one contacts you by e-mail. Such is the
case with Ruby, age 22, in episode VI. For me, Ruby's personality
and physical appearance justify owning this dvd. She is delightful.

As a photographer who has worked with non-professional models
for nearly forty years, I enjoyed this dvd. I'm not certain others
would enjoy it as much. If nudity is all that one is interested in
there are probably countless videos that are more abundant and
explicit than what is presented here - and women who are more
the stereotypical model for mens' magazines or adult videos (I
have practically no knowledge of the latter). I prefer the ""everyday""
natural woman who is not glammed up, surgically enhanced, or
covered with tattoos and body piercings (other than ears). Though
Naked Happy Girls California Girls features more women than I
would want who are tattooed and pierced, the settings and their
exuberance for the photography project makes the body art tolerable
(for me). It depicts one photographer's quest to produce material for
his books. And it requires both a model and a photographer in that quest.

Mr. Einhorn's personality is pleasant and likeable. I respect that
he reveals the rejection he faces as he approaches strangers in
public asking them to pose nude. What I fail to understand is his
sometimes persistence with a woman after she initially tells him NO.
Those of us who have sought models for decades quickly learn
rejection and let it go fast when it occurs. It is futile to pursue the
matter with anyone who says she's not interested. When Mr. Einhorn
persists with one woman on the street she says ""Get away from me,
I don't do that."" That is not how a professional photographer should
behave when asking someone if she would like to model for him. And
I hope with maturity and experience that Mr. Einhorn learns to take the
first ""no"" as a final answer (or perhaps it's all merely done for the
camera crew's capturing of the encounter). Either way, it is bad form.

In addition to the women modeling, the dvd includes some history and
scenic information about the area at the beginning of each model's segment.
As someone who lived in San Francisco in the late 1970s, I find this enjoyable.
There is a sense of place, and one can get an idea about a specific woman
inhabiting this environment.

The dvd box states the total running time is 156 minutes. That is probably
accurate although I did not time each episode. Therefore, there is a lot
of viewing time for the purchase price. That factors into my overall rating.

This is a type of video that appeals to me due solely to my profession as a
fine-art photographer. I've spent decades working with ""ordinary"" women
creating photographs. My style is not ""Playboyesque"" or pinup glamour. Andrew
Einhorn is depicting similar women who likely have no aspirations to ever be
a professional model. Therefore, my background plays a significant part in my
assigning this dvd the highest rating. I hasten to caution that many people will
not enjoy this dvd if they are expecting retouched, plastic dreamgirls with
elaborate sets that Playboy has popularized.

I purchased my dvd in 2011 at a price below the original retail listed price.
I believe I got good value for my dollars. The highlights for me on this dvd,
other than the travelogue information on the SF Bay Area, are the segments
with Malisia, age 29, in her apartment, Xiang Hua, age 21, in her
apartment, Ruby, age 22, in a vineyard, Christine, age 21, in a restaurant.

All twelve women in this dvd are comfortable with their nudity and to
varying degrees are playful and fun. Andrew Einhorn creates a relaxed
atmosphere for his models to be themselves. And with an accompanying
film crew that is certainly not an easy task. I applaud work like this
that celebrates the inherent sexiness of women without elaborate
locations or makeup or styling. These are actual women enjoying the
opportunity to reveal their bodies and beauty to the public.
