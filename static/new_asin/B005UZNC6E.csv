8487209,2,B005UZNC6E,"In the early 1930s, whether A grade or second unit, WARNER BROS. was noted for their no-nonsense fast-paced films that usually clocked in around 70 minutes. Brief running times meant no room for character development, foreshadowing or excessive set-ups. This cut-all-the-fat style worked well for their often breathless gangster pictures, but it's a major hindrance to character-driven melodramas like HOUSEWIFE (1934), which even if allowed an extra ten minutes would not have been anything near a classic.

It moves along too briskly and the story especially falls apart in the last two reels. ""A"" quickly leads to ""B"" which immediately brings on ""C"" then ""D"" so fast the viewer isn't allowed to digest any dramatic possibilities. You can almost sense that ""keep it under budget and let's finish this thing now"" was the overriding concern.

Sadly wasted here is Ruth Donnelly, who in future WARNER films would prove to be one of the greatest comediennes of her day. In HOUSEWIFE Ruth only serves as a brief voice of caution, then she's gone. George Brent seems to be putting in a day's work and nothing more. In fairness, his role is for the most part not of a man one would like to see a ballgame with. He's a whining wet blanket who succeeds in spite of himself. His most obvious personality trait is a constant intransigence that stays with Brent to his last line of dialogue.

Bleach blonde-era Bette Davis is merely adequate as the ladder-climbing homewrecker and John Halliday's suave but late-to-the-party alternative to Brent hasn't a chance to find love with central character Ann Dvorak, even if she DOES divorce Brent, a punishment he well deserves. Further, in this definite woman's picture Dvorak is the brains behind her wayfaring husband. The only mystery here is why she stands by for so long and permits Brent's dalliances with Davis.

BTW, there is nothing salacious in this one. Although in hindsight pitched as a daring pre-Code love triangle, HOUSEWIFE is ultimately tepid, too predictable and way too quick to wrap things up.",1437955200,2,2049,4.982456140350878
8487210,5,B005UZNC6E,Bette as always is quite watchable but Ann Dvorak is very interesting as the suffering wife. Dated theme for modern audience but I enjoyed it.,1434067200,,142,4.72

8487213,3,B005UZNC6E,"I am a huge fan of the films of the thirties.  Love the decor, the terrific actors two of which are George Brent and Bette Davis.  This one disappointed me.  I ordered it never having seen it simply on the credits of these two amazing stars who have wowed me in so many other films, ""The Great Lie"" ""Jezebel"" and ""Dark Victory.""  This 1934 offering was struggling from the start.  The only character I really rooted for was Ann Dvorak's.  She plays Nan the long suffering strength behind her man.  George Brent is Bill Reynolds, who constantly whines throughout the film and without Nan's confidence behind him you get the feeling he would be selling pencils on the street.  She saves the money for him to start his own advertising business and he becomes a success.  Enter Bette Davis, the highly paid career woman that allures him into an affair.  You see Bill is quite the follower.  Unable to have enough character to appreciate his wife, he even stands by and watches his wife be pursued by Mr. Duvey, the owner of the cosmetic company that is his largest account.  After accidentally running over his own little boy, he wants to stay at this point when Nan finally kicks him out.  She has a lot of class when Bette calls after the accident and Nan replies, 'Bill will be right over.'  Then in the divorce preceedings, Bill finally discoves he wants Nan back, and yes, she runs into his arms.  Davis is a great actress, and she and Dvork keep this film from being a total waste of time, but by the end when most women would have kicked Bill to the curb, took him to the cleaners in the divorce and moved on, Nan welcomes him with open arms.  Only in 1934 maybe.  Still I must say, Bette and Ann Dvorak are amazing.  George Brent didn't have much of a character to work with, but he muddled through.  If you are a rabid fan of Bette, you will like it, but if you really want to enjoy Brent and Davis, try any of the three films I mentioned before or ""In This Our Life.""",1325203200,12,1973,4.3561643835616435
