8021254,5,B00023BMIY,"Pedro Infante and Marga Lopez are two of my mother's favorite actors and this movie one of her favorite complete box of Kleenex tearjerkers, they along with the supporting cast give incredible performances. My family recently re-watched this after finding and buying it on amazon courtesy Nathan Godwin and there was not a dry eye in the house, we're aware of the sequel Ahora Soy Rico but since we all got invested in the characters as well as their joys, struggles and pain, we don't want to taint the memory of Pedro Infante's loving husband and father with his complete 180 degree turn in said sequel. The DVD has no special features and the image is not 100% flaw free but given the age of the film it's very good quality nonetheless.",1344384000,4,739,4.606060606060606
