775269,5,6304088205,Wow! I would like to thanks first the person ( my friend ) who gave me this movie as a birthday gift. I don't really cares about watching this kind of movie but one day I don't have anything to do at home being alone so I played the movie (DVD) and watched it. I like this movie especially the actor's did a good job even I don't understand the words or the language at least a subtittle movie. I wish I can find more movie like this and I heard that they have more filipino movies made the same but different story. Thank you! Buy this movie very interesting.,995587200,10,560,4.1
775270,3,6304088205,"It is an exploitation vehicle but rises above the treacle to make you see how morality becomes an impossibility in a deeply-rotten society. Stark and gripping,it details the plight of three brothers who became strip dancers for gay bar. It  is graphic in its depiction of a society already on the throes of a breakdown -of people desperately clinging for the little shred of hope that remains - of doing what they  can to survive. But there are also tender moments that redeem the characters from the hell they find themselves in.",980899200,9,530,4.75

775369,4,6304088205,"Well acted. I liked the emotional tie to family as the brothers did what they had to do to make ends meet. Harsh and violent at times, but the director did not try to sugar coat reality.

It tries to pose as being an intellectual, insightful movie full of angst, irony and meaning.  Instead,the story line, if any, is weak, and has illogical character development, etc.  I couldn't get past the first 45 minutes of it, unable to see the rest.

That being said, it's about as good as a decent student film can get, and the narrative needs work.  Worst of all is that the synopsis was entirely misleading.  It is always interesting, however, to see how gays and lesbians are portrayed on film in other countries.",1411344000,,407,4.785714285714286

775553,5,6304088205,"First let me warn you that there should be a health warning attached to this film.  Why? There is so much pulchritude (some call it eye candy or sugar candy) that you may have to see your dentist after savoring all that sweetness and beauty.  Now to the theme of the film.  It takes places place in Manila where work is hard to find for young men and to earn money they go into the business of ""Macho Dancers"" in gay bars.  The reason for the dancing of course is to show off their wares to the customers who see them as ""rent boys"" (as they call them in Korea) and we all know what that involves, don't we.  The story is about three brothers who are in the business.  Joel is married and has a child.  Dennis who love the action on the streets and belongs to a gang as well ad there is Sonny who had to drop out of school for lack of money.  We see what life is for them.  You see that some patrons treat them decently.  Some are abusive and violent.  Most consider them just a a piece of meat.  The problem arises when they take in a street kid who turns out to be bad news and they toss him out but later comes back to haunt them.  Dennis and two of his buddies get caught stealing a car by some corrupt cops.  It turns out bad for them  One is shot.  Dennis is carved up with a large jungle blade and the last who is a witness is also killed.  These corrupt cops find out that the street kid was living at their home so the go there and beat up their mother.  Dennis and Sony go after them and get their revenge.  But what do they do after?  Where can they go?  Watch the movie and see.  I rate this film 5 stars",1404950400,,1616,3.953416149068323

775621,3,6304088205,"It was watchable, but lacked a sustainable story line, in IMHO.  The acting was o.k. and have to admit, the guys were attractive but seemed to lack the chemistry needed to make me feel any empathy for them. It seems Philippine movie makers have to get over their somewhat prudish handling of sex scenes between men;not looking for porn, but emotional responses to sexual attraction.",1387756800,,382,4.876923076923077

775625,5,6304088205,I wanted to find a DVD that had male dancers. I saw this on Amazon and really enjoyed it. It shows how the guys got started dancing to make tips in Thailand. Their movements are very sensual compared to American male dancers.,1254182400,,225,4.380952380952381

to young men that get to carried away with things.

775627,4,6304088205,"This film is not a typical Gay & Lesbian-themed film. There are predominant Gay themes in this story, which are treated with dignity and sensitivity. As well, there are some sexually explicit parts and some poorly choreographed violence. Ultimately though, this is a story about survival where people have to look out for their survival and their families by themselves, while they struggle with the unforgiving, decieving reality in which they are trapped. The main theme doesn't use the issue of sexuality as the sole, main backdrop.
Having Filipino background certainly helped in understanding the cultural influences and the dynamics in this film. Main examples are shown in the characters' obligation to family, some of the unorthodox ideas of sexuality and the common cultural clashes between one's common values and survival.. While it's portrayals shouldn't be generalized towards the Filipino culture as a whole, the overall depiction is equal parts honest, disturbing and moving.. and also as one reviewer previously mentioned; ultimately depressing..
With that said, this film is not for everyone. The subtitling is a little bit incomplete in parts, the pacing is a little bit slow and and the Filipino themes may evade some people. If you can get past that, you may find it to be an intense, worthwhile experience..",1055808000,17,1327,5.234741784037559
775628,3,6304088205,"It's erotic, it's sexual, it's violent and ultimately depressing.
It's the classic tale of prostitution stealing one's soul in the end--Filipeno style.  Three brothers choose to work in a gay bar as male prostitues. They find this is the best way to make a quick buck. Everyone in the family knows about it.
Mom , dad, one of the boy's is married with a wife and kid and she knows about it. And she is  fine. She even meets his male lover with open arms. How amazingly accepting to their circumstances.
There is a lot of heartbreak in this movie. The actress playing the mother is wonderful and your heart goes out to her.  Much more said would give to much away.
There is a great display of Asian Beefcake-- but since the message is one of prostitution ruining one's life and soul --the erotica goes out the window.  Still an interesting honest portrayal of desperate people and male prostitution in the Phillipines.",1015027200,17,917,4.607361963190184
