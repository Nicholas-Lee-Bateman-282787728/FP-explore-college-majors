8611777,1,B00F2T7SZ4,"It has been a tradition for my son and I to watch Christmas movies (mostly cartoons) as soon as Halloween ends through New Years. We were so excited when we received this one in the mail, because it looked to be one that we would really enjoy. I can not express how very disappointed that we were. It seemed as though it mocked Christianity. Needless to say, I threw it away because I wouldn't want to pass that junk on to anyone!",1408320000,3,430,4.2560975609756095

8611779,1,B00F2T7SZ4,"It may be colorful and well done, like other reviewers have said, but anyone that has kids won't be putting those attributes first when looking for a good Christmas movie for their kids.  It has unkind attitudes, name-calling (brat, idiot, dimwit, etc) & inappropriate comments (one character is trying on a pitcher for a hat and one of the guards is oogling her chest... she says, ""I'm trying on a pitcher not a push up bra!"").  That is the second time in the movie that a sexual innuendo is made (and others continue).  I know those kinds of things are in other movies, too (Shrek, etc), but this one is very blatant.  It also has the Nativity Scene ""world"" pitted against the Santa ""world"" - and their aggression towards each other is portrayed kind of violently - not funny at all.  Lastly, another inappropriate part is when some soldiers are interrogating the Three Wise Men & a guard reaches into the back end of each of the camels.  The camels groan with discomfort each time - kind of gross.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone.  I didn't find it interesting or funny on an adult level either.",1387584000,13,1112,4.552763819095477
8611780,5,B00F2T7SZ4,"I may be a bit biased in my review, but I must say that I was really impressed with the quality of animation in this film.  It is not your typical, low-budget animation film.  The colors are bright and the story is fun and feels like it was made by a studio.  I am always on the lookout for good family movies and this one worked for me.  If you have kids, I highly suggest you rent HOLY NIGHT, especially if you are looking for something around the holidays.",1382918400,4,459,4.123595505617978
