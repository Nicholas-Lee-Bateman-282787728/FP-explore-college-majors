8495305,5,B0069HEDRY,My granddaughter loves this DVD.  She sits raptured till the end.  There is one particular song that catches her ear more than the others.  I hum her to sleep with her special song.,1387843200,,181,4.424242424242424
8495306,5,B0069HEDRY,My daughter is 15 months old and she's been watching Baby Einstein videos since about 8 months. She loves all of them. This is a favorite because we can show her the same animals at the zoo!,1380844800,2,190,4.162162162162162
8495307,5,B0069HEDRY,"I love the animal baby einsteins. My daughter will sit for hours watching this dvd over and over again. Soothing music, fun animals, what's not to like? I would recommend this to others.",1380067200,,186,4.666666666666667
8495308,5,B0069HEDRY,Good quality video. It kept my infant entertained. Novel concept; the music and imagery presented in a soft and educational family friendly manner.,1379721600,,147,5.434782608695652
8495309,5,B0069HEDRY,We own 3 Baby Einstein dvd's . They are my grandsons favorites. But this is the one he asks for first. He doesn't sit still for other childrens programs but usually does for this one. He loves the animals.,1372377600,,205,4.282051282051282
8495310,5,B0069HEDRY,"My two year old granchildren love this.  I (or their mother or father) sit with them and talk about what the animals are doing, so it's an interactive experience, and not a babysitter.  It's very well done.",1360281600,,206,4.54054054054054
8495311,5,B0069HEDRY,My 8 month old is now 18 months old and this is still his favorite. It's also mine as the music is pleasant and the footage is educational. We bought a second when our first one got scratched. Worth it.,1360195200,,202,4.075
8495312,5,B0069HEDRY,I have a daughter with autism and she has been falling asleep to Baby Einstein for a couple of years now. She loves them and they have helped with her speech as well. They seem to calm her down and relax her.,1357603200,,208,3.9761904761904763
8495313,3,B0069HEDRY,"If you already own Baby Einstein World Animals and Baby Noah, do not bother getting this video! Unfortunately I did not read the small print at the bottom of the DVD cover; this video consists mostly of identical material taken from these 2 previously released videos - so my kids quickly got bored with this new one. I will be returning this video. Very disappointing.",1332547200,7,369,4.6923076923076925
