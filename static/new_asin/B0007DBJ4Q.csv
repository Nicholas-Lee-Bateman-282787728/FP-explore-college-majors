8047030,1,B0007DBJ4Q,"The girls here are pretty, I will admit that. BUt they all come out with their husbands and boyfriends and show very little for the camera. They about their experience on Fear Factor, which is not very fun cause most of these girls are bimbos who probably dropped out of college due to their low IQs. MOst of them are very snobby and try and pretend that they are giving you a very ""tasteful"" photo shoot, Which is BS cause they all have tattoos and are taking their clothes off in front of strangers in public.",1318636800,,511,4.333333333333333
8047031,2,B0007DBJ4Q,"The Fear Factor Gals are great looking nekkid- but the narrotor is the most annoying voice they could have possibly found.  A female narrator may have been better, but there's something pretty un-sexy about a narrator who sounds like a game show host talking over images of naked girls.",1166054400,5,286,4.836734693877551

8047033,1,B0007DBJ4Q,"If you just love Fear Factor and want to see lots of background material on the women and their Playboy magazine photo shoot, go ahead and buy this DVD. But be warned that there is probably more footage of their boyfriends or husbands than there is of them nude.",1115164800,37,262,4.36734693877551
