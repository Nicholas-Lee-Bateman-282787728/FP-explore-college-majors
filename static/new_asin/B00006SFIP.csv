7972931,1,B00006SFIP,"If ever there was a fraudulent acquisition, this is it. After waiting some weeks past its due by date, the parcel finally arrived. It did NOT contain what I ordered, the blue covered disc. My parcel did, in fact, contain a yellow, well worn cover that couldn't close properly (and still doesn't). It contained the book and a dirty, scratched cd. It was also supposed to contain a cassette tape. That was missing. After contacting the sender with my complaint, I heard nothing. Sending them another e-mail, I was told the item was the ""real thing"". Another e-mail from me was sent, threatening to inform Amazon of this fraudulent transaction and the non compliance of the sender. Two days later, an e-mail arrived from the sender, informing me that as it would cost too much money to return the item to them, they will refund my money. This they did. But, this was an abhorrent scam, a scam they no doubt were hoping to get away with. As it stands, I still, to this day, do not have what was listed on Amazon.",1387152000,,1008,4.5136612021857925
7972932,5,B00006SFIP,"This is an excellent DVD!!  I wish there were a read along DVD for every childrens story book. I agree with previous reviews that it does go a little fast, but my 6 year old who is learning to read said she likes it a lot and is learning words just from seeing them on the screen.  It would be great if they had different reading level options where it would go slower with simpler words and shorter story, but I think just seeing the words and hearing them helps the younger child anyway.  Great for busy working moms like myself.  I pick my child up from after school daycare and when we get home, I pop this in the DVD player and play it for her while I'm preparing dinner.  I think it has a better outcome than if I had read to her because she relates to the characters and can see the words as it is being read.  Disney, if you see this review, I think a good concept would be to put out other learning videos that corespond with your worbooks.  Like DVD flash cards with the princesses and different characters.",1232668800,,1017,4.184615384615385
7972933,3,B00006SFIP,"Captioning is a great way to teach children how to read. Unfortunetly, the captioning in this video is small and hard to read. Also, the words change sizes as they are being read. You would think this would make it easier to follow along but it doesn't - it just confuses things.

On the good side of things these are great stories, the characters are familiar to many children and the music videos are fun. The other languages are a bonus too.

Read-TV is a much better way to teach children to read through captions. The text is big and kid-friendly, the stories are sweet and the production values are great.",1120953600,2,611,4.495495495495495
