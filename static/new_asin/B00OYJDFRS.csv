6776400,5,B00OYJDFRS,I loved the movie! But i felt like a lot of things were left unmentioned for instance the part where the girl was raped by the guy we wanted to know who was his wife and did the girl kill her baby father chris for giving her hit? it almost made me feel like its going to be another part but i guess not.

6776446,3,B00OYJDFRS,I love the first 2 movies but this 3rd one was too dry. The story line got boring and no new (good) suspense was added to the story,1453161600,,131,3.7142857142857144
6776447,4,B00OYJDFRS,"Liked all 3, wish there was a 4th",1449014400,,33,3.25
6776448,1,B00OYJDFRS,"The film opens with Roni (Milon V. Parker) and Bree having a conversation in a car. We quickly discover Roni is a bad actor, and when I say bad, I don't mean good. We also discover in the first few moment that the dialogue also sucks.  We see a ball go into the street, a child chases it, a vehicle speeds up and yup, we have a drive-by shooting...child is okay, but I don't know how. It  seems the film loves gender bending and FFM love triangles so such on the south side, that there are two of them in the film. I was hoping for some real action in the strip joint, but this is one of those fictional places where the women don't undress while guys toss out wads of dollar bills onto the stage. Yes, this is so common place the dancers just leave them there and don't bother to gather them up. The film tosses scenes and characters at me that didn't seem to connect. The sound was uneven and whenever two people are alone in a car and talking, the conversation and acting becomes campy funny.

Guide: F-bomb. 1 sex scene. Near nudity.",1445904000,5,1037,4.2272727272727275

6776461,5,B00OYJDFRS,"Overall,  the lies we tell, but the secrets we keep has great story line.  It's never good to keep secrets or to keep lying about something from somebody you care about it.",1421539200,,172,4.34375
6776462,1,B00OYJDFRS,Extremely disappointed! Thought it would be much better. Too bad.,1421020800,,65,5.6
6776463,5,B00OYJDFRS,"Hard core Female portraying thug inter-city male's? The acting of urban masculinity was brilliantly played.. I don't know if some these female actor's was channeling the character or they where portraying them self's... If you tell to many lie's.. Then you forget what you said.. If hold on to many secret's, then you end up loosing all touch of reality..",1420502400,2,355,4.933333333333334

6776467,2,B00OYJDFRS,"I just knew that it would be a great last part of a 3 sequel movie. I had my expectations too high, loved part 1 and 2 now this one was alright. It really could have been better they could have ellaborate more on the story. How did Bri just all of a sudden just be in the bed making love when she was just in the hospital bed? They could have had her recovering or something just up and alive in bed and everything else. I believe it was just a rush to get it over and done with i really wish it was better.",1419292800,3,507,3.792452830188679

8685340,5,B00OYJDFRS,I loved every last one of her movies. I was almost about to cry at the end until I sat there a bit longer and found it that it really didn't happen but they moved on and lived happily ever after. I have to say that I love seeing the LGBT community come up and hit it hard in the industry. If you have not seen all 3 sequels you are sleeping on Milon baby she is great at what she does and I can't wait to see what other movies she comes out with.,1529452800,,446,3.705263157894737

8685348,5,B00OYJDFRS,"Finally the happy ending I was looking for. I loved the first movie it was so real and very well done. Then part two was good, but had me mad at the end. I thought man these two just can't catch a break! I saw them on YouTube, and then found out Part 3 was on here, and was so happy to hear that. Talented Writers, and Cast. I look forward to more projects from yall, and would love to network with yall real talk. I went to LAFS and ARB. The character that plays Bri reminds me of a lady names Vanity who played in the movie Action Jackson she reminds me so much of her. Are they related by chance? Well great work ladies and gentlemen. I wish to see more LGBTQ content on TV one day. More than what we see now, but slowly I see more prime time shows writing in more LGBTQ characters, and that's great. If you all work out a series that would be awesome. For now I get my fix on Netflix with OITNB, but would love to see a The Lies We Tell, But The Secrets We Keep Series.",1494547200,,973,3.919191919191919
