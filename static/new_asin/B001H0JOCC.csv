8307588,5,B001H0JOCC,"Matt Berry's mock rock opera tells the familiar tale of the nativity from the Innkeepers point of view.  Parodying 70's rock operas, particularly Jesus Christ Superstar, it looks like a forgotten gem of the era... done so well some might take it as a serious effort from the time.  While only 30 minutes in duration the sheer epicness of the tale leaves you feeling like you experienced something much more.

Staring some of the cream of the current Britcom crop.  Familiar faces from 'The Mighty Boosh', 'Nathan Barley', 'Little Britian', 'Nighty Night', 'IT Crowd' and even a cameo from Graham Linehan whose writing credits include 'Father Ted' and 'IT Crowd'.

As for the DVD itself (Region 2 version) includes The Score and a 'lost interview' with Tim Wynde the composer of AD/BC (played by Berry).",1229731200,2,802,4.911111111111111
