8186516,5,B000OSOLN0,"Well this a great DVD if your a huge O fan.
You get to see what he is like as a regular person and also what he is like as a perfomer.
There a good part of this DVD where Omarion is just talking about stuff, u know like life, music, God.
Some of it is interesting, other parts u get to hear he has a sorta funny side.
Also on this dvd the forgot to mention that u get BET behind The Scenes Footage of ""Touch"" with the lovely Danielle Polanco
as the lead lady in the video.
Which is what I didn't even think would be on here. Its pretty dope to watch it !
This DVD is way old now but, if u wanted to know more about O's personality and who he as a person, its worth the purchase.",1302134400,,678,3.7482517482517483
