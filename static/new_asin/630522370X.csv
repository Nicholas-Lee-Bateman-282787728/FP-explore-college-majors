7887445,4,630522370X,"I appreciate the movie TAR, I'm really feeling the soundtrack. It would've been better with more appearences of Ron Brice! I overstand TAR because it's on the contrary to the average white supremist Bulls**t! I really love ''Ron Brice'',I wish that most of you people would stop sleeping on his great talent!!  1 LOVE...nj",1116633600,,322,4.962962962962963

7887447,4,630522370X,"This was a wonderful movie to watch.  My opinion may be biased because I am a huge fan of Kevin Thigpen.  Kevin is a brilliant actor and a good friend of mine, who unfortunately, isn't widely known.  He gave a fine performance in this film as Curtis Brisby.  This is definitely one to have in your video library.",978480000,2,312,4.327586206896552
