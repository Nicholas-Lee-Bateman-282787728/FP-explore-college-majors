3872003,5,B00287Z1DE,Easier to buy these then collect off cable. Getting them in order helps the series make more sense. Looking forward to getting the rest,1355788800,,135,4.666666666666667
3872004,5,B00287Z1DE,"Like all pokemon movies and series, this one is cute and fun to watch with people of all ages. I always like the bonds they have with the pokemon, and those that they catch along the way. Great Product for all ages!",1279756800,,215,4.142857142857143
3872005,5,B00287Z1DE,"I have been a fan of Pokemon since the start, and during all that time, I have recorded week-by-week, each and every episode, while hoping that someday I'd get to see an official release of the uncut, uncensored original Japanese Pocket Monsters episodes with English subtitles, as I've read online about all the dialog changes, deleted scenes, paint-overs, and banned episodes. And as the tapes began to pile up in my collection, I always said I'd save my money for the subs, and that I'd never actually buy the English dubs. So in an age when my VCR(/DVD player combo) seems like it may be the only one left in the world, still my collection still consists of VHS recordings. But about halfway through last season (Battle Dimension), my VCR began to show its age and the recording were coming out with skips and lines on the screen, and even after recording many of the episodes over (including the newest Pokemon movie ""Giratina and the Sky Warrior"", which I also just purchased for the same reasons as the episodes listed below), it still seemed like both the tapes and the machine just wouldn't last forever.

Meanwhile, Pokemon DVD box sets of both the newest (Battle Frontier, Diamond & Pearl) and earliest (Indigo League) episodes were being released, and still no subtitles, which is so frustrating when there are aisles of other anime being sold with bilingual recordings (English/Japanese) in stores. I admit, I have seen a few fansubs online, and with the exception of Team Rocket's occasional (and annoying) ""self-awareness"" (or talking to the viewers) in English, the dub has become surprisingly accurate and in tact. Suddenly episodes like ""Crossing Paths"", ""Pika and Goliath"", ""Chim-Charred!"" (all from this box set) were some of the best I've seen in any language, and the thought the tapes (containing these and other recent episodes) becoming damaged had me asking for the first time, ""When did the dub get good?""

I do have to warn all potential buyers of the misinformation that is printed on the back of this Box Set (#2). Despite the mention of ""Pokmon Ranger"" and ""Hunter J"" on the box set (but strangely not the individual volumes that list the episodes), the two-part episode to which this refers ""Pokmon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu"" IS NOT INCLUDED ON THIS COLLECTION!! It was later released as part of the THIRD DP Battle Dimension Box Set (with Brock on the cover); volume 6 to be exact (the individual disc with Happiny on the cover).

REGARDING BOTH BOX SETS 2 and 3:
After being a Pokemon fan for so many years, DP Battle Dimension (season 11) was by far the best overall season yet. Our hero Ash's devotion and passion to protect Pokemon shines brighter than ever opposite his heartless rival Paul and cruel Pokemon hunter J...
these box sets worth every penny, in plain English.",1251417600,7,2815,4.824016563146998
3872006,5,B00287Z1DE,"Diamond and Pearl seasons I think are the best seasons since the original Johto League ones. Set 2 of Battle Dimentions has some of the best episodes among them with Ash and crew meeting a Pokemon magician, entering Brock's Crogunk into a contest, repeatingly trying to get a hometown gym battle only to have the gym leader always gone making the group finding other contests to be involved in like the fashion show or when Dawn and Ash's former battle frontier companion May battle it out for best corindator. Even some surprising bits like James and Brock agreeing on cordinator costumes and Jessie caring enough about her Pokemon to help Ash and the group help all pokemon in the area.",1251331200,4,688,4.741666666666666

I can't wait... I have many new sets due tomorrow....so in the end I will have them all! I am certain that younger people will like them very much - As for me, I am 50 and love watching them all!!! Enjoy! Regardless of your age, there will always be a kid inside, heh?  Kim",1375920000,,440,4.093023255813954
3872016,5,B00287Z1DE,"I can't wait to watch all of battle dimension! Even though they don't make complete season box sets, you can buy these at a reasonable price now. If you buy box sets 1, 2 and 3, then you will have all of Battle Dimension. On here, Amazon lists them as ""Vols. 1 & 2"" (which is all of BOX SET 1), then ""Vols. 3 & 4"" (which is all of BOX SET 2), followed by Box 3 (which is all of BOX SET 3). If you are a Pokemon fan and enjoy the anime and want to complete some dvd box sets, buy these. Like I said before, these are reasonably priced now. So enjoy!

Also, if you have Pokemon Indigo League (3 box sets), Orange Islands (1 box set), Master Quest (2 box sets), Advanced (2 box sets), Battle Frontier (2 box sets), and Diamond and Pearl (3 box sets) then you must have a lot of shelf room because all together these box sets do take up a lot of space. After you get through Galactic Battles (the next season after this) then the sets get thinner to save space.",1358035200,4,957,3.984375
