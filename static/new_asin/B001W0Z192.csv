8346860,5,B001W0Z192,This was a great depiction of the realities of social racist.  They work among us and shop along side of us but yet the believe they are better than us.,1374796800,2,152,4.066666666666666
8346861,5,B001W0Z192,"this is a very good and accurate view of how screwed up our politics are in this day and age. how we ever got to this point is beyond me. i believe that each party has good and bad wixed in, but for some republicans i know they truly believ e everything fox news says.",1335139200,3,268,3.890909090909091
8346862,5,B001W0Z192,"The most important issue to consider while watching this documentary is how unbiased and simply done it is.  Ms. Pelosi took a video camera to various John McCain rallies around the country during the 2008 presidential campaign and asked various people attending how they would feel if Barack Obama won, both as a Democrat but primarily as the first African American president.  The answers she received were straight forward... there didn't appear to be any manipulative editing going on -- just people's honest opinions.  This documentary is important.  While prejudice exists everywhere, the die hard base of the Republican Party seem to own the ""rights"" to ugliness in such a mainstream way.  It's unfortunate that this documentary shows the party in such a horrible light... but if the shoe fits...",1240358400,15,803,5.1461538461538465
8346863,5,B001W0Z192,"The media was so in love with Obama that they ignored the McCain campaign altogether - kudos to Pelosi for giving these republicans a voice! No matter who you voted for in this election, you could learn a lot about how heated and emotional elections get from watching this film.",1239926400,,278,4.58
8346864,5,B001W0Z192,"I showed this movie to my high school history class and the students learned a lot. As a civics instructor, I think it is noble that someone from a ""blue state"" went out and talked to people all across America, the mainstream media never does that. I am happy to see that someone cares enough to open the dialogue. Do not let the partisan bloggers fool you, this Pelosi is a great journalist!",1239926400,6,392,4.383561643835616
8346865,1,B001W0Z192,"I am very offended that my purchase of an episode of Firing Line illicited an email from Amazon that I might be interested in purchasing this sad excuse for a documentary. It seems that Amazon has it's own agenda. Bill Buckley = Nancy Peloci's daughter was a strange algorithim! It makes me want to stop purchasing things here.

Conservatives are so much more diverse than any on the left want to believe. It's so much easier to do ad hominem attacks than to discuss beliefs, morals, policy, etc. She even admits she was selective in her documentary title: ""Some Voices"", indeed these are ""some"" but not many! I'm vegan, a vaccine-delayer and a proud capitalist/conservative. Those might seem like non-sterotypical things, but that's what real conservatives are like. They are people with just as much variety as exists on the left who can all agree that government, when given too much power, and given control of the means of production, will eventually become totalitarian.

8346867,4,B001W0Z192,"Alexandra Pelosi is really good at making documentaries. This film is no exception. She captures the ""real american"" McCain/Palin supporters that, thank God, are forced to take a back seat for a few years. Man, these people are scary. I think it should be mandatory viewing for all Secret Service agents, just to remind them of the wack-jobs that are out there in ""Real America"". I am grateful that the majority of voters in America rejected the poison and narrow mindedness shown in this film, with 365 electoral votes, put a modern, energetic, intelligent and open minded man in the White House. When the idiots characterised in this film die off, this country can make some real progress. Until then, I'll pitty the ignorance.",1237939200,7,729,4.887096774193548
8346868,4,B001W0Z192,"... as our old Sicilian proverb translates. This documentary very difficult to sit through, but is also hypnotic as to not pull away .
The actual title SHOULD be ""Wrong America, Feeling Wrong as Usual"", a much more accurate title, as these folks interviewed seem ""WRONG""  in the purest definition of the word...

An hour of indictment of a very strange slice of USian life, with NO prejudice. (These poeple are their own ""publicists"", and there is no ""interfearence , PUN INTENDED, of the demonised Michael Moore or the ""Borat"" character)

Flags a-wavin', ""homosexuals"" and ""n-words"" a -flying, FEAR, tears and hatred without end, these are truely the people Neitzche would refer to as , in his frase, ""the bungled and the botched"".

THe blizzard of flags, I wonder if Ms Pelosi the director was trying to convey the notion that excessive flag waving is endemic to facista and totalitarian societies, and this ""red , white and blue which has shrinkwrapped these ""right wing moonbat's "" minds.

But note,  not as well conveyed by the so-called USian ""liberal media"" , the flag is also used as a  ceremonial death shroud for those US soldiers who have been killed in the two ill conceived ""wars against terror"". (a tip of the cap to Tom Tomorrow for the apellation ""moonbat"").  We don't see this display of flag by those who these right wing nust jobs suport so ardently, do we?

Indignant ""working folks"" decry Barak Obama as an urban ""elitista"", no mind John McCain is a scion of the ultra wealthy, Obama is an ""arab"", a ""socialista"", etc....when, in fact , Obama is quite a centerist democrat, as his cabinet appointment has since indicated.

NO room for fact with these crazyloucos, who many have professed to ""move to a different country"" if McPalin was not elected.

Bye bye, I say, although the countries they choose, SPAIN, the BAHAMAS, for example, do not seem likely to be the most comfortable for scared caucasian monoglots, but fantasy seems to fuel the day to day of these for whom to think must really hurt their ""brains"".

And they look pretty much like everyone else, more/less.

A sad sad commentary on ignorance, fearmongering, hatred and intolerance , live and in NOT SO LIVING COLOR (strange, but almost all the ""colorful"" participants are NOT ""people of color"".

Perverse with a capital ""E"", hahahaha

Gurdjeiff would also refer these cretini as ""those who walk the earth asleep"".

If this was not that these crazyloucos are the 100% item, this would be a good comedy.

As it stands, an indictment of the current USian way of life for FAR too many of its citizens.

I imagine this review will draw many negative feelings from people who have the same uninformed, and at times ignorant notions that this film's subject profess, so be it, I feel sorry for you all!

Shame on them, and it is troubling to see how many of these folks have the emotional depth of piss on a rock, sad sad sad

(Oh, and a lttle aside, The furor over Barak Hussein Obama's NAME and his alleged origins as an ""arab"", foreigner, terrorista, etc....Barak is a name common in ISRAEL, so it seems a bit silly to be so concernes about his ""eevil MOOSLIM"" middle and surnames. I wonder if these people who agreed to be interviewed feel any degree at all of embarassment in retrospect~~ I imagine there a certain element that is PROUD of their performance. They do walk among us, as the famous horror film clich says..)",1237420800,13,3405,4.700336700336701
