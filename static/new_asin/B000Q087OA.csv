From what I have pieced together, I believe this is the TV series that was supposed to be done as a sort of follow up of the MR Vampire movies. I had heard about it, heard that originally it was supposed to have Lam Ching Ying in it-the one eyebrow priest from the Mr Vampire movies. Only, he died before production was seriously underway. Similar in theme, at the very least and a fine companion to the movies that I enjoy so much. I only wish that it were subtitled in english as to not force me to rely on my only so-so ability to understand spoken Chinese. If you have ever seen the movie 'gravedigger,' which was apparently brought to dvd thanks to 'The Wu-Tang Clan-' yes the rappers. Maybe they will someday bring this and more out to the mainstream. Doubtful, but it is a thought. Decent enough show, strange to see the production value, made me feel like I was watching a soap opera from the states. Clean, but so different from most of the other movies I have based around this theme.

Well, thank you and take care. Fans of the Mr Vampire series should certainly look into this as well, provided you don't mind that there is no English dubbing or subtitles.",1287705600,,1180,4.408256880733945

If you love hong kong movies and series from the late 80s to early 90s, this is it! I highly recommend this series as you will watch it over and over once it is finished. It is definitely worth it!",1180396800,,327,4.2063492063492065
