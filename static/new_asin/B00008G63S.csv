7983042,5,B00008G63S,"I found this movies extremely pleasant to watch.

Outstanding fighting between the good guys and the bad guys made this really stick out.

The storyline was wonderful and well presented throughout the film mixed in with action scenes that made this a joy to watch.

The music/soundtrack was average, however it contributed to the films atmosphere and made a positive difference to the movie action scenes.

I personally taped this movie on VHS to watch again and I advise others to do the same.

I liked the idea of the Chinese and the Japanese against each other. It seems in this movie the Japanese were trying to take China over and there was a plot to do so with information on the army bases to attack. The good guys stop the information reaching the target and win the day.

I liked the guy known as Joker.",1525651200,,812,4.527397260273973

7983046,5,B00008G63S,"Fight scenes = awesome
dialogue = ridiculous
plot = unresolved

Any movie that ends with 40 minutes fight scene during which you forget the plot of the movie deserves a 5 star rating in my book.",1294358400,,194,4.388888888888889
7983047,3,B00008G63S,"aka HAND OF DEATH  , THE GOOD AND THE BAD ,HUNGRY TIGER & CRAZY DRAGON.Great movie,good action,lovely in widescreen BUT too many rope lines on picture. Rope line = caused by constant rewinding of 35mm or 16mm print. I guess they manage to find one last print in the archives and transfer it to dvd. Pricesy for bad transfer of dvd. Company should sell it for minimum $4.99",1079568000,5,372,4.470588235294118
