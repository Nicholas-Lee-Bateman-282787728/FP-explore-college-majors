447067,5,6302276594,"This is a rarely seen John Ford western, now available for rent or purchase via Amazon Instant Video.  Highly recommended.

Ford often said he disliked it, but no one is certain why, given how 'modern' it feels compared to other westerns; maybe because it allows James Stewart to continue his experiment playing anti-heroes that he initiated in Anthony Mann's 'neurotic westerns' of the 50s and 60s.  Stewart's portrayal of a mercenary US Marshall is almost shocking, even today.  And the structure of the script is sophisticated in how it lays out exposition in creative ways, usually driven by character, not by routine plot points.

What I find 'new' about it is the mix of humor and drama.  It takes the same historical sources as THE SEARCHERS and finds a fresh way to mix laughter and heartbreak.  And the racial/gender politics are nothing what you'd expect from such an older film.

The ambiguity and humor presages the style of American cinema in the 70s, where a comic first act softens up the audience for unexpected gut punches to follow.

Don't let the pacing keep you from watching it all the way through, uninterrupted.  The third act is full of payoffs and surprises.  Ford's respect for native cultures is made clear by the penultimate scene where the justice of white men is shown to be truly savage.",1433635200,,1318,4.8133333333333335
447068,5,6302276594,"The longer one lives, the more likely that person will be offered opportunities by friends only to be let down by those he is supposed to help. Marshal Guthrie McCabe (James Stewart) learns such a lesson when he is approached by Army Lt. Jim Gary (Richard Widmark) to help find and return whites who were taken captive by Commanches years earlier. Everyone's reactions, from the Commanches to the rescuers and those they rescue, produce unexpected results.
The only stereotypical behavior is from the whites who at best grudgingly accept those brought back from captivity and at worst hate them for their assimilation into Native American language, dress, and suspicion of white civilization. The dialog is unusual for a Western, often a mix of humor and cynicism. A few examples:
Lt. Gary: ""You going to build a fire? Why don't you just send up smoke signals?""  Marshal McCabe: ""Because I can't spell.""
Marshal McCabe: ""You trust me don't you?""  Chief Quanah Parker gives him a long hard stare and says: ""No.""
One of the reluctant returned captives is locked in jail so that whites can parade by him to try and identify him. The captive becomes angry and throws a bucket of water through the window. The one who is soaked says: ""What kind of Army do you have here?"" to the sergeant who restrains him. ""I'm a taxpayer.""
Stewart and Widmark were at the peak of their careers, at least as far as Westerns go, in Two Rode Together and Linda Cristal and Shirley Jones were up and coming actresses. Director John Ford manages to squeeze great performances from all the cast members, even when Stewart refused to take off the sweat stained cowboy hat that he had worn in previous movies and don one preferred by Ford.
Offbeat at times, an honest portrayal of human nature from start to finish, Two Rode Together is worth watching.",1431129600,,1824,4.750788643533123

447116,2,6302276594,"The story is basically fiction about the raid to recover Cynthia Ann Parker, the mother of Quanah Parker, the last chief of the Comanche people.
As others have said, the fantasy was better in Ford's The Searchers.  Sadly, neither do justice to the tragedy and pathos of the real event.
I could only compare the real story to a raid today to recover an American woman kidnapped by ISIS only to find she wanted to stay with them
because she had numerous Muslim children with them.  The hate we would have for her would be tragic and is what happened to Ms. Parker.
Realizing the power of the real story makes this movie pitiful in comparison.

Still, it is the John Ford stock company with Jimmy Stewart and Richard Widmark.  It is mostly a comedy with a little attempt to be serious
as are most of John Ford's movies after 1945. I am addicted to all of his comedies.",1419033600,,865,4.421383647798742

447122,4,6302276594,"John Ford was his own worst enemy on his 1961 western, Two Rode Together. He claimed only to have done the film as a favor to recently deceased Columbia boss Harry Cohn, having already done similar material much more successfully in The Searchers. He let everyone know that even after he brought in one of his most trusted writers Frank Nugent (who wrote The Searchers) that it was ""still crap"". Many would still agree that the earlier masterpiece (not to mention the one that followed it - The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance) do over-shadow Two Rode Together, but there is a growing band of people (among whom I stand) who think the film deserves more of a serious look. The film may appear flabby, non-eventful and unduly sentimental with a tendency for letting main characters shoot the breeze, but it's really about those old stock Ford themes, male camaraderie and the creation myth of the taming of the wild west through the establishment of community spirit.

The friendship between cynical Marshall McCabe (James Stewart) and upright cavalry officer Lieutenant Gary (Richard Widmark) is wrung through the mill as they journey into Comanche country to reclaim captives taken by the indians. What Ford gives us here is a frontier very different from the one depicted in The Searchers. In that film there was still an arcadian element to the Monument Valley settings with white settlers duly pitching in and helping each other out in God's garden. Two Rode Together posits a very different frontier riven with racism, fears of miscegenation and wholly hypocritical in its religious standing. This is very well shown in the relationship that develops between McCabe and Elena (Linda Cristal). Initially convinced that reclaiming captives is a waste of time (he only does it for the money), McCabe falls for the Mexican Elena and learns the hypocrisy of the white community when he tries to integrate her into it during a classic Fordian hoe-down. This is possibly the best sequence of the film which shows Ford's very real concern for people showing faith through practice (Elena is a catholic and it would have been against her religion for her to kill herself when the indian chief Stone Calf - Woody Strode - took her as his wife) rather than through aloof 'holier than thou' piety shown by the affected hollow sentiments of the settler community. Ford was catholic himself of course and this theme is particularly emphasized in his last film, Seven Women (another under-rated film). The hoe-down also shows Ford's belief that America could never have been created without co-operation between the army and the civilians, Cary and McCabe both supporting each other to forge a better future. This prefigures the alliance between the lawman (Stewart) and the gunfighter (Wayne) in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance who form a partnership to civilize the Wild West. In the present film that civilization is represented by the classic frontier couple, Cary and Marty (Shirley Purcell) who are a standard to which other settler folk must aspire to be acceptable (at least in the world according to John Ford).

The performances across the board here are natural and deeply affectionate. Ford can't help letting his sentimental streak rise to the surface on occasion, but the film's thematic complexity and Charles Lawton's wonderful location photography (shot on sets left over from John Wayne's Alamo shoot) more than compensate. The DVD is good quality with picture and sound very clear. This is probably the cheapest DVD I have ever bought on amazon.com (1.56!!) which makes it an essential purchase for any western-lover. It would be mandatory even at four times the price!",1413244800,2,3676,5.004901960784314

447179,4,6302276594,"I agree with the reviewer who said this film  is batter than The Searchers. The characters are more complex and conflicted and the story is far more subtly moving and ironic. Ford was never very big on irony, so most of his films seem trite to me. I think he didn't like this film because of its dark irony and its criticism of Christian prejudices.

The Searchers was really a rather heavy-handed tale of obsession, prejudice and bigotry, and Wayne's character was totally unsympathetic and maniacal. The ending was inevitable and obvious, like most of Wayne's movies. Even as a kid, I always felt it was a simplistic story trying too hard to be profound.

I haven't seen Two Rode Together for years, yet I remember it we'll as a very thought-provoking movie, bittersweet with humor and tragedy, which is always a heady mix, and perhaps just too complex for a Western. It's not perfect, but I wish the studio would release it on DVD region 1.  It deserves better.",1386460800,,964,4.652941176470589

447247,4,6302276594,"In ""Two Rode Together,"" James Stewart is teamed with Richard Widmark, two of the finest performers of their time, and also includes the great Shirley Jones.  This movie is for some reason extremely difficult to get in America--hence the Portuguese title, but fear not, the English sound track is retained.  I could find no way to turn off the Portuguese subtitles, but was able to ignore them fairly quickly.  It has always been one of my favorite James Stewart westerns, and for years I hae been trying to obtain a copy on DVD.  For a long time, Amazon had a review of it in which someone made the amazing comment ""It's too sad to be a Western.""  I don't know what that means, but evidently, this person had never seen ""Cheyenne Autumn,"" ""Soldier Blue,"" ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" and many other Westerns which are equally sad or sadder.  In this story, a reluctant Stewart is commissioned by the cavalry to go with officer Widmark into Commanche territory to retrieve children who have been taken prisoner over many years by the Native Americans.  It offers fine drama, and many comedic moments, especially from supporting actor Andy Devine.  Stewart and Widmark have great chemistry.  It also presents Native Americans as complex individuals, not as stereotyped as most Westerns of the day.  And there is a strong stance against the stupidity of racial intolerance in the film.  I am proud of Jimmy and Richard, Andy, Shirley, John McIntire and the rest of the cast for making this great film.",1365724800,3,1505,4.794573643410852
447248,4,6302276594,"A sheriff (James Stewart) and an Army Major (Richard Widmark) are sent by the U.S. Army to retrieve the surviving white captives held by a Comanche chief (Henry Brandon) for the past nine years. But it's not an easy task as some of the survivors, perhaps sensing the hostilities of the white community, refuse to return. Directed by John Ford, the specter of his classic THE SEARCHERS hovers over the film. Granted, it had been only five years since THE SEARCHERS had been released but the film had not yet (at least in this country) been acknowledged as one of great American films. If THE SEARCHERS had not existed then perhaps this effort would have fared better but honestly, it's just not as good. Stewart's character is a pale imitation of Wayne's Ethan Edwards but the film does paint a darker picture of white captives being accepted back into the fold. While there's a happy ending for THE SEARCHER's Debbie, the fate of the white boy (David Kent) here is much grimmer. Still, an essential film for the Fordians. Based on the novel COMANCHE CAPTIVES by Will Cook. With Shirley Jones, Linda Cristal (THE ALAMO), John McIntire, Jeanette Nolan, Andy Devine, Paul Birch, Mae Clarke and the usual Ford stock company: Andy Devine, Woody Strode, Anna Lee, Olive Carey, John Qualen, Ken Curtis and Harry Carey Jr.

447282,5,6302276594,"First, I want to point out that Stanley Crouch's review of this movie is outstanding.  Anybody who is serious about understanding the real west should read his review. In my opinion, John Ford did an excellent job of showing the white vs Indian conflict, better than in 'The Searchers'. To most of us, living comfortably more than a century after the west was won, it is difficult to understand the racist attitudes toward the Indians in the 19th century.  Well, how would you feel if you managed to survive being scalped, hide in the bushes, and see your wife raped and murdered, your grandchild burned to death and later consumed by the squaws, and your teenage girls gang raped never to be hear about again. Would you call the ACLU? Invite the 'noble savages' to participate in group therapy? I am sure that there are some lunatic liberals who would do just that. But, the rest of us red blooded Americans its time to look at the real west which was cruel, unforgiven, and ugly. There is no question that John Ford was able to recreate the real west better than anybody else; the agonizing dilema of what to do with whites who lived with barbaric, stone aged, savages and sometimes turned out to be just like them. By the way, many white children who survived Indian captivity and were rescued spent the rest of their lives in lunatic assylems. I wish that Amazon reviews will generate more interest in movies like the present one and make us appreciate the courage of the European immigrants who moved west and carried out Manifest Destiny without which America could not have become the shining example of democracy in human history.",1288137600,6,1638,4.684027777777778
447283,2,6302276594,"""Two Rode Together"" is the 133rd film directed by John Ford, including his silent films (61). It was near the end of his career, and he only made 7 films after this, most of which are forgettable (e.g., ""Seven Women"", ""Young Cassidy"", ""Donovan's Reef"").  Over a 54 year career he won 4 Oscars (""The Quiet Man"", ""How Green was My Valley"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""The Informer"") and was nominated for ""Stagecoach"" (he lost to Victor Fleming for ""GWTW""). He had 3 DGA nominations and 1 win (""The Quiet Man"") and 4 wins by the New York Film Critics.

Interestingly enough he never won a major award for a western, even though he once described himself simply as ""I make westerns"".

By the time ""Two"" came along, Ford had made his major contributions to the western genre. Most people agree his major works were ""Stagecoach"" (1939), the cavalry trilogy (""Fort Apache"" in 1948, ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" in 1949, and ""Rio Grande"" in 1950), and (my personal favorite) ""The Searchers"" (1956). He did several less distinguished westerns including ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), ""Wagon Master"" (1950), ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), and ""Sergeant Rutledge"" (1960).

""Two"" can be distinguished by several factors. First, it doesn't have John Wayne. It's also Ford's first film with James Stewart as well as with Richard Widmark (he'd make more films with both of them in the future). Moreover, it was shot in Bracketville Texas, while many Ford westerns were shot in Utah's Monument Valley (""Stagecoach"", ""Fort Apache"", ""The Searchers"" and 6 more).

Ford did without ""the Duke"", but he did have a few of  his stock company regulars, like Ken Curtis (played Charley McCorry in ""The Searchers""), Harry Carey Jr. who had been with him forever, Olive Carry (Harry's mom, who played Mrs. Jorgensen in ""The Searchers""), John Qualen (played Lars Jorgensen  in ""The Searchers""), Willis Bouchey (the newspaper man in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""), Andy Devine (driver in ""Stagecoach"" and frightened marshall in ""Liberty Valance"") and Woody Strode (""Sergeant Rutledge"" in 1960). But he was missing Ben Johnson, Hank Worden (played ol' Mose in ""The Searchers""), Ward Bond (he died in 1960), and Victor McLaglen (he died in 1959).

Frank Nugent did the screenplay based on a novel by Will Cook called ""Comanche Captives"". Nugent worked with Ford on several films, and together they won the Oscar for ""The Quiet Man"" (1952). Nugent won the WGA award as well, and also won it for ""Mister Roberts"" (1955), and was nominated 2 other times for Ford films  (""She Wore a Yellow  Ribbon"" and ""Fort Apache"").  But Nugent simply takes some Ford staples and rehashes them here. If you like Ford films you've seen almost every scene before. The opening scene with Stewart on the porch is right from Henry Fonda in """"Clementine"". The rivalry between Ken Curtis and Harry Carry Jr. is taken right from ""The Searchers"" between Ken Curtis and Jeffrey Hunter,  the theme of two men looking for Indian hostages is also from ""The Searchers"" as is the performance from  Shirley Jones who is channeling Vera Miles. What is most annoying, if that's the appropriate word, is that Ford re-uses Henry Brandon who did such a great job as Scar in ""The Searchers"" to perform the watered down version in ""Two Rode Together.""

There are some fundamental flaws which make ""Two Rode Together"" a relatively poor film. In most Ford films, the family (and by extension the community) form the core of the protagonist's strength and often the focus of the film. Think - ""How Green Was My Valley"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""The Searchers"", ""The Quiet Man"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"". In this film the family is dysfunctional. Among the cavalry there is dissent, shown in the confrontations between John McIntire and Richard Widmark, but even more so in the dance scene when Widmark attacks his fellow officers. In the homesteaders we have liars (Willis Bouchey), crazy people (Anna Lee), fools (Ken Curtis and Harry Carry Jr.), and a lynch mob (Ford Rainey). Back in Stewart's home town he has a deputy and a girl friend who betray him and a town that votes him out of office. From a family/community POV, this is Ford's most distressing film.

Another element that is missing is the dynamic rivalry between the male leads. Think John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter in ""The Searchers"", John Wayne and William Holden in ""The Horse Soldiers"", John Wayne and Henry Fonda in ""Fort Apache"", John Wayne and Victor McLaglen in ""The Quiet Man"", etc. James Stewart and Richard  Widmark are more like buddies: the tension is minimal.

Also missing is the redemptive actions of the hero. John Wayne in ""The Searchers"" gives up his quest to kill Natalie Wood and returns her to her family; James Stewart confesses to the newspapermen that he isn't the man who shot Liberty Valance. In ""Two"", Jimmy Stewart merely reacts to the decisions of other people - Mr. Wringle cancels the deal for the boy and the town votes him out as sheriff. There is no affirming action on the part of the hero, and his decision to get on the stagecoach is hardly heroic.

Also missing is the comedic relief. Andy Devine was perfectly capable of producing this, but his part is so poorly written that even his great comedic skills can't save it. In past films, Ford often used comedy to great effect - think Victor McLaglen in ""Yellow Ribbon"",  Hank Worden as ol' Mose in ""The Searchers"",  Barry Fitzgerald in ""The Quiet Man"", etc. Ford learned this from the success of the comic sidekicks like Smiley Burnette (Gene Autry), Gabby Hayes (Roy Rogers), and Andy Devine's long playing role as ""Jingles"" in the Guy Madison ""Wild Bill Hickock"" series.

Ford fans will want to see this film for its historic value, and also to see an example of a relatively poor western made by Ford. Most other fans will probably want to give it a miss. Fans of James Stewart as a cowboy  should see ""Liberty Valance"" (1962) or ""Shenandoah (1965). Richard Widmark put in some good performances in westerns like ""The Alamo"" (1960), ""Death of a Gunfighter (1969), and ""The Last Wagon"" (1952).

Ford called the film ""crap"" and claimed he did it for the money ($225,000 + 25% of the net). Take his word for it.",1270080000,6,6189,4.8124410933082

447285,3,6302276594,"TWO RODE TOGETHER(1961)---James Stewart, Richard Widmark, Shirley Jones, John McIntire, Jeanette Nolan, Linda Cristal, Andy Devine, Woody Strode
Directed by John Ford, this film owes more than a little to THE SEARCHERS, although it is not nearly as grim and is certainly not the same calibre of film. It's actually quite full of humor and the interplay between cavalry officer Widmark and town marshall Stewart is the best thing about the movie. A group of homesteaders who were attacked by Comanches 17 years earlier demand that the army attempt to get back several of their number who were carried off by the indians. Against the advice of army major McIntire, who points out that after so much time, their relatives are either dead or thoroughly ""Indianized"", the settlers insist that the army do it anyway. Quite against his will, Widmark's old friend, Stewart, is pressed into service in the attempt because he has had dealings with Comanche Chief Quanah Parker and speaks passable Comanche. Stewart and Widmark both agree with McIntire that going after the kidnapped individuals is futile, but are coerced into going anyway. Widmark and Stewart find the Comanches and are able to secure the release of two ""prisoners""---a Mexican woman(Linda Cristal), who was kidnapped and married to indian warrior Strode, and a ""white"" teen-aged male who does not want to be ""rescued"". The ""core"" of the film centers on the aftermath of the ""rescue"". Along the way, Widmark falls in love with homesteader Shirley Jones and Stewart falls for the Cristal character. This is a worthy addition to Ford's ""western canon""---it is an entertaining, amusing film, with some serious overtones---well-paced and beautifully filmed---worth the time of any fan of westerns.",1257638400,2,1751,5.190812720848056
447286,2,6302276594,"This is arguably Ford's worst picture.  That's not to say it's bad, but compared to other Ford films, it's one of his worst.  Despite some magnificent passages, it's a very tiresome affair.  Ford reportedly did it for the money, hated the script, and just tried to finish it as quickly as possible.  His apathy towards the project comes through.  It feels like a hodgepodge of cliched Western scenes thrown together.

The film does have its pleasures though.  Stewart's performance (his first film with Ford) is very good.  He plays a morally ambiguous sheriff, and Widmark is very good.  There's an excellent scene where Stewart and Widmark are sitting on a river bank just talking.  It runs on for 3 minutes or so (there's no cutting in the scene), and Widmark and Stewart improvised the whole thing.  They didn't even know they were being filmed.  It's the best scene in the film.  Shirley Jones is good here as well, but Andy Devine's ""comic relief"" is quite awful (Devine would redeem himself in Ford's next picture, the masterpiece The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.  It's Devine's finest performance).  If you're a Ford fan, you should check this one out.  If not, stay away.",1221091200,3,1181,4.800995024875622
447287,2,6302276594,"John Ford called ""Two Rode Together"" (1961) ""the worst piece of crap I've done in 20 years."" He was right. The legendary filmmaker shows little enthusiasm for this dreary rehash of ""The Searchers."" James Stewart and Richard Widmark are good additions to the Ford stock company, but they cannot bolster Frank S. Nugent's flat script and the director's fatigue. Happily, Ford rebounded with his final masterpiece, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962).",1210723200,4,454,5.232876712328767

447290,5,6302276594,"This is a lesser version of THE SEARCHERS, which is a masterpiece in just about anybody's canon, but TWO RODE TOGETHER still achieves greatness because every element that plays to the gallery is overcome, or extended, with a surprise. We do not completely know these characters, and they do not completely know themselves, complexities that always make profundity possible in the right hands. It is a simple story that starts out as a comedy and flips over almost suddenly into a drama, and one that becomes increasingly complicated. A marshall kept in fine clothes and money by a madam is recruited by an army officer to go on a mission in which white children taken by the Commanches will be brought back, if found.

 The sheer heat, nuance, and humor of James Stewart and Richard Widmark would make any movie great. They are equally at ease when the film calls for them to be funny or meretricious or moral, hard-nosed or disgusted, out only for themselves and some fun or pulled in by the charms of a virgin or woman who has lived as the wife of a Commanche. That second woman is as essential as the acting of Stewart and Widmark because her experience makes obvious Ford's vision of sexual paranoia. That paranoid contempt results in the defining of  a woman as a pariah even if she has been forced to live with Indians. She must face this hostility when she returns to her Christian origins, which are too often cold and unforgiving of any frailties, such as the normal human response to overwhelming power, which is almost always submission when the choice is to live or be killed. That is why one of white women who has lived with the Commanches for years refuses to go back. She knows the general rejection will be nearly unbearable. This is Ford's disappointment with how Christianity has been interpreted. The greatness of Christianity is found in its compassion and its forgiveness of human limitations. The worst side of it is found in the ideologues so stuffed with pieties they find it easy to reject the unrelenting facts of humanity.

 The film is harsh and simple--no dramatic gunfights or conventional excitement. What excitement Ford chooses to show is the self-righteous glee and rage that attends the lynching of a kidnapped boy who has been with the Commanches for so long that he has become one. Perhaps in his willingness to murder out of ethnic hatred, the boy is expressing as much of his white heritage as he is that of his kidnappers. Ford pushes that blade in and twists it. He knew lynching was also an expression of identity, a ritual in which whiteness declared itself against all real or imagined enemies. It put the world in its proper place. The yokels whom Ford has consistently drawn earlier as buffoon figures or crude stiffs cease to be funny when that very same ignorance and backwardness we have seen made broad fun of  transfers itself into the simple-minded form of rough justice that plants the ""strange fruit"" of a body hanging from a tree.

 The boy who is lynched is perhaps as savage as his killers but more savage than the whites imagine ALL the Indians to be. Some of the Commanches are shrewd and know that their historical time has passed and that they must get whatever they can from the white man while the getting is good, since he will change the rules whenever he concludes that changing them will work to his advantage. Those shrewd Commanches are bitterly resigned. They feel the cold metal of modern life closing in on them while others chant into the night, assuming their gods will deflect the bullets of the white man when the inevitable conflicts arrive next. That makes such Commanches simultaneously tragic and dangerous. Their gods have been outdone and they do not know it. Or do not want to know it. Their fate, like that of Stone Calf, is to die in battle believing they are protected by their prayers and their singing. For this reason, there is no drama when Stone Calf steps forward and is easily killed by James Stewart's marshall. His naive beliefs have made him less a great warrior than a pathetic man who has duped himself into such vulnerability that he does not even put up a good fight. He is the only one surprised by what happens when the bullets come his way.

 One particularly powerful moment shows how easily one can become something that one did not start out as takes place when the Mexican woman who has been the wife of the warlike Indian Stone Calf automaticallys lifts fistfuls of dirt and chants a death song after he has been slain. When stopped and pulled away, she remembers how much she hated Stone Calf and spits on his corpse. A variaton on this happens when the boy who is about to be lynched cries out when a music box he loved to listen to before he was kidnapped is knocked over and he suddenly, for a moment, remembers who was once upon a time. There again is the Fordian sense of tragedy: the boy has been claimed by a woman settler who convinces herself that he is her lost child. Her fantasy leads to her death once she unties the boy. She dies because of something she wants to believe and he dies because he does not accept his blood heritage, which he has forgotten.

 The boy screams as loudly when he is about to be hanged as he did when protesting that he was not white but a Commanche as his captors traded him back to the white men for some repeating rifles. That is one layer of tragedy; the deepest is that, hearing that tune come from the music box, he has the Proustian moment and his entire childhood with his family reappears in his mind, a few minutes before he will join all of the dead, a symbol of murder left to defile a tree and rot. So our fantasies and our memories make and unmake us. Only our compassion humanizes us. There it is.

  This is an important film about American identity, true or imposed, nurtured in one situation, transformed in another. No one other John Ford--or since Ford!--has presented or pursued such complex ethnic issues, all the while rising above the predictable narrows of propaganda. The rich and forboding aspects of our miscegenated American lives and our collective history--in style or religion or blood--have remained beyond most of our filmmakers and almost all of our writers of fiction. You have got to watch that John Ford: he'll upset you.  Even when he makes a film that is not a total classic, the mind and the passions of a genius are expressing themselves, and some of that combination rubs off on the work at hand, forever gleaming like big, big nuggets in the wet pan of the prospector.",1095552000,47,6563,4.601368691189051

7823430,1,6302276594,"""the worst piece of crap I've made in 20 years"", that's what the Director of the film himself, John Ford called this picture, and I'd have to agree. I love Stewart & Widmark but they don't have any real ""chemistry"" here like I hoped (not like Stewart & Fonda did which was fantastic). The subject matter of the film is serious, bringing back family members kidnapped/captured by the Comanches to their loved ones, but the ""tone"" in this film keeps changing from ""buddy picture comedy"", to serious western drama. As IMDB states, ""both Actors were considered 10-15 years too for the parts they were playing"" and I'd  have to agree is just one problem among many with the film. When Stewart & Widmark finally get to their destination and begin trading guns for captives the film still has about 1/3 left and that's where the changing 'tones' become almost unwatchable. I bought this film to see Stewart & Widmark  on screen together when the best thing to see in it is Woody Strode as the most ""buffed"" Man in America playing one of the Comanche warriors. His part is brief & ridiculous but you look at him a realize why he was a Cowboy in real life (he was a rodeo rider), and one of the first Black players in the NFL--the man is a specimen!",1489449600,,1240,4.482300884955753
