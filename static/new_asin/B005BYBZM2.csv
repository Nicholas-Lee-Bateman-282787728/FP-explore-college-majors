4649514,5,B005BYBZM2,"Excellent Film.  Atrocious is another entry into the handy cam style movie. I found it to be really good. The movies run time is about 70 min and I think it works well. This story tells about a family that goes vacationing to an old house they own up in the woods. Half the movie introduces the characters and shows us the real freaky locale of the movie: The woods maze. Most of the beginning shows us the maze during the day time. The last half hour grabs us and doesn't let us go. Taking us through a crazy chase through the maze with nothing but out imagination going wild as to what this ""thing"" is. The ending is awesome. Believable, scary and freakishly filmed. The movie spends most of it's night scenes using the night vision mode on the camera. The ending was really good and unexpected.",1314144000,16,797,4.385135135135135

4649557,1,B005BYBZM2,"No one would do the stupid things these people did in this movie.  They happened to have video cameras at all times, but apparently telephones were not invented yet.  If you like screaming at people because, wow, there's a killer in the house and all my family is missing and blood stains are everywhere, I think I'll go look in the creepy basement - then watch this movie.  It is loaded with stuff like that - they didn't even pretend to respond in a normal way to the stuff that was happening.  I got sucked in and watched the whole movie, cause you were hoping to eventually see something, but I could not get over the dumbness of the characters through the entire thing.",1403481600,,674,4.411290322580645
4649558,2,B005BYBZM2,"The found footage genre can be quite the mixed bag. For every ""Rec"" we seem to get two films that end up as bad as ""The Devil Inside"". Sadly ""Atrocious"" is closer to the latter.

Two siblings (Cristian and July) like to investigate urban legends and tape them in the process. When the family takes a trip to creepy old house with a creepy past (and an even creepier labyrinth outside), the two start their investigation that they'll wish they never started.
Doesn't sound too bad right? Well, sadly the premise is about as good as it gets here. What could've been a very suspenseful and even claustrophobic addition to the found footage genre, just ends up a slightly tedious one instead. It's only 73 minutes, but it still manages to be a bit slow, and it takes a while to get going. Found footage films rely on their suspenseful buildups that lead to their spooky endings, but I truly didn't find the film to be all that suspenseful. I mean the Labryrinth was a great idea, and eerie in itself, but even that never fully lived up to it's potential. I actually thought the setting was more effective during the day scenes oddly enough. Once nightfalls, the setting is used for alot of panic, alot of heavy breathing, and alot of camera shaking. It's too bad.
The film finally reaches it's conclusion, and it's mildly creepy I suppose, but not enough to make up for the faults that led up to it. As for the acting? Not too bad. The characters are supposed to seem ""real"", and for the most part they do. Sure they make unrealistic decisions (you'll wonder often why they're still holding on to their cameras) , but their acting isn't too bad.

Overrall ""Atrocious"" isn't the worst of it's kind, and it may mildly interest people who love the found footage genre. However if you're don't, then this won't be the film to make you a fan either.",1382227200,,1840,4.5225225225225225
4649559,3,B005BYBZM2,"This movie was mostly the children getting lost in a ""Maze"" outside this family ""getaway"" home.
Something sinister there...you don't really find out what it is until the very end.
This movie could have been MUCH BETTER than it came...the director needs to go watch it him/herself.",1371859200,,280,4.9787234042553195
4649560,1,B005BYBZM2,"We have another entry into the found footage horror genre, from the files of the Spanish police department comes this one where a family goes to a house in El Garraf surrounded by woods. There's a story about a young girl who got lost in an old labyrinth near said house. After hearing from a friend that there are varying versions of this old legend, they decide to film everything. They being Cristian and his sister July, they film using two handheld cameras to capture any sort of hauntings and images in this old house and it's surroundings.

Well of course at first things seem fine, Cristian and July even explore this labyrinth during the day soon after arriving at the house. Of course like fools they get lost for a bit, then soon after things get weird, their dad doesn't want them in that place and to only film inside the house. Things get evern stranger when figures start appearing around at night, violence of course occurs but none of this ever warrants either Cristian or July putting down their camera or gasp turn it off and run for safety.

The problems with ""Atrocious"" are plentiful, namely how for a good long while the kids just wander around, checking out the woods, the house especially the basement that has a lot of their old stuff from when they were younger. The shaky camera style of filming really puts off the viewer after a while, in fact it makes the movie feel very amateurish very quickly.

The idea behind the movie isn't a bad one, if not fairly typical but even at 75 minutes this movie drags on for the first half. The Spanish setting and dialogue try to lend a different feel to this material but it doesn't work, at least for too long. Like most 'found footage' horror films and most horror films in general, ""Atrocious"" relies on the characters making very stupid decisions when they should maybe just leave during the day.

Too many times during the night shots and during the scary moments I was saying out loud, ""Okay, yes? What are we supposed to be looking at?"". Given all the fault of the movie, ""Atrocious"" certainly is an accurate title for the material we're watching. * out of 4 stars.",1369440000,,2140,4.55064935064935
4649561,3,B005BYBZM2,Slow beginning. Plot begins to unravel well into the movie. If you like twisted plots you will like this film.,1368230400,,110,4.55
4649562,4,B005BYBZM2,"First of all, I want to ask everyone who writes a review for anything to be honest. I'm sick of renting stuff that has super high user reviews and turns out to be crap. Don't waste my $ & time so your friend gets exposure and dough. And yes, I'm keeping in mind that everyone's opinion is subjective, however, there have been too many situations where I, with an open mind, still had no idea how all ten reviews were 5 star, gushing praise, and the work was a trite piece of been there, done that.

Anyway, I watch a lot of horror films & have done so for some time. I can safely say I've seen a bit to a bunch of everything horror. So in rating this film with four stars, you gotta know that's me giving it a pseudo-educated, high acclaim. Don't let the found footage thing scare you off. Yep, it's been done over and over, but I've come to the conclusion that it's not a trend, just on the verge of becoming pass, but rather a new and permanent addition to the stock pantry of the many elements that can be used in filmmaking. It is appreciated when done well, and seems plagiarized when it's not.

Besides the found footage thing, I think the other creepy elements include the fact that it's not in my native tongue (I'm a true believer that foreign horror is the best horror...I think the foreign nature alone - the way it separates itself by being the ""other"" through both the unfamiliar language and also the unique cultural establishments - make these types of films very outside of what is normal to me, and thus exciting fear...isn't fear housed in the unknown?) and because it's in black and white (also another flavor of the unknown...the restriction of color can separate us more, giving the film something else that makes it not as translatable).

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that this one has just the right ingredients to make it a successfully scary recipe. Highly recommended as something to watch as you work out. Cardio+adrenaline-raising distraction = crazy calorie burn! :)",1361664000,5,2000,4.519337016574585
4649563,2,B005BYBZM2,"Atrocious (Fernando Barreda Luna, 2010)

Completely generic shakycam feature about a family who heads off to inhabit the ancestral pile, which is surrounded by woods in which a legendary ghost supposedly will guide lost travelers out. When they get there, they find out that maybe the ghost isn't quite so helpful as the legend would have it... in other words, this is a movie you have seen any number of times before, and you probably liked it a lot better the last dozen times you saw it. * ",1360368000,,493,4.590909090909091
4649564,3,B005BYBZM2,"As in all 'hand held footage', the movie does take awhile for it to get interesting but when it does, it works. I did enjoy the twist ending it has. Not one of my favorites but overall, it's alright.",1355097600,,199,4.128205128205129
4649565,2,B005BYBZM2,"Shot in the ""The Blair Witch Project""-like first-person POV style, ""Atrocious"" centers on the Quintanilla family of five, whose horrifying experiences at their summer house in Sitges are recorded in handheld video cameras. There is one good idea in ""Atrocious,"" but it is not enough to save this Spanish low-budget film from being another forgettable entry in the overcrowded horror subgenre of found-footage thriller.

Christian and July, a brother and sister making a web show about urban legends, investigate a local legend of a ghost girl named Melinda, while staying at the family's country house. What follows is a series of familiar horror devices including a barking dog and a disused well, except the final fifteen minutes.

The 75-minute film has several creepy moments, to be sure, but they are few and far between. Writer and director Fernando Barreda Luna knows how to enhance suspense, but achieved only limited success, as the film spends too much time trying to set up the atmosphere. The film's first half includes scenes of the protagonist wandering in the deserted hedge labyrinth and woods, which are disorienting at first, but then gets boring.

Filmmakers of ""Atrocious"" seem to rely too much on the idea I mentioned above, a genre-bending attempt that might have worked as a short film. I will not disclose what it is here. I only add that being stretched beyond its limit, this idea does not have enough substance to stand as a feature film, which ""Atrocious"" strives to be.",1346889600,2,1498,5.008032128514056
4649566,4,B005BYBZM2,"To start with, the first half of this film is very slow.  You will wonder what is happening, and what is the point of all of this.  In fact, it is truly like watching someone's home videos from 1995 -- very amateur, very boring.

Yet, this is what makes this film succeed in the end.  These are truly human characters without any of the Hollywood tricks.  They are real; either you sympathize with them, or you don't.  End of story.  If you don't, you give this movie a one-star review and go on about your business.  But if you do, the suspense will grow on you gradually, creep up on you from behind, until you find yourself checking the windows and doors to make sure they are locked.

When it comes to this kind of movie, I am no easy customer.  Only Carpenter's _Halloween_ and Kubrick's _The_Shining_ have affected me.  _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ (the iconic found-footage film) scared me the first time, but by the second viewing, I was hoping for the annoyingly contrived characters to be killed.  Even after several viewings, _Atrocious_ has retained its intended effect.  It is a well-crafted thriller that may seem tame by today's standards, but which creates an authentic atmosphere of horror and suspense unparalleled by few movies released in the past few years.

Is it perfect?  No.  Even though it achieves its intended effect, it really needs something to draw the attention of its audience much earlier in the film.  I suspect most negative reviews are written by reviewers who only saw the first half.  Do yourself a favor and watch the entire film, then let's hear what you think.  You just might be pleasantly (unpleasantly?) surprised!",1339977600,4,1656,4.808510638297872
4649567,1,B005BYBZM2,"Shot in a 'Blair Witch' way, this movie was one of the worst I've seen in a while. Not because of how it was shot, but due to the content.....2/3 of this movie felt like I was watching someone's boring home videos. A lot of it was just obvious filler....minute after minute of absolutley unnecessary nothing that simply killed time and didn't move the story along or was drawn out too long. There's literally 10 minutes straight of just someone running around in the dark, all you see is the camera's view with the light hitting the trees randomly and you hear someone panting. It's a looong stretch of film that's just this and this alone. This movie has a cool twist at the end, but not cool enough to make it worth the watch. This is one of those movies you start watching, realize it's boring, hang in there hoping it gets better, but it doesn't, and you struggle with yourself. Should I see it through or turn it off? Don't even bother wasting your time to get to that point! I want my 1.25 hours back! Not scary, boring, full of useless stuff to kill time to turn this into a 'movie'. SKIP IT.",1325808000,10,1099,4.339805825242719
4649568,1,B005BYBZM2,I'll be brief.  The first two thirds of the film is just a lot of tramping through the underbrush with a camera; the end is tacked on with no connection to the set-up.  A total stinker.  Don't waste your time.  It's an hour and a half I'll never get back.,1322956800,,255,4.04
4649569,2,B005BYBZM2,"I'll make this short - I rented this because I love ""found footage"" horror movies. This one operates on that premise, and the trailer looked pretty good. The first half of the movie delivers a promising setup - the last half is a complete and utter disappointment. By the end, I guarantee you'll be asking yourself, ""is that all there is?!?"" It's like the filmmaking team simply quit at the halfway point and just figured they could throw in any predictable, boring ending. And that's what they did. I suggest to my friends that they not waste their money on this film, despite the packaging and the trailer.

SPOILER ALERT: Al least half the movie is spent wandering aimlessly and (with one very, very brief exception) through a disused outdoor plant ""labyrinth"" utterly without any kind of surprise or ""horror"" or, really, anything interesting.

4649571,5,B005BYBZM2,"Wow, I was sucked into this thing right to the end.  I kind of knew who would be the culprit at the end of it all, but it was done so well that I didn't even care.  I think I was holding my breath for about 10 full minutes there near the end.  It was a funhouse ride and I enjoyed it immensely.  Not bad for a handheld camera film.  Don't make too many comparisons to other movies of this same genre, just enjoy for what it is.  Cool flick, I recommend it.",1320451200,8,456,3.849462365591398
4649572,4,B005BYBZM2,"I must admit that ""Atrocious"" willingly suspended my disbelief and even in its final moments, it had me by the critical arteries and it wouldn't release me from its deep-fang jugular grip.  Yet this isn't to say that I knew what the Heck's Succulent Neck was going on in this Spanish horror ""mess""-terpiece ... not at all, not in the least!  I was ruinously LOST, worse than Johnny Depp's compass in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" money orchard.  *D*E*S*P*I*T*E* my ""suspension of disbelief.""  From ""stem to stern.""  I was adrift in a nightmare without narrative, plot, ""rhyme nor reason.""  Only a SUPER-SMARTER-MASTER-BEYOND-THIS-GLOBAL-MIND, INFINITELY sharper than my own, IMHO, could decryptify a 10,000 piece puzzle with about 4,000 pieces missing.  Now that's the definition of ""atrocious,"" indeed.

WHAT the he%# were the writers and directors trying to ""make happen"" here, other than cerebral aneurysms!?!  I've NEVER seen a film MORE in need of a GLOSS, in my ENTIRE LIFE before the silver(-bullet) screen.  I just wish that I KNEW, so I wouldn't have to stay up all night trying to make sense out of the insensible!  Oooo-ahhh-argh-ugh!  I'm not sure what's the GREATER nightmare.  The horror taking place in ""Atrocious,"" story-wise I mean; or the AMAZING LACK of any kind of ""wow!"" this film endeavors to instill within the mental acumen of global masters of horror world wide.  Oh Lords of Horror!  What ""FUN GUYS"" *D*I*D* those Spaniards consort with; clearly they were ""of some OTHER world, no?""  Oh dear.  Oh dear, d-d-dear d-dear dear d-dear ...
