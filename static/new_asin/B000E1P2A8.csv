The accompanying music is good, and the narration that's been added to Tillie's Punctured Romance made it easier to follow as well as more fun to watch.  I would recommend this DVD to any Chaplin aficionado.",1279065600,22,352,4.85

8104168,5,B000E1P2A8,This is a collection for Chaplin fans and those who've never seen him before. The features showcase his inimitable grasp of comedic timing with films that range from typical pathos to gentle romance. Recommended for fans and the uninitiated.,1372723200,2,241,5.205128205128205
8104169,4,B000E1P2A8,"I bought this to use in my high school theater class. The kids were not the least bit interested in a silent film and had no concept of who Charlie Chaplin was. It does have good examples of slapstick comedy, which the kids did like, but since it isn't in color, has no violent action and no sound, they lost interest in about 2 minutes. Personally, I liked it, but then I'm OLD! The video is a bit grainy, but that doesn't seem to interfere with watching the movies.",1372464000,2,467,4.258426966292135
8104170,5,B000E1P2A8,"Charlie invented a lot. Here is typical Charlie Chaplin. Interesting to see the creative mind in process. Not always so humerous to me today, but still interesting to see the development of ideas in early film.",1363564800,,210,4.861111111111111
8104171,4,B000E1P2A8,"Most of the movies were very poor quality, but heck, for such old movies to begin with, and only paying around 50 cents a movie, you can't complain too much.",1352073600,,157,4.266666666666667
8104172,3,B000E1P2A8,Chaplin features were enjoyable to watch but not the best quality. But for the cost this was a great deal.,1288569600,11,106,4.35
