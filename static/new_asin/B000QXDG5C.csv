8198033,5,B000QXDG5C,The two episodes in this dvd were what I was looking for - the history of Beirut and along with it all the different culinary delights of the middle east.  Too bad they are trapped in a civil war.,1386028800,,196,4.0256410256410255
8198034,5,B000QXDG5C,"This production shows urban, suburban, rural, and nomadic Lebanese cultures through its food. Specatacular cuisine is highlighted in Beirut, Tripoli, port cities, mountain villages, and with a nomadic family. Insights into the history of the civilizations and highlights of the historic culture are bonuses. The British host is very excited about all the people and foods she is able to encounter in these moments of peace in this troubled land. Gorgeous scenery and even more gorgeous food will leave you hungry for the food, make you wish you could travel to this amazing land, and sad that it is often so dangerous to do so (this was filmed very shortly before major fighting resumed).",1292716800,,688,5.043859649122807
8198035,2,B000QXDG5C,I was really disappointed with this DVD. It didn't give me the best look into Beirut. It didn't show very much of downtown and it went into things that weren't even a big part of the Lebanese culture like the whole part on the break dancing kids in the street. My boyfriend is from there and he's never even seen these guys. It just seemed to waste time that they could be spending documenting more interesting things. I will say that the special part all about Lebanese cuisine was at least some what fun to watch.,1268524800,4,515,4.375
