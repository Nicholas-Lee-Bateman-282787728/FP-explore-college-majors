Description: Abusive relationships are an ever-growing problem in adolescent love relationships. Jealousy, possissiveness, controlling behaviors, abusive language, degrading words, and outright violence are the indicators. Strangely, the victim often feels that what is happening must be ""normal"" - or if not, that he or she is somehow at fault. A victim begins to become isolated, afraid, and less and less likely to understand the extent of the abuse as it happens.

This tape presents interviews with abused individuals, abuse counselors, and an abuser. Each discusses his or her own experiences, the brutal cycle of emotional and physical abuse, and warning signs of an abusive relationship, and how to get help and legal assistance if you are in one",1105315200,2,827,5.4296875
