Henry Murphy is great! Great for learning how to play Banjo",1375920000,,113,3.75
3010348,5,B000Y01XF2,"I am starting to understand the music more, real informative, and even I can understand it, I wish I had bought it sooner",1357430400,2,121,4.304347826086956
3010349,4,B000Y01XF2,Best way to learn to play the banjo. This one was cheaper so I bought it first. So good I asked for Volume #1 for Christmas.,1356566400,2,124,3.8076923076923075
3010350,1,B000Y01XF2,"I bought Beginning Banjo 2 along with Beginning Banjo 1 which was a waist of my money the instruction was not very plain and there is no way I would ever play the Banjo by ear with these instructions on lessons #1. On Beginning Banjo 2 I did not even open it cause it would be a waiste of my time , I wish I could send them back for a refund , but the postage would be to expensive for me. Buyer be aware...Don...",1352419200,,413,3.8705882352941177
3010351,5,B000Y01XF2,"Murphy Henry goes through each song piece by piece.  You can go at your own pace with the DVD really getting down a part before moving on to the next until suddenly you know the whole song.  She says not to write anything down, which worked until I got to a complicated song but didn't need to tab it, just make notes as to the sequence of rolls.  She shows how to do some basic stuff, also, like pull offs and hammers, etc.  Excellent product.",1306368000,4,444,4.188235294117647
3010352,5,B000Y01XF2,My banjo teacher wanted me to learn via several methods.  So he asked me to try the Murphy Method.  The bottom line is:  It works.  She presents the skills in an easy to understand way.  I would buy again.,1265760000,4,205,4.153846153846154

8230420,2,B000Y01XF2,"It really could be me, but this style of learning isn't for everyone.. a visual person is in heaven.. but someone who needs to use tab or sheet music will be lost.  I've been playing for about a year.. and was completely lost! She is fantastic though!",1475107200,2,251,4.340425531914893
8230421,5,B000Y01XF2,great she is an excellent instructor makes you want to learn more & more,1433635200,,72,4.214285714285714
8230422,5,B000Y01XF2,Perfect to get you in the right direction.,1426032000,,42,4.375
8230423,5,B000Y01XF2,Murphy's the best to get you started playing and her lessons are still great once you have mastered some of the basics too.,1425340800,,123,4.391304347826087
8230424,5,B000Y01XF2,this arrived 1 day before the posted date in great shape I am very pleased and so will my husband be on Christmas day,1418083200,,117,3.9166666666666665
8230425,5,B000Y01XF2,I use this with my other dvd's. Very good purchase. When you miss something just back it up and replay. She also plays if for you fast and slow so you get  the full effect.,1417132800,2,172,3.914285714285714
8230426,5,B000Y01XF2,I found this DVD to be an excellent way to learn. She treats the learner as if they just started playing and if you do what she says and practice the riffs start coming and then the songs start coming. I would highly recommend to anyone.,1400112000,,237,4.173913043478261
8230427,3,B000Y01XF2,It is okay.  I hate the way it is recorded in bits and pieces and you have to continually wait to load the next lesson.,1398038400,,119,3.76
8230428,5,B000Y01XF2,Been playing chords for a few years on my own and knew I needed to step up to the next level.  This is a great way to learn and I am excited about learning licks and look forward to the day when it all clicks and I can just fall into a pattern when playing with others.  I have been able to catch on quickly due to the breakdown way of teaching.  Murphy has the gift of teaching.,1384473600,3,379,3.8333333333333335
