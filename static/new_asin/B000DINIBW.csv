8102402,5,B000DINIBW,This is a good story about clever art forgery and idea to steal the original. Swift action is taking place in the beautiful medieval town of Cracow therefore the scenery is nice to look at. Moreover this movie is a comedy and director is  a man experienced in this kind of movie genre and what is most important has English subtitles. Recommended,1403395200,,346,4.580645161290323
8102403,4,B000DINIBW,"Crime drama with a not completely original plot but still interesting because of the setting!! No spoilers but the ending has a twist that makes you think!! And it is about a Da Vinci painting that actually exists in Krakow, I have seen it many times. But to call the girl beautiful, as some have, is a gross exageration. You will meet many Polish girls much better looking on the street in less than a half hour in the main Market Square. She is only an ordinary actress, no special talent.

And before any radfems object to my use of girl, that is what they call themselves. Get used to the fact that girls see radfems as ""nuts"" in Eastern Europe!! One Krakow girl asked me just that? She said she wanted flowers and she Loved to wear pretty dresses, so I should get used to both.

An enjoyable crime caper with no killing or gore!! More outsmarting each other in unpredictable ways!! Enjoy, then visit the city.",1350518400,,914,4.434523809523809
8102404,4,B000DINIBW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, although my limited understanding of Polish was put to the test and the English subtitles were quite helpful.  The plot was relatively subdued by American standards, but it was quite humorous at times and there were plenty of plot twists to keep me enthralled.  Having visited Krakow twice in real life, I appreciated the views of the city that the movie offered.  Look for the Krakow bugle call!

To summarize briefly: On medical parole from prison, incorrigible thief Cuma (Robert Wieckiewicz) reunites with his old friend Julian (Borys Szyc), a former criminal associate who's become a police officer in the interim.  Cuma has been hired to take part in the biggest heist of his criminal career: stealing Leonardo da Vinci's painting ""Lady with Ermine,""known simply as Vinci in certain circles, from the Czartoryskich Museum in Krakow. But can Julian persuade his former partner to relent from stealing the national treasure and handing it over to the broker who arranged for his early release?  With the dishonest broker and a crack police squad keeping multiple eyes on him, Cuma elects to try the heist anyway, while Julian struggles to decide whether to help him or stop him.

Gaining access to the painting is simple in comparison to actually getting away with it, but Cuma's techniques are quite unorthodox and unexpected...  :-)",1220054400,3,1371,5.062222222222222
8102405,4,B000DINIBW,With suspense and funny. Vinci refers to Leonardo Da Vinci and the movie is about Da Vinci's only painting in Poland that robbers are attempting to steal. Quite different from the Hollywood action movie and a nice illustration that Poles value wit above brute power. Only minus is that plot is a little hard to follow; you need to be quite attentive at the end to understand what the unfolding of the plot actually was.,1194912000,3,419,4.6
