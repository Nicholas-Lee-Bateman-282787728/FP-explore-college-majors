4657764,4,B005DCDA7K,This DVD was an interesting view  of a game I am interested in and have read the book. It was shot in Bandon Oregon,1353801600,,115,3.7916666666666665
4657765,4,B005DCDA7K,"Netflix finally had  the film...  I was expecting to be let down , but was pleasantly surprised. I imagine that it is too metaphysical for the average viewer since it only averaged a two star rating for Netflix viewers . It moved at a good pace going back and forth between the round of golf  with Shivas  , the dinner party that came later , and then the search for Seamus Mcduff in his home in the ravine.  There was the obligatory scene from the book where Shivas borrows Seamus' baffing spoon at night and then proceeds to score a hole in one with an old feathery.  the course that they played was Bandon Dunes in Oregon which is a true links course. Oddly enough, George Stephanopolus  was one of the producers. It had my favorite line from the book: You are trying to hard , and you are thinking too much.",1341964800,2,811,4.296052631578948

David O'Hara is a wonderful Chivas Irons..For the naysayers, go watch The Avengers or Battleship.. not everything needs to be non-stop action...and you could probably benefit from a little ""true gravity"". After all, its a solemn and serious matter.",1337817600,3,357,5.0508474576271185
4657767,3,B005DCDA7K,"""Michael you have to remember your in the land where all these rules
were invented. It's the only way you can play in the kingdom."" Michael
Murphy (Gamble) is a philosophy student that is searching for himself.
His one real love is golf and before he decided to give it up forever
he stops by Scotland to play in the famous ""Links of Burningbush."" I
have said this before but I am a sucker for sports movies. Any kind and
golf is no different. I really enjoyed ""Greatest Game Ever Played"" &
""Bobby Jones"". The recent ""Seven Days In Utopia"" was also fantastic so
my expectations were high for this one. While the movie itself is not
bad and the scenery is pretty I was very disappointed. This movie is
more of watching the young boy Michael meeting a golf pro named Shivas
Irons (O'Hara) who proceeds to teach him about the game. The movie then
becomes watching Michael get an hour private lesson about golf. I
understand the book is great, but I wasn't that entertained by this
movie. It's not bad, I was just hoping for something different.
Overall, not bad, but more of movie about the rules and philosophy of
golf then the sport itself. I give it a B-.",1336867200,4,1155,4.427230046948357
4657768,3,B005DCDA7K,"First off, you need to know that I don't play golf and I find watching the sport quite boring, so I didn't approach this film, adapted from Michael Murphy's novel, from that angle. But, like watching the game, this 87-minute film moved VERY slow for me.

The story - about Murphy's stop in Scotland on the way to India - and learning the ""tao of golf"" from the pro Shivas Irons - is not told in a linear format. As we hear in the bonus interviews, it is about the ""feeling of playing golf"". So I'm sure that golfers will get a lot more from this than non-golfers. And the scenery is gorgeous. (The film was made in the US using FOUR different courses to recreate the one in Burningbush, Scotland.

The bonus features are also a bit of a mix: The ""Behind the scenes"" one (14 minutes) consists of a 9-minute ""montage"" (basically scenes from filming with no narration) and four short interviews with the cast. The other is an 18-minute interview with Murphy.

I'm sure some golfers will add their reviews here, but I wanted to provide the opinion of a non-golfer. And for me the film and DVD was ""just okay"".

I hope you found this information both informative and helpful.

4657789,2,B005DCDA7K,"If you treasure the book, as I do, you'll want to see the movie, but go in with low expectations. Frankly, don't even bother. They missed the point and, for me, the casting is all wrong. Michael comes off as childish and petulant, instead of emotional and thoughtful. Shivas is portrayed as a swaggering, twisted lout, not the larger than life, deeply intellectual Zen-master
of the links that is portrayed in the book. Too much Charles Bronson, not enough Yoda. I wanted to love it, but couldn't. Sorry. Two stars only because most of the golf swings at least looked like real golf swings.",1379289600,3,590,4.6826923076923075

4657796,4,B005DCDA7K,"Well, where to start with? Having read the book by M.Murphy long time ago, been in Scotland for many times... It seemed to me almost impossible to bring the book onto a screen, but, the spirit of the book and of the game is sensible, the pictures awesome, even not screened in Scotland (you will know when you've been there). Why not 5 Stars? Too much has been left out of the content, which is important to my understanding. Too many scenes, which seem to be neglectable, because merely used for atmosphere. But at the end I am happy to have a piece of the Inner Game of Golf, as it could be, the mystical part of it. And I belief there is something like that despite the huge money game, which Golf has become nowadays.
So, can't effort to travel to the Kingdom? Sit back, relax, have a good dram and enjoy.... Maybe you are keen to go out for a round afterwords - during moonlight.",1360108800,3,884,4.299401197604791

4657798,5,B005DCDA7K,". . . You ought to LOVE the movie.

This entirely anti-genre flick matches precisely in tone and aesthetic what Michael Murphy was seeking to convey about the Game of Golf. I know. I asked him.

Without explaining/showing what True Gravity means, the movie is just another random movie on the origins of golf - at a very modest level.
