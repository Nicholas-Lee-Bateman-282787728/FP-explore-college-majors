8399956,5,B002ILRCHI,"3 of the Best Christmas Movies of all time in my eyes!!! Comes in an awesome box as shown in the picture!

The movies themselves are beautiful when put on blu-ray!! The metallic red on Turbo Man's outfit is extremely sharp while the smile on Santa's face in MIRACLE on 34th is dazzling! Even the piercing screams of the Wet Bandits getting beat up are crisp and clear with the near perfect audio in Home Alone!

Highly Highly Recommended!!!!",1259798400,5,441,4.569620253164557
