8375997,5,B002OF4ZDC,It's funny. It has beautiful footage. It's engaging - and has something to say without being heavy-handed. I give it often as a gift. Great movie!,1425427200,,146,4.653846153846154
8375998,5,B002OF4ZDC,"This is seriously funny video. The premise of an American Muslim taking flying lesson after 9/11 is brilliant. The observations in the broader context of what it means to be a very typical suburban American family while also keeping faith with Islam is thought-provoking. I keep sharing this with friends and family, especially those in the US.

Moneem Salam's documentary is a powerful antidote for vicious mis-characterisations of Muslims in the US.

Moneem and his wife, Iman, were courageous in opening their lives and home to public view.  I certainly found the result to be powerful with a well-judged mix of humour and serious observations. I laughed and I cried a bit too. I have been away from the US for most of my adult life and sometimes despair of the direction our home country is going but when I see the resilience and good nature of Americans in addressing stigmatisation, I feel hope that reason and fairness will prevail, with work and perseverance.

Thanks to Moneem and his family for opening eyes and hearts by sharing their lives.",1358899200,,1053,4.865921787709497
8375999,5,B002OF4ZDC,"I keep buying this video to give as a gift. Here's why:
There's adventure - learning to fly
there's humor - Monem's first solo flight is hilarious
there's beauty - the shots of flying over Mt. Baker are spectacular
there's some family drama - negotiating the cost of learning to fly
and then - there's some social commentary on what it means to be a Muslim in the United States.

This kind of movie fits the bill for a lot of people on my gift list.",1324425600,,449,4.22093023255814
