8680273,5,B00NU84T3I,My grandchildren love these DVDs.  I had to return them because one of the DVDs froze.  There wasn't a problem with returning them.  I was disappointed the price went up when untried to repurchase them.  Gave a 5 because the product is a great learning set!!,1506297600,,258,4.543478260869565
