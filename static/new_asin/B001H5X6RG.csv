8307900,3,B001H5X6RG,"I kind of knew going in that I wouldn't care much for this film, but I was curious, since the kid from ""Lifted"" was in it, and he
is a fine child actor.  What little heart the film had was in the scenes with him and his family.  As I am in my 70,s I am not the
demographic this film is made for.  The action was well done, and while this kind of story is not at all original, it was done
better than I expected.  For those testosterone driven young males that love to see lots of fighting and bloodletting, you
won't be disappoiinted.  Plus there are some good nude scenes.of voluptuous women.  If I were about 50 years younger,
I probably would have rated the film a bit higher.",1369008000,,679,4.106060606060606
8307901,5,B001H5X6RG,"I brought this movie because I like Johnny Messner, the actor and wanted to see more of his movies. The plot did have twists and turns, held interest and was exciting",1362182400,,166,4.387096774193548
8307902,5,B001H5X6RG,"Being a girl I'm probably not the target-audience for this film, but I was curious and thought I'd try it anyway. The fighting scenes are pretty brutal, but look very realistic and let's face it: real fighting is bloody and painful. The plot is believable and the acting is allround good. Stacy Keach looks like an aging Garfield on a bad day and I can't imagine anyone else could have done it better. Johnny Messner has charism and screen presence and can easily embody both hero and thug, which makes characters always more believable in my book. And yes: he's very goodlooking. Being a phtoographer I also loved the lighting in this movie. Especially during the fight-scenes.
Despite my initial expectations this movie had me engrossed and nailed to my seat. I'll happily recommend this to all my friends.",1252972800,5,808,4.820143884892087
8307903,3,B001H5X6RG,"""Ring of Death""  finds Burke Wyatt (Johnny Messner) unemployed, separated from his wife (Charlotte Ross), and acting as a part-time father.  Approached by his old partner, who is now with the FBI, ex-cop Burke is offered an undercover job that has a huge payoff.  Burke can't afford to turn the job down.  Because of a violent background in which he killed a man by using excessive force, Burke is chosen to pass as an inmate of a state prison where several mysterious deaths have been reported.  With the help of Warden Golan (Stacy Keach), Burke finds himself mired in a sort of prisoners' fight club.  The unrated film is fast-paced and action-filled, though surely no contender for acting awards.
 This is an example of the action sub-genre ""men behind bars.""  These are films in which tension is created within the walls of a prison, where there is plenty of opportunity to injure or even kill a fellow inmate out of view of the guards.  If the plot seems familiar, the execution shows skill, particularly in the editing department.  There are no extras.",1231632000,3,1059,4.769230769230769
