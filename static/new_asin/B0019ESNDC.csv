8273820,5,B0019ESNDC,"As The Killer is to John Woo's canon, so The Heroic Ones is to Chang Cheh's -- the purest expression of the director's thematic interests, style, storytelling, and action choreography.

One of the first things you notice about The Heroic Ones is how sloppy it can be.  Wobbly tracking shots, rough sound, vertigo-inducing zooms and big, sometimes cartoonish acting.  And that faintly ridiculous Shaw Brothers technique of shooting night scenes in the day, underexposed, to pass for night shots -- resulting in night scenes with a blue sky.  However, if you can look past these elements, you'll find a martial-arts classic that delivers a gut punch like no other kung-fu film.

The ""Iron Triangle"" of Chang Cheh, Ti Lung and David Chiang works well here.  While Chiang and Ti don't get as much of a chance to interact in this story, in the same way as in films like Have Sword, Will Travel and Blood Brothers, The Heroic Ones utilizes their strengths well.  Chiang is a devilish, carelessly charming presence with a sensitive core, and Ti is best playing the earnest, courageous hero battling impossible odds.  Both make for very likeable heroes to the story.  Chang Cheh regular Ku Feng also helps the film with one of his rare turns as a good guy, and this is one of his best performances.  His character Li Ke Yung is almost impossibly stupid, but that is essential to the story, and even when you lament his obliviousness to what's happening, you feel his love for his sons, which is the most important element of the story.  The scene where Li orders the execution of his two traitorous sons is terrific.  Wang Chung, one of Chang Cheh's most underrated actors, is also great as the treacherous Kang Jun Li, who acts as a Iago-like character to fourth brother Li Tsun-xin (Nangong Hsun).  A good thing, too, since Nangong is relatively flat, playing the character as a villain with no redeeming qualities.

The fight scenes are tremendous, way over the top, with the centerpiece being Shi Jing Si (Ti Lung)'s desperate fight to rescue his father from a horde of soldiers.  Here, choreographers Liu Chia-liang and Tang Jie are at a blinding peak, designing moves that are exciting, specific, and crystal-clear.  Ti Lung cuts a swath through the opposition with a grace that reminds me of Toshiro Mifune's dance through his opponents in Akira Kurosawa's Sanjuro.  While these scenes could have benefitted from less camera sloppiness, they are still possibly the peak of the Chang Cheh's vast kung-fu canon.  And David Chiang, playing legendary hero Li Tsun-xiao, also turns in some nice spear work, and as in almost all of Chang Cheh's martial-arts films, every character moves in a specific way that says as much about them as dialogue and expressions in Western-style acting.  Liu Chia-liang has always been studious of different schools of martial arts, outfitting the characters with move sets that are unique to each character, and this is an element that's missing from most martial-arts films made in the West.  This specificity greatly adds to the physical expression of the characters, right down to the nameless black-clad ""Crow Guards"" who join Ti Lung in the central battle.  And the climax of the film is an extraordinarily bloody, grandly staged execution that will have you going, ""Did I really see that?""  Suffice to say, this film turns classic notions of protagonists, conflict and structure on their head, but somehow, it works very well, even in its extended denouement where many secondary characters suddenly take over the story.

The music in this film is also wrenching and horrific, a perfect companion to the frenetic and bloody action.  A brief subplot in the middle about a woman Li Tsun-xiao meets is extremely superficial, but doesn't take much away from the film.  As with all Chang Cheh films, this film is about masculine bonding, brotherhood and betrayal, valour in the face of overwhelming odds.  And in terms of delivering those themes while keeping you horrified yet glued to the screen, excited yet repulsed, The Heroic Ones may just be the greatest Chang Cheh film.",1265587200,,4106,4.923076923076923
8273821,5,B0019ESNDC,"This movie is easily on my top 10(Kung Fu Flick)list. It is undeniably the ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"" of Action. It incldues SOOO many DEATHS(300),Betrayel(between brothers),FANTASIC fighting scenes,likeable Characters,& best of all its remastered beautifully. Like Hip Hop songs Kung fu flicks too have,what are known as punchlines;which are basically eye blowing memorable scenes,& this movie has PLENTY of them. Your kung fu colletion is not complete without this movie,so if you don't have it
...I suggest U get your B.A.R.S. up!",1253232000,2,532,5.5
8273822,4,B0019ESNDC,"The newly-inserted bits of sound effects are more manageable than the highly irregular english subtitles, which will send readers into the sensation their eyeballs are being stabbed by a very sharp sword! If you muddle through, however, ""The Heroic Ones"" is an epic by bodycount alone.  The plot's been recounted already by others, so any newcomers to Shaw Brothers DVDs will admire Chang Cheh's film; fortunately, it's easier to follow than ""The Water Margin"" (though repeated efforts finally beared fruit for me: it's awesome in its own way), so muddled subtitles won't bother those who prefer these over english dubs. Could Well Go USA check out the end product BEFORE pressing all those DVDs?",1252627200,,696,5.105263157894737
8273823,4,B0019ESNDC,"Presented in glorious SHAW-SCOPE ""The Heroic Ones"" DVD released by Well Go USA under the Sword Masters name boasts a beautiful wide screen video transfer to say the least. After closer inspection of the disc it's clear the video transfer is from the recent digitally remastered Celestial Pictures version. The sound on the other hand is not so great and could have been done much better even though there is a 5.1 sound option. It seems that something was out of sync when the soundtrack was being done and it's inconsistent when listening to the English dubbed version. Make no mistake; this is a five star Shaw Brothers Martial Arts classic, but I had to take off a star for the sound quality problems.

Produced in 1970 by the Legendary Shaw Brothers Studios ""Sap Sam Tai Bo"" (Hong Kong: Cantonese title) or ""The Heroic Ones"" (Hong Kong: original subtitled version) is a kung fu feast for martial arts fans. In my opinion no other Kung Fu duo provided more deadly blows or high flying action than David Chiang and Ti Lung in the 1970's Shaw Brothers films. If you're looking for a martial arts classic filled with epic battles ridiculously high body counts, plenty of blood and the who's who of the martial arts world, you've come to the right place.

The Shaw Brothers went all out in 1970 on ""The Heroic Ones"" and the cast of Martial artists used was proof of their ongoing commitment to making the most incredible martial arts movies possible. Once again David Chiang and Ti Lung are at their very best and the rest of the cast doesn't disappoint either. I have to admit that as much as I like the amazing David Chiang, he does take a back seat to Ti Lung in ""The Heroic Ones"" The fighting is fierce and the magnificent battle scenes are truly spectacular for a 1970 film and they could easily rival some of Hollywood's best even today.

Other notable martial artists in ""The Heroic Ones"" include Lily Li, Chin Han, James Nam, Wang Chung and the great Bolo Yeung albeit in a small role and the list goes on. For David Chiang fans including myself, his final scene is as memorable as they come and something not easily forgotten. I really enjoyed seeing ""The Heroic Ones"" again in all its remastered glory despite the sound problems and I look forward to more Shaw Brothers classics from Well Go USA.

8273824,5,B0019ESNDC,"An allstar-stellar cast and the most invested film of it's time -a purported million dollars or more was apparently spent on this production- Ku feng, deservedly is cast as the father of an elite clan of sons who are all very good warriors. David Chiang and Ti Lung are his favorites though and this is beginning to offend some of their siblings leading to a revolt and tragedy for the entire family. This film probably has one of the highest or THE highest body count of any Shaw Brothers film. Bolo even makes an apparence in the beginning of the story. Extremely well written, an all out production, with fine acting make this film a must have by any Shaw Bros. collector.  If this DVD comes with the english dubbs Shaws fans are instore for quite a treat.  The translations are excellent for the english dubbs in this film.",1220227200,8,827,4.543624161073826
