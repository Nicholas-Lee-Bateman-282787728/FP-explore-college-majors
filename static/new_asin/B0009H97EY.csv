8060755,3,B0009H97EY,"Weird enough to make it well worth watching, assuming you're into bizarre, 70s martial arts films. If you like trippy stuff like The Executioner, Soul of Chiba, Master of the Flying Guillotine, Taoism Drunkard, or Fantasy Mission Force, then this movie will be right up your alley.",1438905600,,281,5.0
8060756,1,B0009H97EY,"This film is one of my guilty pleasures and I'm still trying to find it uncut (because it is hilarious).  Alas this is censored down to bleeping out ""damn it"".  It is that bad!!!  Avoid at all costs.",1159228800,,199,4.184210526315789
8060757,3,B0009H97EY,"Bruce Li in New Guinea (also known as Bruce in New Guinea and Last Fist of Fury) isn't your typical Bruceploitation film.  Oh, there's plenty of kung fu action, but things take a weird turn early on in this strangely enjoyable albeit rather silly movie from 1977.  Bruce Li plays Kwong Lee, an anthropologist who agrees to travel with his friend to Snake Worship Island in New Guinea; the idea of studying the culture of the sects there doesn't seem to interest him very much at first, but at the first mention of the devil sect which lives there, he's more than ready to go.  A couple of stereotypically goofy guides lead Kwong Lee and his buddy to the island, where they soon meet up with a reluctant sacrifice-to-be maiden who dies of poison just after they find her.  The snake people, the story goes, were a good tribe under the leadership of the dead king, but now the Great Wizard of the devil sect has taken over, holding the princess Ankawa in his power.  Naturally, the Great Wizard is a master of the snake fist style of fighting, and everybody around him knows kung fu.  Kwong Lee and pal soon find this out firsthand, at which point Kwong Lee disappears.  He turns up again several days or months later, acting strangely; the cure for this is, of course, a flashback, wherein we see him fight the Great Wizard and fall victim to one of the skeleton-masked one's ""tricks.""  The beautiful princess Ankawa saves him by keeping him warm (and I'm not talking about wrapping him up or starting a fire in the fireplace).  Love soon blossoms, but Kwong Lee is forced to leave, vowing to return.

Return he does, after practicing his defense against the snake fist fighting style (things would have been a whole lot simpler if he had just bought a gun).  Several surprises await him when he arrives on the island, but he spends most of his time fighting, taking on both the devil sect and a trio of raiders out to steal the precious snake pearl.  This is certainly not the most impressive display of kung fu I've ever seen, but it isn't that bad.  The presence of deadly snakes in the film certainly helps it in my book, but this positive addition is more than offset by the inclusion of an ape who apparently understands Chinese and, unless my eyes deceived me, wears shoes.  Curses and dark magic are fine, but there really ought to be a law against including exceedingly intelligent apes in films of any and all kinds.  Perhaps my favorite oddity about Bruce Li in New Guinea comes in the form of a little love potion Ankawa slips into Kwong Lee's drink before he leaves her; apparently, any female who looks at him with anything more than friendship on her mind suddenly sees him as a great big nasty snake. Stupid - yes; but pretty cool - yes.

It's sort of nice to watch one of these Bruceploitation films and actually journey outside of Hong Kong or China, and Ankawa is an even more pleasant sight than our exotic locale.  I would give this film four stars, but I always deduct a star for the inclusion of intelligent, fake apes in movies.  If you like all of the Bruce Lee clone movies the way I do, you should get a kick out of Bruce Li in New Guinea; otherwise, you'll probably rebel against its sometimes silly plot.",1137542400,2,3232,4.486348122866894
8060758,1,B0009H97EY,"This movie is so horrible that it's hilarious to watch.  The corny special effects, awful camera shots, horrible sound effects and terribly outdated dialogue all mix together to be so awful that you'll be on the floor laughing your tush off.  As a Kung Fu film it blows, but as comedy, it doesn't get any better than this!  If you're up for loads of laughs, this is your film.",1076284800,,376,4.420289855072464

8060760,3,B0009H97EY,"like people were saying on the reviews it's a bad movie it really is but its still watchable entertainment its mainly for people in to the 1970's style martial arts flick, don't expect anything more.",1033776000,,199,4.714285714285714
8060761,5,B0009H97EY,"I must say seriously, this is the best Bruce Li movie ever made.  The fight scenes are pretty good for him.  It's an adventure and really cool, different-looking martial arts film.  The characters are funny and laughable just as real Bruce lee movie characters are.  I still have this film after recording it years ago when I was 12 years old.  Really its not that bad.  ""Do you know where the snake pearl is"" hahahah.",1006992000,2,418,4.506666666666667
8060762,1,B0009H97EY,"This is the WORST movie I have ever seen, This beats out ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", and ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" for worst movie ever.  Here is the plot: Bruce Li, a cheap rip-off of the real  Bruce Lee, and his friend go to ""snake worship island"", where  they find some strange natives. They fight,terrible fight scenes, then they  meet up with the ""snake wizard"", who has the Princess of the  island hostage, they fight, bruce eventually wins, and everything is O.K.  But if you watch this movie, you will know just how bad it is, i.e. the  fact that you see powerlines and old tin cans on the ""uncharted  island, that only primative natives live on"", or the  ""gorilla""(a man in a very cheap chinese monkey suit), or the  dubbing(the worst that i have ever seen), or the pointless scenes of nudity  that have nothing to do with the movie.  If you want to see a terrible  movie, watch this one, I ""collect"" terrible movies, and this is  the crown jewel of my collection.",946252800,,982,4.47457627118644
8060763,4,B0009H97EY,"This is one of my favorite martial arts films of all time.the story line is written in such a meticulous fashion that no detail has been omitted. this is a story of love, betrayal, honor, and action. This is the perfect  film for any youngsters who might be interested in pursuing a life in the  martial arts. PURE GENIUS! The ONLY martial arts film that the whole family  should see.",945216000,,384,4.457142857142857
