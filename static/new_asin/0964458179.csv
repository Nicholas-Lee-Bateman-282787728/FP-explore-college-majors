7794595,5,0964458179,"This is the most wonderful series.  We own the Big Aquarium and the Big Zoo.  My seven-year-old will watch the Aquarium over and over if I would let him.  My four-year-old loves both of the videos and has learned so much.  He has talked to me about ""endangered"" animals and how Rhino horns are made of Keratin.  The seven-year-old is just amazed at the behind the scenes information on how big places like these work.  He can't get enough.  They learn facts about animals and how they are taken care of by professionals.  Not just what the names of the animals are.  These videos go beyond that without being complicated or hard to follow.  They are awesome and I highly recommend them to anyone with inquisitive kids.",1189036800,3,718,4.582677165354331
7794596,5,0964458179,My 3 1/2 year old grandson rented this movie from the library.  I can't tell you how many times this was watched in a week!  My husband loved it so much we had to buy one.  It is a great movie for kids and adults alike.,1147478400,2,219,3.717391304347826
7794597,5,0964458179,"I've always appreciated that this series doesn't dumb its subject matter down. The Big Aquarium is no exception. Shot on location at the Tennessee Aquarium, this feature is entertaining and educational. Unlike many kids programs, there are no humans in goofy costumes, no singing and no precious moments. The animals are the stars. They aren't sensationalized as ""The world's deadliest"" or ""Amazing killing machines"", just as fascinating creatures from around the world. My son loved this when he was four and five years old, and he (actually, we) watched it over and over.",1140998400,8,573,5.172043010752688
7794598,5,0964458179,We thought this was a very nice video for the children and we enjoyed it also.  They enjoy learning about the aquarium and seeing the animals and now I am looking for another one.  We also have the zoo video and that is also great.,1106697600,,231,4.111111111111111
