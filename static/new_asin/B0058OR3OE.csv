I was so excited after blood in blood out thinking man this will be awesome... MAJOR let down... I do NOT recommend...",1352419200,5,272,4.46
4601508,3,B0058OR3OE,"This movie was alright.  It wasn't the best but it was still entertaining.  If you like this type of movie, I highly and strongly suggest the movies ""Blood in blood out"" ""American me"" and ""Warriors""",1336348800,,198,4.628571428571429
4601509,5,B0058OR3OE,"One of the worst movies ive seen, but for the price it was worth the view. You could always hire it. Damian Chapa best movie was Blood in Blood out and American me, after that he went downhill. Always trying to make gang movies with him as the kin Pin. Maybe he should make a movie on the Latin Kings.",1333238400,,301,4.033333333333333
4601510,5,B0058OR3OE,Great movie if you like Gangster films. It was a low budget but I realy liked the action and it had a cool  movement. If you liked Damian Chapa in Blood in Blood out You will love this film.,1330128000,,190,3.871794871794872
4601511,1,B0058OR3OE,Bought this movie for my husband since he was a big Blood in and Blood out fan but I have to say I also watched this movie and it was bad acting was horrible filmed very bad also. We were very disapointed:( Thought it would have been a lil better we knew it wasn't a part 2 to blood in and blood out but it SUCKED!!!,1328745600,,316,3.803030303030303
8462135,2,B0058OR3OE,"The story is great in itself, but this movie fails to deliver in many ways.

like many other people, I thought it was gonna be a sequel to Blood In Blood Out, sadly it wasn't. First off, the vdeo qaulity changes dramaticallyfrom one scene to another and sometimes in the same scene when it cuts from one angle to another, secondly, you can see multiple mess-ups by the camera crew, for example, I saw The boom operator mic in many diferente scenes, and another scene where you can clearly see the camera's light shinning bright on Esteban's face in the schoolyard fight scene.

I just feel that this would have been a better movie if it had a bigger budget, more character development for all the main characters, especially The Chinese guy, we barely know much about his past, and it Also wouldn't have hurt to give Esteban and his brother more one on one time when they were adults.",1488931200,,884,4.51875

8462141,4,B0058OR3OE,"There's a gritty authenticity to VATOS LOCOS that was generated in part from the Cinema Verite choice of using actual and 'real' gang members in most of the principal roles. To those unfamiliar with the drug and gang culture, the acting might appear stilted or inconsistent with traditional Hollywood stereotypes. But for those in the know, the moments and beats are as real as the guns and the gangstas behind them. Clearly a low-budget film, and challenged technically at times, VATOS GATOS is still worth seeing for its raw and real portrayal of Latino-Asian gang conflicts in urban America.",1401235200,,594,5.01010101010101
8462142,2,B0058OR3OE,"All I can say is wow! This movie was not what i was expecting from a star that was in one of the greatest movie's of all time Blood In Blood Out. Very low budget and really not worth the money or the time it took to order or watch. Maybe one day there will be another great movie such as American Me, Blood In Blood Out, Boulevard Nights, or Walking Proud.",1398902400,,356,3.9583333333333335
8462143,1,B0058OR3OE,"Whoa!  What up, ese?! Oracle', homies...what were you smoking when you filmed this?  The plot line was terrible.  The characters...unbelievable. And the editing was so Junior High School.  This flick pales in comparison to such East LA classics as ""My Family""...""American Me""...""Blood in...Blood out"". I'm sorry, I was hoping that ""Vato Locos""...would be a keeper in my film library...but instead...I'm sending it to my home boy back in the Varrio to use it for target practice.

OSO...Varrio Venice",1362355200,2,499,5.346153846153846
