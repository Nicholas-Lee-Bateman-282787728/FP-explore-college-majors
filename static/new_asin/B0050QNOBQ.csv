4517914,5,B0050QNOBQ,"A friend recommended this video to me and I have to say that I was skeptical at first but ended up loving it.  I don't normally do yoga so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was worried it'd be too lofty and hippy dippy but all of the Titans had such amazing and relatable stories.  I was touched and inspired and came away feeling like I'd learned more about the entire world of yoga and all of its benefits.  I definitely recommend this film to all who want to laugh, learn and be entertained.",1318204800,9,493,4.157894736842105
4517915,5,B0050QNOBQ,"This is a really good movie featuring the top yoga teachers from US. Very inspirational to hear their personal stories from drug abuse, HIV/Aids, and many other issues that made them who they are now. After the movie I felt inspired to practice yoga again and the next day I walked into my neighborhood yoga studio. YEAH! At first I thought why are the really big names of yoga (mostly Eastern...) not in the movie, but it said on their website that the focus of the movie was to highlight the modern masters of yoga, meditation and mindfulness from the West. Makes sense... Anyway, I loved the movie and can only recommend it.",1317686400,7,627,4.557522123893805
4517916,3,B0050QNOBQ,"The video ""Titans of Yoga"" has twenty yoga experts talking about the importance of yoga and why they practice it. While some of their comments on yoga are accurate, such as that yoga connects you to everything around you, the video overall is uninspiring. Most of the yoga experts do not radiate happiness and positivity. One yoga expert did seem to be happy but was the exception in the group. Not that fun to watch.",1394323200,2,417,4.573333333333333
4517917,5,B0050QNOBQ,"This was the movie that convinced me to do Yoga. I love their real stories and all the results they achieved from this practice. After watching this DVD with me, my husband and friends are going to Yoga too. If I don't see real people talking and telling me their real life results I may not be motivated to start something. That's why I love this movie.",1385337600,,354,4.298507462686567
4517918,3,B0050QNOBQ,Not much on yoga. Lot of interviews that we could see on youtube. It's similar to watching The secret where each yoga instructor has their say about yoga,1371427200,2,153,4.5
4517919,5,B0050QNOBQ,"I am into yoga, teachers featured in this dvd of inspiration and healing magic are great. Most of the teachers here have grown up from children in to full grown Yogi`s,Some where once crippled,and some once abused and drug addicted. They share short stories of their journeys through life before yoga and after yoga. I was sad that they running time is so short. The teachers here are also common in the world of fitness dvds and live in famous studio`s.",1361923200,,454,4.617283950617284
4517920,4,B0050QNOBQ,"Enjoyed watching the different interviews but didn't like how it kept jumping from one to another.  I would have preferred someone asking each the same question and then showing each of the responses and going to the next question or an actual interview with one person and then moving to the next.  Overall, pretty good.",1341273600,,321,4.818181818181818
4517921,3,B0050QNOBQ,There are many good Yogi in this DVD I like.  I like how they share their own experience and insight.  I just going to donate it to the library for others to watch.  Because it is not some thing I need to watch again and again.,1338422400,,227,3.891304347826087
4517922,5,B0050QNOBQ,"...do excuse the title of this review-I could not help myself! This is an excellent DVD for beginners to Yoga, advanced students, and also for teachers alike. It is wonderful because you get to hear intimate stories from some of the most influential yoga instructors. A beautiful way to reconnect even more with your practice! Highly recommend it-wonderful teachers and a fun, and inspiring watch!!",1337212800,,398,5.138461538461539
4517923,1,B0050QNOBQ,"was looking forward to watch this!!!

Would not recommend it !
Kind regards

4517924,5,B0050QNOBQ,"What an amazing film. We have watched this several times. Bought it originally when it first came out and loved it. Unfortunately the DVD was destroyed, but this was worth purchasing again to own. I keep showing it to all my friends, everyone loves the interviews.",1330560000,2,264,4.760869565217392
4517925,5,B0050QNOBQ,"Very good movie with amazing yoga teachers: Dr. Dean Ornish, Lilias Folan, Gurmukh Khalsa, Bryan Kest, Sharon Gannon, David Life, Dharma Mittra, Seane Corn, Shiva Rea, Beth Shaw, John Friend, Gary Kraftsow, Ana Forrest, David Swenson, Deva Premal and Miten, Kim Eng, Sara Ivanhoe, Swami Kriyananda, Larry Payne, Vinnie Marino, Lisa Walford, Krishna Kaur, Rajashree Choudhury, Saul David Raye. Hard to believe that most of them went through lots of pain and suffering before becoming masters of yoga.",1318377600,4,499,5.410256410256411

8451696,3,B0050QNOBQ,"There are beautiful words of wisdom here as in most yoga documentaries. Although, at times, the editing in this will irritate you, for example when a yogini mentions being HIV in 1985 and the documentary moves to a different person speaking about another problem, and then the documentary goes back to the yogini that speaks more about her past difficulties with HIV. It would be nicer if there were fewer short sound bites, and instead allowed the yogi's and yogini's to speak longer at certain times.
Generally, the film was about modern style of yoga or asana's, and even when the film spoke about meditation or union with everything it tended to be as a result of asana's (or the physical aspects of yoga) as opposed to the other limbs of yoga. But that's okay, if you love yoga as I do, you will enjoy and benefit from this documentary.",1471305600,,841,4.613333333333333
