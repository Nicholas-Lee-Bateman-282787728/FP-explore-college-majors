8528444,4,B008I74GM0,"I only wish they made more.  It truly is a fun-filled series.  It is not compatible with any US readers unless you have a code-free player.  I simply hooked up my PC to my TV via HDMI (VGA and Speaker OUT also) and used the pc on my TV.  The disk player will allow you to change the region up to 5 (five) times.  So the last time, change it back to the US regions.  Once the region is changed to accomidiate the SOLO region, you can continue to watch the series without problem - via - PC on and OFF each night, but also only the region for Europe unless you pop in the US DVD.  That is change number 1 (one.)  After watching the entire series on your PC, pop in another movie from US region and it will change to accommodate, and this will be change number 2 (two.)  It you care to watch the series again, it would be change three...  and so on..  But you only get 5 (FIVE) total!  If you have mutiple PCs you can have each PC on a different region - without ever changing them once they have been identified via region.  Just to add knowledge, your PCs code is pretty smart - so it does it all for you, no thinking.  Or buy a No Region or All Region DVD player.",1392768000,2,1163,3.9783549783549783
8528445,5,B008I74GM0,"I had been looking for this DVD for many years.  I had seen the series when it was on cable years ago, mainly because I liked Felicity Kendal in ""Good Neighbors"" (American title).  Even though this is comedy, it tends to be more serious.  You will get your laugh quota filled with this series (13 episodes) with no problem though.  The British accents can be a bit thick at times, but that is what replay is for if you happen to miss something.  It is just as good the second time anyway.  The Felicity Kendal interview on the second DVD is something you will want to watch immediately upon getting this.  It is a recent interview, so she also talks about some of her more current projects and desires.  Only thing is...this DVD is coded for region 2 (Europe), so you will need a DVD player that will play region 2 or ""all region"" to be able to view this series.  If you only have a standard US model, sorry...it won't play.  But guess what...it would be worth it to get online and search for ""all region DVD players"" and buy one.  I would currently suggest the Toshiba model SD5300 DVD player (price about $60 + shipping).  ENJOY!!!!  Also, consider buying ""Good Neighbors"", too.  With both of these you'll fall in love with her.",1369958400,5,1230,4.433035714285714
8528446,5,B008I74GM0,"I love anything with Felicity Kendal in it!  This show did not last long and I think people were looking for another great comedy like ""Good Neighbors"" (which it is not), so it was not that popular.  It was very hard to find, but I'm glad I was able to get it...and in DVD format.

Thank you,
M.",1360108800,,295,4.051724137931035
8528447,4,B008I74GM0,"Very dated now, but a great look into pop culture from 30+ years ago. Loved this actress in ""The Good Life"" (released in the USA as ""Good Neighbors""), so naturally I had to see this. It ran only once in the USA and I had all but forgotten about it till I saw it for sale. Nice trip back in time to my teens.

If in the USA you WILL need a ""region free"" DVD player to watch this. It is made for the UK; 24 frames per second, unlike the USA, 30 frames per second. The differences are also known as ""NTSC"" or ""Region 1"" for the USA, and ""PAL"" or ""Region 2"" for the UK. Region free/universal players are now available pretty inexpensively (unless you want a region free Blue Ray, that will be a bit more).  Glad I got both the player and this walk down memory lane.",1347321600,7,761,4.033112582781457
