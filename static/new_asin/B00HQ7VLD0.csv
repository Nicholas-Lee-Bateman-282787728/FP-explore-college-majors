6196023,5,B00HQ7VLD0,"This film has some of the best fights I've ever seen in any movie. (no matter how big the production.) The passion the film makers have for quality action really shines through. Rather than cookie-cutter choreographed dance-fighting, these fights are unique, creative, and high-impact. Furthermore, the plot is engaging and does a good job of establishing the characters' motivations. And, it's quite unexpectedly funny. (e.g. the bathroom scene.) Highly recommended.",1396051200,2,467,5.685714285714286

8634180,4,B00HQ7VLD0,"Eric Jacobus and his Stunt People are without a doubt one of the most creative and talented groups of martial arts performers the film world has ever seen. Why these guys aren't getting a film into wide distribution every other year is a matter of injustice, especially while our established group of mainstream action stars grows stale. Previously only available via indie distribution, ""Death Grip"" here hangs with 2014's top martial arts films from around the world, supplying great fights and improved production values from Jacobus'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Contour/dp/B000YGE0KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Contour</a>&nbsp;eight years ago. A questionable storyline and a lengthy gap in the fighting threaten this one's high ranking, but in the end, it's going to be worth every penny you pay for it.

The story: a troubled drifter (Jacobus) and his autistic brother (Nathan Hoskins) are inexplicably drawn into the deadly plot of an antichrist cult.

The design and tone of this film are worlds removed from Jacobus' previous feature. Whereas ""Contour"" was colorful and bombastic, ""Death Grip"" is melancholy and purposely restrained. The opening 15 minutes feature relatively little dialogue, punctuated only by an impressive three-on-one fight scene, and well-handled ambience. The film's setting is bleak and often colorless, though not without a sense of humor that's sometimes both clever and delicate. Sadly, the latter two-thirds of the picture lose a good deal of the character intrigue that the first had going for it, and in the long run, the plot involving a satanic cult trying to recover one of the coins paid for Christ's betrayal is as awkward as it sounds. Jaobus - along with fellow SP members Rebecca Ahn, Alvin Hsing, and Chelsea Steffensen - get to flex their acting muscles a bit, but I'm not sure how satisfied I am of the stereotypical, childlike representation of autism in the movie, regardless of Nathan Hoskins' strong performance.

But all faults seem to melt away as soon as the fight scenes begin. Jacobus' team is as innovative as ever, and definitely give the impression that they've taken notes while watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III/dp/B003FXXNH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Raid/dp/B0085A9J18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Raid</a>. There are six fights to be seen, and while one of them is not really in the same league as the others (i.e. the bathroom brawl), it's these other ones that properly show the world what the human body is capable of. Evenly split between one-against-many and one-on-one encounters, the choreography of these matches is imaginative in its design, beautiful in its execution, and scary in its speed. Disappointingly, much of the last two acts feature no real fighting, though viewers who endure this are rewarded with three superb back-to-back-to-back brawls. My favorite of the bunch is a hyperspeed knife fight between Jacobus and Alvin Hsing. The climatic battle is between Jacobus and Johnny Yong Bosch, the ex-Power Ranger who utterly rebuilt the action standard in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-Path/dp/B005DI2XWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken Path</a>&nbsp;and gets in a swell match here that features a ton of clever fighting tactics.

Two more fights and/or a more compelling storyline would have probably resulted in one more star in my rating, or at least would have made the current four more solid, as they currently teeter on three. In the end, for the most part, this is an early Christmas present for viewers who truly appreciate the skill and effort it takes to build a good fight scene. I think the Stunt People have yet to make their definitive, streamlined package for the world to see, but this is definitely a jump kick in the right direction.",1402272000,3,4013,5.8313458262350935
