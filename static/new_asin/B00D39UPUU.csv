5771578,5,B00D39UPUU,"I remember hearing about how bad the season was and how much I would hate Alois. However I thought the season was quite well done! Also by the end, I liked Alois; he is a complete jerk to be sure, but he had moments where I thought he was an awesome character!",1378944000,,260,4.019230769230769
5771579,5,B00D39UPUU,"When I learned that there was a second season of Black Butler, I wasn't quite sure what to think. The two people on the cover obviously weren't Ciel and Sebastian, and considering I had read thirteen volumes of manga and never seen anyone like these two, I was pretty confused. But, since people had given it such great reviews, I decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed.

The story begins with the introduction of one of the two new major characters, Alois Trancy. Like Ciel, he is a noble with a demonic butler, the bespectacled Claude Faustus, serving at his side. By the end of the first episode, his four other servants have been introduced: Hannah Annafellows and the three violet-haired triplets. Ciel and Sebastian make an appearance in Episode 1 as well, although it is very brief. The drama only gets deeper from there, with an immediate rivalry developing between Ciel and Alois, as well as between the two demon butlers.

While the story is very intense and suspenseful, it must be mentioned that this season is MUCH more adult than Season 1. There is a great deal of barely-concealed sexual innuendo, stronger language, more gore, and several disturbing themes including child molestation, which is found in the first few minutes of Episode 1 and mentioned or implied repeatedly throughout the series. As a result, this season is rated TV-MA, as opposed to TV-14 in the first season. That said, it is still very enjoyable, but parents with children who are fans of the series may want to keep this in mind, as some of the material is very disturbing and lends a much more ""demonic"" feel to the series as a whole.

Now, on to the box set itself. The box contains 5 discs: 3 DVDs and 2 Blu-rays. The DVDs contain episodes 1-6 on Disc 1, 7-12 on Disc 2, and the 6 OVAs on Disc 3. The Blu-rays contain episodes 1-9 on Disc 1, and episodes 10-12 and the 6 OVAs on Disc 2. The casing it comes in is pretty sturdy, and standard for a Blu-ray set. A minor issue I noticed, though, was how easily the pieces of plastic that fit in the center of the discs to hold them will break. I had small pieces of plastic falling out of the case before I had even removed the discs for the first time. Overall, though, it is a very nice set, and a great value for the price.

Overall, this is a great addition to the anime series that so many people know and love. It is a great deal more adult in content, though, so parents should be mindful of that if they have very young teens who watch the show. If you're okay with that, though, then do yourself a favor and pick up a copy right now!",1377302400,24,2595,4.388773388773389
5771580,5,B00D39UPUU,This was a great second season to my favorite anime series. The addition of another demon butler added another area of drama and interesting plot movements to add to the endless humor that black butler is full of.,1375747200,4,213,4.631578947368421
5771581,5,B00D39UPUU,"My copy of this just arrived today and I can ensure to you that despite the misleading title it is in fact a Blu-Ray and DVD Combo Pack just like it should be. Of course the image and the description should have been enough proof but I'm just saying this to eliminate all doubt. The case is nearly identical in style to the complete season one except in a smaller, more normal case.

It comes with all 12 episodes and the 6 OVAs.",1374537600,27,429,4.168674698795181

5771585,5,B00D39UPUU,"I LOVE Black Butler! I own Season 1, posters, blankets, playing cards, etc, and it was about time I added Season 2 to my collection. I've watched Black Butler on Netflix several times, and when their license expired, I just had to buy it. This comes with English and Japanese audio, and the Japanese audio includes subtitles as promised. The extra OVA's are great as well! If you love Black Butler like I do, there is no reason NOT to buy this. I PROMISE you that you won't find this for a better price elsewhere!",1496793600,,513,4.410526315789474

5771587,4,B00D39UPUU,I like the series so far and I know that its regarded to many as a bad second season but the mindset I had was that the 2 people created for the season are basically ripoffs and their fighting against the originals and that just sorta works for me to watch this season. Now keep in mind that this is merely a season that forgets huge things that happened in season one so just go along with it and ignore it since it'll just keep hitting you over and over with them basically so just treat it as a minor annoyance. To be honest its like if the old series got a lot of money and started to make a whole new season and completely cut itself off from the old series by getting a newer animation style and forgot what they did near the end of the series. And also it adds characters for no reason except to maybe add a bit more of what worked so well in the original since if its not broken don't fix it right. Its okay and doesn't require you needing to read the series of books.,1490227200,,976,4.036082474226804
5771588,5,B00D39UPUU,Another butler? Thank you! I adore this season and so long as you keep in mind that this is an alternate reality it make the whole season much more injoyable. Oh- this season is lucky more sadistic for the first 2-5 episodes but well worth it.,1489881600,,243,4.304347826086956

5771592,5,B00D39UPUU,I just got this in the mail today and I haven't watched it yet but I am super excited!! I know this won't help a lot of people but the package came quick in my view. It took a week and I always expect packages to be late but I was so surprised! The only tiny problem I had was how they packaged it I also bought a black butler book with it and they just staked them on top of each other and had bubble wrap only at the bottom so the book was a bit bent and the movie/series had a little scratch but I'm not going to be picky so they did a really good job and I cant wait to buy the next season!,1482451200,,594,3.6484375

Some of the story is a little less appealing for me, such as the demon side but overall, it's cute enough that I don't mind watching it with her.  You have to like anime tho, which I do.

5771604,5,B00D39UPUU,"This season kind of sucks, but Amazon did a wonderful job of getting it to me safely and not damaged. The packaging was really great, no dents. But buy season 1 and 3 instead. Alois Trancy will give you a headache in season 2. He's comparable to Joffrey Baratheon... I recommend watching season 1 episodes 1-15 and then skipping to season 3. Season 3 is really fantastic actually.",1463443200,4,380,4.602941176470588

5771611,5,B00D39UPUU,I'm a anime fan an d this anime is magnificent... one of my favorites,1454284800,,69,4.0
5771612,4,B00D39UPUU,"First let me start by saying, after watching the end of Season 1 I was not left empty, as I figured Ciel had been devoured which only seemed fitting given the nature of that particular Anime. Then came Season 2. At first glance I believed it would be a separate story all together since the box cover showed a new young boy (and what I assumed to be Sebastian fulfilling another contract). I was wrong.

Second, If you enjoyed Season 1, be warned this tale of tragedy did not quite live up to the expectations of the first season. Hence the 4 stars. It is good, excellent in fact, but it is not perfect either.

The story continues with young Master Ciel Phantomhive being carried by Sebastian inside of a suitcase to the estate of another young master, Aloise Trancy. Master Trancy has made his own ""Deal with a Devil"", Claude Faustus...... Yet, Claude is not happy with his contract... as his young Aloise's ""Soul lacks flavor"" and devouring the ""Bland"" selfish brat,  Aloise would be un-satisfying... So what is a poor demon to do... Steal the contract of another...Sebastian's..... This game of Demon Chess will by played for the one thing they both desire most... As both Butlers and Masters try to out smart, out maneuver, and out class the other it strategy and combat, the end will come at a price, and the ultimate prize...the chance to devour the soul of Ciel Phantomhive.

And like Ciel.... In the end, I was left with a glorious emptiness. There was by no means, in my opinion, any other way for this tale of dark deception and tragedy to end.....",1453939200,7,1559,4.577060931899641

5771628,4,B00D39UPUU,"I love Black Butler. This is a great follow up to the first season. However, fare warning. This is a shorter season and is a bit rushed. If you enjoyed the first season, you'll enjoy this second season too. However, in my opinion the first season can stand alone as a complete series.",1439424000,3,284,4.377358490566038

5771631,4,B00D39UPUU,"This anime as a whole is pretty amazing. I loved S1 so much that even now sometimes I just go back and re-watch the entire thing twice, once in Japanese (which I prefer) and then again in English. S2 two is good but in my opinion not as good as S1 because I couldn't stand Alois. That kid annoyed the hell out of me from start to finish so I kind of zoned just a little on the episodes focusing more on him. But Claude was interesting and I liked the contrast to him as a butler with Sebastian. I'm glad I got S2 even though if you want me to be honest it's sort of a stand alone season, however it's Black Butler so even as a stand alone it's entertaining to watch.

I'm already dying for them to release S3 onto DVD with hopefully more extras like on the S1 and S2 DVDs. S3 like S1 is a great season. Anyway if you liked S1 I think you should own/see S2. There are episodes that are wonderful and heart breaking and shocking so well worth the money.",1434499200,,951,4.031746031746032

5771636,5,B00D39UPUU,"I actually saw this season first and the original first season some time afterwards. As other reviewers have mentioned the second season has most of it's focus on Alois Trancy and Claude Fasutus., and it more or less can stand alone as a separate storyline apart from ""Black Butler 1"" and ""Book of Circus"". I still found this series to be super enjoyable even though at the time I didn't know any backstory concerning Ciel and Sebastian. I loved the characters of Alois and Claude, and I found them to be very original. When they encounter Sebastian and Ciel, the contrasts between them all is fascinating. Alois is a spoiled brat with a serious co-dependency problem and a sadistic sense of humor. Ciel, of course, is extremely reserved and seldom seems to have a sense of humor at all as he is solely focused on finding the killers of his parents. When they encounter each other it's fireworks. Claude and Sebastian on the other hand, both demon butlers, have a lot in common. However, where Claude is cold and efficient, Sebastian (as we all know) does everything with a supreme style all his own. Watching Sebastian and Claude seethe at each other is engrossing, especially when they both end up pursuing the same quarry. Anyway, I may not be the target demographic for this show but I thought it was amazing, entertaining, thought provoking, and quite often over-the-top. The relationship between Sebastian and Ciel is like nothing I have ever seen before, and I find it almost endlessly fascinating. Even though all he wants to do is eat his soul, sometimes the story goes a little too far in portraying Sebastian's desire for Ciel. If this was made in the US, the whole ""grown man obsessed with a young teenager"" angle would likely be diminished but I get the feeling that in Japan such a situation is more played for laughs or just part of the drama so that is the way I choose to look at it. If you liked the first series, this one is just as good even if the whole focus is not on Sebastian and Ciel. Honestly I actually like this season the best and find it more entertaining than ""Book of Circus"". Recommended.",1428192000,,2122,4.601583113456464

Could they have added more episodes and seasons, sure.  They could also add post seasons as well, but that's up to the artist.

This is dark and supernatural anime.  The humor, the characters, the storyline, however, it does have moments of standard humor.  Its not a scare fest, and its just a good storyline.",1425600000,,467,4.423529411764706

5771649,5,B00D39UPUU,"At the end of season one Ciel is near death and per the contract made with his demon butler Sebastian, his soul is now ready for devouring. However, there's another demon butler and a human boy hell bent on getting Ciel for themselves and they'll stop at nothing to get him.

This season was way too short but also a lot more adult. Like a lot. I thought there was a misprint on the TV rating since it's rated TV-MA while season one is TV-14. Black Butler 2 eventually shows its viewers the distinct difference with the rating since this season contains more bloody violence, many sexual innuendos as well as very significantly disturbing scenes that not only hint but obviously lead to a child's sexual abuse but it is not explicit nor seen.

I feel as though season 2 was much better than season one however it's much shorter. If you loved season one, you'll enjoy season 2 and you'll definitely enjoy the news that there's a season three called Book of Circus that's on YouTube.",1419984000,15,981,4.536723163841808

5771661,4,B00D39UPUU,"Fair warning, this season stands alone, as in that it's anime only content not found in the manga and relates to it in no such manner. Taking that into consideration, I still liked this season despite it's set backs and what not. Yes, Alois is bratty and Claude is stuffy but they still have a redeeming charm. Hanna is somewhat of a mystery to me and felt like another Angela from the first season. And don't worry, the story still focuses heavily on Sebastian and Ciel, just more characters are added to further the story along. The ending was a little depressing and Ciel's behavior is down right terrible at the end. Yes, he was rude and unfriendly up to the ending because that's how he was but he still had a shred of humanity but at the end, he was downright horrible. Anyway, it's not like the first or the newly installed third series, but it does stand alone as a solid pieces despite it's shortcomings.",1410307200,2,913,4.473053892215569

5771667,5,B00D39UPUU,"This is the continue-ation of the first Black Butler show.

Plot and characters (minor spoilers) : Following the events after the first season ended, introducing Alois Trancy an Earl like Ciel is, but Alois is a super bratty spoiled child who wants everything and nothing at the same time. His demon butler Claude to tend to his every whim and wish, along with Hannah the maid and the triplets servants, Alois orders Claude to take Ciel to make Ciel Alois's proerty.

Pros: This series is rated TV-MA, the first season is TV-14. So TV-MA means (in the show) More blood and more darkness and more of a past behind Alois who has a past that would scar anyone.

Cons: this is only 12 episodes so its only half as long as the first series and the OVA'S are alright to say the least.

Over all: This is still  avery entertaining and will keep you on the edge of your seat!!",1405296000,3,868,4.4

5771671,4,B00D39UPUU,"From what I experienced from Season One of the series, it was more pointed towards mystery solving, all of them were on the supernatural side of things. This season has none of that, its mostly about this bratty kid named Eloise Trancy and his butler named Claude. Sebastian and Ciel do make an appearance, and the season mostly turns into ""I want Ciel's soul"" battle. It was still a good season though. Which is why I'm giving it a 4/5",1403222400,,436,4.4625

5771673,5,B00D39UPUU,"Great visuals, good acting , solid script black butler II has proven itself to be more superior than the last in many aspects. With the introduction of some very intriguing characters and much impressive story plots. It's more a less another amazing addition to the series and it includes an epic ending to sum it all off. It was def an enjoyable watch and it had alot more darkness to the series that was portrayed very well. The characters will capture your attention indeed they will and the series alone is just so fun to watch. Many of the historical context the first season had is missing and the comic relief isn't all that present but all in all still a great watch. Loved this series from the beginning and it never fails to disappoint me!",1402444800,,749,4.514705882352941

5771678,1,B00D39UPUU,"I loved the first season. I really did. It had a certain Count of Monte Cristo flair for revenge, good main characters, and a decent plot.

What. The. Hell. Happened.

*SPOILERS*

In this one, it's half the length of season 2, and only 12 episodes. Very little has to do with Ciel and Sebastian and his quest for revenge, it instead has more to do with Alois Trancy and his butler, Claude. They're terrible. Everything to like about the relationship between Ciel and Sebastian is missing. Thanks to a case of amnesia, Ciel doesn't even remember the first season's events at all. There's just random, unrelated sequences where it's Claude versus Sebastian to prove who's better, and even Ciel points out ""Well that was pointless"" after one such event.

It's more about Alois, who you TRY to feel bad for, but really...you can't. You're left like Claude going ""Why am I stuck with YOU instead of Ciel?"" In the end, the new characters all get happy endings, everything they want...and Ciel and Sebastian get screwed over. All the side characters that were comic relief in the first one are just left at the end with a dismissive ""Do what you want, I don't care"" and that's the feeling you as the audience are left with. There's a certain level of sexual undertones in the first one, especially with Grell's infatuation with Sebastian and some moments where it looks like Ciel and Sebastian might have something between them, but in this season, it's just WEIRD moments. Like Alois dresses up as a girl to talk to Ciel, he beats the hell out of Hannah, the female maid/demon and strips her naked. Even just some of the angles are weird, purposely for making it sexual, and suddenly all of the characters have an oral fixation and are licking everything in what comes off as a really perverted. I wouldn't care if that was how it was advertised, like soft core hentai, but it's not.

Supposedly, they're redoing the series following the manga, like they did with Full Metal Alchemist vs FMA Brotherhood. I'm hoping that's the case, because I have no idea how'd they salvage the mess they made.",1396396800,2,2088,4.678474114441417

Unfortunately I only first saw season 2 in Japanese, so when I found season 2 in English AND BluRay it was a must have!!  Season 2 is really for the +16 crowd due to very mature subject matter, but the storyline kept the amazing character development; plus the addition of a new demon Claude and his perverse,masochistic, master Alouise Trancy.  The voice acting is superb as in the first season, and the animation clean and beautiful.  Season 2 is a yaoi, so if that makes you uncomfortable this anime may not be for you.

5771691,5,B00D39UPUU,"What happens when you follow up an excellent anime series with an excellent sequel? You get Black Butler 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the hit anime series. It may go without saying, but you should absolutely watch the first season before watching the second season.

The second season of the popular series starts out with two new characters, and since they are on the cover of this collection, one would expect them to be the new main characters of the show. However, after watching about five minutes of the first episode, you can tell that Earl Alois Trancy (the boy on the cover) is not a nice person. His butler, Claude Faustus, looks like a clone of Sebastian from the first season; he even steals Sebastian's catchphrase.

As anyone can probably guess, Ciel and Sebastian do return in this season, as well as all the other characters from the show, so do not feel put off if you actually thought that this would be a season of entirely new characters. The aforementioned characters, Alois and Caude, lead off the new cast. Alois is a very spoiled rich noble, much like Ciel, but he has a poor disposition in comparison. Claude, his butler, is a very devoted butler who was contracted to Alois, much like Sebastian. Claude does wear glasses most of the time, just in case you cannot tell the difference between the two of them the first time he shows up.

This season does seem to be darker than the last, and seems to forgo the humor after the first few episodes. Normally, you would expect Ciel's servants to appear to deliver some humor, but they really do not show up all that much. The season is mostly about Ciel and his connection to Alois, as well as Sebastian and his rivalry with Claude. Included on this set are the 6 OVA episodes, which are usually very humorous in comparison to the regular episodes. The Ciel in Wonderland episodes are very cute, especially if you like Alice in Wonderland spoofs. The episode, The Making of Black Butler 2 is definitely the most hilarious episode of the entire series.

This set comes from Funimation, just like the previous season, which is good. It definitely shows that they put much effort into this set, maybe even more than the last season. This set includes all 12 episodes of the season as well as the 6 OVA episodes. There are a few special features like English commentary, textless songs, and previews for both seasons. If you like supernatural Victorian-era anime with dueling butlers, then you should check this series out.",1383609600,2,2497,4.681093394077449
8588877,5,B00D39UPUU,"This season is only 12 episodes long, but the 6 OVA episodes included help this release feel less lackluster. While season 2 isn't *as* strong as the first, it's still really great, and the new characters are pretty complex. In my honest opinion, I feel like the 2-part OVA Ciel in Wonderland makes this release worth the buy, but perhaps that's just because I'm a huge Alice in Wonderland fan. The other OVAs are good, too, despite the fact that they're basically fillers.

Season 2 itself is definitely a good watch. The main character opposite Ciel is the new boy Alois. He has become one of my favorite characters of all time, and his backstory is just as dark as you would expect. I like that there's a reason as to why he's so crazy and messed up, rather just being an edgy character for the heck of it. The other characters from his mansion are also pretty unique, and while Claude at first seems too similar to Sebastian, you soon find out just how different the characters are.

At the end of the day, I'm really sad that this main season only lasted 12 episodes, as the characters and story were good enough that they definitely could have added a lot more content without making it drag on. But, if you're a Black Butler fan, you absolutely need to own this.

Funimation is losing the rights to this season, so buy it before the end of June while you can! You will certainly regret not picking this season up!",1529539200,,1420,4.453846153846154
