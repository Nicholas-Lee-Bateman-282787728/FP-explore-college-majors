643511,5,6303405606,"This is a delightful performance of Verdi's only comic opera.  The direction is by Franco Zeffirelli as was the set design.  Given that the Met appears to be retiring the classic Zeffirelli sets, in the near future DVD may be the only place to see these wonderful creations.  I do not have the expertise to comment on the quality of the singing -- however all appeared to do a great job.  What stood out for me was the fantastic acting by Paul Plishka (Falstaff).  His facial expressions were amazing and captivating (and something that most people in the MET audience could not see).  The DVD quality is wonderful -- the picture has clarity and excellent color saturation.  The camera work is very good -- there is none of the jerky cuts that clutter some other opera DVDs.  The sound is fine -- I always prefer DTS when it is available compared to PCM or Dolbey 5.1.  The DTS provides a reasonable but not fantastic sound stage.  On my first sitting I watched the last act at least four times.  This is a DVD I will be going back to watch.",1269475200,8,1041,4.426315789473684
643512,4,6303405606,"I've just watched this Falstaff for the first time. Big names cast, Met forces under Levine, classic Zeffirelli settings... I had great expectations.

Plishka's Falstaff is outstanding, both from the acting and singing point of view. It has everything required: the right age, attitude, voice and comedy doses. Freni's Alice and Horne's Quickly are also quite enjoyable, but they both lack something I would describe as ""agility"": there's some stiffness in their acting and singing, which is not present in Plishka nor Susan Graham's Meg Page, a small role perfectly rendered.  My Top-One lady in this production is Barbara Bonney, just wonderful as Nannetta. Her ""Sul fil d'un soffio etesio"" is absolutely magic, though the white horse she rides while singing the aria's first part seems to disagree (oh, these regisseurs!...). Frank Lopardo is very good as Fenton, though his voice is a little too spinto for the role, anyway the result is quite pleasing.  Bruno Pola seems not at ease with Ford, his emission looses perfection here and there, but all in all, he delivers a solid performance. From the Bardolf-Pistol-Caius trio I pick veteran Piero di Palma (Dr. Caius), for his musical, smooth tone and perfect diction, which old timers like me recognize in so many opera recordings from the 50's and on. The guy set a standard. Levine conducts with his renowned masterful Verdi expertise.

The sound is very good, and balance between stage and  pit is well done, not an easy task in this highly complex score. I believe 4:3 image quality isn't  up to 1993 standard, and this is a disappointing first impression, but you should soon forget it and get captivated by the performance. There's no interesting bonus material, and we have subtitles in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish (very good), and Chinese. My first impression: four stars and a half.",1256601600,10,1860,5.042345276872964
643513,5,6303405606,"It is to composer and librettist Arrigo Boito and his constant pestering of the octogenarian Verdi that there remained within him one last great comedy fighting to get out that we owe this absolute miracle of an opera. Produced in 1893 as Verdi turned 80 there is much in this masterpiece that can be identified as a modernist neoclassical work. The use of short motifs instead of long arioso melodic lines, the spry and reduced orchestral textures and the lack of a single 'stand and deliver' dramatic declamatory aria all serve to make this more of a 20th century work than an example of 19th century late-Romanticism. Despite his many years of writing for the stage Verdi refuses to give in to either age or time. There is an eternally youthful freshness to this score that is often breathtaking, culminating in the celestial final scene in Windsor Park. Like the enchanted Forest of Arden in As You Like It, we are in a world of nocturnal magic and human redemption that an Ovidian Verdi transforms into a wondrous fugue proclaiming that all the world's a joke. Any successful production of Falstaff must celebrate this magic.

This new DVD release of a performance filmed in October 1992 features Franco Zeffirelli's venerable 1964 production, his first appearance at the Met. Although it occasionally shows its age it is strong enough to overcome some minor shortcomings. Visually stunning in depicting Tudor era Windsor, there is something deeply satisfying in the way the singers interact with their surroundings. Each performance has a calm organic rightness at its core that transcends the frenetic pace of the opera, giving this Falstaff a sense of balance that always remains sure-handed. Paul Plishka is a wonderfully affecting Falstaff, comic yet vulnerable. Mirella Freni is superb as Alice Ford. Barbara Bonney as Nannetta and Marilyn Horne as Mrs. Quickly are excellent. The cast submerge themselves in their roles.

James Levine's conducting of this difficult score approaches perfection. In many ways his vision of the opera is reminiscent of von Karajan's brilliant EMI recording from the 1950s. The Met orchestra are at their early 1990's performance peak. DGG have cleaned up the nearly two decade old video, which is slightly fuzzy but clear. DTS and PCM sound are both excellent with DTS providing a nice sense of space and presence to the proceedings.

There are several fine DVDs of Falstaff now available. My favorite remains the magical and revelatory Solti conducted Falstaff featuring the Vienna Philharmonic from a few years back, also on DGG (DVD 073 4080). But this production gives that one a run for its money. In an ideal world one would own both. This opera exhausts superlatives and fairly cries for a multitude of different interpreters.

643514,5,6303405606,"I was not around for this production of Zeffirelli's Met Debut in 1964...but fortunately I was a Met Subscriber by 1992 when this was revised and had it on one of my subscription evenings.  When I watched this DVD, all the great memories of the production came back to me.  Levine conducted a GREAT CAST (Plishka, Freni, Horne, Bonney, Graham, Pola and Lopardo.  Two of the Met's great comprimarios, De Palma and Laciura also make this a perfect ""Falstaff"".
It is a beautiful no-nonsense staging with all the color, emotion and humor which Verdi intended.  Simply, it is fun to watch and everyone on stage is having fun presenting it.
When I saw on the DG web-site that it was going to be released, I checked amazon.com for its availability and noticed the release date of June 30, 2009.  I couldn't wait until then...lol.  So I went into the Amazon.canada site and it was there....so I purchased it from Canada.  Not a great price difference and the shipping was wonderful.
This is a Met performance which you must add to your collection.  DG always outdoes itself.  Video and audio was fantastic.",1244505600,30,1098,4.706806282722513
643515,5,6303405606,"This Met video conveys all the joyous spirit of Verdi's final opera. The sumptuous Elizabethan sets and costumes of the Franco Zeffirelli production are beautiful. The cast works together as a spirited ensmble, helped along by frequent visual jokes and lively stage business. Paul Plishka is not my first choice for the role of Falstaff: Falstaff is a baritone role, and Plishka is really a bass. But his grizzled voice, though not the most polished or mellifluous instrument, certainly conveys the character of the rascally old knight, and he acts the part wonderfully. The only weak member in the rest of the cast, in my mind, is Bruno Pola as Ford: his timber is rather unattractive and his acting skills are not on the level of the rest of the cast. James Levine leads the Met opera orchestra in a spirited reading of Verdi's subtle, quicksilver score.",1090886400,4,856,4.829931972789115
7846583,5,6303405606,"Oh, so much better than the BBC set with Terfel.  I like the more original sets and lightheartedness. All roles played by the best of their generation, Marilyn Horne is a hoot.",1479168000,,176,4.5
7846584,5,6303405606,"This is a fantastic production of Verdi's chefs-d'oeuvre, Falstaff. Timing is of the upmost importance in this opera, and Maestro Levine shows the leadership that he is known for to make all of the elements come together as a comic whole. The orchestra is great and the acting as a whole is very good. Paul Plishka perfectly captures Sir John Falstaff in all of his complexity; his narcissism and gluttony as well as his wittiness and humor. Despite all of his flaws, I view Falstaff as an almost overwhelmingly charming as wells as a tragic figure, both in Shakespeare and in Verdi. Plishka plays the part beautifully--and with such a voice! Mirella Freni, Bruno Pola, and Barbara Bonney do very well in their supporting roles. The staging can be considered traditional, definitely a plus in an age where it seems that most opera directors have lost their minds (or perhaps just have a deep hatred for the opera going public).  As with most Met videos, the camera work is fine and the video and sound quality are very good for an early 1990's recording.

Verdi had a great love of Shakespeare and it is said that Falstaff was the work that he was most proud of. When he finished composing the opera, the octogenarian Verdi felt a great sadness that his work with Sir John was through. Thanks to all involved in this production, Verdi's beloved Falstaff will live on in a way Verdi would approve for generations to come in this top-notch production.",1442016000,3,1449,4.700787401574803

7846587,5,6303405606,The main actor carried this opera from beginning to end. In my opinion he carried Verdi's intent of the character and did it well. I have seen him in Turandot in which he played an opposite kind of person. The supporting cast did an excellent job of supporting his role.,1389744000,,270,4.42

7846589,5,6303405606,"First, the cast. Second, the cast. Third, the cast. Couldn't have asked for more . . . and it's the Met, after all, with James Levine. Made in the 1990s, it places ""newish"" voices with seasoned performers. Very nice production values, plus a good booklet, to boot.",1376092800,,264,4.638297872340425
7846590,5,6303405606,"Largely considered by astute critics and opera-attending crowds alike to be one of Verdi's greatest works, Falstaff is simultaneously breathtaking and energy-inspiring. Having been composed at the end of this legendary operatic composer's life, Falstaff is a musical rendering of infinite creativity and progressivism. Unlike it's operatic predecessors, Falstaff abolished the recititive-aria compositional formation and instituted an entirely new, fast-paced set of rules for operatic progression. In perfect association with the intrinsic nature of the score, Zefferelli's production is concurrently striking in it's production and costuming and incessant in it's forward motion.

However, the success of this production is due most immediately to the performers. After all, when employing names like Mirella Freni, Marilyn Horne, and Paul Plishka, an astute performance is all but inevitable. Paul Plishka plays the title character Falstaff, the pontificating and rotund knight. His rounded baritone voice is perfectly complemented by his rollicking character portrayal. Mirella Freni and Susan Graham perform the roles of Mistress Ford and Page, respectively. Though characterized by a full-toned soprano voice, Freni occasionally lacks a certain connection to the performance. Alternatively, Graham is astute and engaging as an actress, but lacks the volume and depth in voice that the other characters display. Marilyn Horne is rich and full-voiced as ever and portrays a delightful, if somewhat affected, Mistress Quickley. Pola, Lopardo, and Bonney play their roles excellently. All in all, this is a fantastic recording and should be enjoyed and experienced frequently.",1329350400,3,1678,5.962655601659751
7846591,3,6303405606,"I had never heard this opera from Verdi and so I ordered it out of curiosity.  I absolutely love La Traviata which has one outstanding aria after another.  Even the ""connecting"" music between arias is beautiful.  Falstaff is nothing like that kind of opera.  There was not a single beautiful aria and the whole thing seemed rather trivial.  The story is of an obese self-absorbed jerk who tries to seduce other men's wives. Yuck!  It's just a different kind of opera.  It is more of a farce instead of La Traviata which has both a deeply moving story as well as incredible music.  I don't feel any need to see it again.",1301443200,,619,4.464285714285714
7846592,3,6303405606,"I only ordered Falstaff since someone told me to fill in my growing DVD opera library. In agreement with everyone the performance, voices, staging, orchestra were all five star. But at the end I asked myself, compared to all my other operas 1) did I enjoy myself, 2) was the music and arias memorable? In both cases I would say NO. I need to watch it again in a couple of months. In my library of about 30 operas this is my least memorable and favorite opera.",1300060800,,459,4.287356321839081
