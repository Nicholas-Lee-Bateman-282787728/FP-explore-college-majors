8523061,5,B007Y56IK0,"Another unique, fantastic Korean thriller. This is a very long, creepy and sinister film - about 2 and a half hours. But it is never boring. And it is worth the payoff. The plot - a strange man who has repented from his sins seems to attract the village locals who fund him for his teachings. A police officer is influenced by a local priest who is jealous that all his donations are going to this strange man. But after a strange twist, the police officer is convinced that the strange man is the genuine article he seems to be. But after the man passes away under mysterious circumstances, his loser son is notified about the man's death. And while attending to his father's affairs, he can't help but notice that the village elders can't wait to try to push him out and back to the city as quickly as possible. But the son decides to stay on and continues to discover the strange workings of the town and his father's past... Riveting. Great acting. Very tense. Not a horror film but certainly chilling in every way, including the human interest side. They don't make them like this in Hollywood.",1476835200,,1099,4.5
8523062,3,B007Y56IK0,"In this South Korean mystery thriller, a young Korean man receives a call that his father - leader of a small village whom he'd become estranged from years ago - has died. Visiting the village, the son quickly becomes aware that not only do mysterious circumstances surround his father's death ... but that the quirky and somewhat menacing villagers in no way want him to stick around anywhere long enough to discover the truth. A long film (over 2-1/2 hours), with some nice twists and turns, and although never truly scary the atmosphere is creepy and sinister up until the end (where one final surprise awaits, literally within the last few seconds of the film). Nicely done!",1356998400,,678,4.803418803418803
8523063,5,B007Y56IK0,"Moss is a mystery/thriller from South Korea. A young man is called into a small village to settle the estate of his dead father. He gets suspicious of the villagers as they quickly and anxiously try to push him to leave as soon as possible. When he decides to stay, he uncovers the dark truth...

Although it is a very long film (over 2hr and 40 min), it kept me entertained and captivated through its immersive dialogue. I don't watch mystery films often, but this one kept me guessing until the end. It's not a complete mystery film though, it also has some dreadful suspense and thrills; he's often snooping around and you can't help but grip your seat or clench your fist as you fear for his safety. I really liked the way the film moves forward as he moves deeper and deeper into the mystery; the main villain has several henchmen and they help push the movie forward with some thrills/action. You really wonder: who killed his father? (whodunit?) Also, the whole mystery is effectively complimented by the atmospheric village setting. And the twist ending might even throw you off. It's a beautifully shot film, great direction, amazing acting (Jeong Jae-yeong did a great job as the evil village leader), and I enjoyed the music. Just remember, this film works mostly off its dialogue so be prepared since its very long.

Overall, I highly recommend Moss. It's a long film, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. South Korea delivers a dark, twisted thriller-mystery once again; I look forward to finding more of these gems. As of 8/9/12, Moss is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also highly recommend.

Moss has blood and violence, and sex.",1344470400,4,1655,4.739583333333333
