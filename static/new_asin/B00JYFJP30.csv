6397206,4,B00JYFJP30,"""Antboy""
(Cinedigm, 2014)
. . . .

A Danish parody of ""Spider-Man""-style superhero stories, this kid-friendly PG-rated feature film tells the story of Pelle Norman, a shy, innocent tweenage nebbish who accidentally gains, well, ant powers after being bitten by a scientifically mutated ant. In addition to the familiar origin story, the purposefully silly plot shares other elements common to modern super-movies, such as a backdrop of corporate malfeasance and a maniacal scientific genius with a grudge against humanity. The low-budget film may be a hard sell for American audiences due to the sometimes-iffy English-language dubbing (ala ""Let the Right One In"").  I would have preferred seeing the original Danish dialog with English subtitles, or at least having that as an option on this disc, but I guess subtitles can be a big expense for indie foreign titles, so that's just a current hazard of the marketplace.

The film is also slowly paced and predictable (due in part to its intentional satirization of superhero cliches) though the underlying sense of humor is appealing, and while the special effects are (charmingly) low-rent, some of the production design is nice, particularly the costumes. The story ends on an open note, and I have to confess that while this film didn't blow me away, the possibility of a sequel or ongoing series sounds nice. ""Antboy II"" has already been made in Denmark, although I'd imagine even more likely for American audiences will be a high-tech remake with a bigger budget and more convoluted script -- if so, let's hope they can find a kid to play Antboy who's as charming as Danish actor Oscar Dietz. A charming, though not great, definitely kid-friendly film. (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1405987200,4,1764,5.139372822299651

6397212,5,B00JYFJP30,We watched this tonight on netflix and my 7 year old boy and 10 year old daughter loved it. We are looking forward to watching the next one tomorrow night. The movie is Danish but the american voices are dubbed in pretty nicely. In fact it is hard to figure out which country it is because most of it looks like the U.S. The gym teacher reminds me of the cousin from Napoleon Dynamite.,1444348800,,385,4.216216216216216

6397217,2,B00JYFJP30,"I watched this with kids between 10 and 13 and we were bored almost the whole time. Granted it's not an American film, so the pacing and dialogue rhythm is different, but even so, the acting is universally  unnatural. There are no plot twists, the bad guy us simply ridiculous and the special effects are bland.",1436918400,,311,4.553571428571429
6397218,1,B00JYFJP30,"The posted information omits one fact that was crucial for me: the dvd lacks the original Norwegian dialog. If you are looking for a dubbed parody of Spiderman, then enjoy. If you are looking for a dvd of the original, then keep looking.",1436745600,,237,4.534883720930233
6397219,4,B00JYFJP30,"My 7-year-old and I enjoyed this so much we've rented again. (My 16-year-old did not, however!)
This is a subtitled foreign film, clearly made on a low budget. This is clearly not a Hollywood production created for a demanding American audience. It is a hero vs. evil story that young kids can enjoy.",1433030400,,300,4.679245283018868
6397220,4,B00JYFJP30,"This was simply a fun movie.  There are a lot of ""throw away"" movies made for kids in the US.  Movies that not only do not suspend disbelief, but place disbelief front and center through dreadful writing and ""1 take"" directing.

This is not one of those films.  Certainly it is designed for kids and told from a kid's perspective, but it has a fresh perspective that makes it worth watching.  This is a foreign film (that has been dubbed in English), so I suspect that part of the fresh perspective comes from simply not being made using the same ""cookie cutter"" employed by US movies.

So in summary, the dubbing is quite good, the movie shows the life of an unlikely boy-turned-superhero from a fairly fresh perspective.  Antboy succeeds because of teamwork (a lesson that all super-hero wannabes should learn) and highlights some of the unexpected problems of being an all too human super-hero.  It is not a blockbuster; it's just a fun movie.",1428969600,,946,4.6909090909090905

6397222,5,B00JYFJP30,"Great family movie. Squeaky clean and fun. We enjoyed it as much as our daughters (8 and 10). The evil villain, the Flea, needs blood for his powers, so that could be a little gross for younger kids,  but it's talked about only; it's never explained where the blood comes from. Comedic violence (only a few scenes), no bad language (one use of ""damn""), no weapons, no sex.",1421452800,2,372,4.470588235294118

6397224,5,B00JYFJP30,"this is a awesome movie. I thought this was one of those independent films just made for dvd. I did not realize this was a foreign film from Denmark and that it was a popular movie down there. I did not even know that antboy was a popular Denmark superhero. and I'm glad that they shared it with us. I didn't even know that it hit independent theaters here in the us. this is a good movie. great story, good acting and good special effects I hope they release antboy 2 here in the usa soon. I have not seen to many foreign films and this one is pretty good. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do. i would also say that this movie is underated",1420675200,,660,4.0458015267175576
6397225,3,B00JYFJP30,"I am writing this review for our children. Our children enjoyed this movie and even begin acting themselves. Our children feel this movie could have been better. They feel that it should have been a kid flea instead of an adult flea for the bad guy and I totally agree with our children. Our children also said the movie has the worst acting they have ever seen.

I asked our children if they liked this movie and what they rated this movie as. Our children give this movie a three. We have movie night and game night one night or day out of the week (after homework has been completed, mostly on Friday or Saturday) so we are always looking for a good movie or game.

We are glad this movie came on Netflix, our children range in ages from eight months to 14 years of age and I am a mom of more than five children.

Enjoy, the movie it is good clean family fun.",1418601600,,862,4.180722891566265

8654587,5,B00JYFJP30,"The fight sequence at 64:27 was quite simply the best cinematography I have ever witnessed. My adult siblings and I had to watch the BREATHTAKING visual display multiple times for full effect. These child actors were phenomenal and it was a joy to watch them grow over three films. The third film had a great love story with a romantic twist. This was such a fresh take on superhero movies, with unique stories, characters, and special powers. I highly recommend these films, and personally will be watching them annually, on our hallowed celebration of Antboy Party.

8654588,4,B00JYFJP30,"This is actually a pretty good film.

First, it is family safe.  The parents and grown-ups are shown as good, honest folk that love their children.

Second, bad people are bad.  There is no gray in this movie.

Third, like the original versions of the fairy tales no hero and no person is 100% perfect.  Antboy has his flaws, but with the help of his friends he overcomes his limitations.

There are very few special effects, but the ones that are use are well done.

The movie is dubbed.  So be aware that while the lip sync is very good, it is not perfect.

(But, it never falls the level of Kukla, Fran, and Ollie, or Hong Kong Kung Fu fest!)

My other main concern was this was just derivative of every other superhero movie out there, but this one is different.  It truly does approach this from the kids' perspectives.

Well done!",1531612800,2,836,4.38562091503268
8654589,5,B00JYFJP30,"Ok... I'm not a huge fan of this movie. It's cheesy. The English dubs aren't very good. But my 2 year old loves... LOVES... this movie. He will cry for Antboy until we put it on. I'm looking forward to him growing out of it, but I have to give it a great review. It really is a fun movie and young kids will probably like it greatly.",1519862400,,333,3.911764705882353
8654590,5,B00JYFJP30,Very Disney movie with a super-hero who is not only powerful...but pisses acid to break locks as well as melt-down toilets! Wonderful break for the kids and adults. Thank you!,1509494400,,175,4.866666666666666
8654591,5,B00JYFJP30,My 8 year old grandson loved this movie.  It was so nice to see a movie that doesn't have foul language or content not appropriate for families.  Thanks so much for that.  We rented Antboy 2 also.,1508716800,,196,4.243243243243243
8654592,2,B00JYFJP30,"12-year-old Pelle (Oscar Dietz) is bitten by a malevolent ant (you could see the look on the ants face at the time of the incident.)

Naturally he gains super powers such as sticky fingers. What is he to do?
Aided by a friend, who enamored of supper powered beings, Antboy gains an identity and a costume (with a cloak.)

He goes through all the psychological problems one an ant isapate.

Does he learn the value of friends or will he be the object of biting humor?
