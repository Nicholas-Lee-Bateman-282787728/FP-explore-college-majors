8739004,5,B002ZAZ7Z6,"This video (I think it's the 10th in the series) is over-the-top wacky hilarity and action-packed, to boot. Agent Emes must find out why Jewish children are falling sick all over Shpittsburgh and how it relates to the missing sofer. My favorite part are the wonderful performances playing by the girls playing Chani and Devoiry. SO cute and spunky.",1314835200,,348,4.915254237288136
8739005,5,B002ZAZ7Z6,"Our entire family of all ages from grandparents to kids loved this show! It's well-plotted, well-acted, fast-paced fun with a life lesson stirred in for good measure. (Our youngest did figure out the ending, but none of the rest of us could.) In fact, we're fans of the entire Agent Emes series, with Grandma waiting most eagerly of all at the mailbox for the arrival of each new DVD.",1265587200,,384,4.579710144927536
