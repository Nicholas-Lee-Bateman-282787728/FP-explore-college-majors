597061,5,6303184154,"Pp, a notorious gangster from Paris, has been forced to seek refuge in the maze of Casbah where he evades the police's futile attempts to capture him.  During the police force's attempts to find a way to capture him,  the mobster Pp continues to raid jewelry stores and steal whatever he can get his hands on, and when he is not on a robbery he spends his time with his lover, Ins, or plays card.  However, one night when Pp is dodging the police's hopeless attempts to catch him, he crosses paths with Gaby Gould, a stunning Parisian woman.  This encounter opens up Pandora's Box for Pp and he falls in love with Gaby who reminds him of ultimate freedom.  The score played in the film intensifies the perplexity of Pp's situation that is further improved through cinematography, which produces a sense of entrapment.  In addition, the mis-en-scene and acting is of world class.  In end, Pp Le Moko offers a spellbinding story, which at the end deliberately forces the audience to ponder the film's fundamental message.",1050796800,7,1019,4.72316384180791

In 1938 Hollywood remade it as Algiers, but kept the original off-limits. Jean Gabin, in a truly iconic performance, is the titular notorious and elegant master thief who is safe as long as he stays in the Casbah.

597063,5,6303184154,"For those who are familiar with the sort of film Hollywood had to offer during its ""Golden Age"", it is a revelation to see French productions of the same period. They are completely different in every respect. Fresh, inventive, bitingly witty or hopelessly romantic, the classic French film creates a sort of  visual and narrative poetry that is both an essential part of its realism, and transcends reality to create a different sort of world, rich in heightened emotion.
Films such as Marcel Carne's ""Quai des Brumes"", and ""Le Jour Se Leve"" offer definitive examples of the French poetic realist school with its appealingly romantic drifters (often played by Gabin), sad and worldly women (the likes of Michele Morgan and Arletty), its doomed romances, and shadowy mise en scene. Yet even amongst such undisputed classics as these, Pepe le Moko stands out as something special from its opening shots of the Casbah to its tragic conclusion.
It is particularly fortuitous that we should be able to compare this film to its vastly inferior American remake, Algiers (1938). All that Algiers lacks can be aptly summed up in one word: Gabin. For it is Gabin that makes ""Pepe"" what it/he is. It is impossible not to feel your heart beat a little quicker at his entrances and exits, and he electrifies the screen at the merest flicker of an eyelid. The film without him (Algiers) betrays the essential silliness of the central plot conceit and charming  Charles Boyer does not have the force of personality to smooth out plot weaknesses.  In Pepe le Moko one can see the best example to be had of the iconic Gabin role, and in the merging of star and character find something special and riveting.
Criterion has done a magnificent job with this release! The picture is no less than exquisite and the extras are, as always,  both highly useful and wonderfully entertaining ( the director interview with M. Duvivier is certainly a highlight!) Those who are true Pepe-philes take note: the transfer here is so good that it is possible to note that during the tour de force scene in which Pepe mourns the loss of his ""mome"" Pierrot, Gabin wears his own shirt, identified by the monogram JG on the breast pocket.
I highly reccommend this release. Criterion has distinguished itself once again!",1043884800,2,2282,4.843589743589743
597064,5,6303184154,"Many thanks to Criterion for releasing this wonderful restoration of Pepe le Moko.  This film was impossible to find on dvd prior to this release, and Criterion has gone to great lengths to do a complete presentation.
The film itself looks wonderful.  There's still some slight aging, etc, but most of these were retained on purpose.  In addition to the film, this disc includes some great supplements including the history of ""Pepe"" and a direct comparison between Pepe le Moko and the English language remake the next year, Algiers.
I had seen Algiers many times prior to seeing Pepe.  I loved Charles Boyer but if you have a chance to see both films I think you will agree that Pepe le moko is by far supperior.  Jean Gabin's screen presence to an extent that Boyer doesn't quite match.  In addition, the romance in Pepe has real sparks and chemistry.  This is simply a wonderful film, and this dvd edition is excellent.
Thank you Criterion.",1043625600,9,944,4.719512195121951
597065,5,6303184154,"This film reached almost legendary status in the US because Hollywood remade it as ALGIERS & kept the original from being shown. Pauline Kael called it 'superb entertainment' & Graham Greene thought it was considerably more. Who am I to disagree? This movie is a perfect demonstration of why women all over the world fell in love with mugs like Gabin & Bogart & why little boys wanted to grow up and be them. The plot couldn't be simplier. A master thief is safe from the police as long as he stays within the confines of the Casbah. A bulldog police inspector is determined to lure him out. Enter the bored mistress of a wealthy Frenchman to complete the triangle. But what drives the story is not plot but character. All the elements: direction, writting, acting, lighting, editing etc. are all of a piece & eliminating one seriously alters the whole. In one memorable scene Pepe & the woman gaze into each other's eyes while reciting stops on the Paris Metro simultaneously reaching the same destination from opposite ends.

597136,3,6303184154,"""Pepe Le Moko"" is a 1937 French film remade in 1938 as ""Algiers"" starring Charles Boyer, Hedy Lemarr, and Joseph Calleia, with Alan Hale Sr., Stanley Fields, and Gene Lockhart.

""Algiers was directed by John Cromwell ( ""Tom Sawyer"", ""Of Human Bondage"", ""The Prisoner of Zenda"", ""The Adventures of Marco Polo"" ), produced by Walter Wagner  (""Queen Christina"", ""The Bitter tea of General Yen"", ""Cocoanuts"",  ""Scarlet Street""), and beautifully photographed by James Wong Howe, one of Hollywood's best cameramen. The film was nominated for 4 Oscars (Actor, Supporting Actor, Art Direction, Cinematography) and came in at #10 in the box office. It was the inspiration for ""Casablanca"" (1942).

""Pepe Le Moko"" is virtually the same film with the same set of characters and only some minor variations. Thus, the comparison is relatively easy and starts with the lead actors - Charles Boyer and Jean Gabin.

Jean Gabin (1904-76) was not only a film star but also a war hero. His film career in the US was not successful, but in Europe he was a major star, winning 2 Berlin International Film Festival awards, 2 Venice Film festival awards, and 2 BAFTA nominations.

Charles Boyer (1899-1978) was everyone's favorite Frenchman. He was nominated for an Oscar 4 times, beginning in 1937 (""Conquest"") and ending in 1961 (""Fanny""). His most famous film is ""Gaslight"" (1944) although his performance in ""Algiers""  is often mentioned as one of his career highlights.

Gabin plays le Moko as a refined thug, while Boyer's portrayal is much more suave. For a famed jewel thief, suave seems more believable, since the thief has to mix with high society.

Since Boyer was 39 when he played le Moko, and Gabin was only 33, there is a much more world weary tint to Boyer's performance, which seems to fit the story better.

So my preference is for Boyer.

Mireille Balin (1909-68) was one of France's most beautiful and glamorous pre war actresses, best known for her work in this film and ""Lady Killer"" (1937).

Hedy Lemarr (1913-2000) was equally as beautiful, although she had a longer liufe as an actress - a 20 year career that included films like ""White Cargo"" (1942), ""Tortilla Flat"" (1942), and ""Samson and Delilah"" (1949).

The bow goes to Lamarr for her acting prowess.

The Algerian police inspector is played by Lucas Gridoux (1896-1952) who manages to impart the same intensity and desparation we see in Joseph Calleia's performance in the US version. He even seems to be more venal, which is better suited to the role. Calleia seems to have a little too much conscience for the role he is playing.

The bow goes to Gridoux.

The action in both films is handled very well and neither one drags. But ""Pepe"" uses far too many close-ups for my taste, especially when the close-ups don't serve the plot. Another problem I have with the French version is the sound track which is very light on music. As well, the occasional gun shots seem far too artificial and the attempt at deep focus photography results in several scenes being out of focus.

Technicals go to the US version.

Bottom line - ""Pepe le Moko"" is a good film, but the remake ""Algiers"" is one of the best films of the 30s and possibly one of the best films of all time.",1313884800,3,3222,4.774774774774775
597137,5,6303184154,"""Pepe le Moko,"" (1936) is a classic French film, a black and white crime/drama/romance, and an early film noir, made before the concept was even codified, by the French, of course.  It was based on a novel by Henri La Barthe, writing under the nom de plume of ""Ashelbe,"" which is simply the author's initials: he also did the screen play.  Julien Duvivier directed.  It concerns the notorious Pepe le Moko, Parisian gangster, on the lam after pulling off a big Marseilles bank job in which there were casualties.  He's a wanted man, and he must cool his heels in the labyrinthine Casbah of Algiers, in what was then the French colony of Algeria, in Northern Africa.  Within the Casbah, the native quarter, he is beloved, extremely popular with the women, and safe from the police, who, however, never stop scheming as to how they may yet net him.  And then he meets and falls for Gaby Gould, a gorgeous Parisienne, and leaves the Casbah for her.  It is his undoing.

The magnetic young French actor Jean Gabin, who was born in Montmartre, Paris, embodied the title role magnificently: he had the presence, the chops and the charisma to make it his.  Mireille Balin played the beauteous adventuress.  Gilbert Gil plays Pierrot; the well-known theatrical star Marcel Dalio, who played Gabin's friend in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Illusion-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780020707/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Illusion - Criterion Collection</a>, and the croupier in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/B002VWNIAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>, plays L'Arbi.  The film was made at the height of French interest in its colonies: it is exotic, moody, atmospheric as all get-out and gives us a great sense of the sun washed, multi-ethnic, menacing city. Black and white photography has seldom been used to better purpose: you can just about feel the heat.

It has been said that if ""Pepe le Moko"" had never been written, it would have had to have been written as a vehicle for Gabin, and I believe it.  Later in his life, he had great success as Simenon's  detective Maigret, but he's more than a little rough around the edges, and makes an entirely convincing gangster; he played many.  It has also been said that if ""Pepe le Moko"" had never been made, the tremendously popular, Oscar-winning ""Casablanca"" would never have been made, and I believe that too.  ""Casablanca"" borrows the sense of the atmospheric, mysterious, menacing northern African city, jammed with many different ethnic groups, in its entirety.

Between ""Pepe"" and ""Casablanca,"" there was, of course, a third film, the 1938 Hollywood remake of ""Pepe,"" called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Algiers/dp/B00006II5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Algiers</a>. It starred the very beautiful Hedy Lamarr as the adventuress, in which role she does quite well, her beauty sure helped; and Charles Boyer in the Pepe role.  Boyer was, of course, a very handsome Frenchman, but he quite lacked the sheer working class presence that Gabin brought to the role, and cannot, actually, carry the picture as Gabin did.  Walter Wanger produced the American copy; it is said that he tried to destroy all copies of the French original, which, luckily for us he was not able to do.  To compare the two versions of the story is certainly instructive.  It is said that actors were hired for the American copy based upon their resemblance to the French originators of the roles, and that Wanger had a Movieola running at all times in the studio as he was filming, making virtually scene for scene copies of the original.  You can, in fact, see that the backgrounds are frequently identical, the lighting just the same, the placement of the actors just the same, and the actors strongly resemble those in ""Pepe.""  There is, of course, something to be said for ""Algiers,"" even so, but you owe it to yourself to see the original.",1277942400,3,4022,5.389776357827476
597138,5,6303184154,"Normally I wouldn't bother reviewing a classic that has a ton of five star votes, but somebody actually claimed this film was only worthy of two stars, so here's another vote to boost it back to a full five if possible!

I saw the 1937 French film ""Pepe Le Moko"" long after I, like so many other American film goers, had grown used to the story in the Charles Boyer/Hedy Lamarr domestic version, ""Algiers"" (Why not ""The Casbah""? I always wondered?) The 1938 Hollywood remake is a highly perfumed and most attractive feature, with Boyer too pretty for a gangster but still excellent with a most engaging suavity - no problem understanding why all the women are attracted to him, and Hedy at the very beginning of her American career simply a pure vision. The camerwork by Howe is excellent to sometimes special and earned him his first Oscar Nomination, the story is told very well, and all in all a most charming and attractive film, that in some ways is fairly described as a classic. But...

But the original is a horse of a very different color - or black and white - and I can only suggest its astonishing power, the grip it takes on a viewer, the hold of its atmosphere. Here is something far more realistic and gritty than its softer Hollywood variation: A world of unattractive low lifes and disreputables, illicit drugs and deceit and ugliness, and playing out to a final rotten betrayal operating with the immediacy of a splash of absinthe in the face. How relentlessly the story develops: death occurs in the most brutal and unforgiving fashion, whether morally deserved as a breaking of the criminal code, or simply fated, the two quickly lose any distinction.

Gabin as Pepe the gangster on the lam gives as monumental a portrait as anything of the time - equal to the very best of any actor. His tragedy, his destructive obsession with a woman who comes to represent a freedom he can never know, turns him against the counsels and pleas of his wiser self, and his dearest friends. In his madness to find freedom and escape Pepe can no longer live within himself and his hideout, the Casbah. Desperate, trapped rather than saved, his fragmented milieu turns claustrophobic, his once safe streets now mock. The rooftops above blaze under the full power of Mediterranean sunshine, more brightly captured and caught than it has ever before been captured on film, producing a violent stageset conceived around endless constraining reflective walls within the Casbah's ever-changing labrinth.

Criterion captures this with a fabulous transfer - although slightly higher in cost than most DVDs the finished product does full justice to this magnificent film.",1255478400,5,2664,4.8355263157894735

597140,5,6303184154,"This trademark role, along with ""Grand Illusion"", contributes to French actor Gabin's legacy what ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"" did for Bogart. Duvivier's dark film is one our most atmospheric mysteries, exuding an almost paranoic tension. Gabin (like younger countryman Gerard Depardieu), is not classically handsome, but possessed of a rugged allure that women find unable to resist. At the same time, Balin is pretty irresistible herself, definitely a woman worth taking chances for. See Gabin's charisma at its height in the incomparable ""Pepe"".",1182729600,,557,5.642857142857143
597141,5,6303184154,"This film set the standard for French noir as far as I'm concerned. It kick started J. Gabin's career and for a great reason; the man exudes cool and style. It's no wonder the film was remade right away, then again later on. It's a classic tragedy wrapped in lush old black and white film stylings including a larger than life anti-hero and a double cross. If you don't like subtitles, then stick to your Hollywood classics, but you'd miss out on a real treat. I own over 400 films and praise it in my top ten favs.",1181260800,,515,4.26530612244898
597142,5,6303184154,"""Pepe Le Moko"" (1937) directed by Julien Duvivier - is a wonderful movie with the great performance from very young Jean Gabin. It just happened that I've seen several movies with him in the older age where he is serious, not very talkative man with the head full of grey hair and I like him in the later movies, too but it was so much fun to see him as Pepe - young, charming, dangerous, smart, brutal, irresistible, and so much in love with Paris that he'd lost forever. As much as I enjoyed the film as an early noir and crime, I think it is about the longing for home, about the nostalgia and as such it is even more interesting, deeper, poignant that just a noir. The celebrated film director Max Ophls, who knew a lot about nostalgia and immigration said about Paris,

""It offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights, breakfast in Monmartre with cognac in your glass, coffee and lukewarm brioche, gigolos and prostitutes at night. Everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and Paris.""

I could not help thinking of his words when I watched the film. There is one scene that almost reduced me to tears - a middle-aged former chanteuse plays one of her records on a gramophone and sings along with her voice that has not changed at all even if she looks nothing like the picture on the wall from the days of her youth. The time may play very nasty jokes with a woman - she may get fat or skinny, lose her teeth and hair but her voice will stay as strong or tender, ringing or melodious as it was in the long gone days that stay forever in her memory. She sings about Paris and there are tears on her eyes and the scene simply can't leave any viewer indifferent. There is another scene - between Pepe and Gaby the girl from Paris with whom Pepe falls in love (Mireille Balin). They talk about Paris remembering different places which are dear to both of them, and in the end, they both named La Place Blanche where they both belong and not in Algiers's Casbah where Pepe is safe and he rules the world of criminals but can't forget the sound of Metro in Paris. When Pepe wants to tell Gaby that he loves her, he tells her that she reminds him of Metro in Paris...

I have not even mentioned how masterfully the film was shot by Julien Duvivier and how well it was acted, how fast it movies, and there are so many wonderful scenes that I have not mentioned...Great, great movie.",1175040000,2,2404,4.349665924276169
597143,5,6303184154,"Pepe le Moko is one of those films that seems to actually improve each time I see it, and not just because it set the mold for every exotic doomed Hollywood romance from Casablanca on. Jean Gabin is at his best here, capturing both the legend and the vulnerability of his criminal king of the Casbah, `ruling' in hell but longing for the heaven beyond its gates. The atmosphere is wonderful, the script sublime, Duvivier's direction superb, and the film so filled with memorable moments that you can forgive the blandness of the leading lady (to be fair, the attraction is meant to be more the lure of the old life and places back home that Pepe once knew) and the over the top performance of Lucas Gridoux, overdoing the Uriah Heap routine as his nemesis Slimaine, potentially the film's most interesting character.

Criterion's DVD is among their very best, boasting a fine transfer and some excellent extras, from a 33-minute extract from documentary Remembering Jean Gabin to a comparison of the film and its first Hollywood remake, Algiers, as well as a 10-minute archive interview with Julien Duvivier, text extracts from Ginette Vincendeau's book on the film and the original French theatrical trailer.

597144,5,6303184154,"French film star Jean Gabin effuses sensuality in his portrayal of Parisian master thief ""Pepe Le Moko"" in the 1937 film of the same name.  Pepe has been sequestered in the Casbah of Algiers for two years, having evaded authorities.  The Casbah whose labrynthine mazes of narrow streets, alleyways and terraces and sympathetic populace provide a safe haven for Pepe and his gang.

The suave yet tough Gabin struts around in sartorial splendor a veritable king in this sheltered environment.  He fears the consequences of leaving the Casbah into the arms of police.  Local authorities, well aware of his wherabouts have been unable to ferret him out.

A chance encounter between Pepe and attractive Parisian socialite Gaby Gould played by Mireille Balin gives local Algerian police inspector Slimane played by Lucas Gridoux an idea.  Gabin is so smitten by the stylish, diamond bedecked Balin, that the inspector endeavors to lure Gabin out of the Casbah using her as bait.  The cool calculating Pepe has been hopelessly enraptured with Balin and against his better judgement, helplessly seeks her out beyond the confines of his comfortable asylum.

The filming done in large part in Algiers gives an excellent representation of the physical make up of the Casbah.  Director Duvivier successfully drives home the axiom that crime ultimately does not pay.",1131667200,4,1353,5.165137614678899
597145,2,6303184154,"I'm afraid that I was disappointed by this 1936 movie of French gangsters in the Casbah. I suppose this was a copy of American gangster movies, but Jean Gabin as a suddenly love sick hard guy willing to risk prison for a pretty face is not believable. In fact, none of the characters seemed realistic. They were almost cartoonish. Humphrey Bogart or James Cagney in their 1930's gangster movies were far more realistic and their films hold up better. Because Gabin's love for Juline Duvivier is not developed, we can not understand why Pepe would give up the sexy life he has in his exotic world. The best part of the movie is Pepe's walk to the harbor. The camera follows him from behind and from unusual angles and cuts. There is a Citizen Kane feeling in these shots. The gritty tear scene at the end is interesting also. Technically this movie is not up to American Gangster movies, but you can see the influence on Godard in the 50's.",1087344000,4,939,4.529411764705882

7841077,5,6303184154,"I saw this first at the National Gallery of Art in DC and loved it. Duvivier made many films, and made them well. In this film, the place is absolutely wonderful.  Although the film was made in 1937, Duvivier shot some fascinating angles of the Casbah, which created an exotic atmosphere that pervaded the film. The evocation of place included not only the complex architecture of the Casbah, but also the complex and varied society, which was well represented in the main characters, especially by Line Noro as Pepe's old girlfriend.  Lucas Gridoux as slimey Inspecteur Slimane contributed a wonderfully effective part in the network of people whom Pepe saw most often.

Black and white suits this film well, since it makes the Casbah look like a place that is no more, and never was part of the modern world.

Jean Gabin brings exactly the right elements to Pepe - rugged, tried, resourceful, and sometimes brutal, yet vulnerable - an Everyman who was no better than he could be, yet longed for a better life.

While some pre-war films have become dated, the romance of Pepe le Moko, and the beautiful evocation of the Casbah, will always be worth revisiting, even if it may one day end up in the huge junkpile that is the setting of Wall-E.",1343001600,2,1243,4.68348623853211

The image many times is doubled AND fuzzy for everything that is not dead in the center of the picture, as if watched through a high-distortion glass. I have never seen this before, maybe it is just my copy... 4.5 stars for the movie, 2.5 for the DVD",1336608000,,568,4.172727272727273
