8526375,5,B0089N7SLO,"I liked this film. Of course Tibet is an incredibly beautiful part of the world anyway, but I had no problem with the quality of the cinematography. It looked pretty new and fresh to me. Especially positive was the tone of the narrator: respectful, insightful, sympathetic. The appreciation of the people's deep immersion in an ancient, traditional, positive spirituality was very well conveyed. It's certainly much more than a travelogue; delivers the message of the title, that it's about the culture and the fundamental inner values propagated by Tibetan Buddhism; the scenes with the youthful acolytes were moving. All in all, encouraging to see that there still exists this Shangri-la, preserving its culture in the face of oppression from the outside world. A gentle place.",1379203200,2,779,5.24
