1418531,1,B00005ATQ6,"The premise is good, but the film is not.  The scene shifts are abrupt; the transitions, non-existent.  The acting?  Christiane Millet (Frial) shines in scenes that do not involve Gabriele Osburg (November).  Gabriele Osburg never shines.  She's just awful.  (Not surprisingly, Millet has made a number of films; Osburg, three.)  The women simply have no chemistry.  The characters they play are supposedly passionately in love with each other, but their attempts to portray and convey that passion are stilted and contrived.

A side note.  The quality of the DVD is terrible: it is quite literally VHS on a disc.",1183161600,4,613,5.101010101010101
1418532,5,B00005ATQ6,"I wish there were more movies like this one.  Opening in Alsace-Lorraine before the Second World War, we follow the struggles of two women, one of whom is Jewish, and their families as they resist the German occupation. As their love ever deepens in the face of horrible oppression, we learn not only how deception can be honorable but the price of loyalty. This is not a very explicit movie nor is the print in pristine shape but it is a wonderful story very unlike many of today, particularly in the way that others not only accepted but defended their love.",997574400,34,560,4.544554455445544

1418535,1,B00005ATQ6,"Based on the other reviews, I was expecting a really good film - with love, passion and an excellent storyline.  I must have missed something that others found in this flick.  Maybe it was intended to be deep and heavy rather than having a story or any passion.  After 30 minutes of total boredom, I tried skipping ahead a little at a time but it never seemed to improve.  The film quality was that of a colorized late 1940's foreign film with really bad audio.  The english subtitles went by so fast at times that I would have to pause the fim to read them before they vanished.  I have never rented a movie that was so slow and generally bad that I could not force myself to watch all the way through.
Again, some people must have seen things in the movie that went over my head, but to my there was no comparison to more contemporary films of the same genre.",1428710400,,861,4.251533742331288

1418539,5,B00005ATQ6,"The two women November and Ferial in this memorable movie fall in love and manage to struggle in their love in the throes of War. The sincerity, truth and emotions of each women is so appealing. This is a strong movie showing how love can get through any situation even if everything is against them, especially two women. I loved this complex and moving movie.",1424044800,2,361,4.569230769230769

1418542,5,B00005ATQ6,"I adore this movie so much that I watched it 3 times in 3 days so as not to miss anything at all.  The reason I love it so much is it's so engaging even though obviously I've never been in any situation even close to this but I feel drawn in completely to all the characters and the pain, suffering and joy they go through.  It is not contrived in any way and the relationship between the two women is outstanding to the degree that it makes you feel intensely.  The depth of their passion for each other builds through their shared experiences of the war and how how it affects them which comes through at all times as authentic  love therefore the scenes of brief intimacy between them is so moving and real that you don't have to be shown more, it hits deep in your core and you feel the longing for them to reunite safely forever.",1420070400,,834,4.19375

1418544,5,B00005ATQ6,"A suspenseful  movie which shows the true love between two women who are willing to risk their lives for each other.
Tender and traumatic scenes follow each other as it must have been, living during those times, during WWII and
under the Nazi occupation. An amazing movie with great acting and musical score; there is even a  musical theme
melody whenever the two women are together loving each other . An early important Gay film which must be seen, to be believed.",1419724800,3,466,4.670731707317073

1418551,3,B00005ATQ6,"""November Moon"" starkly reaffirms the notion that love does not conquer all, though it may fuel a survival instinct.  Billed as a Gay/Lesbian film, November Moon really is a movie about the atrocities of the Nazis, this time in France, during WWII.  The fact that two young lovers (November and Ferial) happen to be women is less relevant than the fact that one is a displaced German Jew and the other a French non-Jew.  Had the story been based on a French Christian man and a German Jewish woman, the same story line could have played out, with more plausibility. It is well written, well acted, and deeply wrenching.

I'd call this film a WWII Nazi Occupation movie, complete with scenes and/or implications of rape, torture, and other assorted depravities, but, ultimately, of survival, too.  Except for ending when Germany was defeated, there is no redemption in the film.  The French heroine is reviled for appearing to have consorted with the enemy when it is safe for the locals to express their rage at her (they cut off her hair, a mean, but far less barbaric activity than they've been exposed to by their Nazi overseers). But the lovers survive; at least they were still alive when the film ended.  There are tender moments portrayed, thankfully.  The intensity of the film would be unbearable without them, and they come not only from the lovers, but also from ordinary/extraordinary people who risked their own lives to help November survive by letting her hide and live with them.

German language, some French, with English subtitles.",1336780800,8,1550,4.863117870722434
1418552,3,B00005ATQ6,"The early 1980s was the turning point in the depiction of gay and lesbian stories on film, when movies released by major studios and distributors moved away from the stereotype of the lecherous, wicked, or transvestite homosexual. Released during this era, this German movie deals unabashedly with the theme of two women in love and trying to stay alive during the Nazi occupation of France. The Nazis condemned homosexuals to die in concentration camps and to this day I don't think anyone knows how many escaped Hitler's ""purification"" of society -- that one of the two main characters is also Jewish would probably compound the death sentence with torture. The story also offers an important reminder that the Vichy government was rammed down the throats of the French people and while some were collaborators, many others stood up to the Nazis in their own unsung ways. In the unfolding, it is a bit of a stretch to have both the brother and mother of one of the two women accept her lesbianity with hardly a blink of an eye, but to do otherwise would have probably bogged down the story and taken it on a different direction. The film stock is salvaged but not rough, and its quality does not diminish the performances and production. ""November Moon"" is an important gem in the continually growing library of Gay and Lesbian cinema.",1319155200,14,1337,4.792207792207792

7935847,5,B00005ATQ6,It's interesting that I chose two films that were both described as classic lesbian stories moving and powerful. This November Moon and Aimee and Jaguar are WWII period films. I think they are both in German. In this I think the two women end up in occupied France near the end of the war.  I would guess they are rather true to history and what it was like to walk a line. One of the women is Jewish. The other takes a German Officer as a lover for strategic reasons and is then branded a collaborator.,1493596800,,503,4.239583333333333
