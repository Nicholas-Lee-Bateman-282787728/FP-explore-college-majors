8249774,1,B000063K0L,"This anime has the worst dialogue I've ever heard.  The plot is rushed and one-dimensional.  There is no real conflict throughout the whole movie except: ""Stop the evil mastermind from becoming all-powerful""  The voice-acting is so bad that I felt physical pain in my brain from listening to it.  The characters were unimaginative and fake.  Half the lines in the movie were repeated over and over again Mojo-Jojo (Powerpuff Girls) style.  The animation is quite good quality, but unfortunately, that's the only positive in the whole thing.  This is a complete waste of money, if you want a good fantasy anime, go get Legend Of Crystania or Berserk.",1028073600,4,649,4.953703703703703
8249775,5,B000063K0L,"This is a very cool anime that gets away from the sci-fi and leads into the realm of fable. I was very impressed by the English dub. The voice actors are excellent, especially the lead; Agahali, voice-acted by Ally Coyote, who is a well-known comic and actor in Toronto.
I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1016496000,2,300,4.574074074074074
