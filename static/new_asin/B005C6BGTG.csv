4651616,2,B005C6BGTG,"I was really interested in the history of the harsh treatment the native Americans received from the bigoted christians,until the so called paranormal investigators took over completely. Then I had to stop watching to keep from losing IQ points. Why can't someone find spokespeople on paranormal with above a 50 IQ for these programs or is it just the fact that we have to watch idiots to feel better about ourselves. I'm sure there are people much more intelligent who can speak on these subjects, I want to believe but garbage like this makes it very hard. Gave it two for the native input. As far as the trailer trash investigators 0.",1373068800,2,637,4.696428571428571

4651618,5,B005C6BGTG,"Beautifully written and directed by the fantastic Booth Brothers!

4651619,3,B005C6BGTG,"I am a huge fan of the Booth brothers. And when this was advertised I admit I was eager to see it because I have seen the work these folks have done prior so I believed this one would be awesome. I was wrong. I mean it is good in certain parts but overall I feel ripped off and wish I had not spent the $20 on it (it was in fact originally priced much higher).

It was drawn out in parts - more focused on the background music score (which after the first two times hearing it got old real fast). The flow of the 'documentary' was not concise. They repeat scenes multiple times. Apparently in effort to make the video longer or something. They didn't back up the guest psychic lady's interpretations during the 'investigation'- leaving only her word as to what was going on. The camera operator would not stop zooming in and out (especially during the interview in the 'special features' portion). It was like a child operating it or someone on some serious dope. I was left wanting and felt as if this was made by an understudy of the brothers or something along those lines. Amateurs have done far better films than this one. What happened guys?

I am disappointed in this - where it could have gone it didn't. What it should have exposed wasn't conveyed properly. This had so much more potential to it and instead of opening peoples' eyes to the terrible reality of the subject (like for instance in Children of the Grave) I actually found my eyes closing.

See it for yourself but I cannot say I recommend it. I certainly don't think anyone should pay more than $10.",1369094400,9,1570,4.406896551724138

4651621,5,B005C6BGTG,"With each Documentary The Brothers release They set the standard for how a great film is judged,and Soul Catcher is no exception. From the moment You begin watching this film it becomes obvious the Booth's put heart and soul into every frame of this even more obvious labor of love. It is so easy to see that this is a subject that They feel very deeply about. The theft of an entire generation of Native Americans  culture and way of life is a subject few Americans know about and is a very dark time in American history. Through recreations and interviews with some of the people who lived through it,this part of history is stunningly brought to life. Also once again with the help of respected Paranormal Investigator Kieth Age the most amazing evidence has been captured. From class A EVP to the best Thermal Camera images I have ever seen. There is no way I can praise this film enough,I doubt anyone can. If You want one of the greatest Paranormal documentaries You have and probably will ever see,buy a copy of Soul Catcher,it will amaze You,touch Your heart and give You the chills.",1312761600,3,1091,4.5948717948717945
4651622,5,B005C6BGTG,"Fans of the Booth brother's are in for a treat, and luckily they pour their passion into the paranormal genre because Soul Catcher, their latest film, will take you on a wild spiritual ride. Soul Catcher starts out in the Mojave desert where they get into a 1939 German spy plane and fly across the desert to land in the lake beds to look for the medicine wheel, which they do find. The film deals with the haunting of the earth and they pulled EVP's from the ground in several locations. They stopped in El Reno, Oklahoma and filmed the Indian boarding schools that are haunted by the spirits of Indian children and elementals outside, animalistic, the one's with green eyes and growling, shadows 20 feet high, skinwalkers, shapeshifters and the legend of deer women. The Native American interviews will describe the real tragedies which encompass the school house haunting as well as the legends that the Indians believe and the ones that are made up to protect their tribes from other tribes and cowboys. Interesting EVP's from the schools will be played and those EVPs are not in English. The Booth's have tagged this film as their biggest, epic, Supernatural Adventure to date. Other Booth Brothers films include, The Haunted Boy, Death Tunnel, DarkPlace, The Possessed, Spooked, The Ghosts of Waverly Hills Sanatorium, Children of the Grave as seen on SyFy and Sony Pictures.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Haunted-Boy-The-Secret-Diary-Of-The-Exorcist/dp/B00421HQ82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Haunted Boy, The Secret Diary Of The Exorcist</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-the-Grave/dp/B000VKN1XM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of the Grave</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Possessed/dp/B002348RFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Possessed</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spooked-The-Ghosts-Of-Waverly-Hills-Sanatorium/dp/B000HEVZSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spooked The Ghosts Of Waverly Hills Sanatorium</a>",1310601600,17,2108,6.958490566037736
4651623,3,B005C6BGTG,"I would of liked it more if the breathing from the overweight guy, wasn't so projecting. Some probably won't even notice, but I suppose it being a pet peeve of mine (breathing heavily into something, where everyone can hear you for no apparent reason), it was bothersome in some of the parts. At that time, I couldn't hear anything else but the overlay breathing. :|

As for the movie itself, it's heart-wrenching and truly awakening on part of the Native American history. They walk you around the boarding school to see where children lived/housed and were schooled into becoming ""white man"".

Having Sioux Indian in my blood, it was very upsetting to be reminded of the haircutting, and know it to be true. I was told by an Indian Chief long ago and my great grandfather, that the 'white man made them cut their hair... and take pictures.. and if you didn't, they'd hold you down and do it, threaten you, even kill things you loved."" and as I was told by my great grandmother while I was growing up, ""our hair is to be treated as part of our soul and it's our strength. You honor it by taking care of it because it will take care of you."" Taking pictures; they believed it took part of their soul. I turned my great grandmother around on that, somewhat, but not so much for my great grandfather; he'd have nothing to do with it and would do nothing but shake his finger at me, warn me and try to take my camera away to break it. Maybe that's why I act like I have no soul.  ...joking. That part was a joke. calm down.

Loved the movie guys.. just fix the guy breathing into his mic.",1502323200,,1585,4.344594594594595
4651624,5,B005C6BGTG,"Heartbreaking, soul wrenching documentary produced and directed with so much respect for the Navajo Indian Nation. It shames me to the core that their dignity could be taken away from them with a hair cut.

But being American Indian myself, it's a dark past in U.S. history that American's should hear the truth of. The spirit world is real, the bording school's were as real as the holocaust presented to our people's by the white's. The people had to hide our ceremonies & languages, or many times be hung just for not being white. This racial extermination was all over North America.

Outside of the social issue message of the film, I don't really understand why they were there.

4651695,1,B005C6BGTG,"My fiancee and I, who avidly watch documentaries of various formats (but especially those on paranormal or anything outside of the social norm), thought we'd give this a try if only for the fact that the premise sounded interesting in comparison to others in the genre.

Unfortunately what we got was ""The Booth Brothers"". Neither of us had ever seen or heard of this duo, so we certainly approached it with an open mind. However, there was no satisfying us as viewers with this poorly captured, terribly edited, and relatively unintelligible mockery of a documentary. We wanted to like it. We tried quite hard actually. But the truth is it's just awful. Generally within the first ten minutes of any documentary there is a solid informational prologue that takes you through what you are about to experience via facts, footage, and re-enactments. Though all historical information was completely absent here, as was any vintage footage; it was instead replaced by a fumbling montage of uninteresting re-enactments, boring footage filmed by the crew, and badly formulated edits that bounced to and fro disconnected images. Overall, each scene lacked any real substance. Worse yet, the entirety of this is laid over with 'impending' ambient music... and some really poorly contrived drums that kicked in each time the camera zoomed in on something.

During one of the discombobulated edits, there was a point where a School House was shown, and the captioning actually said ""Not the actual school house, but this is what it would have looked like."" Not so bad, perhaps, if the next scene wouldn't have cut straight to them standing outside of ""a"" school house with all the impending music thundering through. I had no idea what was going on. Were they at the Boarding House that was supposedly the point of the film, or were they outside of the fake one? My, my... not cool at all.

All of this might have been tolerable had there been some form of content prevalent. Sadly, in place of actual content, we're greeted with stories from Native American people on what they've seen, the stories they've heard, and what might be lurking into the place the brothers are supposedly heading into. Wait, I mean: that they were supposedly in. But not in yet. Or were they? You know, it was all really hard to tell because they kept jumping back and forth with any sense of linear story telling. And the worst of all of this last paragraph, is that the Native American interviewee's stories might have well been interesting, but the editing was so awful and the interviewers were so atrocious that there was no place to really let anything sink in. Why tell a story to the audience when you can Quick cut - Zoom (drum drum drum) - Quick cut - Zoom (drum drum drum), Cut to new scene, Cut to Old scene, wash rinse repeat.

Perhaps the best way to describe it in short is as a badly done You Tube commercial extended to a full run-time.

Even so... we stuck with this 'film' for quite awhile, highly anticipating some sense of historical background on the subject matter. But rather than this, we were given barely intelligible commentary while following around a shaky camera that only showed us the same things again and again and again. Ah, but let's not forget to cut back to the same edited scene we were shown just five minutes ago, because we hadn't seen that one twice already. Oh wait, yes we did. Sorry, it was all rather confusing.

I'd like to say that it was artistic... but I'm an artist and therefore understand the nature of a montage - abstract or otherwise. This was not it. It was sloppy work, poorly thought-out, terribly edited, and failed to reach anything greater than a waste of our time. So much so that I feel sorry for all of the interviewees who agreed to be a part of this travesty. Looking beyond these complaints, the greatest tragedy here is that the premise alone was actually a great one. Had this been done correctly, even by talented amateur filmmakers, this could have been stunning. However, there's just no denying it: ""Soul Catcher"" is the very definition of failure.

For those of you still with me, you see I've written here quite a bit for my review. Here's the real kicker: we turned it off just over the 37mn mark. If nearly 40mn into a ""documentary"" you learn absolutely nothing and suddenly find yourself equating the IQ of the ""filmmakers"" to be nearing the cartoon character Elmer Fudd (who likely would have been more charming to watch), you know you're in a bad spot. Oh, and a note for the person in charge of subtitling the dialogue: it's ""per se"", not ""per say"".

No offense intended, Booth Brothers... but you need to give up the ghost on this step in your not-so-creative life. My fiance and I will most certainly be paying attention to all future paranormal documentaries, and if ""The Booth Brothers"" are attached to it we'll be heading the other direction.

A rating of 1 star (even if forced by amazon) is being kind.",1374019200,2,4963,4.695402298850575

Well bias opinion almost cut me out of this wonderful heart breaking and truly exciting documentary. I'm a fan of Keith Age and now I'm a fan of The Booth Brothers. This is such an eye-opener for those who did not realize that Native American children were treated so mercilessly and the suffering from being ripped away your culture and your parents  and forced to absorb another, in a wilderness where abuse was never reported or cared about (at this time in history) Not only did the Booth Brothers accurately show the suffering of the remaining living victims but the spirits that remain in these places as well.
