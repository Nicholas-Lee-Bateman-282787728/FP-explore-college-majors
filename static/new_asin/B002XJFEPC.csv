8383742,2,B002XJFEPC,"The quality of the video is quite poor and his method of teaching is just not helpful to me. Not enough structure or clear teaching points-  I just didn't get anything out of this video and. though most push hands DVDs and books are difficult to decipher,. this one is especially so.

Too bad because he comes from a good tai chi lineage, has been around for a long time and his two books, though wordy, have some merit.  Instead of this push hands DVD, I'd go with videos by Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming  or Michael Gilman (both free and for sale) or some of the free YouTube videos by Gene Burnette or Expert Village.",1522627200,,610,4.324561403508772
8383743,5,B002XJFEPC,"I second everything reviewer J Blue said. If you're in a small, say Midwestern town and you do your solo routine in solitude and wonder how to maintain your interest, this could be what you want. This is the third Jesse Tsao vid I've watched and they're all very clear and informative -- I'm going to look for everything he's done.",1469577600,,331,4.442622950819672
8383744,5,B002XJFEPC,"Very clear instruction, multiple angles, helpful repetition, great structure & form, simplified discussion, good camera/sound, & a sense of joy!

This video is a great introduction to the basic patterns often used in Chen/Yang style pushing hand practice (Tui Shou). (I've never met the instructor, but he looks like he'd be fun to train with.)

Pushing hands is a great deal of fun, and this video is a wonderful place to start!
