5124224,5,B0082SIQB2,"I was on vacation and watched the last half of this concert on a local PBS station in my hotel room.  It was jaw-dropping!  The next morning, I looked it up on-line at Amazon and ordered it!  The concert was fantastic!  I did not realize how talented C.F.(Fred) Turner is!  He is a very underrated Bass guitarist (but then Bass players usually are, unless you are Geddy Lee of Rush!).  I am a huge fan of the Guess Who and Bachman Turner Overdrive.  Bachman and Turner's greatest hits make up the majority of the concert; Not Fragile and Blue Collar were fabulous; a couple of OK new songs, an OK rendition of American Woman (one of my favorite Guess Who songs!) and I was absolutely stunned when Randy Bachman called Paul Shaffer to the stage to play on Shakin' All Over (great song!), Roll on Down the Highway (Turner is as good as ever on vocals!) and the finale Takin Care of Business.  They did not play Gimme Your Money Please!  If you are a fan of Randy Bachman (The Guess Who or B.T.O.) you will enjoy this concert DVD!

5124226,4,B0082SIQB2,"A good DVD of a late 2010 gig put on by Bachman and Turner. Turner's voice is a little rough but works pretty well in the live setting. The band sounds good. Only the audience, who seems half-asleep (kinda strange for a New York audience, isn't it?), is puzzling here. Despite the audience only coming out of their zombie-esque state for the encore ""Takin' Care of Business,"" Bachman, Turner and their colleagues turn in a fine effort. Fans of BTO, Bachman & Turner and Bachman's guitar playing will be pleased.",1339632000,12,511,4.688888888888889

5124237,5,B0082SIQB2,Believe it or not Bachman & Turner came to the Alaska State Fair in Palmer Alaska last summer. It was pouring down rain but that does not stop a Alaska outdoor concert. They played all the hits and then some. They sounded just as fresh and on cue as they did in the 70's. If you are a fan of BTO and you must be if you are reading this you cant go wrong with putting this concert in your library. I am a classic rock fan and have been since they coined the phrase classic rock. How can you have a classis rock DVD or Blue Ray collection without BTO. This concert will take you back to the day when rock was rock and concerts was a way of life. Buy the concert you will not be disappointed.,1438041600,,689,3.964028776978417
5124238,5,B0082SIQB2,This is an outstanding show.  I never realized what an excellent bass player Fred Turner is until seeing him on this DVD.

I never really knew how versatile both Randy and Fred were in playing rock, jazz and boogie. If you love a good time, enjoy listening to a group that should get more play time on what's left of radio today for some of their newest songs, this video is a must watch. This is one of those sleeper DVD's / Blu-Rays. If you love rock, put this in your collection. I know I will be playing it over and over again for years to come.",1412380800,,528,3.990566037735849

5124262,5,B0082SIQB2,"Fred and Randy can still rock. Randy was really one of rocks best guitarists in the early 1970's , Fred has one of the most distinctive voices. They look like they are having a good time . Good set list , but they had more they could have played. I enjoyed the concert and am happy they came back before Father Time had his way with them",1392336000,,337,4.044776119402985
5124263,5,B0082SIQB2,"Great sound, well produced concert, this was better than I expected.

5124269,5,B0082SIQB2,Great. I grew up blasting BTO out of my Camaro. This concert takes me back to a better time and place. Get this and ask yourself this question. Is Fred Turner the greatest Bass player to ever live??? I think so.,1380067200,,211,4.170731707317073
5124270,5,B0082SIQB2,"Retrospect can be cruel or kind...That said, this retrospect of Bachman-Turner Overdrive with only Randy Bachman and C.F. Turner hits a real ""bulls-eye"" of goodness.  BTO was kinda like Lynyrd Skynyrd but even more workmanlike.  Simple heavy riffs melded with some good melody as well as hooks.  This stuff wasn't rocket-science.  Or was it maybe better than we'd realized at the time?  Me thinks so as this DVD brings into focus.

First, the band had a really nice heaviness that was so direct it was primal.  Not to waste that the band also had some pop sensibility as witnessed by their classic ""Takin' Care of Business"" monster hit.  Too many casual fans simply stop there and it's their loss.  This DVD really shows what a jewel of a bassist C.F. Turner is.  He is heavy as any helacious bass player should be, but he's also really delicate running all around the fretboard to make melody counter-points that hit like a ""sledgehammer"" (pun intended).  Bass simply doesn't get better even if it gets more intricate.  Let's not stop here...C.F. is one of the best guttural sounding vocalists I've ever heard because he actually has a bit of range to go with it as well as a sensibility where he can be raw (American Woman) or emotive (Blue Collar).  This guy is a huge reason BTO is even more than the sum  of the individual parts.  C.F. Turner is king here.

But wait, there is also one of the most under-rated guitarists of the entire rock genre also on-board.  Randy Bachman would simply be the uber-guitar god if he looked like Steve Vai.  He doesn't look like Steve Vai, however, but he's actually just as talented.  He's in a way smarter because he has made that talent so accessible, and melodic, that in it's supreme goodness it gets overlooked.  Not so much here though!  Randy Bachman hits the right notes with inspiration leaving out anything superfluous that may well detract.  Nuance and crunch come together in Randy Bachman's style which is both heavy metal and jazz inspired simultaneously.  Wow! Tasty as hell with absolutely no flash that reeks of self-indulgence...Rare!  Then there's Randy's vocals which are about as honest as any in all of rock music.  No he doesn't have amazing range, in fact his range is pretty damn limited, but the guys knows how to use what he's got and I respect that.  Combined with C.F. Turner there is awesome songcraft here.

Others have gone into the song selection so I'll not be redundant except to say BTO has an excellent catalog to work out of .  There's the omission of songs that should be forgotten, there's the one's that should be brought back for your inspection, and there is a few new ones and covers (American Woman is a cover here) which all add up to a really excellent show.  I'm so glad these two guys refused to call BTO a day.  I liked them pretty good in the day (especially the first two LPs) and I respect them so much here words can convey it.  This is a must see for fans and a recommendation of those who in 2013 are starved for simple good old rock and roll.",1377216000,4,3039,4.572222222222222

5124274,5,B0082SIQB2,"If you are fan of Bachman Turner Overdrive, like I am, then this is a must Blu-ray for your collection. Randy Bachman and CF Turner are still in excellent form in this live concert from late 2010. They perform all their hits and some new songs from their new cd. Don't believe that these guys are just going along on the string here. They rock. They have an excellent back up band behind them, but let there be no mistake, they are in full control here. CF turners vocals still in great shape. He growls and screams and his bass playing is still on the mark. Randy Bachman is still sharp, and tight on his lead guitar. Video quality on this disc is excellent, sharp, good color, and crystal clear. These guys are old school, so they stick to old school as far as tech goes. No loseless audio here, only standard 2.0 or Dolby Digital 5.1. I played both audios, and they are both good, but the 5.1 is preferred for me. No fantastic surround, but good. So in closing, a great 90 minute concert, rocking and fun all the way. All the hits, and even the new songs are very good, excellent video and good audio. It is the next best thing to being there. One of my favorite Blu-ray concert performances. Highly recommended!!",1368403200,2,1216,4.384955752212389

5124277,5,B0082SIQB2,"Live From the Rosewood Ballroom (2010), features former Bachman Turner Overdrive bandmates Randy Bachman, and C.F. (Fred) Turner reuniting as ""Bachman and Turner"", performing BTO classics, as well as songs from their new reunion album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bachman-Turner/dp/B003XNKFLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bachman & Turner</a>&nbsp;(2010).

With an array of metal framed beams for mounting lighting adorning the stage of the Rosewood Ballroom in New York City, the setting seems somewhat appropriate, as BTO used metal gears as their symbol.  For a couple of 67 year old guys, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner, are still amazing performers.  They still sport beards, although they have turned white, and seem to be in good health, and in very good spirits.  These grizzled veteran rockers from Winnipeg, Canada, are truly an inspiration, as they power their way through the 92 minute performance, that is a testament to their enduring love for rock.  Randy's playing is rock solid, as he handles nearly all of the lead guitar parts, despite there being two other guitarists onstage.  Remarkably, Fred's voice sounds just as gruff and powerful as it did in BTO's glory years, still capable of sending chills up your spine.

Bachman Turner Overdrive was a remarkably talented band, capable of producing some diverse music.  With Randy Bachman's soft singing voice, contrasting with Fred Turner's gravelly growl, the band had kind of a Yin and Yang thing going musically, particularly as early on, the band incorporated jazz elements and cool time changes.  Played at little slower pace, the songs can be appreciated like a fine wine, and still delivers quite a kick.  Rounding out the band are Marc Lafrance on drums, and guitarists Mick Dalla-Vee and Brent Howard Knudsen.

The 20 song setlist includes their hits ""Hey You"", ""Let It Ride"", ""Roll On Down the Highway"", ""You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet"", and ""Takin' Care of Business"", as well as favorites, ""Looking Out For #1"", ""Four Wheel Drive"", ""Hold Back The Water"", ""Not Fragile"", ""Rock Is My Life"", and ""Blue Collar"".  Bachman returns to his Guess Who days on ""American Woman"".  The new Bachman Turner album is well represented with five songs.  Bachman's poignant ""Waiting Game"" is a standout track.  Fellow Canadian Paul Schaffer joins the band for their final three numbers including a cover of ""Shakin' All Over"", Bachman's first hit with the Guess Who.

The video production is first class, with nice coverage of the performance, without a lot of quick cuts.  The focus is mainly on Turner and Bachman, as most of the band is seen mostly in wide shots, and there isn't too much coverage of the audience, who are in theater seats.  The only disappointment is the lack of any bonus features.

They don't seem to get a lot of recognition for it now, but Bachman Turner Overdrive were one of the pioneers of hard rock, bringing some heavy guitar to the AM airwaves, at a time in the early 1970's, when soft rock artists like The Carpenters, The Jackson Five, Helen Reddy, Elton John, and Three Dog Night, were riding high on the pop charts.

For fans of Randy Bachman and Fred Turner, it was wonderful to hear that after so many years, they were working together again.  The name ""Bachman & Turner"" was chosen, because of ongoing legal issues concerning the name ""Bachman Turner Overdrive"".  While others their age are enjoying their retirement years, these gentlemen are still amazing musicians.  This performance is a worthy addition to any fan's collection.",1366502400,4,3568,5.177700348432055

I'm not familiar with the other band members in the group, but they are obviously solid and tight and play BTO to it's purest form.  If you ever have a chance to see B & T in concert, don't let those tickets pass.  You will not be disappointed.  They put on a great concert, have good stage presence and the everlasting ""feel good"" rhythms are still rocking into 2011 and 2012.",1351296000,,758,4.449275362318841
5124289,5,B0082SIQB2,"SUMMARY:  Excellent.  There isn't much out there on BTO DVD and this has most of there most awesome songs.  When the DVD came on I smiled as it brought me right back to ther seventies.  The songs sounded exactly the same. To the  one bad review...I have no clue what they expected.  Apparently they never heard them because it was exactly the same.
Excellent video, excellent sound, excellent songs, and it's 90 minutes.  CLASSIC.",1351209600,,430,4.72972972972973
5124290,2,B0082SIQB2,got pulled in by an Amazon review this DVD was great but I did not love it. BTO once was a great band wish this was an concert from the 70's. sorry.,1349654400,,148,3.65625
5124291,5,B0082SIQB2,"The old guys still have it, never seen Turner before, he is great. Have been a fan of Randy Bachman for many years, one of the best guitar players in the world. Love to hear the old songs, and the new ones were great too.",1346716800,,221,3.933333333333333
5124292,5,B0082SIQB2,"From the very moment I watched this video it inmediately became one of my favorite ones. Though I'm a BTO's fan, it's not easy for me to find the appropiate words to describe it's beauty. What surprised me most was the accuracy and precision with which all the songs are performed, just exactly as they had been almost fourty years before. No changes, no different arrangements, no remixes whatsoever. Each song is a replica of the original version. Bachman and Turner have preserved their powerful voices and rythm; the band, by the way, are wonderful. I can tell you they seem to sing even better than in the old times. Enjoying the concert made me remember the first time I watched BTO on TV (The Midnight Special)in 1974. I'm so glad I bought it. A must, indeed!",1346630400,,766,4.598540145985401
5124293,5,B0082SIQB2,"These Canadian Rockers from the 1970's Mega Hit Band, ""Bachman Turner Overdrive"" (BTO) can still really, seriously ROCK!!! The vocals are shared between Bachman on electric guitar, and Turner on electric bass guitar. The songs still sound the same as they did back in the 1970's. These guys are as sharp as ever. I loved their music in the 70's, and I saw this dvd advertised, so I bought it, and I love it.

My favorite songs are ""Let it Ride"", ""American Woman"", ""You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet"", & ""Takin' Care of Business"", however, all the songs are great, this is a fantastic concert from the very beginning to the very end. It has a running time of about 90 minutes. If you liked BTO from the 70's you'll really enjoy this concert DVD.

Also, Randy Bachman is in the Canadian Rock Band ""The Guess Who"". If you don't already have it, then I highly reommend ""The Guess Who"" concert DVD, ""Running Across Canada"" or something similiar to that name. It's also a fantastic concert DVD, featuring Randy Bachman & Burton Cummings.",1346198400,,1024,4.6208791208791204

5124295,5,B0082SIQB2,This is a must have for BTO fans. I was in the house when this was filmed. Actually won tickets from BTO to be there. The band was tight and sounded fantastic. Getting American Woman at a BTO show was bonus. So everyone should get a copy of Bachman & Turner's `Live at the Roseland Ballroom.,1344816000,,291,4.214285714285714
5124296,5,B0082SIQB2,"Since the heady rock and roll days of the seventies, Bachman-Turner Overdrive sold over 30 million records in over 20 countries. Their music still stands as strong today as it ever has. Now, to the delight of BTO fans everywhere, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner release a live DVD set called, Bachman & Turner Live at the Roseland Ballroom, NYC.

While this is the bands third strickly concert DVD, technological advancements make this their best one to date. Fans are going to love this set as it is chock full of all their great hits (plus some) resulting in ninety minutes of some of the greatest rock and roll money can buy.  You'll get the hits like You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet, Takin' Care of Business, Hey You, and Let It Ride, plus many, many others. Also included in the 20-song set list are some songs from their self-titled album that came out shortly before this 2010 performance.  Those tunes include Rollin' Along, That's What It Is, Moonlight Rider, and Waiting Game.

Like I said, fans are absolutely going to love this concert DVD.

Bachman and Turner shared turns at lead vocals with Bachman handling the lead guitar work and Turner thumping the bass.  They were joined by Marc LaFrance on drums, Brent Howard Knudsen on guitars and Mick Dalla-Vee on guitars. Oh, and the great Paul Shaffer helps out on the keys, too.  How cool is that?

So, if you loved the CD set that is the soundtrack of this DVD, you'll definitely want this concert as part of your video library.
