3425476,5,B00198X0YU,"I started watching this show since the first season along with Dancing with the Stars and right away I got hooked.  Dancing with the Stars however lost me after season 3 but SYTYCD didn't, reason is these are real dancers showing you how the pro does it and how great it looks.  These are not mediocre stars trying to bounce back or gain publicity with a reality show.  These are dancers with professional training trying to make it in a tough industry.  Each dancer struggles with dance styles out of their element but often surprise you with how versatile they are.  The variety of dance styles and professionalism surpass Dancing with the Stars by far or any dance show ever out.  Judges know what they are talking about.  Choreographers are also top of the line.  I mean Wade Robson, Mia Michaels, Shane Sparks, Brian Friedman, Mandy Moore, Alex De Silva, Mary Murphy, where are you going to find another show or even a pop star concert with so much talents.  It is inspiring and PURE entertainment.  I'm so happy this show came out and can make America love and appreciate dance again.  If you love dance, you don't want to miss this, I don't care what age you are.  It will inspire you to go take a beginners dance class in whatever dance style you are into and have lots of fun!  I waited so long for them to come out on DVD and almost lost hope.  I am buying every season on DVD.",1214956800,80,1387,4.409448818897638

3425478,5,B00198X0YU,"I agree with KJT:  So You Think You Can Dance is the BEST show on TV period!  Every year it gets better, and I find myself eagerly awaiting the next season.  Season Four is outrageous so far!  And there are dance routines from this show that I will never forget - like the Hummingbird and Butterfly from last year, and Mia's dance with Travis and a blonde girl where they used a bench (VERY romantic and sensual!)  WOW!! So, PUULLEEEEESe bring on the DVD's!!!!!",1214438400,60,461,4.440476190476191
3425479,5,B00198X0YU,"Besides the wonderful entertainment, you, the viewer get to learn about dance from the excellent commentary, praise and critcism.  And while that is happening, the replay pertaining runs.

These dancers are NOT like the Dancing with The Stars Hasbeens who have never danced in their life.  These people are authentic dancers, and that is where this show becomes entertainment and not a joke.

Hot Tamale Train-Mary!
The judges are excellent, except you can take only so much of the screaming, yelping, yapping, Hot Tamale Train-Mary! But aside from that she provides good criticism.  And what I like about the judges is that they were past dancers/choreographers.  They know their craft.

Dance Numbers
These young dancers have toned bodies, excellent dance lines, experience, grace, style, etc.  They perform to music we know and like.  And they are under the instruction of famed choreographers, which is a huge contribution.  The dance numbers are amazing!  Some are just so beautiful you just gaze at every step they take, every move they make, every breath they take...oooops, wrong song!!

Versatility and Variety
With a range of styles the choreographers bring, we get to see all styles of dance, jazz, ballroom, crimp, hip hop, waltz, contemporary, etc., etc.  What a showcase of dance styles, costumes, hairstyles and routines.

Professional Dance Groups and Entertainers too!
What I really like is that some speciality groups dance, or the cast does fantastic group dances.  The musical entertainers enhance the show.

Can't wait for more....Rizzo",1214438400,9,1557,5.2682926829268295
3425480,5,B00198X0YU,"Without a doubt this is the best dance show on TV, (and for me show period.) Compared with how the show is run now, Season One will seem a little discombobulated, but the dancers are supreme. Blake, Melody, Ardem (sp?) and the winner, Nick, are some of the best dancers the show's had on. Ardem's Pasa-doble is still the benchmark for all other like dances. The same core of choreographers have been with the show all four seasons, and they are who make the show so interesting. The different styles and dancers' ability to adapt is intriguing.",1211760000,6,544,4.618556701030927

3425535,5,B00198X0YU,"I understand reference to music rights on the show. But, the songs used on the show are purchased separately and the show provides good advertisement for the song writers and performers. I know because when I hear music I like on the show I purchase it (legally) off the internet. Surely, some reasonable agreement can be met so the public and fans won't be denied the pleasure of one of the best shows ever on TV!!!! People think of your fans.

3425538,5,B00198X0YU,"I'm pretty sure it has a lot to do with the music rights. There are hundreds of songs that they only had permission to use once for the show. They would have to pay tons more to put it on a disc, and then there would be hardly any profit. Sadly this isn't the kind of thing that can be removed, like they did with the Daria music. I'm sure we'll just have to watch our favorite videos of SYTYCD on YouTube.",1372723200,,406,3.9634146341463414
3425539,4,B00198X0YU,"This show is amazing, and it always has been. A lot of people actually loved the older seasons more than the newer ones. DVD's of each season would make Fox a lot of money.

So why haven't they been released?

I think I  know the reason...

Yes, it's true that Fox has the broadcast rights, but not the DVD ones. However, there HAS to be more to it than that, and y'all can probably figure it out, too. Think about this: seasons 8 and 9 are constantly being rebroadcast. on Ovation. Over and over and over again. Remember-- Fox could authorize the rebroadcast every show from Season 1 on. So WHY haven't they done it? Where are all the reruns of 1-7?

The only reason that really makes any sense is that they're holding out in hopes of getting the music rights for DVD. There's no other explanation that would cover it. If they KNEW they had no chance of ever getting these rights, then we'd be seeing those other 7 seasons on Ovation (or wherever. I don't THINK 7 has been rerun; I know that the rest haven't been.)

So I guess that in a way, this could be a good thing. It might mean that we'll eventually see those DVD's after all. Still, it would be nice to have someone from Fox say this.",1362787200,5,1193,4.256637168141593
3425540,5,B00198X0YU,Why don't they release the seasons on DVD? I would LOVE to buy them and rewatch all the wonderful dancing. Please put this show out on DVD for the fans. I watched all the encore episodes on Ovation. I know there is a market for this.,1362441600,,233,4.086956521739131
3425541,5,B00198X0YU,"Why oh why aren't there videos/CDs to purchase for this series?  I tape what I can and watch them over and over, but eventually they get lost for some technical reason.

3425542,5,B00198X0YU,"I don't think there is any excuse for Fox not to release season sets for SYTYCD, especially after seeing Glee release their seasons almost immediately.  I mean Glee has just as many songs and royalties to worry about.  Fox should at least release Season 4 as a trial balloon.  That was the season for me which had the best couples, and some of the best dances of all.  I would buy all 9 seasons tomorrow, if I could.",1344902400,8,416,4.294871794871795
3425543,5,B00198X0YU,"So You Think You Can Dance is the best show on t.v. this season and has been, in my opinion, since the first season aired.  I would like so much to purchase each and every season so I can watch all the amazing dances and contestants perform.  I have seen their tour and while it was wonderful, I enjoy watching it on television even more and would so much like to own a dvd of each and every season.  Please, please release the shows to dvd and please, please do it sooooooooon.

3425575,5,B00198X0YU,"I have been waiting patiently for years since the show first came out and have been saying repeatedly that they should put it out on DVD. Personally, I would buy EVERY season because I want to watch it again and again. There are some epically great routines and moments in the past seasons. And sadly I have not been able to watch a lot of them either since I am in the military and am out to sea A LOT.

3425577,5,B00198X0YU,"FOX honestly needs to release this show out on DVD. Of all the competition shows, this one has always been my favorite. There is so much passion and beauty through movement and I have been blessed to see a lot of breathtaking performances. This show has something for everyone.

My husband is an extremely manly man and even he will sit a watch some of them with me and be amazed. I love the contemporary dances -- my sisters and I watch YouTube videos of our favorite performances for hours. I could go on and on but you get the idea.",1339632000,,535,4.297029702970297

3425597,5,B00198X0YU,"So true, I have been hooked on this show for years. It is the best thing since sliced bread! I don't want each complete season, like with the tryouts, only if it's the tryout of who made it to the top 20. I want the best dances from each season. I missed the first season, and came to watch in the middle of season 2. So all I know is that season 3 was the best to me. I loved all the dancers! the choreography was amazing. i want to see Hok & Jaimie dance-Hummingbird + Flower.
Chelsie Hightower & Mark Kanemura's --Bleeding Love.
I even like & understand Hiphop and crump. It is so amazing to see those young people fly through the air.
I think this show has done so much more for the arts than ""american idol"". I love to see them working to promote dance to children and to schools.
SO BRING ON THE DVDS!!!",1307059200,,809,4.09433962264151

3425600,5,B00198X0YU,Honestly I think the reason why Fox is having such a tough time getting this out on DVD is the copyrights with all the songs used.  The same thing happens with old tv shows like the wonder years and stuff like that where there was a ton of music in the shows that they can't get the rights to.  I really do hope they can get it worked out.,1305936000,2,339,3.898550724637681

It not only spotlights the greatest dancers coming up but choreographers who absolutely take my breathe away. It just seems crazy that you can't buy the season DVD's.  WHat kind of capitalist society is this?
I'm glad that these dancers get a chance to make some money doing this kind of DVD...but...they are artists first and deserved to occasionally be treated that way.

3425616,5,B00198X0YU,"the only reason I can see for not releasing this show, season by season, to DVD is that the accompaniment to each dance is from copyrighted material and they might have trouble getting clearance.  But WOW, the dancing on this show is as spectacular as it comes.  Take the season just ending.  Three young people, aged 18 and 19, did some amazing dancing, and the rest of the cast was close behind.  Okay, I think Kent or Rob should have won, but that's beside the point.  I would include the dancing only, except where an explanation of the content might help.  But the choreography does not go easy just because they are young dancers.  Forget some of the junk dancing you see in videos.  This is the real stuff, and hometowns are justifiably proud when their native sons or daughters get into the final 4 or 5.

I've been DVD-ing the final two shows for three seasons, and it makes for wonderful viewing.  Come on, Fox, give us this show, season by season, on DVD.  It won't hurt the popularity of the show and will help the careers of each dancer.",1288569600,,1050,4.445026178010472

I have no idea why we can't buy the videos of the individual performances immediately after the show like they allow you to buy the songs from American Idol.  It probably has something to do with the rights to the music that they dance to.  I love these dancers.  I want to financially support them.  I want to buy their performances.  I want to buy a DVD of their performances at the end of the show.  I want to be able to put on a DVD and relive their best performances.

Not only is the music stunning, but I've been introduced to SO many fabulous musicians (One Republic, Leona Lewis, Katy Perry, and more)whose music I went right out and purchased.  In fact SYTYCD is one of my main sources for new music.  Getting the rights for all the songs used is work, but worth it.

I've sucked up space on my DVR for years saving old SYTYCD episodes.  My personal favorite was Season 4.  SO much amazing work, and the dancers were all such quirky fun personalities with reams of talent.  Would love to own that show.  But heck, sell them as single downloads.  One song, one dance.  Bottom line is this is a money maker, and there's too much talent here going unappreciated by people who missed the earlier seasons.",1268697600,,842,4.553333333333334

I watch just a few TV programs but as a lover of dance I decided to look at this.  I don't know if I thought it would be something like the other dance program with one professional and one celebrity so I wasn't that enticed to see it and really didn't know about it for the first few seasons.  But somehow I put this one on and loved it. I am disappointed however, when viewers vote as many times as they wish.  It just doesn't seem a fair vote.  It should be one vote per person.  As said the winner is not for the best dancer but the favorite.  I was so disappointed this past season (6th) that as much as most should be in the finale since all are such talented people, I was disappointed that one of my favorite dancers didn't make it to the finale.  And it was just at the end there.  And as great as the winner is it might not always be my favorite. But that's how this program works.  I do hope all of these marvelous dancers much success and I wish we could find out what happens to them.  Love this program.  Have it taped so I won't miss it.  I'm taping some myself but it would be so nice to be able to have the series as DVDs and I can then watch the first four seasons I missed and I would be buying each season of this wonderful series.  When people tell me they dislike reality shows --this is such an exception.  There is such talent here and know these performers obviously are serious and work very hard to get where they are.

I've never been interested in dance shows and figured it would only be watched by women and ice skating fans... at 48 years old, I figured I already knew what I liked, and watching dance wasn't one of those things. This year I saw a promo for the show featuring a cute young blonde dancer doing hip-hop and I thought it looked sorta... hot. Watched that week and I've been hooked ever since. It took me 48 years to discover that watching dance isn't ""gay"" and that I can be moved to tears by the beauty and poignancy of interpretive dance. I have become such a fanatic I searched the internet to find the earlier seasons, as Fox and Lithgow have not released authorized copies of the show (probably due to the expense associated with getting the rights to the music tracks). The DVD's I bought on eBay are sometimes good, sometimes awful, but at least I've gotten to see the earlier seasons of the show, which just makes me hungrier to see these puppies in excellent quality. I think I'd be willing to pay $100 for BluRay sets of each season, or $50-65 for DVD sets.

I just have no interest in that sort of show, even though I know a lot of people enjoy them.  When I lived in NY, LA, and SF I used to see truly great modern dance all the time, and I thoroughly love it.  When I visit London I always seek out the great dance programs at Sadler's Wells.  But now that I live in a more rural area it's just not available.  I was bemoaning this lack of really good modern dance locally when a friend I'll be forever grateful to told me I really ought to try SYTYCD, because the dancers and choreographers really were quite talented.  So I did.  Oh my.  I am completely hooked on this show, anxiously awaiting each week's episodes.  The dancers are phenomenal and the choreography brilliant!  It's also a beautifully constructed show, with intelligent, knowledgeable, and fun-loving judges, a smart and beautiful host that I actually enjoy listening to, and very engaging looks at the dancers working incredibly hard and giving it everything they've got.  I've been enthralled, I've laughed, I've cried.  I've even discovered new music that I liked enough to seek out and purchase (Roisin Murphy).  I really can't recommend this show highly enough if you enjoy dance.  And since I only discovered SYTYCD in the middle of the *fifth* season, I would *so* love to have DVDs of the earlier seasons to feast on.  I'm sure it would take me a while to work my way through all that, but what a pleasure!  And, oh Powers That Be, *please* release them on Blu-ray!  I've been watching the show in HD and I would not want to go back to standard definition.  If you sell 'em, I'll buy 'em.  Please!",1254787200,2,1750,4.498412698412698

I look forward to it every season and have gotten a number of my friends hooked on the program as well. We even get together as a group now to watch the finales and cheer for all the dancers. My only critique is that I feel they should have a top female and top male dancer since they compliment each other when performing their routines. To be honest, I don't even think the ""voting"" by America is that relevant to the show... I watch it for the pure enjoyment of seeing these fabulous young dancers. They are sooooo talented and you can see how passionate they are about their craft. They truly put their hearts and souls into it and it's wonderful to see their love and enthusiasm for dance. I do hope it comes out on DVD as I just watched ""The Best of So You Think You Can Dance"" this week on TV and I got chills all over again.

Whilst the scope of possible winners (Joshua, Katee, Twitch, Will) was the greatest in Season 4; for me, whilst not wishing to take anything from Sabra, the best dancer of all the seasons was Danny.  It used to nark me no end whenever the judges harped on his withdrawn personality - so big deal who wanted him to do an Oprah on the show anyway ?  His moves did the talking !

Review edit : Season 6 has just finished showing in my country - S Africa.  What stars were both Jakob and Russell?  But then I went back to Season 4 which just made me realize its unfair to compare seasons since truly each season is special in its own way.

From Season 2 I pvr'ed every program and then program by program I edited every dance onto video - only including auditions if they were really expectional, (so often these don't make it to the final round) omitting ads, needless chit-chat, choreo sessions and even judges' feedback until the final 10 - which I then had burnt onto DVDs and even if I say so myself, I have done both the series and myself proud - its like watching a live show that flows from one great dance to the next.  What collector's items have I got here!

When life gets a little too hectic and i am down in the dumps the viewing of these DVDs just makes my spirits soar again.  Anyone interested in inheriting the collection one day?  LOL

Hope the idea to change the format to only 10 dancers who will dance with an all star partner (dancers from previous seasons)with only one dancer at a time being eliminated is not going to change the magic of this series.",1228608000,,1623,4.26797385620915

I am 25 years old. I once thought my tivo didn't record one episode and I threw a tantrum like a child!! I was almost in tears! No kidding!  Well, turns out that it did record and I was one happy and entertained camper.
Oh please please release the DVDs!!! This is the only season I have seen and am dying to see the others!! And I want a collection of 2008 awesome dances!!!",1216598400,8,644,4.394957983193278
8272623,5,B00198X0YU,"I would pay hundreds of dollars to have a DVD of all seasons.  I know they don't have the DVDs due to music right costs, and that's a shame.  There are so many songs I never would have cared about if I hadn't heard them on the show and watched the inspiring performances that accompanied the songs.  Please please please, release the seasons on DVD even if the cost is high, sell the DVDs for a high price, this kind of art and talent wrapped into one show is easily worth it's weight in Broadway performances.
I'm disabled and pretty much bedridden, so I can only see talent like this through my tv.  It would be so amazing to view past seasons over and over again.  I get chills just thinking about some of the memorable performances on the show.  And I've cried a bucket of tears across the seasons as I have been so touched by so many of the performances/choreographers.",1505520000,,874,4.364197530864198

8272626,5,B00198X0YU,"I don't know if this has been said before, and I'm not going check 100 reviews first, but you'd think they could at least release some sort of ""Top Dances"" of each season. That would drastically cut down on the amount of royalties and fees they'd have to cough up. As long as they include Twitch/Alex's Get Outta Your Mind, The Garden, The bench dance, the John Mayer bed dance, the door one with Twitch and Katee, Bleeding Love, and I'm sure I'm missing some other great dances.",1454630400,,479,4.454545454545454
8272627,5,B00198X0YU,"So You Think You Can Dance is one of my favorite shows of all time--I love the dancers, the routines, the music and the judges!  I really wish FOX would release DVDs or even better, blu-rays for this show!  I have been a loyal fan since season 1.",1451088000,,246,4.104166666666667
8272628,5,B00198X0YU,"I have never missed an episode & would love to be able to find the DVD's. Fabulous show my only complaint is the way the judging panel was changed this year. Mary Murphy's personality is badly missed & the new singer (Jason I believe is a poor substitute! Some of the best shows are actually the auditions, no lie. Bring back Misty! WOW! The other guest judges are badly missed as well.",1445558400,,386,4.375

8272630,5,B00198X0YU,I'd buy the complete collection the moment it hit the stores if they would just please release it! Give the fans what they want and release the dvds for the absolute best reality competition show on tv today!!! Supply and demand... and GO!,1417392000,2,239,4.5813953488372094
8272631,4,B00198X0YU,I wanted to add that I am confused as to why no DVDs would be available for this show.  People want to purchase things legally.  Not making it available only encourages people to pirate.  Odd policy in the YouTube era.,1407369600,4,218,4.4
8272632,5,B00198X0YU,"This just shows you have corrupt the music industry is. It's not about the art or performance it's about the dollar, yen, deniro, euro, pound, peso, mark, franc, and anything else they can bleed out of people. I had a HD failure and lost 3 seasons.. so I figured no big deal, I'll just buy the DVDs. What a shock. What a disgrace.",1387497600,4,330,4.253968253968254
