5447130,5,B00AKIPAG6,"""Unconditional"", starring Lynn Collins, Michael Ealy, Gabriella Phillips, Kwesi Boakye, and Bruce McGill and directed by Brent McCorkle is a gem of a little independent film. I saw this movie twice in the theaters despite its too brief and very limited release back in September 2012, and it is such a satisfying and inspiring drama that I can't recommend it enough!

Lynn Collins plays Samantha Crawford, a successful author of children's stories, whose life is shattered when her husband is killed in a senseless violent mugging.  After more than two years of trying to deal with the crushing emotional loss and searching for clues pointing to the killer, Sam reaches the end of her hope and sets out to end her own life at the place her husband died... but is providentially stopped when she sees a young child struck by a car in the alley and is moved to help her.  From that point, Sam is reunited with Joe Bradford (Michael Ealy), an old childhood friend who looks after the young neighborhood kids, and she is drawn into his struggle to make better lives for the children growing up without the love and family bonds they all need to thrive.  In the children's own personal struggles that ensue, Joe's worsening physical condition, and several dramatic revelations that unfold around a suspected killer, eventually Sam rediscovers hope, unconditional love, and renewed purpose in living.  And ultimately the end brings Sam to the point of finally finding forgiveness and redemption for the one she blamed for the death of her husband.

Great drama, poignant and yet often laugh-out-loud humorous, this is a story of tender emotion with a real twist leading to the VERY satisfying end.  Based on and inspired by the true life events of Papa Joe Bradford and his ministry to neighborhood inner-city kids in need, this is an awesome story.  If you love drama, rent this movie.  I can almost guarantee you will end up buying it for your permanent DVD collection.",1357516800,350,1965,4.859281437125748

5447149,5,B00AKIPAG6,"What a pleasant surprise! I will admit that I came to this movie fearing that it would be one of those Christian-themed movies that I truly WANTED to like, but couldn't because of low budget, poor script, or mediocre acting (or all three). And I must say that early in the movie, I was afraid those fears would be accurate. I was so COMPLETELY wrong. The movie steadily gathers momentum, even providing some moments of high drama equal to the ""No! Don't go down in the basement!"" thoughts you have in some thrillers. All the actors are very good (young Kwesi Boakye is tremendous), the script takes you on some real twists and turns, and the ending is simply magnificent! You will not be sorry you bought this movie.",1521244800,,716,4.558139534883721

I saw the trailer and figured it was decent, and thank God it was actually on Prime and relatively inexpensive at seven bucks. Now that I've seen it, I can actually say that overall, it's an exceptional film and is so wrapped in emotion it's bound to touch the heart of anyone that has a heart.

5447188,5,B00AKIPAG6,"I found this movie to be extraordinary, beautiful on many levels.  It begins with Sam telling the story of ""Firebird,"" a little bird whose one question is ""What happened to the Sun?"" Which he asks every time it rains.  His mother usually states, ""One day you will understand,"" but during a terrible storm when he asks she instructs him to fly up through the storm and ""walk among the clouds.""  The movie does a better job at this than my retelling the story.  From that point on we learn a bit about her, how she became a successful writer, married a man she loved, and seemed to have it all.  When a storm overshadows her life she is tempted to end it all.  When a girl is hit by a car all thoughts of suicide are brushed away as she takes the girl, and her brother, to the hospital.  It is at the hospital that Sam runs into Joe, a childhood friend.  His love and compassion are truly riveting (and based on a true person).  Contrary to one reviewer the story is not fantasy.  Remember Firebird?  Just as that little bird had to go through the darkness and battle the wind, rain, and lightening before coming to know the truth about the Sun (it never left) so also does Sam have to weather her own storm and come to the realization that God has always been with her.  In the end Sam realizes that God has used even the darkest moments of her life to reach out to others through her husband, and that she was blessed by being reunited with her childhood friend who was making an impact on the children in the projects.  Someone who thinks this is fantasy needs to look at their own life and see if that isn't just what happened in their life when they accepted Jesus as Savior.  Haven't all of us gone through some storm or many storms, only to find that the Son has never left, and when the storm passes we find it is He who has given strength to us that we might bear up under the storm.  Romans 8:28 is not fantasy unless you are not living it.  Then it might seem fantasy, but if that's the case and you aren't living it then are you really a Christian?  God is looking for people who will allow Him to work in them every day of their life no matter where they are.  I find this one of the few movies deserving a 5 star rating.",1501804800,,2232,4.187353629976581

It is a beautiful reminder how each and everyone of us can be an everyday hero, an unsung hero just for the sake of giving of ourselves. Forgive me if I sound too sappy. It is how moved I am by the movie and this story.

It is also a wonderful way to reinforce the message to my boys that if each of us gives, no matter how little, we leave a positive imprint. Today our culture seems full of negativity (a ""gotch ya"" mentality, judgmental, finger pointing, etc.). This movie is one that clearly rises above despite one's circumstances. No matter who or what, absolutely no one escapes pain. The gift of pushing through the suffering and using it for good gives meaning to our pain.

It is an inspirational movie about love and being able to move on when bad things happen and you feel you have no hope and no desire to go on living.  Turning your focus to others and off your own situation can be an eye opening experience and can bring unexpected results.,1472947200,,343,4.276923076923077

It is a faith-based film that conveys the message of Christs unconditional love for us, and how our lives affect others when we demonstrate that same type of love for those around us. It is a good quality movie with a good message for people of various ages. The actors did a great job and the filmography was well done as well. I found it to be a beautiful movie, a moving film, and a well-scripted picture. Children will connect with the kids in the movie and they will enjoy the stories being told within the story (the main actress is a childrens author). Teenagers will find the mystery aspect of the film to be interesting. And adults will find beauty in the overall message of the movie.

5447608,5,B00AKIPAG6,"This is a truly great movie that is gripping on multiple levels. Before watching this movie I wasn't altogether sure that it sounded like something I'd want to see. But it was. :) The plot may be a bit hard to really describe, but what I can say is that you will almost guaranteed walk away from this movie feeling inspired, encouraged, and hopeful. It is very engaging and moving.

It is loosely based on / inspired by the true real life story of ""Papa Joe"" Bradford, who ministers to low-income children in Tennessee, but this film is NOT a biography. In fact, the film's central-most character isn't even him, but rather a woman who was his childhood friend and ""providentially"" gets reunited with him.

This is a well-made, well-acted film, and honestly as I was watching it, I was surprised that it really wasn't pushed more in the movie theaters as it's general enough that I would think even non-Christian audiences could truly enjoy it. It seems to be relegated to the home video market and even then is only available on DVD (not Blu-ray). I don't really get it.

This film is a bit ""grittier"" than the average Christian film tends to be. It's rated PG-13 mostly because of some violence and portrayal of inner-city life realities. I didn't notice any bad language and there's no sexual content. And even the violence is relatively tame all things considered (there also isn't that much of it). But due to the violence and some of the more mature themes, I agree with the rating and recommend avoiding showing to those under age 13.

Key themes in the movie include: moving on from your past - including moving forward out of deep grief, forgiveness, importance of fathers, truly making a difference by sharing love unconditionally, and that God is always with us and His love is constant.

One of the things I most love about this movie is that it avoided a common trap that too many other Christian films have fallen into - that is taking the evil we see in our world and somehow attributing those things to God (or otherwise raising questions about God's goodness). There's hard realities shown in this movie, for sure, but it mostly (there's one relatively minor exception) keeps God in a positive light in that He is always with us and His love is constant towards us even in the hard things. It doesn't fall into the trap of feeling like it needs to try to explain in 3-word sound-bytes why there's evil in this world, which is something I greatly appreciate after having seen other Christian movies raise serious questions of God's goodness and then not adequately resolving those questions.

Additionally, the plot had a number of twists that I never saw coming - a very refreshing trait in an age where most films are so predictable.

But anyway: This film is very encouraging for those who are going through difficult life stages. I first saw this film when I rented it from a box that was red, and as soon as it ended I knew that I had to have it! So I purchased it from Amazon the next day!

Concerning shipping: Despite being a prime member I find that I very rarely get actual 2 day shipping, it normally takes 3 to 4 days for items to arrive and this item was late also. But it did arrive in good condition and it worked fine.

But it conveys the true story of Joe Bradford's service to the world as something anyone could do in their own real world, so perhaps I should not be so critical of the fabricated part! ~ Pressed for time, I showed it without previewing to a group of prisoners and it was a huge success! The story has a strong Christian message of changed lives, and also delivers a powerful rebuke to racism. ~ My own volunteer work in prison is negatively affected by the racism that keeps people 'of their own kinds' separate.

5447677,3,B00AKIPAG6,"its most important point is lost due to the fact it is critical to be politically correct?  Or at least that is how it appeared to me.

There are certain stories told in music, books and movies that touch you deeply.  This story is one of those instances.  Samantha ""Sam"" Crawford is a mess, still grieving from the loss of her husband, who was murdered by an unknown assailant in the projects.  She returns to the place where it happens and witnesses a young girl being hit by a speeding car and left for dead.  She takes her to the hospital and while awaiting an update sees Joe Bradford, a close childhood friend, who comes to get the girl.

Sam visits the neighborhood to follow-up on the girl's recovery and ends up reconnecting with Joe.  He tells her of his life since they lost contact, which included a stint in prison and his life changing experience.  Now disabled because of kidney failure, he has become the adoptive father to the neighborhood children, few of whom have a father.  Through the witness of Joe's commitment to the children and his encouragement, she realizes she must forgive the murderer and move forward.  Sam believes she has located the murderer.  However, as she struggles with taking the law into her own hands, the situation rapidly shifts.  I don't want to spoil the ending, so I will state that this story is told to create tension and suspense but things aren't always as they seem.  There are more subplots in the story than what I am summarizing.

The great downfall is the telling of Joe's experience in understanding God's love while doing time in solitary confinement.  The movie doesn't develop this experience in any depth though it is critical to the storyline.  Nor do we even have a certainty that his experience is with the Judeo-Christian God, since I guess the producers and/or director wanted to be Politically Correct.  All we know observe while he talks to Sam about serving in solitary confinement, is him sitting on his bed and he appears to be meditating? praying? next, we see a bright light shining in the room, he states as we view the ""light"" that his view of life has changed. I guess those who would be ""offended"" by this part of the story would jeopardize the ability to get theaters to carry it or the number of tickets sold.

What a loss, since both Sam and Joe have powerful personal experiences with significant loss and wounds that result.  Their childhood stories were insightful and emotionally packed as the bond they shared allowed them both to grow further as adults and share a level of trust to encourage each to grow beyond their pain.  I cried because they realized that the power of love (agape) based on choice (which reflects God's love based on acceptance and not on behavior/works) and not on emotion/reactive feelings, which often drives our behavior.  Actions including forgiveness is a choice not a feeling.  Sam and Joe's reactions are incredible messages about choice as it relates forgiveness and life purpose that anyone could relate to in their own life.  Both are amazing people because of their response to their pain.

Thus, in my opinion, the potential impact this could have made was watered down.  Don't let that stop you from watching the movie, however, be prepared to know that this isn't a movie, you would give to a person, who doesn't understand God's perfect, unconditional love.",1398816000,3,3383,4.74017094017094
5447678,5,B00AKIPAG6,This is a wonderful movie.  Not much that would benefit you if you aren't interested in faith and facts.  A heart moving movie that if we all could attain to its value we'd live in a much better world.,1398729600,,201,4.128205128205129

5447681,1,B00AKIPAG6,"Rarely have I been so disappointed with a movie, but I confess my standards are high, & my expectations were as well, on account of the recommendation. I was told by a born-again believer that this was the ""best Christian movie"" he had ever seen. Now, to be fair, he is a filmmaker, so I am guessing he watches a lot of films from all genres just for his craft. Compared to most Hollywood movies, this is one of the more savory ones. But, sadly, it is not Christian, & the insidiousness of the humanist message it carries makes it almost more dangerous than a movie you could readily identify as outright evil.

The name above all other names, the only name under which we can receive salvation, is never mentioned in this movie. I kept waiting to hear my Lord's name proclaimed as the cause for the grace in which our protagonist's opposite was abiding. Never happened. It was some force called ""God"" that somehow did something for him & in which the protagonist (perhaps) regains faith by the end of the movie, but I can't say even that with certainty.

To be clear, in English that name is Jesus Christ. Believe on Him with your whole heart, & you will be saved for eternity. You will be a new creature. If you want to understand this more, leave a comment, & I will communicate further with you.

The acting, directing, & cinematography was good for the most part, from the viewpoint of an amateur such as myself. I liked the characters, I cared about our main lady, gent, & kids. I so wanted them to find the Lord, so we could all celebrate! I enjoyed the idea of the story-line & where I thought it was going. It just never got there.

Universalists will love this film (for the theme anyway, personal film tastes aside). Humanists will adore it. Atheists need only squirm for maybe 60 total seconds of the movie.

But people who passionately love & follow the Lord Jesus Christ & yearn for salvation for as many people as possible & glory in His glory may find themselves distraught at this movie.  At least that was the case with me & my crew.

The messages of this movie:
* There is some kind of God somewhere who does something for some people somehow.
* It's not necessary to share who that God is with people in order for them to have a good life.
* What IS necessary is some mysterious force called LOVE which comes from we know not where. Inside us, maybe?
* THAT force is what really matters.
* Also, helping out those less fortunate than we in charitable fashion.
* Best part: you can infuse two-dollar bills (or whatever you want) with aforementioned LOVE & pass them out to people as a symbol to help spread that LOVE around.

This last bullet point is witchcraft, pure & simple. As a former Wiccan priestess of many, many years, I say this with absolute authority. It's witchcraft, & it paves the road to hell. Please, please don't believe it. Love as an impersonal force will not save you. Only the Author of love, only the One who IS love can do that.

God bless you, & may you find your way to Him quickly.",1398384000,14,3028,4.392857142857143

5447695,5,B00AKIPAG6,"Unconditional is based on a true story. Right away, I saw the landscaping and said: ""That's Nashville!"" I did a little poking around the net and found out it was filmed in Nashville and surrounding areas. If you're from around here, you can tell from the landscape and style of housing, even in the inner-city housing.

About the story: according to Wikipedia, it's loosely based don the life of Papa Joe, Joe Bradford. The movie is moving, sometimes sappy, but no part of the movie, IMO, is inappropriate for children. I prefer not to have my kids see kissing scenes, there's several of that in the movie, but other than that. NO PROFANITY, NO SEX in the movie. That's weird. This obviously wasn't a Hollywood movie project.

The movie is very enjoyable and appeals to men, women, boys, and girls. It's got suspense, action, drama, emotion. Yea, it's over the top in some places, but isn't any theater? I give it 5 stars.",1395446400,,922,4.6503067484662575

I love these kinds of films and I think the independent film makers, stars, writers & directors need to start making a lot more of this caliber of film for family viewing.

5447741,1,B00AKIPAG6,"""Unconditional"" is an incredibly moving film. It reminded me in several spots of ""Pay It Forward."" The story packs so many emotional scenes and so much drama that I'm tempted to call it manipulative; but I suppose to be fair, every film is ""manipulating"" the viewer in some way. That's the whole point - delivering messages and endeavoring to elicit an emotional response of some kind from the viewer. So again, this film is powerful. The scenes have been put together very well. The directing is strong. The music is fitting and excellent. The acting, especially by the two main characters (Joe and Sam, played by Michael Ealy and Lynn Collins respectively), is really well done. Collins is particularly good.

This film bears no Christian labels (of which I'm aware), which is no surprise since Jesus is never mentioned in it. Nevertheless, it seems to masquerade as a Christian film, so I intend to address it from a Christian perspective. (As a Christian, I can't address it from any other perspective anyway.) The story is compelling, even if far-fetched in a few spots. Unfortunately, like the children's stories Sam writes, the message of this film is fantasy. What I mean by that is it is heartbreakingly incomplete. The deep messages that come out of the film are these:

1. God loves you.
2. You just need to realize it and accept it, and it will change your life.

I agree with the first message. God indeed loves everyone. I do not agree with the second message. If we're going to talk about God, then we need to go to the authority on God, which is His Word, the Bible. Looking at the totality of scripture, it is blatantly obvious that the purpose of this brief, human existence is to make sure you enter into eternal life when you leave life here. The Bible is quite clear as to how a person does this. In John 17:3, Jesus said, ""This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."" So there's something very important about knowing Jesus Christ. In John 3, Jesus said, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."" And lastly, Romans 10:9 says, ""If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.""

The Bible is extremely clear then that entering into eternal life (""going to heaven"" or ""being saved,"" etc.) requires knowing Jesus Christ, being born again, and making Jesus lord. All of these things have their roots in faith, believing things God has revealed to us. ""Unconditional"" doesn't say anything about being born again or about making Jesus lord. However, the film tells us that knowing God just happens if we seek Him. While this can indeed occur, what is missing throughout this film is the most critical piece: Jesus Christ. God has chosen to reveal Himself through His Son (Hebrews 1:1-4). He has chosen to make salvation available only through His Son (John 14:6, Acts 4:11-12). The fact that God loves you is not enough for you to enter eternal life. For a person to realize and accept God's love for them is not enough to enter eternal life. A person must be born again in order to receive the free gift of eternal life.

There was a time in my life that I didn't want to live. I never found myself in a rainy alley with a loaded gun under my chin, but I relate to Sam's pain. And as in the film, God's providence placed individuals in my life who told me of His love and pointed me in a new direction. I sought after God for a year and a half, and I managed to change my life in some positive ways. Some of the pain of my past seemed to fade away. However, time and good works and intentions do not heal wounds. They may seem to heal, but they merely submerge in our souls, only to pop back up to surprise us by their enduring strength. Only Jesus Christ heals wounds of the human soul. Only Jesus liberates people from the bondage known as sin. Jesus said that ""everyone who sins is a slave to sin"" (John 8:34), and He effectively covered all mankind with that statement. Sin is without question mankind's greatest problem, and in sending Jesus Christ to set people free from sin, God has met humanity's greatest need. That is the very height of love. When I finally surrendered my life fully to Jesus Christ (made Him lord), believing in all He had done for me, I was born again. I was set free from the penalty for my sin (hell) and from the power of my sin to control my life. From that day, my life has never been the same. I received the free gift of eternal life. I entered God's kingdom (Colossians 1:13-14).

That is the message of hope which is grievously missing from ""Unconditional."" Helping a stranger is noble. Feeding, clothing, and educating at-risk children is noble too and can bring about some positive change in the world, at least in the eyes of man. But from God's perspective, if the name of God's salvation, Jesus Christ, the Hope of all mankind, is never mentioned; all that happens is helped, fed, clothed, and educated people never learn the way of salvation and go to hell. If all we do as Christians is meet people's earthly, temporary needs, we have failed. If all we do is tell people that God loves them and will change their lives if they will accept His love, we have failed. We have failed them and God. Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, the exact representation of the Father (Hebrews 1:3), said, ""You must be born again"" (John 3:7). Does anyone have the right to change what God has decreed? No matter how moving it may be, is ""Unconditional"" a great film if it changes the good news of Jesus Christ? If it omits the good news of Jesus Christ? No. This film is hard for me to dislike because it has such potential. It could have been monumental in its impact for Christ and eternity. Instead, it falls short. Rather than leading people to eternal life, ""Unconditional"" deceives people and will likely comfort many with false hope, while they continue on a path toward hell. This is a lamentable summary of the film, but it is factual, and it is frighteningly common today.

Given the quality of the film's production and the power of its messages (which will draw people into error), I advise against watching it due to the grievous omission of the saving gospel of Jesus Christ.",1385683200,57,6321,4.50566695727986

The potential is certainly there to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ into the plotline, but God is thrown in a few times, with no mention of Jesus.

5447752,5,B00AKIPAG6,"Someone who gave this movie just 2 stars wrote:'The movie is designed to give you a warm and fuzzy feeling.' Well, actually that happened too, but my overal feelings were quite different because of the way the filmmakers made it possible to relate to Sam, who lost her husband to murder and was left with the maddening questions 'why?' 'who?' and 'how now?' I cried some of my own pain out over this broken world. I guess I needed a good cry. And don't you start making fun of my pain, cause you know nothing about it.
Since it is based on a true story, I guess the 'candy coat' that writer saw in it, was earned through many hardships. That doesn't make them any lighter. But at least someone had the guts and power to at least try to overcome the bitterness, that is so often the only result.
So no, I do not agree with that review. But do wish that 'old cynic', as he called himself, could cry out his own pain better.

My review? This movie touched me somewhere deep, deep down and brought some of the issues up, that caused me to struggle in life. And through my tears I could also grasp some of that hope and faith. There are not many films that can do that! So I am deeply impressed with this piece of art. And thank the makers for allowing us a glimpse in their hearts. If you can't grasp that, I'm truly sorry for you. Luckily most people can, if you're reading the grades they give this film.

By the way: I'm glad I didn't watch this with others, because now it could do its work in me. And I don't think it is suitable for kids under twelve for A) they probably cannot grasp this film, so they'll might think it boring and B) if they can grasp it, that probably has something to do with their own traumatic experiences and might in this age cause more pain. But smart kids will have left the room by then.
To everyone over twelve: just relate to one of the characters and sort things out for yourselves. Turning pain into gain isn't cheap. It is a worthy cause, that needs more everyday-heroes. Maybe you are to be one of them too?

Something weird happened while commenting on the review of that other guy. He didn't appreciate it much. He wrote me back that Sam's husband hat trusted God, and still he died. And how very sad that indeed is, I reminded him of Sam's husband's last words, that he would be walking on the clouds! Such hope lives inside of us. And so I encouraged this review-writer to make heaven his destiny too. Jesus paid for the sins of mankind on that cross. His answer was that I belonged in hell!!!!!
Then he removed his review so that I could not reply on that anymore. So for the small chance he is still checking me out, here follows the comment I made on that, but could never post:

""Hi, wanted to reply on your comment and saw you changed the number of stars from 2 to 1. You really make me laugh. Thank you.
You wrote to me that I belong in hell. Yes, you are very right. So do you. So does all mankind.
The question is: do you want to go?
I don't. And guess what: I know a way out. Sam's husband knew it too. And I guess you know exactly what I mean. Yours for the taking...

I would really love to see you there. In heaven I mean. Cause I'm definetely not going to hell. Thanks to... You know WHOM. I made 'reservations' when I was just 17 years old and hopelessly distressed with the way the world is nowadays. So loveless, don't you agree? Hell is supposed to be even worse. Sadly you do not even have to make reservations to go there. It's all prepared for us.
You really want to go there? It's not meant for you, but for the fallen angels who deceive mankind, lying about God and His great love for us.
God will really bless you, cause I'm praying for you. And know what, even if you do not believe me, I like you. You fight for the cause. I would pick another cause, but that doesn't change that I really appreciate your dedication. Have you ever heard about a guy named Saul? He didn't like them stupid Christians or their God either. But then he met Jesus. Boy, did that change something. We know him now as the apostle Paul, serving us originally-hell-go-ers with the strong love of God. God loves you more, than you can ever hate or despise Him. He proved it... on that nasty cross. He loves you so much! You bring a smile to His face too. He can even cure the old cynics among us.

God bless you. Really. With love.""",1383264000,,4370,4.21505376344086

But I put my laptop away five minutes into the film and watched the movie.  I was taken in by each and every character.  I wanted to know them.  I felt for them, and then I realized that God has a purpose for all of us...After the movie, I sought online for the book about the Firebird.  It's out there.  I need to get one because this movie, the people in it - Joe Bradford and Sam Crawford - remind me that God is there to help us with the purpose He gave us.  Thank you for a great film.

5447784,5,B00AKIPAG6,"""Unconditional"" was a well done, most inspiring movie. There are still loving people involved a positive way in other people's lives. From the little white girl who befriended a lonely black boy in the face of bullies, to the whiskey guzzling neighbor who took in two children so they would not have to be put in foster homes, to the movie's main character who provides a place for inner city children to hang out after school, to the lady who let the children visit her farm the movie is so sweet.

We don't appreciate the usual Hollywood menu of zombies and horror, so this film was a refreshing release from the hopelessness being packaged by media moguls in Los Angeles.  It deals with racial profiling, quick judgments which are not always accurate and emotional healing from traumatic occurrences.  Very powerful acting and a strong portrait of the resilience of children in low income communities if someone will just take a step forward.",1371168000,2,496,5.333333333333333

5447822,5,B00AKIPAG6,"I don't buy too many DVDs but when I do, it means something (to me). I recommend this movie for all! It's pretty much a PG movie. Just a brief scene of a gun shot but other than that, it's clean, relatable, and viewable to all ages. It's a very touching and meaningful movie that moved me to donate to Elijah's Heart (Papa Joe's non-profit foundation). A lot of it is true regarding Joe Bradford's life. I did weep a few times during the movie so a tissue is needed. I cried again the 2nd time I watched it.

I know that this was a small budget film but I really wish it got much more attention and was highly promoted. After watching it, I told several people about it and I rarely do that. So this shows how much the movie moved me. Also, Michael Ealy and Lynn Collins did a fantastic job in playing their role.

And I cannot end this review without saying that Michael Ealy is a very attractive, delicious man. Hmmmm hmm hmmm!!

It speaks to many different issues and challenges that we face as a socieity - race, relationships, prejudice, love, forgiveness, faith... It's all there.  I don't believe this is technically a Christian movie, but I recommend it to every believer.  Everyone in the family can watch, enjoy and grow.

This is a great movie. I mean this is very worth the money and it should have been in theaters.

5447843,4,B00AKIPAG6,"I think this film is a very good example of it's genre.  I don't care for most faith-based films because too often I think they emphasize the spiritual over the material and the characters, they don't let you really get inside them first and understand their strengths and weaknesses so that their journey becomes yours.  That, or they explain God's love rather than showing an example of human love that informs us of the greater power of God's love. Put another way, I think when you start preaching to the audience in a film, it kicks the audience out of the film, rather than involving the audience so thoroughly with the characters and situations they forget they're being reminded of something basic about kindness.

What did I like about this film?  Michael Ealy's performance.  He's outstanding.  I have a strong bias in favor of Lynn Collins  so I can't report accurately on her performance.  She's good with what she has to work with, though I think her character is a little hamstrung by the narrative of her wanting to track down the man who murdered her husband. It's not badly done, but the hot or hysterical emotions that come with pulling a gun don't seem to 'fit' with her character... maybe I'm reading too much into it. I would've liked a scene where she expressed to Joe her anger at her incomprehensible loss. That aside? The payoff of her journey to me was worthwhile, and I was so engrossed with it that the spiritual punchline caught me off guard, like I mentioned earlier.

I liked that the film emphasized the importance of community outreach, of the need for good father figures, of the tragic loss of the same. That it related finding God's love in the worst circumstances.  I liked that the child actors in the film had some depth to their characters, particularly the boy named Macon, he pulled a terrific surprise tear-jerker moment that knocked me out.

I liked it. It was simple, emotionally affecting and had an honest message about helping the poor. I think it succeeds in what it was trying to do.",1369094400,76,2033,4.666666666666667

5447866,3,B00AKIPAG6,"Sam  (Lynn Collins) lost her husband to a senseless crime and she felt like she could not go on. Her despair led her to a place where she was a great help to someone and she was also reunited with a childhood friend.

Joe (Michael Ealy) is a caring man - a father figure to the children in ""The Commons"" without fathers, doing his part to help them 'defy the odds'.

There are films that show in theaters but seem more like made-for-TV movies, and this is one of them. That's not to say Unconditional isn't a movie worth watching; good acting, touching moments. It's a good movie with quite a few flashbacks that told Sam and Joe's stories more than what was happening in the present.

There is not a strong presentation of the Gospel here so,don't expect it to be an evangelism tool but it is VERY enjoyable.  It will make a great gift!  This company has a few other films that look to be great quality faith films also.  I'm looking forward to seeing other releases from them in the future!

Semi-Spoiler: As you may already be aware, this is a Christian film based partly on the life and work of ""Papa Joe"" Bradford, a former convict who founded a special program for ""at risk"" children in Nashville, Tennessee. While there is a definite religious agenda here, it is not too preachy and avoids promoting any specific church or creed.

The main reason why I give this as high a rating as I do is that the story of Samantha Crawford's search for her husband's murderer is quite riveting in places; there are some truly suspenseful and surprising moments here. Most of the acting is quite good, as is the cinematography, which shows some really captivating shots of storm clouds, waterfalls, and the like, as well as realistic filming of inner-city Nashville.

Still, the plot is all over the place, and the stories of Samantha and her childhood friend Joe do not intertwine quite as well as they could. The pervasive schmaltzy soundtrack is distracting and seems a bit too intent on telling us how to feel about this and that. This entire film would have worked so much better if there had been more focus on simply relating the stories without trying to manipulate the audience's moods and perceptions. While, to its credit, the central Christian message keeps itself out of the film until toward the end, UNCONDITIONAL always seems to be on the verge of making some heavy-handed moral. The time-frame is also unclear; e.g., Bradford goes to prison for computer hacking, where they still play phonograph records (?)

While the film tries to be grittily realistic in places, the final effect is  sugar-coated, i.e., ""We can show bloody murder, inner-city life in the 'projects,' and prison brawls, but _please_, no f-bombs, sexual references, or any of that type of stuff!!"" The dialogue is probably the most problematical element here. The creators were obviously trying to avoid an ""R"" rating, but this could have been better accomplished by simply having less (or at least less audible) dialogue in the rougher spots.

Such is also the case with the ludicrously fake prison-yard fight scene. In the Special Features, one of the directors states that the actual fight that occurred during Joe Bradford's incarceration was ""much more brutal than we could show on film."" That being the case, it would have been more effective to just show the whole thing summarily and/or hazily, allowing the audience to tell what's going on without having to see it in graphic detail.

All the same, UNCONDITIONAL has many fine moments. The children (and theme of childhood in general) are particularly great in every respect.",1362528000,9,2631,4.9389140271493215
5447930,5,B00AKIPAG6,"It's great to see such a well-done Christian movie. Great story-line, acting and directing. It's not overly preachy or condemning so it won't offend non-Christian friends during movie night, and even my teen sons loved it.",1362441600,18,222,5.194444444444445
5447931,5,B00AKIPAG6,"As I mentioned before, this movie changed my life and I love it passionatly.  I love movies and without a doubt this movie is life changing.  Don't believe me?  Buy it and watch it!",1362441600,15,181,4.264705882352941
5447932,5,B00AKIPAG6,"This movie was simply amazing. I am usually weary of Christian films because of the bad acting but this is not the case for Unconditional. It challenges us to break biases, be bold, and to reach out the community in need around us. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more challenging.",1361750400,11,307,4.310344827586207
5447933,5,B00AKIPAG6,"I have been eagerly waiting for the DVD release of Unconditional since it was released in theaters, no where near us, last fall. Tuesday, while forced to spend the afternoon in bed, I used the opportunity to preview it with Elisabeth.  I've got to tell you, I was not disappointed one bit.  Papa Joe Bradford took an incredible God-given vision and in the face of much adversity he carried it out in a way that is inspiring to all. The writers, directors and actors do a superb job of telling his story.  In 98 minutes they touched on many topics relevant to the Christian life.  I personally came away with ministry ideas for myself, my family, and our church.

And it was entertaining, too.  This movie will surely make you laugh and cry.  But, hopefully it won't stop there.  I pray it will create a stirring in you to rise up, find a vision and get busy showing the unconditional love of our God and reaching the next generation with the gospel of Jesus.

One word of caution.  There are several scenes that may be upsetting to young children.  Elisabeth ran out of the room at least three times.  I suggest previewing this before watching it with your children.  With that being said, I can't wait until my copy of the DVD arrives so I can share it with the family.
