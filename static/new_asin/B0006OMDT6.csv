I do as much as I can and figured that I will get better at it with time.",1352073600,,248,3.730769230769231
8042081,3,B0006OMDT6,Different but good moves and you can work up quite a sweat if you can keep up with the routine.,1337904000,,95,3.8
8042082,5,B0006OMDT6,"This is the only Masala Workout DVD that I own and I love the workout.  I really do start sweating by the end of the warm up and get a great workout from the strength training.  They are also easy to do at home and with kids. My son does not use the weights for the strength training but still enjoys to do all of the moves with me..  I highly recommend this DVD for those that are looking for a solid, basic strength training routine.  I feel great each and every time that I use it.",1175040000,5,484,3.9587628865979383
8042083,5,B0006OMDT6,I borrowed this DVD from a neighbor.  I enjoyed it so much I ordered my own copy.  Its a good total body workout that begins with a bhangra dance warm-up then proceeds through resistance training for all the major muscle groups.,1156377600,7,228,4.536585365853658
8042084,2,B0006OMDT6,"I am a huge fan of Sarina Jain's DVD series: I owned them all and ended up selling  #1 and #4. I practiced this # 4 DVD once only,outside of the music,there is nothing to differentiate it from any  other strength training DVD.I wrongly thought that this DVD would include a 20 mns minimum cardio session with brand new moves. There is a 10 mn/warm up dance routine with the famous "" basic "" step and steps that you already know from the previous DVDs in the series. By that time, you are sick and tired of the "" basic "" step since you have been practicing it in the previous DVDs. This is the major drawback of Sarina Jain's DVD series, the tedious repetition of the "" basic "" step. I would suggest anyone wanting to purchase this DVD to save the money and invest in DVD #2 or #3 and to buy a bhangra music c.d to do their regular strength training routine on.",1114041600,60,860,4.174698795180723
