This 1941 movie was made during Ann Miller's tenure with Columbia Pictures, where she established herself as ""The Queen Of The B's"" (B pictures, that is). It is one of several Western-themed movies that Annie made during her career, including Gene Autry's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melody-Ranch/dp/B00000JKXZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melody Ranch</a>&nbsp;(Republic Pictures, 1940) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Texas-Carnival/dp/B0062Z0PF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Texas Carnival</a>&nbsp;(MGM, 1951), both of which I own and enjoy.

GO WEST, YOUNG LADY is a very entertaining B-Western where Annie plays Lola, a saloon dancer. It features two Miller tap routines - in the first one, Annie tap-dances, in part, on top of a bar, in cowboy boots; the second is a number called ""I Wish That I Could Be A Singing Cowboy,"" where Annie taps alongside Allen Jenkins, a somewhat reluctant male cowboy partner, and gently persuades him to be a dancing cowboy instead. Other entertaining scenes include the cat fight between Annie and Penny Singleton (best known as Blondie and the voice of Jane Jetson). Penny also has a song-and-tap routine of her own, though it's not as good as Annie's two numbers. The movie also stars Glenn Ford (who was married for 15 years to Hollywood's other great female tapper, Eleanor Powell) as Sheriff Tex Miller, and features a musical number by Bob Wills And His Texas Playboys.

This is the fourth movie that I have purchased from Loving The Classics, either through an Amazon Merchant or from their Web site.

LTC did a much better job on GO WEST, YOUNG LADY than on the other three; there is no extraneous footage from other pictures, and the picture and sound quality, while not as good as an official Sony DVD, or even a getTV or Antenna TV broadcast, is quite satisfactory. But I still hold out hope for an official issue someday, either through Warner Archives' Columbia Classics, or Sony's own Choice Collection.",1405382400,,3113,7.018041237113402
