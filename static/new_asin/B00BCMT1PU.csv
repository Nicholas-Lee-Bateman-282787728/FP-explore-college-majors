5578119,5,B00BCMT1PU,"So much of our wildlife is under siege, but the situation is particularly dire in case of elephants and rhinos.  This documentary is so timely in bringing attention to the plight of these magnificent and intelligent animals who are being massacred.  The biggest demand comes from China, and it's truly alarming when we calculate the growing demand from their ever-increasing middle class.  It's heartbreaking especially to hear the callous comments and willful ignorance of Chinese sellers and consumers. One collector even says that elephants should appreciate being commemorated in such art form. Really? These magnificent creatures have to die and become extinct so we humans can enjoy a few trinkets? Aren't we better than that?  I urge everyone to watch and take action.  Otherwise, we might be the last generation to see elephants in the wild.",1362528000,10,849,5.213235294117647

8566069,1,B00BCMT1PU,"To understand these gentle giants watch the emotional and heartbreaking documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Echo-An-Elephant-to-Remember/dp/B00443FMHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Echo: An Elephant to Remember</a>. Between 2009 and 2014, organized criminal Networks moved an estimated 170 tons of ivory, the yield of quarter million dead elephants. Every twenty minutes an elephant is killed to feed an insatiable demand for ivory by criminals that terrorize Africa. African elephants WILL be gone in as little as ten years. To understand what these gentle giants future is headed toward, watch the painful documentary called ILLICIT IVORY by EARTH FOCUS and you will see the real equation of crime for profit by criminals in Africa and then you will really feel the reality, the pain that a specie can become extinct just for the money that it can bring to these criminals.

As far as this documentary is concern, watch this documentary since you will see ivory sculptures and masterpieces in millions of dollars apiece unlike any ARTWORK that you can imagine, what finished ivory may look like in the hands of a Chinese artist. Absolutely unbelievable. By 1913, America was consuming 200 tons of ivory per year and Africa's elephants had dropped to an estimated 10 million. By 1979 only 1.3 million elephants were left and that number shrunk to only 600,000 by 1989. Killing 30,000 elephants a year for what... To Chinese, ivory statutes mean; god of money, good luck, prosperity, long life, happiness, tradition, status, power...  Since Chinese are able to afford ivory for the first time in generations and they look for a symbol with core values, then ivory expresses such value that associates with their ancestors. Saving Africa's Giants documentary with Yao Ming is a testament to how caring an individual can become in a group of uncaring people like Chinese in order to communicate the message to stop slaughtering those elephants for their tusks in his country regardless of hypocrites like Xue Ping, the wealthy Chinese businessman who proudly showed off his collection of ivory statutes in the name of Buddha. After all that is what all criminals do, justifying their acts in name of some religious cause. Chinese are the same who have done everything to kill the Tibetan's culture, tradition and religion so no surprise there but what is disturbing about this documentary is that the producers never ever approached other criminals. NY and CA have the highest traffic of illegal ivory but the producers failed to address that part of the world but yet they happily interviewed and identified in the videos the government officials of a poor country as well as a small time dealer who most likely has left planet earth after release of this documentary.

Deduct four stars for the ignorance of the producers for addressing the symptoms but not the real players involved in the cause. California will not even pass a ban on ivory trading for good. Sales of ivory made before 1989 are legal in California so it's very hard to tell old from new, hence the US is as guilty as China even though US may happen to be the largest consumer of ivory after China. Even one Chinese official in Switzerland admitted on video that China is not the only supporter in the art of killing elephants for their tusks but yet the producers of this film comfortably forgot to address the US fact since they know real well who pays their bills. Bryan Christy and journalist Aidan Hartley sincerely did not use their knowledge of fair reporting in exposing all the major criminals in supporting the white gold trading but yet they certainly were eager in busting a small time dealer somewhere in Tanzania who most likely is in one spirit with those dead elephants somewhere away from this Blue Planet. Shame, shame, shame.",1429574400,2,3860,5.114104595879557
