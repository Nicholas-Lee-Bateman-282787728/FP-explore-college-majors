7672696,4,B01C6S1Z2K,"This is a review of the Quality of the Disk itself. I will not write a review here of the show it's self. I'm Biased because I LOVE - Love Stage! .The packaging is a basic standard DVD case. With a DVD on each side. Fits well in case to avoid damage. Disks do not skip and do play well. Same quality I get from DVD's ordered direct from manufacturer. Did have some extras. Some promo spots that were FUN, and Character Bumpers (information pages). The video is in Japanese with English subtitles. Looks the same as when I watch it on Line. Disks have ""printed"" photos and info on each one. These do not look like they came from someones computer. Very professionally done. The cover on the case is the same. Professionally done. I know sometimes I get Anime and it looks like someone printed a cover from their pc and the disks look like the kind I buy at the store - NOT SO on these. I assume they are professionally printed.

So if your a Love Stage Fan - or just wanting to check out a great Anime. This DVD is a Great Buy!",1473811200,4,1026,4.181818181818182
7672697,5,B01C6S1Z2K,The anime is so cute but I am sad there is only 10 episodes and a ova. Overall a anime worth watching!!!!,1472688000,,105,3.8181818181818183
7672698,5,B01C6S1Z2K,I'm glad there's an anime version of this cute series!:),1470700800,,56,4.7
7672699,5,B01C6S1Z2K,Such a great anime with comedic relief. Five Stars for sure!!,1469923200,,61,4.636363636363637
7672700,5,B01C6S1Z2K,This is my favorite anime and manga series currently. All of the characters are so likeable and you find yourself really rooting for Izumi and Ryouma to end up together.,1468540800,,169,4.666666666666667
7672701,5,B01C6S1Z2K,"I couldn't wait to find out how this would turn out after watching the first episode. Nothing could tear me away from my TV until I found out if Izumi would accept Ryouma's feelings or even acknowledge his own. Watching his older brother interact with both of them only made it better. It's a great watch to see how something special can develop from a pure interaction. I kind of want to watch it again. And not just to see Ryouma be thwarted by that pole countless times while he deals with his feelings. Hope you enjoy!

 Oh and if the title doesn't make it clear enough,  if you don't like yaoi, don't bother Watching. Even if they cleverly avoid showing anything, you know what's going on and details are discussed. You shouldn't be here.",1468454400,3,743,4.488888888888889
7672702,4,B01C6S1Z2K,"Just finished watching ""Love Stage!!"" released by Sentai Filmworks.
PRUDE ALERT - This is a yaoi [m/m] anime that a dear friend of mine suggested that I watch, so I decided to see why she was reminded of someone who fell in love with me in college.  I am revealing a bit of my sordid past here...LOL...but don't worry, I was also boring then too...LOL...
When my friend Lynn casually mentioned that she was reminded of how a young Japanese man named Xan who used to stalk me around the campus of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville during my entire four years there as a physics major when she snippets of this anime; I knew that I had to get it once I stopped laughing so hard that I collapsed on the floor.
Let me explain:  I first encountered Xan when I was grabbing a bite of dinner at one of the student cafeterias before attending the evening lab session of my Astronomy Honors class back in September 1980.  At this time I was staying with my Grandparents; and do keep in mind that I was a bit, shall we say, naive when it came to understanding that someone - a guy - was hitting on me.  Xan sat down across from me, introduced himself, and started complimenting me.  I engaged in casual small talk and excused myself.  Guess who was waiting for me after my lab was done for the wee?  You guessed it, Xan.  I made use of a side exit.
So when was taking Japanese language, I happened to mention to Lynn about my gay stalker.  Lynn promptly informed me that I was wrong, that ""Japanese men aren't that way,"" and I was completely, completely misinterpreting an innocent man's intention because all he wanted was to be my friend and not get into my pants.
Fate did intervene to show Lynn the errors of her ways.  One day, she decided that we should all go to a popular snack shop off campus and practice our Japanese out in public.  Guess who immediately sat at my table when he walked into the door!  Yep, you guessed it - Xan!  Guess who asked me out on a date right in front of Lynn.  Yep, you guessed it, Xan! Guess who told Xan off in no uncertain terms!  Yep, you guessed it, Lynn!
Thankfully I didn't see much of Xan after that.  He stopped stalking me for the most part.  I think Lynn embarrassed him - in her defense, it was the 1980s and she told him off in Japanese.  I still think it was funny that she had never believed me until that particular moment..  And in all honesty, I was very much relieved that he had, for the most part, stopped stalking me.
So when Lynn mentioned seeing bits and pieces of this yaoi anime and that the character of Ryoma Ichijo reminded her of Xan, I knew I had to watch this 10-episode series.that she had seen while visiting Japan.
[Jeff H. here:  Bear in mind that ever since stroke #2, Joseph has had extreme difficulty speaking Japanese, French, Spanish - the languages he learned when he was younger.  Watching him though listen to and translate Japanese and French into spoken English is really creepy because his face and eyes go completely blank and that has completely freaked me out on more than one occasion.]
Note:  Jeff H. did not watch any part of ""Love Stage!!"" with me.
Love Stage!! tells the tale of former child actor Izumi Sena, was when he was five, was quickly dressed up as a young girl who catches the bouquet at a wedding.  He was so nervous, that he had a little accident and didn't want to proceed with the shoot until a slightly older boy, also acting in the shoot gave him a good luck charm.  The boy, Ryoma Ichijo, thought the girl he  fell in love with at the time was actually a girl.  Flash forward to when Izumi is in college and Ryoma is one of Japans up and coming actors.  When approached to do an anniversary commercial of the original wedding commercial, Ryoma agrees on the condition that the young girl who co-starred with him in the first commercial reprises her role.  Oops!  Izumi isn't happy and goes along with it because his rock star brother cons him with some rare anime trinkets.
So when Ryoma finds out that Izumi is a guy he's furious until he comes the self-realization that it's Izumi that he loves and that his true love's gender doesn't matter to him, though it most certainly matters to Izumi who wants nothing to do with Ryoma at first until he discovers Ryoma truly loves him by a series of actions that shows the depths of his love and what he does to make Izumi happy.
I do agree with Lynn that  Ryoma and Xan had stalking down to a very fine art form.  Ryoma is no Xan, however.  Xan was only trying to get into my pants.  Ryoma wanted and ultimately won Izumi's love with his unselfish acts.
Note:  For those who will argue that Xan was in love with me and only wanted me to return his love, I did run into a few years back in Downtown Disney.  He invited me up to his hotel room.  Can Lynn come to?"" I asked.  He took off running and I haven't seen him after that - thankfully.  And I did block him from seeing my FB and contacting me too after that last encounter.
Recommended for anime lovers - not recommended if yaoi is going to offend you.",1467244800,,5059,4.308668076109937
7672703,5,B01C6S1Z2K,"Sentai team, thank you so much for the Western release!  The Love Stage!! series quickly became one of my most beloved manga BL series, and now, I can say, anime too!  The BLU-RAY addition looks sooo flawless, and really shows off this cute and vivid collection.

I adored that the anime followed right along with the manga, yet truly enhanced my perception and interpretation of the characters and story.

The ohh-too-cute and aspiring, Izumi, matched with the ohh-soooo handsome and talented, Ryouma, are such a sweet yet humorous pair.  With each episode I was a constant mess of giggles, jovial-feelings, and a sense of inspiration due the reflection I was left with.  Izumi's older brother, Shougo, totally completed the experience!  Every scene featuring him had me laughing so hard!  I absolutely adored him and his outgoing-silly persona.  Rei was pretty cool too; always so stern and dutiful.  I loved seeing him and his expressions whenever he was caught off guard by something.

The whole Love Stage!! collective is definitely a must have for any affectionate and ecstatic BL lover.  Every chapter in the manga, and every episode in the anime only left me wanting for the next.  Thank you again!  Now I'll just need for the elusive Back Stage!!...my life would then be complete! <3",1466208000,4,1292,4.948837209302326

8752374,5,B01C6S1Z2K,"Cute anime
Wasn't expecting it to go like how it did but i enjoyed it:)",1517270400,,71,3.8
8752375,4,B01C6S1Z2K,"Love Stage!! is an anime based on the popular Yaoi manga of the same title. The anime is just a highly censored somewhat watered down version of the manga (damn censorship! :( ).

You don't have to be a fan of the manga to enjoy the anime as it's really entertaining, hilarious, and absurdly cute. However, if you don't like BL I'd advise against watching this. It may be censored (unfortunately) but they do try to toe the boundaries where they can, and if yaoi isn't your thing it will make you uncomfortable. But if you're willing to step out of your comfort zone then go for it! ;D

The plot, as always, is wonderful! I'm a huge fan of the manga and I loved seeing the animated form! Even if they took out Shougo x Rei (except for the one hint about their relationship in the last ep. :( ). And I didn't like the censorship ... it was weird the way the went about it! Though, the random appearances of the bear and cat (which represent the mangaka) were hilarious and really added to the humor! (for those curious the bear represented Zaou-sensei while the cat represented Eiki-sensei).

The soundtrack wasn't the best, but it was really catchy and fit the mood so ... no complaints. I did NOT however, like Shougo's VA! I cringed whenever he opened his mouth and that atrocity they call a voice emerged ... -_-"" But, the animation was wonderful ... with the one exception being the stupid censorship! (Why Japan? Why must you censor the H scenes? >.<). The characters though are wonderful, lovable, hilarious, and utterly adorable! The only thing I didn't like ... Lala Lulu and her entourage -_-"" ... but I was able to look past that ...

Overall, I had a lot of fun fangirling all over the place (squealing, jumping up and down, fist pumping ... yeah ... fangirling ... it's a real thing! xD). I recommend to the BL fans, fans of the manga, or just open minded people who are looking for something funny and cute to watch! I was quite satisfied to add this to my collection! ;D",1488758400,3,1984,4.4423076923076925

8752377,5,B01C6S1Z2K,"Poor Izumi Sena -- cursed with good looks that both men and women find irresistibly kawaii, all this young otaku wants to do is become a professional manga artist. Sadly, he has no artistic talent whatsoever. How Izumi becomes the erotic obsession of actor Ryouma Ichijo (TV's ""Detective Suzuki""), and their mutually maddening dance of attraction and repulsion is the subject of a romantic comedy that's smart, sexy, fast-paced, and very, very funny, especially when it pokes fun at the difference between BL manga and the awkwardness of real life sex.

There's some teasing, partial nudity and, in the final episodes, some fairly frank discussion (but no depiction) of backdoor sex. The series, like Izumi, is cute as hell and awfully hard to resist.",1481155200,2,751,5.056451612903226
