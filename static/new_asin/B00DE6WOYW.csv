8592479,5,B00DE6WOYW,"I have Jane Nelsen's Positive Discipline Book and just bought this DVD.

If you are a parent, this DVD should definitely be watched. It explains how in parenting we need to respect our kids and let them have control over some of their decisions and letting them experience good and bad.

The DVD helped me notice the problems in some of the other methods of ""discipline"" I had been using, and it helped changed my approach. Even if you don't have the book this is a nice DVD to have as a parenting tool.",1385510400,,503,4.340425531914893
