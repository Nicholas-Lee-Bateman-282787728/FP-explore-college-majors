8049185,5,B0007N19VE,"I highly recommend Shirley Barber's DVDs.  In a world full of violent cartoons, Shirley Barber's stories bring the innocence and magic back into children's TV. They have wonderful stories, graphics and music. Shirley Barber also offers books with CDs for children to read along.  I also recommend these to any little girl who loves fairies!",1185148800,5,340,5.163636363636364
8049186,4,B0007N19VE,"Let me first say that I really liked this video. It is a mixture of stories and songs done in a style that reminded me of old Reading Rainbow shows. The stories are illustrated animation with a few special effects. The songs feature 'Fairy Twinkle', who is played by an adult and her pixies which are played by some totally adorable kids. This is not a shiny flashy video, our family thinks of it as the video equivilent of playing with a well made wood toy. One very nice feature is that when you play the dvd, you can choose a 'day' and for each different day there is a pre-programed selection of songs and stories. Vol 2 has Thurs, Fri, and Sat, while Vol. 1 has Mon, Tues, Wed. It is a really neat way to keep the kids interested as they really get 3 different programs on each disk. You can also choose to play all or select a song or story.

If you are tired of some of the more modern animated dvd's available and want something visually interesting, but a little more down to earth I would highly reccomend this. This is most appropriate for 1-7 yr olds.",1126569600,19,1063,4.262376237623762
