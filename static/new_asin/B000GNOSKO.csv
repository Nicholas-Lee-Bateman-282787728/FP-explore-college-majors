8133550,5,B000GNOSKO,"In this DVD about Dame Janet Baker's last year on the operatic stage, she sings the title roles in Gluck's ""Alceste"" at Covent Garden, Donizetti's ""Mary Stuart"" with the English National Opera at the London Coliseum, and Gluck's ""Orfeo"" at Glyndebourne, the stage where she had appeared in her first opera.

Unfortunately, a complete recording of her 'Alceste' was never made, although excerpts appear on this DVD, but recordings of her last two operas are available:  ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donizetti-Mary-Stuart-Baker-Plowright-Rendell-Tomlinson-Opie-Bostock-Mackerras-English-National-Opera/dp/B0007TFI9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donizetti - Mary Stuart / Baker, Plowright, Rendell, Tomlinson, Opie, Bostock, Mackerras, English National Opera</a>"" from EMI; and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gluck-Orfeo-ed-Euridice-Baker-Speiser-Gale-Leppard-Glyndebourne-Opera/dp/B000294T3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gluck - Orfeo ed Euridice / Baker, Speiser, Gale, Leppard, Glyndebourne Opera</a>"" from Erato.

""Full Circle"" (both the book and the DVD) provide a detailed, behind-the-scenes look at what it took in terms of talent, suffering, and collegiality to produce these three operas.  I can't help wondering whether she agreed to make this video version of her last appearances on the operatic stage, not so much as a memorial, but as a method of forcing herself to retire.  Over and over on this video she talks about how relieved and happy she is that this part of her career is coming to an end.  Doth the lady protest too much?  In her written autobiography, she  spends quite a bit of text defending her reasons to quit opera while she was still at the height of her power:

""Some of the young [choristers] expressed mystification that I could give up opera when I can still do it!  It is a mystery to me too, not why I can give it up, but how I can find myself doing so with the sense of joy and completeness I undoubtedly have.""

Dame Janet was a trooper and managed to give thrilling performances in spite of serious physical ailments (never alluded to in this film).  As Harold Rosenthal (editor of ""Opera"") wrote in ""The Listener:""

""[Dame Janet] can hold an audience enthralled just as Maria Callas did.  I have been present on several occasions when this has happened...when one could not only hear the silence in the audience but experience that moment when performer, orchestra and listener were united by that magic spark that is kindled only when a great artist is on stage.""

Interspersed between scenes from her three last operatic performances are sequences from New York's Carnegie Hall, where Dame Janet sings the haunting Old English ballad, ""She Moves Thro' the Fair,"" and from Scotland's Haddo Hall, where she sings the Angel in Elgar's ""The Dream of Gerontius.""

Throughout this video, Dame Janet provides thoughtful commentary on what it means to be given the gift of such an extraordinary singing voice.  I thought it was fascinating to get a peek behind the scenes where she is working with her colleagues, accompanist, and French tutor.  There was only one 'Diva moment' when she grew exasperated with the cue lights on the cameras while the video of ""Mary Stuart"" was being made.  Even then, she took a vote among her fellow singers on stage, and presented their request to the producer, rather than throwing a Callas-type fit.

I hope all fans of this great English mezzo-soprano get a chance to watch ""Full Circle.""",1377043200,4,3536,5.525046382189239
8133551,5,B000GNOSKO,"I was fortunate enough to hear Dame Janet Baker in Madison, WI, while in college, back in the 70's. It was a stunning experience; such class and command of her art. This account of the last year of her operatic career has insights and fine artistry. Unfortunately, the sound recording is below par, especially in some of the spoken moments & interviews. Aside from the fine opera singing, my favorite moment was when she sang ""She Moves Thro' the Fair"" (an English folk song), at Carnegie Hall, as part of an American tour. Hearing Dame Janet reflect upon her remarkable career is most entertaining. Recorded by the BBC in 1982, and released by Kultur, this is a find for  any serious music lover, despite the often fuzzy sound (there ARE subtitles available).",1165363200,13,760,4.757575757575758
