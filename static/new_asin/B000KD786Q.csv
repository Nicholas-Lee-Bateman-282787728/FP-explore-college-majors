Go there to find Cinema anthologies for Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories (GBA version), and Kingdom Hearts 2, as well as other popular games.
As for a review, this set is very nice when you just want to sit down and enjoy the story of KH2, which in itself is epic and long. You also get a lot of movies you don't get to see on the American release of the game, such as the Final Mix version of the Special Ending movies. As for all the specs on the movies and what to expect, I just recommend going to the user's site. I hope this will help.",1324252800,2,617,4.107438016528926
