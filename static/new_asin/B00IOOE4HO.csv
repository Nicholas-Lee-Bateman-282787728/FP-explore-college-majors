6284251,5,B00IOOE4HO,"The movie American Made Movie is an excellent documentary on the decline of American manufacturing and it's correlation to the decline of the middle class and how we can get it back! This is such an inspiring movie. It costs $5 to rent it and play on your computer, smart tv or if you can link your flat screen to your laptop. This is a great movie for entrepreneurs, business owners, anyone who cares or just loves learning!",1404086400,,425,4.461538461538462
6284252,3,B00IOOE4HO,"American Made Movie depicts the stories of workers and companies caught in the plight of the disappearing manufacturing industry in America. It also profiles the hope and dedication of a few businesses who overcome all odds to stay American made.

The director of photography should definitely be commended for his work, especially the beautiful cinematography of Detroit and baseball.

In the last decade we have lost 5.5 million or one third of our manufacturing jobs and since 1979 the income gap has tripled in size. The tales and facts are interesting and educational but the movie is definitely in need of editing to make the storyline more cohesive and engaging. The movie came across mostly as a patriotic forum composed of a series of never ending interviews. Some of these interviews were boring and gave all too obvious insights. I felt like I was watching an infomercial instead of a well thought out documentary. Unfortunately this film could not keep my attention.  The slideshow of politicians endorsing U.S. manufacturing was amateurish and irrelevant.  The editors needed to add more narration and cut some time from the film.

If the movie outlined a more detailed plan to bring back American made,  and specified what ""Made in America"" means in a technical sense as well as its potential pitfalls, the film would have been worth watching.

I think it is noble that the movie takes up the fight for the American worker and encourages us all to buy American made.  The movies makes mention about places like Gwinnett County GA attracting foreign investors who invigorate our manufacturing base and entrepreneurs like Mark Andol who successfully specialize in selling US manufactured products.

The writers could have elaborated better on solutions including better government leadership who provide incentives to businesses and better marketing of US made goods. The movie should have mentioned some other businesses like American Apparel who have been successful in selling US made goods. The movie should have touched on the advantages and disadvantages of overseas manufacturing. Overseas manufacturing is cheaper and more efficient especially if raw materials are nearby but some overseas goods are made in sweatshops, for instance.

I give this movie three out of five stars. With the proper editing and trimming, this movie would be perfect for history and economics classes across the country and garner more stars (and stripes).",1401580800,,2453,5.21882951653944
6284253,4,B00IOOE4HO,"Documentary lovers, this is a must see!  All others, this is a great film to foray into the genre.  Unlike Michael Moore, who on the plus side has brought a lot of new viewers to the documentary format and opened the field to documentary filmmakers, there is no overriding voice of God telling you how, what and who to believe in.  The opening clipettes depict the relationship of filmmaker and subject through their form: an interview with the entire shot focused on the subject.  And thankfully, unlike Moore projects, this films star is the message, not the maker.

American Made Movie does a brilliant job of building a concrete relationship between a single product and the consumer; the connection between which has changed drastically over the last few decades due to outsourcing and globalization.  By showing the journey beginning with a living tree (and the loggers that mine them, their certifications and training), and ending with a Louisville Slugger (and those that market, retailers and all) as well as all the steps in between (truckers, mill workers, factory workers, and so forth), the viewer sees just how American a bat can be.  This trajectory also points out just how non-American most things in todays society actually are.  Did you know that New Balance was the only athletic shoe company to have an American factory?

Although the film offers five venues to improve our countrys overly-global trade and relatively non-existent manufacturing industry, thusly enlarging the middle class and lessening the divide between haves and have-nots, a fix feels too far away.  The cinematography of Detroit in ruins is stunning, the score adding just the right weight and unburdened by voice-over.  I could have watched an hour and a half of this alone, however, this portion filmed as beautifully as it was, weighs heavy on ones feelings of efficacy.  While my next pair of running shoes will certainly be New Balance, I am left asking: What can I do?  Seriously, please tell me because I have never felt such national pride as I do since watching American Made Movie.",1400284800,2,2084,4.971181556195965
6284254,5,B00IOOE4HO,"Disclaimer: this review is based upon watching an advance release copy of the documentary.

Many of economic problems these days revolve around the export of US manufacturing jobs. Ive known this since Ive been an adult and often wondered what it would take to reverse the trend. This very informative and apolitical documentary not only frames and defines the size of the problem, it proposes solutions. It shows in very understandable terms and human stories the role of US manufacturers play in our local and national economies and great challenges they face.

It presents the problem and shows solutions using the stories of a welding shop in Upstate New York, a home-based jewelry maker in Connecticut, and several other larger corporations. It also shows in easily understood terms and stories how the problem can be solved when business, local government, entrepreneurs and consumers can work together to keep manufacturing in the US.

It never resorts to name calling. It never hurls political invectives or bromides, it just lays out the causes:
1. Anti-competitive regulatory and tax environments.
2. Disparate labor costs - although it shows automation is an effective method for increasing worker productivity.
3. Involvement by government in business which allows them to lower their price below what the market would otherwise demand for those resources.
4. Short-sighted business and financial planning of publicly held corporations to meet investor expectations.

The one aspect it didn't directly mention was the effect of unions on labor costs. But it did show that manufacturing is doing well in open-shop states like Georgia.

It then identified the entities (business owners, investors, governments, entrepreneurs and consumers) who must play a role to solve the problem. Again, I wish more would have been done to show what unions can do to help, but it was still very informative and enlightening.

I want to show this to my family and friends. Local and national politicians, small and large business owners ought to watch it too. They should watch it because it shows working solutions to this problem. It was inspiring and gave me confidence the problem of jobs going overseas can be solved.

If you teach economics either as a public, private or home schooler, this documentary will be a great addition to your curriculum. If you want to understand the real challenges with manufacturing without the political invective and posturing, this documentary is a must see for you too. I highly recommend it!",1399593600,4,2528,5.181372549019608
8644176,1,B00IOOE4HO,"The jest of this documentary suggests that it is up to the American consumer to bring American made products back to America.  It does not discuss in any detail,  local and federal regulations that caused or allowed companies to leave the country.  The middle class supports our economy in many ways and cannot be held accountable for seeking a retail bargain.  Corporate American greed is responsible for the demise of manufacturing.  Our manafacturing process is based on milking the consumer.  If our country really wanted to stimulate consumer spending, my suggestion would be to get rid of the retailer and sell wholesale to the public.",1499472000,,641,5.057142857142857
8644177,5,B00IOOE4HO,"What a great documentary.  It's more about building something, rather than consuming.  Paying a little more for something of better quality that also supports and strengthens local communities that in turn strengthens larger communities and our Nation as a whole.  We need more of this.  I'm going to try to find more American Made products to try to buy as a way to invest in others, which is really ourselves as a community and a country.  Long term thinking by sacrificing a little in the short term.  Buying fewer but better made products and valueing them more because they cost more.  Less junk and clutter and a more organized life.",1490313600,,639,4.754545454545455
8644178,2,B00IOOE4HO,Meh...  kind of interesting.  I suppose it'd be very interesting if the goal is to be a 'consumer'.  I think folks in this documentary (all older white men except on or two) want the 1950's back.  This is about wanting back unsustainable consumerism of products made in the USA.  Kinda dislike....,1486944000,,297,4.745098039215686
8644179,5,B00IOOE4HO,"This is a an excellent take and perspective take on consumerism, trade deficits, U.S. manufacturing, etc. Some more depth (maybe in the form of a sequel - hint hint) could uncover caveats that would further the cause and purpose of this documentary.

8644181,3,B00IOOE4HO,"The idea behind this movie is wonderful. Small businesses are the backbone of America; they (not multinational corporations) are the true job creators. The film encourages consumers to make a concerted effort to buy products that are made in the USA, shop locally, and patronize small businesses.

The creators relied on many interviews with DC lobbyists and attorneys; some of who offered misleading information.  They also profiled 2 successful small business owners.

Some of the things that were not mentioned:
* For tens of millions of Americans working long hours for starvation wages, following the advice of this movie isn't an option. It is very difficult for them to pay even slightly higher prices or ""shop around"" for their necessities.
* The 2 small business owners profiled had means that allowed them to take risks. For example, the gentleman who was profiled had a supportive family, and parents willing to risk taking loans out on their home in order to finance their son's business ventures.  Fortunately, their gamble paid off. For millions of other entrepreneurs, their stories don't have a happy ending.  We all know at least one person who has lost their home after borrowing capital to start or grow a small business.
* In 2016, the majority of small businesses eventually fail (often through no fault of their own). The film should have also profiled some of these people, and touched upon the reasons WHY small businesses often collapse.
* The film did not touch on the road blocks in place (many put in place by our elected officials and the large corporations they represent) in the US, that cause small businesses to fail",1481500800,3,1649,4.9601449275362315

8644183,5,B00IOOE4HO,"This is a must see documentary for all Americans. After seeing this movie I'm going to see if I can find that 100% American made storefront online.
I sure hope he has developed an online store. Also, a personal note: I bought a pair of New Balance tennis shoes in the late 80's and they lasted me
over a decade!! I remember they weren't cheap, but I can't remember how many cheap shoes I've bought that quickly literally fell apart. I, for one,
would definitely buy American even if the product were several dollars more. God Bless America!!!!",1478390400,,543,4.551020408163265
8644184,5,B00IOOE4HO,"I am a small manufacturer in the USA. The business was started 10 years ago with the goal of designing and manufacturing all USA sourced products for a professional application. Most of our customers are interested in the idea of buying USA made solutions, but at the end of the day - they just want the lowest price. Even if it means they have to buy the same thing 4 times over buying our product once. The vast majority of our competition has gone off-shore for manufacturing and the prices have raced for the bottom while those competitors have risen to dominate our business sector. Now, the Chinese manufacturers are designing their own products and undercutting what is left of the USA based companies. Customers are flocking once again to the lowest price tag with no consideration for quality, longevity, function, support, much less American jobs and infrastructure. I cannot imagine a solution anymore that actually includes hiring people in the US. Everything I do now is based on the manufacturing being fully automated since manual tasks will ensure that our ability to compete plummets.

This film highlights all these things. It also points out that there are really few solutions if it will ever change. The people of the USA have to understand HOW prices are as low as they are. The true cost of cheap is our long term viability as a country. We have far fewer manufacturing skills and next to no infrastructure to build at a world scale. We as a nation willingly gave that up so we can have massive amounts of cheap disposable things for a few generations. The true price will be paid just like a high interest credit card. Painfully.

Good luck to my fellow USA based manufacturers. The government and the people are not going to help you.",1477353600,2,1759,4.726384364820847
