2655490,5,B000ICM5R6,"NEW INFORMATION: A recent reviewer asked about whether or not to return the discs from this DVD set to the Disney Company for the corrected discs.

I personally decided to return my original discs for the corrected ones for several reasons. ONE - the title cards (which list the title of the cartoons) had been recreated for this DVD release but ""someone"" in the production process didn't do their job and didn't attach these recreations to the cartoons. For me, this is a relatively minor reason to get replacement discs. TWO - The 1934 cartoon ""The Goddess Of Spring"" in this DVD release is a poorer quality copy. This cartoon was digitally restored and was included as an extra on the last Snow White DVD release. I have this cartoon in the nicer quality on that Snow White DVD so this is still a relativey minor reason to get the replacement discs. THREE - The 1933 cartoon ""The Night Before Christmas"" is included incomplete on this release. A short scene of black stereotyped toys in a parade are left out of the cartoon. I want the full uncensored cartoon so this is the MAJOR reason I returned my discs for the corrected discs. These newer discs are supposed to have all the above problems corrected.

Those reasons should give you, the customer, the information on whether you want to exchange your original discs for the replacement discs. As the other reviewer stated - you can call 1-800-723-4763 in the U.S. or 1-888-877-2843 in Canada. Tell the Disney customer service representative that you are interested in exchanging your More Silly Symphonies discs for the corrected discs.

By the way, I got the set when it was first released in December 2006 and I love the quality of the cartoons. Except for the relatively minor oops listed above, this is a fantastic quality collection - one I will treasure (along with all the other Walt Disney Treasures DVD sets) the rest of my life!!! There are hours and hours of fun cartoons and nice animation on this set!!

As happened in the first Treasures set of the Silly Symphony cartoons, some of the more controversial cartoons might be found only in an Easter Egg. ""Who Killed Cock Robin?"" is an example from the first set.

These last Silly Symphonies are among Disney's rarest, most interesting, and most entertaining cartoons. Some of them contain some fascinating experimental animation.

I very much look forward to watching these at DVD quality.",1163203200,96,3875,4.771641791044776
2655491,5,B000ICM5R6,"I'm very excited to hear that the rest of the Silly Symphonies will be coming out at the end of the year; however I am a bit concerned that not all the shorts will be included, in particular The Goddess of Spring, King Neptune, Old King Cole and the Piep Piper. Anyone know what the exact content of this Treasures set is?",1161043200,7,322,4.209677419354839
2655492,1,B000ICM5R6,"Very unhappy with this video.  It is in all black and white, could be digitally improved.  Flakes and particles move around on the parameter of the film.  I am returning this video.",1289779200,,181,4.59375
2655493,4,B000ICM5R6,"Enough people have labored here about how good these shorts are, so i won't add to that.  However, before you purchase, please be sure you get the CORRECTED discs from Disney.  Read on...

Back in the 1950's, Walk Disney had many of the earlier Silly Symphonies title cards replaced with cheesy ones featuring a big Mickey Mouse head. He did this because the early Disney shorts were distributed through other studios. Now that he owned all the distribution rights, he didn't want any other studio name to be seen on his films (Columbia, RKO, etc).  In case you didn't know, a title card is the first thing that pops up in the short.  It announces the title, the credits, production year, etc.  The 1950's replacements were pretty plain.  Many purists, myself included, prefer to see the original title cards, to put them in an historical context.  They also make the opening of the short different, as the correct ones set you up for what you are about to see.  It's kinda weird seeing a big Mickey Mouse head drawn in the 1950's, followed by a cartoon with 1928 animation.

Anyway, when this set was first released, Disney announced that it had corrected all the 1950's-era title cards, and given every short their original title card, as when each short was first released.  This didn't quite happen.  After many fans complained, Disney fixed the problem, restoring all the original title cards....but only through replacement discs.  They did not correct the ones already packaged.  So, if you DO want the corrected discs, you must contact Disney, and they will replace them for free.

In the end, it might not be something that many will care about, but i noticed it, and it's so much more fun to watch these as they are supposed to be viewed.  The 1950's changes aren't quite as bad as Greedo shooting first, but i like to see films as they were originally created.",1285200000,6,1871,4.693251533742331
2655494,5,B000ICM5R6,"Even though the set is now out of print, the replacement discs are still available as of Dec 2009. As promised, the correct title cards are in place. What's more interesting, Disney has dropped its PC pretensions re: The Night Before Christmas and restored the ""offensive"" Amos and Andy sequence (which only lasts about 10 seconds). There has also been some minor reordering of the selections.
If you own the original discs and haven't replaced them, it's definitely worth calling Disney Customer Service (the phone number is listed in some previous reviews) and get them (and the customer service rep even knew about the problem with the original discs- no lengthy explanation was necessary).",1262131200,2,693,5.087719298245614

The ""next time"" the Disney people put out the ""Sillies"" on video, they should publish them all, and in chronological order.

Re the title of my review. I so wish the Disney organization would do more to publicize these cartoon gems and to make more people aware of them. As it stands, if you know about these cartoons, you are one in 10,000 people! Also, this ""once in 10 years limited edition"" business is certainly not helping either. Video software is not likely to become a collectible in the long run, as new formats are invented.

2655501,5,B000ICM5R6,"A beautiful collection of early Disney short animated films, ""More Silly Symphonies"" has something for everyone.  The collection gives insights into the development of Disney animation leading to ""Snow White"" and other classic long-form productions; the themes and stories from an earlier era (many of which would likely not be used in our more ""progressive"" times); and why ""shorts,"" now a little-used form of animation, were so popular in that era.  But they are not for film buffs and vintage Disney fans alone.  Disney's impressive transfer of the original films to DVD has made them as fresh and current as the day they were made.  I was reminded of this recently as I witnessed the rapt attention my three granddaughters--ages 7, 5, and 2--gave to every one of them.",1169251200,4,772,4.961240310077519

Lots of commentaries, including several with specific focus on the music in the short. Very glad to see that they included some of the less politically correct shorts, though they have to use lots of disclaimers, both in the intros and in the commentaries, and they have 'buried' these in the specials on the discs (""From the Vaults""). No matter, it's just great that these are finally available!

2655511,4,B000ICM5R6,"I continue to be impressed and amazed by these Walt Disney Treasures.  For fans of early animation, they are indeed a treasure trove of rare material.  More casual Disney fans, including those who prefer modern computer-assisted animation, will likely not appreciate the cartoons here.

And while I'm certainly a fan of the early stuff, the fact is that many of the cartoons here don't measure up to the cartoons in Vol. 1 of the Silly Symphonies series.  The always-informative Leonard Maltin explains that this was still an experimental phase for the Disney animators, that they were honing their craft in preparation for their first feature-length animated film.  And that's fine, and it does import a certain historical significance to these short films.  But many of them are...well, for lack of a better word...pretty dull.  There's just so much cute, singing and dancing animal antics a person can take in one sitting.  Oh, there are exceptions, of course.  THREE ORPHAN KITTENS, OLD KING COLE, MOTHER GOOSE GOES HOLLYWOOD and BROKEN TOYS all offer something a little different.  And no matter how big a Disney fan you might be, nothing can compare you for the bizarre 1929 short HELL'S BELLS: Imagine, if you will, the name which would become synonymous with Family Entertainment for generations actually made a 7-minute musical cartoon set entirely in hell!

For the completist, this is certainly a must-buy.  And most classic animation fans will find enough of value here to make this set worth owning.  But as a huge fan myself, and one who owns most of the other Walt Disney Treasures, I don't feel like this is one I will re-watch very often.",1167696000,10,1655,4.931407942238267
2655512,1,B000ICM5R6,"I was very much looking forward to this release but a number of things have irritated me about it.

First of all on disc 2 there are a number of issues. During the short 'More Kittens' at 2:06 black and white blocks appear on the screen. Since a number of various online forums and sites have mentioned this, it obviously means it is not just my copy that is affected. Also the cartoon 'The Moth and the Flame' changes aspect ratio in the middle of a shot!

Further to this the short 'The Night Before Christmas' had been edited, a small scene featuring black dolls has been removed.

Also the issue of restoration has annoyed me. If you watch the featurette in the bonus features, you see clips of shorts like 'The Goddess of Spring' which have restored picture. Yet for some stupid reason even though a restored print obviously exists when you actually watch the short of 'The Goddess of Spring' it is not the restored version and is an older version. The print is not terrible, but why provide a dull grainy version when a restored one is available?

Another annoyance is that during his introduction Leonard Maltin says that since the original title cards have been lost, new ones have been created especially for this release that recreate the way they originally looked. But obviously due to some goof, these newly created title cards are completely absent.

Also the shorts on disc one have had seemingly nothing done to them. Now I know that black and white shorts from the 1920s are never going to look like they were made yesterday, but I'm sure Disney could have done better than this! When independent studios manage to produce DVDs overflowing with excellent restoration and bonus features for relatively unknown titles. I'm sure a corporate giant like Disney could do much better than this but it looks like they'd rather be miserly penny pinchers and get this stuff on the market as cheaply as they can. If only Disney cared about their past as much as we do!",1167523200,34,1974,4.644699140401146
2655513,5,B000ICM5R6,"All early animation is a vital part of anyone's cinema collection...that is, if you're either an animation fan or a film historian. This package, as great as it is, is DEFINITELY not for everyone, as some people may find the early toons too tedious. I find that even the most hardcore fan has trouble sitting thru the early toons in chronological order, as you can only put up with dancing animals, dancing plants and other non-human dancing things for only so long (I suggest everyone watch these in alphabetical order, NOT chronological).

That aside, the gems are definitely the color toons; it's about time we saw ""Little Hiawatha"" again! It's great! And as lame as ""Goddess Of Spring"" is (it's pretty awful!) it's important as it paved the way for Walt's ""Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs."" The color on my collection was excellent and Jerry Beck & Leonard Maltin (among others) provide some informative commentaries.

You'll see the original ending of ""Cannibal Capers"" and scratch your head wondering why it was cut off when it aired on ""The Mickey Mouse Club""...the censored scene is only a few seconds long and contains nothing racial, sexist or offensive...I DON'T GET IT!

Casual toon fans and those who didn't grow up with Black & White TV may not enjoy this set, but the rest of us know how important it is to own these historical films.",1167350400,9,1347,4.747863247863248

2655515,4,B000ICM5R6,"THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DISNEY DVD RELEASE THIS YEAR! Many of these cartoons are appearing on home video for the first time ever in any format & language!

First let me say that this is a FIVE STAR ***** collection of cartoons that have been talked about by other reviewers here, so let me talk about the DVD presentation & film transfers.

DISC 1 only:
Again Disney has decided to save money and not digitally restore the nitrate deterioration on the original negatives.  The picture flicker & blotches can be tolerated as these are around 86 years old or more.

Strangely, some cartoons have hairs & dirt on the sides of the picture frame & sometimes stuck in the center of the picture through out the entire cartoon.  These could have been digitally removed.

Most of the B&W cartoons are window-boxed with different aspect ratios, some are taller than they are wider.  I am confused by this, I have only run across this on silent films that have had soundtracks added on re-releases.

Most of the B&W cartoons have the re-issue title cards with Mickey Mouse's face introducing the cartoon.  Leonard Maltin explains how the original title cards were lost on most of these when they were re-released, but then he talks about restoring the original look of the title cards.  Maybe nobody told him they weren't going to do it.

One other strange problem is with the menu.  The ""Play All"" feature plays the shorts in a different order that the ""Chronological Order"" and the ""Alphabetical Order"".  The ""Play All"" plays the shorts in the order listed in the insert, which gives different release years for some shorts than on the ""Chrolonogical Order"" listing.
Both play out sequences differ from the published chronological orders in Disney books by Leonard Maltin & Dave Smith.  The published chronological orders seem to be the correct ones.

DISC 2 ONLY:
Most of the color cartoons have gotten the digital picture & audio restoration treatment. THEY LOOK & SOUND GREAT! The exceptions to this are in the ""From The Vault"" secition.  I guess these cartoons with racial stereotypes have little use for Disney so they were not cleaned up as much.  The colors are still vibrant, but there is nitrate deterioration on the sides.

Disc 2 also ""Plays All"" in the chronological order, unlike Disc 1.

Well, those are all trivial complaints.  The bottom line is that Disney is offering these RARELY SEEN cartoons mastered from their best existing negative material.  THIS IS A REAL TREAT.",1166745600,32,2482,4.82033096926714
2655516,4,B000ICM5R6,"Given I'm a fan of the first set of Silly Symphony releases, I was intrigued by this second set. Of the two discs that comprise this follow-up edition, the animations done in color, all found on the second disc in the set, are exceptionally rich, inventive (as expected) and fun to watch. They easily merit repeated viewings. The black and white symphonies that appear on the first disc count among some of the earliest cartoons in Disney's animation output and demonstrate Disney's attempt to master the rudimentary visual aspects of the animation craft. No doubt these early pieces will hold vast appeal for animation buffs, film historians and academics, however, for the average viewer, their charms wear thin quickly as they are less dynamic visually and less engaging as narratives. What's important to keep in mind, of course, is how quickly Disney progressed, attaining sophistication both as animator and storyteller while moving from crude, herky-jerky black and white to balletic, technicolor virtuosity. This is what the both Silly Symphony sets chart magnificently. Taken together, these sets count as some of the most important in the Treasures Series and are certainly on the highest rung regarding significant animation releases on DVD.",1166572800,7,1252,5.265

8145139,5,B000ICM5R6,"The Silly Symphonies were among the best cartoons of the 1930's. Technological advancements, storytelling, and character development were honed in this series over a ten year period.
The first volume of Silly Symphonies in the Disney Treasures series brought most of the significant and well known entries in the series, such as Three Little Pigs. Volume Two completed the collection by delivering many shorts that had never been released on any video format. Most of these are the earliest Silly Symphonies, from the first three years. One might dismiss the shorts of 1929-31 as primitive, but the animation quality and effects are actually quite impressive for that time. If animators at rival studios studied the Disney Oswald shorts in 1927-28, surely they marveled at the increasing quality Disney's cartoons just a couple years later.

Disc One features all black and white shorts from 1929-32. These shorts are driven by classical music and mostly feature animals or bugs. The narratives are thin, but the shorts are charming mood pieces. The best ones are the four seasons Springtime (1929), Summer, Autumn, and Winter (all 1930), Frolicking Fish (1930), and Night (1930).

Disc Two covers 1932-38 and makes the jump to color. Some of the best ones are Old King Cole (1933), The Pied Piper (1933), The Goddess Of Spring (1934), and Cock O' The Walk (1935). All the Christmas themed Silly Symphonies are featured here: Santa's Workshop (1932), The Night Before Christmas (1933), and Broken Toys (1935).

This is one of the only Treasures to feature audio commentaries. The Disney experts provide insightful background on select shorts.

The Disney Treasures was good for releasing the entire (99 percent) filmography of the Disney sound cartoon shorts uncensored. Typically cartoons with politically incorrect content (or content that Disney finds objectionable for whatever reason) has a contextual intro or is placed in a section called 'From The Vault' with a disclaimer. This volume has the most cartoons with that designation. Most of them have a short scene with an Un-PC gag. This was probably one of the factors as to why some of these shorts were unavailable for many years intact or at all. The set boasts that fact, with an emphasis on Mother Goose Goes Hollywood (1938), the most unusual but among the best shorts on this volume.
These are rare films that are truly worth seeing and owning. No Disney enthusiast should skip this Treasure.",1503532800,,2457,5.104477611940299

The episodes on this set have had some restoration done and for the most part look fine considering their age.

The first disc contains 21 shorts including some very rare and politically incorrect cartoons. The shorts are presented here unedited with one containing two endings to show how it was changed to appease cry babies!
