4042936,5,B00305GK4W,"I have this and A Christmas Snowfall ( which I got first). I like this one best. The photography is beautiful and so are the songs. But then it IS the O'Neill Brothers. I think of the two DVDs, this one was done first, but as I said, this is my favorite although  it doesn't have as much falling snow. I suspect they were criticized for that fact which was why they made another one that had falling snow in every scene. I got that one first and am glad I did because , apparently, I needed to watch it fall. This one also has scenes of snowfall, but not nearly as much And the synchronization of the photography and the music is wonderful. I recommend them both. I'm getting more copies of this one to give as Christmas presents. If you love snow and Christmas, buy this and you can't go wrong. Enjoy.",1379721600,3,802,4.207792207792208

4042938,4,B00305GK4W,I just wish it was higher def. Other than that - perfect. I liked the music selection for background seasonal music.,1356652800,,116,4.571428571428571
4042939,5,B00305GK4W,Just what I needed to bring some winters feel to a Florida Christmas! Love having it on in the background.,1355616000,,106,4.35
4042940,3,B00305GK4W,Very nice snow scenery and appropriate for back drop for parties or stage performance.  Some scenes are obvious fake snow fall with clouds of mist that are frozen in space.  For the price and my use of a back drop it was acceptable.,1353110400,,232,4.372093023255814
4042941,5,B00305GK4W,"Just what the title states.  If you are looking for beautiful scenics and music to soothe your soul this holiday season, I highly recommend this DVD.  Shot in widescreen, it looked very nice on my new HDTV.  I've made mistakes in the past by buying a few of the other cheaper DVDs here online, but as usual, you get what you pay for.",1285718400,2,333,4.253968253968254
8385477,5,B00305GK4W,"Five WINTRY Stars. ""Snow for the Holidays"" (Snow for Christmas) is an excellent mostly 'live' screen saver of scenes of snow, lots of snow in and around man-made locations and natural locations. The video keeps changing the many scenes every few minutes as they move from snowy neighborhoods, to forests, to icy rivers, to mountain cabins, to snowy mountain vistas. Some scenes are re-used, but not to excess. As each separate video scene changes, it is accompanied by a different, joyful, familiar Christmas/Holiday song performed by the O'Neill Brothers which consists of them playing solo piano, solo guitar, and synth. And it all ends on a fitting closing scene that may bring a smile. Not much snow falling, but tons of fallen snow in the vistas. Highly Recommended. Five PICTURESQUE Stars. (Grono Productions. Color.
