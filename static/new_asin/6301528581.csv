340956,5,6301528581,"The 50s was a great decade for Westerns and this is one of the better ones. Gregory Peck, a gifted actor who generally does well, regardless of the genre, just seems to be made for this role. In fact Peck decided to become a rancher while he was making this film and purchased a vast working ranch in California. This is a good story, with excellent acting...even by Joan Collins, who in 1958 was quite a looker. I was surprised by the ending, although I'd figured out the outlaws Peck was chasing were not the culprits in the death of his wife. If you like to watch a good Western, you will not be disappointed in this offering",1495065600,,628,4.330508474576271

340958,5,6301528581,"No doubt about it, The Bravados was and still is a Western drama of excitement and suspense. Directed by Henry King in 1958, he leads a
determined Gregory Peck who plays the role of Jim Douglas, to find the killers who raped and murdered his wife, leaving behind a young child.
The chase progresses through two Countries, America and Mexico. The storyline begins in the County of Rio Arriba New Mexico, which
borders the Rio Grande that divides it from Mexico.
Much of the film was photographed in Mexico's Michoacan and Jalisco provinces, to capture the magnificent canyons, mountains, forests
and waterfalls. Indeed a sight to see!
In addition to the Newman soundtrack of music that fit the mood of the intense plot, a good cast of well-known actors were present. English and
Spanish spoken in the film, which ended with a surprise conclusion.
The National Board of Review Award was given to Albert Salmi for Best Supporting Actor.",1474934400,,933,4.8742138364779874

341049,1,6301528581,"Watching this late fifties Hollywood western was a genuine exercise in nostalgia, and appreciation for Gregory Peck, the actor. There were not many other reasons for sitting through to the end of the movie. It is a perfect illustration of how bad, how wooden, how trite, how stereotyped, and how seriously boring this genre could be in the hands of the right, or in this case wrong, director. There were times when I thought Joan Collins would choke on the awful trite lines she had to deliver. It is also a shame the director never figure out you could actually shoot scenes of two actors speaking to each other without standing them up like cigar store Indiana, woodenly facing each other, while the camera shoots them from a precise 90 degree perpendicular angle from their sides. The actors were for the most part more like stuffed automatons, reciting bad lines from a bad script. Oh, well. I guess even great actors had to make movies to eat, occasionally.",1467849600,,962,4.732142857142857

341360,5,6301528581,"Gregory Peck gives another great performance in a western tale of vengeance that rises above the cliche. He plays rancher Jim Douglas who has been trailing four men for the rape and murder of his wife. As the movie starts he arrives in a small town where the four outlaws are waiting to be hung for robbery and murder. When they escape Douglas ends up leading the posse. What follows is a movie that showcases his skills as a tracker against desperate men he intends to kill. Stephen Boyd gives a chilling performance as the sadistic sociopath who leads the outlaws.

The slowly-unfolding twist during the last half-hour is paced brilliantly; loose ends are tied together in a spiritually heart-felt bow. It really sends home that 'to err is human, to forgive is divine'. Our hero ends up surrendering to the big karmic picture, being easy on himself, and moving on. The Madonna and Child imagery is done really well. It was a great era in Hollywood and I'm very happy that classics such as this are available on Amazon Prime.",1452297600,,612,4.513513513513513

Peck runs into an old girlfriend, Joan Collins, who we learn he had proposed to at one time and she said no.  Peck joins the towns men in perusing the four criminals.  Stephen Boyd, Albert Salami, Lee Van Cleef and Henry Silva are the four men being pursued by Peck.  In one scene when Jim Douglass, Peck, confronts Lee Van Cleef and shows him a picture of a his wife in an old watch.  Van Cleef did the same thing in the Movie ""For a Few Dollars More when he confronts the man who killed his sister.  With a name like Josefa Velarde, Joan Collins plays a Mexican beauty, with no accent, but with her looks and good looks I don't think any one cared. The story is well told and acted.

341502,3,6301528581,"This movie had its moments, but was overpriced considering that this was definitely NOT the best performance of Gregory Peck.  Contrasting his other films like 12:00 High, this film falls far short of the mark.  Your reviewer remembered seeing this film as a child circa 1958 about half way into it.  For its time, it was a hot production, even was released in NYC.  The climax was reached very late when a tired Peck finally gets the point that revenge is blind and that revenge is not justice.  Contrasting this film with another one like Nevada Smith may help to understand the negative plot a bit better, if this were a course in film that is.  Peck doesn't really sell his total conversion to absolute crudeness very well.  That's a tough job for any actor to pull off.  Steve McQueen probably did a better job in Smith.  That role led to Papillon in which the theme of total conversion to absolute crudeness was much better developed.",1446595200,,940,4.614457831325301

341575,4,6301528581,"To me, the height of Hollywood occurred in the 1950s, that decade was its golden era.  Twentieth Century Fox was at it greatest, in my opinion. For the Twentieth Fox gold-colored logo and its accompanying fanfare to burst onto the screen means one thing: Hollywood movie entertainment. At this time Cinemascope, still a relatively new technology, was in vogue. In this decade, audiences attended movies shown in palatial theaters. Famous of this decade are a host of iconic actors, men, and women, who graced the movie screen, bringing to life characters of the stories in which they play.

Despite a three-year war in Korea, though the U.S. cold war with the Soviet Union was heating up to the point of near mass public paranoia, and never forget the McCarthy hearings, this decade was Americas utopian dream come true, the decade of prosperity following a devastating war. It was good times for most people, especially if one was white, straight, and male. So it was the best of times for many people as it was the worst of times for other people. Amid all this, during this decade, great movies were made. One of those movies is this one, The Bravados, starring Gregory Peck and Joan Collins.

The story starts out simple enough: A stranger, wearing dark clothes, rides his horse into a sleepy little, prairie town, one preparing itself for a hanging. So small this town, so unfamiliar the stranger,  that his presence receives immediate attention. A once sleepy town now comes awake. It is the day before the hanging. We learn our hero, the stranger in town, that he is here in order to witness tomorrows hanging of four bad-guys. His manner is aloof, a man of few words, not icy but cool towards anyone friendly enough to extend a hand of friendship. Peck plays our hero, the protagonist, who will turn out to be somewhat an anti-hero. His character demonstrates dimensions of complexity as the story unfolds.

Through prearranged plotting with an outsider, the criminals, the jailed criminals, are able to escape from the local jail. With stolen horses, guns, and with a local girl, kidnapped, they ride into the open country confident they will successfully escape.

Well, that begins our heros journey. He with men of the town, in posse, ride off after the jail-breakers. Our hero has a vendetta to fulfill as we will learn with the storys development. Upon its conclusion arises an unexpected irony making the story unexpectedly interesting.

As a whole, this western story is very good. The scenes were shot in wonderful country settings, thinking maybe Yellowstone? The acting of actors in supporting roles is something left wanting. At times, the screenplay exposes it own story holes in the very story it is meant to convey. But Pecks acting is very good, maybe remarkable. Joan Collins seen in her youth is a tremendous beauty. Her character is weak, partly not a fault of her won due to the scrawny screenplay writing with which she had to work, with which to flesh out a character, succeeding at portraying a very two-dimensional character.

Without a doubt, this movie is entertaining. Its story interesting. The acting of the leading man is done admirably well. Movie cinematography is typical of that era, panoramic, vibrant with vivid colors, straight on filming, nothing fancy. The Bravados is an unexpectedly good western, recommended highly.",1445126400,,3364,4.941592920353982

That said, what really makes the film stand out for me is the amazing cinematography by multiple Oscar winner, Leon Shamroy (Cleopatra, Leave Her To Heaven). In fact, I'll say it's one of the most beautifully shot westerns that I've seen and one worth seeing for that aspect alone.",1442880000,,575,4.538461538461538

He was once a decent man now a harden man .He goes to take a look at the 4 men in the jail who are about to  hung at daylight  , The bad guys  played by . Stephen Boyd , Albert Salmi . Henry Silva and Lee Van Cleef . This is a very good film , the Western  is shot production as its filmed  mostly  outside. Not to give too much away the convicts escape with a hostage . Boyd is convincing as a sex sadist and leader of the group  , Lee van Clef , who is very familiar with Westerns plays His second in command , Silva plays the Indian/ Mexican. This film is  quite good l for a film from the late 50's, not like many Westerns that were very popular then , as the genre was getting old ,  Peck plays a tracker but a man who lost His family and know these 4 men rode by His home that dreadful night when His wife was raped and both His kid an wife was then murdered .Peck is convincing as this man bent on blind revenge  . Peck been in many Westerns, next to ""Yellow Sky "" , this role is different for Him because  He plays not the Hero or the roles He usually plays and in this film ,  I recommend this film even if you already seen it .It holds up well after 50 something years. Its has a great cast , Henry Silva who been in may Westerns such as Tall T and many more Lee Van Cleef would appear in many TV Westerns and Movies be in two of the "" Man with No Name "" trilogy and Stephen Boyd will always be remember for His role in Ben Hur and Joan Collins who a British actress would be in many films and then in the 80's be in the TV show Dynasty and Salmi would be in TV shows mostly .

341715,5,6301528581,"In my mind a number of Classic Westerns keep circulating. There is the John Ford ( Cavalry) Trilogy, the First 3 Clint Eastwood Westerns and there is Apache Territory with Rory Calhoun. Oh yes, add and put The Bravados at the top of that heap. Others here can give you the summary better then I but here goes anyway: Jim Douglass ( Gregory Peck) has traveled a long way ( over 100 Miles) to a small town to witness the hanging of 4 men he believes killed his wife and burned down his ranch. He is a stranger here ( or is he?) as he quickly is observed by a priest whom he knows ( Andrew Duggan) and a former girlfriend ( Joan Collins) who lets Jim know she is still single and us that in another time frame he asked her to marry him. More on these 2 later. The expected hangings don't happen, the bad guys get away and the rest of the film is about Jim and his hunt down of the fugitives. The posse is there as well ( and mostly lag a long way behind our hero and the wanted men ). The ongoing change in disposition of all the characters in this movie , a real metamorphasis is what makes this movie great. There is a fine cast of character actors as well, Henry Silva, Lee Van Cleef and Gene Evans and Albert Salmi to name a few and all are excellent . As has been stated by others this is a thinking mans' western. Not in the sense that it is incredibly complicated. More that everything is first rate, believable and works so well, from the dialogue to the scenery, the plot twists, great camera shots, acting etc etc. Back to Joan Collins and Andrew Duggan . Nobody ever looked hotter then Josefa Velarde ( Joan) in gloves and a western hat or is more reassuring and calming then their priest ( Andrew) as we see here. I think you will find on your western movie checklist of likes all the appropriate boxes have been checked off. No bathroom breaks on this movie as it rightly commands your full attention from start to finish. 5 stars no doubt, great opening music, lots of action, love hate, surprise and a great ending, it doesn't get any better then this!",1428278400,,2064,4.227848101265823

341780,3,6301528581,"1) The DVD - If you know the movie, want it, and are simply wondering about the quality of the DVD, here are some things to consider. Side ""A"" is the pan and scan version.  Side ""B"" is the widescreen version.  Know what you're getting. I'm no aficionado, but the color seemed bright and the contrasts good.  All and all, I was quite content with the picture quality.

2) The movie - If you saw it, as I did, years ago and liked it, and you are wondering: ""Does it holds up?"" - a few notes.  I did not find it as compelling as I did when I first viewed it.  Some plot holes were more evident, including at least one whopper.  Peck is one of my favorite actors, so I enjoyed watching him.  But that doesn't blind me to him being just a bit ""off"" here.  This may be direction more than Peck.  The picture calls out for more from Peck.  I'm wondering if a director like Anthony Mann might not have gotten a performance from him that is more in keeping with his character.

If you've never seen the movie, and are wondering: ""The Bravados"" is a good movie, not a great one.  Peck does a good job, not a great one.  If you're simply looking for a Peck western, I'd look to ""The Big Country"" or ""The Gunfighter.""  Both are excellent movies with Peck nailing the character.  ""The Bravados"" is, at its core, about revenge and its cost to the person seeking revenge.  It doesn't misfire.  It's a good movie.  But it could have been so much better.  I would strongly recommend ""streaming"" or renting it rather than buying. If I could, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.

He takes on a completely different role than usual and plays Jim Douglas, a vindictive, vengeful gunman out to kill the men he's convinced raped and murdered his wife.  Turns out he's got things a little wrong and the ending throws you a curve.  In the interim he recoonects with a woman from his past for whom he seemed to have no real affection but realizes she's got quite a bit to offer (she, on the other hand, has been in love with him from the get-go.)  This is a really good western that gets more than adequate support from Lee Van Cleef, Henry Silva and Albert Salmi (all veterans of 50's westerns) as well as Stephen Boyd and Joan Collins.

341784,4,6301528581,"I was on a Gregory Peck kick after watching ""Stalking Moon"" - and therefore, still locked in the mood for another good Western, decided to go for this one, since I hadn't seen it before, either.

It does have a lot going for it, and I enjoyed it - beautiful Southwest photography, which always enchants me, held together by a good story line.  It is about a man who has lost his wife to what he believes was a pack of mongrels that passed through his ranch while he was gone, ravaging and killing his wife, somehow sparing his child, who is being taken care of now by a good hearted Mexican woman while he is on his manhunt; stealing his money and some horses to boot.  Strong and silent as only Gregory Peck could be, he sets out for revenge and tracks his four suspected desperadoes to a little desert town - and as he rides in, he learns that his targets are being held there for other crimes; have already been tried and convicted, and the town is preparing to hang them the next morning.  We can tell from the determined glitter deep in Peck's eye that he has no interest in the ""bring 'em back alive"" philosophy, but watching them hang would be the next best thing to wasting them himself.  And so, brooding and dangerous, he rides on into the little Border town to grimly witness the hanging - and the story begins.

The plot woven around this story is interesting and tied together for the most part -  but not very tight in several other areas.  The roads, which are obviously graded county roads, are resplendent with automobile tire tracks in one sequence by the creek.  The dogged tracking of two of the varmints into a saloon at the end, where one darts out the back door, leaps on his horse and pounds across the prairie straight to his hacienda where his own wife and baby wait, leading Peck right to him. And then, there was the corny ending.  Otherwise, it was a very good movie with a lot of somewhat believable action - and I recommend it to those wanting to see an old Western - the kind that still holds immeasurable charm for us die-hard nostalgics.",1325116800,,2071,4.383812010443864

Interesting enough twist at the end though not fully milked to its potential. Peck plays a more brutal, heroic role than usual. Based on a novel by Frank O'Rourke.

He rides for months to find and kill them. He hears that the four will be hanged in a certain town, and rides there to see them hung. The four escape the jail and kidnap a girl.

 A posse realizes that he has skills and allows him to lead them. He shows his skill by having one of the posse fire a shot at night from time to time to confuse the four outlaws and put them on edge. During the chase the head outlaw rapes the kidnapped girl, kills Peck's neighbor, and takes a bundle of gold from him. Peck separates from the posse and finds the outlaws one by one, and kills all but one. Each swears that neither he nor the other three had anything to do with his wife's murder, but this does not stop him from killing them.

341789,3,6301528581,"Henry King may be among the most symbolically quintessential American of American filmmakers. Compared to the likes of the stylized extrovert John Ford, King is a straightforward director and, thus, remains one of the underrated American symphonists (putting him in good company with forever underrated fellow American symphonists, such as David Diamond and Paul Creston). ""Twelve O' Clock High"", ""The Gunfighter"" and ""The Bravados"" are integral canvases of the American frontier landscape that King made with  Gregory Peck, yet the latter two languish in near obscurity.

King collaborated often with Peck, and in Peck King had his best collaborator. Gregory Peck was the real deal. With Peck, one does  not have to separate the artist or the persona from the actual person (as one has to with John Wayne). Gregory Peck fit the iconic bill of integrity and nobility on and off-screen and, thus, personifies the best and most honestly masculine qualities in the western, which, along with jazz, is one of the two great American art forms.

Together, King and Peck vividly imprinted these qualities into each film's characterization without flinching from the flaws, warts and frailties which flesh out and give resonance to that characterization. King and Peck had created their previous western ""The Gunfighter"" eight years earlier. That is a film which deserves all the accolades it has received. ""The Bravados"" has even less a reputation. It is a very different film than ""The Gunfighter"", yet it deserve a wider audience. While ""The Gunfighter"" was shot in stark black and white, ""The Bravados"" benefits greatly from Leon Shamroy's sense of composition and ethereal blue filters. On the surface, ""The Bravados"", at first, seems to be another standard revenge film, but it is the juxtaposition of faith and violence that gives this film its tensioned individuality. Here again, we have the authenticity of Peck, the off-screen man of a deep Catholic faith, that informs his role, imbuing it with a striking inner intensity. Peck conveys emotions with expertly gauged skill, acting with his eyes and internal hesitancy. He stops short of speaking several times. Peck makes this a remarkable role.

Then, in direct contrast, is Joan Collins. As the old flame, Collins was still fairly early in her career, and it shows. Despite her reputation, Collins did sharpen her acting skills considerably, but that is not in evidence here. In several scenes, such as her initial reunion with Peck, discovering his past via a local priest, and her pleading with him to take revenge, Collins registers stiffness. Her part is underwritten and awkward, rendering it as, mostly, one of decor, which she does succeed in filling out. Still, Peck's attraction to her never registers.

Future Stooge Joe DeRita is quite good in his eccentric characterization. His is a small role, but he fleshes it out with personality, making one wish he had gone this route instead. Of the four antagonists, only Stephen Boyd and Henry Silva have any real personality. Boyd vividly registers as a real, slimy threat. Silva employs admirably restrained depth when face to face with his hunter.

The shifting, contrasting landscapes make for interesting, expressionist parallels. The rugged, rocky canyon terrain gives way to an ominous forest in which Peck both murders and escapes murder. A waterfall gives temporary sustenance. A small, claustrophobic cabin houses the ugly, terrible truth. The unrealistically large Catholic parish contains the vast possibilities of sanctuary and redemption, but that is only reached after revelation at the home of the good thief, where Peck is met with surprising hospitality and familiarity of family.

""The Bravados"" is a harsh, brooding, tautly paced example of the 1950s western at its most adult. Despite some minor flaws, it is a stand-out in its genre, during the genre's greatest decade.",1282435200,,3901,5.2304

A man seeks revenge and so he decides to track down the four responsible of having murdered and raped his wife; just to become- during the untamed journey- one of them.

341793,4,6301528581,"This film deals pretty openly with subjects that were still sort of taboo in 1958 -- rape and revenge killings.
Briefly, the plot revolves around Peck's Jim Douglass role. He's a rancher who has been dogedly hunting down four very bad men who could've raped and killed his wife. He finds them in jail 100 miles away from his ranch ... Not to give too much away, but the movie turns into a 90 minute chase and morality play. Great acting from Peck, Stephen Boyd, Henry Silva, Lee Van Cleef and Albert Salmi (who was the ""bad guy"" in more 60s and 70s tv shows than are probably listed online).
What strikes me most of all, is that from looking at this film, you can see it clearly had an influence on Sergio Leone almost a decade later when he made his Western triology starring Clint Eastwood.
There's the lone gunman against the world theme, along with revenge killing (not really done all that much in westerns before) and almost directly taken from The Bravados is the watch-with-a-picture. Peck holds out a watch with a picture of his dead wife to, Lee Van Cleef (and the rest of the bad guys) as a sort of guilt weapon. In 1965's ""For a Few Dollars More"" Van Cleef plays very much the same type of role as Colonel Mortimer having chased a man who performed almost the same act on his family.
This film gets an A for production and script. It's a little hokey at the end with Peck talking to a priest, but at least the acting and scenery are interesting.
It's a good film. Well worth a Saturday afternoon viewing.",1194912000,,1516,4.398576512455516

341799,3,6301528581,"There's going to be a hanging in Rio Arriba, and Jim Douglass (Gregory Peck) has ridden a hundred miles to see it.  You see, the four men - Stephen Boyd, Albert Salmi, Henry Silva and Lee van Cleef - about to be hanged committed a great crime that changed Douglass's life forever, and he's there to see justice carried out.  When the condemned men escape, Douglass makes it his personal mission to deliver justice to the bad guys.
  I love revenge movies, and the premise of Henry King's THE BRAVADOS holds great promise.  One avenging angel - Gregory Peck - versus four scurvy killers.  The best revenge movies go to the chase as soon as possible, and reveal character and motivation through the chase.  Unfortunately THE BRAVADOS takes forever to kick into gear.  The movie spends a good half hour in Rio Arriba, an eternity in movie time, introducing characters and establishing motives.  Some of the characters don't really belong in the movie, either.  It's in Rio Arriba that we meet Josefa Velarde (Joan Collins), a beautiful young Elizabeth Taylor type who met, loved and declined Douglass's proposals a half-decade or so ago.  Collins wasn't a terrific actress, and some of her high emotion scenes in this one are painfully amateurish.  Even a talented actress wouldn't redeem the role, though.  Every time Josefa appears the movie grinds to a halt.  THE BRAVADOS prove the rule that women and action movies don't mix.
  On the trailer Gregory Peck tells us that THE BRAVADOS is `a big story with a big impact.'  I'd call it a potentially big story that never gets on track.  We learn a big surprise or two near the end, ones that should have taken our breath away.  Instead they kind of limp over the line, somewhat naked in their improbability.  Peck proves capable of doing justice to a revenge-ridden protagonist. It would have been fascinating, and probably would have resulted in a much better movie, if he could have spent more time exploring the dark side of his character.
  The double sided dvd contains both full screen and widescreen versions of the movie.  I watched the widescreen version, which was in very good condition.  Extras include a trailer for the movie and a couple of very brief - under a minute per - period newsreels.",1120435200,,2254,4.75

Boyd is frightening as a psychopath, and Van Cleef, Salmi, and Silva are good as his disciples in evil. Collins is attractive and convincing as a rekindled former love.

Gregory Peck is sublime as the main character/hero and reminds the viewer of a day gone by when there were REAL movie stars. The story is very compelling and is aided well by the top notch musical score by Lionel Newmann  and Hugo Friedhoffer.( I have the cd soundtrack and it is beautiful) The supporting cast is great, with a very young Joan Collins, Stephen Boyd, Albert Salmi, Lee Van Cleef, Henry Silva, Andrew Duggan and Gene Evans. Their performances are very capable and you will particularly remember Stephen Boyds' character of Zachary: pure evil with no redeeming qualities. This contrasts very well with Henry Silvas' character as we see that he is basically a good man who fell in with the wrong group.  The camera work/scenery of the beautiful canyons and countryside is another plus for the film. The story has a great jolting twist at the end as Peck discovers the truth about his actions towards the group of outlaws he believes responsible for his wifes' rape and murder. ( Incidentally, the film is quite violent and graphic for 1958. Although not actually shown, a rape is strongly implied and is very disturbing.)

This is an increasing use of dishonesty by Amazon rather than telling buyers probably the most key piece of information about a DVD.  A couple years ago, the aspect ratio was usually clearly stated.

Then, the four escape,and Peck's character is sent after them.

This is a Western with heart, grit, and some surprises, and as Peck's Westerns often did, The Bravados doesn't just feature action, but goes in depth into the heart and mind of its characters.

The night before the hanging, the gang escapes town with a hostage.  Rancher Douglas and a town posse must go after them to try and bring them to justice.  This is a very exciting western that suprised me a bit with the twist ending, but it works here.  The movie is beautifully shot although I'm not sure where it was filmed.  For a western with a good cast and excellent shoot-outs, the Bravados is well worth a watch.
  Gregory Peck is excellent as rancher Jim Douglas who relentlessly pursues the men who he believes killed his wife.  This reminded me of his performance in The Gunfighter to a certain extent.  Joan Collins is pretty good in a small part as a townswoman who takes an interest in Douglas.  The gang who murdered Douglas' wife is played by Stephen Boyd, Henry Silva, Lee Van Cleef, and Albert Salmi.  The movie also stars Kathleen Gallant, Gene Evans, and Joe DeRita of Three Stooges fame.

I guess it made such a lasting impression because I was only nine years old and the combination of Gregory Peck's presence and the amazingly saturated colors of the film processing of the time made it a film I would always enjoy.  I am truly sorry for those who feel it is necessary to pick the film apart because the lack of realism but hey folks, it's called suspension of disbelief! I could watch Gregory Peck read the phone book for an hour & a half. He was a real movie star (remember those?)and a very good actor on top of that.  No one else could have done the job he did with ""On The Beach"" or ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".  This film certainly doesn't compare to those cinema classics but imagine how terrible ""The Bravados"" would have been without him.  This certainly is not a Hollywood classic, but it's an entertaining way to kill a couple of hours.  While it was shot in CinemaScope they always show the pan & scan version on tv. It drives me nuts because the first five minutes are shown widescreen then the p&s version takes over.  Hopefully the studio will release it on a budget priced dvd in anamorphic 2:35:1 for those of us who are fans.

This time around Peck plays Jim Douglass a rancher who rides into a small town the day before four men are due to be hung for murder. They fit the description of the men who some weeks earlier raped and murdered his wife. His hopes to see them hang are frustrated when they are rescued from jail and escape taking a young female hostage.
Douglass leads the pursuing posse and gradually the outlaw numbers are whittled down but a potent plot twist near the end causes Douglass to question the validity of his pursuit anfd the cost of his obsession.
My only reservations about the movie are to do with casting;Joan Collins is simply awful as the romantic interest .She looks uncomfortable on horseback and over emotes dreadfully .Peck was second to none as an actor at playing men of integrity and values;he could project goodness without seeming priggish or weak..Yet he never convinced me as a driven man ,one whose soul is torn asunder by loss and an aching drive for vengeance. Towards the end -when the charcater begins to see where his thirst for vengeance has lead him Peck is excellent but he failed to persuade  me in the earlier ,vengeance fuelled phase of his charcters development
All in all a striking Western but just short of classic status",1059177600,,1436,4.721115537848606

341811,4,6301528581,"This is a spare, tough, incisive movie of one man obsessed with revenge.  Gregory Peck is excellent in the role of Jim Douglass who takes the law into his own hands, burning to hunt down and kill the four men (three American, one Mexican) who raped and murdered his wife.  Peck is a one-man avenging army; he's grim and methodical as a killing machine, shoots down the criminals in cold blood, and chases the surviving suspect over the border to his home in Mexico; where he learns that, whatever crimes these lowlifes committed, and they were legion, the murder of his wife was not one of them.  He returns home to the cheers of the townspeople, desolated at the realization that he is as much a criminal as the men he hunted down, and he will have to live with his guilt for the rest of his life.  Joan Collins has a small but effective role as Josefa, an old friend who tries to rein in his all-consuming vigilantism; and the four outlaws, played by Lee Van Cleef, Albert Salmi, Stephen Boyd and Henry Silva, are excellent.  Silva is especially effective as the Mexican who shows Peck that, despite his criminal activities, he is a devoted husband and father who cares passionately about his own family.  There is no neat ending to this movie and we realize Peck is a flawed hero, if he is a hero at all.  It's a deep, thought-provoking film about revenge and misguided justice come home to roost.",985132800,,1400,4.509881422924901

341813,4,6301528581,"THE BRAVADOS is a moody, brutal piece of work that in many ways predates the cynical moods of later Westerns of the 60s and 70s. Gregory Peck stars a man bent on revenge against the four men who raped and murdered his wife.  The outlaws (Stephen Boyd, Albert Salmi, Henry Silva and Lee Van Cleef) are  in jail in Rio Arriba waiting to be hung, and Peck is there to witness the  deed. The prisoners escape, however, and Peck becomes an obssessed member  of the posse sent to hunt them down. This is another fruitful collaboration  between Peck and director Henry King, who also made THE GUNFIGHTER and  TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH together. This is NOT the Gregory Peck we know and  love! He is moody, sullen, full of anger and relentless in his pursuit of  the villains. The brutality of the film may come as a shock to viewers even  now, but its harshness makes it a precursor to the Sergio Leone/CLint  Eastwood films nearly a decade later. (The fact that Lee Van Cleef has a  major supporting role makes the connection even stronger.) There is also a  mean but logical twist in the tale that makes THE BRAVADOS one of the most  entertaining of 1950s Westerns.",941500800,,1154,4.516908212560386

7813347,4,6301528581,"RELEASED in 1958 and directed by Henry King, The Bravados stars Gregory Peck as Jim Douglas, a grim, laconic man chasing four outlaws who raped & murdered his wife and finds them in a Southwest jail slated to be hanged come morning, but they escape to Mexico as he leads a posse in pursuit. The thugs are played by Stephen Boyd, Lee Van Cleef, Henry Silva & Albert Salmi while Joan Collins and Kathleen Gallant are on hand in the feminine department.

Peck is effective as the one-note brooding protagonist. The score by Lionel Newman is surprisingly good for a 50s Western, a decade known for some hopelessly hokey Western credits songs and scores. Its interesting seeing Joan when she was so young (24 during filming) and Gallant is winsomely ravishing (no wonder Boyds wicked character was so enamored with her).

The film influenced other movies, like Bandolero! (1968), Death Wish (1974), and Sergio Leones Eastwood trilogy (and Spaghetti Westerns in general), although Leone of course exchanged realistic characters for cartoony caricatures. The entire first act of Bandolero! was taken from this film, although it had an amusing edge while The Bravados is deadly serious from beginning to end, which is good (it IS very realistic); but this also makes it somewhat tedious and I can see why some people don't like it. While theres an enlightening twist at the end, The Bravados isn't up there with Pecks best Westerns, like Duel in the Sun (1946) and The Big Country (1958); and its not as entertaining as How the West was Won (1962) or the comic booky MacKennas Gold (1969), but it definitely superior to the somewhat tiresome The Stalking Moon (1968).

THE MOVIE RUNS 98 minutes and was shot entirely in Mexico. WRITERS: Philip Yordan (script) & Frank O'Rourke (novel). ADDITIONAL CAST: Herbert Rudley & Ken Scott play the Sheriff and Deputy while Andrew Duggan appears as the padre.

GRADE: B

ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read unless youve seen the film)

Douglas (Peck) did not mistakenly kill three honorable law-abiding citizens; after all, they were sentenced to execution for robbing a bank and murdering the teller. In fact, as a member of a lawfully organized posse he was legally authorized to slay them. The message is not that Douglas did the wrong thing, but rather that he did the right thing for the wrong reason based on naively trusting his neighbors false information.",1507161600,,2413,4.945679012345679

7813349,3,6301528581,"Review of The Bravados
Hot Toasty Rag, August 24, 2017

I love Stephen Boyd, but he was destined to be typecast as a bad guy! In The Bravados, he plays the leader of a four-man gang who raped and killed Gregory Pecks wife. I guess when you're trying to make it in Hollywood, youll take any part they give you; and, if you're terribly good-looking, youll probably be offered bad guy parts. But the year before appearing as one of the most famous villains in Ben-Hur, it might not have been the best career move to take another bad guy role. Oh well. Any Stephen Boyd is better than nothing, I always say.

But back to the movie. Gregory Peck, grieving and angry, vows to avenge his wifes horrific murder. He tracks down the four men responsible, and they're waiting in jail to be executed for another crime. At the last minute, they escape, and Greg rides off, hot on their trail, determined to get his revenge.

If you like westerns, Gregory Peck, or revenge-fueled plots, be sure and rent this one. Those of you who don't like a gruesome rape and murder to be a central motivation of the plot might want to watch something else, but rest assured, it was made in 1958, so there won't be any graphic scenes. I liked this one, but then again, I was a little biased. Try it and see for yourself which hunky cowboy youll root for!",1503532800,,1326,4.382113821138211
