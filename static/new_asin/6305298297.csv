1037807,5,6305298297,"This collection is great! I currently have the four collections that are availible and plan to get the 5th on its release date(Feb. 25th). I happen to think there is no bad episode of the Twilight Zone, some are just much stronger than others. This collections ""strong"" episodes include: ""Little Girl Lost"", ""Stopover In a Quiet Town"", ""A Penny For your Thoughts"",""Twenty-two"", and ""Miniature"". Die-hards will notice two very rarely seen episodes in this collection: ""Sounds and Silences"" and ""The Encounter"". They will not be seen on TV again. Also, I'm a big fan of the new cases for this collection. I wish other DVD's were like them. If you have not picked up a collection yet, I will suggest Collection 1 because it contains the most classic episodes out of any collection like ""To Serve Man"" and ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet."" Die-hards must get this and it is strongly suggested to a casual Zone. So come on, step into the Twilight Zone on DVD!",1042156800,5,948,4.751515151515152
1037808,3,6305298297,Mr Dingle the Strong-Great episode! But in my opinion is the second best episode on this disc. Still every episode of Twilight Zone with Bergess Meredith is a good one. Two-Has always been one of my favorites. Stars Elizabeth Montgomery & Charles Bronson. These two episodes make the DVD worth buying. The other two episodes are good but not the best.,971827200,,351,4.770491803278689
1037984,5,6305298297,A great television show from my youth. Goodt acting and wonderful stories.,1406160000,,74,5.25
1037985,5,6305298297,"Even though it has been over 50 years since the first episode of ""Twilight Zone"" appeared on TV it is still one of the best series of all time. The entire Twilight Zone series has been released on a series of 45 DVDs containing 3 to 4 episodes on each DVD. They then split up the DVDs into box sets with 9 DVDs each, a total of 5 collection boxes. Collection 4 has the DVD volumes 28 through 36. Some of the better episodes in this collection include ""The Whole Truth"", ""Little Girl Lost"", ""I Am The Night--Color Me Black"", ""Jesse-Belle"", ""Miniature"", ""Printer's Devil"", ""A Stop At Willoughby"", ""Four O' Clock"" and ""Static"". The picture quality is very good on these discs which just makes is all the more enjoyable to watch. Anyone who is a fan of the show will want this and all the other collections in their video library. It is a true must have.",1389916800,,850,4.386075949367089
1037986,4,6305298297,I really love the old Twilight Zone series and Rod Serling. This Volume 4 edition was a real blast from the past and I did enjoy it.,1389744000,,132,3.925925925925926
1037987,3,6305298297,"Volume 4 from ""The Twilight Zone"" collection features four more episodes from the legendary series. Two of them I think are some of best episodes ever and two just so so at best. The first episode that appears on the disc is ""Mr Dingle, The Strong. Twilight Zone had done humorous episodes from time to time and ""Dingle"" was one of them. It would star Burgess Meredith, who starred in four episodes with ""Twilight Zone"" tying him with Jack Klugman for the most appearances, as a meek salesman who suddenly becomes the subject for experiments by extraterrestrial beings. The episode itself isn't that interesting and only mildly funny. It just doesn't compare with Meredith's other TZ episodes like ""Time Enough At Last"" or ""The Obsolete Man"".

The next episode is ""Two"". Not a great episode but would say it is very good one that only has two actors appearing in it. But what two actors they are. Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery. There is not much dialogue going on but Bronson and Montgomery are the only too soldiers left after a nuclear war has destroyed the world. Problem is they fought on different side. Now if the human race is to survive they will have to become the next Adam ana Eve if they can overcome their hatred for each other. The ending is a bit weak but it is a treat to see these two great actors working together.

The best episode on the DVD is the third one ""A Passage For A Trumpet"". It stars Jack Klugman, who as mentioned earlier is tied with Burgess Meredith for most appearances on the show. He gives an outstanding performance of a down on his luck trumpet player who feels no reason to go on living. Upon deciding to end his life Klugman's character meets another trumpet player who shows him the meaning to his life and gives him a second chance.

The last episode is ""The Four Of Us Are Dying"". In it a man has developed the ability to change his face to look like anybody he wants. At first of course he is able to use this to his advantage. But as always happens in the twilight zone fate causes his acquired powers to work against him. Just ask Mr Dingle! It is an OK episode but nothing really special about it.

So altogether this volume is good. Certainly for the diehard fan of the show this is a must have. For the more casual fan it would still be worth it to get if only for the two really good episodes that are on this disc.",1387411200,,2377,4.407744874715262
1037988,5,6305298297,"Rod Serling, et al, who worked on The Twilight Zone were terrific.  This helped complete my series 1 of this great show.  I have no complaints.",1385683200,,143,4.461538461538462
1037989,5,6305298297,"TWO with Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery from the third season is an excellent study in survival and mankind's need for human contact. The two are survivors of a nuclear holocaust on opposite sides of the initial conflict and discover much more than they ever imagined. This is another very memorable episode and both Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery give exceptional performances. It was written and directed by Montgomery Pittman. A classic episode. MR. DINGLE, THE STRONG is a neat little episode written by Rod Serling and directed by John Brahm from the second season where a timid little man (Burgess Meredith) is suddenly given superpowers to the dismay of his tormentor (Don Rickles). It is all an  experiment conducted by a two-headed Martian. A PASSAGE FOR TRUMPET seems like a role written just for Jack Klugman as he once again he plays a man who never made a success with his life. This time he is an unsuccessful trumpet player is given a second chance to get the recognition he so wanted. Jack Klugman is excellent in this episode written by Rod Serling and directed by Don Medford. Frank Wolff also has a nice little part. THE FOUR OF US ARE DYING is a compelling story about a man who can alter his face to look like anyone, but he somehow cannot escape his troubles. It was written by Rod Serling and directed by John Brahm. Interesting. I liked Don Gordon's part.",1380153600,,1399,4.757201646090535
1037990,5,6305298297,"There are five original box sets, and this seemed to be the hardest to come by.  This was much more expensive than the other four box sets.  But, just for the sake of completion, I obtained it.  Several very good episodes here.  Again, this is part of the original collection.  More recently they have ""remastered"" and repackaged the entire series-WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS A GOOD THING (i.e. I have always been opposed to unnecessary change).",1377993600,,437,4.773333333333333

1038080,4,6305298297,"Even though CBS released the ""definitive"" edition with even better picture and sound quality from the 35mm masters, and with extras, this set isn't bad for the price. In other words, you pay a few dollars more to get more, but if you are more interested in price then grab this box set.

One small note: I definately agree with other reviewers. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plus pages includes ""everything"" about the classic series and is a wonderful companion with the DVDs. The book details Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you. What you do is watch an episode and then read up on it in the book and you'll discover a wealth of trivia that makes this worthy of appreciation. Both the DVD set and the book is on Amazon.com so check it out (samples are available on Amazon's review page). Do yourself the favor and get both. You'll thank me for it.",1226016000,,1061,4.704301075268817
1038081,4,6305298297,"I spent over $800 on the VHS videos from Columbia House two decades ago. I spent less than $140 for the complete DVD set and discovered the value.
Sadly, while the quality and price is superb, the definitive set (also on Amazon) beats the quality and extras and price ten-fold.

However, the retail price keeps lowering over the months making this worthwhile if you don't want to spend the additional $5 bucks and get superior picture and sound quality and bonus extras.

I also suggest you buy ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD box set. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun. Regardless of whether you buy this set or the definitive box sets, watching the shows is one thing, knowing the behind-the-scenes stuff is even more fun. Both are available on Amazon.",1222128000,,964,4.732142857142857
1038174,5,6305298297,THERE IS NOT ONE TWIGHTT ZONE SHOW I DON'T LIKE AND THIS SEASON IS NO EXCEPTION...I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY IT!!,1190592000,,108,4.45
1038175,4,6305298297,"I have really enjoyed working my way through ""The Twilight Zone Collections 1-3"" but I felt a bit of a speed bump in Collection 4.  That decrease in quality I attribute to the fact that eight of the nine individual DVD's have an hour-long episode included with two half-hour episodes.  I guess I was a bit of a traditionalist even as a teen-ager because I knew when the hour-long format came out in 1963 that the the show wasn't as good anymore.  The success of ""The Twilight Zone"" was in its' ability to give us a compelling story within a half hour time slot.  What was apparent with the time expanded format was that the half-hour story was diluted with detail when extended the added half-hour.  Of the hour-long episodes in this collection, none are essential and only ""The Parallel"" and ""Mute"" made any really positive impression on me at all.  The phrase ""jumped the shark"" is a colloquialism that describes a point when a popular TV show tried to be more that its' fans wanted it to be.  It comes from an ""over the top"" episode of ""Happy Days"" and for me, ""The Twilight Zone"" jumped the shark when it went to the hour-long format.  It pains me to speak ill of my favorite TV show but alas, for me, it is the bitter truth.

Some lessor half-hour episodes are to be found in Collection 4 but there are some real gems as well.  We won't belabor the also-rans but focus instead on the essentials in this set.  ""The Whole Truth"" stars Jack Carson in a humorous episode about a used car salesmen who suddenly cannot tell a lie.  ""A Nice Place to Visit"" is one I always remembered as a discription of what Heaven is NOT like.  Another memorable episode is ""A Penny for your Thoughts"" that reminds us that perhaps the poet Bobby Burns was wrong; reading minds is NOT a good thing.  The premier episode of this collection is one that had me hiding anywhere BUT under my bed; ""Little Girl Lost"".  It has not lost its' cerebral sting after all these years.  ""Cesar and Me""  seems like a remake of an earlier episode (starring Cliff Robertson?) but is still worth watching.  ""Stopover in a Quiet Town"" is another memorable one that puts a twist on the old question ""Why are we here?""  ""Person or Persons Unknown"" gives us the view of the ultimate hangover and the effects of finally recovering from it.  ""A Stop at Willoughby"" serves as a reminder to be careful how hard you want to find a peaceful place to escape to.  Finally, there is ""The Rip Van Winkle Caper"" that wasn't quite as good as I remembered it but still wasn't too bad for an episode I've thought of off and on for 45 years.  That ought to be plenty to justify getting this collection but my math says we subtract 8 and add 16 to come up with an even better collection.",1173571200,5,2731,4.398406374501992
1038176,5,6305298297,"This is my all time favourite television show ever hands down!!!

the quality of storytelling is just fantastic,this is from an era where a few brave souls tried to approach the invention of television as a medium to host what were essentially televised plays...how low we have sunk nowadays with a hundred and one crass reality shows with unlikeable people and vulgar presenters polluting the airwaves.

I was particularly impressed with and highly reccomend the episode "" I am the night..colour me black"" I only just watched it last night and was blown away by it.

It was one of the most thoughtful,provoking and sensitive pieces of television regarding race relations I have ever seen and just another example of the superb scriptwriting that was

the shows trademark.

Also an example of just how radical the ideas and concepts that came out of the Twilight Zone could be especially when you consider the aforementioned episode was written and screened in 1963.

There are loads of other gems on this boxset and I simply cannot reccomend it or the Twilight Zone in general enough!!

I've just completed my Twilight Zone collection with all 5 boxsets and each one is a treasure to me because I highly doubt we'll ever get Television that good again.",1147392000,8,1253,4.854460093896714
1038177,4,6305298297,"Like the first 3 collections, this one has a great variety of episodes, and its fair share of A+ ones which are as fine as anything that has ever been shown on TV.  Unlike the first 3 collections, this one has several rarely seen and/or double length episodes, and is even more of an acquired taste.  Die-hard fans and collectors will want to own this set.  Those exploring TZ might try one of the other 3 collections first.  If you like, read my reviews of those as well.",1064275200,15,472,4.329545454545454
1038178,5,6305298297,"This is hands-down my favorite television series, and now it's on DVD in superlative form. You can't go wrong with any of the five collections.",1061596800,9,143,4.76
1038179,5,6305298297,"Having had a partial collection on video for many years now, I anxiously awaited the release on DVD. Finally! The complete series (156 episodes) has finally received the treatment it truly deserves. This series has held up well for 40+ years, and I have no doubt it will make it for at least another half century. Television writing was at its peak with this show, and the evolution of television filming (and videotaping) techniques is obvious over the course of this series. And the trademark twists at the end of each episode still take me by surprise!
Technically, the digital remastering to DVD has brought new life to Rod Serling's brainchild. The video presentation is crisp and well defined, bringing out the subtle details so well, that you will find yourself completely absorbed in the nuances of Serling's vision, and the outstanding production values for this early 60's series (just keep in mind that this is pre-Computer Generation era). The audio was clear, and blissfully noise free, but a bit low on the volume when compared to the title and menu audio tracks (both on the geyeballh version of the earlier disks, and the intro sequences on the later disks). The shows are presented in their original format, so no widescreen version is necessary. And television always translates well to...well, television. Although the extras include a Rod Serling bio, a brief synopsis of each of the 5 seasons that the series ran, and a Twilight Zone history, these features are identical on each disc. The true gem of the extra features is the episode synopsis and review. Each disc is unique in this respect, with a plot summary and some background ""inside info"". Although mostly taken from the book ""The Twilight Zone Companion,"" I found this feature to be the most interesting.
Each collection has its ghitsh and gmissesh, but the series is, overall, a rewarding experience. The only ""disappointments"" that I found were the collection's lack of a subtitles option (which I really would have appreciated), and the fact that the episodes are not in order (which slightly detracts from observing the actual progression of growth within the series). That makes this more of a 4 1/2 star rating (but you can't do that, can you?). If you have ever enjoyed even one episode of this legendary series, you will not regret buying these collections. And if you've never seen it, give it a try...you'll be hooked.",1055030400,9,2409,4.9068627450980395
1038180,3,6305298297,"Volume 4 features the various twists and turns that made the Twlight Zone famous, but this DVD does not impress as much as others will. In ""Mr. Dingle, the Strong,"" a saleman played by Burgess Meredith, realizes that he has been blessed with awesome strength (from Martians). The story fails, however, when the Martians take back the powers they gave only to give Dingle new powers that will lead to predictable results. ""Two"" is very interesting dramtically. Two survivors of a nuclear holocaust, Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson, find themselves alone in a barren town. Unfortunately, there is little conflict here, and while the Bronson and Montgomery do a fine bit of acting, there is not much story for them to perform; the ending is rather anti-climatic. In ""A Passage for Trumpet,"" Jack Klugman plays a trupet player who learns what it is like to be dead. This is possibly the best episode of Vol. 4. Possibly the most disappointing episode is ""The Four of Us are Dying."" Arch Hammer is able to change his face at a moment's notice, but in the Twilight Zone, such ""talent"" brings unexpected consequences. The ending is somewhat predictable and there is little to care for in the characters.
Overall the stories on this DVD have potential, but one suspects that given more time, they could have been polished further.",1048982400,7,1331,4.893805309734513
