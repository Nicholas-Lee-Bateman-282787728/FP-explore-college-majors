5891153,5,B00E5G03CU,Very good series I enjoyed Gentle Ben as a child. Now I can enjoy it with my children as well. They love it as much as I did when I was about their age. Enjoyable show for the entire family.,1400889600,,190,3.775

5891155,5,B00E5G03CU,Gentle Ben is a favorite of mine because some of the best actors star in it. Dennis Weaver is and all time favorite of mine. He does a fine job in anything he plays in. It is in a location that is beautiful and shows some of the best shots of natural habitat. It is a pleasure to watch little animals scurry around and watch the waterfowl. I love the air boats. Little Mark sure is a fine boy and sure loves Ben his bear. it is a series for children and the whole family. It is clean and decent and that's more than we can say for some others/,1397433600,9,543,3.9454545454545453
5891156,5,B00E5G03CU,"I remember this show fondly when I was a child growing up in Central Australia. There was always something happening and it was also wholesome entertainment, remember Ben, Mark, Dad and Mum (mom). Ben always got someone out of a pickle!",1392508800,,236,4.780487804878049
5891157,3,B00E5G03CU,"THERE WAS NO Internet research or Discovery Channel nature features for fact checking in the 60s. So, when we hear about a show  or remember it from the past  about a child and his pet black bear, it's understood nostalgia is involved.

An 8-year-old Clint Howard, brother to Ron of The Andy Griffith Show and big-time adult movie director, played Dennis Weavers son in Gentle Ben. It might be called a family fantasy series. Weaver plays a warden in the Florida Everglades, where he, his wife and son live with a free roaming, 650 pound black bear. The boy and his bear have adventures and teach lessons to the misguided people they meet along the way.

Weve seen in local news lately how black bears, their environment fading due to ever-encroaching suburbia, have entered neighborhoods in search of food. Theyre mostly young males, just looking for snacks, lady bears and a new home. We have all been cautioned to stay away from the claws and teeth  even as the bear takes to the trees to escape us.

Producers of Gentle Ben didn't have these concerns and probably thought having a big bear for a playmate was sound and fun.

Not much so for young Howard, who sometimes found himself mauled by the guest animals. We learn in commentary, a frightened raccoon made its escape over Howards chest, shoulders and arms once, leaving a shredded shirt and a bloody boy behind. After a trip to the ER, costumers made the child a vest of thin leather he could wear under his clothes for protection. In Florida. In the summer.

Other times, he would have a treat in his pocket or be smeared with something tasty to make a critter appear affectionate.

Howard, himself, seems more nostalgic relating his Gentle Ben memories. Older brother Ron guest stars with Clint in an early episode. Ron plays a bully who wants a bear of his own and will stop at nothing to get one. Clint recalls that Ron didn't play the bad boy very often, and seems delighted that it happened on his show.

Bet Sheriff Andy wouldn't have allowed Opie to have a big black bear for a pet.

There are 28 episodes on four discs in this set; its fuzzy video and mono sound show its age. Still, youngsters should love it; its fun to be the 8-year-old who teaches grown-ups a thing or two. As long as the grown-ups remember to keep them away from the wildlife.",1389830400,3,2317,4.545673076923077

5891167,5,B00E5G03CU,My three year old grandson LOVES this. I had read some reviews stating that the quality was not the best because it was not retouched from the 1967 shows. I totally disagree! The quality is fine and the shows are perfect for young children and their Grammies. I forgot how much I loved this show growing up. It's too bad shows like this are not made any longer. Great gift for the young ones!,1440633600,7,392,4.3108108108108105

5891172,5,B00E5G03CU,"""Gentle Ben"" is by far one of the very best TV shows that's ever been made.
It's such a fun, unique, underrated, adventurous and spectacular TV series and it has such beautiful scenery too.

Dennis Weaver was perfect in the role of the Florida Everglades Wildlife Officer named Tom Wedloe.
Beth Brickell was perfect in the role of Ellen Wedloe.
Clint Howard was perfect in the role of Mark Wedloe.

In this television series, Clint Howard's character had a lovable and tame black bear named Ben as a pet.

Such a large variety of animals are seen in both seasons of this classic television series.

All 28 episodes from Season One are presented in uncut and unedited form on this 4-disc set.
All 28 episodes from Season One have running times of over 25 minutes each on this DVD release.

The first season of this classic TV Series originally aired on CBS from September 10, 1967 until March 24, 1968.

The video quality is good and the audio quality is good too.

The packaging that CBS/Paramount used for Gentle Ben: Season One is perfect.
Season One is stored in a plastic DVD case that holds all four discs.
None of the discs share the same side of any of the disc holding trays and none of the discs overlap any of the discs either.

Notable guest stars from Season 1 were Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals, Albert Salmi, Arthur Roberts, Bruce Gordon,
Burt Reynolds, Claire Wilcox, Harry Bellaver, Howard Da Silva, Jay Silverheels, Juanita Moore, Murvyn Vye, Pat Hingle,
Ron Howard, Simon Oakland, Slim Pickens, Strother Martin, Stuart Erwin, Tom Poston and William Windom.",1428969600,10,1582,4.706521739130435

5891179,5,B00E5G03CU,"We don't watch network TV at my house because of the inappropriate, or scary commercials at all hours.  So I carefully select DVDs for my children to watch.  Gentle Ben is definitely family friendly!  If your family likes nature and positive role models with good moral lessons, you will like Gentle Ben.  The boy on the show speaks to his parents and all adults in a respectful manner.  The show is set in FL in the Everglades in the late 1960s.  In each episode, the boy gets into some kind of trouble and his pet black bear, Ben, saves him.  It's very similar to ""Lassie"" or ""Flipper"".  My 8 year old can't get enough of Gentle Ben!",1407974400,16,635,4.367521367521367
