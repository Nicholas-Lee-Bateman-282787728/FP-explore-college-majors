5689496,5,B00C33TL4S,"Ford was a great pictorial director whose portraits of the American West were powerful renderings of the  westering myth.  Yes, his films were often sentimental but nonetheless conveyed much that is distinctively American, and yes, they never failed to tell a good story.  This tribute was deserved.",1383264000,3,299,5.319148936170213
5689497,2,B00C33TL4S,"The video quality must have been awful before the re-master. It was good to see some of the off camera things and the stars. But the video quality is pretty poor,",1380153600,,162,4.258064516129032
5689498,4,B00C33TL4S,This is a great piece on one of the greatest directors ever.  John Ford brought terrific performances out of his cast and there is no picture of his that was bad.  This video offers a glimpse of his style and shows the respect his actors had for him.,1377043200,2,250,4.1875
5689499,3,B00C33TL4S,"It's an old documentary and not very detail on him, more fluff then anything else. It feels like a thank you and good bye by some of his big star actors that he had work with over his carrier.",1458000000,,192,3.948717948717949

5689504,3,B00C33TL4S,"First of all, this hasn't been ""remastered."" This is taken from the same old analog video master seen on various PD DVDs. Having said that, it's a must-see documentary. 3 stars because of the false advertising about being remastered.",1453507200,2,233,5.0

5689509,4,B00C33TL4S,"Is this old, yes.  Is this low quality video, yes  Is this loaded with insights about John Ford, kind of.  Is it great to see him talk with his greatest stars, Absolutely.  Nothing groundbreaking here but it sure is nice to have a glimpse into a filmaking time gone by.  I believe there is another more updated documentary somewhere out there.  But this will do for now.",1441065600,2,370,4.447761194029851

5689517,3,B00C33TL4S,"If you are looking for a documentary on legendary film maker John Ford, I suggest you make this your last stop.  Directed by John Ford is the superior film, there is also Becoming John Ford, and a couple of other wonderful documentaries on this 6 x Oscar winning director. Am I happy to own this though?  Yes, although the digitally remastered part should be taken with a grain (pun intended).  While the most excellent Directed by John Ford was dramatically remastered and updated , this wasn't in any way ... it should be called digitally transferred.  But I am happy to own this DVD-R as it does have some footage of Mr Ford, John Wayne, Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart I don't already own and as a big fan of them all and that era it lived up to my expectations.",1428278400,3,764,4.397163120567376

5689525,5,B00C33TL4S,"This man directed some of the greatest movies in the past. John Ford was a very interesting man. He made movies his way by pushing the actors in his films to portray the characters as he saw the story unfold.
The film shows the man & his type of movies & how he directed some of best actors around at that time.
