369079,4,6301802357,"Based on William Faulkner's sweetest novel, THE REIVERS (Paramount) is set in Mississippi, circa 1905.

Steve McQueen is Boon Hogganback, a cousin and handyman to the McCaslin family.  When grandfather ""Boss"" McCaslin buys a new car, a yellow Winton Flyer, Boon talks eleven year old Lucius, ""Boss's"" grandson, into his scheme to ""borrow"" the car for a quick trip to Memphis to visit a prostitute with whom he's in love.

When ""Boss"" leaves for the weekend, the two reivers -- an old fashioned word for ""thieves"" -- take off in the car. Unknown to them, a black relation has stowed away under a blanket in the back seat.  The four day odyssey is a coming of age adventure for young Lucius. He spends the night in a brothel, has a knife fight over a prostitue's honor, and races a horse to win back the car.

Beautifully photographed with one of John William's best scores, this fine film adaptation would probably delight Faulkner himself.  McQueen is memorable as a lovable scamp and he seems to be having fun in the role.

The narration, from the perspective of an adult Lucius, is by Burgess Meredith and the poetic, wise words are Faulner's.

This wonderful, mostly forgotten film is worth seeking out.",1117756800,14,1206,4.7368421052631575
369080,5,6301802357,"William Faulkner was one of America's greatest authors.  His Pulitzer Prize winning works are renowned for his ability to capture, with affection and fascination, the culture and people of Mississippi...Southerners of all  color, class, and gender.  Many of Faulkner's stories evoke a somber tone  of Southern Gothic tragedy based on his observations of racial intolerance,  and the decline of traditional Southern values before the forces of greed  and modernization.  In contrast to his more serious works, ""The  Reivers"" is light-hearted, comic, and thoroughly entertaining.
The  movie captures, with rich authenticity, the colorful characters of  Faulkner's Mississippi.  The cinematography and music evoke the sites and  sounds of a picturesque South in 1905.  The cast, including  narration by  Burgess Meredith, is impeccable.  The movie centers on the joyriding  adventures of 11-year old Lucius McCaslin, his cousin Boon Hogganback  (Steve McQueen) and their black relation (Rupert Crosse).  The story  involves a stolen car, a 4-day odyssey from northern Mississippi to the  `red light"" district of Memphis, a horse race, and the life-changing  experiences of young Lucius.  Will Geer, as Lucius' grandfather  ""Boss,"" offers a memorable performance when he confronts the  young boy with his misdeeds, proving again that the word is mightier than  the hand.  William Faulkner would be proud of this movie.",950572800,66,1414,5.609523809523809

In Mississippi at the turn of the 20th century, and it's where we find a grand and spectacular ""horseless carriage"" that is a shiny yellow 1905 Winton Flyer automobile. Its owner is Mississippi plantation owner ""Boss"" [Will Geer], who has left it sitting unattended. But hired hand Boon Hogganbeck [Steve McQueen] decides it would be the ideal vehicle to take him and his buddy on a glorious whirlwind jaunt to distant Memphis. And along for the ride is Boss's earnest 12-year-old grandson, who finds himself reluctantly drafted to be the third ""reiver"" (an old Scottish word for 'thief') aboard his grandfather's car. So starts a bumpy journey that sweeps the trio into encounters with both Boss's raucous gal pal at a brothel and a corrupt racist sheriff, as well as a spellbinding, winner-takes-all horse race with ownership of the Winton Flyer at stake!

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE REIVERS [1969] is a nice bawdy film, with a sort of Walt Disney theme with an adult rating. Imagine a charming nostalgia-soaked family-type film about a winsome 11-year-old in turn-of-the-century Mississippi, where Boon Hogganbeck [Steve McQueen], conspires to borrow the car, taking Lucius McCaslin [Mitch Vogel] with him. Stowed away is Ned McCaslin [Rupert Crosse]. The three head for Memphis, where Boon Hogganbeck's sweetheart works in a bordello, where Ned McCaslin trades the car for a racehorse, where Lucius McCaslin discovers the world of adults, from racism and vice to possibilities of honour and courage, where in the process he gets himself cut up in a Memphis bordello defending the good name of a lovely professional lady. But is their redemption for the reivers rascals, and a happy outcome? But most importantly the film is beautifully narrated by Burgess Meredith, who is the older character of Lucius McCaslin, and is helped brought to a brilliant screen presentation, by the brilliant adaption of the Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novel by William Faulkner.

As one of the top male stars of the late 1960s, Steve McQueen was in the position to choose any role he wanted, including the classic film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid [1969], which he turned down reportedly over a billing dispute with the actor he considered one of his principal rivals, which was Paul Newman. Steve McQueen certainly could have played it safe by sticking to the action roles that had placed him among the top ten box office performers. Instead, he chose THE REIVERS [1969], a comic, nostalgic tale based on William Faulkner's final novel, which earned the author his second Pulitzer Prize.

The story, set in 1905, and centres around a wealthy rural Mississippi family, the McCaslins, and their prized possession, a brand new, bright yellow Winton Flyer automobile, the first car owned by anyone in the community. While the family patriarch is away, due to the death of one grandfather, which eventually puts most of the family on a train to attend the funeral including the other grandfather who happens to own the conveyance that provides the impetus for four days of mayhem, which was bought only because grandfather or Boss as he is called by employees and family alike decided he needed to own shiny yellow 1905 Winton Flyer automobile ""horseless carriage,"" but is spirited off for a carefree 4 day road trip by hired hand Boon Hogganbeck [Steve McQueen], grandson Lucius McCaslin [Mitch Vogel], and alleged distant cousin Ned McCaslin [Rupert Crosse], a mixed-race young man found on the property as a child and taken into the family. The trio take the car to Memphis, where the young Lucius McCaslin has some wild adventures with his adult companions and learns important lessons about racism and vice but also about honour, redemption and love.

THE REIVERS [1969] is exceptional; especially Mark Rydell is a brilliant master visual storyteller, and his dynamic but subtle use of the frame to tell his story is timeless. The story itself, however, feels a little old fashioned with films that would have been made today, but despite this, it is still a lovely moving film where they experience a number of mostly minor misadventures of Boon Hogganbeck [Steve McQueen], Lucius McCaslin [Mitch Vogel], Ned McCaslin [Rupert Crosse], and the wonderful and spectacular ""horseless carriage"" of the shiny yellow 1905 Winton Flyer automobile. But without warning Ned McCaslin [Rupert Crosse], mistakenly trading the car for a horse, which they then need to race in order to get the ""horseless carriage"" of the shiny yellow 1905 Winton Flyer automobile back and here we get to the real climax of this wonderful moving film in that it makes you really cheer and punch your fist in the air in wanting and shouting at the screen in wanting Lucius McCaslin [Mitch Vogel] to win the race, which is helped with the devious Ned McCaslin in finding the horses that has a hidden secret and you will have to watch the Blu-ray to find out the outcome of the race, but I can tell you it will gladden your heart. Its a really lovely charming light funny tale, and one that is so slavishly devoted to its sense of period that recreates the 1912, and it feels like it could have been made in 1912, but of course it is filled with beautiful colour and wonderful sound, to make you forget it was set in the period of the middle of the 20th century.

Despite the films seems slightly dated, but instead the film has some beautiful qualities that still keeps working for todays modern audiences, which is all brought to fruition by the brilliant talented director Mark Rydells and of course it the films excellent cast compensates for the films sometimes weak spots. Rupert Crosse was rightly nominated for an OSCAR for his work in the film and Steve McQueen is as always is always charismatic as ever in the lead. And another justified OSCAR nomination went to the superb and brilliant score by John Williams, whose early composition a few years before where John Williams would go on to massive fame with JAWS and STAR WARS. But most important is that John Williamss score is one of the main reasons to watch this beautiful film, and its beautifully served by the brilliant 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo mix.

Blu-ray Video Quality  THE REIVERS is brought to you via Kino Lorber with a very nice encoded 1080p image, with a really nice 2.35:1 [Panavision] aspect ratio. Despite where they acquired the master, you get quite a nice fine looking transfer that is given a clean crisp upgrade for the high-definition Blu-ray release. The film seems to been deliberately shot in an intentional dream-like haziness image presentation, so details can appear a bit soft every now and again, but despite that, the colours are very vibrant, but still with a natural look. The black levels at times are very strong with a nice sense of depth, especially when you view the darker scenes of Memphis. So overall it is a very good presentation. The visual presentation is top-notch as well, with a wide range of vibrant colours in this period piece production design perfectly balanced against accurately reproduced skin tones.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  With the audio presentation of THE REIVERS you get a very nice 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo, that has lots of beautiful resonant that brings the best out of the film and what was also really nice is the pleasant sounds of the sputtering engine of the Winton Flyer automobile. The Dialogue is also very crisp and clear, which is always in the centre of the screen. But what really stands out is the brilliant John Williams amazing film score, which is given the right ambience and doesnt overpower everything. Despite a stereo mix, it would have been so nice to have an upgrade with a 5.1 DTS-HD Surround sound mix. But despite this, it was a very enjoyable sound experience.

Finally, THE REIVERS was a much unknown film of Steve McQueen for me especially and is a really wonderful hidden gem, and is a very valuable entry into anyones Blu-ray Collection, and THE REIVERS is now in my viewed as a really truly classic film. THE REIVERS film starts out very slowly and I nearly gave up, but I persevered and was well rewarded, as it features a brilliant talented cast at the top of their game, catering to a really nice sweet sentimental story with of course a fantastic classic film score by John Williams. Although Kino Lorber has done an quite a good job, but the only thing this company really annoys me with is that they will not include any extras, as I am sure there are some hidden gem documentaries, especially of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew. But despite this anomaly, this Blu-ray is such a wonderful and beautiful enjoyable family, this transfer will likely be the best we can expect from this Blu-ray release for the foreseeable future. Highly Recommended!

I suppose i would suggest that if you plan to read and watch that you see the film first- the first 1/2 of the book is the history of the family and the flavor of N. Mississippi. Its a challenging read but the stories and humor (laugh out loud) make it all worth while.
There is a whole lot of misconception about Southern Culture. I think anyone who might want to get a glimpse into the more evolved kinships of affection and respect among all the southerners would find this book a bit enlightening. Faulkner doesn't pander to stereotype (with the possible exception of the small town lawman who likes to throw his weight around) and the characters are rich and multifaceted.",1391731200,,939,4.465116279069767

Director Mark Rydell's, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Golden-Pond/dp/B002UM1ROO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Golden Pond</a>), 106 minute classic comedy/ drama, which was nominated for two Oscars, is set in turn of the twentieth century rural Mississippi. It is based on a novel by William Faulkner, Nobel-Prize-winning twentieth century Southern American writer and screenwriter, who also had a hand in writing the screenplay.  In this charming coming of age film, an old man, voiced by Burgess Meredith, narrates a tale of his youth.

As a naive 11 year old, Lucius McCaslin (Mitch Vogel) had an unlikely friend in Boone Hoggenbeck, (Steve McQueen), his family's ne'er-do-well handyman, and confirmed philanderer. Boone, and his mixed-race best friend, Ned McCaslin, (Rupert Crosse, in his final theatrical film), who is cousin to Lucius, drag Lucius along as they take advantage of the brief absence from town of Lucius's grandfather, known as Boss to one and all, who is traveling to a family funeral by train.  They `borrow' the snazzy new car Boss (played by Will Geer, enjoying the role of his life) had just bought, and head for the neighboring big city of Memphis, Tennessee, where Lucius enjoys all sorts of adventures and gets a head start on growing up.

McQueen, a great star of the 1960s and `70s, who left us much too soon, was, for certain, always the essence of cool.  He was also a very skilled driver, whom people loved to watch as he did his thing, without stuntmen, see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bullitt/dp/B001F4UHGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bullitt</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Escape/dp/B000IZZS5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Escape</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Mans/dp/B004R6JG7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Mans</a>.  He does some driving here too, of course, but only in the brand-new, bright yellow, 18-horsepower Winton Flyer.  According to the Internet Movie Database, ""The Winton Flyer was not a real automobile. It was created from scratch for this movie by Kenneth Howard, aka Von Dutch. The car was designed to resemble a typical vehicle from 1904, but built to withstand the rigors of filming. Steve McQueen called the car `the real star of the picture', and took possession of it after filming ended. It remained in his collection until his death in 1980. It can be seen in the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.""

Among the supporting players, Ruth White, who also died shortly after making the film, turns in strong work as Miss Reba, a brothel madam, as does Michael Constantine as Mr. Binford, its owner. Further according to IMDb, ""On the packaging for the 1993 VHS release of the movie, the music credit is given to Lalo Schifrin. John Williams wrote the score for the film and received an Oscar nomination for his efforts.""

Oh yes, and that title, ""The Reivers.""Apparently an old-fashioned local word for thieves.  Mind you, before recently seeing this movie again, I'd not seen it for many years, possibly since its theatrical release.  But I remember very clearly going to see it with my father - my mother believed that it wouldn't be politically correct enough for her.  A funny point of view in that one of the points the picture makes is the bullying and exploitation of the weak by the powerful.  But my father, a man of great charm and charisma himself, who had a secret sentimental streak a mile wide, which I'm afraid I inherited from him, was in tears at several points of the picture.  Be forewarned: this picture of a vanished age is charming and heart-warming as can be.",1376438400,,3768,5.597539543057996

369531,5,6301802357,"What a totally refreshing film and a complete surprise. I knew nothing about this film. Steve McQueen is on the DVD cover with an old time car. That was all I knew.

THE REIVERS is a change of pace for super star Steve McQueen who was at the height of his career when he filmed the REIVERS. He stars as Boon Hoggenbeck, a farm hand in Mississippi who takes a shining to his boss's new fangled car in the early 1900's. The boss just happens to be called BOSS an irascible old soul played by Will Geer. While BOSS is away Boon decides to take the car and his two cousins to the wild town of Memphis. His cousin Lucius is a well-behaved and innocent 11 year old and they are joined by their African-American cousin. (There is a great-grandparent in common.  They leave the peaceful innocence of their small town for a taste of the real world.

Boon's destination is a ""house of ill-repute"" where his special lady works. The story has a very odd combination of people and situations yet there is an endearing charm to this story that is part drama and part slapstick as our trio gets into various trouble.

Mitch Vogel was a child actor of the late 60's and 70's that led to a stint on TV's BONANZA. It is amazing to see what a wonderful actor he was. His ability to cry and show emotion and he totally steals the movie. I've read that Steve McQueen was insecure and needed to be the ""star"" but yet he lets Vogel shine in this film that turns out to be a heartwarming coming of age story of a young boy's first experience with the outside world. There are several beautiful scenes of Vogel interacting with Boon's girl and with kindly, elderly African-American Uncle Possum. These are real people interacting with genuine affection and respect. All color and social barriers are lifted for a while. Unfortunately, not everyone is squeaky clean and we glimpses of the ugly side of racism.

Lucius learns about the real world and becomes a man at an early age. He tells his first lies yet he is keenly aware of his mistakes and his heart is never hardened. There is an absolutely beautiful and moving scene between Boss and Lucius that has to be one of the most lovely and heartwarming interaction between an adult and child I have ever seen on screen.

This is the firt film where I have seen Steve McQueen actually sing--not lip singing as in BABY THE RAIN MUST FALL. Singing is not one of his talents, but McQueen throws his heart into it and its all pure joy. It seems like McQueen is actually loving every minute of this film. Don't miss it.",1343606400,2,2540,4.416666666666667
369532,3,6301802357,"An old man recalls the halcyon days of his youth and the four days that changed his life forever.  The time is 1905, and 11-year old Lucius (Mitch Vogel) lives with his rich grandfather in a sleepy Mississippi town.  His wild and no-account pals, Boon (Steve McQueen) and Ned (Rupert Crosse), talk him into a wild adventure involving his grandfather's shiny, new automobile, some shady ladies, and a horse race.

As a Steve McQueen fan, I expected to love this movie, but, although he's charming as always, he seems more of a secondary character here.  The story focuses on Mitch Vogel's character and he's a good, but not great child actor; his eyes are expressive and thoughtful, but he sounds like he's reading his lines. Will Geer (who plays the grandfather) and Sharon Farrell have the best scenes.  The story was clearly meant to be a rollicking good time but it didn't make me smile.  It's big on nostalgia and family values but this is definitely not a child-friendly movie.

I liked the period recreation, sets, and costumes, but the story just missed the mark for me; it didn't hold my interest with McQueen playing a rather helpless fool.  Just an okay film.",1327622400,6,1169,4.724137931034483

It was a time when as seen in this movie right from the start how kids of any age could learn to drive just by being taught on the spot like the 11 year old boy Lucius was and he and the 2 men find that they have a very big bond growing between them as the movie proceeds with them taking on a series of adventures in Lucius' Grandfather's car. This is a very good family film as well as a very much so under appreciated gem. Watch for Will Geer as The Grandfather called Boss and before he was made famous as Grandpa Walton. It was also very interesting for me to find out that this is another work of William Faulkner's outside of ""As I lay dying.""which I'd read in my American Lit Class in 1984.

369644,4,6301802357,"Based on a William Faulkner novel, The Reivers is a big departure from the typical Steve McQueen movie and maybe that's why it's not hugely well-known, but don't let that scare you away from a good old-fashioned movie.  In 1905 in Jefferson, Missouri, 11-year old Lucius McCaslin is starting to grow up and see the world differently.  When a distant relative of the family dies, Lucius' parents travel to go to the funeral leaving their son behind.  Joining up with his friend Boon, a family friend who works as the family handyman, and Ned, a black man who has blood relations to the family, Lucius and Co. ""borrow"" his dad's new car and take it up the road to visit Memphis.  Along the way, young Lucius begins to see things even more differently as he's exposed to new things, thanks in great part to the sticky situations Boon and Ned get him into.  The plot drifts along through the movie, taking its time and introducing characters along the way.  It's a good movie, pure and simple, and there's a good message at the end of it.  Not your typical McQueen movie by a long shot, but that doesn't mean it's not a very good movie.

 In a part different from just about any other role he played, Steve McQueen plays Boon Hogganbeck, a family handyman who just enjoys living and doing what he likes to do.  McQueen didn't do many comedic roles, and this isn't straight comedy, but he's good here in a physical role that brings more than a few shares of laughs.  Mitch Vogel plays Lucius, the 11-year old friend of Boon's who truly begins to grow up on the little road trip and finding out who he really is.  It's a very good part for Vogel who disappointingly didn't go on to bigger and better roles.  Rupert Crosse is very good as well as Ned, a black man working for the McCaslin family who can trace his family bloodlines back to Lucius' grandfather.  Boon and Ned grew up together which gives McQueen and Crosse plenty of humorous moments throughout.  Sharon Farrell stars as Miss Corie, Boon's longtime love working at a local whorehouse.  Lucius takes an instant liking to her, almost like a big sister, and starts getting her thinking about changing her life around.  The excellent supporting cast includes lots of small cameos including Will Geer, Ruth White, Michael Constantine, Dub Taylor, Clifton James, and Juano Hernandez.  The four main leads all give good performances, but the supporting cast helps make the movie even stronger overall, including Burgess Meredith as Lucius as an adult, narrating the story and looking back on the adventure.

The DVD is pretty slim in the special features department, as in none, so don't expect even a trailer or still gallery.  Fortunately, the widescreen transfer is a good one which is how this movie deserves to be seen. So don't be scared that this isn't a well-known Steve McQueen movie if you're curious as to watch it or not.  Don't expect the loner role that McQueen perfected, it is definitely a change of pace for the actor, but that's what makes it worthwhile.  Give The Reivers a try!",1202601600,,3049,4.649253731343284

He displayed a breezy charm of which I hadn't before thought he was capable. Second, the film was presented in a classic ""feel-good"" tradition which went against the increasing cynicism of that Counter-Culture/Viet Nam war era. The visual look of ""The Reivers"" wonderfully captures our idea of the period in which it takes place.

William Faulkner wasn't known for his lightness of heart, but this precious memoir shows love, spirit and excitement that sets this film aside. I won't blab away the plot, but Steve McQueen, at the height of his career, is having a ball in a fine performance. Sharon Farrell is so lovely; where did her career go? Mitch Vogel, as young Lucius, gives one of the best kid performances ever; I hate bad kid-actors. Where did his career go? And the most auspicious debut performance came from Oscar-nominated Rupert Crosse, knowing everything, wanting to be included, causing the most trouble, and, ultimately, saving the day. Best in the film! And where did his career go? There's also the great Juano Hernandez, and a really great performance by a horse. And it's always good to see Ruth White, the most reliable character actress since Jane Darwell. Non-obtrusive narration by Burgess Meredith is a plus. The odds seem insurmountable, but they all emerge victorious and young Lucius has life-affirming experiences; shocking, painful and ultimately exciting. And memorable. This film is nothing but fun, and I enjoy it a lot. 1969 brought about some magnificent films: Midnight Cowboy, Anne of the Thousand Days, They Shoot Horses Don't They, Butch Cassidy...and The Reivers is right up there with the best of 'em.",1135209600,34,1533,5.039370078740157

Don't hesitate one minute to buy the dvd,even if there are no bonus features.",1123459200,3,553,4.711340206185567
369708,5,6301802357,"They finally put this wonderful movie on DVD. An easy, kick-back movie to enjoy about a boy growing up in slower times in the early 1900's in the South. It touches on a wide variety of human traits, from foibles such as discrimination and deceit to good qualities like respect and forgiveness. The stable scene about quitting is a terrific lesson for all of us and especially for youngsters. The basement scene between the grandfather and the boy (""I could smell the starch in his shirt"") is a priceless teaching tool without using the strap. Simple and straightforward with a little comedy sprinkled throughout with wonderful narration by Burgess Meredith, you feel pleasantly satisfied at the end that you just finished watching a great movie.",1120780800,5,745,4.968
369709,5,6301802357,"From the wonderful story narration by Burgess Meredith to the acting of this fine cast this movie has a sweet charm. William Faulkner's book may be in more depth, but the screenplay and direction make up for it in many ways. You truly feel you are with them at the beginning of the 20th Century. This is one of Steve McQueen's finest performances. McQueen plays a relative that talks the Patriarch's grandson into ""borrowing the car"" to take a trip to Memphis. This is a far different road trip movie than those today. This will appeal to most the family because it has a warmth of spirit and adventure. The DVD is clear and sharp. I recommend this to any one that enjoys movies based on books about a way of life in another time. The music, costumes, sets, and scenery are top class. The story telling style reminded me of classics like ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", but this is a much lighter movie.",1119830400,6,896,4.469512195121951
369710,5,6301802357,"I've never read William Faulkner's source novel for this film but I'm sure he would be receptive to it.  Steve McQueen is the ostensible star here as Boon, a ne'er do-well hired hand.  McQueen gives a light-hearted performance here but he also graciously acquiesces the spotlight to the rest of the film's cast.  McQueen intuitively knows that this film is essentially about the coming-of-age of an 11 year old boy, Lucius McCaslin,(Mitch Vogel) in Jim Crow South circa 1905.  The film starts out bucolic, showing the everyday goings on of a small Mississippi town where everyone knows their place under the firm but fair hand of ""Boss McCaslin(Will Geer).  While the boss is away at a family funeral, Boon hatches a plan to take a road trip with Lucius to Memphis in the boss' prize automobile.  Stowing away in the back seat is Boon's partner-in-crime, Ned(Rupert Crosse).  Boon's plan is to give Lucius the ""education"" he would not receive at home.  What Lucius does witness is prostitution, random violence, and institutional racism.  As entertaining a film this is these underpinings add a certain wistfulness to the proceedings.  It's a heavy burden for a young actor to carry but Vogel is up to the challenge.  One of the most powerful images in the film is his admission at the end of the film to his grandfather the guilt he feels for his transgressions.  Aside from the aforementioned actors, who are all superb, good work is contributed here by Sharon Farrell as a prostitute with misgivings about her profession and Clifton James as a racist lawman.  Despite certain thematic elements in the film I would highly recommend it to mature young adults.",1118793600,5,1660,4.885714285714286

7815907,5,6301802357,Steve McQueen at his best.  If you are used to watching Steve McQueen in serious dramatic or action roles you will be surprised in this comedy.  He is very good.  He is running around in one of the first automobiles in an adventure story.  Just a whole lot of fun.  Great movie to watch for an enjoyable evening.,1523836800,,312,4.310344827586207

7815909,3,6301802357,I saw this at a drive inn.  And while I was watching it a fight broke out.  That distracted from the movie.  So I don't remember when it was that I actually saw this all the way through.  Steve McQueen was my favorite actor and this was the first movie he made after Bullitt. It is pretty different then just about any thing else he did.  Set in Mississippi in 1905 he and a young boy and another  black man steal the boy's Grand father's car and go to Memphis.  Along the way is one of my favorite scenes when they come to mud hole.  Then when they get there the black man trades the car for a horse.  They plan on winning the car back in a horse race.  Only to find out the horse is slow.  And loves sardines.  The story is really about the lessons learned growing up.  Everybody in the movie doesn't really seem to be acting but are having a good time.,1515628800,,855,4.047904191616767
