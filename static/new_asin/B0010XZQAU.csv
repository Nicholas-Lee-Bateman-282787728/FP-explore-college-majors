8239450,4,B0010XZQAU,"This play, about a secondary, but vital player in the real, historical Passion of Christ, gives the viewer a sympathetic portrait of a profoundly decent, honest man, tormented by what he has been forced by the law he administers as Roman Council to do -- condemn a man he knows to be innocent to a horrible death.
  Pilate is also a man deeply in love with his wife, Procula (later Saint Procula), who leaves him to become a follower of Christ.  In Act III he finds her again, only to be forced, again by law, to sentence her to die by crucifixion.  Pilate, hearing her screams, cannot endure it, and stops the execution, but then commits suicide by falling on his sword (something NOT unusual in the Roman world.  In fact, he may have been ordered by the Emperor Caligula, to do so.)
  Geraldine Fitzgerald gives a moving performance as Procula; Cyril Ritchard is maganificent in the title role -- a performance as far from Captain Hook as it is possible to get.  He portrays Pilate as more than just a Roman apparatchik, but as a good and decent man who lives by and loves the law he administers, and is tormented by the fact that he had no choice but to sentence Jesus to death.  He knows He is innocent, and leans over backward to give Him a chance  to defend Himself -- to no avail.
  Ritchard gives an appearance so haggard and exhausted as to be virtually unrecognizable -- until he speaks, and we hear his unmistakeable voice.  The secondary characters are also well drawn (including the small part of Pilate's second wife, played by Ritchard's real-life wife, Madge Elliott.)
  The costumes cost the production a fifth star.  Not only are they uniformly ugly, (except for Pilate's armor in the last act, which was, at least ,historically accurate.) My pet peeve -- ZIPPERS!  Zippers in 33 A.D.?????  Puh-LEEEZE!!!!!
  There are a few other technical quibbles -- the sound quality in places leaves something to be desired, and the film editing is, at times, uneven and jerkey.
  Would I reccomend this film?  It depends --  moving performances on the part of the protagonists; it is an interesting subject -- what became of Pontius Pilate after his brief appearance on the stage of history, BUT production issues that leave a lot to be desired, and, quite frankly, a very dated appearance.
  I leave it to the potential viewers.",1380672000,,2336,4.66421568627451
