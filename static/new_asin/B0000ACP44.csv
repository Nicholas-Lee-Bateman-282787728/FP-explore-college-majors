1904750,5,B0000ACP44,"The title for this review will probably be your first reaction upon seeing this short film. Though considered Japanese animation, little in it looks like it. The story itself plays out silently, accompanied by music and squeaks from the characters. In truth very little in this movie makes any sense. One way to describe it is: If Stanley Kubrick made an animation, this might be it.

But it's still an excellent film. Cat Soup is about two kittens. One of the kittens, named Nyaaka, gets sick and has her soul removed by Death, but before all of the soul is removed, Nyatta, Nyaaka's brother, catches and breaks a piece of the soul, saving Nyaaka from death... barely. She becomes an emotionless creature with a dead look to her large eyes. So Nyatta decides to find his sister's soul. In his journey, he drags his near-dead sister to many places, from a bizarre circus to a tiny, dark river, with many strange, magical, and sometimes disturbing places in between.

The things that happen to the characters of this short seem almost random, giving the feeling of constant surprise to Cat Soup. Following the characters, you wonder where in the world they could get to next Just when you realize they are at their next destination you begin to want Nyatta and Nyaaka to move on. Danger meets them in every place they go, whether from a physical thing or from the weather. And then, of course, there is the scene where you see the namesake of the film...

When all put together, it makes for a surprisingly tense and entertaining piece of short animation. The problem with this movie is that it is easily misunderstood. Where one person believes its magical, another thinks its crap. All I can say is give it a try, rent it if possible, or buy it if you're a collector. I'm sure that if you watched it without a critical eye, you'll find your own measure of enjoyment from Cat Soup.",1137974400,15,1881,4.608955223880597
1904751,3,B0000ACP44,"Cat Soup seems to have a little following behind it, as seen by it's perfect 5 average. However, while the movie is a sight to see, and worth your time, this isn't anything to run out and buy. Heres the scoop:

Story goes like this (what there is of one... We're told many conflicting things): Nyaako is on her death bed. But when death takes her soul, her little brother wrestles it away. Most of it, anyway. They head out on a journey that starts off as shopping for tofu, then on a head trip through the 'after life'. Or something.

Anyway, this animated short only runs for 45 minutes, and contains an extreme amount of symbolism. From God eating the planet, to the cats eating a friendly pig on noah's ark and drinking an elephant, you won't know whats going on at first. But, there is some stuff that can help you figure it out. Which leads me to...

Special features! Actually, there are only two. There's an audio commentary with the director, but he doesn't always explain the reasoning behind the imagery. Also, there's an interview with him, where he talks about his inspiration for the piece. Otherwise, only some trailers.

The language options are english and japanese, but considering there is no spoken words besides mumbling. And word bubbles.

The problem lies in the transfer. The video quality is late eighties cartoons, and spotting, and blocks appear all over. Darks are gray/blue, too, instead of... black. Audio is okay, but the music fades a little sometimes.

Overall, a decent movie that's plauged by it's length, quality, and many people will be turned off by the bizarro settings and premise. But those with an open mind, and anyone who doesn't immeadiately go ""Oh no! A Foreign movie!!!"" will probably trip balls on this little diddy, and maybe even get something deeper out of it.",1132012800,5,1811,4.715189873417722
1904752,5,B0000ACP44,"Insert ""Hello Kitty"" into ""The Grateful Dead Movie"" and you have an idea -- sort'a, kind'a -- of what a short, strange trip this film is!  Two cute kitty siblings enter a limbo between life and death, while trying to recover one's soul.  There they experience numerous bizarre, occasionally gory, disconnected adventures.  There is little dialogue other than word balloons, and most seemingly nonsensical.  But this is not merely acid-induced weirdness; there's a story in this imagery that will stick in your mind long after watching it.  For those who like Japanese animation and ""Cat Soup"" in particular, I recommend finding tol's  ""Tamala 2010: A Punk Cat in Space.""  ""Tamala"" features another cutie cat-girl, with a penchant for four-letter words, and a propensity toward violence and freaky adventures.  Like ""Cat Soup,"" ""Tamala"" has fantastic art and imagery; plus it boasts a mindblowing soundtrack.",1123977600,8,907,5.293706293706293
1904753,5,B0000ACP44,"Wow.  After seeing this on the back of my magazine cover, and hearing it described as ""Hello Kitty"" on acid, I decided to check it out.  And all I can say is: WOW.  It is a great short film, and very thought-provoking.  Even after watching it several times, there are things I discover that I previously had missed.  I would recommend this to anyone with an open-mind, a love for niche anime titles, or a strange sense of humor.  I would not recommend it for children under the age of 14, however.  Despite the cute cats on the cover, it is a tad bit bloody, and the youngun's probably wouldn't sit through this mature anime, anyway.",1068249600,4,633,4.405172413793103
1904754,5,B0000ACP44,"Cat soup is basically about a young cat trying to get his sister's soul back, or his sister's dream while she is sick. You can interpret  it any way. Either way it has an odd assortment of er...adventures, like the water elephant incident.
This DVD is very, very random, so if you don't like random stuff, then you shouldn't buy this. But if you do, go ahead. You'll probably enjoy this. I know I did.",1065830400,,401,4.346666666666667
1904755,5,B0000ACP44,"Watching this short approx. 30 minute long movie is an eye opening experiance.  The story is about the adventures of two kittys in the afterworld after death steals their souls.  The lead kitten, Nyaako, has a fever and her soul keeps wandering between life and death.  There is no spoken dialogue in the entire duration of the movie.  At times, some scenes make you wonder if you're hallucinating or not.  It is a rather deep and inciteful movie that everyone should go and see.  It's an experiance you'll never forget.  I can guarantee that.",1062288000,2,543,4.712765957446808

7996609,5,B0000ACP44,"One of the weirdest anime I have ever seen, both a voyage of self-discovery of a surreal bizarre world where you might cannibalizing your shipmate in a stranded boat or perhaps you end up chopping up some weirdo morbidly obese kidnapper with a fancy for spikey S&M esque black speedos, this is a violent anime with body parts flying, things destroying and just a plain treat of weirdness with a loose plot of the boy kitten trying to locate the missing soul of his sister before she dies.

Beautifully animated albeit short, the dvd is good. I feel glad I purchased it for so cheap in a used dvd store in Los Angeles.",1482019200,,617,4.460176991150442

7996611,5,B0000ACP44,"Oh dear this movie is one heck of a ride, let me just start off by saying that.

As other reviewers have stated (nearly all of them have, actually) this is basically one of the craziest movies youll be in the good fortune to witness. Even if cartoons aren't your thing, this plot in itself will keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering what crazy stuff will be happening next.

If you are a parent and think this movie (given it is animated) will be good for your young child you might want to watch it first. The overall theme of this movie is almost borderline excessively dark, and while the cute art style might ease you at the beginning, as the world changes around these two little cats, the undertones become in your face images that made me cringe, even as an adult in my early twenties. This movie is best suited for young adults and up, if I had to choose but everyone is different, so Ill let you decide whats best for your family.

Moving on, we start off this charming story with a pretty normal looking family with a normal seeming life  and then within about ten minutes, you're already cocking your head to the side in utter bafflement. As it continues, like stated above, it gets progressively more dark, and there are some very 18+ images shown more than once or twice. Death, abuse, violence, and real world problems seem to be at the center of everything, which is very interesting considering this movie is crammed packed full of symbolism and double meanings. Everything means something, unless it means nothing and even then, it meaning nothing means something. Basically, the roundabout explanation is that this movie should get you thinking about any number of things.

Overall, besides the creepy ending credits, this movie is a must see - 5/5 rating for a reason. If you have about 35 minutes to spare, and feel like creeping into some crazy world of deep thought or just want to go along for some crazy ride, this is the movie for you!",1424908800,2,1967,4.529577464788733
7996612,5,B0000ACP44,"Best anime I have seen in a while but this is not coming from an anime connoisseur.  Nonetheless, I found the subject matter to be very deep and thought provoking so much so that I saw the film 4 times in a row.",1328659200,,211,3.9069767441860463
7996613,4,B0000ACP44,"This is one of those movies where ""you'll never guess what happens next"".

The animation is nothing amazing, but flows smoothly and is still amazing in what this movie shows you. The symbolism is everywhere and quite beautiful.

The box says its ""hello kitty on acid"" and its right. Mushrooms aren't that intense or random and salvia doesn't last as long as this movie does. It is a trip. A movie that I have seen none other like it. Even the credits at the end are designed to mess with your head.

The movie is not fast paced but the scenery changes fast enough after the 1st 10 minutes that if you get bored, watch it for another minute and things will change. No dialoge. towards the end, they lay the symbolism on you pretty thick, but it's still beautiful.",1202774400,,762,4.428571428571429
7996614,5,B0000ACP44,"As said by the other reviews this is an extraordinary pieces of media that defys convention. Imagine Hello Kitty done by the director of Eraserhead only David Lynch was Japanese. This piece is just that. As other people have accurately surmised there is a story in this but the basic story hides other metaphorical meanings and plot. The basic story is about a pair of young sibling cats and the older sister is dying of an illness. The brother gets into an argument with death and gets into a tug of war that tears her soul in half saving her from death but not completely. Then he takes his sister to get the other half of her soul back. The animation is filled with very powerful symbology. Although many concepts in the portrayal are very Japanese there is not a single spoken word in any of this movie. It will help a lot if you are familiar with Japanese culture to understand some of the symbology like the little bell and the flower that reoccurres. Other symbols transcend cultural barriers.

NOT FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN AT ALL!!!!

Look, this animation goes in the class of Fantasia, Eraserhead, Alegro non Troppa (Bruno Bozzetti), and Liquid TV (the only really inspired show MTV ever did but now look what we are left with. Is there no humanity in entertainment any more?) but there is some really strange violence in this animation and it is so surreally done that it will leave you answering a horrendous number of questions. Also this movie, like the afore mentioned Fantasia, are way over young heads and they would never understand any of it. Also keep in mind that many of the images have DEEP cultural meanings and some will not be as clear as others. It is all part of the story. This is SO classic Japanese story telling if I ever seen it. One thing about Japanese people is that they have an indirect way of saying things that many Americans don't catch. They are a people of subtlty and intricasy. It is important to pay attention to this animation because if watched twice you will find things you missed before. There is more to this story about a brother trying to save his sister's life. There is a 'universal order'  story in this as well.

I was completely straight watching this but the other reviews calling Cat Soup 'Hello Kitty on Acid' were giving a good description of this movie. It is 34 minuets of great visuals and unusual sound and music. Do not come to this one with great expectations of Disney style animation. This is more like Hello Kitty done like Nausica to a Eraserhead like story of death and love. Now for those of the mind alternating persuasion, buy this, turn on, tune in, and drift away in a story that is told for the eyes and not the ears although the music and sound score that goes with this fit the scenes very well. This is a magic carpet ride into the surreal you are sure to enjoy. I got to say this is a must for any hard core animation and cinema collector. If you are into Japanese cinema (and I got a streak for it myself with a growing Akira Kurosawa collection (director of The Seven Samurai and Yojimbo) as well as Akira, Cowboy Bebop, Pom Poko and others in my collection) make sure this is one in your collection!!!!

If you do not appreciate Japanese cinema this might be over your head. If you like Eraserhead what are you waiting for if you have not seen this?!?! This is very surreal so be forewarned. Bad reviews on this one are usually by people who don't understand this genra of movie be it Japanese, British, Italian, or American and I can understand because taste is subjective and there is nothing wrong with not likeing a piece if there is real merit to one's dislikes. Don't let other reviews dissuade you from at least checking this one out and seeing if you like it. Cute never came off this wierd!",1175472000,7,3781,4.473913043478261
7996615,5,B0000ACP44,"This is pure genius.  It's dreamy, it's mind blowing, and it will make you cringe. I took mushrooms last night and my friend put this on.  The visual concepts have the most infinitely amazing implications.  And no matter what, you will always be surprised by what happens next.  The soft pop of tearing flesh and the screams of a balloon-bird being squeezed by wire; i highly recommend, to anyone who has got the balls, to try it out.",1174435200,,434,4.5256410256410255
7996616,5,B0000ACP44,"Man, they weren't kidding when they said this is hello kitty on acid.  It's about 40 minutes long, but it's definately a trip.  I DON'T like anime, but I love this one.",1168128000,,168,4.21875
