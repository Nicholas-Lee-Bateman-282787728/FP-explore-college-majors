6403944,2,B00K6R0EM6,"Well, I really wanted to like ol' Bat, but I guess I'm just not a fan. Here are most of the plots (SPOILER ALERT): Bat comes to town, some bad guy doesn't want him there, he meets a woman, kisses her, the bad guy tries to kill him, Bat hits him with a cane or shoots him, some unsolvable problem is solved by this, Bat kisses the woman again and then leaves town. Variations on this. If this was the wild west, it was kinda boring. And if the real Bat Masterson was as smug as Gene Barry it's a wonder he survived.",1443484800,3,514,4.0
6403945,5,B00K6R0EM6,Great tv show. I only bought it because Barry Atwater is in it.,1437609600,,63,3.923076923076923
6403946,3,B00K6R0EM6,"From 1958 to 1961, gene Barry starred as legendary lawman Bat Masterson. This box set contains all 107 half-hour episodes in glorious black and white. It's fun and totally mindless entertainment from the Sixties. At $12.00 for a complete series, what more could you want?",1435190400,,271,5.044444444444444
6403947,5,B00K6R0EM6,"I've seen all the Bat Masterson episodes over my lifetime, and it is nice to see these on DVD now. Even nostalgia METV and others are putting these on the airwaves now. I love watching all the old actors I grew up with in the 50s-70s. Gene Barry was a close second to James Garner for the coolest western character ever. Don't forget Palladin, he was pretty suave too.

I paid the extra couple of bucks to get the remastered Masterson. I was really going to get the super set of 60 episodes but figured I would end up buying them all eventually. These are classics. I don't know if this show would appeal to anyone outside my age bracket. Gene Barry puts on a good show, has the best looking women of that day, and a decent little plot to get you in and out quick with a half hour fast story. I love IMDB'ing the characters that usually get paraded through these dated oaters. Most of them have passed away now, or are living out there remaining days at the actors home in Woodland Hills. I guess they didn't make the kind of money that is tossed around Hollywood today with not even the nice residual bonuses either. They are surely not getting a nickel from these sets. Try it out, you'll love it.",1426032000,4,1199,4.3053097345132745

8656415,2,B00K6R0EM6,"CAVEAT EMPTOR!  (Let the buyer beware particularly if you have a Blu-Ray DVD player) The TWO stars isn't for the series, which I'd give a FIVE. I LOVED Bat Masterson as a kid, came up teething on these westerns and my favorites were Bat, Paladin, (Have Gun Will Travel) and the ""Old Ranger"" with Death Valley Days. So contrary to what you might think, I'm not criticizing the Series--it's terrific, especially to those of us old enough to remember it. (The first full novel I ever read was ""Bat Masterson"" and I STILL have it! (see photo of cover -- Got it in second grade, 1956-7). Now to the issue: These DVD-R discs frequently freeze in some Blu-Ray players.  I have what I thought was a quality VIZIO Blu-Ray DVD player... and until I tried playing a set of DVD-R recorded Masterson episodes... everything was going swimmingly. But THESE... from the Double Showdown (first episode) froze more than a dozen times and could NEVER get to watch the entire episode... fortunately I have a plain-ol DVD player in another room that plays them just fine--but I wish they'd have put it on a medium that played well on ALL players and not just some.  If yours isn't a Blu-Ray, or maybe if you're luckier than I was and it will play for you--more power to ya-- you'll LOVE the series (If like me you loved classic westerns). But sadly, I have to relegate Bat to another room until I can get another player for the front TV.",1503705600,,1416,4.501945525291829
8656416,3,B00K6R0EM6,"Well this was interesting.  Not historically correct but interesting.  The Digital Re-mastering was done quite well. The episodes are clear and sharp and the sound remains consistent.

(I gave this three stars as I have issues with the credibility.  The first episode is based on history and implies that all the rest are as well)

Bat Masterson became more widely known as a gunfighter as a result of a practical joke played on a gullible newspaper reporter in August 1881. Seeking copy in Gunnison, Colorado, the reporter asked Dr. W.S. Cockrell about man killers. Dr. Cockrell pointed to a young man nearby and said it was Bat and that he had killed 26 men. Cockrell then regaled the reporter with several lurid tales about Bat's exploits and the reporter wrote them up for the New York Sun. The story was then widely reprinted in papers all over the country.

Bat Masterson only killed three men, although he lived a colorful life.",1487462400,,1626,4.890909090909091
