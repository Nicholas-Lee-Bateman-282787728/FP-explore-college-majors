772727,4,6304084145,"This movie had the misfortune of being released shortly after Dr. Zhivago, and suffered from poor PR and the overwhelming public love affair with Julie Christie. In fact, this is a far better story than Dr. Zhivago, mostly because it is arguably the true story of the murder suicide of crown prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress, the baroness Maria Vetsera. Omar Sharif is his usual suave self as the crown prince, although a little unconvincing, but the underated and beautiful Catherine Deneuve produces a sympathetic performance as his mistress. the music (particularly the use of the ballet 'spartacus') is stunningly effective.",1203379200,5,637,5.194174757281553

772731,1,6304084145,"In early 1889, Crown Prince Rudolph, son of Emperor Franz Joseph and heir to the Hapsburg Empire, took his teenage mistress, Baroness Maria Vetsera, to a hunting lodge called ""Mayerling.""  What happened there has been the subject of a good deal of speculation, but the most popular version is this:  That sometime in the early morning hours of January 30th, Rudolph killed Maria with a single shot from his revolver, and then, some hours later, took his own life.  How they came to this moment in time is the subject of the film, ""Mayerling"" which stars Omar Sharif as Rudolph and Catherine Deneuve as Maria.
The film is highly sympathetic to the lovers, portraying them as kindred souls beset by the prejudices and stupidities of everyone around them.  Rudolph's liberal political views and Maria's innocence are made much of, and the idea that they were driven to the desperation of a suicide pact is central to the persuasiveness of this film.  Unfortunately I have a hard time buying any of it, and perhaps it's partly because I know too much about the real couple and their situation, but I think it's also because the film is so heavy-handed that we feel more bludgeoned than persuaded.  Sharif is wooden as Rudolph, but in all fairness some of the lines he's asked to deliver are almost laughable.  The Oedipal subtext between Rudolph and his mother, Elizabeth, has no real purpose beyond titillation, and it is frankly difficult to believe in Deneuve as ing&eacute;nue.  Had all the roles been written with more authenticity the story might well have worked as a tragedy, but Terence Young, who apparently drew on the novels of Claude Anet and Michel Arnold to write the screenplay, has taken the easy route here, complete with cardboard villains and people's heroes.  Not even James Mason as Franz Joseph or the ravishing Ava Gardner as Empress Elizabeth can propel this particular film out of the category of Bad Romance.
The look of the film owes more to the era in which it was made than that which it seeks to portray.  Makeup, hairstyles, even costumes reflect a sixties sensibility which may have put audiences at ease in 1968, but which are jarring today.  Frankly, this is one of the things that can really turn me off of a film; I tolerate it in ""Doctor Zhivago,"" but in ""Mayerling"" it becomes so distracting, that any credibility this film might have had for me goes right out the window whenever I see an actress with overdone, sixties-style eyeliner or lots and lots of hair woven into intricate, sixties-inspired dos.  I suggest you give this one a miss unless you're in the mood for some schmaltz.",978566400,22,2620,4.772123893805309
772732,5,6304084145,"A perfect example of Omar Sharif's brilliant acting, I wish we could see  him again in big US produced movies to use his rare talent in new movies  instead of losing him again to the Egyptian movie producers.

772995,3,6304084145,"This somewhat overheated film is a remake of a 1936 French film of the same title, with Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux in the lead roles as Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria and his teenaged mistress, Baroness Marie Vetsera.  Both films depend on a great deal of theorizing and guesswork about what is usually described as a murder-suicide in the imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling outside Vienna---with Rudolph shooting his young mistress first, and then himself.

To this day, we still don't know, and probably never will know, exactly what led to this murky scandal and its aftermath, with half of Vienna trying to come up with ways to conceal the fact that the Emperor's son and heir had blown out his brains.  The pre-1918 view was that Rudolph was genuinely in love with Marie, 17 years old to his 30, and their deaths resulted from a suicide pact tied to thwarted love.  True, Rudolph had sought permission to divorce his unsympathetic wife, Stephanie of Belgium, ostensibly to marry Marie, but we must doubt whether, after only 3 months' acquaintance, a short, dumpy, dark-haired 17-year-old could have inspired such feelings in a 30-year-old.  Most accounts today agree that he was not Marie's first lover, and that she may well have set her cap for him, but recent historians have sought other reasons for the scandal.  It has been suggested that Rudolph was flirting with opponents to Austrian rule in Hungary, who may have offered him the Hungarian throne in preference to his father, Emperor Franz Josef.  It is also theorized that Rudolph had been in unauthorized contact with French politicians who, if they won an imminent election, held out the promise of a Franco-Austrian alliance that just might have stopped World War I had it been in place in 1914.  Supposedly the collapse of the Hungarian offer and the electoral defeat of Rudolph's prospective French allies, on 2 successive days late in January 1889, left him politically isolated in Vienna and even vulnerable to charges of treason, which he felt left him with no alternative to suicide, which he committed at the end of January 1889.  (But surely if that were the case, he would not have needed to kill Marie, who could have had no part in such intrigues.)

While production values are high as regards sets, costumes and photography, the writing and acting in this film are massivley disappointing.  Omar Sharif does a much better job proving he could handle historical romance in ""Dr Zhivago,"" and Catherine Deneuve surprisingly comes off as a cipher, colorless and seemingly lacking any reason for getting involved with the prince.  (In any case, tall, blonde and beautiful, she bears no resemblance to the real Marie Vetsera, and I can only suppose that a woman of Deneuve's beauty was cast to give some credibility to their love affair. As heir to the throne, Rudolph had his pick of the most beautiful women in Vienna, and his supposed infatuation with the teenaged Marie still defies comprehension.)  Ava Gardner's beauty, still dazzling in 1968, seems to be her sole qualification for portraying Rudolph's mother the ill-fated Empress Elisabeth, and as Franz Josef, James Mason does little more than mutter dialogue that predictably showcases him as a remote, reactionary ruler deeply critical of his son.  These are puppets, not people.

In short, this film does nothing to clarify, let alone elucidate, the background to what amounts today to no more than a minor dynastic scandal in a vanished empire.  ""The Crown Prince"" (2010) tries again, but ends up jamming too much material into the story and, in its own way, confuses matters just as much as does ""Mayerling.""  It should be remarked that the tale of Rudolph and Marie has also inspired a ballet and an opera.  That much dramatizing should tell us something:  the story is essentially a clothes peg on which too many garments have been hung, one after the other.  None of them fits.",1374451200,3,3930,4.9167927382753405
772996,5,6304084145,"I had seen this movie several years ago  and enjoyed it immensely then, too.  Our Book Club watched it
this time.  No one had any negative comments whatsoever.  We liked the choice of actors for the
roles, the setting (scenes), the costumes, and the musical score.  Sexual content was not, and did
not have to be explicit, which should still be held as a standard in today's productions.  Anyone
who is interested in history should enjoy and appreciate this movie.  One couple borrowed the VHS
and after viewing re-read some of their works of history in regard to the Hapsburgs.  They found the
movie to be very true in its portrayal of that family and the era in which they lived",1363392000,6,680,4.56198347107438

772998,2,6304084145,"I just was able to view ""Mayerling"" recently (2010) on the wonderful TCM channel with rather mixed
emotions. The star cast most certainly good actors with some exceptions,but for this movie horribly
miscast. The hyped great ""Love story"" didn't exist,certainly on Rudolf's side,for him it was just
another ""fling"".Marie Vetsera was a TEENAGER (not an obvious older woman)when she met Rudolf and
soon found herself pregnant by him. Countess Larisch,herself a former mistress of R.helped her to
get an abortion- which in those days was a risky endeavor in any case. The abortion was botched but
the couple was not aware what would be in store for both of them. To ""recuperate"" Marie and R.had
themselves driven to the estate of Mayerling,where after approximately a day or so,Marie literally
bled to death---Rudolf must have been in absolute terror and turmoil with no way out-finally he
decided to take his own life. After the couple were discovered the Hapsburg elite and Secret Police
(yes,Virginia-even in those days Austria had them)decided to cover up this,to them,cataclysmic event
It would take too long to write what happended to the body of this poor girl--but from that time on
our fairy tale story was born----Rudolf ""shot"" first Marie and then himself because he thought
that they never would be allowed to marry. Ha!!!Of course to this day not a word of any pregnancy-
or the truth of what really happened at Mayerling. It makes one wonder---------",1290816000,,1459,5.033057851239669

773002,3,6304084145,"I saw the 1968 version of Mayerling in April of 1969 at a base theater
while I was in basic training in the Air Force.  I note this because the
subject of the film and its well-dressed actors and its European scenery
were so different from the military surroundings and military ""dress""
which I was enduring at the time.  I had not heard about the story of
Prince Rudolph and Princess Maria before. But suspected Mayerling's tragic ending from the start, but I think it did take the film a long time to reach its conclusion. However, I believe Mayerling was a visual delight and the musical score was beautiful too.
The cast was excellent with Omar Sharif and Catherine Deneuve along with
Ava Gardner and James Mason.  To many the story of these tragic lovers
seemed unbelievable and some criticized the dresses the women wore as too
1960's in style.  I did not notice this.
