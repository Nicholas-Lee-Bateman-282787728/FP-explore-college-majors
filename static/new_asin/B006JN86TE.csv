8499641,5,B006JN86TE,"Anything about Btaan, the Philippines and POWs of the Japanese. They all contribute to my family history project.
My dad was with the 803rd Engineering Aviation Battalion(EAB) at Clark Field. Became a POW of the Japanese after the 9 April 1942 surrender",1462579200,,253,5.0476190476190474
8499642,4,B006JN86TE,Good but too short.  There was so much more that should have been told.,1461542400,,71,4.071428571428571
8499643,1,B006JN86TE,"Very short.  It feels like they finish introducing the show, then it stops.  You can get more information by reading the Wikipedia page.",1448841600,,136,4.869565217391305
8499644,4,B006JN86TE,Tough to watch.  My brother in law was there.  Feel his pain and closer to him who is now in heaven.,1420934400,,100,3.7142857142857144
8499645,1,B006JN86TE,This DVD was heavily edited from the full version that was shown at the local PBS station KUNM sponsored presentation at the Kemo theater here in Albuquerque to honor those survivors of the Fall of Bataan. A total rip off.,1396051200,,222,4.575
8499646,4,B006JN86TE,DVD is a must watch for those of us with relatives who survived or died in this atrocity.  So glad they got interviews with so many who were 'there'.  My relative didn't talk about his experience so family has to learn from these movies.  Awful 3-1/2 years for Bataan and for the USA.,1393372800,,284,4.320754716981132
8499647,4,B006JN86TE,"This is an excellent documentary on the American and Philippine defenders who resisted the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in World war II.  Tragically ... shamefully, for months they fought heroically without reinforcements or supplies due to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ""Europe First"" policy.  He even ordered General Douglas MacArthur to escape to Australia while Major General Edward P. King ""surrendered"" the 75,000 Americans to the Japanese.  It's after this surrender that the heart wrenching ""Death March"" took place.  The sacrifice and suffering these men endured is told in bold detail through film footage and first-person accounts from fifteen survivors.  This DVD is a ""must have"" for any WWII history buff.  I rated it 4 stars only because it should have been an hour long instead of 30 minutes.  Today it seems everyone in the armed services is called a ""hero.""  This film introduces you to real Heroes in every sense of the word.",1353715200,7,956,5.162337662337662
8499648,4,B006JN86TE,"Good DVD with brief interspersed comments from a number of the Bataan Death March survivors.  Excellent film footage of the March from both the U.S. and Japanese which I have not seen before.  My dad was at Bataan and I found it very interesting, and suggest other's who had family members go through this ordeal to get a copy - especially for the grandchildren to see what their grandparents went through to give all of us the lifestyle's we enjoy today.",1328572800,8,455,4.604938271604938
