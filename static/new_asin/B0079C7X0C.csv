8631079,1,B0079C7X0C,"I was so into this series until about season 3. It degraded after Jason Turner died, but Tanya did ok on her own. After they got rid of her, it was pointless. This season was so bad, they brought Joan Collins in for 1-2 scenes, and then put her on the dvd cover.  They had literally all new characters, but then bring Tanya back to try to save this crap. Do not waste your time or money!",1357603200,3,387,4.025974025974026
