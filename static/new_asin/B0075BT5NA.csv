8510498,5,B0075BT5NA,"I waited a very long time for an Enrique concert DVD, and the kicker is - this was available for over a year before I learned of its existence! So the marketing's not too good where Enrique's concerned but the product itself is great!

Filmed in Belfast, this disc brings us all the joys of Enrique in concert. He brings a couple on stage to sing Somebody's Me to them, he brings one special woman on stage to sing Hero to, and he creates a comfortable, playful tone as he sings La Chica de Ayer on a couch. He swaggers, he struts, he glides, at one point he nearly flies! He seems as at home on the stage as he would be in his own living room.

The Insomniac album is a personal favorite, and it's well-represented here. He opens with the haunting Ring My Bells, and later gives us Tired of Being Sorry, Do You Know and the more aggressively sexy Push, along with a good sampling of his hits (Escape, Rhythm Divine, Bailamos, Be With You and Don't Turn Out the Lights). His personality fills the arena in this exciting concert. The only complaint I have is that, at just about an hour, it's far too short.",1382486400,5,1106,4.287081339712919
