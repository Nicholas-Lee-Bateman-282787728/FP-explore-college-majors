8126525,1,B000FTJ2XC,I received the wrong video and am returning it :( .,1522713600,,51,3.727272727272727
8126526,4,B000FTJ2XC,"The video itself is not bad at all nor is the instruction. But I had to subtract a star because there are no sections just on learning the movements so you can follow along. If this is ever re-released, I would recommend having one dvd in the set just on the different movements so a beginner like myself can see it done more slowly and get the form down before getting into the workout. Otherwise, great set, love the instructors :)",1490918400,,433,4.3580246913580245

the part reviewed is a pretty good
workout.",1275696000,,79,4.0
8126528,3,B000FTJ2XC,"First things first, some reviewers mention background being annoying.  I must add that I don't really care what is behind the instructor; I just want comprehensive programs.  Please read a different review if you care about background.

I purchased the floorwork and abs dvd's years ago.  I loved them at the time, but they were my first introduction to belly dance dvd's.  With that being said, I have had more exposure to belly dance and even purchased the other 2 dvd's in this set (buns & total/upper).

The buns one is interesting because most of the things mentioned on here should have been mentioned in all of the other dvds (for example: what muscle to contract), so there isn't any consistency.  However, the dvd is all right.  The moves are nothing too difficult and they're fun.

The total body one, which I guess is called upper body when sold alone, is dreadful.  It is rushed, and it is just really bad.  The moves are not good and neither is the instructor.

Again, I loved the abs & floorwork, but that was before I had seen any other belly dance productions.  I would NOT purchase the 4 pack.  If you have taken classes a few times or know how to properly perform an undulation (through books or whatever); then I would purchase the abs one for sure and maybe the buns one (both are led by Neon).  I don't want to sound mean and compare people but I need to be honest here.  Unfortunately, Tanna's delivery is boring and non-motivating. Neon has so much more life and better execution of movements so you can clearly see what you are ""supposed"" to be doing.",1259625600,,1575,4.531914893617022
8126529,2,B000FTJ2XC,"Total Body: The tutorial section is very hurried but effective; I really like the text or diagrams at the lower left that display the movement's name or a figure with arrows to indicate the movement.  This is not something for beginners to use to learn moves, though!  The inclusion of props is nice, if just as hurried, and the music in this section is also unfortunate, but fairly easily ignored.  The indicator at the lower left continues into the sessions, where there's also a counter for the number of movements completed.  Less fortunate, Tanna doesn't cue consistently and the changing camera angles are sometimes disorienting.  The sessions move quickly enough to work up a sweat, but also so quickly that beginners will find this extremely difficult to follow.  The dance segments are nice to watch but lack any explanation of the choreography, rather a baffling thing.  The included performance is well-danced but for some reason placed against a CG backdrop, which makes the whole affair look tacky.

Buns & Thighs: This disc has some major technical issues for me; the menu... disappears, so I'm stuck clicking on things and hoping I get what I'm looking for.  For some inexplicable reason, the backgrounds have been stripped out here, leaving Neon dancing in front a black nothingness.  This bothers me so much (along with the occasional appearances of the trainer) that I can never make it more than a few minutes into the disc.

Floorwork: This disc has the same technical issues as the Buns & Thighs video, with the missing menus.  Fortunately, there's bullets to give me hints as to the menu option locations on this one, though I still have no idea what I'm going for.  The diagrams are back (and a welcome change from the little swirls on Neon's backside), but Tanna's cueing is still only mediocre, giving only general guides.  The camera work is worse, though, switching between odd angles with the occasional distractingly-abstract transition and, most of the time, very shaky.  Very few of the moves on this disc seem to be bellydance-related, but it's nonetheless an effective, fairly-difficult workout.

Abs: This is another disc with menu problems, although it at least shows up this time; it was just done quite unwisely with black text on a black background with only a narrow yellow glow to set the menu options apart.  This is also another disc where the background's been stripped out, so Neon's dancing once again against nothing.  It's honestly disconcerting.  This time, the display features a front shot of Neon and a back shot of Neon on the same screen.  They're often just out of sync and frequently overlap, making it hard to follow either one.  This is another disc I just couldn't make it more than a few minutes into.

Overall: As much as I like the total body disc (despite its hurried pace), the other three are dealbreakers for me.  The production values are just very poor and, for a series, there's absolutely no consistency in formatting or presentation.  I really just can't recommend this to anyone, especially not for its price.",1223769600,5,3080,4.890173410404624
8126530,5,B000FTJ2XC,"This 4 disc set is wonderfully varied, and will help get you in shape while having lots of fun. If you're the type that gets bored with the average exercise routine, these DVDs will keep you interested while the expert teachers instruct you in the art of bellydancing, and give you some low impact movements to shape and firm your body.

The attractive instructors are Neon, Tanna Valentine, and Andy Troy. Neon dances and teaches on 2 discs, Tanna on the other 2. Andy begins each disc with ""About This Program"" explaining how each muscle group works with diagrams, and he has tremendous knowledge in this area. Neon's sessions include Andy's ""Pop-ups"" with advice on how to do the movements safely and get the best results. All DVDs have 3 dance programs and include a warm-up and a cool-down. Music is by Jehan, Geoff Groberg, and others.

Neon does the ""Buns and Thighs"" and the ""Abs"" sessions. Neon's technique is superb, and she's a joy to watch and learn from. She also has spectacular ""abs"" while still remaining curvy and feminine, and though few of us will ever achieve her sculpted looks, we can still do our best to improve on what we've got, at whatever our starting point is. Neon's programs have her movements ""floating"" against a black background, and are occasionally seen from both front and back views.

Tanna does the ""Floorwork"" and the ""Upper Body"" sessions. These are filmed in a lovely super large studio, and also include a tutorial, and a performance, with costumes and sets. For the floorwork you will need a large mat, or a thick rug to work on. Those with problematic knees will have to use discernment on some movements so as not to cause stress (on the full laybacks for instance). For the ""Upper Body"" dances you will need a veil for the 2nd dance. Veils were made popular in the New York cabaret scene of the 60's, and Tanna recommends getting 3 yards of polyester chiffon. For the 3rd dance you will need a light dance cane (or a dowel cut to size). This dance with a cane is an authentic folkloric Egyptian number and is my absolute favorite dance on the entire DVD set.

You don't have to have to have a lot of dancing experience to do well in many of these lessons (some are harder, but you can work at your own level). The steps are fairly simple and explained well, and instead of doing the ""same old same old"" exercises, you'll be bellydancing!",1222646400,7,2384,4.576112412177986
8126531,4,B000FTJ2XC,"This four-DVD set is the same as the ""Belly Dance for Body Shaping"" series, only all four in one case. The 15-minute workouts (3 on each DVD) are all broken down into component excercises, but are not all easy (great for several different skill levels). The floorwork is the most difficult, especially for people with bad knees or who have difficulty doing back-bends, etc. I like the variation of techniques, too (cane, veil, abs, floorwork, whole body, etc.) The ""commentary guy"" is a little scary, at times, but he does give good tips. The illustrations are at times a little difficult to interpret, but after I figured out what they were doing it helped a lot. The counter that tells you how many reps is my favorite features. I would recommend this set to people who want to work on technique but not necesarily want a ""workout"" DVD.",1163289600,15,838,4.668918918918919
