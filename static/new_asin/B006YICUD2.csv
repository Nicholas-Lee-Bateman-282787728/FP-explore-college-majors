8506481,5,B006YICUD2,"Surprisingly, the picture was great.  I wasn't sure if this was a boot-leg dvd at first before I ordered it, but seems like a legit item now that I have it.  But then again, I am no expert.  As for the movie, I was entertained but was hoping for more gruesome make-up and action scenes.  Lovie Poe was good in this movie.  But I didn't like how it ended.",1358208000,2,354,4.072463768115942
