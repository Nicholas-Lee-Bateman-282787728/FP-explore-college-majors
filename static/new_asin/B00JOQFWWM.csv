8652638,3,B00JOQFWWM,"There are 3 interesting fights in this show but they ended very soon. The main card fight was lopsided.

Tim Botch vs Luke Rock hold
Its the second best fight of this show. Its exciting.  It ended in round 1. Luke, with his feet, had a choke hold on Tims head and left arm (Kimura Lock). At the same time Luke had, with his 2 hands had another lock on Tim right arm.

Anthony Johnson vs Phil Davis
Its the best fight of this show. Both men attacked continuously in round 1. Phil tried to take down Anthony multiple times but he failed. Anthony was too strong. Phil bled a lot in this round from a cut near his left eye. It ended in round 3. There was no surprise here.

Castillio vs Brenneman
Both fighters were skillful. Both attacked from the beginning till the end. Their wrestling techniques were very good. They counter wrestled each other many times. It ended unexpected in round 2 with a knockout.

Max Holloway vs Andre Fili
Its interesting and fast paced. It ended in round 2 with a choke hold. Both fighters landed many strikes.

Yancy Medeiros vs Jim Miller

It ended in round 1 with a choke hold. It ended too quickly to be interesting.

Glover Texeira vs Jon Jones
Its very interesting in the first two rounds. Glover landed many strikes but they did not deliver any serious damage to Jon. His longer reach and effective kicks hurt Glover. Its disheartening to see Jon put one of his hands on Glovers forehead to keep him far away and Glover could not do anything about it. Its like a childs play.  In round 3, Glover bled profusely from a large cut in his right eyebrow. Its obvious that Glover did not have any chance to win.",1432684800,,1640,4.368421052631579

8652642,4,B00JOQFWWM,"UFC 172 was headlined by Jon Jones who was putting his belt on the line against challenger Glover Teixeira. Jones is arguably the best pound for pound fighter in the world. He has dismantled all opponents set in front of him aside from his close decision win over Alexander Gustafsson. Coming into this fight Glover Teixeira has an impressive 22-2 record and has been undefeated for nearly 9 years. So maybe Teixeira is the man to take the championship belt from Jones who looks to set the record for consecutive LHW title defenses. The co-main event features top ranked LHW Phil Davis taking on Anthony Johnson who is making his return to the octagon. Phil Davis is heavily favored to win and with a win could possibly spell a title shot for him. The third fight on the main card features Tim Boetsch taking on Luke Rockhold with a win for either pushing them towards the top of the middleweight rankings. Also on the main card is the always exciting Jim Miller fighting against Yancy Medeiros.

Main event for the light heavyweight championship:
Jon Jones (winner by decision) vs Glover Teixeira

On the main card Max Holloway quickly finished Andre Fili with Guillotine choke. The following fight ended almost exactly as the Hollway fight with Jim Miller submitting Yancy Medeiros also with a Guillotine. The next fight featured Tim Boetsch fighting Luke Rockhold. Rockhold quickly took him down and finished him in the first round with a triangle choke. The co-main event was a big fight for Phil Davis with a title shot possibly on the line with a dominant performance. Maybe Davis took Anthony Johnson lightly and was too focused on trash talking Jon Jones leading up to this fight. But Davis looked extremely flat, couldn't land a takedown and didn't look to be on Johnson's level with wrestling or striking. Johnson stuffed every takedown attempt usually clipping Davis with an uppercut which caused Davis to hesitate for the rest of the fight. Johnson won a lopsided 30-27 decision. Now onto the main event of the fight card, the LHW champion Jon Jones vs Glover Teixeira. Coming into this fight Teixeira was a heavy underdog and most expected Jones to dominate him using his length and reach advantage to keep Texixeira at bay. Although Jones did thoroughly dominate Teixeira the entire fight he fought him up close and where everyone thought Glover would want the fight. After round one Jones had injured Teixeira's shoulder with a standing arm crank and from that point on Jones just beat him up for the remainder of the fight winning handily 50-45.

I gave this card a 4/5 star rating because there's plenty of finishes throughout the entire card. A big upset with Anthony Johnson stuffing all of Phil Davis's takedowns and beating him up for three rounds. And as most expected a one sided beating for Glover Teixiera although the way Jones did it wasn't expected. This was an overall great card with lots of finishes and definitely worth the watch.",1401580800,4,3575,4.871710526315789
