153739,5,0792841980,"""Coffy"" (1973) made Pam Grier a star, ""Foxy Brown"" (1974) clearly shows why Grier became a star.  ""Foxy Brown"" simply distills Grier's star qualities and uses them to their fullest potential, and by star qualities, I'm not just referring to her ample bosom.  In ""Foxy Brown"" Grier is an abused, violated madwoman out for revenge at all costs, she doesn't just chew up the scenery, she obliterates it.  But that's exactly why we love Grier.  She's beautiful, sultry and she can kick a whole lotta ass!  As far as I'm concerned, she IS the screen's original action heroine and this vehicle best showcases her talents as an action star.  Unlike ""Coffy,"" ""Foxy Brown"" doesn't give Grier much chance to flex her acting muscles, but it features Grier down and dirty: Foxy ransacks apartments, beats up hostile lesbians, gouges eyes, burns men alive, emasculates (literally and figuratively), and even pulls firearms out of her perfectly coifed afro.  ""Foxy Brown"" is lurid, wildly sadistic, absolutely over-the-top and a cult film classic for those very reasons.  ""Coffy"" may be the better film, but ""Foxy Brown"" is more enjoyable.  So how does ""Foxy Brown"" fare on DVD?  Well, the disc is an absolute revelation.  Not since the film's theatrical debut has it looked this good.  The previous full-frame transfer used for the videocassette and laserdisc was atrocious, featuring jaundiced flesh tones, excessively saturated colors, dark murky interiors, ruined compositions, and horrifically over-enhanced edges.  The new, anamorphically-enhanced widescreen transfer is luminous.  Compositions are correctly preserved with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, no more distracting headroom and a bit of picture information is added to the sides.  The interiors now reveal wood paneling, earth-toned wallpaper and maroon curtains, unlike the previous transfer which rendered almost everything black or dark brown.  The flesh tones are finally natural and the film's colors are brought down to a comprehensible saturation level, but don't worry, the 70's fashions are still a bright kaleidoscope of tawdriness.  The sharpness is pleasing; edge-enhancement never rears its ugly head and the film's skies are at last blue.  Gone is the olive and yellow sunlight.  Film grain is noticeable in some dark scenes and there are a few source defects.  Considering this is a low-budget exploitation film made in 1974, the source element is almost pristine.  Compression on the disc is not so pristine, however.  Some dark, shadowy areas and dissolves are frequently subject to tiling artifacts, but for a retail price of only $14.95, who can complain?  Supplements include the amusing theatrical trailer (""Foxy's got guts: no ifs, ands, or buts!"") and an enlightening commentary track by director Jack Hill who repeatedly describes the toils of working with AIP (American International Pictures) on this film, which he has said was one of his worst film-making experiences.  The monaural sound on the disc is commendable; dialogue is always intelligible and the bass level makes Willie Hutch's score sound just as funky as it was 27 years ago.  Jack Hill created Pam Grier her own sub-genre with ""Coffy"" and ""Foxy Brown"" and when she left it after 1976's dismal ""Friday Foster,"" no one took her place...no one ever could.  ""Foxy Brown"" is the ultimate Pam Grier action vehicle, a blaxploitation classic and a great DVD!  If you have only seen ""Foxy Brown"" on videocassette or laserdisc, you haven't seen ""Foxy"" at all.",995673600,35,3489,5.2284172661870505
153740,4,0792841980,"Great DVD. Beautiful, widescreen picture and a fun story. You don't measure a movie like this by ""Citizen Kane"" standards; you measure it by Joe Bob drive-in standards; and by that measure, ""Foxy Brown"" makes the grade. You get Foxy bullwhipped around the neck and dragged; you get the riot scene in the ... bar; you get the judge humiliated by call girls before the ladies auxiliary; you get Foxy shooting her two-timing, dope-selling brother in the ear. Oh, it gets better, but you'll have to see the movie to find out how.",993945600,,525,4.655913978494624
153741,4,0792841980,"Pam looks awesome in this flick, but there is more nudity in Coffey. This flick has great scenes, like how she escapes from the 'ranch'. Watching her tongue stretch to the max to pick up the razor blade is enough to make me want to watch this film twice. Like in Coffey she has to play a call girl to get 'in'. However she looked better as 'Mystique' in Coffey than 'Silky Cotton' in Foxy Brown.
The 70's fashion and lingo is all here though. If you are a Pam Grier fan, this is a must. Rock solid and dynamite brother.",985564800,4,519,4.148514851485149
153742,2,0792841980,"Once again, a TERRIBLE DVD!! The movie is A CLASSIC, and like the 'Coffy' DVD, you don't get your money's worth. You DO get 'MONO SOUND' with this DVD, and I was hoping for a 'surround sound' experience when I bought this disc. If I were you, I would AVOID ALL OF THESE 'SOUL CINEMA' DVDS, because they don't give you a full 5.1 Digital transfer, or any 'DVD Bonus Features lke interviews, etc. Save your money, and either buy the VHS tape, or wait for better DVDS.I gave this DVD 2 stars just because Pam was involved, otherwise it would get 1 star!!!",983577600,6,552,4.3173076923076925
153743,5,0792841980,"I bought this DVD and listened to Jack Hill's Commentary Track (I've seen the movie MANY times). Hill's coments are very informative and on track. He talks about the history of Blaxploitation and also of working with Mantan Moreland on SPIDER BABY and mentions how much the civil rights movement hurt the careers of black actors like Moreland who made a career with the stereotypical roles that civil rights leaders declared ""demeaning""...very interesting stuff. Hill offers some good insight into Pam Grier (this was supposed to be a sequel to COFFY)... The DVD looks and sounds great. If anyone is not familiar with Blaxploitation films of teh 70's, this is the PERFECT place to start.",982627200,4,687,4.982608695652174
153744,4,0792841980,"The reviewer who thought this was a movie about a current singer either is pulling our leg or is dumber than a post. Just look at the cover. Probably, they are too young to recognize it as one of the classic blaxploitation movies of the 70s. Of course the acting is terrible, the dialogue lame and the plot is weak. They were supposed to be. After all, these movies were made on a production budget of $23.56. Any movie that provides a means of getting Pam Grier out of her clothes as often as possible is sufficient validation for anything. (In this regard, see Pam's 1973 Coffy).",980121600,15,581,4.4392523364485985
153745,4,0792841980,"Foxy Brown, the 'sequel' of Coffy, stars Pam Grier and delivers a forceful addition to the 'blaxploitation' genre.  Foxy is a fighter. Backed against the wall by a feared drug cartel, she comes out swinging with fierce vengence and the determination to rid the streets of scum.  A dual source of rage against the cartel unfolds: both her lover and then her brother are killed by them.  A woman scorned is an understatement.  Foxy is on a mission and the only resolve is either the cartel's demise or her own.  Foxy Brown proves to be a whirlwind of action that relentlessly churns throughout the film.  Director Jack Hill is an auteur of low-budget, eye-opening cinematography.  He knows how to write/direct with a sense of honesty and cleverly blends sympathy and vigilante empathy.  The print is gorgeous and well-rendered.  The soundtrack by Willie Hutch helps to enhance the journey.  The Hill commentary is priceless.  A must for anyone who is either interested in blaxploitaion or wants to find out where Tarantino found his inspiration for Jackie Brown.  Aside from the obvious nod found in the title, many of the cinematic techniques/plot developments clearly prove to be Tarantino's textbook of hard-hitting, ghetto realism.  Foxy Brown not only epitomizes the important cinematic contributions of blaxploitation films but also shows that a good film can be made without pandering to the mainstream.",979862400,5,1408,5.12280701754386
153746,4,0792841980,"Pam Grier is the ultimate woman of Blaxploitation.  Heck, she's just the queen of action period. In ""Foxy Brown"" she plays an average but super woman that refuses to let the drug dealers/pimps take over her town.  It basically leads to her brother being caught up in the drug scene and being a victim of it. This forces Pam as Foxy to make herself a prostitute the model like sex slavery ring the group has going on.  It's really a simple story and basically is meant to capture Pam in lots of action sequences (one even in a lesbian bar) and in stages of undress.  Mission accomplished.
The really disturbing part is that Foxy gets treated really badly.  I mean, really badly!  She gets used by everyone from gangsters to rednecks.  It's very disturbing and in comparison, Blaxploitation fave ""Shaft"" is light hearted.  This isn't enough for me to knock the movie down at all, but the fact that some of the characters are a little bit to eccentric is.  What is with the female head of the organization and the weird thing with her eyes?  This is a cool action movie, but not for the kids at all!",972345600,,1096,4.4623115577889445
153747,4,0792841980,"FOXY BROWN is a great movie, but not a great explotation movie.  Oddly enough this is the film that got Pam Gier the title ""QUEEN OF THE EXPLOTATION FLICKS"".  When I first sat down to watch this film I was  expecting to see tons of gratuitous nudity and violence.  The nudity in  this film was seldom and the violence was not very graphic.  Don't get me  wrong, I loved this film and it really is a classic 70's film, but don't go  in expecting the normal 70's gratuity.  The story is about a woman that  becomes a vigilante in order to get revenge for the death of her boyfriend.  The plot thickens when other elements are thrown into play like a drug  addict younger brother, an underground militant army, and a mother forced  into prostitution.  If you like this film, but you also really like  gratuitous nudity and violence; I would highly recommend watching COFFY.  Pam Grier is the star of that movie also, but the storyline is a little  more loose and there is nudity all over the place (including Grier).",947548800,22,1013,4.478021978021978
153748,5,0792841980,"If you are a fan of blaxploitation you know Pam Grier is the Queen. Director Jack Hill's sleazy vision was perfect for this genre, however, Pam Grier's talent shows through the sleazy campiness- which is one of the  film's biggest assets. Foxy Brown is obviously the inspiration for Jackie  Brown. If you like Tarantino you will like anything with Pam Grier- and  this is her best. Sid Haig is her brother in this film, he was the Judge in  Jackie Brown. This is the ultimate Blaxploitation/Action movie and an  instant classic.",946771200,,528,4.758241758241758

There's a dismemberment by airplane sequence that doesn't even attempt to look real. What's not to love? Mainly this special feature-less package!! There are zero special features. NONE!! Nothing whatsoever. This is 2016 and it is a Blu Ray. How on Earth this film managed to get released without a single special feature in the US blows my mind. Not even a trailer?!?! Don't get me wrong, I am pleased as punch to own this movie but I buy Blu Ray's because I want the whole kit and kaboodle. I want documentaries and trailers and commentary. I'd just watch freaking Netflix if I just wanted to watch a movie and move on with my life. Olive Films do Jack Hill, Pam Grier and film fans a great disservice by putting out such a lacklustre product when so many others like Scream Factory, Arrow Video, Criterion, Severin and others are putting out remarkable Blu Ray packages that are sometimes worth buying for the bonuses alone. Someone oughta school Olive Films on how you put out Blu Ray's in this day and age. Boo!!! I couldn't rate this less than 3 stars because I love this movie. But I couldn't rate this 5 stars because of how cheap Olive Films are. So right down the middle with three stars. Movie? Five stars. Olive Films? Zero stars.",1473206400,2,1390,4.54183266932271

This was the era a whack-a-da music, wide lapels, chrome bumpers, screeching tires, and loud carburetors. Pam gets in some good lines as a prostitute. Very politically incorrect language by today's standards.

153854,3,0792841980,"Having made a name for herself with the release of COFFY, Pam Grier went on to more action fare in the Blaxploitation genre. This time she starred in this film, a carry-over from the previous movie uniting her again with director/writer Jack Hill. It paid off once more with a movie that fans of the genre love.

This time around Grier plays the title character, a strong female woman who is doing her best to get her younger brother off of and away from drugs. At the same time her boyfriend, an undercover policeman, is recovering from plastic surgery done so he won't be recognized by the remnants of the gang he helped put away. Both plans fall flat when her brother passes along the new identity to drug lords Miss Katherine and Steve Elias. In short order Foxys beau is murdered and Foxy is set on a path of destruction and revenge.

The movie would make a fine double bill with her previous effort COFFY. Both have strong women who love the men they're involved with but don't need to have them in their lives to be strong characters. Both are set on a path for revenge against ruthless criminals out to reap profits from the sale of drugs to the masses. And both have family members or loved ones killed by the same drug lords who will then suffer for what theyve done.

Grier once more proves that she has the acting chops to take on a lead role and this film advanced her once more in not just the action genre but in displaying her dramatic abilities as well. Watching these films now one has to wonder just why she wasn't given more work or the chance to play stronger dramatic roles rather than just the action films she was in. Perhaps it was just pegging an actress into a category that she was successful in or maybe it was due to few lead roles being provided for black actresses at the time. The truth of the matter is that in ignoring her capabilities we were denied the chance to see her in more suitable roles until Quentin Tarantino gave her the chance with JACKIE BROWN (no connection to this film).

What is great to see is Olive Films coming through once again by providing another genre classic in blu-ray format that is perhaps the best quality edition of this film released to date. Fans of action films or the Blaxploitation genres now have the opportunity to add this to their collections to be watched over and over again. As I said earlier, on a double bill with their version of COFFY this would make a nice drive in evening at home, popcorn and soda in hand and action blowing off the screen.",1438300800,,2526,4.414163090128755

I Love Foxy Brown (there's always been this debate which is better Coffy or Foxy Brown?)
They are Both Great pieces of Film that were made with so much love and with that old american ""Fearless"" way of thinking
You could Never Ever make either film today.....
I just like F.B, a bit more.....
Pam Grier is such a great actress that really was type cast due to the blaxploitation craze of the 1970's
For any Female to take the roles she did in the 70's was insightful and ambitious

Anyone who loves Films who has never seen this go out of your way and check it out

It has a first play menu with two options (""play"" and ""chapters"") - seems odd they even bothered to put a menu on this.

After watching this I ordered the UK release put out by Arrow Video. That one is packed with extras (commentary, interviews, featurettes, etc), comes in a steelbook, and was cheaper! The booklet inside even had a higher quality print of the poster image than the US cover! Unfortunately the UK release is Region B, so you'd need a region-free player to watch it.

Quite honestly, none of those things really apply but its worth noting that those were the three things going through my mind when I sat down to watch this movie.  All that said, there was really one thing that Foxy Brown proved.

Cult classics don't always have to be good.

Yup, Foxy Brown is a pretty good example of a film that has a massive following and yet fails to be anything but trashy and exploitative and just plain badand yet a whole lot of fun at the same time.  Laced with pretty horrible acting and a plot that is so ridiculous that it bears repeating, but you cant help but want to watch every frame.  The costumes, music and set pieces are hilariously fun, and the script, while trashy and dumb, serves up some entertainment for sure, but at the end of the day I cant say I witnessed anything noteworthy.

153984,4,0792841980,"""Foxy Brown"", written and directed by Jack Hill in 1974, was supposed to be a sequel to 1973's ""Coffy"", which had made Pam Grier a star. But American International Pictures felt that it should be a stand-alone film, as sequels were not doing good box office at that time. As a result, the name of the protagonist became ""Foxy Brown"", which proved to be an iconic choice, but there is also a vagueness about Foxy's situation, because Jack Hill couldn't use the character details from ""Coffy"". Despite these problems and a very limited budget for supporting cast, ""Foxy Brown"" is probably the best-remembered of the ""blaxploitation"" genre with a female lead, and the name follows Pam Grier around to this day. It helped make her one of the few true female action stars in film history.

Foxy Brown (Pam Grier) has to rescue her brother Link (Antonio Fargas) when a couple of thugs come after him for money owed to a loan shark. Link has promised his sister that he quit dealing drugs, but now he's in deep with the same criminal syndicate over a gambling loan. Foxy's frustrated with Link but looking forward to her boyfriend being released from the hospital soon. He worked as an undercover federal agent trying to find evidence against a heroin wholesaler for two years. Now he has been given a new nose and a new name, Michael Anderson (Terry Carter). But when he is released into Foxy's waiting arms, Link recognizes him and thinks he can sell Michael out to the drug kingpin, Katherine Wall (Kathryn Loder), in exchange for a clean slate.

There is over-the-top behavior, over-the-top wardrobe, and a lot of star power from Pam Grier, without which this might not keep the audience's attention. Grier is an imposing physical presence, and she can get people rooting for her even under the most preposterous circumstances. ""Vigilante justice? It's as American and apple pie,"" says Foxy. Then she tries to convince us. There is sex, unabashedly gratuitous nudity of the topless variety, torture, mutilation, and a lesbian bar fight, among other improbable scenarios. And, thankfully, humor. It's all about spectacle... with an anti-drug message, though the good guys are about as nutty as the villains. ""Foxy Brown"" was a funky vehicle for Black American subculture, and it seems to be an attempt at crossover, as well.

The DVD (MGM 2001): There is an audio commentary by Jack Hill, which is fairly constant and informative. Some of it is scene-by-scene commentary, but Hill also talks a lot about the film's conception, changes and limitations that were imposed by the studio, his relationship with the talent in the film, themes, and his intentions. There is also a theatrical trailer (2 min). Subtitles are available in French and Spanish.",1347148800,3,2744,4.9094827586206895

Even the camerawork is good, the editing less disjointed than in some films of this era. And it's not without humor, either; the double entendres with the two hookers and the judge were LOL hilarious, plus the time Foxy hides a gun in her 'fro.

Grier holds her own against predominantly male leads in this genre--the pickle-jar emasculation of a tough guy here is notable, as is Foxy's rape by rednecks--thus making this essentially a sexploitation film, too. It must be said, however: Tarantino's homage is a much better film, and furthermore, the actress improved with age. So enjoy the best of both worlds and watch 'em as a double feature.

Well, that was a good move, because even thought some of the acting was atrocious, the girls all looked so good. I've had the DVD's of ""Black Mama, White Mama"", ""Coffy"", and ""Foxy Brown"", so now, more than ever, I want these films released as remastered Blu-Ray releases.

People who concentrate so hard on living for the moment, and only caring about the current movie releases of the day, are never going to see the art of sexy, saucy cinema that was so much more apparent in the seventies.

The fabulous, drop-dead gorgeous Pam Grier, played Foxy Brown with a seething conviction. After her man was gunned-down by drug-dealers, Foxy is out for blood. And she makes sure that the bad-guys shed their share, while she goes about the task of settling the score.

Pam Grier made Foxy's rage and obsession with revenge, seem palpable. Foxy did whatever she had to do, to make the villains pay. The viewer really gets caught-up in Foxy's quest for justice. You want to cheer, when Foxy gets even with those who did her wrong.

Pam Grier's stunning good looks, and her athletic grace, made her a perfect choice to play Foxy Brown. I can't imagine any other woman starring in this role. No other black female actress, was as compelling on-screen as Pam Grier was in the 70s.

The cool funkiness of 70s Blaxploitation cinema, is certainly in evidence in Foxy Brown. The outrageously tacky clothes, giant 'fros, jive-talking' characters, slick cars, sexy mamas, gun-totin' urban thugs-it's all here in this film.

154039,5,0792841980,"This was my first real experience with a so-called Blaxploitation movie and I have to say I was incredibly impressed.  A novice goes into this genre with several different expectations; e.g., a movie that is very degrading to blacks and women, has no positive message, and suffers from a lack of a sincere effort to provide good entertainment along with a quality production.  Thankfully, these were proven to be misconceptions and Foxy Brown is a movie to be ranked with the best films in the history of cinema.

The first thing that struck me about this movie is the strong female lead of Foxy Brown played by Pam Grier.  I had seen her in Tarantino's Jackie Brown and knew that his film was a nod to the Blaxploitation genre so I was expecting the same kind of vibe; however, I had a totally different experience and I believe Foxy Brown is easily the superior movie even though Grier's acting skills have improved over the years, as anybody's would.  But going into the movie I thought Foxy would use sex as more of a weapon than sexuality, which was another misconception on my part.  The sex scenes and limited nudity in this film were properly done and never seemed gratuitous.  It was great to watch a film where the female controlled the situation using her head instead of her genitalia.

The messages in this film were excellent: drugs are depicted as something to be avoided and can lead to the destruction of lives and families, law enforcement officers and authority figures can't always be trusted, and the best way to improve your life is to take action, albeit a little extreme in this case, but Foxy found herself in an extreme situation.  I would say the only scene in the movie that I thought was more than a little unfair was the scene in the lesbian bar.

The most gratifying thing about Foxy Brown, apart from the excellent score written by Willie Hutch, was the production.  It's immediately obvious that these were people working on a limited budget yet they tried very hard to provide a quality production.  Sure the acting is bad at times, the editing might not be perfect here and there, and the special effects were very basic, but on the whole you get a sense that the people involved with this film were trying to make the best movie they could and something that viewers would want to watch repeatedly and in that regard, at the very least, this film is a huge success.

Foxy Brown is an excellent contribution to cinema and should be placed among the best films that were considered to be the avante-garde at the time of their release.",1168819200,2,2568,4.605263157894737
154040,5,0792841980,"Blaxploitation movies often get a bad rap from chin-stroking types who judge them against standard cinematic masterpieces like Citizen Kane etc. That's the problem with consensus - films are judged by a single yardstick instead of on their individual merits. Blaxploitation is one such genre which has suffered from this approach and is one that needs to be appreciated on its own terms. By that measure, Foxy Brown is an outstanding success - super-iconic Pam Grier plays her characteristic tough-black chick dispensing rough justice to all manner of low-lifes. Solid '70s production values, tight narrative, never slow or lagging and at the same time, a sound portrait of where Black America was at psychically in 1974.

She utilizes her street smarts, her sexuality, weapons and the help of a neighborhood ""anti-slavery"" committee to acomplish her mission.

An indictment of a high level crime syndicate falls through, resulting in the change of narcotics agent Dalton Ford's (Foxy's love interest) identity to Michael Anderson to protect him from possible retaliation of the syndicate. Foxy's brother Link (Antonio Fargas), who runs numbers and sells drugs for the syndicate, discovers Michael's real identity and reveals it to his employers to get out of a $20,000 debt. To ensure that Michael/Dalton Ford ""never opens his mouth again in court"", the syndicate murders him in cold blood and he dies in Foxy's arms.

This is where the action begins.

Foxy seeks revenge on Link first for pointing the finger on her man and forces him to give up information on his employer. Posing as call girl Misty Cotton, she infiltrates the syndicate's front as a modeling agency to gain access inside the corrupt operation. Once inside, she sets it off as she shoots, stabs, runs over and sets fire to anyone who gets in her way.

Furthermore, the villain in this one just isn't scary, with her overwrought lines and lame ""I'm in charge"" banter; the sleazeball from ""Coffy"" was better because we didn't know exactly how the chips were going to fall until the very end. That tension is missing here, save for one scene where Grier is tortured and abandoned in a gruesome way. We actually get to feel a little tension.

However, I still feel that this below-average ""follow-up"" is more than a little disappointing, especially since ""Coffy"" really set a high bar, with a great cast driven by a lot of exciting dialogue and plot twists.

Thanks to the acquisition of a relatively cheap player and a cheaper subscription to a rental service, I can sit in front of the television set EVERY NIGHT and watch cult, exploitation, horror, action, and other films in dozens of genres that were next to impossible to find a few years ago. And if you could find a beat up VHS copy of a low budget classic, for example, you would pay top dollar for the privilege because you had to buy, not rent, the film. Video stores out where I live long ago quit carrying the sorts of films I longed to see. Heck, the last time I considered myself lucky at the local movie store was when I found an uncut version of Joe D'Amato's ""Buio Omega,"" under the name ""Buried Alive,"" at a major retailer well known for not carrying such cinematic treasures. And that was probably fifteen years ago! Yep, DVD is not only here to stay but also keeps growing by leaps and bounds. No film is too outrageous for rerelease on DVD, which is where Jack Hill's blaxploitation epics enter the picture.

First Hill gave us Pam Grier in the over the top ""Coffy."" The following year he gave us an eyeful of Pam again in ""Foxy Brown."" The latter film is a real hoot, a film that contains lots of sleazy scenes done with a style that only the 1970s could bring us. Grier stars as, not surprisingly, Foxy Brown, a woman just trying to do the right things in life. When her narcotics agent boyfriend Michael Anderson (Terry Carter) perishes at the hands of thugs in the employ of the notorious drug kingpin Katherine Wall (Kathryn Loder), it's time to kick some serious you know what! Foxy goes on her own undercover mission to bring down Wall and her vicious sidekick Steve Elias (Peter Brown), and she uses every asset she can to accomplish her task. Her job is made more difficult thanks to her no good drug dealing brother Link (Antonio Fargas), whose debts to Wall's operation virtually insure that he will do something that his sister finds morally reprehensible. Her brother initially turns to his sister for help when Wall's heavies turn up the heat, but it's all over when he learns about Foxy's boyfriend and how much his employers want this guy. Foxy must now turn against her own flesh and blood if she wants to seek revenge.

By posing as the voluptuous Misty Cotton, Foxy infiltrates Wall's personal harem in an effort to gather evidence against those responsible for her personal tragedy. What Brown discovers is an operation involved in all sorts of illicit activities, oftentimes activities that prey on the black community. In fact, Foxy will eventually enlist the assistance of a local Black Panther type group dedicated to the eradication of drugs in the community. In the process of righting wrongs, she makes friends with another working girl, discovers that corruption runs high up in the city's power structure, and narrowly survives a dangerous abduction. Foxy punches, stabs, shoots, kicks, and even sets fire to anyone who stands in her way. She's not above stashing weapons in her Afro, either. And she does it all while wearing the funkiest fashions these eyes have seen since Grier donned even more outrageous clothes in ""Coffy."" The conclusion to ""Foxy Brown"" ranks as one of the most jaw dropping denouements in cinematic history--at least in B movie history. It's sleazy and seedy, and completely fitting considering the film deals with a strong woman asserting herself.

""Foxy Brown"" isn't quite as good as ""Coffy,"" but it's darn close. I missed the excellent cat fighting sequences found in the first film, the razorblades in the Afro trick, and Grier's Jamaican accent. While there is a chick fight in a bar here, it isn't as well choreographed and isn't as much fun. The violence her also doesn't quite live up to Hill and Grier's earlier collaboration. ""Coffy"" had a nifty exploding head scene and a nasty sequence involving a guy being dragged by a car. ""Foxy Brown"" can't really compete with these outrageous scenes--aside from it's ending, of course--but it doesn't really matter. The film is still a blast as Grier does what she does best: kill the bad guys and look good doing it. Sid Haig even shows up in a small role as a fast talking pilot who falls under Foxy's charms and soon regrets his decision. There's even an unintentionally hilarious part at the end of the film when we hear a voice over say ""Superbaaaaad!"" as Grier gets in a car. Oh man, I laughed so hard my sides hurt when I heard that gem. But further reflection proves the veracity of that statement--Foxy is superbad, and in a great way that continues to entertain viewers who weren't even born when this film first arrived on the scene.

The extras on the disc include a very nice transfer of the film, a trailer, and another monotonous commentary from Jack Hill. While the guy made some great exploitation films, both blaxploitation and women in prison flicks, listening to his commentaries is often an excruciating experience. I still recommend giving them a quick pass through, however, since Hill always throws out a few intriguing comments about surviving the low budget filmmaking process. If you're just starting out with the blaxploitation genre, start with ""Coffy"" and then move on to this one. You'll like it.",1109635200,2,5442,4.719242902208202

As is the case with most of the blaxploitation
genre, if you're looking for depth and artistic
value, good luck and keep moving. But if you're in
the market for thoughtless, fun media,
BINGO!!!

I actually like this film, mainly because it's
a signature showcase for Pam Grier. She
combines brutal, sometimes psychotic strength
with a vulnerable, loveable sweetness.
She evokes compassion while also
satifsying the viewer's need for
vicarious revenge. Furthermore,
the ample display of flesh leaves
no question that she is indeed
a Woman foremost, and a vengeful
psychopath second.

Some of the scenes in this film are
too long, thus taking away from the total
action. Although there is
sufficient violence, I wish we could
see a more physical Foxy.
The fight sequences are basic and rudimentary.
Also, the final scene where she gets revenge
against the Lady Pimp is great! It is also a big
letdown because by this point in the film our
claws are sharpened, our fangs are bared, and
we're all panting rabidly for blood. And all we get is a flesh wound and poetic rhetoric
(""Death is too good for you , BITCH!!
I want you to suffer.....) Oh well (I think
all the actors suffered professionally from
this venture, minus the Foxy archetype herself,
of course).

Overall, I would recommend this film. It's a fun flick.

Hill's cartoonish screenplay gives Pam Grier nothing to work with in this cheesy revenge yarn that's more about skin instead of substance. She wants revenge for the murder of her boyfriend by the syndicate and will do anything to get the satisfaction of retribution. Almost every one of the paper-thin characters is just there for her to kill, maim, or injure. The film goes from campy to downright silly when a henchman gets ground up by an airplane propeller and the absurdity reaches a climax when Foxy pulls a pistol out of her Afro. Ugh!

154118,4,0792841980,"Following the success of her film Coffy (1973), Pam Grier appeared in this film, titled Foxy Brown (1974), which was originally intended to be a sequel to Coffy titled ""Burn, Coffy, Burn!"", but was changed for some unknown reason by those at American International Pictures prior to filming to be a stand alone film, featuring a different, yet similar character.  Written and directed by Jack Hill (Spider Baby, The Big Doll House, Switchblade Sisters), the film includes Antonio `Huggy Bear' Fargas (Cleopatra Jones, ""Starsky and Hutch""), Terry Carter (Abby, ""Battlestar Galactica""), Kathryn Loder (The Big Doll House), Sid Haig (Spider Baby, The Big Doll House), Juanita Brown (Caged Heat), and Peter Brown (Kitten with a Whip), who looks a lot like Bryan Cranston, the actor that played the father on the show ""Malcolm in the Middle"".

After an opening credit sequence obviously influenced by the works of Maurice Binder (Binder is probably best known for his opening credit sequences on many of the James Bond films) we see a character named Link Brown (Vargas)...he'll always be Huggy Bear to me...walking down the city street at night, being tailed by two hoodlum types in a car.  During a slight reprieve he phones his sister, namely one Foxy Brown (Grier) for help, providing our first shot of Ms. Grier's naughty pillows.  Just as Huggy, er...I mean Link is about to get a beat down of momentous proportions, Foxy shows up to save the day by running down the two muthas with her car.  Seems Link, a low level pusher among other things, has gotten into a local criminal organization for a whole lot of bread (twenty G's, to be exact), and now they're looking for payment...with his life!  Anyway, Link, being the sniveling, opportunistic worm he is decides to rat out Foxy's boyfriend Dalton (Carter), an undercover narcotics detective whose just had plastic surgery, to the gang in exchange for his skin, which results in Dalton, now known as Michael, ending up with a terminal case of lead poisoning.  After a vengeful Foxy beats the crud out of Link, she decides to infiltrate the gang, which is led by a woman named Catherine (Loder) and her pretty boy toy Steve (Brown).  Posing as a call girl, which the gang uses to appease local public officials (judges and what not) into looking the other way with regards to the criminal activities of those in their organization, Foxy soon finds herself a target of the gang, as they catch up with her after a brawl in a butch bar, and she's sent to an out of the way ranch where the gang processes their drugs.  While there Foxy suffers some serious abuse (and we get another showing of Pam's amazing boobage), to which she eventually gets her revenge via some coat hangers and gasoline (you'll have to see the movie if you want more), and continues her vendetta against the gang, enlisting the aide of some Black Panther types from the neighborhood, all leading up to one heck of a finale that includes someone losing a particularly vital appendage...

While I thought this film not as tight as Coffy, it's still a lot of fun and provides a good example why Ms. Grier deserves the crown of Queen of the Blaxpoiltation genre, a title she may, or may not, bear with some amount of pride.  As I mentioned earlier this film was originally meant to be a sequel to Coffy, but the powers that be at AIP decided not to go that route, and, as a result there are some weaknesses in terms of proper character development but that seems a fairly moot point as few went into this film looking for that kind of thing, even if it was present in Grier's earlier film.  Grier doesn't seem to have the intensity here as displayed in Coffy, but even at half speed she's still a lot of fun to watch...and the fact she didn't seem shy about showing off her voluptuous figure didn't hurt, either (the sequences here were good, but those in Coffy were better).  There's a number of memorable lines throughout the film, but the one that sticks out in my mind occurs when Foxy, posing as an escort, accompanies another woman to a gathering where they're supposed to provided entertainment for a sleazy judge.  As the old man corrals the girls into a separate room one of the Judge's friends yells out the following...

""That's an awful lot of chocolate for one man, Fred!""

Nice...I did learn a number of things throughout the course of this film, including the following...

1. Pam Grier's got a gargantuan rack.

2. Jumping into the sunroof of a speeding car probably isn't the best way to catch a ride.

3. Modeling agencies can sometimes be a front for escort services.

4. Old Caucasian men in positions of power are particularly piggish and skeevy.

5. Someone owns a pair of boxer shorts festooned with giant, red hearts and actually wears them.

6. The darker the meat the sweeter the berry, or so I've heard.

7. A barstool upside the head beats a black belt around the waist every time.

8. Lesbians like Coors Beer.

9. Pam Grier is very talented with her tongue, enough so she can use it to pick up a razor blade left on a nightstand while tied to a bed.

10. Never stand in front of the propeller of a moving plane (especially when an African American woman with a grudge is driving).

11. Frisking Pam Grier for weapons is probably the biggest perk that henchmen ever got..

12. A giant Afro makes a great place to hide a gun.

Director Hill keeps things moving along with lots of action, including some pretty graphic violence, although the worst bits aren't shown (Foxy's defilement at the ranch, Steve's fate) but rather left to the viewer's imagination.  There's also a good deal of racial slurs tossed about, primarily by the often overly sadistic, antagonistic elements in the film (all of whom happen to be Caucasian), followed up those issuing said remarks getting their just comeuppance.  While Foxy Brown may not be the best in the genre, it's still better than a lot of the features cranked out at the time, particularly due to Hill's capabilities and willingness to get downright nasty, for lack of a better term.

The picture, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks very clean and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through clearly.  Extras include an audio commentary track with writer/director Jack Hill, an original theatrical trailer, and subtitles in both French and Spanish (no English).  It would have been nice if they could have gotten Ms. Grier involved on the commentary, but oh well...

By the way, there are a couple of boxed DVD sets out there with Pam Grier's films (one's called `Fox in a Box' and the other is called `The Best of Soul Cinema DVD Collection', both released by MGM), so if you're interested in buying this film, you might want to check out the availability on those sets as it might save you some green rather than buying the films individually.",1050969600,6,6872,4.702251876563803
154119,4,0792841980,"Ignore all the blather about ""blaxploitation"" and ""camp"", this is two-fisted B-action movie with an involving story, a kickass performance (from Ms. Grier) and joltingly  brutal scenes of action violence.
Getting a hoot out of the period costumes and attitudes is great, but anyone who enjoys a fierce action film will probably be blown away by this flick, which plays like an episode of 'Starsky & Hutch' directed by Paul Verhoeven.  At times it seems that the sleazier and more violent a scene gets, the more craft and skill writer/director Jack Hill brings to it.  What audiences thought about it at the time of its original release can only be imagined, but almost any modern viewer is likely to be stunned as Foxy goes up against a degenerate bunch of sleazoids and realistically (and literally) takes them apart.
Still strong to this day, 'Foxy Brown' makes most modern action flicks look like episodes of 'Matlock'.",1041638400,,922,4.935483870967742
154120,4,0792841980,"Both at the time of it's 1974 release--and today, this movie has received harsh criticism from critics too eager to consign it to history's trash heap. This is rather unfortunate because the low-budget screenplay has much to offer American society.

Yes, there is a large amount of violence and sexual scenes throughout Pam Grier's star vehicle, but ""blaxploitation"" movies were not designed to show the world as pristine and sweet. Instead, the gritty plot (and ironically, the retrospective filming tecniques) remind the audience that the world isn't always safe and there are people who do have a ""rough life"" but can and do hold their own in that world. On top of that, the protagonists actively dedicate themselves to stopping the injustice without appology or compromise.

For the cultural studies or social scientist, the film also shines by allowing us to see race, socioecconomic status and gender issues continously explored throughout the release. Even if wardrobe and props look severely dated, the screen play's plot (and subsequently raised ""food for thought"") has kept it's relevancy.

When Foxy goes undercover in Ms. Katherine's harem, she finds the clients are white male politicians, a commentary on power exploitation that ironically resurfaced with Anita Hill's treatment before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee many years later. Indeed, when Foxy is fighting men, the antagonist is usally white, ecconomically poweful, and sexually lecherous.

At the same time, both a reference to people with disabilities as ""cripple"" (disability rights had not yet permeated the nation in 1974)and caricature of most lesbians (sans a sympathetic bystander in the bar)as 'evil and sadistic' virtually guarantee this movie cannot ever be classified as a ""politically correct"" production. Individuals watching this feature need to take the above scenes with a grain of salt.

Still, despite portions of the screen play, and over the top 70's fashion, it is a cut far above such white ""camp"" as the 60's Batman feature film or the 1992 introduction to Buffy. If you want strong women, get a hold of this movie.",1027728000,15,2126,5.259587020648968

Foxy is a hip, tough urban African-American woman who eventually takes on an evil white madam and her crime organization. There is a strong anti-drug mesage, with illegal drugs being depicted as a new form of enslavement in the black community. Although the film is occasionally campy, it nevertheless is very effective as a crime drama.
""Foxy"" has a gritty, low budget feel. There is a lot of graphic violence, and some outrageous humor. The film is full of great quotable lines, like ""You just take care of the justice, and I'll handle the revenge myself.""

As it stands, it's pretty much just a decent plot filled with distractions caused by a parade of terrible acting and outrageous '70s fashion (the latter of which, however, is really almost reason enough to see the film).
Pam Grier, despite her great sassy attitude and onscreen confidence, seems plagued by terrible delivery of her lines. (There are zero successes, but several attempts at delivering some decent one-liners.) Fortunately, however, Grier's inablility at delivery is overshadowed by the awful acting of Katheryn Loder, who might just have given one of the worst performances I've ever seen by an actress. None of the cast, however, seems particularly talented, with the best being Juanita Brown as the callgirl Claudia and Antonio Fargas as Foxy's perfectly inept, hoodlum brother, Link.
It's still a decent flick, though maybe not one you want to put too highly on your ""must see"" list. If the fashion doesn't draw you in, it's worth seeing for Grier's great action scenes and the often laughable and seemingly endless amount of random sexual situations to be found here.

Foxy goes after the organization that slew her beau in cold blood. And in the end the organization regrets ever making Foxy their enemy. Foxy was so tenacious! Nothing could stop her! not being beaten, being raped and being drugged. Everyone who messed with her either died horrible deaths, were shot or were horribly mutilated!
