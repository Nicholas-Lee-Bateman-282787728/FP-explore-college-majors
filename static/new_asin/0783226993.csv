65791,4,0783226993,"I've just watched "" The Getaway"" on TV in my home at Hong Kong. This film is not only intriguing, but also extremly exciting! There isn't a single mintue that you'll feel your time be wasted watching the movie.
I just want to say every aspect of the film will not disappoint you. The reason why the movie is not well-known perhaps because the casting stars are not famous enough. Its always like that. To me, all the casting stars are marvellous, story intriguing, the scene exciting, the film song perfect. I'll give it 4.5 star.",1043971200,,530,4.53125
65792,4,0783226993,"The Baldwin/Basinger remake of ' The Getaway ' is a well put together, well acted, entertaining movie. This was not well received upon release, and I can't see why. Baldwin smolders on screen, and his real life chemistry with Basinger ( well, until they divorced ) carries over to the movie. The relationship of their married characters is passionate, and volatile. An excellent scene is when Doc, who can't control his anger any longer after finding out that Carol had slept with bad-guy Benyon ( James Woods ) in a deal for Doc's prison release, stops their car on the side of the road, and they have an intense argument. Great scene. Not to be overlooked is the performance of Michael Madsen as Rudy. He could be Vic Vega's ( from Reservoir Dogs ) dopier cousin. He is a bad guy, yet his scenes with Jennifer Tilly are at times very funny..you'll laugh at what a jerk he can be. The movie has some good action and drama in it, especially the scene when Doc, at the train depot, chases down the small-time thief who has made off with Doc and Carol's bag full of stolen cash. The finale is an excellent shoot-out at a seedy old hotel in El Paso, and it definitely does not disappoint. Much action and tension. The final scene includes the late Richard Farnsworth, and it is touching to see now that he is no longer alive. An excellent Richard Marx song ' Now and Forever ' runs over the end credits, and it works perfectly. Very nice. This is a movie I've seen many times, and always enjoyed. It's executed well, with nice cinematography. Don't believe some of the bad reviews, and judge for yourself. I believe the 1994 version of ' The Getaway ' is an overlooked little gem.",1017619200,29,1677,4.483660130718954
65793,4,0783226993,"Okay, the plot is a little thin, the bad guys are a tad on the black and white side, and the believability rating is somwhere between Star Wars and Fantasia, but you have to love any movie that Kim Basinger [reveals all], and anyone who just enjoys a good shoot-'em-up... will get a charge out of this one.  Leave your intellect at the door and enter one helluva thrill ride.. definitely an ""E"" ticket attraction and well worth the price of admission.  Anyone looking for The Lion in Winter will undoubtedly be disappointed and anyone watching with the eyes of your average critic will find so much to write a bad revue about there could be a book in the works.  But, remember this.. Kim Basinger is... in this movie.  Thank God for Hollywood.",997920000,5,743,4.522388059701493
65794,5,0783226993,"Somewhat like  the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair this is again much better than the original, and I love McQeen.
Baldwin is great, Kim Bassinger is very believable and Madsen superb as the bad guy.  James Woods is wonderful too.
Great direction by Roger Donaldson, the locations are well thought out and easy on the eyes too.
All in all a splendid update of the orgiginal, which wasn't bad but this is one remake that is well worth owning.  Great film.

65795,2,0783226993,"What a crazy piece of work this is. I do not mind remakes so much, but really this is too much. Whole scenes have been copied directly from the original Peckinpah movie and nowhere is there any improvement. On the  contrary! Basinger is not to bad, but I liked Ali McGraw better in the  part. Steve McQueen was a hundred times better than Alec Baldwin, Donaldson  is no Peckinpah and through it all I missed Quincy Jones' excellent score.  The story is practically the same, but without the taut suspence of the  original. Michael Madson and Jennifer Tilly steal the show and while they  do a good job, they are not supposed to carry the movie. Now you start  thinking them the interesting part and the bit about the McCoys running to  Mexico with all gangland USA on their tale becomes an anoying sideline.  Don't bother to watch this one. It is nothing better than any other action  movie. Stick with the original!",951177600,4,916,4.564417177914111
65796,4,0783226993,"Like Tom and Nicole in ""Eyes Wide Shut"", Alec and Kim do a fantastic job and play the roles made famous by Mcqueen and Mcgraw Brilliantly. This fresh, vibrant remake takes it a bit further than the  original due to modern-day censors, (in Australia this film was given an R  rating)which gives the film a very gritty feel. But the film belongs to  star couple Alec and Kim who both do some of there best work ever. (the  Getaway is Kim's best along with L.A Confidential and it's Alec's best  along with the Hunt for Red October) On whole, I like it better than the  original because of its harsh realism, its brilliant cast, which also  includes James Woods and Micheal Madsen, and really because Kim is sooo  Good looking.",942969600,5,724,4.515384615384615

65848,2,0783226993,"Thieves/gangsters are involved in a heist involving a Mexican. As the police move in a couple of the American thieves leave the one behind. He goes to prison. He hatches a plan to get himself out of a Mexican jail by sending his wife to another thief/gangster who supposedly is so powerful he can arrange for the guy to get out of the jail. He does. So they start off on a new heist. This time things turn even bloodier. Everyone starts killing each other after the heist. And a chase ensues.

Umm. I have no idea what the appeal is about this movie for anyone. All the characters are horrible people. There are a couple of sex scenes with Bassinger and Baldwin where she is completely naked. Is that it? Who knows what drives people. I was sitting here thinking how odd a real-life couple would do that on film. How a husband would want his wife filmed like that. Sickos. Anyway even those scenes were passionless. There was just no chemistry. Bassinger didn't come off as believable in any of this. Baldwin is his usual so-so actor self. The others are odd.

It is sad though. This could have been one of those go-to movies to frame Baldwin and Bassinger's marriage. Maybe it did. But wouldn't it have been nostalgic and romantic if they had made this great movie together--capturing it on film--before they divorced to make people wish/hope that they would get back together? Oh well.

But if you don't want to take my word for it just know that that weirdo Jennifer Tilly is in this movie. She has such a high creep factor that you know this movie is just bad by her association.",1449187200,,1583,4.470588235294118

instead of the garbage he gets thrown into most of the time! How come he never made it BIG as a Dirty Harry or Action hero type is a mystery
like Rutger Hauer too! Two of the best actors out there seem to have been wasted in Hollyweird! The ending is the only thing I have a problem

65907,5,0783226993,"I agree with Mr. Lenhardt's review. This movie was underrated and did not get its due in my opinion. This review is for the video version I taped and saw years ago on cable.

The movie was lambasted when it came out and was subsequently reviewed. Here are some quotes from Leonard Maltin's Two-Star review of the movie in his book. ""Action, violence and sex by the numbers in this half-hearted remake of the 1972 hit; even the usually dynamic Woods seems to be just going through the motions. Watching [Then] real life couple Baldwin and Bassinger make love is uncomfortably voyeuristic. It takes Farnsworth in the film's closing moments to bring it to life. One sexy scene added for video.""

I must disagree with everything from the above quote-with the exception of the memorable cameo by the late great Richard Farnsworth. It's true that James Woods played a similar character 10 years earlier in Against All Odds, ironically another remake of an earlier film. Yet I didn't get the idea that he was just going through the motions. I felt he did a fine and admirable job with the material he was given to perform. No, this remake is not half-hearted, and while I must admit that I have not seen the original from 40 years ago, I do plan to get it on DVD. Concerning the love scene being ""voyeuristic"" I must agree even less with this. Basinger did partial nudity because she was with her husband and felt comfortable with him. In the movie Final Analysis, her love scene with Richard Gere is shot with a body double. All love scenes by their nature are voyeuristic. That is why they are made for a movie, to show the characters' passion for one another. That Basinger and Baldwin were a couple at the time should not have made Maltin (Or Whoever Wrote The Piece) uncomfortable in any way.

I won't do a synopsis of the movie, I'll just say this: Buy both versions and you will not be disappointed.

65915,4,0783226993,"Boy. You have to be a sucker for pain or completely devoid of original ideas to want to re-make a Sam Peckinpah film. ""The Getaway"" was not one of his best films (""Wild Bunch"", ""Ride the High County"", ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"") but it was clearly up there  in his top 5, and a top 5 film from Peckinpah is still better than 99+% of any film ever made. If you have to re-make a Peckinpah film why not choose some of his failed attempts, like ""Straw Dogs"" or ""Killer Elite"" or ""The Osterman Weekend"". But why pick one of his best?

That's the central problem in evaluating this film. Scene by scene I can't help but compare it to the original, and the original was so good, the re-make has to suffer. Alex Baldwin, for example, is a very good actor and he does a very good job in this film, but he isn't Steve McQueen, is he? And James Woods is a great actor, but he hardly fills the shoes of Ben Johnson in this case. It's like that right up and down the line with only a few exceptions - Ali McGraw was the weak point in the original and Kim Bassinger does a much better job, and Michael Madsen does a better job than Al Lettieri, even though Lettieri was surprisingly good in the original.

Of course, the central comparison is between Peckinpah and Roger Donaldson. Roger Donaldson you ask. Who the heck is he? Donaldson is an Australian born New Zealander who is best known for directing the Mel Gibson/Anthony Hopkins version of ""The Bounty"" (1984). So apparently Donaldson IS a sucker for pain, trying to remake the classic Clark Gable/Charles Laughton ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935) and now taking on Peckinpah.

Donaldson is not without talent. His work on films like ""Species"" (1995), ""No Way Out"" (1987), and ""The Bank Job"" (2008) is very good, and some of his lesser films are not bad either - ""Cadillac Man"" (1990), ""Thirteen Days"" (2000). But...

I know a film should stand on its own and not have to be compared to the original, but it's virtually impossible to do that. Moreover, when it comes to a suspense thriller, the idea of making a re-make is pretty stupid. Can you really remake ""Psycho""?  Who thought ""High Noon"" could be improved upon?

Some films can be remade and the difference between the original and the remake is minimal. Both versions of ""Cape Fear"" (1962 vs. 1991) were compelling. Both most times the original is a clear favorite. Sometimes the producers think that if they take a special effects film and re-make it, the improvement in special effects will turn the remake into a better film. Good idea, but usually wrong. Here's some remade sci fi films where the special effects were turned up but the original story still remained the better one - ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951 vs. 2008), ""King Kong"" (1933 vs. 1976 vs. 2005), ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956 vs. 1978).

Remaking a film is great when you add a twist to it. The ""Seven Samurai"" (1954) was great as was ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960), because they remade it in a different setting/time/place. Ditto for ""Yojimbo"" (1961) which became ""A Fistfull of Dollars"" (1964). ""Four Brothers"" (2005) updated ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965).

One of the key plot points in ""The Getaway"" is whether or not they get away. Once you've seen the original, you know. So the suspense is taken away, or at best, substantially reduced. Well, in a suspense drama, what more do you have than the suspense? Reduce that, and you damn well better have some terrific acting, some revolutionary photography, or something to fill the void.

""Getaway"" was one of Peckinpah's most successful films, earning $35 million in 1972 dollars. The 1994 remake made $30 million. On a budget of $16 million that made it a successful film, but much less successful than the original.

OK. Viewers of the original will be disappointed! But what if you never saw the original - is this a good film. Yes it is. You could do a lot worse. But if you want to view only one version of this film, view the original.",1302307200,,3988,4.555865921787709

Bassinger has one of the steamiest scenes I've ever seen on a mainline film (my VHS tape was the ""unrated"" version) but at least it was with her real-life husband (at the time) Alec Baldwin.

This re-make of the 1972 film also has Michael Madsen, James Woods, Mike Morse and Jennifer Tilley - all playing sleazy characters. They are so bad they make Baldwin & Bassinger look like monks! This movie is not exactly Mary Poppins. There's almost too much of a mean edge to it....almost. Perhaps I enjoy ogling Bassinger too much to can this movie for its baseness.

65935,4,0783226993,"Early in this 1994 remake of the 1972 movie ""The Getaway"" Alec Baldwin (Doc McCoy) tells Kim Bassinger (Carol McCoy) that is she isn't happy with being the wife of a robber that she should have married a dentist. But she didn't and she adapts quite nicely to being a gun moll. She is as good a shot as her husband.

Of course this remake based on Jim Thompson's novel invites comparison with the 1972 Steve McQueen version. Alec Baldwin is certainly no Steve McQueen so he is just a different Doc but in all most every way as effective as McQueen in the original. He is much more emotional with an anger burning just under the surface that erupts often, unlike the taciturn McQueen. Bassinger is even better as his wife Carol and is a much more talented, expansive actress than MacGraw. No cringing vine is she as she gives as good as she gets. James Woods plays the Jack Benyon role here and Philip Seymour Hoffman, before the world knew who he was, is one of the henchmen who works with McCoy on the robbery. In this instance the robbers hit a safe at a dog racetrack rather than a bank. But except for that change and a few minor others, this version sticks closely to the original. One obvious reason is that Walter Hill wrote the screenplay for both movies.

Married in real life, Bassinger and Baldwin burn up the screen in their bedroom scenes. And for those keeping score, there is a lot of Ms. Bassinger to see. My problem with the movie is that I saw it on the heels of watching the McQueen version so there was little if any suspense for me. This of course is no fault of anyone connected with the Bassinger-Baldwin film.",1186704000,,1632,4.400662251655629

65947,4,0783226993,"While ""The Getaway"" has been widely perceived as a flop of a remake, I've always considered this movie to be one of the better and more intriguing actions flicks of the 90's.  The action in this movie is pretty much non stop and only slows down for some intriguing, if not gratuitous, love scenes between the film's two main stars, Alec Baldwin and the ever beautiful Kim Basinger.  The film is further enhanced with well played out performances by Michael Madsen, Jennifer Tilly, James Woods and several other bit players.

Although this film was a remake and ""generally"" followed along the same lines as the original movie, one can definitely say that director Roger Donaldson made this movie his own.  Given other film credits such as ""No Way Out"" and ""The Bounty,"" I'd definitely put this film amongst his best list.  The score for the film plays into the film rather seamlessly.

The Premise:

Master criminal Doc McCoy (Alec Baldwin) and his wife, Carol (Kim Basinger) find themselves in the position of having to do ""one"" last job after Carol negotiates Doc's way out of a Mexican prison.  What follows is no less than an exceptional action flick with all the usual tricks; gun battles, betrayal, car chases and a memorable performance by Jennifer Tilly playing a sexy twit.

Overall, this film delivers both drama and action quite well and it effortlessly pushes from scene to scene leading up to an excellent finale.  I would highly recommend this film to any and all.  {ssintrepid}

65948,3,0783226993,"Both Getaway movies have the same screenplay writen by Walter Hill, both have the slow-mo action and basically they are the same, BUT here are the differences:

Getaway 1972:

* Steve McQueen is WAY COOLER than Alec Bladwin.
* Rudy and his girl are more evil here.
* The car chase scene is at midnight.
* There is no STUPID dog race scene, only a bank robbery scene.
* The characters here are more quiet.
* The first getaway scene is COOLER and EXPLOSIVE!
* The train scene here is a CLASSIC.
* The slap scene is more intense here.
* The jail scenes here are longer.

Getaway 1994:
* There are more emotional scenes in this one.
* Kim Basinger's character is tougher and hotter!
* There are MORE celebrities here than in the original.
* The car chase scene was longer.
* There are sex scenes in this one.
* There is more blood and foul language here than in the original.
* They added one made-up action scene in the begining.
* There is a one to one fight between Rudy and Doc.

In my opinion the Getaway 1972 is better because SteveMcQueen is SOO COOL! you can watch the 1994 remake if you want to but that one is more like a normal action movie than a CLASSIC action movie.

65950,4,0783226993,"Ive seen this remake 2 or three times, same number of times as original, the original is no dispute a great McQueen crime action adventure, but yes, this remake  I feel with the noir fence-wash rinse is a great night in, why do professional critics like Maltin seem to have it up with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes??

the action is great,start to finish,  all three main characters make a fair fist of stepping into McQueen, McGraw and Al Lettieri's shoes, Bassingers character as the Amazon ed points out is a lot more hands on than McGraw, shes much more of a true Bonnie and Clyde gangsters moll instead of mcGraws passive passenger ""I'll just maybe dosome of the driving , you'll have to shoot everybody yourself "" approach.

Which is kinduv cool, frankly.

 She knows better than to have a go when Doc slaps her around in one scene, which may be more  about she feels actual guilt for what she has done  ( for him, mind you) rather than she hasn't got the stones to try to defend herself.

Certainly she has no problem later first blowing David Morse's kneecap out with a .45, and then blowing the rest of him away after it. YaY girlpower, huh?

She is in the thick of the gunbattle.

the final rootin-tootin confrontation at the hotel is a screamer, as was the original, Baldwins face when he thinks Madsen has won and will kill him is about right underplayed.

Some criticise the scenes with Meg Tilly and her unfortunate veterinarian husband and his fate, ok, the show is of course one for after the kids are in bed. I don't personally find it gratuitous, is an eye-opener and more Noir, sure.

My sole disappointment was the writing out of the confrontation between McQueen and two Texas rangers outside a hamburger shop in the original , where McQueen hastily goes next door and arms himself by robbing a gunstore , then bails these cops up, disarms them without having to harm them, and shoots up their patrol car, before blowing town.

The Baldwin movie has no mention of this memorable scene.

Original was a tough act to follow, sure, but this stands alone well, is a good night in is totally above average popcorn entertainment, I like it, recommended if you can take a kind of commercial/Noir split which I think works.",1158710400,5,2235,4.5664160401002505

There is a lot of nudity and sexuality that was obviously thrown in to pander to the audience. One scene I found to be to be needlessly creepy and disturbing; Kidnapper Madsen and turncoat Tilly have sex in front of her anguished, captive husband, cruelly taunting him while he gruesomely kills himself.

This movie can't decide if it is a fast, fun, bubblegum action romp or a brooding allegory for something darker. It finds itself in middle ground that just doesn't work.",1114041600,11,667,4.741379310344827
65953,3,0783226993,"I never saw the original movie  with  Steve McQueen, so  I cannot judge the Alec Baldwin version on a comparative basis. I read the professional Leonard  Maltin review first before watching  the DVD version and felt that  Maltin went over the top in condemning this version. I would put it in the  great ""silly movie"" genre (if there is such a thing). The appropriate title for this movie should have been ""Against All Odds"" if that title had not  already been used in a much inferior action  movie (starring Jeff Bridges and James Woods).

 Like  silly action films this is  not a movie to be taken too seriously and it is certainly not a classic. However, the cast  is well chosen for the roles and the acting is superb. I have seen James Wood in much better movie roles  than the one he accepted here but he came over very nicely as the ice cold bastard. The action was continuous with ample gore and  a few bits of titillating steamy sex thrown in which can only be described as pretty innocent ""mushy"" porn. Only the most prudish critics would object, I've seen steamier sex in  some ordinary commercials and local soap operas aired on  regular Greek TV channels. This is not a sex film it is  mayhem with a few funny bits thrown in such as the plight of the heroic couple when they find themselves inside a garbage disposal truck. There are plenty of twists and turns in the movie. It's object was to  entertain and amuse us in this far from amusing world of today.

65954,2,0783226993,"The remake of this classic film is O.K.  It certainly doesn't leave you with that lingering sense of having just witnessed one heck of a prize fight like the original movie, which starred the ineffable Steve McQueen.  Without a doubt, the action scenes of this remake are enjoyable and the acting is decent, but what it lacks is a quality you can hardly blame Alec Baldwin for lacking.  It lacks the unflappable, self-composed nuance and aesthetic action appeal that Steve Mcqueen brought to every role he ever encontered.  This is not to say that Alec Baldwin isn't good at the roles he typically takes on, that is, the role of the villian; but when recruited to play the hero, no matter how hard one trys, one just simply does not find himself rooting for Alex Baldwin.  Perhaps this is because Baldwin plays himself, just as Steve McQeeun played himself; but there is no doubt that the measured and controlled hard-guy approach of McQueen is far more compelling as the hero than is the inflated braggadocio and swarthy arrogance of Baldwin.  Nevertheless, even with the bad casting of the lead role, the remake is entertaining.  However, the better choice for your entertainment dollar will always be the original.",1107561600,3,1217,4.85024154589372
65955,3,0783226993,"I've never seen the original version of this film, so I have nothing to compare it to. Most of the reviews here are pretty good, but the reviewers weren't kind when it first came out in 1994. I thought the acting by Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin was very good in this. Michael Madsen usually plays these same kind of characters all of the time, but he was actually enjoyable here. I loved that Kim's character more than held her own here and got very violent like everybody else. I can't stand when female characters always have to be saved in action films. The camerawork & pacing is excellent in this film also. My main problem with this film is the story itself. It starts out pretty good for like the first 45 minutes, then starts to get kinda silly once Jennifer Tilly's character shows up. I kept asking myself why would some of the characters do something so dumb thoughtout the movie. I also was able to predict almost everything that happened. That was probably because they had alot of actors who always play bad guys like: James Wood, Michael Madsen, David Morse, and even Alec himself. Note to directors out there, ""quit hiring the same actors to play your bad guys all of the time, its starting to get annoying."" I just never bought that the guy, who Jennifer's character was married to, ever had a chance of ever getting her. And I know women like bad guys, but I just never bought that she could easily watch Michaels character abuse her husband of 2 years like she did. The action in this film is pretty good I must admit though. Forget about the plot, watch this film for the action and the performances by Kim, Alec, and Michael. Kim's sensual scenes with Alec will have you pausing and hitting the review button alot.

7790595,5,0783226993,"I actually enjoyed this version better than the original with Steve McQueen, which says a lot.

Alec Baldwin plays Doc McCoy, a professional thief in demand. When a Mexican drug dealer is being transferred from a New York prison to a more secure one, Doc comes up with a brilliant, simple plan to spring him. He succeeds, and with his partner, Rudy, they fly the man to Mexico where the man's uncle is waiting to accept his nephew and pay Doc and Rudy off for their work. But the deal goes bad. Doc is framed for murder, and Rudy gets away, returning to the States.

Doc's wife is played by the beautiful Kim Basinger. She visits Doc in prison, and he tells her he knows of a man in Arizona who does 'business' on both sides of the border. He wants Kim to tell him he's for sale. Doc's wife does this, but when she meets Benyon, the man Doc wants to help spring him free, Benyon wants more than Doc.... much more!

Doc is released from prison and meets Benyon, who tells him he wants him to 'hit' a dog track in Arizona. Apparently the owners of the field are cutting Benyon free and Benyon wants to get even by taking down their vault. ""There's two or three million dollars in that vault,"" he tells Doc. ""Maybe more.""

Doc is paired with his wife and Rudy, who he still doesn't trust, and a second-rate thief named Hanson (played by a young little-known actor at that time, Phillip Thomas Hoffman). After hitting the dog track, things go wrong. Rudy turns on Doc and his wife. Doc and his wife make a getaway with all the cash, but Benyon's people want the money.... and them!

Chased by the mob and the police, Doc and his wife make a run for a hotel in El Paso where a man there can provide them with papers that'll get them across the border into Mexico nice and clean. But they have to get there first.

This was a good movie for Alec and Kim. They were married at the time. The director did a fine job using scenes similar to the original, like slow-moving action scenes (something Sam Peckinpah was well-known for). Both movies are better than the book, which I read and was very disappointed. It's good movie even by today's standards.",1513987200,,2143,4.358395989974937
