4114421,5,B003ELPHE6,"I started watching this series in the 3rd season, & even thou I have seen some of the 1st two season this was a great way to make sure I seen them all. Plus I can watch them any time & this is one of those show I can rewatch after not seeing it for a while.",1283817600,,257,3.526315789473684
4114422,4,B003ELPHE6,"As a fan of Kathy Reichs, I wasn't pleased in the initial season in the casting and the setting, not to mention the continuing drive for the gross factor that the series represents.  But I have come to like the ensemble cast and their ability to relate to one another, because when an ensemble cast works well, it's wonderful and it shows throughout the series.  Each year the cast has only gotten better.  Emily Deschanel, as Temperance, has had the foresight to not try to play the role in the books, but has taken it in a  new direction.  That such a beautiful woman should be so clueless in human relationships, and so lacking in empathy makes her character more interesting, and she has some throw away lines that are great, such as when she sees how Booth (David Boreanz), the FBI agent,( a character not found in the books but well developed here, and a perfect foil for Temperance) who is capable of reacting with human emotions, and Temperance turns to the shrink and says ""That!  I want to learn how to do that!"" as if empathy is something that can be taught!  Another precious throw away is that the lead character in the series Temperance's book is named Kathy Reichs, the author of the popular novels the series is based (loosely) on.  If one becomes a fan of the series, as I have, there are many such throw aways that come to light on re-viewing.",1277337600,,1361,4.481781376518219
4114423,5,B003ELPHE6,Perfect way to catch up on Bones if you have not seen all the episodes.  Great price and fast shipping.  Love that I don't have to watch any commercials!,1277164800,,153,4.241379310344827
4114424,5,B003ELPHE6,"I love it! I've pretty much been re-watching the series over and over again. I can honestly say that I'm pretty much obsessed with Bones at the moment. Also, the item arrived much sooner than I expected, which was very exciting! I'm extremely glad that I decided to order it!",1276560000,2,275,4.52
4114425,5,B003ELPHE6,"Loved this show when I received it on satilite, I moved and satilite was unavailable. Saw the dvd's on sale during a gold box deal and snapped them up! I love this show and enjoyed watching the older episodes as well as the new ones I hadnt seen, great deal with many many hours of enjoyment. A great buy!
The extras that are on the disks are very enjoyable as well as provided a few laughs.",1274572800,,391,4.157894736842105
4114426,5,B003ELPHE6,"""Bones"" is great. Yeah, there's the usual procedural forensic stuff, but the characters are more interesting than on most of the competition.  ""Bones"" herself is particularly interesting; her social ineptitude contrasted with her academic mastery can be both funny and touching, and almost unique on television (see Big Bang Theory if you prefer a straight comedy).  As the father of an Asperger's son who is exceptionally bright but doesn't get social cues that others do, her character, and that of her assistant, Zack, in the first few seasons, can be particularly poignant while still being entertaining.",1272931200,4,608,5.322916666666667
4114427,1,B003ELPHE6,"This review is for the set offering not the series which is great.

I love Bones but why would anyone buy this set offering for $160.00 when you can buy each season separately and have all four season for $129.46?

C'mon Amazon get out the calculators.",1272758400,19,252,4.456521739130435

8395559,5,B003ELPHE6,"I love this series. The characters and plots are interesting, funny and surprising. Its neat to see how the ""dead bodies"" look so real and yet they are fake. I recommend this series to people who like CSI type shows.",1389312000,,216,4.425
8395560,5,B003ELPHE6,What is not to like - new and all there - Took less than four days to receive the item snail mail,1357430400,,97,3.4545454545454546
8395561,5,B003ELPHE6,"I saw Buffy the Vampire Slayer (fantastic) and Angel (also fantastic) and that is where I fell in love with David (I can never pronounce his last name--sorry fellow).  I had to get Bones although I wasn't sure I'd like it. BOY WAS I WRONG!! This show is sooo good; all the characters give such realistic performances you forget they are acting.
I wasn't nuts about the rest of the cast but that changed in record time. This is a show I took a chance on and I was fabulously rewarded. For those who don't know this is, in my mind, far better than all the CSI's put together and I have all of them as well.
The forensic details are from the real thing; they really do put those bones together and figure out how a person died and make the bare skull into a face. I don't even know how to get in all the wonders of this show but suffice it to say you will NOT be taking a chance on this one!!! I have all six years and I can't wait for the seventh!!!
GO BONES (and lower the price so I can get it faster--distributors  are such pigs-you make enough money--give us poor folk a better deal!).
Remember-you won't want to miss a single episode!!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!

8395562,3,B003ELPHE6,"I gave this item 3 stars simply because Bones is an amazing show. Aside from that, this set is ridiculously overpriced because you can buy each individual season for about $20 new. Which would add up to about $80 not $117.",1320278400,2,222,4.439024390243903
8395563,1,B003ELPHE6,"I purchased the first 4 seasons of Bones during a Gold Box special on Amazon several months ago.

So far, I am very unhappy. The discs are poorly made and I am receiving errors on several of them in all seasons. I thought perhaps it was just my computer, so tried in two other DVD players and another computer - still getting skip errors and pixelation like it's a bad bootleg instead of legit DVDs.

I still haven't made it through Season 4, but if that set of discs is as bad as the other three seasons, they are all going back to Amazon for a replacement or refund.",1299628800,5,568,4.201834862385321
