8324031,1,B000B5KSKG,"This has to be one of the worst Tupac DVD releases out there. It features a bunch of his fans talking about Pac's legacy. Nothing wrong with that but this people did not even know Pac on a personal level! Its no different than me and my boys gettig together and talking about how much Pac influenced us and video taping it.  On top of that the concert footage they have featured doesn't have audio. You get to watch Pac on stage moving his lips but you can't hear what he's saying. Last, it features a corny interview with him and Chris Rock. This is terrible, don't waste your money. You'll get better footage of Pac on YouTube!",1165104000,5,629,4.330508474576271
