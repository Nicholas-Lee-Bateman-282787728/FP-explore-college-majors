8481287,5,B005OJCQ9U,"I don't ever remember seeing this show on Discovery so I am glad I found them here, and they had the best price for the complete DVD set (3 DVDs)  If you're a fan of Bear Grylls and liked his Man vs Wild show, then it only makes sense to get this collection!  Bear takes you through 3 different (per disc) disaster scenarios and shows you how to safely get out of them.  I watched three episodes so far and wonder why this show didn't last longer than it did, considering the start to finish quality of them....but these are scenarios that the average day to day person could experience and the way Bear shows you how to escape them are realistic and helpful.  And no gross things to eat!
FOLLOW-UP:  I realize why I got these at such a good price--the DVDs are region 2 so they don't play on our home DVD player, but they do play on my computer so they're not a total loss.  To be fair, the seller didn't really give a description about the product and it would be helpful in the future to indicate whether the discs are region 1 or 3 coded, as it may make a huge difference for someone else later.  As it is, I can watch these on my computer and still enjoy them.",1360022400,2,1165,4.151111111111111
