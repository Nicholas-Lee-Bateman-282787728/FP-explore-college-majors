8761453,3,B01FSGKK78,"I was confused and ultimately dismayed by this production.  I liked the lighting, stagecraft and singing.  But totally put off by the decision to produce in modern dress.  Worse than confusing, it is pointless and repulsive depicting the Romans as Nazis!  A shame because there is much good music and talent here...wasted!  Overall impression is a mixture of a concert performance and early rehearsals.  Ill conceived, cheap production!",1484352000,,436,5.338235294117647

8761455,5,B01FSGKK78,"Poliuto is an opera I have loved for decades, ever since I encountered the live '60 Callas/Corelli/Bastianini performance. This excellent production from Glyndebourne makes an excellent case for the work, which is among Donizetti's strongest and most compact. A clear, easily-understood libretto makes a fine foundation for exciting musical situations. Michael Fabbiano continues his vertiginous ascent with a fearless, athletic portrayal of the tilte role. He doesn't displace Corelli, instead he seems inspired by that larger-than-life singer. Fabbiano gives at least 100%, just what this part needs. Martinez sings beautifully, although her very top seems perhaps a little detached from the rest of the voice, and she acts with sensitivity and style. Igor Golavatenko is a formidable presence as Severo, with a solid legato and a well-equalized voice, interesting and supported by solid acting. Matthew Rose as Callistene makes a suitable villain. Enrique Mazzola builds this great score with authority without hampering his singers. If you like Donizetti, this set should please you. The production is, of course, updated to some vaguely 20-th century setting, with walls that roll in and out of place; this was slightly annoying to me until in Act 2, just as I was about to heave another sigh, I realized the director was forcing us to see the trio that emerges *as a trio* amid the massive finale. Donizetti's melodic gifts are near their apex here, and the production serves them well. Incidentally, the DVD version is all regions--I purchased it accidentally thinking I'd ordered the Blu-ray. If the Blu-ray, as Amazon tells us, is really not playable in North America, that would be surprising.",1473811200,4,1703,5.311111111111111
8761456,5,B01FSGKK78,"I highly recommend this production of a rarely performed masterpiece. I became familiar with the music of Poliuto with the 1960's recording with Corelli and Callas, which was dream casting in its day. I am not bothered by the updating of the production to imply Bolshevik or Nazi oppression. It has been said that in the 20th century more Christians were put to death for their faith than in the waves of Roman persecution during the first three centuries after Christ. In totalitarian regimes of whatever stripe, the dynamic is the same, and the 19th century libretto of a 3rd century martyr works in a 20th century setting. The abstract moving sets make it possible for the story to continue without lengthy set changes. Michael Fabiano and Ana Maria Martinez are not Corelli and Callas, but they are among the best singing actors on the operatic stage today. They and the rest of the musical forces are first rate, and their collective rendition of this neglected Donizetti masterpiece is to be treasured and enjoyed. For all of these reasons, I give it 5 stars.",1471824000,4,1065,4.793478260869565
8761457,3,B01FSGKK78,"Three stars for the very good singers only, cero for the production. It is a pity that such a beautiful opera was so stupidly desacralized and mutilated by Glyndebourne. To me Poliuto is high above Lucia, Anna Bolena and Maria Stuarda in all respects.
The music makes no sense in the awful atmosphere of this production, the continuing rolling walls, a wheelchair, modern  garments, German Nazi overtones, people running so much. There was no need to spit on a cross, although in fact this is the only moment reminding one that this opera takes during early Christianity. Marianne Clment, the French producer states in the interview that she did not want realistic sets, as if that were her prerogatives. Donizetti, who wrote the opera wanted realistic sets and she and nobody today should dare change that to satisfy their sick egos. My recomendation is to continue
listening to Callas, Corelli and Bastianini pirated recordings and forget about this lousy production.",1471651200,12,969,5.05625
8761458,3,B01FSGKK78,"This little known opera by Donizetti is surprisingly beautiful and is admirably staged, played and sung by the Glyndebourne team. The bluray image and the soundtrack are excellent, and Opus Arte would doubtless earn five stars for this addition to its first-rate opera catalogue, had they not, for niggardly savings, left out the Italian subtitles. I am sure that not even all Italians can follow opera singing without the assistance of a printed text, and for a foreigner like me this is almost impossible. And yet there are many opera lovers all over the world who know enough of Donizetti's (and da Ponte's!!) language to benefit greatly from Italian subtitles. I am deducting two stars to emphasize the seriousness of this easily remedied fault. Omitting original language subtitles when you can afford Korean and Japanese is both stingy and inconsiderate.",1469750400,6,860,5.15
