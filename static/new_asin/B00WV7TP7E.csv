8714449,5,B00WV7TP7E,"This is an excellent, non-vulgar family movie you can watch with the kids!  My 10 year old daughter (and mom and dad) LOVED it!  Benny (the dog) is adorable too!  And the human values of empathy and compassion are represented well too.  I am very pleased to see that some companies are still making 'family friendly' films that I can watch with my child.",1444694400,,354,4.484375
8714450,3,B00WV7TP7E,"For the parent or grandparent who is looking for a completely benign movie for young children, stop right here.  This is a cute little film with no violence, no vulgarity and no traumatic or scary scenes or moments, and it teaches (without being 'preachy') positive values, mercy, self-worth and that actions (both good and bad) have consequences.

Adults might not be as enamoured by the film as young children are sure to be--it does move along at a rather slow pace and is obviously produced on a shoestring.  In particular, the owner of the pet shop seems to be better suited to voiceover work than acting as he morphs his voice and persona from scene to scene and never really falls into a single, solid character.  Plus, in a few scenes it's obvious everyone on camera is reading off a cue card or teleprompter.

The solid, positive value of the story more than makes up for the acting and production deficiencies, though, and I'd rather have my kid watching this movie over-and-over than a more slicked-up production with objectionable content.",1444176000,,1051,4.816666666666666

8714452,5,B00WV7TP7E,"This is a very sweet, innocent little movie for families with kids, or just for kids to watch.  I bought it for my daughter who's a young teen and she liked it.  I love shows like these, because the drama factor is low, there aren't any negative things about it.  While it wouldn't be something I'd want to watch with hubby unless she was there too, it was definitely a sweet family movie to enjoy.  There were no closed captions or subtitles on our disk, which would've been nice for us with less than perfect hearing, but it was still very good.",1436572800,,547,4.333333333333333
