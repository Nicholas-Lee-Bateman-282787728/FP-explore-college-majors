8108414,4,B000EDGPPC,"A collection of some of the most obscure and classic films trailers that have ever been put on screen. it includes horror film (i.e. Basket Case), gore movies (i.e. Flesh Feast), early nudies (i.e. Nude on the Moon) and showcases the works of such icons as Hershel Gordon Lewis, Betty Page and Chesty Morgan.",1397952000,,308,4.722222222222222
8108415,5,B000EDGPPC,"I am a bit of connaisseur when it comes to stuff like this. If you want a tantamount of odd trailers to fuel your convo fodder, this little knick knack is for you. The variety and depravity of its content is enough to satisfy the odd in oneself. If you like collecting, seeing a bit of cinema history or looking for a different kind of movie, you won't go wrong with this.",1370304000,2,372,4.180555555555555
8108416,4,B000EDGPPC,"Originally given away at Borders bookstores, this sampler of what Something Weird Video has to offer will either repulse you or make you start buying their products. I'm in the latter camp, though I prefer more of the horror, 50's high school, and hippie fare and less of the T&A flicks (but I'm not judging). But if you're going into it thinking that everything listed on the back is a trailer, be forewarned; a number of them are just a brief scene from the film, including 'Scum Of The Earth,' 'The Gore Gore Girls,' and 'Horrors Of Spider Island.' Others, that were the second or third film of a double- or triple-feature DVD, are listed on the back but aren't represented on the disc. Some highlights that aren't trailers are Meg Myles belting out ""More Deadly Than The Male"" from 'Satan In High Heels,' and seeing just how ridiculous the 'Godmonster Of Indian Flats' looks.  All in all, if you're looking to discover the wild world of Something Weird, this is the best place to start.",1357776000,6,990,4.625
