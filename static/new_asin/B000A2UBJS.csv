8072643,4,B000A2UBJS,"it is only a matter of time before the newest dance phenomenon krump hits the mainstream.  it's have received screen time in one of those 'bring it on and the temple of ashkaban' movies, and it is a plot element in 'stomp the yard'.

it is required to see the form, raw and uncultured and beautiful, in documentaries like 'breakin/krumpin'"".  that way you can see it as real as the dvd viewing experience can make it AND see the beginnings of its commodification.",1209081600,,463,4.554216867469879
8072644,4,B000A2UBJS,"This is what street dancing is all about. Not on style but more the energy that is pushed out of it. I liked it because I was once a B-boy in my youger days and started doing the new wave of dancing ""Krumpin."" For those that like street dancing will like this video. The battle of the old and new street dancing era. The best of the best street dancing at it's best.",1200700800,,366,4.027397260273973
8072645,5,B000A2UBJS,"If your into the KRUMP movement, all of the dvds in this series are a must have",1184544000,,79,3.7058823529411766
8072646,3,B000A2UBJS,"This DVD revolves around the old-skool dance style of Breakin (Or BBoying/Breakdancing) against a new upcoming dance style called Krumpin.

The storyline is rather mediocre, with two people making a bet as to which dance style would beat the other. The content however, goes rather in depth into the current image of the dance styles.

As you watch this film, you will learn the basic roots of Krumpin and Breakin, and how the battle styles differ and such. Well known Bboys such as Crumbs and Reun represent the Bboy team, and Krumpin founder Tight Eyez leads the Krumpin team.

Much of the film itself is based on the preparation to the battle, and how both teams look for crew members to join the battle.

The battle itself has lots of energy, with some mind blowing moves from both sides. However the difference in music and battle style made the battle hard to judge from an audiences point of view. If you only wish to buy the DVD just to find the outcome of the battle, I would not reccomend. You're better off finding out the verdict from another source since the battle is only a small portion of the DVD.

Note to BBoys/Bgirls: The international scene for BBoyin/Bgirlin is not represented well in this video. Do not expect appearances from any bboy outside of the US.",1175299200,,1278,4.6371681415929205
8072647,4,B000A2UBJS,"Maybe I am not being fair because I saw this on digital cable and not shell out any dough...

I grew up with hiphop, and in its hey day it was innovative, exciting new and fresh..

but its NOT hungry.....its rehashed and looks no different than a street version of organized gymnastics. any high school cheerleader can be a break dancer now.......but lets see them krump...

I was amazed at the raw energy and freshness of krump...those that think krumping is not an artform are just part of the spiritually retarded crowd.

I was more blown away by the reaction of the breakdancer, how they got so caught up in the energy of the crump dancers they lost their cool....

it was at that point, I realized breakdancing is really played out!!!

and Krumping is dancing you can feel, though most likely not for the spiritually retarded!!",1159747200,2,832,4.625850340136054
8072648,5,B000A2UBJS,"I am 45 years old. I grew up with shabadoo and Todd Bridges. I know both of them. I knew they would be opened minded enought and fair enough to call the battle. They both concluded the same as I did, that it was a tie. Krump is hear to stay, and breakin is too..my only complaint was that Shabadoo could have put more poppers or Lockers ...now that would have really been unfair. the guy in the red suite was a okay popper...but lets see the youngsters go up against mr wiggles and the electric boogaloo....oh that would have made me cry..because I would feel bad for not knowing enough to judge krumpin fairly.. I go by the crowds enthusiam..and they get the crowd going. I am going to learn to krump at my old age..cause dancing is my life..Long beach late 70's and we street danced..oh yeah...long live Pete, Sam, Marvin, decky, skally, robot dane,skeeter Rabbitt, creepin Sid, the boogaloo bandit, elmo, david Nelms, and many other street dancers who loved the excitment of the crowd.",1156464000,7,988,4.556179775280899
8072649,3,B000A2UBJS,"I have to agree with another review who stated that the biggest issue with this DVD is the narration and the judging in the ""Battle"".  Unlike the documentary on Krumping called ""Rize"", which many viewers will have seen and probably led you to this film, the dance battle in this DVD has a poor venue (a small garage with no more than 30 or so spectators, most of whom look like they've never heard of Krumping and are definitely NOT from the streets) versus the Great Western Forum packed with 10,000 urban dance fans in ""Rize"".

At the end of the movie Shabba-Doo calls it a tie, which is a complete joke and ruins the whole movie.  After watching the battle it's obvious that the raw unchoreographed energy of the Krumpers outshines the ho-hum highly-practised and passion-less breaking moves of the breakers.  It's like watching a battle between a group of Warriors (Krumpers) against some effeminate Ballerinas (Breakers).  At the end of all of that to call a ""Tie"" is a complete cop-out.",1138060800,6,992,4.710982658959537
