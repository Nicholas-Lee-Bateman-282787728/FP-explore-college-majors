2632623,5,B000HAWI7Q,"I was in SAC from 1959 until 1962 and this DVD brought back great memories.  When I arrived at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, we had the B-47s and our refueling tankers were propeller driven KC-95s until we switched to the KC-135 (military version of the Boeing 707.  HIghly recommend this DVD to USAF buffs as well as anyone interested in military history.",1368144000,4,348,4.688524590163935
2632624,4,B000HAWI7Q,"Used to be a SAC missileer in the early 1980s at Malmstrom AFB, so it brought back memories of those days.  I miss SAC, its toughness and what it represented.  The logo with the fist, lightning bolts, and olive branch says it all.  Great documentary.",1367539200,4,250,4.511111111111111
2632625,5,B000HAWI7Q,My husband was part of SAC and has really enjoyed this video.  Excellent buy for those who were part of it or those who just want to know more.,1357430400,10,143,3.9310344827586206
2632626,4,B000HAWI7Q,"This is a no-frills (a single DVD in a flat card sleeve) presentation of a History Channel program from the 'Modern Marvels' series. It outlines the birth, heyday and winding up of the Strategic Air Command - at one time in charge of the entire air-borne and missile component of the US nuclear deterrant. While in no way pretending to be a definitive account of the organization, it is a very watchable account of the SAC's history and the reasons for its existance. With a rather frank and forthright style, and lots of interviews and archive footage of nuclear tests and strategic bombers, it is a good introduction to how the US reacted to the cold war, although a collected set of the entire series would have been better.",1302566400,21,727,4.6434108527131785

8137934,4,B000HAWI7Q,"ended up with this instead of the Strategic Air Command MOVIE I thought I was buying, but enjoyed it anyway.  Always like documentaries, and especially well done ones, which this is.",1477353600,,182,4.870967741935484
8137935,5,B000HAWI7Q,"Anything SAC is worth a watch. This documentary is a must for any prior AF SAC Airman. No other command holds a candle to SAC, the B-52, the KC-135 and all the alert force tours that came with it.",1457568000,,196,4.051282051282051

8137939,4,B000HAWI7Q,Good show. But not what I wanted. But kept end for my library. I had seen it last year and I'm not able to remember the show.  Thank you for the show anyway.  It had shown the start of the Air  Force.,1386288000,,200,3.7142857142857144
8137940,2,B000HAWI7Q,"The DVD was listed under Strategic Air Command as if it were the Jimmy Stewart movie, but in fact it was a history of SAC. The DVD wasn't that good. I wasted my time and money.",1386028800,,176,3.9166666666666665
8137941,3,B000HAWI7Q,It was just a copy of a DVD and not very high quality product which I had expected from Amazon,1380672000,,94,3.75
