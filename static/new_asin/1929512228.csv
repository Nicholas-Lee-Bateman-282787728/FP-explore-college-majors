7801278,5,1929512228,"I just got interested in tatting and after searching websites and YouTube, I decided to just get the dvd so I'd have everything in one place. I'm so glad I did. This woman is as boring as watching paint dry but her explanations, directions, and examples are excellent. Everything you need to know to get started is right here. Have fun tat tat tat tatting along!",1317427200,,362,4.5
7801279,4,1929512228,"The narrative is a little dry, but really, how can you make instructional videos of this sort highly entertaining? This lady explains things quite well, and I'd recommend this to anyone starting tatting, as well as some of the YouTube videos out there for free. The ladies who give their time to show us how to do this craft ROCK!",1311206400,,330,4.516666666666667
7801280,5,1929512228,"I have the VHS version of this video and bought this DVD for my daughter whom I've been teaching to tat.  I learned to tat from my Grandmother and had been tatting for years, but when I saw this video years ago I bought it.  It has been wonderfully helpful.  I've learned several things I did not know how to do.  The instructions are clear and the close-ups of the techniques are very, very good.  She includes several less common techniques seen in newer and older tatting patterns.  The nice thing is being able to go over and over and over something you might be stuck on.  I highly recommend this video.",1230422400,2,608,4.375
7801281,5,1929512228,"I learned how to do the basic tatting stitches from a video I checked out from the library, but the library didn't have anything beyond the basics. I found some tatting patterns online and tried to figure things out on my own with no luck. This tatted lace from start to finishing video has been so incredibly helpful to me. It's managed to answer all the questions I've had about tatting. I also like Bev's teaching style. It reminds me of how my great grandmother used to teach me things. Very soft spoken and calm. I find it comforting when I'm trying to figure out something new. :-)",1197504000,3,587,4.444444444444445
7801282,5,1929512228,"My sister taught be the basic double-stitch and making a picot, but I knew nothing else.  This video has VERY CLEAR, up-close video of how to make picots, join picots, make chains, and add in new bobbin thread without tying. Then it goes on to more advanced techniques like split rings, adding beads, etc., but I haven't progressed to that point yet.  By the way, if you're a total newbie like me, the book ""Easy Tatting"" by Linden is also very good, although I wish it had more patterns.

Happy tatting...but beware...it's highly addicting!",1115683200,13,541,4.73404255319149
