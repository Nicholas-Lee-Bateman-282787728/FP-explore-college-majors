2041752,5,B0001XAODO,"Just when I thought that reality shows couldn't get any more ridiculous, out of the blue comes the Joe Schmo Show.
I always thought that there were too many of these bloody shows anyway, and I think that the networks really need to cut it out.  There are only a few exceptions that are actually any good, and those are the ones that should remain.
My hatred of the reality genre basically stems from the fact that most networks think that they can just prepackage a show without hiring any professional actors or anything like that, they don't have to hire writers to actually use their brains or things of that nature, and that was just plain sloppy.
Then the 'Joe Schmo Show' came around, a reality show that only ONE person thinks is real.  The premise of the show reminded me of 'The Truman Show' starring Jim Carrey, sort of.
I thought that this show was truly, TRULY excellent.  Because this show simultaneously paid homage and poked fun at the reality genre.  And even though there were writers on the show and actors, there were still moments of unpredictability on the part of Matt that would surprise everyone; the cast, the crew, and the audience watching.
I think what I liked best thing about the show was the fact that Matt Kennedy Gould was such an incredible human being.  He was someone that you can't help but like.  He's definitely the kind of person you want to have as a best friend, or a brother, or if you're a girl you definitely want to date or even marry the guy.
This show is definitely awesome, and I can't wait to see what they'll do for an encore with 'Joe Schmo 2'.",1087171200,9,1596,4.448630136986301
2041753,5,B0001XAODO,This is not one of the best shows on TV.  It is the BEST SHOW EVER.  This show is great.  The funniest series of all time.  I couldn't stop laughing.,1086739200,4,149,3.8666666666666667
2041754,5,B0001XAODO,"I LOVED this show.  It was one of the best on television!  I laughed hysterically at every show.  If you at all enjoy reality shows, this is a must see.  I'm looking forward to buying it!",1086307200,2,187,4.111111111111111
2041755,5,B0001XAODO,"The premise: It's a reality show that isn't real. Matt Kennedy Gould thinks that he's on a reality show called,""Lap of Luxury,"" playing for $100k. But what he doesn't know is that everyone else is an actor and it's one big trick.
This show is hilarious. It is also sometimes touching or surprising. It's my favorite reality show. Many people I know who hate reality show love this show. I think I know why:
Most reality shows are fake, but not completely fake. It's hard to manipulate it to be a good show. In this show the whole premise is that it's fake, so the writers can do whatever they want to make the show funny/shocking/touching/other with still a little bit of riskiness and surprise when Matt doesn't act like the writers thought he would, or the actors slip up.
If I were to have a problem with this show, occaisonally it becomes obvious that this was on Spike TV, the network for men. The women are all hot and in bikinis. I don't mind (I'm a girl), but some other people do. That's the problem with Spike TV-it's all sexist and macho and I feel like I should be all angry at it, but I can't be because it's so fun and funny to watch!",1085961600,9,1148,4.319444444444445

2041803,5,B0001XAODO,"A brilliant send-up of reality TV.  It is amazing how 10+ years later reality shows still follow the same format that Joe Schmo made fun of so well.  If you watched it when the show originally aired, it is as funny as you remember it.  If you have never seen the show, order the DVD and be prepared.  It's fun to see Kristen Wiig in an early role too!",1416873600,,351,4.043478260869565

2041805,5,B0001XAODO,"I loved the first season of Joe Schmo Show. I've seen all 3 and the first was by far the best. The characters are memorable, but still believable. I originally watched this as a teenager on Spike and it stuck with me all these years. I ordered the DVD set so I could rewatch it with my girlfriend who is into all these new reality shows. It was just as good on the second viewing and doesn't seem very outdated.",1409788800,,411,4.15

2041807,5,B0001XAODO,"I've watched a lot of reality tv and this show is excellent for so many reasons!  The Joe Schmo seems to be a legitimately great guy! You'll notice some comedic actors that got this gig before going on to much bigger things (Kristen Wiig). The show is relatively thoughtful, very funny, and incredibly entertaining!  I recommend it to everyone who enjoys good television and even those who dismiss reality tv as silly - a very funny show that can be enjoyed by so many people!!

The special features on the dvd are great.  It was made way before the time where High Definition was standard so you'll have to expect lower picture quality.  I can honestly say this show is hilarious and can really be enjoyed on a lot of different levels!!

Go Joe Schmo!

P.S. seasons 2 and 3 are great as well but the first season is the bee's knees (best)!!!",1403740800,,842,4.4640522875816995

2041829,1,B0001XAODO,This is not what it says it is.  It is season 3.  Season one aired several years ago with Kristen Wiig and is much funnier.  This season is not worth $17.00.,1367539200,2,157,4.0
2041830,4,B0001XAODO,"This was the first Joe Schmo where the producers moved away from the cruel dating theme to something a little different.  However, it limits the comedy factor a bit when the target (Joe Schmo) is constantly praised and wins every challenge - every twist helps Schmo in some way.  The target was very likable, however, and there were some hilarious parts in the show (Lorenzo Lamas!) but I think season 2 was much funnier.  This was thoroughly entertaining, though.",1366502400,,464,4.848101265822785
2041831,5,B0001XAODO,"The Joe Schmo Show continues to be the very best fake ""reality"" show on television.  It is always entertaining as it spoofs all the other bad reality TV by setting up one unsuspecting schmo in a series of loony and hilarious scenarios.  If you only watch one fake ""reality"" TV shows, this is the one to not miss.",1365552000,,312,4.362068965517241
2041832,4,B0001XAODO,"but as the season goes on and they continue to try to push the limits I found myself asking ""why""?  I'm all for going overboard for humor but it doesn't always seem to be for that reason.  Overall it was a great idea and the first few episodes are hilarious.  It's hard to create a show when one of the characters (the star) is completely oblivious.",1364515200,,349,4.257575757575758

2041844,4,B0001XAODO,"Okay, I am a gigantic fan of the short lived VH1 show 'Free Radio' starring Lance Krall, god hope that eventually gets released on DVD. So I picked this up because Lance Krall is in season one as Kip, the gay guy, and really enjoyed the show overall, mainly because Krall is hilarious and I think carries it, however, was a huge pleasant surprise to see Rickity Cricket from 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia' (can't remember the actor's name) is also one of the characters in season one, and is awesome as well.",1363046400,,513,4.526881720430108
2041845,5,B0001XAODO,This was an excellent video.  My cable channel was not working the night the finale was shown.  I decided that I would try and find it online and was led to the Amazon instant viewing.  The price was reasonable at $1.99 so I decided to try it.  The quality of the video was excellent.  I had no problems whatsoever.  Audio was very good also.  It was a great way to catch a show that you have missed with little cost.  Thank you Amazon for your instant viewing!,1362873600,,461,4.218390804597701

2041847,5,B0001XAODO,"LOVE THIS SHOW !!!!
Usually DVR and watch, but forgot to set my recorder for episode 9, so I was glad to see Amazon carried the Season 3 episodes
The concept of this show is genius. The creators and production team are constantly having to change the script while the actors have to improvise constantly to keep the game going. It's so fun to watch.  Highly recommend for everybody",1362182400,,381,4.521739130434782
2041848,4,B0001XAODO,"Ok I really dislike reality shows..just because...but this show captured my attention immediately.

2041852,5,B0001XAODO,"I loved every whacky moment of this darling show.
This has got to be the silliest, smartest parody on ""reality"" type shows that has been produced. Everything that goes into making a great production is in this series.
The writing, (much of which had to have been added once filming was done), is clever and on target every episode.
The cast of characters is right on point and could have been plucked from any number of ""reality"" shows. But what brought them to the point of brilliance is the creative acting of the cast. Literally  a laugh a minute. I wonder how the actors managed to keep straight faces.....most of the time. The asides to the viewer serve as extra ticklers to the funny bone. OMG! Whoever thought up ""The man pouch""? ..... Or the ventriloquist dummy who is a dead ringer for ....well.....I can't give it all away. Hilarious!
The set is bawdy, outrageous and tacky to the extreme. Just the ticket for a show that is also all of those things.
The crew of writers and producers make appearances during the show to bring the viewer into the joke by commenting on what is happening In the moment. The viewer quickly buys into the need to keep the ""Shmo"" from figuring out that it's all a huge ""put-on"". Can they make it to the final episode without him realizing what's really going on?
Anyone who has ever watched an episode of any one of the ""Survivor"" series will immediately recognize the elimination ceremony. . . taken to the extreme. Then there's Chase (poor Chase) who is taking all the shenanigans with the utmost seriousness. He desperately wants to win. Throughout each episode, he appears on camera to share his take on the ""competition"" . His commentary on events is made ever more hilarious because he is the only one who is not in on the joke. Chase has to be one of the sweetest, gentle hearted, good natured innocents on planet earth. How could he not figure it out? As a viewer, I cannot help but wonder if he isn't just too good. If the whole Thing isn't just one huge joke on the viewer? Hmmmm....if it is, it's one darned funny joke.",1360368000,,2069,4.517333333333333

2041857,5,B0001XAODO,"I really enjoy the Joe Schmo show. The whole premise of the show, really intriqued me from the get-go and the acting and set up kept me interested. It's really interesting to hear actors talk out of character about their preformences, it makes it audiences identify better, with these people and enjoy the show. The Schmo Matt, is a really cool guy to watch and it's very amusing to see him try his heart out on a show that is rigged.

The games and elimination ceramony were pretty well done, minus one episode where (SPOILER) two people were eliminated, where the two people with the highest amounts of votes were sent away. I feel they should've voted twice.

Surprisingly the ""host"" of the show captivated my interest and helped carry the show in some areas (the sign of a good host). Also the inclushion of Jerri and the fake tv exceutive were interesting as it helped bring in different more level personalities and not close to over the top acting. However as one who eventually liked Jerri after her third Survivor season, I'm kind of annoyed that the producers made Jerri oveerplay her ""bitch"" card and then give one contestant a high score dispite her saying (in character) ""Out of all the suckyness that sucked the least"".

The ending and the reflection chapter, was actually very entertaining to watch bringing the show to a much better conclusion. All in all a great season to view and if this review didn't do it justice, read the other ones.",1356912000,,1456,4.657587548638133

No need to order this one faster than others, it is censored just with pixels and not cuts. So all those ""Did I see what I thought I saw?"" moments on Spike TV are still hidden.

To see the reaction of the only person who is not in on the joke is great.  Matt Kennedy Gould is the ""Joe"", and when he finally finds out he is the butt of the joke, he is a great sport about it.  Some of the extreme things that this show does pushes the envelope of what some other try and achieve on TV.

And, creators Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick should be commended for discovering Kristin Wiig, who played the doctor.  Before Joe Schmo, she was a nobody.  Now she's in 3-4 films each year and stars on Saturday Nite Live as the most-written-for cast member....And the guy who plays Rickety Cricket in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia plays the asshole, Hutch.  Nice job guys......Very creative of you...",1251158400,,526,4.865168539325842

This season has the perfect ""Schmo"" and I would recommend it highly. However, I would avoid season 2. This was difficult to recreate and adapt to the two ""Schmo's"" in the follow-up attempt.

2041878,5,B0001XAODO,"I loved this series the first time I saw it but, regrettably, never managed to really catch all of the episodes.  When I saw this collection, I didn't hesitate to purchase immediately.  There has never been another show like this, nor will there ever likely be again.  My boyfriend and it got so into it that after we sat down to watch the first show, we laughed so much that we didn't stop watching until we had viewed ALL of the episodes.  If I remember correctly, there are about 7-8 episodes and we were up past 3 am laughing until our sides split.  This is the type of thing you will watch again and also loan out to your friends to watch because it is just a one of a kind.  There's an extra clip at the end, where ""Joe"" sits and reflects on the show as well.  You will fall in love with him, his ""character"" is unfogettable and a rare find in today's world.",1219795200,,864,4.168674698795181
2041879,5,B0001XAODO,"This show is great - a hybrid of candid camera and reality television, the show is only made spectacular because of how great ""Joe Schmo"" really is.  Matt is just an all around great guy and without him in the center of everything, this just would not be as funny or enjoyable as it is.

Contrary to what others seem to have said in reviews, this version is ""uncensored"" - the only time you see the mosaic are when it was intentionally done for humorous purposes and not for censor purposes (ie. when Kip is obviously wearing a nude colored undie on the catwalk... the mosaic is left in ""covering"" his naughty bits, because obviously it wouldn't have been as funny to see him walk down in nude underoos. Also they do blur out Molly's supposed nipple slip, but it's difficult to tell if anything was actually seen anyway.)

In any case.  This is a pretty basic set for the first season but it's so much better without commercials!",1212969600,,929,4.479289940828402
2041880,5,B0001XAODO,"Simple...The first season of Joe Schmo in my opinion is the only true REALITY show .... ever. The season finale' will go down in history.

Not a dry eye in the house. If you like reality television you'll love The Joe Schmo Show season one. Gary Bruner",1172188800,3,252,4.361702127659575
2041881,4,B0001XAODO,"When this show aired I loved it, it was so hilarious and new. The concept was awesome and really got the audience emotionally invested in Matt's experience and the ultimate reveal that it was all fake. Kind of like the Truman show remake. In total there are 7 episodes, the 8th episode was more of a recap followed by the last ten minutes being the reveal. After that the rest of the episode is an interview with Matt and his experience which was cool.

My only complaint was that the season was so short, it only lasted 7 episodes, wish it was longer but the DVD was so entertaining and it was worth every scent. Can't wait for the season two DVD to come out ""Last chance for love""",1170892800,,682,4.286821705426356

2041883,5,B0001XAODO,"This was one of the first TV to DVD sets I rented from my online rental service, and it certainly was worth every penny.  I highly recommend its purchase to anyone who enjoys to ""love"" or ""hate"" reality programs.

We all love to be voyeurs, and in this show, you are the ultimate voyeur, as are the reset of the cast and crew, in this kooky, ""fly on the wall"" presentation.  Ever wonder what goes through the minds of those people who respond to those online scams?  Well, this ""yokel"" is one of them.  And it goes to show, anyone, nice or greedy, could fall for the ""lap of luxury"" premise, the producers give us.

Joe is such a loveable guy.  I like how we get to see his family, and life at home.  Getting to know him, makes us feel less guilty about what is going to happen to him very soon.  Then, its easy to laugh at him.  But at the end, he's just so loveable, and understanding, and you feel good again.

High recommended.

2041894,5,B0001XAODO,"When this show aired in the Fall of 2003 I was totally there every week. Truly inventive in the sea of ""reality"" shows, this one poked fun at all of them. Having one real person in the midst of a cast of loonies was quite simply, brilliant. This show definitely offers one of the best casts of actors assembled in awhile, and they all perform wonderfully in their assigned ""reality"" roles. From the ""Rich Bitch,"" to the ""Gay Guy"" (Kip, who is hilarious and more sweet than offensive--thankfully), to the crusty military Veteran, the actors continuously provide hilarity with their take on cliched reality show contestants and situations.

The one character that stands out most is the Real World III inspired, Puck wannabe ""The Hutch"" who picks his nose, burps at the table, doesn't shower, and ""tells it like it is."" He delivers some of the best lines, including one on how he ""respected"" another cast member. However, the real star of this piece is a real, nice guy by the name of Matt Kennedy Gould. The creators, once again, struck gold in their casting. Always trying to do the right thing, he offers sometimes touching moments that are quite surprising for such a silly, sometimes raunchy show. His reaction upon learning the truth provides the biggest of these moments and wonderfully closes the show with some class.

Even if you aren't a ""reality"" show type of person (such as myself) I do believe you'll get a good time out of the show. I personally have only watched The Real World 1-3 (before it turned into softcore porn), and parts of other shows (like Fear Factor), and I got what was being ripped on here. Sadly, there aren't too many extras--a full commentary from the entire cast would have been something, as would additional commentary from Matt, along with more footage of what the actors were doing while Matt wasn't there, but the show itself is worth viewing. Some have commented on the censorship and sadly it is in some places, but there was one part that needed to be. According to a now gone tv database website, the character of Kip was not actually naked during one of the games. This show was re-aired under the name ""Mo'Joe Schmo"" (why wasn't that included?), where there was pop-up text pieces written by Matt where he revealed that Kip was wearing something, so they covered him with the pixels to give the impression he was actually naked. I hope things like this don't detour you from viewing this excellent show, as you can hear and see what's censored in other entertainment (Is it really that hard to see nudity?). The stuff surrounding is what really matters--and it's pretty damn good.",1128556800,7,2626,4.718954248366013
2041895,3,B0001XAODO,"well, i love joe schmo, one of the few shows i waited for as the week passed. the hutch is indeed the greatest character ever, followed very closely by bryce the stalker from season 2, but thats beside the point i'm going to make here. this is highlighted for the fact that its uncensored, but it is, indeed, censored. not all of it, the models aren't cencored no, there is full unbleeped language (except for the bonus material, which still bleeps, even as they say it doesnt right on the case). one thing i was craving, was molly's bikini top slippage, to see her great, beautiful breast. but nope, blurred.  Hutch's prank on kip's photo-album, still blurred. see, i am disappointed not because i don't get to see hutch's or brians ass, but because i wanted complete reality, and they promised no censoring. that is my complaint. still, its joe schmo. i hope next season they don't lie to us again.",1092268800,13,900,4.590062111801243

I would never have tuned into this show if I hadn't read about it, and I'm so glad I did!  It is the funniest show that has ever been on television!  I think it's fantastic and it gives such an insight on these reality shows and how they work.
I myself am a big fan of reality shows, so I was able to see all the jokes and parodies of other reality shows, and I just died laughing at all of the little in-jokes.
For all of you who are wary of the reality band wagon and don't appreciate this new genre, I highly recommend the Joe Schmo, for its interesting take and gentle satire!  What a classic!",1090022400,11,731,4.126760563380282
2041897,5,B0001XAODO,"I started watching season 2 and missed out on season one.  I think that the show is very clever and keeps me laughing.  Season one is by far better.  I love the characters,especially Matt, who is not even a character.  Now I just want to be his friend.  This is a great buy but it is a little pricey.  Forty dollars is a little too expensive.
I think the premise of the show is good and well thought up.  Kip the gay guy is by far the funniest and does the best acting job.  Ashleigh the rich Snob is hot as all and does a great job as well.
I would recommend you buy this right now because it is hours of entertainment joking the reality shows we love",1090022400,6,652,4.0
2041898,4,B0001XAODO,"When this show first aired, I was HOOKED! And now that I own the first season on DVD, I'm reminded of why I got hooked.
As for my review of the DVD, I have few gripes, and plenty of praise!
The luxury of seeing the show in DVD quality is of course a plus. And I like that they included the ""Coming up next"" sections that came right before a commercial break (No, no commercials during the episodes here, thankfully)
The audio commentary on disk 3 (the finale) is hilarious, as are most of the uncensored deleted scenes. And not that *I* personally needed to see how they created the *ahem* ""food"" that Matt was challenged to eat during the ""The Meal"" challenge, it was still funny to see the behind-the-scenes of that stunt.
There's also some additional ""eviction"" footage, but it's more of like ""now-I'm-out-of-character-and-commenting-about-Matt"" footage. Which isn't a bad thing really, since you DO get to see how different the actors are from their characters.
The ""chocolate sauce on models"" extended sequence is not as hot as it might sound. The models are already covered in chocolate when the sequence begins, so no bare bodies are to be found. But if you like low level bi fun, or just want to see what three chocolate covered models look like in DVD quality, check it out.
One gripe, which is actually more of clarification really, is that the show is not actually shown ""uncensored."" Unbleeped, definitely! I know that some of the guys (and maybe some girls) want to get this DVD set because they want to see Molly's pool ""fall out"" and see some model nippage (I know this, because it's one of the first questions I've been asked when fellow fans hear I have the DVD set) Well, if that's your main reason for getting this DVD set, let me save you $40 and let you know it ain't gonna be in this set. Yes, the wet t-shirt challenge IS unblurred, so if you want to spend the bucks for THAT, then go have at it.
(Personally, if THAT'S your bag, it would seem to be a better investment to use that same $40 and get a full on, triple X,  stroke-til-you-choke, porno!)
And my only other gripe, is that for 3 disks and just a handful of extras, buyers may feel they didn't get their $40 worth. Personally, I would have walked away happy if it had been around $10 cheaper.
That's My Opinion, But You're Welcome To It",1089849600,77,2319,4.4822695035460995
2041899,5,B0001XAODO,"That's from Matt when he saw Tawny Roberts when doing the commentary for the uncensored finale. Just one of many funny things on a very funny DVD.
First, you'll get to watch all the episodes without logos, commercials, promos over the closing credits or other such nonsense. This is great in itself and even if you've been a regular watcher of the show (maybe more than once), I think you'll still laugh. For more fun, try using your DVD's pause / slow motion feature during the director's meetings to pick up things you might not have noticed before.
The special features are pretty sweet. One of the best ones is what I mentioned above - a commentary on the finale by Matt Kennedy Gould and executive producer Rhett Reese. Since the finale also includes a look-back at the entire season, you'll get to hear their thoughts on that as well. You'll also catch up on how Matt's doing now and some of his deepest thoughts on what during the show.
As for the actual bonus features section, you get Deleted Scenes, Chocolate-Covered Models featurette, the Making of a Meal and additional Eviction footage. Of these, I'd have to say that the most interesting and revealing is definitely the Eviction footage. You get the complete commentary of what the cast had to say to Matt after they were ""evicted,"" plus Matt's full commentary afterwards. You'll recognize the bits and pieces that were shown during the program, but this is the chance to see the entire thing and pick up a lot of stuff that got cut before. Of the Deleted Scenes, the two funniest are Matt's Breakdown and a Fish Story from Kip. The breakdown is very funny and almost alone makes the DVD worth it.
Finally, to those who are complaining about the censorship, I just have to say that I don't think it's any big deal. For one thing, when they censored Brian's nipples, that was a joke. And, come on, do you really want to see Brian's naughty bits anyway? Or Kip's? If that's the only thing you're tuning in for, then it seems you're not appreciating everything the show/DVD has to offer. Oh, and by way of explanation, the main cast of the show probably had contracts that said they couldn't show that --- at least for the stuff that wasn't just a joke.",1089504000,13,2215,4.581863979848866

Marked by epic moments like Hutch throwing his ceremonial plate into the fireplace, Matt struggling to like chocolate off of a supermodel's rack, and the dramatic final eviction ceremony.  This is truly another great reality show worthy of having its own DVD.  If you missed it, buy it.  If you enjoyed and and want to relive its glory, buy it.  If you didn't like it or you're one of those people who think reality shows don't deserve to be on DVD, screw it, you're probably too much of a numskull to read this review anyway.
Bottom line: great show with loads of fun.  If you're on the fence about buying this DVD, buy it, and for the love of god watch the second season which is turning out, somehow, to be even better than the first.",1088985600,,853,4.5064935064935066

When the DVD came out saying uncensored I went and bought it expecting everything to be shown and every word to be said. Well every word is said but everything is not shown. Is it just me or is that false advertising or what? I would have also like to have seen more bonus features but even though I still give the DVD 5 stars because the show itself is fun to watch. The 2nd season is on right now and to me it looks even better then the first one. Can't wait till it is on DVD and I hope the don't lie this time about the uncensored version.

I'll admit it.  I love this show and think it's hilarious.
I'll admit it.  I cried when saw the montage of Matt clips at the end of the series as they talk about what a great guy he is.
First, this series is a guilty pleasure because it is at times a little racy and raunchy, and I could do without much of that stuff.  I've DVRed all the episodes during the recent Schmo-Out Marathon...and I won't buy the uncensored DVD because of the language and nudity and other junk.
Ok...confession over...on to the merits...
This show is the result of tons of careful planning and detailed development of the ""characters"" whom the actors really make come alive...all except Gina...whom I thought was kinda lame.  Satire rules supreme on the Joe Schmo Show.  It ridicules and embraces the reality genre at the same time as it parodies and relies upon the basic elements of Survivor and the bazillion other shows:  immunity challenges, reward challenges, confessional times, stereotypical cast members, and on and on and on.  This is a reality show with all the unpredictability coming from only one individual...and actors and writers and producers who must instantaneously respond to him.
The show ends so well.  After letting Matt in on the secret, they go back and highlight some of his best times.  Matthew Kennedy Gould is a great individual.  I think an unexpected result of the show was the revelation of the goodness of his heart.  I don't think anyone anticipated that happening nor the way Matt touched the lives of the crew.  He always seemed to do the right thing.
If you're sick of canned reality shows...and love to see good individuals get the praise they deserve...and appreciate some tongue-in-the cheek satire...tune in to the Joe Schmo Show.",1087516800,8,1794,4.785714285714286
