4985367,5,B006FYYWQS,"This adorable film uses romantic comedy formatting in a subtle and stylish way to tell a tale of (what some might feel) is an unusual May/December romance.  This structure, I believe, allows the viewer to consider in a non-preachy way the normalcy of love for every man and woman, whether they are hetero or homo sexual in preference.

However focusing on either point belies the true charm of the movie.  It has deep echoes of the ""Doris Day/Rock Hudson"" era, when light romantic comedy bought not only entertainment to the viewers, but wit, charm and elegance back into style.

What I adore about this film is that it sneaks up on you.  Before you know it you are laughing out loud, rooting for the characters, caught up in their lives and cheering at the end.

What more can you ask for in a film about love overcoming all?  Do yourself a favor and grab this movie and a bucket of popcorn.  You will have a heck of a fun night.",1328918400,5,930,4.429411764705883

Wendie Malick is hysterical and I LOVE Megan Hilty from SMASH and had
no idea she was even in it.  The ending really tied it all together
and the maid was great, could have seen more of her. I also really
enjoyed the deleted scene with the flashback and wish had had been in
the movie. Glad I bought it and we will positively watch it again!",1328918400,20,411,4.074074074074074
4985369,2,B006FYYWQS,"After reading many accolades regarding the film ""What Happens Next"", I purchased this DVD hoping to view a ""May-December"" romance between two men similar to the ""Rock Hudson-Doris Day"" films of the 1960s with a ""gay twist"".  Instead of a ""feel good"" ""fluffy"" romance, I spent 110 minutes viewing a clich&eacute; ridden flick (i.e., two bossy and overbearing sisters that rule their weak brothers, a ""know it all"" very loud-mouth manicurist, an extremely Nelly friend, cute young guy that just can't find anyone that is acceptable in those that are in pursuit of him, etc).  All of the clich&eacute;s would have been tolerable had they been done with loads of humor but alas there is very little humor, to me, in this flick.

Of all the acting Wendy Malick, of numerous TV sitcoms, turns in the funniest performance; however, she too seems to grow weary of her overused signature line that she was on the ""verge of a nervous breakdown""--I grew weary of it too.

Yes, I do feel that I have wasted my money but as I've stated before, ""You win some and you lose some"".",1328918400,8,1064,4.67379679144385

It also has the hottest kissing scene I've seen in a while. And Wendie Malick steals the show every time she's onscreen. The only negative thing I really have to say about What Happens Next is that it starts off kind of slow.

I first watched What Happens Next because it was recommended to me by Netflix. I have since watched What Happens Next more times than I can count. I love the story because it touches on a few issues that are prevalent within the gay community. Paul Greco is in his fifties, recently-retired, affluent and in the closet. Andy Chance is in his late-twenties, self-employed and out and proud. The only thing these two seem to have in common is that they both like to bring their dogs to the park at the same time every day. Though Paul initially resists, the two men eventually form a friendship and eventually Andy helps Paul become more and more comfortable with the idea of being a gay man. The onscreen chemistry between Jon Lindstrom and Chris Murrah is so natural and so are the other characters relationships with the main characters.

4985386,1,B006FYYWQS,"I live in Philly, so the lovely shots of Rittenhouse Square' and the
skyline were fun to see in a film. Unfortunately, they were about the
only thing truly worthwhile in ""What Happens Next."" My partner and I nearly
stopped watching it halfway through because the plot and dialog are
sooooo creaky, implausible, formulaic and -- as gay issues go -- out of date (the heavy-handed pitches for PFLAG really had us shaking our heads).
This is the kind of film that MIGHT have had an audience about 30 years
ago, when there were fewer happy gay romantic comedies to see, and when
the characters' issues around being gay were still timely in an urban setting.  The
cast is relatively game in performing the groan-worthy screenplay and unlikely
relationships -- though, with the exception of Chris Murrah (Andy), each actor has only about one emotional note to play (Murrah gets
maybe two and a half -- though it's never clear what really attracts him to Paul). Wendie Malick does her usual over-the-top job
of providing gratuitous drama and antagonism in an otherwise low-key story (as she did,
for example, in ""Racing Stripes""). Production values are decent enough,
though the cinematographer's filter choices sometimes make characters look jaundiced, and there are continuity issues.  All in all, I'm not sure
how this movie warranted the expense of its being made without some serious reworking of the screenplay.",1412812800,3,1409,4.991489361702127

4985395,3,B006FYYWQS,"Now to be fair, I can buy into the 55 year old gay awakening story angle. It's not completely unheard of and I've encountered friends who weren't able to come to terms with their sexuality until much later in life. But it would have helped if Paul had had other on the fly ""experiments"" over the years, even if only under the influence of alcohol. To have completely no idea about this side in him primarily because of conversations with a young guy in the park was a bit of a stretch, but I suppose one just have to buy into the movie logic at work here.

And for the young man to claim to be wary about things in the beginning but still feel like he was somehow cheated or used in the process of becoming more intimate with Paul just felt very immature. I could see this turn coming from a mile a way but I still hoped against hope that it wouldn't go down this road. But of course a movie needs conflict and the first night together was of course going to be used as the vehicle for movie drama moments. I think the movie makers could have gone in a new direction in this area, but clearly it was an opportunity wasted.

And it's a shame since there were some genuinely interesting moments during the various conversations between Paul and Andy. But all that had to give way to the predictably ""clever"" interconnections factored into the story once you bring in the plot threads related to Elise's son. They made sure there were plenty of reasons for the various characters to mix up the plot later in the movie. Paul was Brian's confidant while Elise already suspected he was gay. She tries to attend a PFLAG to better understand her son and this leads her to meeting Andy, who is a volunteer. Rince, lather and repeat.

The movie isn't the rib-tickling variety of comedy. If ever, it's more the type of comedy that involves unusual or even uncomfortable situations that are supposed to be amusing to the audience. You will never really laugh in the movie but I guess you might smile a few times. Or maybe just a smirk.",1390176000,,2023,4.389333333333333

Every word out of all ""actors'"" mouths was forced; no natural flow to anything. Putting in a few curse words not only made the ""actors"" visibly uncomfortable but made the movie scream desperation. When I stopped the player, the new 2013 Fall series ""The Millers"" came on and I was immediately laughing. Take the 5-star reviews with a grain of salt on this one because the ""comedy"" here is totally contrived.",1380931200,,639,4.981308411214953
4985401,5,B006FYYWQS,"This movie sits somewhere on the intersection of romantic comedy, love story, and domestic drama, but does so very gracefully. It's played more delicately than most dramas, has more nuance than most romantic comedies, and has more humor than a general love story.

Jon Lindstrom plays Paul Greco, CEO who retires at 50 and finds himself at loose ends. He meets Andy (Chris Murrah), a younger gay man, and as they develop a friendship, Paul starts to question his sexual orientation. His overbearing but loving sister, Elise (Wendy Malick), meanwhile struggles with her estrangement from her son, who is a photographer instead of the lawyer she wants him to be, and with her long-standing fear that he is g-a-y (she can't quite bring herself to say the word).

The focus of the story is truly on Paul and Andy, who are played to near perfection. Chris Murrah radiates so much warmth and sweetness as Andy that it's easy to see how Paul, who has never really had a strong romantic attachment in his life, is drawn to him, and Lindstrom is excellent in both the poignant and comic moments. While I enjoyed Wendy Malick's performance, I think it might have fitted more if it were dialed down just a notch or two--she played most moments more broadly than the other performers, so much so that it stood out in contrast. This might be an artifact of the writing, as it's rather difficult to imagine an otherwise sophisticated and worldly woman seeming so awkward with the concept of homosexuality. While there are certainly sophisticated and worldly bigots in the world, her reactions seemed more like somebody from the 50s, not somebody who is in her 50s.

There's some profanity (the kind that anybody who's passed a high school locker room will have heard) and some brief and non-explicit sex. However, a viewer who's old enough to find a movie about relationships to be of interest should be able to take this in stride.",1380931200,2,1918,4.771084337349397

4985403,5,B006FYYWQS,"I won't go into the plot as others have so thoroughly described the plot, but I did want to say how delightful this movie was.  Lovely characters, great friendships, and one of the most beautiful first kisses between two characters that I've seen.

There was something about the feel of the movie that reminded me of the old romantic comedies but without some of the frenetic feel that some of them had. It was just a beautiful, gentle movie. It would have been great without the wonderful Wendie Malick but she made it even better - as she does anything in which she appears.

I started watching this for something to distract me while on the treadmill and was so charmed that I didn't want to stop watching.  I'll definitely watch it again.",1379116800,,742,4.556390977443609

Successful straight(?) fifty-something retired executive Paul (Jon Lindstrom) is given a puppy as a retirement gift by his meddling sister. This leads Paul to the park where he meets engaging and successful gay thirty-something dog owner Andy. (Chris Murrah) The two strike up a friendship, meeting daily at the same bench in the park over the next month. Paul, who has always considered himself straight but confesses to being occasionally curious, admits to Andy that he has growing feelings for him, and since in the past he had never really been willing to face the questions he had about his own sexuality, he has no idea how to handle the situation. Andy, who the adorable Chris Murrah plays with incredible humor and sensitivity, invites Paul to dinner.  A deliciously passionate and steamy first kiss after dinner decides the matter once and for all...or does it?

""What Happens Next"" is a thought provoking and wonderfully fun romance movie. It is a deeply sensitive story about love.  Yes, it about a mid-fifties man facing and realizing his sexuality, but it is also about a man and his shock and confusion upon finding that his true love happens to be another man!

During the walk, Mrs. Greco greets Andys dog, Bean. The two men share the park bench and the magic begins. Natalia Cigliuti is wonderful as Andys best friend Roz and Ariel Shafir as Elises son Brian completes the characters of the main story line.
 Sex is implied in this film, as opposed to being overt.  This is a sensible choice on the part of the director (Jay Arnold) as overt sex scenes would ruin the movie. However, the Kiss between Andy and Paul is filled with all the uncertainty, yearning and desire of the hottest, perfect first kiss.

As I expected, Malik steals the show in her supporting role as a neurotic socialite who suspects her son is Gay but ultimately learns that it's actually her unmarried brother(Jon Lindstrom) who is.

Featured here is a very sweet ""May-December"" romance between a closeted and very wealthy 55 year old and a cute 30 year old Gay self-employed advertising agent(Chris Murrah)who's quite comfortable in his own skin and apparently doesn't have much interest in men his own age. The two men meet each other in the Philadelphia park outside their apartments where they go each day to walk their dogs--- two of the sweetest and most adorable little pooches you can imagine.

4985416,4,B006FYYWQS,"I heard about What Happens Next on Facebook when the film was in production, but was unable to locate it in Australia. When I came across it on Amazon I bought it straight away.

What Happens Next is the story of 55 year old businessman Paul Grecco, who has sold his company only to find himself retired by the new owners on the day of the sale. With a successful career behind him, Paul finds himself with plenty of money and time and no idea what to do to fill in his days.

His sister Elise buys him a dog - side note that dog is so cute, I want one - to keep him company. During their daily walks in the park Paul meets another young dog owner and a relationship begins to develop. For the 1st time in Paul's life he's not distracted by work, and begins to analyse and come to term with his sexuality.

What Happens Next is a really funny romantic comedy. The characters and situations are highly relatable and I loved Wendi Mallick - I mean who wouldn't.

I loved the film, and there were several very funny laugh out loud moments that made it all the more entertaining. I'm thoroughly glad I bought this film and I'm fairly certain it's one I'll watch again and again.",1357948800,2,1174,4.251121076233184

4985420,5,B006FYYWQS,THIS WAS A GOOD LOVE STORY.  WOULD RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS FOR YOUR COLLECTION.  COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AGAIN.  It was nice to see a gay romance movie about where an older man can be in love as much as a 20 year old.,1354838400,,220,3.8444444444444446
4985421,4,B006FYYWQS,"I had this in my Netflix queue for awhile, now I only wish I had watched it earlier. ""What Happens Next"" takes us on a journey with Paul Grecco, who after retiring doesn't have any idea what to do with his life. As a retirement present his sister Elise gets him a dog (the cutest French Bulldog) which he names Mrs. Grecco. One day in the park, he runs into another dog owner, Andy and they begin a friendship, meeting every morning to sit on a park bench while their dogs plays with each other. Eventually, Paul begins to realize he's attracted to Andy and the two decide to date, but Paul's not ready to leave his closet and Andy wants a relationship built on honesty...so what happens next?

With a delightful cast, featuring Jon Lindstrom (General Hospital, As the World Turns) as middle-aged, stuck-in-his-ways CEO Paul Grecco who despite having all the money in the world is having a sexual identity crisis. His busy-body, slightly neurotic sister Elise, played by Wendie Malick (Hot in Cleveland) and this movie has some genuinely touching moments between the siblings. Add in the cute chemistry between Chris Murrah and Jon Lindstrom, whose May-December relationship carries the film and you spend a good time laughing and the other wanting Paul and Andy to finally pull their heads out of their behinds and get together! And while the romance takes time to develop, I think it makes perfect sense since Paul's coming out was so late in life. For a movie that was made on a string budget while being filmed on location in Philadelphia, ""What Happens Next"" is a wonderful treat for any independent movie lover that proves you don't need a big budget to have a quality movie. After ""Shelter"" and ""Latter Days,"" ""What Happens Next"" has easily moved into my `Top Ten Gay-Themed Movies of All Time!'

4985422,5,B006FYYWQS,"I rather enjoyed it. A bit corney, but it was a sweet movie. After getting into the movie, after about 5 minutes, I did not want to miss the rest. The acting was great, the storyline was good, the ending was wonderful. It was also a storyline I could relate to, given that I am an older guy dating a younger guy. If I had to watch it again, yes I would. I thought it had warmth, great moments, thought provoking, and reassurance of relationships as typical in today's world. I could see me as the stuff shirt trying to play along with the younger guy, who loves to enjoy life. As he finally came around to the younger guy's attitudes, so did I. So, it did hit close to home. Would I watch it again? Yes, several times, as a matter of fact.",1348185600,,739,4.138888888888889
4985423,4,B006FYYWQS,This was a very enjoyable comedy. It's a movie geared to a more mature audience. I don't think a twentysomething could relate. Wendy Malick is great as always! Only criticism would be that it's a bit far fetched to have the lead be a man in his fifties who never realized he was gay. The premise is a bit dated in 2012. But it was still a fun movie.,1346889600,4,349,4.072463768115942
4985424,4,B006FYYWQS,"Came upon this movie quite by accident and really enjoyed it. Easy to watch and enjoy. Don't expect War & Peace, but a nice feel good gay themed movie.",1342310400,,151,4.241379310344827
4985425,5,B006FYYWQS,"This is a feel good romantic comedy with lots of love--love between brother (Paul played by Jon Lindstrom) and high maintenance sister (Elise played adoringly by Wendie Malick-I love her as haughty Nina on ""Just Shoot Me"" and soap star wannabe Victoria Chase on ""Hot in Cleveland""),love between two close friends (Andy played by charming Chris Murrah and Roz played by Natalia Cigliuti, who is charming, warm and yet bitchy as gallery owner), love between man and man's best friend (Paul with cute ""Mrs. Greco"" and Andy with ""Bean""), love between family members who drive us crazy (Brian played by Ariel Shafir and his ""I'm-having-a-nervous-breakdown"" mom, Elise as well as Paul). The music is perfect for this movie-simple and sophisticated and just right for the light-hearted feel. Perfromances are fun to watch. It is fun to watch the slow getting-to-know-you progress between Andy and Paul--oddly, it reminded me of the way the two people became entwined by their own dogs in 101 Dalmatians. Elise is the perfect comic foil to Paul who tries so obviously to set up her brother so he can be happy. She tries in her clumsy way to make her son happy but mostly succeeds in driving him crazy. Then she tries to understand him by going to a PFLAG meeting and ends up meeting Andy who volunteers there--she ends up befriending Andy and they hit it off. You cannot help but love a movie about dogs and love and witty music and heartfelt expressions and happily ever after endings.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Happens-Next/dp/B006FYYWQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Happens Next</a>",1341360000,6,1628,5.289575289575289
4985426,5,B006FYYWQS,"This was a great movie. It's accessible for all adult audiences, as most of us can relate to the struggles and themes. The acting was excellent and the movie flowed well. I will definitely watch it again, taking advantage of the opportunity to share it with friends. A great romance story! Highly recommended.",1341273600,5,309,4.849056603773585
4985427,4,B006FYYWQS,"Movie was very entertaining, had me laughing the whole time. However, good acting isn't something you should be looking for in this film. Other than that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed this movie!",1339027200,2,191,5.193548387096774
4985428,5,B006FYYWQS,"This was an unexpected great.  I thought it looked cute, but really was not sure.  This was a great movie that flows well, and is a feel good one for sure.  It takes many different topics that have not been deals with before so I really enjoyed it.",1338681600,10,248,4.125
4985429,1,B006FYYWQS,"I was looking forward to this little flick, but I wished someone had warned me the way I am warning you.
This movie is so bad.  The dialog is stilted, there is no chemistry between the leads, pretty much all of the acting is subpar, it has a bunch of story lines that go nowhere, and in general was PAINFUL TO WATCH.  I love quirky comedies and don't mind camp; however this was neither.  It was just lame and awkward.
Seriously, do not waste your time or your money.
The only redeeming factors are some very cute dogs and I do enjoy Wendy Malick (who looks fabulous in every outfit).
Still not enough to make it worth either your time or money.",1337040000,7,645,4.270491803278689
4985430,4,B006FYYWQS,I thought that the two lead actors and Wendy Malick gave excellent performances.  I think this movie was a lovely romance.  I did not choose to watch it because it is a Gay movie.  I chose to watch it because I admire the actors in it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good romance!,1336953600,2,302,4.155172413793103
4985431,3,B006FYYWQS,"Yet another US indie cinema product. And yet again just avarage. The plot is simple and quite easy to forsee. There is a guy in his 50's who discovers that he MIGHT be a homosexual, there is his uptight sister and her son who seems to be a gay, but is not, but she thinks he is.
And there is this likeable gay who has no luck in love (fresh story, isn't it?) who by coincidence is also a volunteer at a lgbt organisation and who meets our closeted handsome in a park.
With dozen other characters (all of them being cliche) we are invited to watch a coming-to-terms-with-me-being-a-gay kind of story. But this time it's about an older man who discovers his ""darker"" side :)
I would lie if I said that I don't like the concept. Unfortunately, the story is not challenging at all. Everybody knows what will happen in the climax. Why so many directors think that including a drama scene at the end of a gay-theme movie is a must???
What else? The acting is really average, unnatural at some moments. There are scenes where the best ""actor"" is the white french bulldog:(
And since I have adored this breed for many years, I've added the 3-rd star :)",1336694400,,1144,4.375586854460094
4985432,5,B006FYYWQS,"Paul Greco (frequent soap actor Jon Lindstrom) lived the past 31 years of his life as a workaholic CEO of a business he built from scratch.  Now, bought out and tossed aside, he is financially secure but alone, despite a long history of aborted relationships with a variety of women over the years. His sister, Elise (Wendie Malick), buys him a puppy to keep him company, and, while walking the puppy in park across from his luxury apartment, Paul meets Andy, a self-assured, intelligent 30-something gay man, who ignites a latent spark in Paul, who never considered he might not be heterosexual. Paul becomes more and more comfortable spending time with Andy, but can't reconcile the reality that he might want a loving, sexual relationship with another man.

The screenwriter, Jay Arnold, deserves kudos for telling a realistic story about a man who has procrastinated on reconciling his sexuality for most of his life.  Despite a minimal budget and occasional over-acting, the film is good enough for mainstream distribution.  It's funny, with a light positive message, and is an excellent choice to screen for friends or relatives dealing with acceptance of someone in their lives who came out to them.

Not rated, but would be a light R for sexual situations.  DVD extras include deleted scenes.  Also available streaming and video-on-demand from various,sources.  I give it a full five stars out of five.",1335312000,32,1410,5.021459227467811
4985433,5,B006FYYWQS,"Jom Lindstrom, Wendie Malick and Chris Murrah anchor the entire fine cast of this film.  The story is excellent and told with both seriousness and humor.

It is an unusual and uncommon story of someone coming out in his 50s combined with retirement, new dog ownership and finding romance on a park bench with a younger man.  The subplots of friends, art galleries, disappointing, possibly gay sons and being set up with female dates rounds out the film.

Though my description sounds like a soap opera, this film seemlessly combines all these elements into a hugely fun and entertaining movie.  I highly recommend it.",1333238400,2,617,4.894230769230769
4985434,5,B006FYYWQS,A feel good movie about a 55 year old man understanding who he is.  Excellent ending and they all live happily ever after.,1332374400,2,122,4.304347826086956
4985435,2,B006FYYWQS,"I'm a huge fan of indie gay films.  There are some really great ones out there...this one was not one of them.  With Wendie Malick in the credits, I thought this film couldn't miss.  She was flawless.  The rest of the cast was stiff; their characters and dialogue weren't even close to believable.

The writing was poor and the editing was choppy at times.

For a $3.99 rental on Amazon Video on Demand...not bad...I wouldn't spend more than that.",1329091200,9,447,4.594936708860759
4985436,4,B006FYYWQS,"Someone gave me this movie the other day.  I'm not sure why since I'm, well, straight.  Actually, they did because I'm a movie nut and a BIG supporter of indies.  And I happen to be a fan of the 2 leads, Wendie Malick & Jon Lindstrom.  I have to say, besides being a little rough around the edges (indies always are and probably should be) this was a very enjoyable little film.  Well written, played with deftness and humor by all the actors.  I was admittedly hesitant to watch a ""gay"" movie, but it turns out that's not what it really is.  It's a parable presented as a rom-com.  The comparison to the Doris & Rock flicks is appropriate, as it has charm and wit, the colors are vibrant and rich, and the locations feel like they could come from another era.  Malick is dependably hilarious as the overbearing sister (and mother, which is a important plot point.)  Lindstrom provides the kind of grounded strength and dignity he's known for, but displays a light comic touch I didn't expect.  It's easy to believe these two are siblings.  Chris Murrah as ""Andy"" is a find and I hope to see more from him.  And a hilarious Megan Hilty turns up in an unexpected cameo.  I can see why she's being talked about.  All in all, I think this is a successfully wrought film about family expectations and love and why it's important to be yourself.  It's message is a good one.  This movie just works.  Oh, and it's pretty damn funny.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Happens-Next/dp/B006FYYWQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Happens Next</a>",1329091200,9,1582,4.90566037735849
