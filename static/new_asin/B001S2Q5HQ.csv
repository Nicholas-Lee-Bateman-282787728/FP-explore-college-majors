8339386,4,B001S2Q5HQ,"The video is great.  It is fun, simple and cute.  There is more story than the title suggests.  The songs are fun.  Young relatives seem mesmerized by it.  The animation  reminds me of days gone by (comfortable and simple).  I didn't mind listening to it repeatedly (after viewing it in full) while doing something else as others in the family watched and enjoyed it again.  This could be a good series for the young ones.
