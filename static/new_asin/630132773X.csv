Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ... ""The Cariboo Trail"" (1950), ""The Nevadan"" (1950), ""Colt .45"" (1950), ""Santa Fe"" (1951), ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Fort Worth"" (1951), ""Man in the Saddle"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Man Behind the Gun"" (1952), ""Hangman's Knot"" (1952), ""Thunder over the Plains"" (1953), ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953), ""Ten Wanted Men"" (1954), ""Riding Shotgun"" (1954), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""Rage at Dawn"" (1955), ""Tall Man Riding"" (1955), ""A Lawless Street"" (1955), ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956), ""Seventh Cavalry"" (1956), ""Decision at Sundown: (1957), ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957), ""The Tall T"" (1957), ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958), ""Ride Lonesome"" (1959), ""Westbound"" (1959),  ""Comanche Station"" (1960) --- Scott's age seemed to matter little, they only came to see another Randolph Scott film and always got their money's worth --- Scott's films were good and getting better becoming classics --- so if you ever wonder ""What Ever Happened To Randolph Scott"", just rent or purchase one of his films and you'll see he's never left us.

324763,4,630132773X,"I bet you didn't think there'd be a history lesson here, huh? When Texas sought entry into the Union as a slave state in 1845, the federal government prohibited slavery north of 3630' parallel north, citing the 1820 Missouri Compromise. Under the Compromise of 1850, Texas ceded its lands north of 3630' latitude. The abandoned 170-mile stretch of land - bordered by New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas - would eventually become the Oklahoma panhandle. But before that it was a neutral zone with no formal territorial ownership, and often informally referred to as ""No Man's Land.""

1946's BADMAN'S TERRITORY massages the truth some. The film's voiceover narrator asserts that, in the territories' race for statehood, this strip of land was overlooked by the government and quickly became a haven to outlaws and all manner of riffraff. To quote the narrator, ""No United States Marshal dared venture there.""

While Randolph Scott had been in oaters before - most notably, for me, as John Wayne's rival in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spoilers/dp/B0001FVDX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spoilers</a>&nbsp;(1942) - it was around this period that he turned his focus to B-western cinema and began to develop into a cowboy star. Here, he plays Texas Sheriff Mark Rowley who pursues the James gang into the prairie town of Quinto, the unofficial county seat of Badman's Territory.

In Quinto, Sheriff Rowley runs into some of the Old West's most notorious lawbreakers - the James gang, the Daltons, Belle Starr, and Sam Bass - while finding time to romance the lovely editor of the Quinto Citizen. See, Henryetta Alcott (Ann Richards) is a truth-speaking woman, and so her fledgling paper is wildly unpopular, seeing as how Quinto is populated by the law's most wanted. In a raucous purgatory unrecognized by the government and where federal law holds no jurisdiction, the straight-shooting Sheriff finds himself toeing a delicate line.

Randolph Scott is one laconic saddled hero, and the unwavering toughness he exudes is put to good use in BADMAN'S TERRITORY. This western was well-received enough that it inspired the not-exactly-a-sequel-more-of-a-remake, 1948's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-the-Bad-Men/dp/B002EZ5BCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of the Bad Men</a>, in which Scott butts heads with the Sundance Kid and Billy the Kid. Eternal cowboy sidekick ""Gabby"" Hayes is featured in both films, playing wildly disparate roles. In RETURN OF THE BAD MEN, he's a respectable banker. In BADMAN'S TERRITORY, he's a drunken, harmonica-playing, bank-robbing accomplice named the Coyote Kid.

BADMAN'S TERRITORY would have us believe that Sheriff Mark Rowley and newspaper editor Ms. Alcott are instrumental in this lawless place's annexation to Oklahoma, done so as to fully ""enjoy official law and order."" All I know is, whoever's responsible, I'm forever grateful. Oklahoma is so much easier to identify with that panhandle. Without the panhandle, it's as nondescript as, say, Kansas or the Dakotas. So, thanks, Randolph Scott!",1376956800,3,3153,5.757510729613734

324768,5,630132773X,"BADMAN'S TERRITORY was the first of three solid little RKO oaters from the late 1940s featuring Randolph Scott (the other two were TRAIL STREET and THE RETURN OF THE BAD MEN).  All are solid features, very entertaining, with action galore, good plots, although not too much character development (action predominates). BADMAN'S TERRITORY, the first in the series, throws in just about every outlaw of the old West for Scott to deal with. Gabby Hayes adds some zestful comedic antics. Production values are high...great fun. Recommended.",1249862400,5,536,5.305882352941176
324769,4,630132773X,"This is a fine western, one of the better ones of its era and one that, sadly, is hardly known. Generally speaking, it''s a fun movie that should have a big audience. With no DVD available (as of this writing), few people will ever hear of it.  It's sad I am only the second reviewer here.

The story is fast-moving because of a nice mixture of action, suspense, romance and even some comedy.

Randolph Scott, Gabby Hayes, Ann Richards and Ray Collins are all fun to watch. Scott acted with Shirley Temple and with Astiare & Rogers, etc., but a western is where he looked the most comfortable. As a bonus, we get tough-guy film noir man Lawrence Tierney playing Jesse James!

Not super, but a solid and entertaining old western.",1247443200,,728,4.534351145038168

I'm watching it right now and the scan I have posted of the Turner Home Entertainment display box clearly proves the contrary.

As for the film itself, this is another of Scott's terrific shoot-'em-ups from the mid-'40s, co-starring the inimitable Gabby Hayes, here doing his usual comic turn, this time as the Coyote Kid. Also present are lovely Ann Richards (""An American Romance""), tough guys Lawrence Tierney (""Reservoir Dogs"") and Steve Brodie (""The Far Country""), and Isabel Jewell as Belle Starr. Set in the Oklahoma panhandle, the plot involves Scott as a Texas sheriff who rides into lawless town of Quinto, a veritable nest of outlaws of every stripe.

7810929,2,630132773X,"Badmans Territory is a 1946 B Western that includes just about every badman from the Old West and manages to put them together in Oklahoma. Weve got the Jemas gang, the Dalton brothers, Belle Starr, Sam Bass, and Pat Garrett to name a few.

B westerns were all the rage from the late 40s through 1960, and no one symbolized them more than Randolph Scott. He averaged 3 per year from 1946 through 1957, making as many as 5 in 1951. His friend Joel McCrea averaged slightly less, with a peak of 4 in 1957. The A list actors were also busy. Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann produced more than half a dozen films in the 50s, most of them B westerns (Winchester 73, The Naked Spur) and Stewart managed a few without Mann (Broken Arrow, Carbine Williams, Night Passage). The Duke was busy too, although his westerns were usually considered A films (Rio Grande, The Searchers, and Rio Bravo).

Handsome and rugged Randolph Scott is the Marshal. Randolph Scott (1898-1987) started in silent films and his early career involved playing a variety of characters in a variety of films  My Favorite Wife (1940), To the Shores of Tripoli (1941), Captain Kidd (1945), Home Sweet Homicide (1946) - but by the 50s he was appearing exclusively in B westerns  Sugarfoot (1951), Carson City (1952), The Bounty Hunter (1954), 7th Calvary (1956), Westbound (1958) - most of which were directed by Budd Boetticher (7 films) or Andre de Toth (6 films).  By the time he made Ride the High Country (1962) Scott had amassed a fortune from California real estate investments, and he retired from film making because he considered his performance in High Country to be a good note to go out on.

George Gabby Hayes (1885-1969) plays Coyote, a friend of the James brothers.. Hayes was John Waynes sidekick in dozens of films from 1933 (Riders of Destiny) to 1935 (Rainbow Valley) when Hayes moved on to partner with Hopalong Cassidy and later with Roy Rogers and then Gene Autry.  Hayes made nearly 200 films between 1929 and 1950.

Steve Brodie (1919-92) is Bob Dalton. He made more than 100 films between 1944 and 1988. In Return of the Badman  (1946) he played Cole Younger.

Tim Whelan (1893-1957) is the director. Whelan began directing in 1928 and specialized in comedies like Larceny Street (1987) and The Divorce of Lady X (1938), but he also did more serious films like Sidewalks of London (1938), Clouds over Europe (1939). This was one of his few Westerns.

In 1946 the biggest hits were Song of the South, Duel in the Sun, The Best Years of our Lives, The Postman Always Rings Twice, and Blue Skies. The big Oscar winner was The Best Years of our Lives (Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor). Other notable films were Frank Capras Its a Wonderful Life, Bogart and Bacall in The Big Sleep, Burt Lancaster in The Killers, and The Yearling.

This film was so popular it spawned  Return of the Bad Men in 1948 and Best of the Bad men (1951).

If you're a fan of B westerns, this one is for you. But there really isn't anything special about it, especially when you consider that Duel in the Sun was made the same year.",1430611200,2,3100,4.622950819672131
