8601714,5,B00E65SGH4,"This DVD set comprises 2 discs containing all eight episodes of the 1977 BBC TV series SUPERNATURAL (not to be confused with the American hit series). Those who have no clue what this series is about should know that being an older production, the production details are very much outdated and for those used to the fast-paced, in-your-face horror of contemporary times with all the blood and gore, this is definitely not that type of horror. Instead the series relies more on an excellent cast that showcase some truly remarkable performances, with elements of fear and the macabre, and even some romance thrown in for good measure.
Each episode begins and ends with the members of the Club of the Damned. In order to be inducted into this gentlemans only club, the new inductee must first enthrall the existing members with a tale of the supernatural so scary as to curl their toes, and if the inductee should fail, the penalty is death. So it begins with the eight stories featured being:
Ghost of Venice  starring Robert Hardy, a personal favorite; Hardy plays a once famous actor who on a trip to Venice is plagued by some mysterious occurences
Countess Ilona  setting is a remote Hungarian castle, quite atmospheric; the Countess Ilona invites four former lovers to her castle  the men have no idea why they are there (so why did they come? Curiosity perhaps?) and as the night wears on, strange things happen
The Werewolf Reunion  similar theme to the above
Mr. Nightingale  stars Jeremy Brett but one of the weakest stories in the collection
Lady Sybil  Denholm Elliott (who was mesmerizing in his performance in M.R. James Ghost Stories for Christmas, The Signalman) delivers an excellent performance here in a tale of an old woman plagued by a stalker in her mansion
Viktoria -  one of my favorite episodes featuring spirit transference
Night of the Marionettes  Gordon Jackson plays a researcher of Mary Shelleys Frankenstein  together with his wife and daughter, the family put up at a remote hotel where creepy things occur. Excellent production.
Dorabella  my partiality to vampire stories makes this my personal favorite in the collection.

Final verdict: If you love old school chills, and don't mind outdated production details, a slower pace, and lack of CGI effects/ gore/slasher type stories, this has enough atmosphere and several really good episodes to satisfy.",1434240000,3,2384,4.979848866498741
