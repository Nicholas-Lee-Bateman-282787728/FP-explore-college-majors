3149167,5,B001614F0S,"Im not even a big batman fan (go Supes). But when you put a dark iconic hero with a dark story and mix it up with japanese animation and have the guys that gave us Ghost in the Shell, Spriggan and Ninja Scroll all involved... that can only be big things. They have me sold.",1208217600,10,273,3.981818181818182
3149168,5,B001614F0S,"I think its more like the release of the Animatrix before the 2nd Matrix movie I think? It was like this movie in that it was animated, and all the ""movies"" were done by a different director, and gave a little insight into the matrix universe all on its own. Check it out and I think we'll find when this one comes out that I might be right.",1208044800,9,341,4.029411764705882
3149169,1,B001614F0S,Probably the worst piece of animation I've ever seen. Watched about 20 minutes and turned off. Total waste of time & money,1492732800,,122,4.590909090909091

3149172,1,B001614F0S,This movie was garbage. The animation was horrid to look at and I honestly regret buying it. This is not one movie but 6 short stories and frankly none of them were good and the ones that were even okay were ruined by the horrible animation quality. I regret buying this and tried to cancel my order (ended up watching this with a friend before my item shipped) but was not able to.,1489968000,,382,4.2465753424657535

3149174,5,B001614F0S,An interesting collection of Batman stories each with its own animation and story-making style. If you enjoyed Animatrix you should like this one too. For me it was worthy of adding to the collection.,1487376000,,200,4.911764705882353
3149175,5,B001614F0S,"There were quite a few people I talked to who said they didn't like it, but I can't understand why.  My favorite story in here is the story where he goes to India to learn to deal with his pain.  Awesome animation if you love anime.  From my understanding is was done completely with Japanese animators.  I wish DC would make more films like this and hand their babies over to more animators and directors who can provide new insight and could prove to tell some very good stories.",1485907200,,481,4.370786516853933

3149178,2,B001614F0S,"I rented this video on the basis of the cover art and the fact that Kevin Conroy voiced Batman (turns out he did all but one episode. The stories were good, the backgrounds great, animation well done, but the character designs were terrible. I dislike Japanese manga style. The first story designs were horrible. The characters did not even look human. I hoped it would get better in the other episodes, which it did, but not by much. The best of the remaining stories was Deadshot, but overall, I wished I had not wasted my money or time on this.",1482796800,,547,4.48

3149186,2,B001614F0S,"The stories in the anthology are middle of the road, but the animation styles are loose anime that misses much of how the characters of the stories are usually interpreted (in one of the stories, Bruce Wayne is short and thin with brown hair and large brown eyes).

Whether because the makers of the film were experimenting or saving money, it falls flat.  If you were expecting something in the style of Bruce Timm, you will be sorely disappointed.",1476230400,,449,4.670886075949367

3149203,4,B001614F0S,I watched this with my 10 and 12 year old boys who got bored with it rather quickly. I enjoyed the animation styles and typically my boys love anime but the stories were just a little weak to keep their attention. I recommend this for adults but kids may have some difficulty staying entertained.,1464134400,,296,4.5

3149218,3,B001614F0S,It was ok. It got better with the later stories. It is six stories with different ways of discussing Batman and how he deals with crime. It is definitely not kid friendly.,1461024000,,171,4.375

3149221,5,B001614F0S,"There are reviews talking about it being too violent or not okay for kids. I looked at the ratings and it is PG-13. I would say it is properly rated.

Yes it is a series of 6 cartoons featuring Batman, but it is rated for more mature audiences.

Each of the stories tells a different bit of history of Batman and how he became who he is.

I enjoyed it.",1460505600,,352,4.0

3149223,1,B001614F0S,"Wow that was bad.
I want my time back.
Not one of the short stories - each the size of a TV episode was worth anything.
Assault on Arkham was so much better than this beginner's effort it wasn't funny.
The Batman Beyond episodes and the older batman cartoons had story lines that were a million times better than this drivel.",1459468800,,325,4.344262295081967
3149224,2,B001614F0S,"I was pretty disappointed in this film. It's the first animated DC comics film that I actually disliked. The animation, the format of the storytelling, and the story itself were all subpar and, frankly, odd. Look elsewhere. Every other option I've watched was superior.",1459296000,,269,5.136363636363637

3149241,1,B001614F0S,I actually thought this was pretty much junk. So glad I didn't pay for it. The stories are not compelling at all and I turned it off before it was even over. It just looked like silly anime stories about Batman that to me really made no sense. Hard pass if you are contemplating watching.

3149250,3,B001614F0S,"I grew up watching Batman the animated series and I've seen most of the major Hollywood batman films and recently I have been revisiting the batman animated series of my youth with my kids.  When I saw this DVD I thought it would be a great combination of animation with the Christian Bale batman universe.

I did enjoy most of the short story cartoons but, I felt their were several factors that really injured its overall presentation.  The screenwriting of the Batman animated series did not have batman speaking much but the things he said many edifying things that were overall good moral messages.  I am sure that a close analysis of these short stories could find something in them with a good moral message, but only one of the short stories really had something close to it when batman abandons the use of a gadget that while making him very protected might endanger others.

Some of the short stories seemed artsy (and I am not talking about the animation) like the hindi guru one, but others struck me as having a good overall short story feel (deadshot). Perhaps the diversity might appeal to others peoples taste, but I would have preferred a more focused approached to the story telling.",1443916800,3,1201,4.7

I really enjoyed each directors different take and how Batman is presented. Kevin Conroy is back as the voice of the Batman and damn if he doesn't add to the juice of this.

Have I got a story for you: A group of skateboarders each run into Batman at different times and their imaginations run wild. Is he a vapor, a vampire, a robot or something else?

Crossfire: Two cops (one thinks Batman is just a vigilante while his partner thinks otherwise) caught in a crossfire between rival mobs. Will Batman save them both?

Field Test: Lucious Fox and Batman have new toys to try out. Will they work as advertised?

In Darkness Dwells: Killer Croc is on the loose in Gotham.

Working through pain: We know Batman gets hurt/injured regularly....this shows how the does it.

Deadshot: Deadshot is back in Gotham aiming for Gordon. Bruce/Batman lets you know how he feels about guns.",1429056000,3,1100,4.586734693877551

It's like they gave animation grad students free reign on making a short film as long as Batman was involved.  The first film didn't add to the story, just showed how wild teenagers tend to recollect events. The Japanese Anime style video just turned Batman into a boy-band looking teenager.  Normally I can look past small story details or minor deviations from lore, but this compilation of short films did nothing to improve the Batman storyline.

3149301,4,B001614F0S,"Gotham Knight is an incredible and creative animated film consisting of 6 segments. Despite not being a huge fan of anime, the studios do a wonderful job with the animation most of the time. The voice acting is also very top notch and Kevin Conroy is incredible as always in each segment as The Bat. It isn't perfect and some of the segments aren't quite as good as the others, but the film as a whole is incredible.

1. Have I Got a Story for You
Kicking off the film is what is probably the most ambitious and probably the most polarizing segment of the movie. Have I Got a Story for You  consists of three kids telling stories to one of their friends about their encounter with Batman earlier that day as he was battling The Man in Black. Each of the three kids' stories interlock (being told in reverse order) and they all have opposing views on what they think Batman is (a vampire, a Man-Bat, or a Robot). To me this one is incredible and probably the most interesting of all the segments. With an incredibly creative story and solid animation, Have I Got a Story for You stands out in fantastic fashion amongst the other segments. - 9.5/10

2. Crossfire
Following the incredible introduction comes Crossfire. This segment focuses on two cops with opposing views on Batman, one believing he has helped the city and the other who believes he's just vigilante the police shouldn't associate with. On their way back from transporting The Man in Black (the villain in Have I Got a Story for You) to prison, the two get caught in the middle of a dispute between the Russian Mobsters and Sal Maroni's men. While not as great as Have I Got a Story for You, Crossfire manages to be intense and entertaining (despite a slow start) and is also very wonderfully animated featuring some of the best imagery of the entire anthology. The stand off between the two cops, Sal Maroni, and Batman is also incredibly intense and fun to watch. It's a bit of a drop off from the first segment, but Crossfire is still a good and solid addition in Gotham Knight. - 7.5/10

3. Field Test
Now here is where it gets tricky. Field Test had a ton of potential. In this one Bruce Wayne is gifted with a new piece of equipment from Lucious Fox that can deflect bullets from any small caliber weapons (pistols etc.). However one night the device works too well and injures one of the criminals Batman encounters. This one could have been great, they could have really focused on Batman's no kill policy as well as the guilt that he may have killed someone. The opportunity is wasted as we don't really see any of that, and the henchmen who is injured doesn't even seem to be in any serious condition. Top that off with the animators' horrible decision to give Bruce Wayne an extremely boyish appearance that doesn't match Kevin Conroy's voice at all and Batman a weird awkward costume, and you got probably the weakest segment of the anthology. - 3.5/10

4. In Darkness Dwells
Fortunately, In Darkness Dwells is able to recapture some of the steam from the first two segments that Field Test lacked. When a Cardinal is kidnapped, Batman must venture out into the sewers, which is contaminated by Scarecrowe's fear gas, to save him. The premise is simple, but it still manages to be entertaining and is one again beautifully animated. The big problem with this one, though, is the ending kinda just happens. Its immediate and straight to the point which isn't bad, but here it feels rushed. Also when Batman is contaminated by the fear gas, it doesn't hinder him at all, which kinda makes the entire sewer setting a whole lot less frightening. It's very sloppy, but considering what it followed and also considering how well done the animation is, In Darkness Dwells is passable. It may not stand out, but it doesn't fail to entertain. - 6/10

5.  Working through Pain
Now here is where Gotham Knight comes back swinging.  In this segment Batman is wounded and wandering the underground as he is phoning in Alfred to come retrieve. Working Through Pain , though, is more a story about Bruce Wayne than it is Batman. While he wanders underground, the story flashes back to a time where Bruce is still searching to be trained for his future as Batman. Here Bruce is accepted by a woman named Cassandra who teaches Bruce how to subdue his pain. Working Through Pain is a stand out here. It is easily the most character focused of the six segments and offers the most insight on who Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman really is. The story is phenomenal and its animation top notch. It's alot quieter in terms of action, but the character focus as well as the meaningful ending more than make up for that. - 9.75/10

6. Deadshot
The final segment is also the loudest one. Deadshot is of course about Batman trying to stop an assassination by the notoriously accurate Deadshot. This one is more like one big action scene, but it's a very cool one too say the least. The story is simple like In Darkness Dwells, but the showdown between Batman and Deadshot is awesome and readily the best of the movie. Also Deadshot is wonderfully animated and is probably the best when it comes to looks. Deadshot is also a very entertaining villain and its just so awesome to see him do his thing. This segment satisfies the need for a great fight and nicely wraps up the whole film with a very bloody bow on top. - 8.75/10",1408233600,,5367,4.5476190476190474

  While I loved the previous Batman animated films (even the poorly done Batman vs. Dracula), this Gotham Knight just doesn't work for me.
  Far more appreciated were the documentaries that were on the second disc. Much analysis of the character, especially the villains. That is a documentary to study.
  The feature film was one that I had been eyeing for some years, but now that I have seen it I don't like it. Perhaps it is too dark (literally and metaphorically), and I prefer a straightforward story that is not so dark as this. But the animators keep trying to make Batman darker and darker; so much that people don't like the character anymore. This film encourages me to switch to a sweet Disney film instead. {How about Bruce Wayne singing ""Let It Go""?}. The film was visually and structurally unclear--perhaps more like a person's nightmare, which does not have a logic to them. Often I found the drawing to be crude.
  In addition, the second disc had 4 episodes from Batman The Animated series from the 1990s. These only reminded how much better that series was to this feature film, and inspired me to buy all 4 box sets of Batman: The Animated Series--far more entertaining.",1399766400,,1487,4.92

3149317,4,B001614F0S,"Batman: Gotham Knight is a series of stories, each of them from a different writer and director and with a different animation style. This was released in conjunction with the ""Batman Begins"" movie and you can see the influence of the movie on some of these episodes.

Episode 1: ""Have I Got a Story For You"" - The movie opens in a graffiti-scrawled, indoor skateboard park, where a group of four friends are meeting, each with a different story to tell about an encounter with Batman. The amusing thing is that each encounter is filtered through a child's imagination, where each child sees something different: a Batman who is a living shadow with glowing eyes, who rises out of the ground and just as quickly melts back into it again, a Batman who is an actual bat man, complete with flapping leathery wings, and a Batman who is an armored, morphing, bat-robot, for example.

I've omitted most of the details, of course, and there are some surprises in the various scenes, particularly the ending. The notion that kids like these would see different things isn't entirely new but it's well-executed and the various versions of Batman are amusing, particularly when you contrast it to what you know really happened. The backgrounds are incredibly detailed and elaborate and the figures very stylized. This is a departure from anything the studio has put out before but I think it works.

Episode 2: Crossfire - Detectives Allen and Ramirez have to transport a criminal captured by Batman back to jail. A disgruntled Allen makes his displeasure with the assignment and with a certain ""vigilante"" obvious. It's clear from the conversations that this is early in Batman's career, before he had established himself, and there are wide differences of opinion as to the impact he's having on the city and what to do about him. In the return from the drop-off, the detectives find themselves in the middle of a gang shootout, a shootout that is interrupted by the arrival of the Batman.

The backgrounds in this episode are more cartoonish and, surprisingly for Gotham City, brighter and more colorful, with spotlights sweeping the skies and well-lit skyscrapers in the background, while the foreground always remains dark and shadowed. The music in this episode is particularly noteworthy, changing to fit the mood, from insane shrieks to tuneful hosannas.

Episode 3: Field Test - Lucius Fox has a few technological surprises for Bruce Wayne, including an electromagnetic device strong enough to deflect a bullet, something that a young Batman is clearly interested in. There's only one problem....

This episode seemed to me to be a little bit more anime-influenced, particularly with respect to the character designs. A very young-looking Bruce Wayne would not have been out of place in any episode of Naruto. The Batman, too, is unlike any other rendition of Batman, with the cowl, in particular, unique.

Episode 4: In Darkness Dwells - A church is attacked by an 8-foot ""lizard man"" who came out of the crypts. Batman follows into the sewers, to find that the lizard man is very real and that he has an ally... This is a very odd episode, with hallucinogenic images and vivid colors, sharp contrasts and deep shadows. You're never quite sure what's real and what isn't.

Episode 5: Working Through Pain - A bleeding, exhausted Batman stumbles through the sewers, all the while having flashbacks to various scenes in his past. The primary flashback is of being taught a lesson about pain. There are some genuinely lovely scenes in this episode and it's more thought-provoking than any of the others.

Episode 6: Deadshot - The assassin is in town and he's aiming for Jim Gordon ... or is he? The train and tunnel sequences, in particular, are spectacular, but I was a bit disappointed with the ending.

I love it when an animation studio takes risks, and this movie certainly falls into that category. This is unlike anything the studio has ever done and, for the most part, it works. The mood, the animation style, the at times lovely artwork, the characterizations, all come together remarkably successfully, all things considered. The music fits the various stories very well and the voice characterizations are all spot-on, with the ever-impressive Kevin Conroy as Batman.

So what didn't I like? Well, it really is just a set of stories with no real overarching theme or arc to them and some of the stories I would describe as snapshots, rather than fully-fleshed stories. I'm also troubled by the lack of variety of mood; everything is deep, significant, dark, and brooding. While that does describe Batman, there is more to him and to his story than that. Despite this, I still regard this as a movie well worth seeing, if only to see these different visions of Batman come to life.",1392163200,2,4790,4.893958076448828

Review by A.P. Fuchs

Okay, now this is how you do something new with a character and do it right and totally change the formula. Not only was the style of Batman animation changedthis whole movie is done in anime by genuine Japanese anime directorsbut also instead of giving us one big story, why not give us six shorter ones in the same universe?

This flick was meant as a bridge between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, giving audiences an in-depth glimpse into Batmans past and what hes been up to between those two movies. To make it even sweeter, Kevin Conroy voices Batman for all six short films.

They are (and what I thought):

Have I Got a Story for You -

Premise: A bunch of skater kids relate to each other firsthand encounters with the Dark Knight.

Really good, each story seeming to center around Batman chasing the same thief. The art direction is ridiculous! Did you see the backgrounds in this thing? While the character designs for this vignette were so-so, the backgrounds were insane. What makes this vignette special is it shows how the Batman legend was born, that is, people swapping stories, relating what they thought they saw versus what really happened, and how one tale leads to another until, eventually, Batman is myth and man combined.

Of course, sometimes the facts get straightened out, as per the ending of this story. Youll have to see for yourself what I mean.

Crossfire -

Premise: Two cops take a recently-dropped-off-by-Batman felon to the Narrows for incarceration. There they encounter tons of trouble and Batman comes to the rescue.

This one is much grittier than the previous story, focusing heavily on the cops and gangs. The art is superb and while the backgrounds are more classical animation, the character design is top notch and I really dig how everyone looks in this tale. Batman is boss in this: big, powerful, sleek, toughwish he looked like this all the time. Well done.

The main point of the story is the question: is Batman an ally? One cop thinks so, the other is skeptical, and the conclusion reached? Well, youll just have to see this wicked cartoon for yourself.

Field Test -

Premise: Lucius Fox shows Bruce Wayne some new gear he can use as Batman and he gets a chance to do just that.

How does anyone draw this good? The backgrounds are so realistic its upsetting (in that good way). The character design is very classic anime: pointier noses, smaller eyes, very realistic body proportions.

Batman definitely has a unique style to his suit in this; not your classic uniform but it works. I also like the change of pace by showing his eyes instead of having just whites. I think this is the first time Batmans been animated that way.

All in all, this vignette was great and there is a moral to the story about Batmans stance on guns and how he understands the need to defend himself against them . . . but not at anothers expense.

In Darkness Dwells -

Premise: When a congregation starts going crazy during a church service, Batman thinks the Scarecrow is to blame. Instead, hes greeted by someone far more dangerous: Killer Croc! However, Scarecrow is still waiting in the wings.

Visually, this vignette is very comic-book-like. I see glimpses of Mike MignolasHellboy artist and creatorstyle though I doubt that the animators were trying to imitate that. Its just what it reminds me of.

This one was pretty exciting. Lots of action, lots of danger, lots of Batman stopping baddies and getting out of tight situations. Dig it.

Working Through Pain -

Premise: Suffering from a gunshot wound, Batman flashes back to before he donned the cowl and reflects on pain and what it means in his life physically and emotionally.

This ones pretty gory, but thats to further cement the point of this tale: pain . . . and what it does for Batman, how he deals with it and how he overcomes it. Giving glimpses into Bruce Waynes travels and the training he picked up along the way, we get to see the lengths he went to to perfect his body in the areas of enduring through painphysical and emotionalsomething he no doubt knew he needed to do if he was to succeed in his mission. Except, there is one pain he cant overcome.

Visually, I liked the art style of this one as well.

Deadshot -

Premise: Deadshot comes to Gotham and the word is hes going to assassinate Jim Gordon. When the GCPD catch wind of this, they let Batman know. Batman becomes Gordons shadow and resolves to keep his friend safe.

The art direction in this is like a high-end comic book come to life. Really, really liked it. Great line work, crisp images, solid colors, dark and bleak like a Batman comic. Awesome. And that train tunnel? Gotta be a 3D background but it looks unbelievably cool.

The Batman-vs-Deadshot battle is a sweet one, high speed on a train.

The main thrust of this story is about guns and how Batman feels about them. Since it was a gun that killed his parents, its a touchy area for him.

All six of these stories were well done, well thought out and well written. Im proud to be a Batman fan while watching these and Im equally happy DC tried something new with the character and succeeded in spades. By tying this animated flick into the live action ones, it added a whole new dimension to those stories and to these animated shorts as well.

The 3rd-party ""B68 Solutions Limited"" will try to sell you the UK version. As long as you order directly from Amazon, everything should be fine.

This has 6 short animated stories. Not really tying to the Nolan movies as much as WB advertises. But they are good entertainment regardless.",1379030400,5,538,4.604166666666667
3149330,5,B001614F0S,"When I first started watching Batman - Gotham Knight, I thought I had the wrong DVD in the player, because the animation and story was not what I expected.  After having watched the first 2 movies in the Justice League series (Superman:Doomsday and Justice League:A New Frontier), I expected a similar type of story with similar animation.  This movie couldn't be more different than the others.

Essentially, the movie is made up of 6 short vignettes (about 15 minutes each) in which Batman's rise to superhero status is explored.  He starts out as just a figment of some kids' imaginations and becomes a force against evil in his own right by the end of the series.  The movies are dark, somber, and action packed.  There is a lot of imagery which is fascinating to watch and thought-provoking to consider.  I particularly liked ""Working Through Pain"" and ""Deadshot"", the 5th and 6th episodes in the series of mini-movies.  They nicely tie together the others and help you to see Batman become a full-fledged hero, while at the same time allowing you to see where he came from.

The storylines and dialogue are not simple in this movie and it's important to listen carefully and digest what is said.  There are many themes which refer to how Batman became what he is, and these themes need to be explored and thought about.  I'd venture to say that this movie is one that you should watch more than once, but not just based upon enjoyment, but out of necessity so you can understand it better.

My hat goes off to those that conceived of Batman Gotham Knight and created and developed the movie.  It's truly fascinating and worth watching.  It will make you think of Batman like you never have before.",1378771200,,1703,4.671140939597316

3149344,2,B001614F0S,"Batman Gotham Knight is the second film in the DC animated direct-to-DVD line-up. Superman Doomsday was the first in that line-up. While, I did not find it great, I was entertained by the film. I overall thought it was okay. Gotham Knight, however, I was very disappointed with. Since I liked Superman Doomsday, I had high hopes that the creators would learn from their mistakes with that film, and this movie would be better. However, what I got was a very disjointed mess.

Gotham Knight is six separate stories in one film. Honestly, that is probably the biggest problem with the film. There is no wrap around where all the stories tie in. The stories are very self-contained. This does not feel like a complete film.

To make it worse half of the stories are uninteresting and also poorly animated. A different animator worked on each story. In some stories the animation was great, but in other, it is mediocre or just bad.

I'm not a fan of ""I've got a story to tell you,"" ""Field Test,"" or ""Working Through Pain."" I'm not a fan of the animation and I do not find the stories engaging. When those stories were playing I was wanting to fall asleep. I do like ""Crossfire,"" ""In Darkness Dwells,"" and ""Deadshot."" I liked the animation and the action scenes. So all-in-all the stories are a very mixed bag.

The voice acting was good. Kevin Conroy comes back to voice Batman, which is a plus. He is easily one of the best aspects about the film. The animation is a mixed-bag, like I mentioned earlier. The action is also a mixed bag. In some stories the action is good, but in others it is boring.

Overall, I'm going to have to say that you should skip this one. There are many better animated Batman movies to check out like Mask of the Phantasm, Return of the Joker, Under the Red Hood, etc.",1367452800,,1794,4.49079754601227

3149348,4,B001614F0S,"This was an interesting adaptation to the animated Batman genre.  It combines the edge of your seat excitement and spectacle of Director Chris Nolans live action Batman films as well as the human drama and gritty intrigue of visionary Japanese anime.  The two-disc DVD starts off with six animated shorts combined into one unique feature that explores the origins of the Dark Knights universe.  Although, I have to say that the first segment Have I got a Story for You where these inner-city kids were talking about their perceptions of the legendary vigilante, was a waste of time and totally unnecessary.  However, the other five origin stories were definitely much more enjoyable.  Similar to the live-action 2005 film Batman Begins we see a young Bruce Wayne travelling the world looking for spiritual enlightenment and the physical martial artist skills needed to survive the crime-ridden streets of a disheveled Gotham City.  Here, the characters voice hasn't lost its edge after twenty-years; meaning voice over actor Kevin Conroy, whom is once again at the helm bringing life to the iconic animated Bruce Wayne/Batman.
Unfortunately, the overall appearance of the Wayne character has suffered a severe identity crisis: looking more like the character from the anime cartoon Monster rather than the charming more masculine version of Bruce Wayne.  Aside from that, the remainder of the story from the action sequences to the stunning real-world city landscapes that are Gotham is outstanding!  This is where the artistry of Japanese animation comes into its own, creating natural and very realistic environments.  Its an art form that is desperately lacking in the United States where most animators of today are sadly leaning towards creating cartoons in a computer rather than drawing believable characters on a paper canvas.
 The best part of the DVD for me, was the behind the scenes segment Batman and Me with Batman creator Bob Kane, a revealing glimpse into how the legendary caped crusader became one of the most famous crime-fighting super heroes of all time.  There is also a short segment that delves into the chilling psychology of some of Gotham Citys most infamous villains.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of the Batman cartoons or even the live-action films.  It may not be the Batman animation that were used to but its well worth the time to watch and enjoy an iconic hero in a darker, more grittier Gotham City.",1365552000,,2456,5.034567901234568

3149358,3,B001614F0S,"Fans of The Animatrix will feel right at home with this Blu-Ray; At heart, this is another collection of short stories (loosely connected) outsourced to several prominent Japanese animation studios to bring new, exciting, fresh images of The Batman to American soils.  It's actually quite interesting to see how other studios see Batman.  I certainly can't say it's for everyone; the styles shift so often that it'd be difficult for traditional Batman fans to get a grasp of anything long enough to leave an impression, and would probably come off as confusing.  It doesn't help that the storyline's actually pretty meh, overall.  The stories are loosely based on the universe created by the new trilogy, and it isn't necessary to see this to enjoy the movie installments.

It kinda feels like a cash grab, but it's a fun cash grab if you can suspend your preconceptions.  This is a unique experience that you can't get anywhere else.  Styles shift from styles that will be recognizable by Anime fans; for instance, the first segment was clearly done by the same studio that did Tekkonkinkreet.  A later segment smacks of the studio that did the animation for Aeon Flux; in fact, if you've seen The Animatrix, many of the segment stylings will look uncannily similar.  Because they are.

It's clear that not as much care was put into THIS as was The Animatrix to bring a coherent product together, probably because these segments didn't have the luxury of being self-contained, but were instead weakly stitched together story-wise.  This jarring fact compounds with the abrupt shifts between studios.

However, as a package, it stands up.  The extras range from interesting to EXCELLENT, behind the scenes aside.  As is often the case with DCU releases, Bruce Timm included relatable episodes of The Animated Series.  The theme of the four episodes included appear to be, well, the most visually striking episodes of the series.  The first was a three-part episode that, in the vein of Batman: Gotham Knight itself (or should we say this was in the vein of the Animated Series episode?) multiple EXISTING styles were emulated in a collection of stories, the first being in the classical 50s (?) style, and the LATTER...

...and this is awesome...

An animated short tale from The Dark Knight Returns.  Featuring Frank Miller-esque animation, and Batman voiced by, I kid you not, Michael Ironside.

AWESOME.

The other episodes are equally entertaining, including a fantastic, beautiful showdown with Mr. Freeze, a bizarre What-If scenario where Batman's cover is blown in spectacular fashion, and a bit of a pity-party in the last where Batman does some soul searching.  The latter's not so great of an episode, but the other three more than make up for 'em.  I'm assuming the last two were put in to further explore the relationship between Bruce and Gordon.  But come on, MICHAEL IRONSIDE.

I really love how the extras bring the DCU animated features together.  These guys know how to make good use of Blu-Ray media, and you definitely get your money's worth when you get this.

If you can enjoy the core experience.  If you're looking for something along the lines of The Animated Series, outside of the extras, you're probably going to be disappointed.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  And then I hit the extras, and that's all she wrote.",1356825600,,3338,4.919499105545617

3149363,1,B001614F0S,"this bills itself as some sort of missing link between batman begins and the dark knight. now that in theory sounds good and is enough to get most people excited sadly that is just a bold faced lie.

there are 5-6 short stories i can't remember how many.

the first problem is this makes 0 reference to batman begins. not one single reference which makes its linking ability between the two movies impossible.

the second problem is why in the heck is there a different animation style for each story?

the third problem is the animation is of questionable quality at times. sometimes it is smooth and great and other times it looks clunky usually when it comes to any hand to hand fighting which considering japanese anime does not have this problem and this is done in the style of said anime it really sticks out like a sore thumb.

the only real stand out if the first short story which will lure you into a false sense of security since that one is fairly good and could of been the start of a good link between the two movies but since it like the others is only 10-20 minutes that ends and it moves onto some other unrelated story.

the stories are largely unrelated, have no connection to the two movies it claims to be linking and the overall writing is just a giant mess. it really is just batman tracking down villians which is not bad in and of itself it is just this is billed as a link between the two movies and it does not do that anywhere at all. this fills in none of the holes between the two movies which makes these episodes just random pointless batman stories. had this been advertised as 6 random batman stories i'd be less ticked off. and no i am not going to watch the commentary in special features just to have this explained if the episodes themselves can't do that they fail.

then we have special features....4 episodes of batman the animated series....only the first one of the list even remotely fits the theme of how batman becomes the legendary dark knight which is ironic as only the first of the 5 or 6 short stories fits that theme too. there is also some commentary and other stuff.

overall a really terrible product i spent 8 bucks on the blu ray and i feel that was too much. i don't know what these 5 star reviews are on about this is a complete giant walking mess this is as bad as if you walked in your hung over friends and they have puked all over your floor and bathroom. it really is just that bad.

Totally awesome. They are upscaled so you will see some jagged lines and still some debris on the film, but it's still slightly upgraded over the DVD quality previously released of this Dark Deco masterpiece.

There is also a great documentary on Batman's Rogue Gallery and a cool doc on Bob Kane.

3149373,5,B001614F0S,"Batman: Gotham Knight was advertised to be the missing link between Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight films. While there are reoccurring characters in the film that make appearances in this collection. there wasn't anything in this movie that contains important content that will comepletely tie in with the respective movies. As a stand alone project, I thoroughly enjoyed all 6 short stories of the Batman. If story delves into different ideologies of Bruce Wayne such as his ideology towards guns, his training, and stories that are similar to monthly batman comics back in the day. The overall presentation was the most impressive part of the film, each short story has a distinct style that creates different aspects of the Dark Knight.

I am a casual anime fan so I definitely appreciate the stylistic choices made in the film. If you have ever watched the Animatrix (an anthology bAsed on the matrix saga) than you should know how this film works. It was also nice to hear Kevin Conroy as bat as as well, I couldn't really imagine any other voice actor playing the role. The DVD extras were decent, you get a very informative documentary of Bob Kane and a great featurette that analyzes Batmans most popular villains. You also get an additional 4 episodes from Batman the animated series that help inspired some of the storylines made for the film. if you are a Batman fan, check this film out, if you are a fan of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy than I suggest you buy this film to add to the collection because it is canon to some extent.

3149379,3,B001614F0S,"As plenty of people before me have said, you need to have an open mind about things.
I did...But it was still difficult to enjoy.

We're not so much getting a Batman animated movie here, but more of a collection of episodes that take place in Gotham, and center around Batman. What we're seeing is not so much Batman being Batman, but the people of Gotham noticing Batman and reacting to his actions. This is a movie of 6 episodic features, animated and directed by 6 different people telling the story of Batman making his mark as the Gotham knight.

We open up with teenagers telling their highly made up stories about their encounters with Batman in ""Have I Got a Story For You"". This was a new way to open up to a batman anything, and it was different in a good way. This basically tells the story of how the public is reacting to Batman. After this story, I was ready for the real Batman to get some screen time though, and unfortunately the next story is all about how the police force is reacting to Batman in ""Cross Fire"". This makes sense, but once again we have random characters talking about Batman that will be gone as soon as the story is over. But in this story there's less action, and even less Batman.

Next we have ""Field Test"". I disliked this the most as I'm sure many other fans did as well due to it's feeling that we weren't watching Batman. But in this story we finally get to ""meet"" Bruce Wayne. Probably the most important story to flow smoothly, get to the point, and tie all 6 stories together. It's the first time we see much of the real Batman and it's the third episode, meaning it needs to be strong in order to keep the previous and future stories from breaking apart. There was a large problem for me though...
 I didn't even know That Bruce Wayne was Bruce Wayne because he was nothing like Bruce Wayne. We've now transitioned to full blown anime style; big glossy eyes, unnatural hair, and rather than being the badass we know as Batman he's some fancy, sweet, polite guy with a ""boyish charm"" and a dainty touch. His costume was also redrawn in a way that didn't say Batman to me.
This episode had a bit more reason behind it though, as it explains the armor situation in an incredibly boring way. It was difficult to recover from this, and it took a minute before I regained my interest.

Luckily Madhouse animated ""In Darkness Dwells"" we have a quick story that now shows Batman working with the police, welcoming a solid in between of the noir cartoon we all know and love, and a cool, slight anime style. Coming back to an original Batman vibe, I'd say that the last 3 are the best.
""Working Through The Pain"" shows how much training young Bruce Wayne went through purely to be able to take a beating, and we finally get to see a realistic portrayal of Bruce Wayne (before batman). This had solid animation and a different art style that was easy to accept.

The final, ""Deadshot"" gives us full blown, old fashioned, thick lines, dark shadows, original cartoon noir art. Almost to the extent of over doing it, almost. (It's worth noting that Madhouse animated both ""In Darkness Dwells"" and ""Deadshot"".)
By the end of ""Deadshot"" Bruce is finally receiving the bat signal. Tying things up with a solid ending.

If you watch this as a movie, you will most likely be disappointed by the lack of story flow and commitment to a solid story in general. The amount things jump around will annoy you, and you will find it difficult to say the least to enjoy.

If, however, you watch this as a collection of animated shorts told in very different ways by some very different perspectives, you'll find it worth watching.",1334966400,,3651,4.471471471471472

That said, the rest are fantastic, especially the ""Work Through Pain"". This is not ""Bang"", ""Pow"" Batman. These are character (be it Batman or Gotham Cops...thus Gotham) development stories. They reward the patient viewer. I hate the word ""mature"", but these are more mature stories. Again, not a lot of the ""beat up the bad guy thing"", though it's there too. A big bonus; Kevin Conroy does the voice duties for Batman/Bruce, so that is always a plus.

3149393,2,B001614F0S,"Batman: Gotham Knight is probably the most ambitious of the DC animated films. Four different animation studios based in Japan were commissioned to animate six different secnarios taking place during the early years of Batman's career. This was a project with good intentions but ultimately fails to be truly memorable. If you take away all of the technical wizardy such as the shaky camera movements, fancy camera angles, and CGI effects an over whelming majority of these shorts do not hold up at all. As a matter of fact, only one of these shorts are worth real praise.

The one stand out, and a really good one at that, was the fifth segment entitled ""Working Through Pain"". As Batman/Bruce Wayne is suffering from a gun shot wound, he recalls the training he had gone through in order to adapt to tremendous pain. Bruce ignores what was far more important in his training, dealing with the emotional pain. At the end of the short, in a brilliant illustration, Bruce discovers the futility of attempting to be physically invincible and feels defeated in the end.

Overall, this movie definetly isn't worth the full price tag but I can't down right reject it. The visuals can be stunning at times for all six shorts but there still isn't enough here on the whole to give a passable reccomendation.",1290729600,,1300,4.773333333333333

3149395,3,B001614F0S,"I certainly admire what the filmmakers of Gotham Knights were trying to do.  This is a highly stylized interpretation of Batman, similar to something you might have seen in the early ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" comic book series, as compared to the standard fare in ""Batman"" or ""Detective"" Comics.  The artists are mostly anime, by the look of it, and there are some neat ideas flowing around and through this feature.

As a series of vignettes, people are going to disagree about what stories work and which don't.  For me, the first story is one of the strongest - about how people perceive Batman.  Here the stylized art works especially well because the kids telling the stories of what they've seen are not really sure about the details, or can't describe them well.  The jerkiness and muddiness of the animation is annoying, but it fits the story perfectly.

Unfortunately, the animation is the weakest point of several of the other stories.  Call me traditional, but Batman is a very American entity, and the cleaner/younger/wide-eyed anime style simply clashes with the content, and it does not fit as well as the dark and gritty American style of other Batman comic books and graphic novels.  The original (mid-90s) Batman: The Animated Series style was much superior, in my opinion.  (This 2-disc special edition offers viewers the chance to check this for themselves, as it includes 4 episodes from the Animated Series.)

There are many good points about this film, but it just doesn't come together for me.  Certainly it isn't as good as the bulk of the Animated Series (the Bruce Wayne-as-Batman series, not the atrocious Batman Beyond).  There are also some good DVD extras on this 2-disc set, it's certainly worth getting this disc instead of the 1-disc version.",1283990400,,1778,4.906354515050167

The IDEA behind different art work I thoght was going to be cool, but half the time the art work is so bad, or so Anime that you can not recognize Bruce, that it is distracting.

3149397,3,B001614F0S,"I don't even know where to begin with this one. This is my least favorite out of these movies, making it the black sheep of the DCU family. I'm not a particularly big fan of anime, so when I heard this was going to be done in 5 different styles, I was less than excited. This is even my least favorite Batman movie (yes Batman/movie fans, I hold ""Batman & Robin"" in much higher regard than this) and that's a difficult thing for me to say as Batman is my favorite DC hero.

The movie is actually made up of six short stories that are loosely connected and supposedly take place between ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"". The first is a rehash of ""The New Batman Adventures"" episode ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" (which is far superior to what we get here) in which Four street urchins depict Batman in a different way and each is more ridiculous than the last, the only one I think that even matches Batman is the ""living shadow"" (though Robot Batman looked cool). Then at the end when the real one shows up, his legs are smaller than his entire upper body! He should be falling over from being disproportioned. The animation in this segment is easily my least favorite and the movie wouldn't have suffered without it. The rest of the animation at least resembles each other but not by much. The second story deals with Det. Crispus Allen and Anna Ramirez arguing over if Batman is doing any good for the city only for them to wind up in a shootout between Sal Maroni and a gang of Russians. It's better than part one but the animation is annoying, especially when everybody but the cops and Batman look like zombies. I also hate that eye quivering thing or whatever that shows that people are scared. I just find it annoying. Part three is Batman testing out a bullet deflector and it's actually my favorite part of the film, showing why Batman puts his life on the line over protecting his body with a fancy gadget. The animation is great but Bruce Wayne looks a little too feminine for my taste. Part four has Batman going up against Killer Croc and Scarecrow in the sewers of Gotham. It's a pretty cool segment, building on to that Scarecrow is still on the loose from ""Batman Begins"". Part five has an injured Batman finding all these guns in the sewer while recounting his training in India. Last, part six is Batman vs. Deadshot. Yeah that's part six in a nutshell. Other than the multitude of different anime styles, my other gripe is the continuity. The stories do have a small connection but it isn't enough for me to connect point A to point B. In chapter three, we see the Nolan Batmobile. Yet in chapter 5, we see the Burton Batmobile. This is where the movie failed in my opinion. Instead of having it stand on its own, like the others DCU films do, they try and present it as the ""middle story"" set in the universe of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. But other than a few references to Begins, the connection is lost. Like the animation style, they should've picked one story and developed it from there.

Anime is great for those who love it and everything but Batman and the other superheroes shouldn't, in my opinion anyway, be done that way. I wouldn't have minded it as much if it was just done in one style, but even then, I find following the action sequences a little hard to follow. All the fast cuts and characters jumping around make it dizzying and confusing. It's also a little distracting to go from one segment where Alfred is bald to another where he has a full head of hair. Batman (especially in parts 2, 3 and 6), Scarecrow and Deadshot look great while Killer Croc doesn't even remotely resemble anything from how he's been interpreted before. He looks like a glob of fat with fangs.

But what really makes this boring movie great is the voice cast. Everyone does great (though I pity Corey Burton as Scarecrow because I can barely understand anything he's saying) but the one who saves this is none other than Kevin Conroy, the undisputed voice of Batman. Since this was released in 2008, it had been a little over two years since Batman fans had heard him do the voice so when it was announced that he was doing it again, I was very excited. He really makes those lip flaps look like their mouths are forming actual words.

If it weren't for being a fan of the Batman character, I probably would've rented it over outright buying it but fortunately, out of the eight DCU films, this is the only one I really didn't like.",1279929600,,4462,4.444444444444445
3149398,3,B001614F0S,"Gotham Knight is worth watching for its animation style and character work with Batman, but it's far from a masterpiece.  The animation of Gotham City is a real treat, but Batman goes through a costume design kaleidoscope.  Some depictions are simple, others exuberant, and some are just far too bizarre for the Dark Knight.  There's some thoroughly silly anime moments here that just shatter the Batman feel.  In Deadshot, Batman deflects a bullet meant to assassinate Lieutenant Gordon by punching it.  In case you missed that, let me repeat myself: flying through the air and punching it.  Things like this make ""willing suspense of disbelief"" a little tough.  My wife agrees with me that Gotham Knight really shot itself in the foot by using the most bizarre story and animation in their opening feature, Have I Got a Story for You.
Bruce Wayne's journey is a uniquely fascinating one, but one scene with firearms (from Working Through Pain) is Batman portrayal at its lowest.  Character development is a wonderful thing for Batman, but only if it's good.  To conclude on Gotham Knight, I think promoting itself as a companion to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight was its biggest mistake.  You can't claim to support Christopher Nolan's Batman concept and then have him animated in such a stylized fashion and punching bullets out of the air.  It's still Batman, making Gotham Knight worth watching and automatically more interesting than the other superheroes, but it's also sloppy and a real mixed bag.  And with Batman, a ""mixed bag"" doesn't cut it.",1278720000,,1556,4.9423076923076925

The story follows the POV of three kids who see Batman throughout the day, and because each one sees him differently, the animated style is different. The storyline is juxtaposed with the art styles to get progressively more intense as the story goes on. It's based on the Animated Series, and Kevin Conroy (the original voice from the Animated Series) returns to do the voice of Batman in every segment.

Personally, I love it. As an art student, I am enamored with the entire movie. Of course there are styles that appeal to me more than others in certain segments, but it's interesting to see the different interpretations of Batman, Gotham, and the villains that terrorize it. I recommend this to any fans of animation and/or Batman.",1273190400,3,946,5.569444444444445
3149400,4,B001614F0S,"Batman:Gotham Knight was worth the bargain price I aquired it for.  If you get it around $15.99 then it turns out to be a good deal.  What you get is an orginal collaboration from different directors and writers that churns up a variety of results that may impress or dissapoint you.  Fact is, there's so much to see here that it ends up being worth the time.  Some scenes are much more boring than others, but the stories are very very good.  Most of the show is anime style art with traditional Batman scenerios.  If you like the idea of Batman in an anime world, then you most likely will enjoy Batman:Gotham Knight.

What I liked:  Incarnations of villains(Scarecrow was awesome), Episode ""Working through Pain"" (Favorite), Animation for the most part, different takes on Batman's costume, Semi-continuity, & Themes throughout the stories. I also very much enjoyed the special features.  We got lots of Batman history and villain commentary.  Original series episodes were fun.

What I disliked:  It may be that I'm not a die-hard Anime fan but the Animation is boring at times.  The Ramirez character did not connect with Nolan's Ramirez in The Dark Knight, even though they tried to make that connection.  First episode was a little jarring(My least favorite episode).  It also felt like it needed more choreographed action.

So all in all, I liked it.  I can see myself buying another animated Batman.  I can also see people disliking this ""compilation"" for it's disconnection with the traditional Batman.

3149402,4,B001614F0S,"OK. First, this compilation of movies is worth the money IF you completely remove the first two short movies...they are total waste of time. Bats doesn't even LOOK like himself but some blackish-blue mist (go figure) in the 1st one. The animation as well as the storyline in it is AWFUL(kids telling their version of what Bats did). In the second short, you don't even see him until the very end. But, I have to say when he FINALLY DOES make his appearance, skulls are cracked, noses are bleeding, the innocent are protected,justice is served and oh well...it's typical Bats.

Secondly,the animation in each story is markedly different. Anime is the defining thing here. 20-ish Bruce Wayne doesn't look like any Bruce Wayne I've ever seen before. But, lo and behold MR. Kevin Conroy is the voice cast as Bats throughout so all is right with the world as far as I am concerned.

The last 3 or 4 movies are violent and fast-moving. They range from his painful saw-my-parents-murdered-origins and showing how Bruce trained in another country to learn how to deal with physical pain to him going one-on-one via top of a racing subway train with a would-be assassin.

You also get 3-4 episodes from the '90's animated show. But, I was disappointed in the quality...colors were fuzzy, sounds were muffled...like they hadn't been remastered.

Is it worth the price tag? If you're a hardcore bats fan--- YES! If you're not, better stick with some of the Fox (1990's Batman; Adventures of..) and WB (2000's The Batman)on dvd.",1267920000,2,1516,4.819230769230769

3149404,1,B001614F0S,"This review is a warning for all parents.  I got this DVD as a free rental at Family Video in the children section.  IT IS DEFINITELY NOT A DVD TO BE VIEWED BY CHILDREN. Gunfights where blood is splattering all over the place.  One kid's description of a Batman fight where they show Batman cutting off his opponents head!

3149405,3,B001614F0S,"This movie was way over hyped as a bridge between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. While there are some of the same characters and it helps to establish Batman as Gotham's hero, it really doesn't have much of any direct ties to the movies. As much as I love Kevin Conroy's Batman from the animated series, I also thought he was miscast in this movie. The different art style and universe it's set in just feel like they should've gone with someone else.",1257033600,,455,4.428571428571429
3149406,3,B001614F0S,The whole story line of this I thought was good. You might want to watch it a second time though. The animation changes between 6 different artists during the movie. There were times I thought the animation of certain artists seemed very lazy. At certain points I was thinking that doesn't even look like batman it just looks like a fat guy in the suit. Nice thing about this I thought were special features (It had more special features of the 2-disc of Dark Knight). The thing I liked most about the special features is it had a few episodes of the Batman animated series from the 90's. If your around 19-23 it will bring ya back to those moments when you were little and that's always a good feeling. I just give it a 3 stars on the movie since it was short and I didn't like some of the animation (that's just an opinion though). I would rate the special features 5 stars. Definitely thought those special features were a win.,1255910400,,930,4.381502890173411
3149407,5,B001614F0S,"While Iron Man and Wolverine made some big news this summer with the trailers for their upcoming ""anime"" projects, the Caped Crusader beat them to the punch by about a year. Granted, anime-styled features like The Animatrix have come out before this, but Batman: Gotham Knight(which was the third DC Universe animated movie)acted like Dark Fury and Clone Wars which bridges the gap between two chapters of a franchise. It's supposed to happen after Batman Begins, and just before The Dark Knight, although it doesn't 100% fit into the given continuity of both films.

This movie is broken up into six segments, each one directed by an actual Japanese anime director. The first one shows some kids each telling their own version of running into Batman. Second has two Gotham City cops running into a gang war. Next is a very bishounen-looking Bruce Wayne donning a costume strait out of Gatchaman to test his own personal forcefield. Following that is a slight 2-parter of sorts where Batman heads into the sewers to take on Scarecrow and their own version of Killer Croc, which later has Bruce Wayne flashing back to when he was travelling the world and training. In the finale, Batman clashes with the sniper-for-hire, Deadshot.

Gotham Knight has some great comics writing from Brian Azzrello, Greg Rucka, and Bruce Timm. Some of the anime studios behind it were Production I.G.(Ghost In The Shell) and Madhouse(Vampire Hunter D). There is some very fine animation in this movie, and mostly worth getting for that alone. It's also bound to satisfy the average Bat-fan. The only real drawbacks to it are like the other DC Universe movies is that it was too short. I felt they could've added some more to each of the chapters, or at least maybe left out some of the chapters while making the others longer. It gives a good insight into the way the citizens of Gotham each view having a masked vigilante in their town, while at the same time showing how it is for Bruce Wayne to be Batman. It isn't necassary to see this in order to enjoy either of the Christopher Nolan movies, but you'd still have a thrillride at Bat-Time!",1253923200,,2124,4.753387533875339
3149408,4,B001614F0S,"Executive directors Toshi Himura and Bruce Timm collaborated to put together six short animated pieces on The Batman.  I was impressed with most (not all) of the animation and it was quite original.

Tying together the events between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, we explore first off what others consider the Batman is.  Is he a moving night shadow?  Something like The Man-Bat?  An invincible hero?

As the stories progress you see him as a dark, brooding man who is searching for answers and at best is groping for his basic purpose, something the writers give him in spades.

I don't want to write up all the credits and all the voice actors so as to keep this write-up short, but they all did a great job, many of them DC Comics writers.

Briefly:

""Have I Got a Story for You"" involves some teenager skateboard fiends who elaborate a bit on their adventures with The Batman.  Kinda cartoony for my taste.

""Cross-fire"" has the fictional character Crispus Allen, whom geeks will recall was the Spectre in the more recent comic books.  A police detective who does not trust that ""vigilante"" until he sees what The Bat can do.  The fire scene is particularly striking.

""Field Test"" checks out a new personal force shield, that is worn by the Bat with unpredictable results.

""In Darkness Dwells"" and ""Working Through Pain"" one could say are all one story, really.  Killer Croc attacks, under the spell of The Scarecrow's venomous gas that drives people nuts (as seen in Batman Begins).  Batman, bleeding to death in a gutter/sewer, recalls Cassandra, a woman who tries to help him find himself and ease his pain.  Did she succeed?

Finally, ""Deadshot"" and what a bad guy he is!  He is with a gun what Batman is without one.  They're so opposite and so alike, it's great.  The story and the action are non-stop and keeps you hanging.

In many ways Batman: Gotham Knight, though uneven at times, will delight the most discerning DC Comics fan or anyone who appreciates the Japanese and American animated art forms.

Features on the DVD include the ""sneak peek"" of the Wonder Woman DVD (which I liked a lot -- Amazons kicking butt), a trailer for The Dark Knight and an ad for the latest remastered Popeye cartoons.

3149409,5,B001614F0S,this dvd is about how batman got started. each of the different clips and stories are about 15-20 minutes long and could almost be a movie in and of themselves. each one shows batmans different pains and struggles physically and mentally; his evolution to where we see him on the BIG screen. the animation and sequences are a lot like animatrix or parts of kill bill.....so if you liked that....you'll love this!,1251072000,,412,4.736111111111111
3149410,5,B001614F0S,"First of all, I give this a 4 1/2. I rounded up because I really think this movie is getting the short end of the stick by too many people. You may have not liked the movie, but by far and away it was not a one star or even a two star. I think the most interesting part of this newly animated rendition of Batman is that you get to see 4 or 5 different perspectives on what Batman and Gotham look like. Its interesting and fun to see Batman animated in such distinct and creative ways. Story aside, I think most people who gave this movie horrible ratings are doing so because, for lack of a better word, they are fanboys- and the truth about fanboys and fangirls is that they have expectations in story and presentation that keep them from appreciating a little creativity. You may or may not enjoy every short story in this compilation, but I can guarantee that you will enjoy at least one and you should appreciate them all. My favorite piece was the ""Working Through the Pain"" segment. The writers really went into an introspective side of Batman that normal animated Batman just doesn't do. I have every animated Batman piece created and I can tell you that I love them all. This may not be the best one- though some may argue that it is, it is the most creative. Most non-fans who appreciate all medians of expressing art, most Batman fans and anyone looking to burn through an enjoyable hour, will not regret watching this.",1250208000,,1430,4.4

If you like a Animatrix style of short videos, this one is for you.  I am going to save my dollars for the eventual Dark Knight Returns animated film. I only hope Frank directs it and gets it right.

3149412,4,B001614F0S,"This came out when Dark Knight was rocking at the theaters.

it is an Excellent DVD!

as with the Animatrix it is a collection of storys rather than one complet movie. however all storys are linked up with each other.

i should warn you that this may not be suitible for some children, parents be aware.

keven conroy returnes as Batman. hes the best actor for the cartoon voice of batman!

i should add this animated story is NOT in the same 'universe' as the Batman animated seres, Batman Beyond, or JL.

but it does indeed use elements from batman begins and Dark knight.

""Have I got a stoy for you""
i felt this was the weakest story of the lot. basicly its how differant kids veiw batman, which has been done before.

""Crossfire""
this was a much better story, and I fealt it should have been the introduciton to this DVD. two cops take a prisoner to arkham and get into the crossfire of mob warfare. Batman has an excellent entrance! hes walking through a burning car and he just stands there!

(I should point out that the female cop is NOT montya. shes the same detective as in Dark knight. oddly the book version of this DVd calls her montya. but she isnt!)

""Feild Test""
a light story, but decent. Batman tests out a device with terrible consiquences.

""In Darkness Dwells""
this is one of my two favorite stories for this DVD.
batman goes underground to find the scarecrow and meets killer croc.
the art for this story was excellent.

""Working through the Pain""
continuing from the last story, batman is still in the sewers. hes recalling his training in India.

""Deadshot""
my second favorite story.
batman faces the gunman Deadshot.
more great animation.

however i fealt the ending was a bit weak or at least to open.
kinda left me wanting to know what happens next.
it didn't feel like it lead into Dark knight enough

however..
all in all it was a great DVD.
because its direct to DVD
it can be far darker than previous and current batman cartoons.

it was a great collection.
id love to see more like it.

the 2 disc verson offers episodes from Batman animated series.
with some great episodes.
""Legends"" (which is slightly similer to ""have i got a story for you' however its more of a tribute story) this story pays homage to batman storys from the 50s and 60s and also to Frank miller's Dark Knight. with a quick verbal refrance to Batman forever.
""Heart of Ice"" probly the most famous episode which reinvented Mr Freeze and made him a more interesting charture.
""I am the Night"" Gordon is shot and is being hunted down by a killer a very realistic story.
""over the Edge"" a differant story. i won't spoil it if u haven't seen it.

i very much enjoyed the documentarys.
""Batman and Me' which talks about Bob Kane.
""Villains' which overviews the various batman villains.

so all in all if ur a batman fan, like me, buy this dvd.",1248652800,,2842,4.483495145631068

This film looks like it was conceived and validated by a one million dollar computer without a trace of (or input from) a human hand. I don't know how anyone can believe that this is animation. We are becoming increasingly desperate in our entertainment choices, but I can't even classify this as entertainment. All of you illiterate and history-hating people probably do not comprehend the fact that this is NOT Batman, but is instead a true and unabashed perversion of the character (like those unmentionably bad Christopher Nolan films that tried to change and distort Batman into a ""realistic"" character). This DVD is shameful to say a polite word about it. This is not Batman; this is more like bad Japanese anime (and like all Japanese animated attempts, it lacks style, creativity, originality, and uniqueness). The ""stories"" here are not even stories, but are instead half-assed vignettes (something that illiterate people wouldn't notice). Watch ""Batman: The Animated Series"" if you want the REAL Batman. I will be discarding my copy of this dreck as soon as I can find someone to pay me for it. How sad that we have turned Batman into this drivelous insanity. A dark night indeed, folks.

The negatives of the DVD:  1) It automatically takes you to the six stories once the DVD is loaded into the Blu-ray player.  There is no option to view specific stories out of sequence.  2) Afterwards, you have to fast forward through the numerous versions of the FBI Warning translated in at least ten languages.  3) If you are familiar with Batman lore or know it as well as Bob Kane and Bill Finger, the remaining bonus features and commentaries (Wonder Woman DVD trailer excluded) are not worth seeing.

While I will always be a fan of Batman, I can only recommend this to the die-hard fans.  For people that want to see Batman animated; but do not know which DVDs to buy, I would suggest first seeing Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm.  Then I would see Batman:  Mystery of the Batwoman.

It's a sham because you buy it to watch something on Batman but you're fooled into watching six over-stylized Japamation versions of an American icon, AND that being said, this DVD makes a mockery of the Dark Knight.
-  Since when and in who's mind is Batman a neutured metrosexual, a monster, or a referee between mobsters. This dvd is all that is wrong with the animee style of animation. Feminine men who even look like women, unbelievable over-exaggerated action scenes, and annoying dialog. Dont get me wrong... I do like some animee (Akira, Ghost in a Shell, Appleseed, Princess Monokee) but not this type ala television animee.

I thought it would be this dark adult animated movie that I would find really gripping and entertaining. I saw it in blockbuster one day when I was with one of my friends so I decided to buy it. Maybe my expectations were too high but I was slightly disappointed.
It isn't one long movie. It's a movie in six sections and it is done by different anime artists. Some of the styles I liked, some disliked. I guess that is just a preference of opinion. But some of the separate stories I found a little  bit predictable. The first one is okay. It didn't really do anything for me and I didn't particularly love the style. In some of the other stories, certain aspects seemed somewhat awkward and batman just suddenly appears in a very odd places. I don't want to give too much away but there was one side story that was a bit interesting. It went back into his past when he was still training to become batman. I really loved the style of the last section of the story but I thought there would be more to the bad guy.

The writers and animators should be ashamed of this work. I would not have my name on it.",1223424000,,399,3.925925925925926
3149440,3,B001614F0S,"I saw this feature on Cartoon Network and while I felt it had potential, it didn't live up to it. It didn't totally suck but definitely not as good as it could've been.

I didn't mind that it was in anime as I am a fan of that style of animation but the first story definitely sucked! The stories progressively got better as the feature went on with the final story called ""Deadshot"" being the best of the bunch! I also liked the one with the Scarecrow and I did like how they tied the features together.

Overall, not a bad buy but I'd wait to get it for under $10 or something. I wouldn't pay full price for this!",1223424000,,615,4.116666666666666
3149441,4,B001614F0S,"I caught Batman Gotham Knight on Cartoon Network and I was very impressed. Similar to the Animatrix in format, it gives a sample of some of today's top animators' vision of the Dark Knight. More importantly, it echoes the sincerity, psychology and grit of the Nolan films, and that's where the character really shines. Made for promotion of last summer's The Dark Knight, Batman Gotham Knight follows the continuity of Batman Begins, including characters Scarecrow and Jim Gordon (plus a really cool, though brief take on Killer Croc). The return of Kevin Conroy voicing Batman/Bruce Wayne is really the icing on the cake.

The saddest thing about the history of Batman is the seemingly unavoidable marketing campiness that pops up every few years. This set of anime shorts really show what animated Batman should be - a mature, deep psychological analysis of what is essentially a psychopath redeemed only by his unfailing sense of justice. If only Warner would greenlight a serious Batman anime series like this!

The first chapter is a rehash of an old Animated Series episode called ""Legends of the Dark Knight."" It's worth skipping, but the rest are outstanding. ""In Darkness Dwells"" and ""Working Through Pain"" are worth owning this set alone.

Initially I had passed on Batman Gotham Knight when it was released, due to its similarity to the Animatrix. But after watching it last weekend, I have to have this DVD set to add to my collection.",1223251200,,1447,4.946502057613169
3149442,4,B001614F0S,"These are my reviews for each segment
HAVE I GOT A STORY FOR YOU 2 Stars out of five **
The weakest of the whole segments, a very strange kind of animation, looks like the Adam west's batman, a little overweight and one thing that bugs me the most is that batman seems to have great difficulty beating one clumsy weak villain during the whole segment

CROSSFIRE 3 and a half Stars out of Five *** 
Nice visual style, Batman looks more menacing and bulky than ever, great action sequences

FIELD TEST  3 stars out of five ***
Batman looks like the Phantom of the Paradise in this segment, not much to tell about this segment, Lucius gives to batman a  new device that can disperse bullets, but batman soon realize the risks of the collateral damage of this new device

IN DARKNESS DWELLS 5 Stars out of five ****
The best segment of all, Batman looks menacing, it shows great detective skills, a fierce attitude, the city looks like blade runner, the sewers are terrific, the story is strong, the action blows your mind, the scarecrow and the killer crook are menacing than ever. And yes Batman looks like the one from the Tim Burton's Movies

WORKING THROUGH PAIN ***
Batman crawling and suffering in deep pain for the whole segment, while he has back flashes about his experiences in India when he was learning how to deal with pain, not my favorite one tough many people like it

DEADSHOT 4 and a Half stars out of five ****1/2
One of the best segments of the bunch, Batman fighting against a merciless sniper, the animation of this segment compete with the ""In Darkness dwell"" segment, a very frantic confrontation between batman and dead shot.",1223251200,2,1647,4.559322033898305
3149443,2,B001614F0S,"About the only thing that can be said in favor of this film is that the animation is often striking and beautiful. Otherwise, it suffers from all the defects of the animated series after Warner Bros. decided to turn it into a marketing gimic.

The animated series as developed by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and others was great, but once Warner Bros. realized they had a success they had to milk it for all the money they could: rework it for a younger audience, make it lighter, less dark and less intelligent.

Gotham Knight is dark, but for the most part only in the visual sense. The story line is almost indecipherable -- pointless twists and turns, jumps -- a mess.

The characters are superficial as is the annoying philosophizing.

Someone like Alan Moore can pull this off. But Warner Bros. can destroy his work and they destroy whatever might have been good in Gotham Knight.",1223078400,,880,4.621794871794871
3149444,1,B001614F0S,"WoW.. this series of 6 short, and i mean short cartoons blows..
1 ""Have I Got A Story For You""- The animation is equal to the crap you find on cartoon network as of late ""Dexter's laboratory"" ""ed edd and eddie"".. that kinda crap. The cgi used for the backgrounds were well done and the sound track was alright. But when I buy an animation I like to enjoy the quality of the artwork. The story line was dumb I thought
2 ""Crossfire""- The animation was much much better but the color of the short was so dark it was hard to see the picture even after adjusting the contrast color brightness etc. It gave me the feel from the spawn series from HBO. Good story line but again crappy art. Now do not misunderstand me I know Batman is a ""dark"" character who creeps in the night. I'm not a major fan but even if it takes place at nite and in shadows the viewer should still be able to see what is happening. There is a big difference between crappy art and being dark art.
3 Field Test"" Was probably the best short. With animation similar to the japanimation in my collection I could now focus on the story fully. Again nice backgrounds and an interesting story.
4 ""In Darkness Dwells"" Was a mildly entertaining short. Again great city scenes and backgrounds. But poor character animation AND it was dark in some parts. Shadows on a persons face shouldn't be giant triangles of pure black.
5 ""Working through the Pain""- Had good art work but I found the story line to be less interesting then the others. It was more of a lame flash back character development short.
6 ""Deadshot""- This story was among the best on this collection as well. Clean animation with great city scenes and an interesting story to follow.

I think that the last episode was likely the best of the bunch, but it's a real shame I sat through all the other ones to get there. The snippets are interesting enough, but the presentation is a little discombobulated and readjusting to the changes in animation gets a little annoying after a while. Now I realize that there are some who will read this and say ""well, duh, different directors..."" but you know I watched the Animatrix and really enjoyed that, but this was something wholly different and likely should have been a rental rather than a purchase. Just my two cents...",1220832000,2,638,4.705357142857143

3149449,1,B001614F0S,"Being a pretty big batman fan is what led me to purchase this DVD.  A few of the shorts showed promise, but were ultimately doomed to extinction.  The different renderings of batman showed talent, but I like the main character to look the same at least for some duration.  The same goes for the plots.  Although they were loosely tied together (very loosely), the continuity was lost throughout the shorts.  I think they should have picked one of these six designs and developed a substantial plot that batman fans could enjoy.  Completely absent was the detective-like appeal that batmans fans have come to expect.

So, if you're a hardcore batman fan, you may want to pick this up but don't expect much except a sketchbook rendition of a hero who deserves much more.  Otherwise, don't bother - it's just not worth the utter disappointment.

3149450,2,B001614F0S,"The stories in this DVD are very weak. It seems like the producers etc. concentrated their creativity on style rather than actually storyline, plot etc.

The animation is kind of cool and interesting (although I liked the MTV Spiderman a little bit better) but the stories were short and lacked any substance. Also, with each episode only being 12 minutes there wasn't a lot of time to develop a story. Yes, each episode kind of builds on each other. However, overall I think this DVD was rushed a little bit to come out at the same time as the movie.

Speaking of the Dark Night.... I've read tons of stuff on how that movie probably should have been rated R if that's the case then this DVD should be rated NC-17. I think the PG13 rating was way too kind. With the gory showing of decapitations, people being blown away and blood being splattered all over the place it was just sickening. The producers of this DVD would have been better spent concentrating on their story and plot development instead of of worrying how can I annimate this guy getting his head blown off. Totally a discusting amount of gore!

Overall, if you'r curious about this DVD get it from the library. Don't pay for it. It's not that good unless you're into watching creapy and bloody animation with little story and sub par plots.",1220313600,5,1308,4.5574468085106385

3149454,5,B001614F0S,One of the best DC animated series by far. This is how Batman should be. The stories tied together different aspects of how Batman evolved.

The story features six interlocking Batman tales, some of which tie into the current movie series while others tie into the the comic books. The only detraction is that some of the animated characters who appear in the Dark Knight movie were not designed to look like their movie conterparts.
Some great writing and outstanding animation set this DVD apart. The extras are decent, but only worth buying if you do not own the Batman Animated seires DVDs since the second DVD feaures four of those episodes, execellent though they are.

3149460,5,B001614F0S,"Batman:Gothem Night is an admition that yes, we now know that there is an older crowd, a more grown-up market out there for this animation and maybe we can tap into that. It is also a declaration that this older crowd also expects more than the typical Saturday morning stuff they see when they walk by the kids in the living room after breakfast. This telling of Batman was split into 6 parts, telling in many way how The Batman came to gain som eof the discipline to be the Dark Night he is now and showed us a few villians that we don't usually see. This is NOT a movie for the kids, this is and may not be the Batman that everyone rememebrs but, for me, the important thing to rememeber is the look, the feel, the textures, the richness of the animation. It is such a welcome treat to see the Japanese Anime' twist all over this movie. It cleary stands alone as far as the Batman animated movies thus far.",1219536000,,909,4.2298850574712645

No matter the Oscar postmortem for Heath Ledger (who made a correct incarnation of the Joker, a character which is practically impossible to act, but not as much as the reviews says), this episodes demonstrate once again that, no matter the live actor movies lift up the bar, the animators can lift the bar a little bit more.

I like the no holds bar approach of the Japanese not being afraid to show bad guys getting whacked but Batman should never be seen killing anyone directly. The ridiculous blood splatter and flashing fight scenes need to be toned down because this is still a deeply rooted America hero, what I am saying is do not completely erase that American feel.

Over all I like the anime idea; still some episodes were a waste of time some were awesome, all anime in its violence and conceited character images not much of an American feel other than the great Kevin Conroy.",1219017600,,824,4.486666666666666

i liked most of all if they where was a batman 3 some of the ideas could possibly make it in the third film like the batmobile upgraded look somewhat longer sleeker batwings on the backside of the car and deadshot if he was to be introduced into the batman film his costuem could be simaler to what he wore in this dvd.

The idea is exciting, but DC should have stuck with one anime director and artistic style to keep a cohesive flow to the film.  The writing is actually pretty good and the character development for Bruce Wayne & Detectives Ramirez/Allen is acceptable, but it just feels unsettling to watch it in varying episodes.

Also, Kevin Conroy does a good job not just using his Batman:TAS voice, but I still feel they should have gone with a younger actor to give this project its own continuity.

I wasn't even going to buy it, but Target offered it with Batman Beyond: The Movie added on to the disc, which made it worth the price.

First the good:
* The DVD's do serve as a good bridge between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.
* Kevin Conroy does his usual excellent job as Batman's voice.
* The voice talent in general does an excellent job.
* The backgrounds and equipment designs are beautifully done.

Now the bad: The characters are illustrated so poorly that it looks like the majority of the art budget was blown on the backgrounds. The teenagers in the first episode, for example, look like they were drawn by an artist using a half-melted ice sculpture as his reference. The quality of the character animation and illustration does NOT improve as the series progresses.

Though not as poorly drawn as The Batman TV series, the apparent lack of effort put into illustrating the characters destroys all my enjoyment for this DVD series. It's too bad, because the voice talent, background illustrations, and storylines are all excellent.",1218412800,,959,4.907407407407407

It's actually worth watching through once or twice to get an idea of the expanding universe of the Batman series.  However, this planned trilogy really stands on its own as it has no relation to the graphic novels of latter years.  No parrallel universes nor joker in sight, but the gritty reality and dark themes that it sets to deliver flow well.  This is a good transition between the first movie and into the second one.

However, some of the animations, were not my cup of tea.  I think I'm being nitpicky about just one of them.  (I'm afraid you will know it when you see it) However, it doesn't remove from the actual presentation as it a side story of sorts and has no really backstory to aid.

3149480,5,B001614F0S,"I first saw the commercial for this upcoming release on Adult Swim and since I'm into marvel and superhuman stuff that I would check out batman, originally I had seen lots of batman movies and the batman cartoon on some cartoon channel and I enjoy anything with the Dark Knight.

Now Batman has returned in a tale that shows how he transformed from novice crime fighter and into the Dark Knight, and the action and animation are excellent here! I found this 6 part film to be really dark for what I remember of Batman. Personally I feel as if it pays good homage to the dark knight as I remember but with a darker more sinister look into him and seeing crime as it really is.

I wasn't let down and I enjoyed every minute of it, especially the speculation from the youths in the beginning of the story. the only thing I would have wanted was a real plot. Since it's reminiscent of most cartoon series in how it tells a short story in each, it didn't exactly follow a major plot throughout them all aside from a mission to mission sorta thing. All in all I still enjoyed this and recommend it to anyone whom in not a super batman freakazoid that is obsessed since some people just can't seem to enjoy it, people are too picky these days.

It is a kind of companion piece to Nolan's films though not meant to have any continuity with them. I'm not really into anime but still thoroughly enjoy this.

It plays on the Scarecrow a touch, and attempts to address Mr. Fox's involvement a bit more...an effort to fill some gaps between 'Begins' and 'Dark Knight.'  It just doesn't fill enough of the gaps, and certainly leaves a GAPING hole in any of the background of the Joker or Harvey Dent.  Also...the six different directorial styles are different enough (particularly the first chapter), that although the stories seem to have continuity...all of it adds up to a whole bunch of nothing.

Gotham Knight tries to do the same thing for Batman, but doesn't quite succeed. Its a lot shorter than the Animatrix was, and much less solid throughout. The movie starts out pretty weak with a lame reinterpretation of the ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" episode of the classic '90s animated series, in which some kids compare their exaggerated tales of what Batman is like. The next few episodes were okay, but the whole thing felt pretty lifeless until the last two episodes. The first of which, ""Working Through Pain"", was very interesting and had a sorrowful note to it. The final episode, ""Deadshot"", was the best by far. It's telling that the animation in this episode looks the most like an American comic book. Let's face it: not everything was meant to be anime. The fact that four episodes of Batman: The Animated Series were included on the second disc makes this all the more obvious.

""Field Test"" has Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne working on the latest invention for Batman as he fights against a gang of criminals on a boat near Gotham Harbor, ""In Darkness Dwells"" has our hero pitting himself against Killer Croc and The Scarecrows in the sewers. ""Working Through Pain"" has Batman wounded as he remembers his past in Asia where he is trained on how to live with pain from a East Indian woman and finally ""Deadshot"" has a top assassin who is willing to kill for a prophet until the Dark Knight stops him.

A wonderful American/Japanese animated anthology that fills in some of the gaps of the ending to ""Batman Begins"" and starts way before ""The Dark Knight"" in Nolan's universe. The film has six directors from Japan and the stories are written by David Goyer (""Batman Begins"", ""Blade 2""), Josh Olson (""A History of Violence"") and Alan Burnett (""Batman The Animated Series"") with Bruce Timm as one of the executive producers with animation from Warner, Madhouse and Production IG.

Averaging at about 11 minutes each the stories are just too short to really make an impression and a couple of them end abruptly much to the annoyance of the viewer.

Kevin Conroy returns as the voice of Batman (this will come as a great relief to fans who have had to put up with Rino Romano's voice in the new, inferior series) but there's none of the wild invention seen in the 90s TV series or any of the subsequent feature-length movies. Each story seems to have one idea and sticks with it to the bitter end whether it works or not. It would have been better if they connected the stories and built towards a better end.

As a movie it fails. As a sequence of quick adventures leading up to The Dark Knight it kinda works. The animation is pretty and I'd like to see more but give us more depth next time, Warner.

The Blu Ray features a 1.85:1 1080p picture that isn't amazing but still manages to impress depending on the animation style of the particular adventure. The first being the worst and the last being the best. There is also a DD+ soundtrack which works just fine and quite a lot of extras.

There's a nice bit of editorial cohesion between the chapters, too, as a small plot point in one story will show up in a bigger way in another story, that sort of thing.  As other reviewers have pointed out, however, contrary to some descriptions this is not a kind of ""bridging"" DVD that connects Christopher Nolan's first Batman film with his second; this is just a nice little side project that tells a few extra Batman stories using the more serious, complex flavor of the Nolan films.  The animation ranges from pleasantly stylish (the initial story with the skateboarding kids) to sit-up-and-take-notice breathtaking (the concluding ""Deadshot"" chapter), with nothing sloppy or sub-par in sight.

I bought the single-disc edition of ""Batman: Gotham Knight"", which has a few modest special features, but nothing like past single-disc versions of recent direct-to-DVD DC animated films.

With that said, from the perspective of one who has followed Batman and is familiar with the character's evolution over the past 10 years, this feature was mediocre and disappointing.

On the positive side, the animation and sound (including voice acting) was superb.  However, in my opinion the lack of any compelling plotline or character insight/development will always overshadow good video or audio.  Furthermore, for those looking for some connection between the two movies by Chris Nolan, you won't find any of significance.

The mishmash of stories and directors in the DVD Batman Gotham Knight failed to engage me because there's no coherent transition from one short story to another.

The marketing campaign for this DVD claimed that it would fill in the gaps between the two movies.

Anime fans will like to see Batman illustrated in new and interesting ways. And trust me some of the art is very, very good. However, there's just not enough story here to engage most adults.

Please go back to your sewing circles or try to inform potential buyers on the validity of the product, not if your child can grasp the material or understand adult material (what a pointless exercise.) Compared to most things on TV, this DVD is tame.

On to the DVD: people are trying to compare Gotham Knight to the new movie without merit. Like the Animatrix series before, this animated series only adds to the wealth of movie and video and material on the character. Also like the Animatrix, it follows suit by having American scripts collaborate with Japanese animators and techniques, no doubt to cash in on wider markets. I will admit the stories are not as well written compared to the Animatrix. Some of the shorts are either slow-moving, or when an exciting short starts to get going, it ends too abruptly. A wiser  move by the creators would have been to try and create a more seamless story that connected all the stories much like the Clone Wars series did or cut a few of he 7 stories and broaden the remaining ones.

If you are a fan of Batman and the whole mythology around it you will enjoy the DVD--if you are just a fan of the comics or the movies you might not enjoy some parts. It helps to watch the new Christopher Nolan movie to appreciate the sum of the parts but it is not necessary. In other words, judge for yourself because these shorts are worth at least a rent.

The real gem of this collection is Disc 2, in particular the documentaries on the rogues gallery of Batman and a brief history of Bob Kane. Some real interesting people are interviewed, such as Mark Hamil and Stan Lee, to eulogize on Kane and his quirks. It is interesting to note that Batman was crafted after Da Vinci's flying model and that Kane basked in the spotlight as his character's creator, mentioning, ""The creator of Batman"" often when introducing himself. A concise history of villains establishes the fact a great hero is only defined by his villains, and each is an alter-ego of the main hero. Along with a revealing Wonder Woman animated clip, Disc 2 is worth the few extra dollars.",1217116800,,2240,4.537128712871287
3149506,4,B001614F0S,"Batman: Gotham Knight (DVD)-
Being dubbed ""The Animatrix"" of the Batman movies, this compilation couldn't have a better comparison. Just as The Animatrix fit in-between the first and second Matrix movies, this one fits between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. There are six stories by six separate anime creators. And again, just as The Animatrix, some stand out more than others. Oh, and Kevin Conroy of Batman: The Animated Series, Justice League, and, well, basically every time you've heard Batman in an animated show in the last 15 years (except for Justice League: New Frontier), Kevin Conroy is who you've heard.

1) ""Have I Got a Story for You"" - This first one probably has the most awkward look out of all of them but it seems to fit with the style of story being told. I've read comparisons with this story to one called ""Tales of the Dark Knight"" which was part of the Adventures of Batman and Robin series. Personally, I don't remember that episode but instead it reminded me of an early Batman: The Animated Series episode called "" P.O.V."" where three of Batman's villains tell a story about Batman from their own point of view. In this story it's some kids who do the storytelling and each telling gives us a freakish view of what they think Batman really is. It's got some interesting designs for Batman as we go from retelling to retelling but I thought overall it was just ok.

2) ""Crossfire"" - This was one of my favorite ones mainly because of the style. It was more realistic and I loved the set up for this one. We see Lt. Gordon helping Batman deal with some of the remaining crime bosses. A pair of Gotham detectives literally get caught in the crossfire of a shoot-out between two crime factions. One of the selling points for me in this one is a beautiful shot of Batman overlooking Gotham which seems to be inspired by a Jim Lee drawing he did during his Batman run a couple of years ago. The fight between Batman and the two factions is also a lot of fun to watch.

3) ""Field Test"" - The style for this one is ""softer"" than the others. The design for Bruce Wayne especially seems very effeminate and it's the first time Kevin Conroy's voice doesn't seem to match the character design. And they take some major liberties with Batman's costume in this one giving the cowl an almost bird-like beak. The plot, though, is interesting as we see Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman's character from the movies) develop a new technology that will make Batman ""bulletproof"". When a thug accidentally gets wounded because of the new technology, Batman makes an interesting choice concerning this technology that could make his crime-fighting abilities almost superhuman.

4) ""In Darkness Dwells"" - This is another one that has a style that is very warped but they seem to play it off a bit on the fact that Scarecrow is in this segment and he's dealing out his fear toxin again. We get an appearance from Killer Croc in this one and I like the origin they give him. The style makes this one very creepy looking and we get a good story featuring two of Batman's best rogues.

5) ""Working Through Pain"" - The animation in this one has it's own style but leans more towards the realistic like ""Crossfire"" did. We get to see how Bruce Wayne learned how to deal with pain. It is an very brutal journey that shows us why fighting those guys in the prison camp at the beginning of Batman Begins was no big deal compared to what he dealt with in this story.

6) ""Deadshot"" - The title of this one, in all it's simplicity, tells us all we need to know. It's immediately evident why they saved this one for last. Yes, I'm going to say it, this DVD ends with a bang! Ok, I got it out of my system. But there's no other way to describe it. This is from Madhouse studios whose style is very similar to Ninja Scroll (I couldn't determine if they had actually worked on Ninja Scroll or not). I've never known much about the villain Deadshot but they sure make him out to be a major threat here. He and Batman have some very intense battles and it almost leaves you wishing that all 6 six stories where done by these guys. I mean, no offense to the other creators but this last one was just awesome!

I don't know how much this will actually enhance your viewing of The Dark Knight but regardless you should check this out for some great anime that also feature everyone's favorite Dark Knight detective.",1217030400,,4399,4.49125

3149509,1,B001614F0S,"I'm a huge fan of the Batman: New Animated series as well as the original live action movie and the Dark Knight. So I saw this on amazon and thought ""Gee its Batman, you can't screw up Batman"". Man was I wrong.

1) The artwork is awful. Yes, I get that its supposed to be Manga-like. In the end its complete crap. I mean, its like a room of 6-year olds got together to draw Batman and somebody said, ""Hey lets use THAT"". Shadows are over done, angles all wrong, proportions goofed. Its like Salvador Dali suddenly got a job as a comic book artist.

2) Animation is choppy, the framerate seemed very low. I mean, I actually checked my DVD player thinking it was broken. Nope, the DVD is just choppy, 4 frames per sec, like watching a flip book on crack.

3) Bruce Wayne is neither Mr. Spock nor some doe-eyed reject from the Robotech series. Sheesh, worst rendition ever.

4) Disjointed plot. Yeah, I get it, 6 stories all linked. Cooool. NOT. It was like someone held a high school plot writing contest and the kids used all the same campy themes you'd expect from a bunch of hacks. Some cops hate Batman, some like him. Batman is human, lets see him work thru pain, Batman, he's on a mission. Wow, this is DEEP STUFF. Riiiight.

Had I not paid for this I would have turned it off. I was RELIEVED when it was over. This isn't just bad, its truly terrible. It pains me to say this because I really love animation (Justice League, Superman, and some of the Marvel works as well). I'm sure there are some freaky fanboys out there hopped up on the Scarecrow's joy juice who will ""love the gritty nature of the 'gotham knight'"". Personally you'd find more entertainment, folding your $13 dollars into a facsimile of Batman and running around the room with it. It is THAT BAD.",1216944000,15,1770,4.384146341463414

I had, however, high hopes for Gotham Knights. Its Batman after all. I'm not a big fan of Japanimation but was looking forward to the different visionaries taking on the project. The result was less than stellar. Stories are too short and the first handful move slowly, it barely features Batman (from his point of view at least) enough, it is a Batman film afterall, the look of Batman in some of the designs is pretty blah. The fight scenes are non-existent. Very disappointed overall. The last episode with Deadshot was good, however way too short. How does this film fit into the Nolan-verse of Batman?

3149511,5,B001614F0S,"I have now watched the DVD movie GOTHAM KNIGHTS twice and I have to say that not only does it bear watching more than once, I think it needs more than one viewing to really appreciate all that it holds.  The 6 chapters DO hold together much better than some of the reviewers have said and yet each episode or chapter also can stand by itself.  It also builds a bridge from the film BATMAN BEGINS to the new one, THE DARK KNIGHT, but again, it is a subtle bridge and can be enjoyed all on its own.  It also builds a bridge of sorts between the comic book Batman and the film version.

The animation is breathtaking in parts and works well throughout to tell the story (stories).

It is very interesting and a great device to have the great Kevin Conroy voicing Batman (and of course, Bruce Wayne) throught all 6 chapters. It brings continuity since the animation style changes from episode to episode. And all the voice acting throughout was wondeful. It was cool having David McCallum (of MAN FROM UNCLE fame), playing Alfred the Butler, and he did a superb job.  And it is always nice to hear actors like Corey Burton and George Newburn, regulars in DCU animation doing various characters throughout.

 I liked all 6 chapters, but my favorite was ""Working Through Pain"".  This one had a lot of resonance for me beyond the story.  For lack of a better way of saying it, it was the most ""spiritual"" of the stories (and not only because of the setting in India!)

I highly recommend this for true Batman fans (and IMHO, those the ones who are flexible and understand how flexible and diverse the character can be).

3149514,2,B001614F0S,"I'd seen this DVD advertised lately, coinciding the period that the movie ""The Dark Knight"" hit theaters (which I have already seen, and is an amazing film).
Being a fan of Batman, I was excited to rent this. The advertisements stated some of the writers of ""The Dark Knight"" were involved in this, and upon looking the cast over at my local Blockbuster, my excitement grew when I saw that Bruce Timm (one of the Executive Producers of the Batman: The Animated Series cartoon) was involved, and Batman himself was being voiced by Kevin Conroy (the voice of Batman in said series).
Now, I have a lot of respect for Batman: The Animated Series. It was often done really well, even for a 30 minute cartoon. It could be a little grown up, but without being too harsh for kids to watch. And personally, Kevin Conroy voicing Bruce Wayne/Batman is one of my favorite incarnations of the character, along with Christian Bale as the current big screen Batman. I'll even go as far as to say the writers of said series should have been the ones to write the 90's era Batman movies.
And now we come to Batman: Gotham Knight. This DVD was a big letdown. It indeed is six Batman stories. ""Interlocking"" is not a word I'd use to describe them though (as the ads promoted ""Six interlocking stories""). More like, casually related to. If at all. For instance, one story involves Batman fighting off some gangs, one of which is a Russian gang. In another, Batman stops a gang fight (one of the gangs being Russian), and establishes for them which one stays on what turf, since he doesn't have the evidence to put away either of them yet. That's about as far as the stories are related.
They're short (about 12 to 15 my guess), and thus there isn't much time to cover a lot of ground. Some stories might have been worthwhile if they had been given enough time develop, and had more story to add.
Bruce Timm and Alan Burnett (also from the Animated Series) may have been involved, but this is certainly not their best work.
And while I really like Kevin Conroy as Batman in said series, his voice doesn't fit in here. Basically, Bruce Wayne is supposed to be younger here, and the animation reflects that. Conroy's voice simply doesn't sound right coming from this cartoon. It just doesn't fit. He's a lot better as a middle aged or older Batman.
Another thing to note: it appears that this was meant to be a series of in between stories after Batman Begins, but before The Dark Knight. Hmmm....
Just like different writers were given the task of writing the episodes, it appears that different animators were given the task of animating them. The art varies, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's just plain awful (I'm thinking specifically of the first story, where characters are drawn somewhat plumpy looking, with slender limbs).
Well, what else can I say? This just doesn't have a very well done feel to it. More like Warner Brothers said ""Hey, we've got this new Batman movie hitting theaters in the summer, make us a bunch of crappy cartoons so we can sell them direct to video and make some more money"".
Maybe ""crappy"" is a bit of a strong word. But that's my opinion. A couple of these stories, if fleshed out better and given more time, could have been decent (maybe even great?), but it all falls flat.
I would have preferred that they instead come out with another direct to DVD movie based on the Animated Series, and given us one whole movie, with Bruce Timm and co. making it, and given some free reign over it. Or maybe even a stand alone story set in it's own continuity. Or even the Batman Begins continuity. But these shorts just don't cut it. I'm sorry.
Personally, I'm glad I rented this and didn't all out buy it. I simply cannot recommend this one, not to casual or hardcore fans, unless you are completely obsessed with Batman and must own every single movie, cartoon, ect..
But for me, the most entertaining this on this DVD was watching the ads for The Dark Knight (which I already saw. Sad that the ads for a movie I already saw are more interesting than the actual movie from the disc they're from), and a sneak peek at a new Wonder Women movie coming out next year.",1216771200,5,4172,4.527152317880795

Here are complete synopses of the six stories (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!)

Have I Got A Story For You (Studio 4C)

Written by Josh Olson. A street kid meets with three of his friends at a skate park. All three of them claim to have seen Batman earlier that day. Batman's battle with the Man in Black, a high-tech criminal, is told in reverse chronological order, with three very different interpretations of Batman's form and abilities: one describes him as a living shadow that can melt away and reappear at will (similar to Vampire Batman), another describes him as a half-bat, half-man creature (similar to Man-Bat), and one describes him as a combat robot called RoBat. At the end, Batman pursues the Man in Black to the skatepark, and captures him with the help of the fourth street kid. The fourth kid is able to see what Batman truly is after seeing him sustain injuries from the battle: a warrior in a Batsuit. He proceeded to tell his experience to his friends after Batman disappeared. Though the film credits give ""story by"" acknowledgment to first-time writer Jordan Goldberg, Josh Olsen acknowledged it was actually based on a very similar story by Frank Robbins called ""The Batman Nobody Knows""[5]. The story was first printed in Batman #250 in 1973, and subsequently adapted as ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" in the original Batman: The Animated Series. According to Olsen: ""The first time it's stealing, the second time it's borrowing, the third time you're creating a genre,"".[6]

 Crossfire (Production I.G.)

Written by Greg Rucka. Crispus Allen and Anna Ramirez are partners and members of the Major Crimes Unit that have been hand-picked by James Gordon. The two are assigned to take the recently captured Man in Black (captured during Have I Got A Story For You), revealed to be Jacob Feely, an escaped inmate from Arkham Asylum with an expertise in advanced electronics and explosives, to the Narrows to be incarcerated. On their way, they argue over whether Batman can be trusted, with Allen saying that they're just running errands for a vigilante, while Ramirez replies that Batman has changed Gotham for the better. As they are heading back, Allen declares his intention to leave the MCU, and Ramirez pulls into a vacant lot to confront Allen. However, the two get caught in a confrontation between gangs, The Russian and Sal Maroni. Maroni's men are gunned down, and Maroni takes refuge behind Allen and Ramirez's patrol car, which The Russian subsequently destroys with a rocket launcher. Ramirez and Maroni manage to get clear in time, while Allen is rescued by Batman, who proceeds to take out The Russian and his men. Maroni then threatens to kill Ramirez, but he, too, is dispatched by Batman. Batman recognizes Allen and Ramirez as Gordon's hand-picked officers, remarks that Gordon is a good judge of character, and disappears.

 Field Test (Bee Train)

Written by Jordan Goldberg. An accident involving a new WayneCom satellite's gyroscopic electromagnetic guidance system gives Lucius Fox an idea for a device that will electromagnetically deflect small-arms fire. Bruce Wayne takes the device and attends a charity golf tournament being held by developer Ronald Marshall, with whom he discusses the mysterious death of a woman, Teresa Williams, who had opposed some of Marshall's plans. During the tournament, Wayne secretly takes Marshall's PDA device. Later that night, as Batman, he hijacks a boat owned by Sal Maroni and drives it alongside a boat owned by rival gang leader The Russian and proceeds to attack both gangs at once, with assistance from his new device. He attempts to force a truce between the two gang leaders until he can get evidence against them, but is disrupted when one of Maroni's men fires at him. The bullet deflects and instead hits one of The Russian's men. Distressed, Batman takes the injured man to the hospital. Later, he returns the device to Fox, stating that the device works too well, and that he is willing to put his life on the line, but no one else's.

 In Darkness Dwells (Madhouse)

Written by David S. Goyer. The police respond to a riot in a cathedral where Cardinal O'Fallon was giving a sermon. According to eyewitness testimony, the Cardinal was abducted by a large lizard-monster and taken down into the crypts below the cathedral. Lieutenant Gordon, Crispus Allen, and Anna Ramirez investigate; Gordon has a brief conversation with Batman, who agrees with Gordon's theory that the Scarecrow's fear toxin is behind the riot as the doctor has been at large since the riot at the Narrows (during the event of Batman Begins). Batman gives Gordon an earpiece that will allow them to stay in contact and descends below ground, trying to find Cardinal O'Fallon and his abductor. A homeless man living in an abandoned subway station identifies the abductor as Killer Croc. Batman and Gordon briefly discuss the villain's past, but are cut off when Killer Croc himself shows up, under the influence of the fear toxin, and attacks Batman. Batman defeats him, but not before sustaining a bite that transfers some of the toxin to him. He then finds Cardinal O'Fallon being put on trial and sentenced to death by the Scarecrow, who is unhappy with O'Fallon's efforts to help the homeless. Batman leaps in to defend the Cardinal. Using the methane already present in the room, he sparks an explosion that destroys several water pipes, flooding the area and allowing him to escape with the Cardinal. Gordon appears in a helicopter to retrieve the Cardinal and offers to help Batman as well, but Batman refuses, saying, ""Maybe next time.""

 Working Through Pain (Studio 4C)

Written by Brian Azzarello. Continuing on from In Darkness Dwells, Batman is shot in the stomach by a man hallucinating in the sewers of Gotham. He cauterizes the wound and attempts to get out from underground, reflecting on his experiences with managing pain as he does so. First, he remembers volunteering with a relief effort and assisting a doctor in performing surgery without anesthesia. Next, he reflects on the lessons he learned from a woman named Cassandra, who was cast out of her community for disguising herself as a boy in an attempt to join a religious sect. Over several months, she teaches him to minimize his pain to the point where he can control it, sleeping on a bed of needles or standing on hot coals without reacting. One night, several young men appear to harass Cassandra, who takes their blows without seeming to feel them. Bruce steps in to defend her, not only demonstrating his ability to withstand their attacks, but defeating them all with his martial arts skills. Cassandra then tells him to leave, saying that he has learned what he came to learn. She then comments on how Bruce's pain was beyond her, or possibly even his, ability to handle, but how it also appeared to be leading him down a path he desired. Back in the present, Batman ends up in a gutter, where he discovers a cache of guns buried in the garbage. Alfred arrives to assist him and tells Batman to give him his hand so he can pull him out of the gutter, but Batman, arms full of guns, replies that he can't.

 Deadshot (Madhouse)

Written by Alan Burnett. Bruce Wayne has a flashback to the murder of his parents. In his penthouse, he examinines the firearms he took from the underground tunnel's gutter (during the event of Working Through Pain) which he intends to turn in to the police. Wayne admits to Alfred that even though he vowed never to use them in the memory of his parents, he can still understand the temptation to use one. Meanwhile, in another city, an assassin known as Deadshot carries out an assassination on a local mayor and returns to his tropical base. There, one of his associates hires him to carry out a hit in Gotham. It is revealed that The Russian has put out a hit on Lieutenant Gordon, and Batman is called in to protect him. Batman gives Crispus Allen Ronald Marshall's handheld PDA device (which he stole as Bruce Wayne in Field Test), containing a link to encrypted e-mails proving that Ronald Marshall hired Deadshot in the past. He then follows Gordon's motorcade, with Alfred providing satellite-imagery assistance using the new WayneCom satellites. Deadshot attempts to shoot Gordon from a moving train, but Batman deflects the bullet. Deadshot then gleefully reveals that Batman was his real target the entire time, and that the threat against Gordon was merely a ruse to draw him out. He opens fire as the train enters a tunnel, and as Batman attempts to charge Deadshot, he is injured, falling off the train. Deadshot advances to where he saw Batman fall, gloating, but is ambushed from behind and disarmed. He and Ronald Marshall are arrested. Wayne confides to Alfred about how similar the fight in the tunnel seemed to the night his parents were murdered, and comments that ""I've been trying to stop those two bullets all these years."" He expresses discouragement, and Alfred agrees, but adds that he thinks Bruce has a higher purpose. Wayne looks up at the sky and sees the Bat-Signal.

Kevin Conroy, the iconic voice behind the Darkknight Detective in the '90's, returns to give voice to Gotham's protector for this project. Not only are there the six interlocking stories on Disc 1 of the special-edition set, but there are more goodies on Disc 2. A Mirror For The Bat gives us a look at the Batman's greatest villains in a 35-minute presentation which explores how without the villains, the hero would not be as strong, with some of the producers of the project, as well as DC Comics editors and artists and writers. Batman And Me: The Bob Kane Story is a revealing look at the creator of The Dark Knight and the early days of the comic-book incarnation and a biography on Kane, as told by his biographer and by family and friends, a terrific tribute to Kane, who passed away in 1998. Finally, as an extra-special bonus feature, four episodes of the iconic Batman: The Animated Series are presented by producer Bruce Timm-Heart Of Ice, I Am The Night, Legends Of The Dark Knight and Over The Edge. This DVD set is terrific, and the short 73-minute movie is a great bridge between the two Christopher Nolan feature films, which is what it is intended to be. I highly recommend this DVD set for all Bat-fans as well as movie fans, though it is very bloody in parts and skirts an R-rating (the film is rated PG-13). I don't recommend that kids watch the feature (let them watch the less-violent episodes of the Animated Series instead).",1216684800,,12615,4.7652495378927915

But these episodes on this dvd are horrible.  Bad stories, poor animation, lousy point of view and nothing to do with the movies.

It's too bad that the makers of this dvd wasted their time and ours, not to mention our money, as nothing can save this poor turkey from the garbage can it deserves.

3149519,4,B001614F0S,"The Good Things
*Good animation quality and style(s).  Lots of detailed images without overloaded use of computer-generated effects.
*Each short story ventures into a different looks of character design and animation.  It's good for those who are unaccostumed to anime, because they get to see a broad spectrum of styles.
*Dark, wicked style remains consistent with the newest Batman movies (and original comic).
*Good collection of various stories (interlinked, but very very loosely).  Each contains a little bit of good action and drama.
*Pretty good characterization; get to see a little more of Batman's background, and a lot more of the urban myth element.
*A few good bad guys (Deadshot probably being the best; you also get to see Killer Croc, Scarecrow, some guy in a black suit, and the Russian mafia).
*Good dramatic music (but not the same themes as any of the Batman films).

The Bad Things
*Pretty short; seems like there could have been more meaningful stuff put into it.  In particular, the stories don't really tell one coherent story, so it all seems like just another offshoot of the Batman saga (the ""Animatrix"" actually added something to the ""Matrix"" saga, whereas ""Gotham Knight"" doesn't add much to the ""Batman"" series.  It's not requisite watching).

The Questionable Things
*The dark atmosphere and bloody violence makes the show edgy, but is not reccomended for kids (rated PG-13).

Like the ""Animatrix,"" this film provides an array of interesting short stories in different styles and perspectives.  As noted above, however, ""Gotham Knight"" falls a little short.  The storyline(s) offer nothing really spectacular.  But it does provide a little more insight on the character and the mythology of Batman.  Above all, it looks slick and has some good action scenes (and that's all I really cared about anyway).  It's great for anybody who is interested in anime or is a big big fan of Batman, but most casual viewers may be dissapointed.

The disc has good video and sound quality (and is quite splendid on Blu-ray).  Single-disc version doesn't appear to have any special features.  The two-disc and Blu-ray versions have a few featurettes, trailers (including the 2009 release of ""Wonder Woman""), and four episodes from the ""Batman Animated Series.""",1216684800,3,2277,5.130081300813008
3149520,3,B001614F0S,"This is a very hit or miss kind of film. The animation on the blu-ray disc in quality is phenomenal Batman in high-def is worth every penny I paid for this Blu-Ray, but unfortunately, at least for me anyway, the stories themselves were a bit lackluster in terms of length and the fact that Bruce Wayne is not Japanese. The initial concern I had with the Anime animation was exactly what I got with the very culturally confused vision of Bruce Wayne that was put in ""Field Test"" and Kevin Conroy was spot on as Batman as usual but hearing his voice come out of that figure was like hearing Larry the Cable Guy speaking in spanish which I saw in a spanish language version of Blue Collor Comedy Tour Rides Again but anyway I got side tracked.

The length of the stories were nothing we haven't seen but in vein of the occasion I think they could sprung for a few more minutes to each story just to cohesively bond them a little better to the stories before. It felt like I was watching a choppy internet feed of something that was promoted as worth while. I have great respect for everyone that made this happen but lord almighty it could have been so much better.

Don't compare this to anything that you might love about Batman it has those things that make Batman whatever this character is to you but it makes you somehow miss Batman: The Animated Series even more after seeing this. Gotham Knight is like having your favorite NFL team make it to the conference finals only to lose in the final seconds and not make the Superbowl. Not a waste of money in the slightest but defintely not worth the wait and anticipation that was given to it.",1216598400,,1642,4.3980263157894735
3149521,4,B001614F0S,"Far away and practically apart from the sometimes aberrant and misplaced versions with live-action superheroes, Animation remains the most ideal  medium to adapting comic books on screen. Te freedom of expression and designing in animation allows for more energy, details and scope, and the unlimited resources and effects used  to portray any paralel universe imaginable with a self-realism and eloquence taken for granted for the die-hard fans, provide the logic equation and platform in wich classic characters live in perfect harmony with their fantastic environement with endless posibilities for deploying the true potential of their own legends.

The dark caped crusader can't be an exception, specially after the enormous succes of  ""The Dark Knight"" and all the expectations implied in such a tremendous release. These series of short films of different famed Asian Anime directors inspired in the myth of the classic DC character, have an obvious appeal for Animation fans, but the surprising and innovative substance showed in some of these shorts can actually convince a fan of the Batman series, call it comic books or filmic sagas, into fully enjoying the kinetic and beautiful market of stunning action and outstanding design. The arquitecture and texture of the different styles displayed in these amazing stories, trascend over the established stereotypes  of collective comic-book wisdom, making the viewer vulnerable to new contemplations but at the same time hungry for more, calling the experience the nearest concept of true interest and involving not only in the spectacular and explosive show, but also in the dramatic consequences.

An intriguing and mature (PG-13) Art project anthology more than a cohesive whole, not all of the shorts live up to the expectations in a high demanding genre like Animation, but for fans of the adventures of Batman and Anime in general, this collection is a little gem. No one can argue with the level of talents involved, but the underlying flaw of the collection is balance, the hit-or-miss nature of the structure, a factor implied in the obvious diversity of visual styles, art visions of the Dark Knight myth, and illustrated narrative: Some stories are glorious celebrations of  action, other are cerebral detective thrillers. There's really no point of arguing about which stytle is better or worst, because this winning-loosing issue relies in the viewer's preference, and objectively all the different short-films include different perspectives and passions, and an incredible amount of imagination and graphic quality. Some ideas of both corners start with great punch, but eventualy felt truncated, so it's not always a matter choice, but challenge for the viewer and succesful accomplishment of concepts for the writers. Besides, 12 or more minutes are not enough to develop something more than a sketch, and empathy or other in-depth emotions can't be built in such short time, leaving only a mere visual spectacle, regardless of the impressive presentation.

Much like ""The Matrix"" offspring, the short film collection ""The Animatrix"", this series is more than  strictly complementary or a simple offshoot of possibilities about the main theme, but a very colorful catalog of  evocative visuals with not even the smallest sense of continuity or history to bring some coherency to the squizophrenic proceedings, felling more like an technical exercise rather than a complete vision.

That's the biggest flaw of these incredibly talented compilation markets: We can't like all the shorts, because the differences are sometimes diametrical. We become the judge of a talent contest in front of the screen, pick the winners and make them our favorites, but we can't really dispose of the losing contestants, so they become a burden that turns a large percentage of the disc in useless space (and money).

My recommendation: If you can, check more reviews of this product to get a detailded description on each short film and the director's backgrounds, then made your decision about this uneven collection. Here are some:

- Yoshiaki Kawajiri  (Ninja Scroll)
- Soshiro Nimishi (Tekkonkinkreet)
- Yasuhiro Aoki (Steamboy)
- Futoshi Higashide (Mobile suit Gundam)
- Toshiyuki Kubooka (Te secret of Blue Water)
- Hiroshi Morioka (Chronicle of the Wings)",1216598400,6,4318,5.349557522123894

However the visual graphics are quite stunning and as the film progresses the dialogue becomes tighter.  Different versions of artist renditions of Batman works more as a sampler than a full movie. So don't be mis-guided; this is not movie. The only villains portayed in this film are, Killer-Croc, Scarcrow & Dead-Shot. It is the Bonus Material which helps to enhance this collective.

The Two Disc Special Edition has excellent bonus material:

1. Mirror for the Bat--- is an excellent documentary analyzing all the villains opposing Batman throughout his career as crimefighter, and should not be missed.

2. The Bob Kane Story---is a documentary on Batmans creator.

3. Bruce Timm Presents 4 Bonus Batman The Animated Series Episodes

I highly reccomend the Special Edition. Mirror for the Bat is a great documentary

Overall I cannot conceive giving Batman Gotham Knight a 5 star rating. Because it did not contain a consistent theme.

A little bit of action here and there, none truely eye-catching or worth noting. I watched the whole thing waiting for it to get better, and the super short stories were actually so boring it made them feel longer than a petty 12-13 mins each.  some of the same villians (i think) appeared through various episodes, but the chronology was so out of whack you can't follow it, and as mentioned before the characters are drawn so outrageously different through various episodes you can't recognize who is who. in Azzarello's story bruce wayne is drawn so hideously he looks like an animated napoleon dynamite, not the handsome crime fighter you're expecting. my girlfriend even pointed out this point, and then proceeded to insult me for making her sit through such a crappy excuse for a batman story.",1216512000,5,1235,4.717592592592593

Sadly, this film isn't nearly as good as ""...New Frontier"", and only slightly better than ""Superman - Doomsday"".

The idea behind this movie, aside from milking out a few bucks before the release of ""The Dark Knight"" (can't wait to see it tomorrow!), is to do what the people behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Animatrix/dp/B00008LDPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Animatrix</a>&nbsp;did; get some respected Japanese animation studios and have them make some shorts based on the movie(s).

In principle this isn't a bad idea, and for something like The Matrix series, which so clearly draws inspiration from anime, it might work very well. It works less well, however, for a universe like the one shown in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000BUYP4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, which is much more grounded in as much reality as any super-hero film can be.

The animation in the movie is decent, but nothing to write home about (of course I'm not some big-time otaku, so take that for what it's worth). The storylines are ok. One where Batman gets a device that keeps him safe from bullets works out ok, as does the one with Killer Croc, but overall none of the stories are that great.

There are some good things, though. It's always great to hear Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman/Bruce Wayne. He really nails it and does a great job with both characters. All the rest of the voice-acting is quite good, too.

But where this set really shines is in the extras. There's a great biography of Bob Kane (and people like me will get a real big laugh out of the ""News On Parade"" feature at the begining). My favorite extra, however, is the four episodes of the animated Batman series, which includes two of my favorite episodes from the show.

Ultimately I give really only one, maybe two, stars for the movie itself, but with those extras the set gets a boost up to three stars! Still not great, but at least I don't feel ripped-off by it.",1216339200,27,2744,6.224274406332454

I don't like the way it was 6 separate stories animated by different people and put together as a single presentation.  There wasn't much continutiy at all.  I only saw where one story related to the other, though they were supposed to all be congruent.
The first of the 6 stories was by far my least favorite.  I really disliked the animation style, and the storyline was weakly executed.
Honestly, the whole set seemed disorganized and disjointed, and while I was mildly entertained, I certainly wasn't thrilled or going ""wow.""
That said, some of the animation is done extremely well and very life-like. I was impressed by that.

I don't think the disc is a rip off or trying to take fanboys money as some say. No one is being forced to buy these discs and you can always just rent them. I'm glad to have bought the Blu-ray and encourage the studio to bring us more innovative releases such as this one.

I also wanted to say that some of the animation was great while others were kind of experimental. Different techniques and styles are used to tell the 6 stories and I welcomed them all. I liked the Batman Animated animation but it doesn't hold up to the animation you will see on this disc. Kawajiri's art in one of the story's was amazing.

The writing is bad. Really bad and really obvious.  Amazing Goyer let his name remain on this (he has one segment), but he's had his klunkers before.  The stories ALL lack for inspiration or invention.  The whole time, you're yearning for some snap, some smarts.  It never comes.  Most of the animation is even worse.  The last piece felt a little more evenly constructed and satisfying, only because the segments preceding that one were so jaw-droppingly bad.

The animation character design in a couple of pieces is so utterly lacking in any kind of grace or artistry, it's all the more evident that this thing was farmed out with no central artistic oversight, no vision, in an attempt to squeeze more money out of the BATMAN franchise....as if it were just an after-thought from the marketing department, handed off to Chris Nolan's assistant (who sadly will be stuck with the creative blame for this dreck for years to come) to keep it ""in the family"".

It's really a shame, as Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT promises to be terrific, deep, a hallmark of modern blockbusters.  To even associate ""Gotham Knight"" with THAT movie is just a crime.

Don't waste your money.  This has nothing of the inventiveness or intrigue or artistic integrity of ""The Animatrix.""  This is sheer junk spewed out to suck your money quick.  14-year old fanboys will eat it up.  But if you've got any kind of standard for entertainment, this isn't even worth a rental.

3149535,3,B001614F0S,"Similar to the treatment it gave the Matrix sequels (remember Animatrix?), Warner Bros. has released a new dvd of Batman-inspired, anime-styled shorts in anticipation of ""The Dark Knight"" with mixed results. Here's a quick rundown:

""Have I Got a Story For You""- a group of teenage kids share their stories of having ""met"" Batman. Basically, this is an excuse to see a few varying incarnations of the ol' caped crusader as a Most Batman fans have seen this kind of thing before. Not much to this short, actually. Rating: * out of ****

""Crossfire""- Two Gotham detectives find themselves in the middle of a gang shoot-out. Batman shows up and kicks a lot of butt. I particularly admired the animation in this violent short. This was also the short where I learned that Batman is apparently fireproof (??). Rating *** out of ****

""Field Test""- We get a glimpse of Lucius Fox in this short. Batman tries out a new gadget while busting up a bunch of gangsters at the Gotham City docks. After one of the criminals is mortally wounded, Batman races to save his life. Rating ** out of ****

""In Darkness Dwells""- Batman goes head-to-head with anime-version of Killer Croc then is infected with a dose of Scarecrow's scare toxin. The look of this short is very different to the two that preceded it, and it certainly focused on style over substance. I gave this one an extra star considering we're treated to a double-dose of villainy with both Croc and Scarecrow. Rating *** out of ****

""Working Through Pain""- An injured Batman flashbacks on being trained on how to deal with pain. The slower pace of this short makes it seem twice as long as most of the others, but some fans may appreciate the insight into Bruce Wayne/Batman's character. Rating ** out of ****

""Deadshot""- Batman must defeat an assassin with incredible aim. Personally, I thought this was the strongest entry on the dvd. Great animation, interesting premise, a good villain, and plenty of Batman kicking villainous booty. Rating **** out of ****

Don't look for continuity here; there's really none between the shorts. Each is a 12 minute mini-movie of its own right.

The voice work was fine, and fans of Batman: The Animated Series will certainly be happy with the inclusion of Kevin Conroy. Other than the first short, I thought the animation was quite good, but if you're not a fan of anime, this will not change your mind. I liked the design and style of some shorts more than others. The shorts are... well, too SHORT to really engage you in plot or characterization.

The double disc version is worth getting for the extra episodes of Batman: The Animated Series alone. Sadly, there is no commentary or introductions for these episodes.

Overall, Gotham Knight is a mixed bag. It certainly won't blow you away, but for serious Batman fans, it will serve as something new and different to add to your collection.",1216252800,5,2884,4.738522954091817

The fact that there were 6 stories animated by 6 different people, and none of them really linking to each other made it hard to finish. Each one of the stories are good on its own, but its weird to see a young long haired Bruce Wayne then see and older wiser man on the next story.

On its own, it is a pretty cool super hero animated show, but when i watch Dark Knight, I won't be able to bridge Begins, Gotham knight, and Dark Knight like i did for Star Wars II, Clone Wars, and III.

  A pointless rewrite of a great Batman Animated Series episode called (""Legends Of the Dark Knight"") This works half as well but is somewhat compensated with impressive background animation that gives the city a real sense of place.
  ""Crossfire""
  Not a very crafty story that focuses on why we need Batman.  Been done before in many alterations on Batman Animated Series and is very unconvincing.
  ""Field Test""
  Another throw away with a pointless excursion into an idea that goes nowhere. Don't make Lucius Fox into a James Bond 'Q'
  ""In Darkness Dwells""
  One of the best episodes examining Batman's battle with Killer Croc.  Excellent dramatic tension and a fine action story as we see the interaction between Batman and Gordon.  Why couldn't this have been the starting story!
  ""Working Through Pain""
  A nice episode examining Bruce's past with a great ending that leaves you thinking rather than just wrapping up the episode.
  ""DeadShot""

3149538,5,B001614F0S,"Combining some of the greatest writers in the business, Gotham Knight is a 6 story movie that focuses on how Bruce Wayne went from The Batman to The Dark Knight.

Have I Got A Story For You: Starts off the movie with a group of kids telling stories of their encounters of the Batman. They are ranging from him being a shadow creature that can disappear and re-appear at will, to simply a giant bat. This isn't the best start to the movie but it gives us an idea of how Batman is perceived by those in the Gotham world.

Crossfire: Is a story based around two cops, Detectives Ramirez & Allen. Allen & Ramirez are dropping a criminal off at an insane asylum and on the journey we're subjected to the hatred that the man has for the Dark Knight. He doesn't like vigilantes but after being caught in a crossfire between the Russians & the Italians, Allen's mind is changed when the Batman shows up.

Field Test: Is a vision of a young Batman trying out the new gadgets created by Lucius Fox, but after an accident caused as a result of one of the gadgets, Wayne decides towards other means of protection.

In Darkness Dwells: Written by David Goyer, writer of Blade and co-writer of Batman Begins. The Dark Knight finds himself in the sewers of Gotham City where he's forced to take on Killer Croc and once again fight the Scarecrow.

Working Through Pain: This shows us the interesting past of Bruce and how he was taught the skill of handling pain.

Deadshot: The title speaks for itself as in this finale we're shown the real reason why Batman hates guns as he's forced to take on the might of the man that never misses.

I went into this film with a bit of skepticism as I'm not usually a fan of the anime style of animation. However, the short stories featured in this feature length animation are astounding and shed some light on the Batman character. The whole anime style is not for everyone, and I must say before I saw this I hated the style myself. After seeing this I come to realise that this style of animation has a way of showing real emotion through clever imagery. Be warned though, to those parents of children who are fans of the Batman series and are thinking of buying this for their kids, it has its moments of graphic violence and colourful use of language.

3149546,4,B001614F0S,"Taking a concept from the AniMatrix, the Magic behind DC brings you a wonderful collection of stories about the Gotham Knight in preparation for the next film. DC continues their adventure into PG13 films with our beloved heroes at the helm, and it is a wonderful ride. Like Superman: Doomsday, Gotham Knight is darker (as dark as our Dark Knight can get in a PG13 film). The images are creative, but it is the stories that blow me away.

The series opens up with a group of skaters recalling their own versions of Batman tackling the same villian throughout Gotham. This ploy has been used in the Batman animated series, but it still works on DVD. And from there the acts take a life of their own. Each act is different from the next, telling a different story, but with a surprisingly delicate theme built throughout that only emerges in the wonderfully powerful fifth act (Work through the pain).

If you pick up on the subtle message about Batman's quest and guns, then the directors have succeeded in their vision of exploring what makes Batman tick.

I rate Gotham Knight four stars, because by seperating the stories into different acts, I think it cheapens the messsage the writers and directors had in mind. Gotham Knight can easily be made into feature animated movies about Batman night out in Gotham. The episodic nature of the movies throughs me off.

As added bonus, for those patiently waiting for the live action WonderWoman film, there is a sneak peek into the animated movie. It looks to be just as edgy and aggressive as the Batman and Superman films.",1215907200,,1570,4.698181818181818
3149547,3,B001614F0S,"'Batman: Gotham Knight' is a series of six animated shorts, each featuring its own creative vision of the Dark Knight. This format has its strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand it's interesting to see a variety of interpretations of Batman, but on the other, none of the stories are long enough to be satisfyingly developed. There is a loose story thread that runs through the entire piece, but it is weakly executed and doesn't really make the movie cohere. Conversely, the use of the same voice actors throughout doesn't allow each short to feel distinct (while I LOVE Kevin Conroy as Batman, he doesn't sound appropriate for most of the ""Gotham Knight"" character designs). Finally, the different looks for Batman aren't all that different. They're all dark, moody and kinetic, and they all fit into about three schools of anime aesthetics.

But it's not all bad. The production value is high and it's clear the creators were passionate about crafting this movie. The backgrounds are lush, the character designs are intricate and the animation is well executed. And the stories are decent concepts, they just don't have enough time to breathe. I'd recommend ""Gotham Knight"" for Batman or anime fans, but anybody more casually interested should definitely rent this before they buy it.",1215907200,4,1290,5.02803738317757
3149548,5,B001614F0S,"Batman, Gotham Knight was supposed to fill in the spots left between Batman begins and the Dark Knight movie released on July 18. It is a multi-part tale of stories deplicting Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, the Batman, as he deals with his struggle to get some kind of balance in his new life. The first tale, 'Have I Got a Story for you', is 4 teens and their experience of watching Batman take down a criminal in their own words and imaginations. It is only at the last point in the story, where the 4th kid watches the real Batman, wounded and hanging on to stop the assailant in a fog of smoke, come out of nowhere to get an assist. This tale seems to be separate from the other 5 as the stories all begin to interrelate, using two detectives off Lt Gordon's detail, help Batman return a crook back to the island prison last seen in 'Begins' in a tale called Crossfire. ""Field Test' is a tale as Bruce Wayne tests out a new device created by Lucius Fox that can deflect bullets while getting information on murders being commited by a sharpshooter. In Darkness Dwells is possibly the most atmosperic episode as it shows Batman going into the sewers to find a priest kidnapped by the Scarecrow and his accomplice, Killer Croc. Both look terrifying and children should be warned that Gotham Knights goes beyond PG-13. Surviving the fight but getting wounded leads Bruce to remember his training on manging pain and giving us a quiet tale called 'Working Through Pain' where he met a female sensai. This episode has one of the most definitive scenes in Batman history when it concludes. The final story, is Batman risking his life to stop Deadshot, the assasin, from another victim. In all of the stories, japanese animation is used to deplict details and facial reactions that are truly fresh in spinning a Batman tale and hopefully this will lead to another series where many people had a bad taste in The Batman series that was on kids WB not too long ago.",1215907200,,1960,4.53954802259887

For anyone who came into this DVD expecting it to be similar to the Animatrix...it's not.

For anyone expecting this to be worth watching...your call, but I don't think so.

After watching it, it was HEAVILY influenced by Japanese animation techniques, and looks somewhat like a median between Avatar and Princess Mononoke. The mouths were never matched to what was said, and it was very dark.

This style of animation had considerable amounts of blood (for animation), and I would not recommend this for children, even though I absolutely love Batman:TAS.

Lastly, this DVD moved very slowly, with very little plot stretched out over a ridiculous length of time. It had some interesting shots, but overall, don't waste your time or money.",1215907200,11,844,5.0

While each one can be viewed independently, they do all work tie back together. Except for the first episode, all of the episodes are tiny masterpieces. They explain why despite the fact that Batman can completely protect himself from gunfire, he doesn't. They show his pain endurance training. They even show what happened to characters from Batman Begins such as Scarecrow. The special features are also quite entertaining, particularly the documentary about Batman's villains that consists of several notable comic book and screenwriters.

3149551,4,B001614F0S,"This movie has gotten reviews of 'amazing', 'horrible', and everything in between.  It is not a third Batman movie and will not wow everyone into forgetting that The Dark Knight comes out 2 weeks later.  It is, however, an enjoyable look at a string of related (yes, they are related) events in between Batman Begins and Dark Knight.  Are there plots holes, inconsistancies, and completely incorrect statements?  Absolutely.  Is it enjoyable visually and creatively? You bet.  The animation is stunning and most of the stories are very enjoyable.  Some of the depictions of Batman/Bruce are questionable, but there are enough consistancies (the Narrows, Scarecrow, Lt. Gordon) to confirm you are watching a Gotham that pretty closely resembles the one from the movie(s).  All in all, this is very impressive visually and creative in its presentation.  If you own Batman Begins and plan on seeing Dark Knight opening weekend, buy this.  If you own more than one copy of Batman Begins and more than 5 Batman DVDs of one kind or another and will be waiting in line on Thursday for Dark Knight, you will be so disgusted with the plot holes and inconsistancies, you probably won't be able to get past them to enjoy it.  I am of the former, so I recommend this one highly.",1215820800,3,1266,4.814814814814815
3149552,1,B001614F0S,"I wanted to like this but could not.  I think the concept was an interesting experiment but it failed.  The anime style simply does not work for Batman.  The animation for a few of the stories came close to looking right for Batman but most did not, and some of it was ugly.  The stories were too short to develop properly so as a result they are mostly shallow and uninteresting.  Apparently, the idea was that they were to tie together to tell a larger story but I did not see that happen.

The best thing about this effort was the return of Kevin Conroy to the part that he made his own.  I would have given two stars just for his work, but decided to give it one to balance all those who gave it five stars before they even saw it.",1215820800,11,735,4.0979020979020975
3149553,3,B001614F0S,"I was very close to purchasing this dvd on the day it was released. I am very glad that I didn't spend the money to own this movie. I was expecting some kind of bridge between the new Batman films - Begins and Dark Knight - which is definitely not what this is at all. I am not a die hard fan of DC Comics, but I enjoy the batman films...of course with exception to the disastrous Batman and Robin. What were they thinking ?!? All the cheesy one liners are rediculous...especially Arnold...yikes.

  Anyway, back to the point. This movie is aimed more for the comic fan, in my opinion. Some of the stories are based off of older comic book ideas, like who the Batman really is etc.. This may be worth a rental just to check it out if your local place has it in stock, but I would rent it first before purchasing. If you aren't expecting what the movie has to offer, you can easily tune this out and turn it off before the 3rd short film. The only neat part of this set is the different approaches to the animation style, if you are in to that sort of thing. The artistic part of the films is very interesting to see, but the stories themselves are a little odd and hard to really get excited about.

  If you are a fan of Batman, or just have some spare time, it is worth seeing once. If you go into the dvd knowing that it doesn't have anything to do with the other movies, you should be alright. Because of the release date being so close to the opening of the Dark Knight, I was expecting something completely different. This mind set probably made this movie less enjoyable for me personally. All in all, like I mentioned, it is probably worth seeing once, but save your money until you know you want to own it.

3149554,5,B001614F0S,"Prior to watching this animation, I read a lot bad reviews from other forums that this movie is at best C+. I started watching without much expectation and I was prepared to be disappointed. I was blown by away how adult and fantastic this animated collection was. Each episode offered a unique stylized look for batman and I enjoyed each one for its unique flavor. Five Stars.",1215820800,2,377,4.641791044776119
3149555,5,B001614F0S,"Everywhere I've been reading about this movie I find some of the strangest comments and criticisms.  I see people totally missing the point and comparing it to things that have no business in the same conversation.  I've seen people giving some of the best chapters low grades, or even skipping over stories all together complaining that it doesn't have the Joker or Harvey Dent in it.

Doesn't everybody know what this is?  Don't you like Batman?  When you viewed this weren't you expecting dark and violent themes, crazy animation and art styles, a pool of varied talent and types of stories, some nice nods to the Nolan universe and the much larger world of the comics that rarely get rendered off the page, plus the high quality of work Bruce Timm and company always deliver?  Because you see that's exactly what I got.

What we have here is the first time we've seen some of the mature themes and situations inherent in the Batman world in animated form with a lot of the talent that made the animated series, that everybody loves and holds as a benchmark for Superhero animation, including Kevin Conroy the best voice of Batman we're likely to ever see.  In fact this may be his final performance as the character and it was nice to have him rendered in such different manners.

The stories are about as long as an Adult Swim or Three Stooges episode and the short form gives the feel of reading 6 single comics taking an issue to explore a theme or tell an interesting tale, all in the same continuity but by different creative teams.  ""Why doesn't it lead into the new movie"" and all those types of arguments are unfounded, it never claimed to do that it just takes place in the continuity of the new films meaning a more grounded universe.  Batman uses his glider cape, they comment on the aftermath of what happened in the Narrows, Lucius is specifically Bruce's tech go-to guy, Maroni and the mob (although I'm sure characterized completely different) make an appearance, the elevated trains and less industrial look of Gotham City and so on.  There are subtle nods and little bits of info but nothing more then some really cool Batman stories in a still expanding universe.

Did you really want to see some clumsy animated movie that pastes up the gaps between two well conceived films for the sake of marketing to the lowest common denominator of pop culture fan?

We get a great Bruce Wayne training story that expands on the idea not made clear enough in the first movie that he did more then just work with Ducard/Ra's, we also get young naive Bruce learning that cutting edge technology isn't enough to wage his war, we pick up on the fact that the Scarecrow/Crane has sunken more into darkness since what happened and we are introduced to the first ""creature"" of the Nolan universe, Killer Croc - also seen through fear toxin.  Also Gotham PD and young Gordon (although at times feeling too young) was well done and in the mode of what we are sure to see in the next movie.  Of course it also had some of those Batman moments that stand out among his best and send a childlike chill through you when someone just gets it right.

I only thing I will agree with is that I thought it was odd retelling the classic story of kids talking about the time they saw Batman but it was done so unique and different and it set up the varying styles of the film that it was in fact a pretty damn good idea and probably the reason they stomped out their internal doubts about starting off that way, and the concepts and animation in that one were cool and bizarre.

I don't know what else to say other then don't look it over, these movies have to sell good and not be picked apart but fanboys who don't know what they want in order for WB to continue to make these mature animated takes on the DC Universe.  It's full of great animation and art and although a few of the performances fall short at times I was more then happy with the voice acting which is always of a high caliber when Andrea Romano is involved.  Plus the special features are probably the best yet on these new PG-13 DVD films.

...and face it people, if The Dark Knight wasn't coming out in a week you would all be going insane over this thing.  Don't get picky, remember that there have been many times Batman wasn't doing so well.",1215820800,5,4307,4.47381864623244
3149556,2,B001614F0S,"I was very excited when this DVD was announced to be released, I was at the store on release date ready to get it.  But after I watched it there as a twinge of dissappointment.  Perhaps, that was because I assumed it would be more like the Animatrix, a series of disconected vignettes that enriched the ideas of the Matrix universe.
Gotham Knight did not do that. The animation styles were all too familiar, drab dialogue and the stories rehashed well defined aspects of Batman lore.  Even when the action got going the personifications of Batman did not have any heart or depth and I felt no connection with this usually engaging character. Worst of all, there seemed to be no connection with the upcoming movie, Dark Knight; the connections may become identifiable after I see the film, but this precursor did not further pique my interest.

My favourite episode, though, was ""Through the Pain,"" and was pretty cool in its own right.

I will most likely not purchase anymore of Warner Bros. upcoming animation sets, like the upcoming Wonder Woman dvd.",1215820800,6,1053,4.763736263736264

Even if you take all the stories and put them together there wasn't a solid story to tell. Really the story was sort of an excersise in beefing up the background and less glamorous parts of the Batman universe. If you were to take all the stories as a whole the ending feels like a bit of a cliffhanger. 2) The special features don't interest me enough to make the extra cost worth my while. Yeah, if you are a big fan then of course it won't matter but for those who may be on the fence just think about getting the standard set ... you won't watch the rest more than once anywho.",1215734400,,690,4.156716417910448

However, the remaining chapters make up for the lackluster beginning chapter.  The EXTRAS ARE AWESOME and in my opinion make this DVD worth buying alone. The life story of the late Bob Kane and his invention of Batman would make a great movie in and of itself I think.  The analysis of Batman and his villians is EXCELLENT. In Batman's character disection it gets to the heart of why the character of Batman strikes such a chord with fans everywhere.

3149560,3,B001614F0S,"Gotham Knight is a collection of animated shorts by David Goyer, Josh Olson, and Alan Burnett. The events of ""Knight"" are meant to take place between the""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" movies. The six animated shorts run together to tell a story but I had a hard time figuring out what the true meaning of the story was. At the end of ""Knights"" I was left scratching my head. Nothing new or incredibly revealing happens and for as much as I wanted to like ""knights"" I was really disappointed. Some of the stories hit it out of the park animation wise but failed story wise and only a few succeeded in both fields. Overall a good collection for batman fans but it's far from the ""Masterpiece"" that it claims to be on its back cover. Here's how I saw it.

""Have I got a story for you"" 4/5 -A creative look at a child's imagination and how it distorts reality when they encounter Batman.

""Crossfire"" 2/5 Two cops get caught in a crossfire between two warlords. Batman saves them. the end.

""Field Test"" 3/5 Fox invents new technology for Batman that could save his life but bats realizes that it's too dangerous.

""In Darkness Dwells"" 5/5 excellent animation and my pick for best short. Batman goes into the sewers of Gotham for a showdown between Scarecrow and killercroc to recuse a priest.

""Working through pain""4/5 Batman has a flash back to a time when he studied under a yogi master in oder to master pain. Interesting story and moral.

""Deadshot""2/5 Batman has a showdown with the old villain Deadshot. good action.

Disk two has a nice feature with an array of people who have worked on Batman though out the years. They offer excellent insight to the character and his relationship with his villains. One of the best Batman features I've seen. Disk two also has four selected episodes from the animated series all of them excellent choices. I'm still a little conflicted about ""Knight"" I think I was expecting too much but none the less it's definitely worth a view.",1215734400,5,1980,4.607954545454546
3149561,3,B001614F0S,"This movie, comprising 6 short stories, fails to really find a central theme that unites all six films, and the individual short stories aren't engaging enough to stand up on their own. With that said, there are a couple of gems amongst the six. Unfortunately, none of them are better than anything ""Batman: The Animated Series"" delivered.

The visuals and sound are excellent. Adam Conroy once again returns as the voice of Batman, and there is no better voice for Gotham's Dark Knight.

I'd reccommend this film only to serious Batman fans, or serious anime fans. If you're only into Batman because of Batman Begins, don't bother with this film.",1215734400,5,647,4.872727272727273

Once you get past that,the story is really awesome!! The animation is superb,particularly in the latter chapters and it was so nice to hear Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman once again-as many others have already said,CW's""The Batman""was a disappointment from that standpoint. If you purchase the two disc set,you're in for a treat as far as extras go-there is a super documentary on Bob Kane,the man who created the Caped Crusader and a wonderful piece on the villians of Gotham City. Also,the packaging is most unique-inside the protective cardboard sleeve is an awesome 3-D holographic image of Batman taking on Deadshot!

3149563,4,B001614F0S,"...and more troublesome reviews. Now everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I would never say otherwise, but some of these reviews are unfair, biased and make no sense. First off, the animation is not terrible, in any of these short films. Anyone who says otherwise is ignorant of animation. They may not enjoy the STYLE of the drawings, but the animation, movement, camera angles, colors and backgrounds ranged from good to excellent in each film. Some of the figure drawing is poor, but it is definitely a minority rather than a majority of the figures that look off. There have been episodes of Batman the animated series (A show that i will always love) that were animated 1000 times worse than the worst animated film on this dvd (The Mechanic, Prophecy of Doom and The Strange Secret of Bruce Wyane come to mind)so there shouldn't really be a complaint in that department. Some people just hate Japanese animation and its style, to each their own, but don't review on a pre-existing bias. Kevin Conroy voices Batman in all of the shorts, and does a great job as usual. The stories range from ok to great, it is my first viewing, but as of now i would say Working through the pain, Deadshot and In Darkness Dwells really stand out. Have I got a story for you is very similar to the episode Legends of the Dark Knight from batman season 4, but the stories told in this short are all linked, and I think it is a clever short, and the riskiest of all the shorts. It presents batman in a more cartoony style, and I think it works very well, an unexpected and pleasant surprise. Working through the pain was excellent in showing more of Bruce Wayne's training, in medicine and pain endurance, it is very true to the spirit of the film maker's goals in Batman Begins, explaining how he came to be the brilliant crime fighter he is. The animation, in my humble opinion, is also superb. Crossfire's animation left a little to be desired from me, except for the end of the short, the story was a bit disjointed and boring, but the atmosphere was amazing, Arkham its doctors and inmates very creepy, and batman himself the epitome of cool. Even a weak short shows promise here. Field test had good animation, the faces were a little bland for me, but the interaction between Wayne and Lucious Fox was entertaining and enjoyable, the plot was interesting and at the end stayed extremely true to Batman's heart, he will risk his own skin, not anyone else's (not even a crook). In Darkness Dwells scores top marks from me in style and animation, it almost looks like Mike Mignola drew it, the designs of Croc and Scarecrow are great, and Gotham City is portrayed as gothic and creepy as it should. No complaints there. Deadshot was well animated, and a pretty good story, but it took the least risks i think, which is fine. Batman tries to foil an assassin, and tries to deal with his gun problem. People say the film doesn't link the two movies (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight)...but at this point in time Gotham Knight is not out in theaters, so how does anyone know it doesn't? The escape of Arkham prisoners is alluded to and its effects depicted in Crossfire, the fate of the escaped scarecrow explained in In Darkness Dwells, the Narrows mentioned, Gordon is continuing his quest of cleaning up the police force, the change he began in Batman Begins continues...plenty of links. The shorts aren't long enough to include EVERYTHING, there has to be something left for The Dark Knight, right? Why should the Joker be in this if he's going to have an entire movie devoted to him? And who really wants more Rachel Dawes? Not me (sorry thats bias...woops). As for the ""consistency"" issue, this is a collection of short films, if they were all the same the format would be pointless, and it would be boring. These are different visual interpretations. Batman isn't much of a detective in these shorts, I will concede, but he wasn't really much of one in Batman Begins either, was he? They still have to flesh that aspect out in the new franchise I feel. The bottom line, good animation, sometimes great, some very original stories, some interesting twists on stories we've seen, and some that just tread water, but tread it well. It's anime, if you like anime or have an open mind, try it. If you hate anime, or you are a slave to the continuity of the comics or Batman Begins, don't pick this up. Also, its annoying when people buy something they haven't rented or read reviews of and then rant about how they made a bad decision. Don't write a review of being an impulsive consumer, review the product. 3.5/4 stars give or take.

Rent it first.  The first story is horrible.  The animation is off; Batman looks different in every story as does Bruce Wayne.  Each story is only 12 minutes long so there's not enough to satisfy you.  They'd be better off having fewer stories and making them longer.

3149565,3,B001614F0S,"This new Batman DVD has impressive looking animation, but I found the story somewhat frustrating to follow at times.  The best of its six segments were those involving the villains Scarecrow and Deadshot (esp. the Deadshot tale), but others tended to be very artsy (such as the story about Bruce Wayne learning from a female sensei type).  The opening sketch is clever in its use of the skateboard kids and their perspectives of Batman's encounter with an enemy, but it's also ineffective as a story since it tells little about who the criminal is, what he did, etc.  In fact, all throughout the disc, I had a ""huh?"" reaction way too often, not understanding exactly what was happening or why.",1215648000,14,693,4.758333333333334
3149566,5,B001614F0S,"Ok, alot of people seem to have a problem with the animation, I, for one think it's amazing. If you like Anime-styled art, then you'll love this! The only segment that wasn't great in this movie was the first one; ""Have I Got A Story For You"" I don't think it's just horrible, It's kinda cool what people could think about Batman, but it doesn't really fit in with the rest of it, I think this could have been added as a bonus feature episode, and they could have focused more on the story than to add this into it. My favorite episode is ""Field Test"" It has a total anime feel to it, and Bruce Wayne resembles Light Yagmai (Death Note character) quite a bit, IMO. But you get more character out of Bruce in this one. I also enjoyed ""Dead Shot"" alot, the animation is very detailed in it. Although I'm not too crazy how they made Bruce look in it, it's still one of the best episodes.

I really enjoyed most of the episodes, the only problem with it is the storyline doesn't tie in all together just great, but if they had more time than 15 minutes a episode to make it, I think this could have been just amazing. But I still give this 5 stars as I've watched it 3 times and I have really enjoyed it alot. You get a Dark, More Violent, and Epic Batman in this mini-series movie.

3149567,4,B001614F0S,"I'm not going to say this is the best animated batman ever, because honestly, it isn't. This DVD doesn't break new ground for Batman. It's not the end all be all of Batman. It isn't something I would hold up as being definitive Batman by any means.

What I will say is that this is a quality product that any Batman fan should enjoy. If you like your Batman grim, dark and violent, this should keep you very happy. These micro-stories are done very much in the style of the comic books.

That means each writer/animator is going to have their own flavor, their own touch that they bring to each segment. It is very much like Animatrix in that respect. One episode may not be your cup of tea. Another episode you may absolutely love. My own personal opinion, I didn't really care for ""Have I Got a Story For You."" ""Working Through Pain,"" gave me a luke warm reaction. ""Darkness Dwells"" and ""Deadshot"" were absolutely great. Just my own opinions.

Some have complained about the animation. These reviews I believe come from people who have had limited to no exposure to anime. Each of the episodes has a different style of animation, but are each very common styles of Japanese animation. Anyone who has had any in depth exposure to Japanese animation and has come to enjoy it should not have too many qualms with the animation.

I also like the fact that Kevin Conroy is back doing the voice acting of Bruce Wayne and Batman. At first I was afraid he'd only be in one of the segments and the sweetness would be short-lived. But he does, in fact, play Batman in all six episodes. For those who don't know who Kevin Conroy is (shame on you in the first place), he is the one who did the voice acting for Batman in the extremely popular Batman: The Animated Series. For anyone who watched that series, ""Kevin Conroy"" is nearly as synonymous with ""Batman"" as ""Adam West."" Hearing him doing the voice acting is very welcome. The fact that there are 4 bonus episodes from the Animated Series (Two DVD edition or Blu-Ray edition) is just icing on the cake.

There are one or two things I have to bring up as negatives, however. Parents should be wary of getting this for their kids. It is violent. There is blood. It should be screened before letting your children watch.

This also is not quite the connection between the first and second movies as was promised. Except for the fact that the Arkam breakout from Batman Begins is referenced a few times, you would hardly even know that this takes place in the same continuity as the films. It could easily just be set in it's own side-universe. Which for me is fine. I have no qualms with it being unrelated to the movies, but that wasn't really what was advertised.

This still boils down to a very entertaining collection of shorts that any Batman Fan should enjoy if they can just keep an open mind to the Japanese styled animation.",1215648000,4,2877,4.489483747609943

3149569,4,B001614F0S,"I have to say that I am a fairly big Batman fan. I received this dvd today and I immediately watched it. And I liked it. It is certainly not as good as the Animatrix but its not bad either. It has no very visible connection with Batman Begins other than the design of the Batmobile in the short ""Field Test"".

The shorts are not too impressive but it is a lot of fun to see the different interpretations of Batman. I have to say that the two best shorts were ""In Darkness Dwells"" because of its simple (but still interesting) story written by David S. Goyer who helped Nolan write Batman Begins but more for its incredible style which fit Batman and his world perfectly with out looking to overly 'anime'

The second best short was ""Working Through Pain"" because of the story alone. The animation style was OK. But the story by 100 Bullets writer  Brian Azzarello was amazingly original and simple and felt like it could have been cut directly into ""Batman begins"".

Overall it was enjoyable Thats why I give it four stars. All of the stories except for the two noted above were OK. I wanted more original stories that could have given me insight to characters inside the movie like Rachel Dawes or the scarecrow (he has a very small cameo in the short 'In Darkness Dwells') or maybe a short about Jim Gordon fighting or firing corrupt police or something fresh.

If you liked this collection of shorts then you should definitely check out the Batman: Black and White series. it feels the same in every way. tons of well known and unknown artists and writers get to write shorts about batman in their own style. The first volume is great the second one is good.

If you are a Batman fan then you should certainly buy this to add to your collection",1215648000,2,1747,4.44375
3149570,3,B001614F0S,"I am an animation student and this is not poor animation, its the style that does not fit. All six of the pieces have beautiful animation and are well put together , it just does not feel like Batman. Batman to me is Gothic 1950's and this does not capture that imo.
  My favorite of all the episodes was the final one with Dead shot. I be leave it had the same animation crew that did the newer Vampire Hunter D movie , I wish the Warner Brothers Premier crew would have gave them all the money to make the whole film , that episode came closest to getting it right.
  The two disk version did have some nice features , it had a nice piece on Bob Kane the creator of Batman and also a fun featurette on Batman villains. My favorite feature has to be the 4 episodes of Bruce Timm's Batman the animated series all of them classics from that series , my personal favorite ""Over the Edge"" is awesome.
  So overall this is not a bad product just weak when compared to the last Warner Brothers premier release. I would like to get Bruce Timm alone, and off the record about this project , He as an animator is a minimalist and brilliant and  I would love to hear how he felt this turned out, I am willing to bet he is not happy.",1215561600,4,1223,4.11344537815126
3149571,4,B001614F0S,"I thought this was a good buy.  I liked some of the segments better than the others, but I found this overall very enjoyable.  Much like the Animatrix, you will see different styles, but I think any Batman fan will find at least 1 or 2 segments they like.  I picked up the steelbook version and I recommend it.  It was available at Best Buy but has since sold out at most locations.",1215561600,2,382,4.191780821917808
3149572,5,B001614F0S,"Oh my god I can't believe how amazing this is! Broken into six parts/stories each one with fantastic animation and incredible artwork. The first part has incredible detailed background. Usually they don't go to that much trouble. The only part I felt was lacking was story number four. In art not Story!

My two favorite parts was the first one because it was similar to an episode of batman the animated series: you know the one with the kids and their stories and there perceptions of batman. It takes you back but unlike that batman from what seemed like so long ago, the violence has been amped up! And the last one with Deathshot I never liked him because I always thought of him as the ""poor man's Bullseye!""

Another incredible thing is they got the voice of Kevin Conroy which is the Batman from the animated series. In my mind and heart the only real Batman.

Man this really deserves ten stars not five. See the animated version of Batman has always been better then the live action stuff. Because one: a real grown man dressed in a batsuit is ridiculus and animated grown man somehow looks natural and two: You can do stuff that you can't do in live action. As the six and final part proves! Actually there are a few things that can only be done by animation throughout the whole movie but then again six is my favorite.

Now if they could only do this with Superman. Adam Baldwin as Superman, I kept expecting Superman to rob a bank and side with the bad guy. Shouldn't typecast but he was really good as Jane. Just as Kevin is really good as Batman!!",1215561600,3,1563,4.435540069686411

This film sucks. Mostly I disliked it because of the terrible animation.

Perhaps I'm a bit biased, I'm one of those Batman fans that never got past how badly Batman Begins sucks. I'm a classic fan, Adam West and Michael Keaton all the way.

If you want to see a dark Batman, pay attention to the character that MK played in Batman and Batman Returns. That's good Batman.

Just reading the first chapters made me excited to see the dvd, however i just watched it and i was vastly dissapointed! The stories are in six parts but they are shorter than short can be! I think the opening credits are longer than the entire dvd. Well the book has a point of a big crime that is happening that started with a murder of a woman. Well the 3 stories ignore the point and just bs some lame side tales that are as long as a commercial. Besides the 2 stories with scarecrow, killer crock (don't blink) and deadshot-witch are good-the dvd is a short let down. I advise reading the book first so you can know whats going on then watch the dvd for fun and the speacial features are short but good enough. I got this only beacuse i am a die hard batman fan, so in closing its a good collectors item but don't expect too much. Batman is american, lets keep it that way!

3149575,4,B001614F0S,"As a fan of both anime and Batman, I was thrilled to hear about this set months ago, and it did not dissappoint.

  Anime fans who are less open minded to American stories will dislike the storytelling, and American fans may be put-off by the animation; but if you are willing to appreciate the melding of different styles, you will like this.

  The Bob Kane Bio was interesting, but the villian feature provided no information that Batman fans didn't already know. All Batman the animated Series episodes included are great too. If you haven't picked up the sets of that series then this is worth it simply to get those episodes.

  I think most of the negative reviews are from people who had made up thier minds that they would dislike this from the begining (and after ""The Batman"" this does not surprise me) but if you come into it with an open mind you will like it.",1215561600,12,873,4.474683544303797
3149576,4,B001614F0S,"Overall it is a good DVD set. You have to get used to the Japanese style of animation. I did not like the way Bruce Wayne was drawn. That would be my only real complaint. It was a pleasant surprise to hear that Kevin Conroy was back to voice Bruce Wayne/Batman. He was the same actor who voiced those characters in Batman TAS. The stories are good. The first one I believe is a loose remake of the ""Legends of Batman"" episode. Every kid has his/her own idea of who Batman is. What was cool is that their stories are all related and you catch a new piece of the story each time it is told. You also see how Batman experiments with new gadgetry and some of his training. Definitely worth it if you are a Batman fan and enjoyable if you are not.",1215561600,3,742,4.124137931034483

3149578,4,B001614F0S,"Was really looking forward to this DVD so excited to view when I saw the trailers.  However, the ""anime-style"" scenes from the trailer, ""edited"" quickly with commentaries from the producers and DC staff, were not as exciting when viewed in the context of the entire DVD.

Positives of DVD:  1. The visuals of Gotham city were fantastic!!  One of the great things of Batman, the Animated Series (BTAS) were the backgrounds of the dark off-kilter buildings.  Here, in this DVD, they are drawn in such a way as to make Gotham look both beautiful and ugly.  This is felt/drawn/highlighted in all six vignettes.  2. The voice of Conroy as Batman.  His voice has so much texture... it is the ""voice of Batman."" 3. The last two stories are great.  Well illustrated and plotted they add to the ""Batman mythos."" 4. The updated designs of the costumes of both Batman and his villains in many of the episodes are interesting and unique.

Negatives:  I think that the negatives are derived from how this project was designed. The DVD is touted as a bridge for the upcoming summer 08 Batman movie and Batman Begins (In fact, the director, is the author of one of the middle episodes).  The vignettes are authored by well known American writers, overseen by the guys that brought you BTAS, and illustrated by well-known anime artist.  Although on the DVD, Timm and co. emphasized that they gave the anime artists full rein, it must have been difficult for them to work on these projects.  Imagine, as an artist, directing a very protected American icon"" whose every step has to be OK'ed by DC Comics, making sure it hypes a ""big-budget American summer movie,  following a script written in a foreign language and coordinating your animation with 5 other animators.  As an artist I would go crazy, I am surprised that the product came out as well as it did!!!

So given the obstacles listed above, my negatives are the following:  1. starting the DVD with an episode which plot is very similar to one of my favorite BTAS episodes. The episode from BTAS, in which three kids talk about their experience and POV of Batman is charmingly drawn in different ""Batman style;"" the original campy style, a gruffy Frank Miller style...etc.  That episode, funny and well drawn, makes this new anime episode suffer in comparison.  The episode is not funny at all and the kids and Batman are drawn in a stylistic manner that is almost too painful to watch  2. The middle episode, in which both Batman and Bruce Wane are drawn in the childlike ""anime"" style.  To see Bruce Wayne drawn looking like he is 15 years old (especially as the other characters look age-appropriate) was so distracting that I had a hard time following the plot. I know that that type of drawing is a Japanese construct, but the main theme and premise of the Batman myth is the loss of childhood and innocence when Bruce's parents are killed and the subsequent metaphorical ""birth"" of justice which is what Batman represents. Drawing Batman and Bruce in a childlike fashion is almost a direct contradiction of the myth.  I cannot visually digest the images of childlike Batman and Bruce, especially in the dark context of these episodes.",1215561600,5,3182,4.73502722323049
3149579,1,B001614F0S,"This is just a collection of random Batman cartoons. First off the animation is just horrible. Second, have the people who made these episodes ever even read a Batman comic. The stories are pitiful. The art in some of the episodes is passable, but mostly it just annoys. The first episode being the worst drawing I think I've ever seen, Ren & Stimpy was better done. If I go on any longer my review will seem like some hate-filled rant so I'm going to stop now. Trust me and DO NOT BUY this. Re-watching any episode from Batman: The Animated Series (Batman TAS) is better than seeing this for the first time.",1215561600,7,608,4.4375
3149580,4,B001614F0S,"I was expecting several different animated episodes that would introduce characters and tell complete stories.  What I got was several different animated episodes that were snapshots of events that helped shaped the Batman that we will see in the next movie.  Not that there isn't a fair amount of action - but I can see where the stories seem ""incomplete"".  It's because they are not meant to be tidy and complete but instead to show more of the psychology of the character.  Once you get your mind around that fact, you can potentially enjoy the episodes on the level I think they were intended.

Side Note:  When I see things like this I LONG for a good ANIMATED PG-13 or R Batman movie.  There are some things that live action/CG just can't do like animation!",1215561600,9,763,4.607407407407408

There is not much consistency from episode to episode, other than Batman's voice.  The episodes are short, yet slow, and rather pointless.  The last one is the best, but still nothing too memorable.  Aside from some good visuals here and there, there is really not much to latch onto with this.  It's a real snore.

3149582,4,B001614F0S,"Ever since I was 3 I have been a fan of Batman. I started with the Superfriends and the Adam West show all the way to the awesome worlds of Bruce Timm and Christopher Nolan. Now with the most anticipated film of 2008 on the way in 'The Dark Knight' Bruce Timm decided to join his world and Nolans' world with 'Batman: Gotham Knight' This film bridges 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' showing Batman's rise to legendary status as well as keeping an eye out of the other major characters, heroic and villanous.

This film does not bring the viewer the familiar Batman to the screen. It is something completly different that has never been done in the superhero media. Yes there have been many depictions of famous superheroes in the style of Manga and other anime styles, but in print never moving picture. I think that is why many people are giving this movie a very mixed review. The style of anime is a cut above the american traditional 2-D/3-D animation. The animation is original and stories make the characters much more complex. Sometimes the line drawn between good and evil or hero and villian is washed away due to dark heroes and villians with no intentions of mass genocide or world domination. The most familiar thing you see in this film is Kevin Conroy doing what he does best and eventhough it would have been cool to see Christian Bale in this role I was glad that Kevin returned.

I say this movie should be seen because it is so fresh and different. I always enjoy when people move a character out of his or her comfort zone. While this film isn't as good as Mask of the Phantasm or Return of the Joker (the other Bruce Timm Batman Movies), I thought it was well put together and I am eagerly awaiting the next Warner Premire film which is Wonder Woman.",1215561600,13,1776,4.478395061728395
3149583,5,B001614F0S,"I'm surprised at the tone of some of the negative reviews.  The common complaint was that some of the features are ""too boring.""  However, this feature is VERY similar to the pace of Batman Begins.  Lots of flash back... big fight WITHOUT the costume, gadget time with Lucius, Batman facing off against regular thugs and (eventually) his comic book villains, reflection on his internal conflict, Alfred as moral compass and big final battle on a train.  HELLO!?!?!?

Obviously, Joker is the quintessential Batman villain, but Nolan and Ledger's brand new take on the character preclude them from featuring that villain.  This effort is firmly placed in the LIVE ACTION universe, and some fans expecting a BTAS feature might be disappointed.  However, I have always found the Dini style to be too juvenile for the Timm scripts and was pleased to see such a fully realized production.

Overall, this is an EXCELLENT disc.  Adult fans of Batman and anime will be well pleased.

P.S.  As an aside, others have alluded to the ""youthful"" appearance of Wayne in the ""Field Test"" segment.  He does look like a teenager, but that is simply the nature of that style.  The story is solid and offers strong insight into the nature of Batman's integrity and character.",1215561600,4,1255,4.890995260663507
3149584,4,B001614F0S,"Contrary to other reviews, I found the first episode ""Have I Got a Story For You"" to be the highlight of this omnibus project. The story and design offered some very interesting and unusual re-envisioning of the Batman character. The style was inventive and pushed the envelope artistically. The shorts that followed had great moments, amazing action, welcome return of familiar voice actors, but overall relied on attitude over story. I just didn't get pulled into the moments they chose to put us into. The style of the animation also became more predictable, though admittedly, looked very very cool. I would have loved to have seen deeper stories, with equal conflict and action, that spoke more of Batman's emotional character, rather than the somewhat cartoony man-committed-to-fight-crime, one-note approach. I really liked watching this and it's worth checking out if you are a Batman or animation fan. And I wish they'd keep going with more! As past reviews show, there is a little something for everyone in a project like this, and you may find that other segments speak to you as a viewer.",1215561600,7,1100,5.016393442622951
3149585,3,B001614F0S,"It is very true that this is nothing new. Batman being turned into the Animatrix is still Batman. I am a Batman fan, but I think I was expecting more. The first story should have been completely left out. It is about kids telling there stories of when they first saw the Batman,but each kid has a different version as to what he looked like. The coolest thing about this movie is the return of Kevin Conroy. The downer is that the stories don't get interesting until the third.

Overall, this is an optional buy. It doesn't have anything to do with the upcoming movie, even though it is from the makers of the two Bale movies. If there is a connection, I didn't see it. They never reference Batman Begins, unless you count the Scarecrow on one story. I am a fan of Bruce Timm and what he has done with the DC animated universe, it is just a shame it didn't shine like most of his other work. On it's own, it's okay. If you are a major Batman fan, you will probably love it. If you are a casual or new fan wanting to like Batman, it being anime won't change your mind.",1215561600,4,1067,4.179611650485437

3149587,4,B001614F0S,"I will start off by saying it was one of the best animated Batman movies/series I have seen. The animation is what you would expect from anime the stereotypical anime animation but it was still good solid animation, which is a compliment from me because I really don't like anime.

 The first story was by far my least favorite. I thought it was kind of boring, it was the usual story of kids exagerating the truth. I don't want to really give the plot of anything away so I will avoid plot details. After watching the first one I was questioning if the movie was worth the money.

 After watching the second one I knew it was. The second cartoon was my favorite it had a good story, what I thought was the best animation out of them all and a good amount of action.

I'm not going to go through all six episodes because there isn't a lot to say other then plot details, but all around it was a really good set of short films on one of comics most iconic figures. I haven't really had a chance to go through the special features but on the two disc there is four episodes from one of the animated series (which for me was the selling point for the two disc). It was suposed to sum up what was going on between Batman Begins and Dark Knight, it doesn't tie the two together at all but it gives the viewer a better understanding of the crime and corruption going on in Gotham city. Again I think if you are a really big Batman fan whether it be the movies, comics/graphic novels, or the series I recomend this movie.",1215561600,10,1514,4.224913494809688

3149589,4,B001614F0S,"I am surprised at so many one star reviews.  I really do not know what to make of it, because at any level, this DVD is not that poor in writing or quality; however, I was both satisfied and in places a little disappointed.  The main film involves six stories woven into one narrative that last about hour and ten minutes.  The art work is generally good, but Batman is often drawn in an oft-kilted style.  So first, the disappointments: Now, I am just an amateur artists, but this style only works in short spurts (like one frame), not in multiple frames (where it starts to wear thin very quickly).  In one frame, it can draw the on-looker in, making one appreciate characteristics and points being made; however, in a film, this technique, I assert, begins to distract the viewer.

The stories are in and of themselves, pretty good; but, because they are small vignettes, they are not as good as the ""Animated Series"" from the early to mid 90s.  The story ""Working Through Pain"" is so esoteric, that its strength fails to deliver with its pretentious ending.  With that said, the rest of the DVD is very good and the stories hold up very well and while some stories involve a lot of action, some do not and this adds depth to the character - much like the comic book.  The best story is the last and that is true because it is also well told and the best ""drawn"".

The bio-epic on Bob Kane on disc two is really nice and one gets a good sense about the man and his life and journey.  There are some special ""animated"" series episodes and ""The Legends of the Dark Knight"" is similar to the first story on disk one, ""Do I have a Story to Tell"" (both of which are based loosely on ""The Batman Nobody Knows"" -Batman #250, 1973, Frank Robbins).

The animation is phenomenal - very dark, how Batman should be - but the stories just aren't good.  They go from bad to slightly better, but still never reach ""good"" by the end of the movie.  I found myself saying ""what was the point of that?"" at the end of every story, and couldn't really find any good reasons why this was even made.  This is pretty much a cash grab from the studios.  In comparison to The Animatrix, this one doesn't even stand up - Gotham Knight doesn't give you anything substantial - it doesn't deliver anything about the character that we don't already know, and it doesn't even reiterate the point very well.

It appears to have been done by the same person who brought us ""Batman: The Long Halloween."" Now, I could be wrong as THAT art made me what to retch and I wasn't interested in finding out anything about it. I can't possible figure out why DC would give that guy another project. (Oh, wait. Of course, he's nouveau; he's fresh; he's cutting edge! My gosh we should all bow to the triumph of his artistic achievement.)

3149594,4,B001614F0S,"With The Dark Knight just around the corner, Warner Bros. and DC has released another more than solid, direct to DVD animated feature with Batman: Gotham Knight.  A collection of six interlocking stories featuring various writing and animator talent, Gotham Knight gets off to a bit of a rocky start, but winds up being a thoroughly entertaining ride while it lasts.  ""Have I Got a Story For You"", with a script from A History of Violence screenwriter Josh Olson, revolves around a group of kids and their stories about encountering Batman in action.  The story and animation here aren't really anything special, but thankfully things get better from here on forward.  ""Crossfire"", with a script from acclaimed comic writer Greg Rucka, finds detectives Allen and Ramirez caught in the middle of a gang-war between mob factions, with Batman in the middle as well.  ""Field Test"", with a script from Jordan Goldberg, features a ridiculously young Bruce Wayne putting new gadgets from Lucius Fox to use, while Batman Begins and Blade writer David Goyer contributes the excellent ""In Darkness Dwells"", where Batman takes on the Scarecrow and Killer Croc.  Comic writer Brian Azzarello contributes ""Working Through Pain"", which is an intriguing look at Bruce's past lessons to overcome physical pain, and the excellent finale entitled ""Deadshot"" is written by classic animated series writer Alan Burnett and features a bloody face-off between Batman and the gun-toting assassin of the title name.  The various animation techniques used throughout may not be everyone's cup of tea (some will certainly thrill you more than others), but as a whole Gotham Knight is a dark (and surprisingly violent) blast.  The Two-Disc Special Edition features some spectacular extras that are worth the price of admission alone, including a fascinating documentary going over Batman's rogues gallery, a documentary about Batman creator Bob Kane, and four great episodes from the classic 90's animated series.  All in all, Batman: Gotham Knight will tide you over (briefly) during the wait for The Dark Knight, and Batman fans should definitely give it a look.  Be warned however if you're a parent: Gotham Knight is a surprisingly mature and violent animated feature that more than likely should not be viewed by young children.",1215475200,26,2305,5.205405405405405
3149595,3,B001614F0S,"I had high expectations for this flick, but, I must say I was disappointed.  The animation was mediocre, and the story was slow moving.  But, it was very happy to have Kevin Conroy voicing the Dark Knight.",1215475200,7,205,4.513513513513513

Its an in between-er that links the two Batman films. The production is outstanding. Its done in various jap-anime styles and give a good deal of depth to the already deep batman persona developed from the Batman Begins Film. Pretty hardcore for a animated film. The various visual takes on the characters appearance is really interesting.

If u don't feel the need to buy, at least rent b4 u see the new batman film. Thou, i still recommend u buy if u are a batman fan.",1215475200,4,530,4.510416666666667
3149597,3,B001614F0S,"wow, very dissapointing but its still ok.
The animation was beautiful but most of the stories were dull and boring for the exception of a couple or so and i love Batman.

the first story with the little kids was ok but it just wasn't "" Batman"" to me, I felt like i was watching PBS or something. The animation or art was nice looking but the story was ok. my rating: 3/5

the second story was alright but the first few minutes were dull and boring, i thought the two detectives were boring charcters.but then i saw batman at the end and that was probably the best part.but in the end, it wasn't very good, and lets keep in mind these stories are about 12 min or so, my rating for this 3/5

the third one was much better than the first 2, although parts of it were dull, the scenes with batman were really cool, the action was cool but i wish i could of seen more of Batman. this story was good but dissapointing. I liked the design of batman on this one.
my rating 3.5/5

the 4th story was also pretty descent , batman looked cool in this story. I didn't like how killer croc and scarecrow looked and how they were used in this story but its was still descent, but the story is just way too short. my rating 3.5/5

the fifth story sucked big time balls, it was very dull and boring .it wasn't a very good story at all, it wasn't entertaining. I didn't like it at all, the only good parts were the scenes with batman. my rating 1.5/5

the 6th and last story was the best and it was very cool. in this one batman must face an assasin named deadshot. Batman's design looks very cool in this story and i think its the best design. deadshot is a very cool villain. the action scenes were cool. this was well written but my only complain is that it was just way too short. This is is what the entire ""movie"" should of been like. It would of been awesome to see deadshot vs batman more than once. It would of been much better had their been a bigger plot and a bigger story instead of having six stories. the 6th story gets a rating of 4.5/5

the entire 70 minute or so movie should of been the sixth story They should of taken the 6th story and expand it to 70 minutes. That way we could of had a very cool Batman anime film. 12 min was not enough. this idea of six stories by six different people was sort of a good idea but it just didn't work out right.bad excecution.

i'll probably wait until this dvd gets cheaper and buy the two disc dvd, which comes with 4 episodes from Batman The Animated Series, now thats the type of story telling that this film was missing.

overall 3/5 stars",1215302400,7,2583,4.139720558882235
3149598,5,B001614F0S,"To be frank I only liked the second half of the film. The first half constists of nothing but the view of Batman through the eyes of various civilians, and Batman beating up goons.

The second half or the last two stories are far more enjoyable. Working Through Pain was written by one of my favourite comic book writers Brian Azarello (100 Bullets), and he did a good job in annunciating that Bruce really doesn't want to work through the pain of his parents death. He wants to hold on to that pain because it gives him purpose and it drives him. And really if he were to give up that pain--he probably would find his life devoid and meaningless and purposeless. The Deadshot story, I liked because it shows the kind of Alpha male hero who is willing to stand down any threat (yet not a goon) warrior I like to see him portrayed as.",1214870400,16,833,4.339743589743589
3149599,1,B001614F0S,"I had pre-ordered this DVD Saturday, July 28th and that night I went to a free screening for Batman: Gotham Knight in Wizard World Chicago.

Tonight I removed it from my Amazon orders. Batman: Gotham Knight does not live up to the hype. Producer Bruce Timm and company have delivered a 6-part turkey.

As each of the 6 stories in this animated movie played out I expected the stories to get better and better. Sadly, instead they got less and less terrible. Believe me, there is a difference.

Not even Greg Rucka, a man who wrote classic Batman crime stories a few years back, could deliver on a project that sorely needed some substance. The closet thing to a sucess was the story written by 100 Bullets scribe Brian Azzarello in which Batman flashes back to his pain endurance training as a young Bruce Wayne.

However the worst crime in the 6-chapter feature was committed by writer Josh Olsen's ""Have I Got a Story for You"". In this tale a few young children each tell exaggerated stories about who Batman really is. Sound familiar? Well it should because producer Bruce Timm has produced the exact same story before in the 90's for Batman: The Animated series with the episode: Legends of the Dark Knight--a piece of animation much more lively than this bland throwaway tale Mr. Olsen has the gall to submit us to! To add insult to the viewer's injury, the Legends of the Dark Knight episode was based on a Batman story from the 70's Batman comics, ""The Batman Nobody Knows"" by Frank Robbin and Dick Giordano (reprinted in The Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told). And that story too was also a better executed tale. Shame on you Josh Olsen.

Avoid this DVD altogether or wait for it to end up as a bargin on Amazon market place. I have a feeling that it will be dirt cheap to get by Christmas.",1214784000,4,1798,4.537037037037037
3149600,5,B001614F0S,"*This does contain some minor spoilers. I tried not to spoil too much.*

Batman: Gotham Knight is advertised as the missing link between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. There are six stories in total. Each story is by different artists, but they all link together and flow together nicely.

The first story is called, ""Have I got a story for you,"" and involves a boy waiting for his friends to arrive. Once they do, each one of them tells a story about what they saw today and they all saw Batman. Each story is farfetched in its own way as this story capitalizes on teenagers stretching the truth and/or having overactive imaginations. It seems their day isn't finished though as the fight they all witnessed makes its way to that very skate park.

""Crossfire"" is the story of Chris and Anna being apart of Lieutenant Gordon's MCU (Major Crime Unit). Chris thinks Batman is a vigilante that takes the law into his own hands while Anna is still unsure about him and is just thankful that good cops that know how to do their job are actually being respected now that Batman has shown up. After taking a recent Arkham escapee back to the asylum, they soon realize they're stuck in the middle of a gang war between Sal Maroni and The Russian.

""Field Test"" begins with Lucius Fox showing Bruce Wayne some new gadgets. Amongst them is a harness equipped with an electromagnetic pulse strong enough to deflect bullets. Batman decides to test it out with Maroni, The Russian, and his goons. Everything is going Batman's way until a certain...glitch...happens.

""In Darkness Dwells"" has everyone looking for a monster. Killer Croc, to be exact. Apparently, he was the former patient of a certain Johnathan Crane. Coincidentally, one of the reasons he was admitted to Dr. Crane was for his fear of bats. Go figure.

Batman is injured on what seems like any other night he puts on his mask in ""Working Through Pain."" We're basically shown how tenacious he really is as he struggles with his injuries. We're also shown a few flashbacks of his past and soon learn the difference between exterior and interior pain. There's a way to put pain in its place and this is how Bruce Wayne found out how.

""Deadshot"" has come back to Gotham and has set his sights on Jim Gordon, but it looks like he has ulterior motives. Bruce Wayne also gives his views on guns.

Gotham Knight is superb. There's really no other way to describe it. I had my doubts about it, but I think those were blown away during the first few minutes of the film. The animation is fantastic. Everything moves crisply and smoothly. It just seems to flow. And let me just say that it's amazing to hear Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman again. It's like a homecoming in so many ways.

The biggest question you may be asking yourself is how can all the stories actually flow together since they're all done by different artists. The truth is that other than the artistic style changing, you don't really notice anything. The voice cast stays the same throughout the entire film and while each individual story has its own story to tell, they're all connected in some way and flow together nicely.

Gotham Knight is a feature that shouldn't be missed by anybody. Whether you're an anime fan, a Batman fan, or you're just looking for something new to catch your eye, I'd recommend Gotham Knight to anyone and everyone. The animation is beautiful and has a real crisp flow to it while the stories are written incredibly well and will keep you interested. The voice cast is also something worth mentioning. Other than seeing Kevin Conroy come back as Batman, the rest of the cast does a great job as well. My one complaint is that it doesn't really bridge the gap between anything. However, it doesn't really seem to bridge the gap between anything and is just an excellent stand alone animated feature.",1214784000,71,3853,4.636363636363637
3149601,5,B001614F0S,"At last a decent Batman cartoon after Batman: The Animated Series! Kevin Conroy, the true Batman voice, Bruce Timm, the man who created BTAS, Alan Burnett, the guy that made some of the best Batman stories, are all here to this latest Batman anime feature! Ive been watching Batman since 1992 (BTAS) and as many of you i felt that ""The Batman"" was a discrace to the original! So i HIGHLY recomend this one to all who just want to see Batman as the way they know he is! Many bonuses are included in the 2nd DVD like: 4 Batman The Animated series episodes, a tribute to Bob Kane, a discusion about the villains, a sneek peek of the new Wonder Woman feature and trailers!

Each story has a different take on Batman's story. And Kevin Conroy is the excellent choice, to do his voice, he can sound sound so menancing and intimidating. I just wish it was a lot longer, seems like most of the Batman animated movies, or direct to video ones seem to be around that 75 or 76 minute length. Only wish they could make it least two hours. And I wish they would bring a Batman animated movie to the movie theatre, I think ""Mask of the Phantasm"" was the only one.

3383747,3,B001614F0S,"I grew up watching Batman the animated series and I've seen most of the major Hollywood batman films and recently I have been revisiting the batman animated series of my youth with my kids.  When I saw this DVD I thought it would be a great combination of animation with the Christian Bale batman universe.

I did enjoy most of the short story cartoons but, I felt their were several factors that really injured its overall presentation.  The screenwriting of the Batman animated series did not have batman speaking much but the things he said many edifying things that were overall good moral messages.  I am sure that a close analysis of these short stories could find something in them with a good moral message, but only one of the short stories really had something close to it when batman abandons the use of a gadget that while making him very protected might endanger others.

Some of the short stories seemed artsy (and I am not talking about the animation) like the hindi guru one, but others struck me as having a good overall short story feel (deadshot). Perhaps the diversity might appeal to others peoples taste, but I would have preferred a more focused approached to the story telling.",1443916800,3,1201,4.7

Field Test: Lucious Fox and Batman have new toys to try out. Will they work as advertised?

3383798,4,B001614F0S,"Gotham Knight is an incredible and creative animated film consisting of 6 segments. Despite not being a huge fan of anime, the studios do a wonderful job with the animation most of the time. The voice acting is also very top notch and Kevin Conroy is incredible as always in each segment as The Bat. It isn't perfect and some of the segments aren't quite as good as the others, but the film as a whole is incredible.

1. Have I Got a Story for You
Kicking off the film is what is probably the most ambitious and probably the most polarizing segment of the movie. Have I Got a Story for You  consists of three kids telling stories to one of their friends about their encounter with Batman earlier that day as he was battling The Man in Black. Each of the three kids' stories interlock (being told in reverse order) and they all have opposing views on what they think Batman is (a vampire, a Man-Bat, or a Robot). To me this one is incredible and probably the most interesting of all the segments. With an incredibly creative story and solid animation, Have I Got a Story for You stands out in fantastic fashion amongst the other segments. - 9.5/10

2. Crossfire
Following the incredible introduction comes Crossfire. This segment focuses on two cops with opposing views on Batman, one believing he has helped the city and the other who believes he's just vigilante the police shouldn't associate with. On their way back from transporting The Man in Black (the villain in Have I Got a Story for You) to prison, the two get caught in the middle of a dispute between the Russian Mobsters and Sal Maroni's men. While not as great as Have I Got a Story for You, Crossfire manages to be intense and entertaining (despite a slow start) and is also very wonderfully animated featuring some of the best imagery of the entire anthology. The stand off between the two cops, Sal Maroni, and Batman is also incredibly intense and fun to watch. It's a bit of a drop off from the first segment, but Crossfire is still a good and solid addition in Gotham Knight. - 7.5/10

3. Field Test
Now here is where it gets tricky. Field Test had a ton of potential. In this one Bruce Wayne is gifted with a new piece of equipment from Lucious Fox that can deflect bullets from any small caliber weapons (pistols etc.). However one night the device works too well and injures one of the criminals Batman encounters. This one could have been great, they could have really focused on Batman's no kill policy as well as the guilt that he may have killed someone. The opportunity is wasted as we don't really see any of that, and the henchmen who is injured doesn't even seem to be in any serious condition. Top that off with the animators' horrible decision to give Bruce Wayne an extremely boyish appearance that doesn't match Kevin Conroy's voice at all and Batman a weird awkward costume, and you got probably the weakest segment of the anthology. - 3.5/10

4. In Darkness Dwells
Fortunately, In Darkness Dwells is able to recapture some of the steam from the first two segments that Field Test lacked. When a Cardinal is kidnapped, Batman must venture out into the sewers, which is contaminated by Scarecrowe's fear gas, to save him. The premise is simple, but it still manages to be entertaining and is one again beautifully animated. The big problem with this one, though, is the ending kinda just happens. Its immediate and straight to the point which isn't bad, but here it feels rushed. Also when Batman is contaminated by the fear gas, it doesn't hinder him at all, which kinda makes the entire sewer setting a whole lot less frightening. It's very sloppy, but considering what it followed and also considering how well done the animation is, In Darkness Dwells is passable. It may not stand out, but it doesn't fail to entertain. - 6/10

5.  Working through Pain
Now here is where Gotham Knight comes back swinging.  In this segment Batman is wounded and wandering the underground as he is phoning in Alfred to come retrieve. Working Through Pain , though, is more a story about Bruce Wayne than it is Batman. While he wanders underground, the story flashes back to a time where Bruce is still searching to be trained for his future as Batman. Here Bruce is accepted by a woman named Cassandra who teaches Bruce how to subdue his pain. Working Through Pain is a stand out here. It is easily the most character focused of the six segments and offers the most insight on who Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman really is. The story is phenomenal and its animation top notch. It's alot quieter in terms of action, but the character focus as well as the meaningful ending more than make up for that. - 9.75/10

6. Deadshot
The final segment is also the loudest one. Deadshot is of course about Batman trying to stop an assassination by the notoriously accurate Deadshot. This one is more like one big action scene, but it's a very cool one too say the least. The story is simple like In Darkness Dwells, but the showdown between Batman and Deadshot is awesome and readily the best of the movie. Also Deadshot is wonderfully animated and is probably the best when it comes to looks. Deadshot is also a very entertaining villain and its just so awesome to see him do his thing. This segment satisfies the need for a great fight and nicely wraps up the whole film with a very bloody bow on top. - 8.75/10",1408233600,,5367,4.5476190476190474

3383806,2,B001614F0S,"Six interlocking episodes in slightly different manga styles. Though probably popular with the Batman crowd, I disliked it. Murky, often stiff, blocky, sometimes CGI, sometimes not, the stories are unclear. Voice cast changes, each has a different director, often with radically different styles.
  While I loved the previous Batman animated films (even the poorly done Batman vs. Dracula), this Gotham Knight just doesn't work for me.
  Far more appreciated were the documentaries that were on the second disc. Much analysis of the character, especially the villains. That is a documentary to study.
  The feature film was one that I had been eyeing for some years, but now that I have seen it I don't like it. Perhaps it is too dark (literally and metaphorically), and I prefer a straightforward story that is not so dark as this. But the animators keep trying to make Batman darker and darker; so much that people don't like the character anymore. This film encourages me to switch to a sweet Disney film instead. {How about Bruce Wayne singing ""Let It Go""?}. The film was visually and structurally unclear--perhaps more like a person's nightmare, which does not have a logic to them. Often I found the drawing to be crude.
  In addition, the second disc had 4 episodes from Batman The Animated series from the 1990s. These only reminded how much better that series was to this feature film, and inspired me to buy all 4 box sets of Batman: The Animated Series--far more entertaining.",1399766400,,1487,4.92

3383814,4,B001614F0S,"Batman: Gotham Knight is a series of stories, each of them from a different writer and director and with a different animation style. This was released in conjunction with the ""Batman Begins"" movie and you can see the influence of the movie on some of these episodes.

Episode 1: ""Have I Got a Story For You"" - The movie opens in a graffiti-scrawled, indoor skateboard park, where a group of four friends are meeting, each with a different story to tell about an encounter with Batman. The amusing thing is that each encounter is filtered through a child's imagination, where each child sees something different: a Batman who is a living shadow with glowing eyes, who rises out of the ground and just as quickly melts back into it again, a Batman who is an actual bat man, complete with flapping leathery wings, and a Batman who is an armored, morphing, bat-robot, for example.

I've omitted most of the details, of course, and there are some surprises in the various scenes, particularly the ending. The notion that kids like these would see different things isn't entirely new but it's well-executed and the various versions of Batman are amusing, particularly when you contrast it to what you know really happened. The backgrounds are incredibly detailed and elaborate and the figures very stylized. This is a departure from anything the studio has put out before but I think it works.

Episode 2: Crossfire - Detectives Allen and Ramirez have to transport a criminal captured by Batman back to jail. A disgruntled Allen makes his displeasure with the assignment and with a certain ""vigilante"" obvious. It's clear from the conversations that this is early in Batman's career, before he had established himself, and there are wide differences of opinion as to the impact he's having on the city and what to do about him. In the return from the drop-off, the detectives find themselves in the middle of a gang shootout, a shootout that is interrupted by the arrival of the Batman.

The backgrounds in this episode are more cartoonish and, surprisingly for Gotham City, brighter and more colorful, with spotlights sweeping the skies and well-lit skyscrapers in the background, while the foreground always remains dark and shadowed. The music in this episode is particularly noteworthy, changing to fit the mood, from insane shrieks to tuneful hosannas.

Episode 3: Field Test - Lucius Fox has a few technological surprises for Bruce Wayne, including an electromagnetic device strong enough to deflect a bullet, something that a young Batman is clearly interested in. There's only one problem....

This episode seemed to me to be a little bit more anime-influenced, particularly with respect to the character designs. A very young-looking Bruce Wayne would not have been out of place in any episode of Naruto. The Batman, too, is unlike any other rendition of Batman, with the cowl, in particular, unique.

Episode 4: In Darkness Dwells - A church is attacked by an 8-foot ""lizard man"" who came out of the crypts. Batman follows into the sewers, to find that the lizard man is very real and that he has an ally... This is a very odd episode, with hallucinogenic images and vivid colors, sharp contrasts and deep shadows. You're never quite sure what's real and what isn't.

Episode 5: Working Through Pain - A bleeding, exhausted Batman stumbles through the sewers, all the while having flashbacks to various scenes in his past. The primary flashback is of being taught a lesson about pain. There are some genuinely lovely scenes in this episode and it's more thought-provoking than any of the others.

Episode 6: Deadshot - The assassin is in town and he's aiming for Jim Gordon ... or is he? The train and tunnel sequences, in particular, are spectacular, but I was a bit disappointed with the ending.

I love it when an animation studio takes risks, and this movie certainly falls into that category. This is unlike anything the studio has ever done and, for the most part, it works. The mood, the animation style, the at times lovely artwork, the characterizations, all come together remarkably successfully, all things considered. The music fits the various stories very well and the voice characterizations are all spot-on, with the ever-impressive Kevin Conroy as Batman.

So what didn't I like? Well, it really is just a set of stories with no real overarching theme or arc to them and some of the stories I would describe as snapshots, rather than fully-fleshed stories. I'm also troubled by the lack of variety of mood; everything is deep, significant, dark, and brooding. While that does describe Batman, there is more to him and to his story than that. Despite this, I still regard this as a movie well worth seeing, if only to see these different visions of Batman come to life.",1392163200,2,4790,4.893958076448828

Review by A.P. Fuchs

Okay, now this is how you do something new with a character and do it right and totally change the formula. Not only was the style of Batman animation changedthis whole movie is done in anime by genuine Japanese anime directorsbut also instead of giving us one big story, why not give us six shorter ones in the same universe?

This flick was meant as a bridge between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, giving audiences an in-depth glimpse into Batmans past and what hes been up to between those two movies. To make it even sweeter, Kevin Conroy voices Batman for all six short films.

They are (and what I thought):

Have I Got a Story for You -

Premise: A bunch of skater kids relate to each other firsthand encounters with the Dark Knight.

Really good, each story seeming to center around Batman chasing the same thief. The art direction is ridiculous! Did you see the backgrounds in this thing? While the character designs for this vignette were so-so, the backgrounds were insane. What makes this vignette special is it shows how the Batman legend was born, that is, people swapping stories, relating what they thought they saw versus what really happened, and how one tale leads to another until, eventually, Batman is myth and man combined.

Of course, sometimes the facts get straightened out, as per the ending of this story. Youll have to see for yourself what I mean.

Crossfire -

Premise: Two cops take a recently-dropped-off-by-Batman felon to the Narrows for incarceration. There they encounter tons of trouble and Batman comes to the rescue.

This one is much grittier than the previous story, focusing heavily on the cops and gangs. The art is superb and while the backgrounds are more classical animation, the character design is top notch and I really dig how everyone looks in this tale. Batman is boss in this: big, powerful, sleek, toughwish he looked like this all the time. Well done.

The main point of the story is the question: is Batman an ally? One cop thinks so, the other is skeptical, and the conclusion reached? Well, youll just have to see this wicked cartoon for yourself.

Field Test -

Premise: Lucius Fox shows Bruce Wayne some new gear he can use as Batman and he gets a chance to do just that.

How does anyone draw this good? The backgrounds are so realistic its upsetting (in that good way). The character design is very classic anime: pointier noses, smaller eyes, very realistic body proportions.

Batman definitely has a unique style to his suit in this; not your classic uniform but it works. I also like the change of pace by showing his eyes instead of having just whites. I think this is the first time Batmans been animated that way.

All in all, this vignette was great and there is a moral to the story about Batmans stance on guns and how he understands the need to defend himself against them . . . but not at anothers expense.

In Darkness Dwells -

Premise: When a congregation starts going crazy during a church service, Batman thinks the Scarecrow is to blame. Instead, hes greeted by someone far more dangerous: Killer Croc! However, Scarecrow is still waiting in the wings.

Visually, this vignette is very comic-book-like. I see glimpses of Mike MignolasHellboy artist and creatorstyle though I doubt that the animators were trying to imitate that. Its just what it reminds me of.

This one was pretty exciting. Lots of action, lots of danger, lots of Batman stopping baddies and getting out of tight situations. Dig it.

Working Through Pain -

Premise: Suffering from a gunshot wound, Batman flashes back to before he donned the cowl and reflects on pain and what it means in his life physically and emotionally.

This ones pretty gory, but thats to further cement the point of this tale: pain . . . and what it does for Batman, how he deals with it and how he overcomes it. Giving glimpses into Bruce Waynes travels and the training he picked up along the way, we get to see the lengths he went to to perfect his body in the areas of enduring through painphysical and emotionalsomething he no doubt knew he needed to do if he was to succeed in his mission. Except, there is one pain he cant overcome.

Visually, I liked the art style of this one as well.

Deadshot -

Premise: Deadshot comes to Gotham and the word is hes going to assassinate Jim Gordon. When the GCPD catch wind of this, they let Batman know. Batman becomes Gordons shadow and resolves to keep his friend safe.

The art direction in this is like a high-end comic book come to life. Really, really liked it. Great line work, crisp images, solid colors, dark and bleak like a Batman comic. Awesome. And that train tunnel? Gotta be a 3D background but it looks unbelievably cool.

The Batman-vs-Deadshot battle is a sweet one, high speed on a train.

The main thrust of this story is about guns and how Batman feels about them. Since it was a gun that killed his parents, its a touchy area for him.

All six of these stories were well done, well thought out and well written. Im proud to be a Batman fan while watching these and Im equally happy DC tried something new with the character and succeeded in spades. By tying this animated flick into the live action ones, it added a whole new dimension to those stories and to these animated shorts as well.

3383826,4,B001614F0S,"I read some other reviews about this being similar to the Animatrix, so I knew going into it what it would be like. Since I like that style of animation, I ordered this and it seems pretty good. A word of advice though, order directly through Amazon. The 3rd-party ""B68 Solutions Limited"" will try to sell you the UK version. As long as you order directly from Amazon, everything should be fine.

This has 6 short animated stories. Not really tying to the Nolan movies as much as WB advertises. But they are good entertainment regardless.",1379030400,5,538,4.604166666666667
3383827,5,B001614F0S,"When I first started watching Batman - Gotham Knight, I thought I had the wrong DVD in the player, because the animation and story was not what I expected.  After having watched the first 2 movies in the Justice League series (Superman:Doomsday and Justice League:A New Frontier), I expected a similar type of story with similar animation.  This movie couldn't be more different than the others.

Essentially, the movie is made up of 6 short vignettes (about 15 minutes each) in which Batman's rise to superhero status is explored.  He starts out as just a figment of some kids' imaginations and becomes a force against evil in his own right by the end of the series.  The movies are dark, somber, and action packed.  There is a lot of imagery which is fascinating to watch and thought-provoking to consider.  I particularly liked ""Working Through Pain"" and ""Deadshot"", the 5th and 6th episodes in the series of mini-movies.  They nicely tie together the others and help you to see Batman become a full-fledged hero, while at the same time allowing you to see where he came from.

The storylines and dialogue are not simple in this movie and it's important to listen carefully and digest what is said.  There are many themes which refer to how Batman became what he is, and these themes need to be explored and thought about.  I'd venture to say that this movie is one that you should watch more than once, but not just based upon enjoyment, but out of necessity so you can understand it better.

My hat goes off to those that conceived of Batman Gotham Knight and created and developed the movie.  It's truly fascinating and worth watching.  It will make you think of Batman like you never have before.",1378771200,,1703,4.671140939597316

3383841,2,B001614F0S,"Batman Gotham Knight is the second film in the DC animated direct-to-DVD line-up. Superman Doomsday was the first in that line-up. While, I did not find it great, I was entertained by the film. I overall thought it was okay. Gotham Knight, however, I was very disappointed with. Since I liked Superman Doomsday, I had high hopes that the creators would learn from their mistakes with that film, and this movie would be better. However, what I got was a very disjointed mess.

Gotham Knight is six separate stories in one film. Honestly, that is probably the biggest problem with the film. There is no wrap around where all the stories tie in. The stories are very self-contained. This does not feel like a complete film.

To make it worse half of the stories are uninteresting and also poorly animated. A different animator worked on each story. In some stories the animation was great, but in other, it is mediocre or just bad.

I'm not a fan of ""I've got a story to tell you,"" ""Field Test,"" or ""Working Through Pain."" I'm not a fan of the animation and I do not find the stories engaging. When those stories were playing I was wanting to fall asleep. I do like ""Crossfire,"" ""In Darkness Dwells,"" and ""Deadshot."" I liked the animation and the action scenes. So all-in-all the stories are a very mixed bag.

The voice acting was good. Kevin Conroy comes back to voice Batman, which is a plus. He is easily one of the best aspects about the film. The animation is a mixed-bag, like I mentioned earlier. The action is also a mixed bag. In some stories the action is good, but in others it is boring.

Overall, I'm going to have to say that you should skip this one. There are many better animated Batman movies to check out like Mask of the Phantasm, Return of the Joker, Under the Red Hood, etc.",1367452800,,1794,4.49079754601227

3383845,4,B001614F0S,"This was an interesting adaptation to the animated Batman genre.  It combines the edge of your seat excitement and spectacle of Director Chris Nolans live action Batman films as well as the human drama and gritty intrigue of visionary Japanese anime.  The two-disc DVD starts off with six animated shorts combined into one unique feature that explores the origins of the Dark Knights universe.  Although, I have to say that the first segment Have I got a Story for You where these inner-city kids were talking about their perceptions of the legendary vigilante, was a waste of time and totally unnecessary.  However, the other five origin stories were definitely much more enjoyable.  Similar to the live-action 2005 film Batman Begins we see a young Bruce Wayne travelling the world looking for spiritual enlightenment and the physical martial artist skills needed to survive the crime-ridden streets of a disheveled Gotham City.  Here, the characters voice hasn't lost its edge after twenty-years; meaning voice over actor Kevin Conroy, whom is once again at the helm bringing life to the iconic animated Bruce Wayne/Batman.
Unfortunately, the overall appearance of the Wayne character has suffered a severe identity crisis: looking more like the character from the anime cartoon Monster rather than the charming more masculine version of Bruce Wayne.  Aside from that, the remainder of the story from the action sequences to the stunning real-world city landscapes that are Gotham is outstanding!  This is where the artistry of Japanese animation comes into its own, creating natural and very realistic environments.  Its an art form that is desperately lacking in the United States where most animators of today are sadly leaning towards creating cartoons in a computer rather than drawing believable characters on a paper canvas.
 The best part of the DVD for me, was the behind the scenes segment Batman and Me with Batman creator Bob Kane, a revealing glimpse into how the legendary caped crusader became one of the most famous crime-fighting super heroes of all time.  There is also a short segment that delves into the chilling psychology of some of Gotham Citys most infamous villains.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of the Batman cartoons or even the live-action films.  It may not be the Batman animation that were used to but its well worth the time to watch and enjoy an iconic hero in a darker, more grittier Gotham City.",1365552000,,2456,5.034567901234568

Gotham Knight is a collection of six stories that supposedly tell us what Batman was up too, prior to battling the Joker in the Dark Knight. What I really love about Nolan's Batman movies is how realistic they are, and while Gotham Knight uses the same names and story line, it is anything but realistic. These stories are downright childish and boring. It's like reading Batman's diary and seeing his conversations and what he did at work today, some stories were better than others, but I was pretty much reading Batman's Twitter and it was as dull and simplistic as could be.",1361491200,,845,4.677852348993288

3383855,3,B001614F0S,"Fans of The Animatrix will feel right at home with this Blu-Ray; At heart, this is another collection of short stories (loosely connected) outsourced to several prominent Japanese animation studios to bring new, exciting, fresh images of The Batman to American soils.  It's actually quite interesting to see how other studios see Batman.  I certainly can't say it's for everyone; the styles shift so often that it'd be difficult for traditional Batman fans to get a grasp of anything long enough to leave an impression, and would probably come off as confusing.  It doesn't help that the storyline's actually pretty meh, overall.  The stories are loosely based on the universe created by the new trilogy, and it isn't necessary to see this to enjoy the movie installments.

It kinda feels like a cash grab, but it's a fun cash grab if you can suspend your preconceptions.  This is a unique experience that you can't get anywhere else.  Styles shift from styles that will be recognizable by Anime fans; for instance, the first segment was clearly done by the same studio that did Tekkonkinkreet.  A later segment smacks of the studio that did the animation for Aeon Flux; in fact, if you've seen The Animatrix, many of the segment stylings will look uncannily similar.  Because they are.

It's clear that not as much care was put into THIS as was The Animatrix to bring a coherent product together, probably because these segments didn't have the luxury of being self-contained, but were instead weakly stitched together story-wise.  This jarring fact compounds with the abrupt shifts between studios.

However, as a package, it stands up.  The extras range from interesting to EXCELLENT, behind the scenes aside.  As is often the case with DCU releases, Bruce Timm included relatable episodes of The Animated Series.  The theme of the four episodes included appear to be, well, the most visually striking episodes of the series.  The first was a three-part episode that, in the vein of Batman: Gotham Knight itself (or should we say this was in the vein of the Animated Series episode?) multiple EXISTING styles were emulated in a collection of stories, the first being in the classical 50s (?) style, and the LATTER...

...and this is awesome...

An animated short tale from The Dark Knight Returns.  Featuring Frank Miller-esque animation, and Batman voiced by, I kid you not, Michael Ironside.

AWESOME.

The other episodes are equally entertaining, including a fantastic, beautiful showdown with Mr. Freeze, a bizarre What-If scenario where Batman's cover is blown in spectacular fashion, and a bit of a pity-party in the last where Batman does some soul searching.  The latter's not so great of an episode, but the other three more than make up for 'em.  I'm assuming the last two were put in to further explore the relationship between Bruce and Gordon.  But come on, MICHAEL IRONSIDE.

I really love how the extras bring the DCU animated features together.  These guys know how to make good use of Blu-Ray media, and you definitely get your money's worth when you get this.

If you can enjoy the core experience.  If you're looking for something along the lines of The Animated Series, outside of the extras, you're probably going to be disappointed.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  And then I hit the extras, and that's all she wrote.",1356825600,,3338,4.919499105545617

3383860,1,B001614F0S,"this bills itself as some sort of missing link between batman begins and the dark knight. now that in theory sounds good and is enough to get most people excited sadly that is just a bold faced lie.

there are 5-6 short stories i can't remember how many.

the first problem is this makes 0 reference to batman begins. not one single reference which makes its linking ability between the two movies impossible.

the second problem is why in the heck is there a different animation style for each story?

the third problem is the animation is of questionable quality at times. sometimes it is smooth and great and other times it looks clunky usually when it comes to any hand to hand fighting which considering japanese anime does not have this problem and this is done in the style of said anime it really sticks out like a sore thumb.

the only real stand out if the first short story which will lure you into a false sense of security since that one is fairly good and could of been the start of a good link between the two movies but since it like the others is only 10-20 minutes that ends and it moves onto some other unrelated story.

the stories are largely unrelated, have no connection to the two movies it claims to be linking and the overall writing is just a giant mess. it really is just batman tracking down villians which is not bad in and of itself it is just this is billed as a link between the two movies and it does not do that anywhere at all. this fills in none of the holes between the two movies which makes these episodes just random pointless batman stories. had this been advertised as 6 random batman stories i'd be less ticked off. and no i am not going to watch the commentary in special features just to have this explained if the episodes themselves can't do that they fail.

then we have special features....4 episodes of batman the animated series....only the first one of the list even remotely fits the theme of how batman becomes the legendary dark knight which is ironic as only the first of the 5 or 6 short stories fits that theme too. there is also some commentary and other stuff.

overall a really terrible product i spent 8 bucks on the blu ray and i feel that was too much. i don't know what these 5 star reviews are on about this is a complete giant walking mess this is as bad as if you walked in your hung over friends and they have puked all over your floor and bathroom. it really is just that bad.

Totally awesome. They are upscaled so you will see some jagged lines and still some debris on the film, but it's still slightly upgraded over the DVD quality previously released of this Dark Deco masterpiece.

There is also a great documentary on Batman's Rogue Gallery and a cool doc on Bob Kane. I got this pretty cheap and even if I don't really end up enjoying the feature, the special features are well worth the purchase. I've already watched the Heart of Ice episode three times.

If story delves into different ideologies of Bruce Wayne such as his ideology towards guns, his training, and stories that are similar to monthly batman comics back in the day. The overall presentation was the most impressive part of the film, each short story has a distinct style that creates different aspects of the Dark Knight.

I am a casual anime fan so I definitely appreciate the stylistic choices made in the film. If you have ever watched the Animatrix (an anthology bAsed on the matrix saga) than you should know how this film works. It was also nice to hear Kevin Conroy as bat as as well, I couldn't really imagine any other voice actor playing the role. The DVD extras were decent, you get a very informative documentary of Bob Kane and a great featurette that analyzes Batmans most popular villains. You also get an additional 4 episodes from Batman the animated series that help inspired some of the storylines made for the film. if you are a Batman fan, check this film out, if you are a fan of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy than I suggest you buy this film to add to the collection because it is canon to some extent.

I'm sorry, but if this is a masterpeice, the 1969 Batman movie should be nominated for an Oscar.

 Alright, alright, there were some cool parts. my only two favorite scenes are: A. The Deadshot scenes where he's shooting some redeculous shot. B. After the shoot out between the cops and the GCPD, and Batman's walking through the fire. Yeah, that's awesome.

3383876,3,B001614F0S,"As plenty of people before me have said, you need to have an open mind about things.
I did...But it was still difficult to enjoy.

We're not so much getting a Batman animated movie here, but more of a collection of episodes that take place in Gotham, and center around Batman. What we're seeing is not so much Batman being Batman, but the people of Gotham noticing Batman and reacting to his actions. This is a movie of 6 episodic features, animated and directed by 6 different people telling the story of Batman making his mark as the Gotham knight.

We open up with teenagers telling their highly made up stories about their encounters with Batman in ""Have I Got a Story For You"". This was a new way to open up to a batman anything, and it was different in a good way. This basically tells the story of how the public is reacting to Batman. After this story, I was ready for the real Batman to get some screen time though, and unfortunately the next story is all about how the police force is reacting to Batman in ""Cross Fire"". This makes sense, but once again we have random characters talking about Batman that will be gone as soon as the story is over. But in this story there's less action, and even less Batman.

Next we have ""Field Test"". I disliked this the most as I'm sure many other fans did as well due to it's feeling that we weren't watching Batman. But in this story we finally get to ""meet"" Bruce Wayne. Probably the most important story to flow smoothly, get to the point, and tie all 6 stories together. It's the first time we see much of the real Batman and it's the third episode, meaning it needs to be strong in order to keep the previous and future stories from breaking apart. There was a large problem for me though...
 I didn't even know That Bruce Wayne was Bruce Wayne because he was nothing like Bruce Wayne. We've now transitioned to full blown anime style; big glossy eyes, unnatural hair, and rather than being the badass we know as Batman he's some fancy, sweet, polite guy with a ""boyish charm"" and a dainty touch. His costume was also redrawn in a way that didn't say Batman to me.
This episode had a bit more reason behind it though, as it explains the armor situation in an incredibly boring way. It was difficult to recover from this, and it took a minute before I regained my interest.

Luckily Madhouse animated ""In Darkness Dwells"" we have a quick story that now shows Batman working with the police, welcoming a solid in between of the noir cartoon we all know and love, and a cool, slight anime style. Coming back to an original Batman vibe, I'd say that the last 3 are the best.
""Working Through The Pain"" shows how much training young Bruce Wayne went through purely to be able to take a beating, and we finally get to see a realistic portrayal of Bruce Wayne (before batman). This had solid animation and a different art style that was easy to accept.

The final, ""Deadshot"" gives us full blown, old fashioned, thick lines, dark shadows, original cartoon noir art. Almost to the extent of over doing it, almost. (It's worth noting that Madhouse animated both ""In Darkness Dwells"" and ""Deadshot"".)
By the end of ""Deadshot"" Bruce is finally receiving the bat signal. Tying things up with a solid ending.

If you watch this as a movie, you will most likely be disappointed by the lack of story flow and commitment to a solid story in general. The amount things jump around will annoy you, and you will find it difficult to say the least to enjoy.

If, however, you watch this as a collection of animated shorts told in very different ways by some very different perspectives, you'll find it worth watching.",1334966400,,3651,4.471471471471472

If you take away all of the technical wizardy such as the shaky camera movements, fancy camera angles, and CGI effects an over whelming majority of these shorts do not hold up at all. As a matter of fact, only one of these shorts are worth real praise.

The one stand out, and a really good one at that, was the fifth segment entitled ""Working Through Pain"". As Batman/Bruce Wayne is suffering from a gun shot wound, he recalls the training he had gone through in order to adapt to tremendous pain. Bruce ignores what was far more important in his training, dealing with the emotional pain. At the end of the short, in a brilliant illustration, Bruce discovers the futility of attempting to be physically invincible and feels defeated in the end.

Overall, this movie definetly isn't worth the full price tag but I can't down right reject it. The visuals can be stunning at times for all six shorts but there still isn't enough here on the whole to give a passable reccomendation.",1290729600,,1300,4.773333333333333

3383892,3,B001614F0S,"I certainly admire what the filmmakers of Gotham Knights were trying to do.  This is a highly stylized interpretation of Batman, similar to something you might have seen in the early ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" comic book series, as compared to the standard fare in ""Batman"" or ""Detective"" Comics.  The artists are mostly anime, by the look of it, and there are some neat ideas flowing around and through this feature.

As a series of vignettes, people are going to disagree about what stories work and which don't.  For me, the first story is one of the strongest - about how people perceive Batman.  Here the stylized art works especially well because the kids telling the stories of what they've seen are not really sure about the details, or can't describe them well.  The jerkiness and muddiness of the animation is annoying, but it fits the story perfectly.

Unfortunately, the animation is the weakest point of several of the other stories.  Call me traditional, but Batman is a very American entity, and the cleaner/younger/wide-eyed anime style simply clashes with the content, and it does not fit as well as the dark and gritty American style of other Batman comic books and graphic novels.  The original (mid-90s) Batman: The Animated Series style was much superior, in my opinion.  (This 2-disc special edition offers viewers the chance to check this for themselves, as it includes 4 episodes from the Animated Series.)

There are many good points about this film, but it just doesn't come together for me.  Certainly it isn't as good as the bulk of the Animated Series (the Bruce Wayne-as-Batman series, not the atrocious Batman Beyond).  There are also some good DVD extras on this 2-disc set, it's certainly worth getting this disc instead of the 1-disc version.",1283990400,,1778,4.906354515050167
3383893,3,B001614F0S,"Not going to rant and fill out a big thing. I am just glad I got it on Netflix, and did not pay money for this. I will watch anything Batman, and the story is not bad. The IDEA behind different art work I thoght was going to be cool, but half the time the art work is so bad, or so Anime that you can not recognize Bruce, that it is distracting. I was excited to watch it, and was very dissapointed.",1281657600,,399,3.819277108433735
3383894,3,B001614F0S,"I don't even know where to begin with this one. This is my least favorite out of these movies, making it the black sheep of the DCU family. I'm not a particularly big fan of anime, so when I heard this was going to be done in 5 different styles, I was less than excited. This is even my least favorite Batman movie (yes Batman/movie fans, I hold ""Batman & Robin"" in much higher regard than this) and that's a difficult thing for me to say as Batman is my favorite DC hero.

The movie is actually made up of six short stories that are loosely connected and supposedly take place between ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"". The first is a rehash of ""The New Batman Adventures"" episode ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" (which is far superior to what we get here) in which Four street urchins depict Batman in a different way and each is more ridiculous than the last, the only one I think that even matches Batman is the ""living shadow"" (though Robot Batman looked cool). Then at the end when the real one shows up, his legs are smaller than his entire upper body! He should be falling over from being disproportioned. The animation in this segment is easily my least favorite and the movie wouldn't have suffered without it. The rest of the animation at least resembles each other but not by much. The second story deals with Det. Crispus Allen and Anna Ramirez arguing over if Batman is doing any good for the city only for them to wind up in a shootout between Sal Maroni and a gang of Russians. It's better than part one but the animation is annoying, especially when everybody but the cops and Batman look like zombies. I also hate that eye quivering thing or whatever that shows that people are scared. I just find it annoying. Part three is Batman testing out a bullet deflector and it's actually my favorite part of the film, showing why Batman puts his life on the line over protecting his body with a fancy gadget. The animation is great but Bruce Wayne looks a little too feminine for my taste. Part four has Batman going up against Killer Croc and Scarecrow in the sewers of Gotham. It's a pretty cool segment, building on to that Scarecrow is still on the loose from ""Batman Begins"". Part five has an injured Batman finding all these guns in the sewer while recounting his training in India. Last, part six is Batman vs. Deadshot. Yeah that's part six in a nutshell. Other than the multitude of different anime styles, my other gripe is the continuity. The stories do have a small connection but it isn't enough for me to connect point A to point B. In chapter three, we see the Nolan Batmobile. Yet in chapter 5, we see the Burton Batmobile. This is where the movie failed in my opinion. Instead of having it stand on its own, like the others DCU films do, they try and present it as the ""middle story"" set in the universe of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. But other than a few references to Begins, the connection is lost. Like the animation style, they should've picked one story and developed it from there.

Anime is great for those who love it and everything but Batman and the other superheroes shouldn't, in my opinion anyway, be done that way. I wouldn't have minded it as much if it was just done in one style, but even then, I find following the action sequences a little hard to follow. All the fast cuts and characters jumping around make it dizzying and confusing. It's also a little distracting to go from one segment where Alfred is bald to another where he has a full head of hair. Batman (especially in parts 2, 3 and 6), Scarecrow and Deadshot look great while Killer Croc doesn't even remotely resemble anything from how he's been interpreted before. He looks like a glob of fat with fangs.

But what really makes this boring movie great is the voice cast. Everyone does great (though I pity Corey Burton as Scarecrow because I can barely understand anything he's saying) but the one who saves this is none other than Kevin Conroy, the undisputed voice of Batman. Since this was released in 2008, it had been a little over two years since Batman fans had heard him do the voice so when it was announced that he was doing it again, I was very excited. He really makes those lip flaps look like their mouths are forming actual words.

If it weren't for being a fan of the Batman character, I probably would've rented it over outright buying it but fortunately, out of the eight DCU films, this is the only one I really didn't like.",1279929600,,4462,4.444444444444445
3383895,3,B001614F0S,"Gotham Knight is worth watching for its animation style and character work with Batman, but it's far from a masterpiece.  The animation of Gotham City is a real treat, but Batman goes through a costume design kaleidoscope.  Some depictions are simple, others exuberant, and some are just far too bizarre for the Dark Knight.  There's some thoroughly silly anime moments here that just shatter the Batman feel.  In Deadshot, Batman deflects a bullet meant to assassinate Lieutenant Gordon by punching it.  In case you missed that, let me repeat myself: flying through the air and punching it.  Things like this make ""willing suspense of disbelief"" a little tough.  My wife agrees with me that Gotham Knight really shot itself in the foot by using the most bizarre story and animation in their opening feature, Have I Got a Story for You.
Bruce Wayne's journey is a uniquely fascinating one, but one scene with firearms (from Working Through Pain) is Batman portrayal at its lowest.  Character development is a wonderful thing for Batman, but only if it's good.  To conclude on Gotham Knight, I think promoting itself as a companion to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight was its biggest mistake.  You can't claim to support Christopher Nolan's Batman concept and then have him animated in such a stylized fashion and punching bullets out of the air.  It's still Batman, making Gotham Knight worth watching and automatically more interesting than the other superheroes, but it's also sloppy and a real mixed bag.  And with Batman, a ""mixed bag"" doesn't cut it.",1278720000,,1556,4.9423076923076925

The story follows the POV of three kids who see Batman throughout the day, and because each one sees him differently, the animated style is different. The storyline is juxtaposed with the art styles to get progressively more intense as the story goes on. It's based on the Animated Series, and Kevin Conroy (the original voice from the Animated Series) returns to do the voice of Batman in every segment.

Personally, I love it. As an art student, I am enamored with the entire movie. Of course there are styles that appeal to me more than others in certain segments, but it's interesting to see the different interpretations of Batman, Gotham, and the villains that terrorize it. I recommend this to any fans of animation and/or Batman.",1273190400,3,946,5.569444444444445
3383897,4,B001614F0S,"Batman:Gotham Knight was worth the bargain price I aquired it for.  If you get it around $15.99 then it turns out to be a good deal.  What you get is an orginal collaboration from different directors and writers that churns up a variety of results that may impress or dissapoint you.  Fact is, there's so much to see here that it ends up being worth the time.  Some scenes are much more boring than others, but the stories are very very good.  Most of the show is anime style art with traditional Batman scenerios.  If you like the idea of Batman in an anime world, then you most likely will enjoy Batman:Gotham Knight.

What I liked:  Incarnations of villains(Scarecrow was awesome), Episode ""Working through Pain"" (Favorite), Animation for the most part, different takes on Batman's costume, Semi-continuity, & Themes throughout the stories. I also very much enjoyed the special features.  We got lots of Batman history and villain commentary.  Original series episodes were fun.

What I disliked:  It may be that I'm not a die-hard Anime fan but the Animation is boring at times.  The Ramirez character did not connect with Nolan's Ramirez in The Dark Knight, even though they tried to make that connection.  First episode was a little jarring(My least favorite episode).  It also felt like it needed more choreographed action.

So all in all, I liked it.  I can see myself buying another animated Batman.  I can also see people disliking this ""compilation"" for it's disconnection with the traditional Batman.  At least it's fresh and original, and it proves that Batman has a lot more stories to be told.",1271030400,,1608,4.845588235294118

3383899,4,B001614F0S,"OK. First, this compilation of movies is worth the money IF you completely remove the first two short movies...they are total waste of time. Bats doesn't even LOOK like himself but some blackish-blue mist (go figure) in the 1st one. The animation as well as the storyline in it is AWFUL(kids telling their version of what Bats did). In the second short, you don't even see him until the very end. But, I have to say when he FINALLY DOES make his appearance, skulls are cracked, noses are bleeding, the innocent are protected,justice is served and oh well...it's typical Bats.

Secondly,the animation in each story is markedly different. Anime is the defining thing here. 20-ish Bruce Wayne doesn't look like any Bruce Wayne I've ever seen before. But, lo and behold MR. Kevin Conroy is the voice cast as Bats throughout so all is right with the world as far as I am concerned.

The last 3 or 4 movies are violent and fast-moving. They range from his painful saw-my-parents-murdered-origins and showing how Bruce trained in another country to learn how to deal with physical pain to him going one-on-one via top of a racing subway train with a would-be assassin.

You also get 3-4 episodes from the '90's animated show. But, I was disappointed in the quality...colors were fuzzy, sounds were muffled...like they hadn't been remastered.

Is it worth the price tag? If you're a hardcore bats fan--- YES! If you're not, better stick with some of the Fox (1990's Batman; Adventures of..) and WB (2000's The Batman)on dvd.",1267920000,2,1516,4.819230769230769

3383903,3,B001614F0S,The whole story line of this I thought was good. You might want to watch it a second time though. The animation changes between 6 different artists during the movie. There were times I thought the animation of certain artists seemed very lazy. At certain points I was thinking that doesn't even look like batman it just looks like a fat guy in the suit. Nice thing about this I thought were special features (It had more special features of the 2-disc of Dark Knight). The thing I liked most about the special features is it had a few episodes of the Batman animated series from the 90's. If your around 19-23 it will bring ya back to those moments when you were little and that's always a good feeling. I just give it a 3 stars on the movie since it was short and I didn't like some of the animation (that's just an opinion though). I would rate the special features 5 stars. Definitely thought those special features were a win.,1255910400,,930,4.381502890173411
3383904,5,B001614F0S,"While Iron Man and Wolverine made some big news this summer with the trailers for their upcoming ""anime"" projects, the Caped Crusader beat them to the punch by about a year. Granted, anime-styled features like The Animatrix have come out before this, but Batman: Gotham Knight(which was the third DC Universe animated movie)acted like Dark Fury and Clone Wars which bridges the gap between two chapters of a franchise. It's supposed to happen after Batman Begins, and just before The Dark Knight, although it doesn't 100% fit into the given continuity of both films.

This movie is broken up into six segments, each one directed by an actual Japanese anime director. The first one shows some kids each telling their own version of running into Batman. Second has two Gotham City cops running into a gang war. Next is a very bishounen-looking Bruce Wayne donning a costume strait out of Gatchaman to test his own personal forcefield. Following that is a slight 2-parter of sorts where Batman heads into the sewers to take on Scarecrow and their own version of Killer Croc, which later has Bruce Wayne flashing back to when he was travelling the world and training. In the finale, Batman clashes with the sniper-for-hire, Deadshot.

Gotham Knight has some great comics writing from Brian Azzrello, Greg Rucka, and Bruce Timm. Some of the anime studios behind it were Production I.G.(Ghost In The Shell) and Madhouse(Vampire Hunter D). There is some very fine animation in this movie, and mostly worth getting for that alone. It's also bound to satisfy the average Bat-fan. The only real drawbacks to it are like the other DC Universe movies is that it was too short. I felt they could've added some more to each of the chapters, or at least maybe left out some of the chapters while making the others longer. It gives a good insight into the way the citizens of Gotham each view having a masked vigilante in their town, while at the same time showing how it is for Bruce Wayne to be Batman. It isn't necassary to see this in order to enjoy either of the Christopher Nolan movies, but you'd still have a thrillride at Bat-Time!",1253923200,,2124,4.753387533875339
3383905,4,B001614F0S,"Executive directors Toshi Himura and Bruce Timm collaborated to put together six short animated pieces on The Batman.  I was impressed with most (not all) of the animation and it was quite original.

Tying together the events between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, we explore first off what others consider the Batman is.  Is he a moving night shadow?  Something like The Man-Bat?  An invincible hero?

As the stories progress you see him as a dark, brooding man who is searching for answers and at best is groping for his basic purpose, something the writers give him in spades.

I don't want to write up all the credits and all the voice actors so as to keep this write-up short, but they all did a great job, many of them DC Comics writers.

Briefly:

""Have I Got a Story for You"" involves some teenager skateboard fiends who elaborate a bit on their adventures with The Batman.  Kinda cartoony for my taste.

""Cross-fire"" has the fictional character Crispus Allen, whom geeks will recall was the Spectre in the more recent comic books.  A police detective who does not trust that ""vigilante"" until he sees what The Bat can do.  The fire scene is particularly striking.

""Field Test"" checks out a new personal force shield, that is worn by the Bat with unpredictable results.

""In Darkness Dwells"" and ""Working Through Pain"" one could say are all one story, really.  Killer Croc attacks, under the spell of The Scarecrow's venomous gas that drives people nuts (as seen in Batman Begins).  Batman, bleeding to death in a gutter/sewer, recalls Cassandra, a woman who tries to help him find himself and ease his pain.  Did she succeed?

Finally, ""Deadshot"" and what a bad guy he is!  He is with a gun what Batman is without one.  They're so opposite and so alike, it's great.  The story and the action are non-stop and keeps you hanging.

In many ways Batman: Gotham Knight, though uneven at times, will delight the most discerning DC Comics fan or anyone who appreciates the Japanese and American animated art forms.

Features on the DVD include the ""sneak peek"" of the Wonder Woman DVD (which I liked a lot -- Amazons kicking butt), a trailer for The Dark Knight and an ad for the latest remastered Popeye cartoons.

You may have not liked the movie, but by far and away it was not a one star or even a two star. I think the most interesting part of this newly animated rendition of Batman is that you get to see 4 or 5 different perspectives on what Batman and Gotham look like. Its interesting and fun to see Batman animated in such distinct and creative ways. Story aside, I think most people who gave this movie horrible ratings are doing so because, for lack of a better word, they are fanboys- and the truth about fanboys and fangirls is that they have expectations in story and presentation that keep them from appreciating a little creativity. You may or may not enjoy every short story in this compilation, but I can guarantee that you will enjoy at least one and you should appreciate them all. My favorite piece was the ""Working Through the Pain"" segment. The writers really went into an introspective side of Batman that normal animated Batman just doesn't do. I have every animated Batman piece created and I can tell you that I love them all. This may not be the best one- though some may argue that it is, it is the most creative.

it is an Excellent DVD!

as with the Animatrix it is a collection of storys rather than one complet movie. however all storys are linked up with each other.

i should warn you that this may not be suitible for some children, parents be aware.

keven conroy returnes as Batman. hes the best actor for the cartoon voice of batman!

i should add this animated story is NOT in the same 'universe' as the Batman animated seres, Batman Beyond, or JL.

but it does indeed use elements from batman begins and Dark knight.

""Have I got a stoy for you""
i felt this was the weakest story of the lot. basicly its how differant kids veiw batman, which has been done before.

""Crossfire""
this was a much better story, and I fealt it should have been the introduciton to this DVD. two cops take a prisoner to arkham and get into the crossfire of mob warfare. Batman has an excellent entrance! hes walking through a burning car and he just stands there!

(I should point out that the female cop is NOT montya. shes the same detective as in Dark knight. oddly the book version of this DVd calls her montya. but she isnt!)

""Feild Test""
a light story, but decent. Batman tests out a device with terrible consiquences.

""In Darkness Dwells""
this is one of my two favorite stories for this DVD.
batman goes underground to find the scarecrow and meets killer croc.
the art for this story was excellent.

""Working through the Pain""
continuing from the last story, batman is still in the sewers. hes recalling his training in India.

""Deadshot""
my second favorite story.
batman faces the gunman Deadshot.
more great animation.

however i fealt the ending was a bit weak or at least to open.
kinda left me wanting to know what happens next.
it didn't feel like it lead into Dark knight enough

however..
all in all it was a great DVD.
because its direct to DVD
it can be far darker than previous and current batman cartoons.

it was a great collection.
id love to see more like it.

the 2 disc verson offers episodes from Batman animated series.
with some great episodes.
""Legends"" (which is slightly similer to ""have i got a story for you' however its more of a tribute story) this story pays homage to batman storys from the 50s and 60s and also to Frank miller's Dark Knight. with a quick verbal refrance to Batman forever.
""Heart of Ice"" probly the most famous episode which reinvented Mr Freeze and made him a more interesting charture.
""I am the Night"" Gordon is shot and is being hunted down by a killer a very realistic story.
""over the Edge"" a differant story. i won't spoil it if u haven't seen it.

i very much enjoyed the documentarys.
""Batman and Me' which talks about Bob Kane.
""Villains' which overviews the various batman villains.

This is not Batman; this is more like bad Japanese anime (and like all Japanese animated attempts, it lacks style, creativity, originality, and uniqueness).

3383915,3,B001614F0S,"The positives of the DVD:  1) Blu-ray technology gives the animation the enhanced visual detail necessary for maximum enjoyment. 2) Seeing ""Over the Edge"" and ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" was a welcomed blast from the past.  3) The Deadbolt story was the best of the six.

The negatives of the DVD:  1) It automatically takes you to the six stories once the DVD is loaded into the Blu-ray player.  There is no option to view specific stories out of sequence.  2) Afterwards, you have to fast forward through the numerous versions of the FBI Warning translated in at least ten languages.  3) If you are familiar with Batman lore or know it as well as Bob Kane and Bill Finger, the remaining bonus features and commentaries (Wonder Woman DVD trailer excluded) are not worth seeing.

While I will always be a fan of Batman, I can only recommend this to the die-hard fans.  For people that want to see Batman animated; but do not know which DVDs to buy, I would suggest first seeing Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm.  Then I would see Batman:  Mystery of the Batwoman.

It's a sham because you buy it to watch something on Batman but you're fooled into watching six over-stylized Japamation versions of an American icon, AND that being said, this DVD makes a mockery of the Dark Knight.
-  Since when and in who's mind is Batman a neutured metrosexual, a monster, or a referee between mobsters. This dvd is all that is wrong with the animee style of animation. Feminine men who even look like women, unbelievable over-exaggerated action scenes, and annoying dialog. Dont get me wrong... I do like some animee (Akira, Ghost in a Shell, Appleseed, Princess Monokee) but not this type ala television animee.
-  Unless you think that Batman Beyond is the best version of Batman out there this DVD is not for you. Speaking of Batman beyond, that sucks too! What ever happened to Batman: the animated series... I miss that.",1230336000,3,1010,4.76
3383924,3,B001614F0S,"When I read in one of my magazines that they were making Batman Gotham Knight, I was really excited about it.  I thought it would be this dark adult animated movie that I would find really gripping and entertaining. I saw it in blockbuster one day when I was with one of my friends so I decided to buy it. Maybe my expectations were too high but I was slightly disappointed.
It isn't one long movie. It's a movie in six sections and it is done by different anime artists. Some of the styles I liked, some disliked. I guess that is just a preference of opinion. But some of the separate stories I found a little  bit predictable. The first one is okay. It didn't really do anything for me and I didn't particularly love the style. In some of the other stories, certain aspects seemed somewhat awkward and batman just suddenly appears in a very odd places. I don't want to give too much away but there was one side story that was a bit interesting. It went back into his past when he was still training to become batman. I really loved the style of the last section of the story but I thought there would be more to the bad guy.
I'm not saying it's bad but some of it wasn't outstanding. There is some great directing and animation in it, don't get me wrong but perhaps my expectations were too high. I would rent it first before you buy it to see it is something you really want.",1227571200,4,1378,4.23574144486692

With the exception of the first episode, which is, also the most  ""diferent"" of the conceptions of Batman, the all others are great job... so great that at the end of each chapter, they keep you waiting for more... which is a little frustrating, because there is no more.

I didn't mind that it was in anime as I am a fan of that style of animation but the first story definitely sucked! The stories progressively got better as the feature went on with the final story called ""Deadshot"" being the best of the bunch!

3383938,4,B001614F0S,"I caught Batman Gotham Knight on Cartoon Network and I was very impressed. Similar to the Animatrix in format, it gives a sample of some of today's top animators' vision of the Dark Knight. More importantly, it echoes the sincerity, psychology and grit of the Nolan films, and that's where the character really shines. Made for promotion of last summer's The Dark Knight, Batman Gotham Knight follows the continuity of Batman Begins, including characters Scarecrow and Jim Gordon (plus a really cool, though brief take on Killer Croc). The return of Kevin Conroy voicing Batman/Bruce Wayne is really the icing on the cake.

The saddest thing about the history of Batman is the seemingly unavoidable marketing campiness that pops up every few years. This set of anime shorts really show what animated Batman should be - a mature, deep psychological analysis of what is essentially a psychopath redeemed only by his unfailing sense of justice. If only Warner would greenlight a serious Batman anime series like this!

The first chapter is a rehash of an old Animated Series episode called ""Legends of the Dark Knight."" It's worth skipping, but the rest are outstanding. ""In Darkness Dwells"" and ""Working Through Pain"" are worth owning this set alone.

Initially I had passed on Batman Gotham Knight when it was released, due to its similarity to the Animatrix. But after watching it last weekend, I have to have this DVD set to add to my collection.",1223251200,,1447,4.946502057613169

HAVE I GOT A STORY FOR YOU 2 Stars out of five **
The weakest of the whole segments, a very strange kind of animation, looks like the Adam west's batman, a little overweight and one thing that bugs me the most is that batman seems to have great difficulty beating one clumsy weak villain during the whole segment

CROSSFIRE 3 and a half Stars out of Five *** 
Nice visual style, Batman looks more menacing and bulky than ever, great action sequences

FIELD TEST  3 stars out of five ***
Batman looks like the Phantom of the Paradise in this segment, not much to tell about this segment, Lucius gives to batman a  new device that can disperse bullets, but batman soon realize the risks of the collateral damage of this new device

IN DARKNESS DWELLS 5 Stars out of five ****
The best segment of all, Batman looks menacing, it shows great detective skills, a fierce attitude, the city looks like blade runner, the sewers are terrific, the story is strong, the action blows your mind, the scarecrow and the killer crook are menacing than ever. And yes Batman looks like the one from the Tim Burton's Movies

WORKING THROUGH PAIN ***
Batman crawling and suffering in deep pain for the whole segment, while he has back flashes about his experiences in India when he was learning how to deal with pain, not my favorite one tough many people like it

DEADSHOT 4 and a Half stars out of five ****1/2
One of the best segments of the bunch, Batman fighting against a merciless sniper, the animation of this segment compete with the ""In Darkness dwell"" segment, a very frantic confrontation between batman and dead shot.",1223251200,2,1647,4.559322033898305
3383940,2,B001614F0S,"About the only thing that can be said in favor of this film is that the animation is often striking and beautiful. Otherwise, it suffers from all the defects of the animated series after Warner Bros. decided to turn it into a marketing gimic.

The animated series as developed by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and others was great, but once Warner Bros. realized they had a success they had to milk it for all the money they could: rework it for a younger audience, make it lighter, less dark and less intelligent.

Gotham Knight is dark, but for the most part only in the visual sense. The story line is almost indecipherable -- pointless twists and turns, jumps -- a mess.

The characters are superficial as is the annoying philosophizing.

Someone like Alan Moore can pull this off. But Warner Bros. can destroy his work and they destroy whatever might have been good in Gotham Knight.",1223078400,,880,4.621794871794871
3383941,1,B001614F0S,"WoW.. this series of 6 short, and i mean short cartoons blows..
1 ""Have I Got A Story For You""- The animation is equal to the crap you find on cartoon network as of late ""Dexter's laboratory"" ""ed edd and eddie"".. that kinda crap. The cgi used for the backgrounds were well done and the sound track was alright. But when I buy an animation I like to enjoy the quality of the artwork. The story line was dumb I thought
2 ""Crossfire""- The animation was much much better but the color of the short was so dark it was hard to see the picture even after adjusting the contrast color brightness etc. It gave me the feel from the spawn series from HBO. Good story line but again crappy art. Now do not misunderstand me I know Batman is a ""dark"" character who creeps in the night. I'm not a major fan but even if it takes place at nite and in shadows the viewer should still be able to see what is happening. There is a big difference between crappy art and being dark art.
3 Field Test"" Was probably the best short. With animation similar to the japanimation in my collection I could now focus on the story fully. Again nice backgrounds and an interesting story.
4 ""In Darkness Dwells"" Was a mildly entertaining short. Again great city scenes and backgrounds. But poor character animation AND it was dark in some parts. Shadows on a persons face shouldn't be giant triangles of pure black.
5 ""Working through the Pain""- Had good art work but I found the story line to be less interesting then the others. It was more of a lame flash back character development short.
6 ""Deadshot""- This story was among the best on this collection as well. Clean animation with great city scenes and an interesting story to follow.

I think that the last episode was likely the best of the bunch, but it's a real shame I sat through all the other ones to get there. The snippets are interesting enough, but the presentation is a little discombobulated and readjusting to the changes in animation gets a little annoying after a while.

3383946,1,B001614F0S,"Being a pretty big batman fan is what led me to purchase this DVD.  A few of the shorts showed promise, but were ultimately doomed to extinction.  The different renderings of batman showed talent, but I like the main character to look the same at least for some duration.  The same goes for the plots.  Although they were loosely tied together (very loosely), the continuity was lost throughout the shorts.  I think they should have picked one of these six designs and developed a substantial plot that batman fans could enjoy.  Completely absent was the detective-like appeal that batmans fans have come to expect.

So, if you're a hardcore batman fan, you may want to pick this up but don't expect much except a sketchbook rendition of a hero who deserves much more.  Otherwise, don't bother - it's just not worth the utter disappointment.

3383947,2,B001614F0S,"The stories in this DVD are very weak. It seems like the producers etc. concentrated their creativity on style rather than actually storyline, plot etc.

The animation is kind of cool and interesting (although I liked the MTV Spiderman a little bit better) but the stories were short and lacked any substance. Also, with each episode only being 12 minutes there wasn't a lot of time to develop a story. Yes, each episode kind of builds on each other. However, overall I think this DVD was rushed a little bit to come out at the same time as the movie.

Speaking of the Dark Night.... I've read tons of stuff on how that movie probably should have been rated R if that's the case then this DVD should be rated NC-17. I think the PG13 rating was way too kind. With the gory showing of decapitations, people being blown away and blood being splattered all over the place it was just sickening. The producers of this DVD would have been better spent concentrating on their story and plot development instead of of worrying how can I annimate this guy getting his head blown off.

It is also a declaration that this older crowd also expects more than the typical Saturday morning stuff they see when they walk by the kids in the living room after breakfast. This telling of Batman was split into 6 parts, telling in many way how The Batman came to gain som eof the discipline to be the Dark Night he is now and showed us a few villians that we don't usually see. This is NOT a movie for the kids, this is and may not be the Batman that everyone rememebrs but, for me, the important thing to rememeber is the look, the feel, the textures, the richness of the animation. It is such a welcome treat to see the Japanese Anime' twist all over this movie. It cleary stands alone as far as the Batman animated movies thus far.",1219536000,,909,4.2298850574712645

Overall I liked Batman Gotham Knight it is defiantly worth renting and watching.

I like the no holds bar approach of the Japanese not being afraid to show bad guys getting whacked but Batman should never be seen killing anyone directly. The ridiculous blood splatter and flashing fight scenes need to be toned down because this is still a deeply rooted America hero, what I am saying is do not completely erase that American feel.

Over all I like the anime idea; still some episodes were a waste of time some were awesome, all anime in its violence and conceited character images not much of an American feel other than the great Kevin Conroy.",1219017600,,824,4.486666666666666

The idea is exciting, but DC should have stuck with one anime director and artistic style to keep a cohesive flow to the film.  The writing is actually pretty good and the character development for Bruce Wayne & Detectives Ramirez/Allen is acceptable, but it just feels unsettling to watch it in varying episodes.

Also, Kevin Conroy does a good job not just using his Batman:TAS voice, but I still feel they should have gone with a younger actor to give this project its own continuity.

I wasn't even going to buy it, but Target offered it with Batman Beyond: The Movie added on to the disc, which made it worth the price.

First the good:
* The DVD's do serve as a good bridge between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.
* Kevin Conroy does his usual excellent job as Batman's voice.
* The voice talent in general does an excellent job.
* The backgrounds and equipment designs are beautifully done.

Now the bad: The characters are illustrated so poorly that it looks like the majority of the art budget was blown on the backgrounds. The teenagers in the first episode, for example, look like they were drawn by an artist using a half-melted ice sculpture as his reference. The quality of the character animation and illustration does NOT improve as the series progresses.

Though not as poorly drawn as The Batman TV series, the apparent lack of effort put into illustrating the characters destroys all my enjoyment for this DVD series. It's too bad, because the voice talent, background illustrations, and storylines are all excellent.",1218412800,,959,4.907407407407407

It's actually worth watching through once or twice to get an idea of the expanding universe of the Batman series.  However, this planned trilogy really stands on its own as it has no relation to the graphic novels of latter years.  No parrallel universes nor joker in sight, but the gritty reality and dark themes that it sets to deliver flow well.  This is a good transition between the first movie and into the second one.

However, some of the animations, were not my cup of tea.  I think I'm being nitpicky about just one of them.  (I'm afraid you will know it when you see it) However, it doesn't remove from the actual presentation as it a side story of sorts and has no really backstory to aid.

Now Batman has returned in a tale that shows how he transformed from novice crime fighter and into the Dark Knight, and the action and animation are excellent here! I found this 6 part film to be really dark for what I remember of Batman. Personally I feel as if it pays good homage to the dark knight as I remember but with a darker more sinister look into him and seeing crime as it really is.

I wasn't let down and I enjoyed every minute of it, especially the speculation from the youths in the beginning of the story. the only thing I would have wanted was a real plot. Since it's reminiscent of most cartoon series in how it tells a short story in each, it didn't exactly follow a major plot throughout them all aside from a mission to mission sorta thing.

This DVD, unfortunately, disappointed me tremendously and (frankly) rides the wave of popularity with little substance in and amongst itself.  It plays on the Scarecrow a touch, and attempts to address Mr. Fox's involvement a bit more...an effort to fill some gaps between 'Begins' and 'Dark Knight.'  It just doesn't fill enough of the gaps, and certainly leaves a GAPING hole in any of the background of the Joker or Harvey Dent.  Also...the six different directorial styles are different enough (particularly the first chapter), that although the stories seem to have continuity...all of it adds up to a whole bunch of nothing.

Gotham Knight tries to do the same thing for Batman, but doesn't quite succeed. Its a lot shorter than the Animatrix was, and much less solid throughout. The movie starts out pretty weak with a lame reinterpretation of the ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" episode of the classic '90s animated series, in which some kids compare their exaggerated tales of what Batman is like. The next few episodes were okay, but the whole thing felt pretty lifeless until the last two episodes. The first of which, ""Working Through Pain"", was very interesting and had a sorrowful note to it. The final episode, ""Deadshot"", was the best by far. It's telling that the animation in this episode looks the most like an American comic book. Let's face it: not everything was meant to be anime. The fact that four episodes of Batman: The Animated Series were included on the second disc makes this all the more obvious.

""Field Test"" has Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne working on the latest invention for Batman as he fights against a gang of criminals on a boat near Gotham Harbor, ""In Darkness Dwells"" has our hero pitting himself against Killer Croc and The Scarecrows in the sewers. ""Working Through Pain"" has Batman wounded as he remembers his past in Asia where he is trained on how to live with pain from a East Indian woman and finally ""Deadshot"" has a top assassin who is willing to kill for a prophet until the Dark Knight stops him.

A wonderful American/Japanese animated anthology that fills in some of the gaps of the ending to ""Batman Begins"" and starts way before ""The Dark Knight"" in Nolan's universe. The film has six directors from Japan and the stories are written by David Goyer (""Batman Begins"", ""Blade 2""), Josh Olson (""A History of Violence"") and Alan Burnett (""Batman The Animated Series"") with Bruce Timm as one of the executive producers with animation from Warner, Madhouse and Production IG. This is a violent, gritty and stylish animated collection of stories in the tradition of ""Robot Carnival"" and ""Heavy Metal"" that isn't really for kids due to animated bloody images and violence but more for teens and up. Kevin Conroy voices Batman as always and this movie is no exception proving he is the best voice for him, the animation in these segments are truly outstanding all the way and so is the voice acting.

Averaging at about 11 minutes each the stories are just too short to really make an impression and a couple of them end abruptly much to the annoyance of the viewer.

Kevin Conroy returns as the voice of Batman (this will come as a great relief to fans who have had to put up with Rino Romano's voice in the new, inferior series) but there's none of the wild invention seen in the 90s TV series or any of the subsequent feature-length movies. Each story seems to have one idea and sticks with it to the bitter end whether it works or not. It would have been better if they connected the stories and built towards a better end.

As a movie it fails. As a sequence of quick adventures leading up to The Dark Knight it kinda works. The animation is pretty and I'd like to see more but give us more depth next time, Warner.

The Blu Ray features a 1.85:1 1080p picture that isn't amazing but still manages to impress depending on the animation style of the particular adventure. The first being the worst and the last being the best. There is also a DD+ soundtrack which works just fine and quite a lot of extras.

3383996,4,B001614F0S,"I liked this a lot.  You get six short animated Batman films, each with a different visual style and each examining a different aspect of the character.  There's a nice bit of editorial cohesion between the chapters, too, as a small plot point in one story will show up in a bigger way in another story, that sort of thing.  As other reviewers have pointed out, however, contrary to some descriptions this is not a kind of ""bridging"" DVD that connects Christopher Nolan's first Batman film with his second; this is just a nice little side project that tells a few extra Batman stories using the more serious, complex flavor of the Nolan films.  The animation ranges from pleasantly stylish (the initial story with the skateboarding kids) to sit-up-and-take-notice breathtaking (the concluding ""Deadshot"" chapter), with nothing sloppy or sub-par in sight.

I bought the single-disc edition of ""Batman: Gotham Knight"", which has a few modest special features, but nothing like past single-disc versions of recent direct-to-DVD DC animated films.  I guess I'll have to buy those two-disc versions in the future to get at least one decent documentary to watch after the movie.

I got this DVD because of all the great reviews from those purporting to be Batman fans, expecting a great feature with excellent animation and a compelling storyline.

Like many others, I've followed Batman since I was a kid and own a large collection of Batman comics and graphic novels; these include the favorites such as the Long Halloween, Dark Victory, Batman: Year One, the Dark Knight Returns, and Knightfall.  With that said, from the perspective of one who has followed Batman and is familiar with the character's evolution over the past 10 years, this feature was mediocre and disappointing.

On the positive side, the animation and sound (including voice acting) was superb.  However, in my opinion the lack of any compelling plotline or character insight/development will always overshadow good video or audio.  Furthermore, for those looking for some connection between the two movies by Chris Nolan, you won't find any of significance.  With that said, don't expect a DC version of the Animatrix, which was designed to give die-hard fans a deeper level of understanding and appreciation for the series.",1217203200,8,1248,5.058536585365854
3383999,2,B001614F0S,"This DVD is a bummer if you were hoping the animated version would be more kid-friendly than The Dark Knight movie. Sadly, this DVD is not appropriate for little Batman-fans.

Surprisingly, the DVD isn't that great for adults either. I'll preface by saying I liked The Dark Knight movie, despite the fact that it was the darkest detective story I'd seen since ""Seven.""

The mishmash of stories and directors in the DVD Batman Gotham Knight failed to engage me because there's no coherent transition from one short story to another. In fact, it never became clear how these stories bridge the two Batman movies (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight). The marketing campaign for this DVD claimed that it would fill in the gaps between the two movies.

Anime fans will like to see Batman illustrated in new and interesting ways. And trust me some of the art is very, very good. However, there's just not enough story here to engage most adults. None of the short stories lived up to the episosde ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" from Batman Gotham Knights (a.k.a. The New Batman Adventures) produced in 1998.

3384000,2,B001614F0S,This is probably the poorest animated adaptation of Batman ever. The shorts are well...to short. They never really go anywhere and they definitely don't fit in with Nolan's Dark Knight. This just seems like a pure marketing scheme by WB and DC. Make a new Batman DVD just as TDK comes out for all the suckers to buy(or rent). The only redeeming value of this disk are the original Batman Animated episodes. They are much richer and have better animation in my opinion. I admittedly don't like anime style but even with good animation this would still stink.,1217116800,5,557,4.6938775510204085

If you feel the story is weak..then get off your butt and go write one yourself..if not..then don't cry about it. That's my opinion.

3384002,4,B001614F0S,"It is almost pointless to mention other reviews on this site harping the language and violence on the DVD rather trying to give an in-depth review. Please go back to your sewing circles or try to inform potential buyers on the validity of the product, not if your child can grasp the material or understand adult material (what a pointless exercise.) Compared to most things on TV, this DVD is tame.

On to the DVD: people are trying to compare Gotham Knight to the new movie without merit. Like the Animatrix series before, this animated series only adds to the wealth of movie and video and material on the character. Also like the Animatrix, it follows suit by having American scripts collaborate with Japanese animators and techniques, no doubt to cash in on wider markets. I will admit the stories are not as well written compared to the Animatrix. Some of the shorts are either slow-moving, or when an exciting short starts to get going, it ends too abruptly. A wiser  move by the creators would have been to try and create a more seamless story that connected all the stories much like the Clone Wars series did or cut a few of he 7 stories and broaden the remaining ones.

If you are a fan of Batman and the whole mythology around it you will enjoy the DVD--if you are just a fan of the comics or the movies you might not enjoy some parts. It helps to watch the new Christopher Nolan movie to appreciate the sum of the parts but it is not necessary. In other words, judge for yourself because these shorts are worth at least a rent.

The real gem of this collection is Disc 2, in particular the documentaries on the rogues gallery of Batman and a brief history of Bob Kane. Some real interesting people are interviewed, such as Mark Hamil and Stan Lee, to eulogize on Kane and his quirks. It is interesting to note that Batman was crafted after Da Vinci's flying model and that Kane basked in the spotlight as his character's creator, mentioning, ""The creator of Batman"" often when introducing himself. A concise history of villains establishes the fact a great hero is only defined by his villains, and each is an alter-ego of the main hero. Along with a revealing Wonder Woman animated clip, Disc 2 is worth the few extra dollars.",1217116800,,2240,4.537128712871287
3384003,4,B001614F0S,"Batman: Gotham Knight (DVD)-
Being dubbed ""The Animatrix"" of the Batman movies, this compilation couldn't have a better comparison. Just as The Animatrix fit in-between the first and second Matrix movies, this one fits between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. There are six stories by six separate anime creators. And again, just as The Animatrix, some stand out more than others. Oh, and Kevin Conroy of Batman: The Animated Series, Justice League, and, well, basically every time you've heard Batman in an animated show in the last 15 years (except for Justice League: New Frontier), Kevin Conroy is who you've heard.

1) ""Have I Got a Story for You"" - This first one probably has the most awkward look out of all of them but it seems to fit with the style of story being told. I've read comparisons with this story to one called ""Tales of the Dark Knight"" which was part of the Adventures of Batman and Robin series. Personally, I don't remember that episode but instead it reminded me of an early Batman: The Animated Series episode called "" P.O.V."" where three of Batman's villains tell a story about Batman from their own point of view. In this story it's some kids who do the storytelling and each telling gives us a freakish view of what they think Batman really is. It's got some interesting designs for Batman as we go from retelling to retelling but I thought overall it was just ok.

2) ""Crossfire"" - This was one of my favorite ones mainly because of the style. It was more realistic and I loved the set up for this one. We see Lt. Gordon helping Batman deal with some of the remaining crime bosses. A pair of Gotham detectives literally get caught in the crossfire of a shoot-out between two crime factions. One of the selling points for me in this one is a beautiful shot of Batman overlooking Gotham which seems to be inspired by a Jim Lee drawing he did during his Batman run a couple of years ago. The fight between Batman and the two factions is also a lot of fun to watch.

3) ""Field Test"" - The style for this one is ""softer"" than the others. The design for Bruce Wayne especially seems very effeminate and it's the first time Kevin Conroy's voice doesn't seem to match the character design. And they take some major liberties with Batman's costume in this one giving the cowl an almost bird-like beak. The plot, though, is interesting as we see Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman's character from the movies) develop a new technology that will make Batman ""bulletproof"". When a thug accidentally gets wounded because of the new technology, Batman makes an interesting choice concerning this technology that could make his crime-fighting abilities almost superhuman.

4) ""In Darkness Dwells"" - This is another one that has a style that is very warped but they seem to play it off a bit on the fact that Scarecrow is in this segment and he's dealing out his fear toxin again. We get an appearance from Killer Croc in this one and I like the origin they give him. The style makes this one very creepy looking and we get a good story featuring two of Batman's best rogues.

5) ""Working Through Pain"" - The animation in this one has it's own style but leans more towards the realistic like ""Crossfire"" did. We get to see how Bruce Wayne learned how to deal with pain. It is an very brutal journey that shows us why fighting those guys in the prison camp at the beginning of Batman Begins was no big deal compared to what he dealt with in this story.

6) ""Deadshot"" - The title of this one, in all it's simplicity, tells us all we need to know. It's immediately evident why they saved this one for last. Yes, I'm going to say it, this DVD ends with a bang! Ok, I got it out of my system. But there's no other way to describe it. This is from Madhouse studios whose style is very similar to Ninja Scroll (I couldn't determine if they had actually worked on Ninja Scroll or not). I've never known much about the villain Deadshot but they sure make him out to be a major threat here. He and Batman have some very intense battles and it almost leaves you wishing that all 6 six stories where done by these guys. I mean, no offense to the other creators but this last one was just awesome!

I don't know how much this will actually enhance your viewing of The Dark Knight but regardless you should check this out for some great anime that also feature everyone's favorite Dark Knight detective.",1217030400,,4399,4.49125

1) The artwork is awful. Yes, I get that its supposed to be Manga-like. In the end its complete crap. I mean, its like a room of 6-year olds got together to draw Batman and somebody said, ""Hey lets use THAT"". Shadows are over done, angles all wrong, proportions goofed. Its like Salvador Dali suddenly got a job as a comic book artist.

2) Animation is choppy, the framerate seemed very low. I mean, I actually checked my DVD player thinking it was broken. Nope, the DVD is just choppy, 4 frames per sec, like watching a flip book on crack.

3) Bruce Wayne is neither Mr. Spock nor some doe-eyed reject from the Robotech series. Sheesh, worst rendition ever.

4) Disjointed plot. Yeah, I get it, 6 stories all linked. Cooool. NOT. It was like someone held a high school plot writing contest and the kids used all the same campy themes you'd expect from a bunch of hacks. Some cops hate Batman, some like him. Batman is human, lets see him work thru pain, Batman, he's on a mission. Wow, this is DEEP STUFF. Riiiight.

Had I not paid for this I would have turned it off. I was RELIEVED when it was over. This isn't just bad, its truly terrible. It pains me to say this because I really love animation (Justice League, Superman, and some of the Marvel works as well). I'm sure there are some freaky fanboys out there hopped up on the Scarecrow's joy juice who will ""love the gritty nature of the 'gotham knight'"". Personally you'd find more entertainment, folding your $13 dollars into a facsimile of Batman and running around the room with it. It is THAT BAD.",1216944000,15,1770,4.384146341463414

The result was less than stellar. Stories are too short and the first handful move slowly, it barely features Batman (from his point of view at least) enough, it is a Batman film afterall, the look of Batman in some of the designs is pretty blah.

3384008,5,B001614F0S,"I have now watched the DVD movie GOTHAM KNIGHTS twice and I have to say that not only does it bear watching more than once, I think it needs more than one viewing to really appreciate all that it holds.  The 6 chapters DO hold together much better than some of the reviewers have said and yet each episode or chapter also can stand by itself.  It also builds a bridge from the film BATMAN BEGINS to the new one, THE DARK KNIGHT, but again, it is a subtle bridge and can be enjoyed all on its own.  It also builds a bridge of sorts between the comic book Batman and the film version.

The animation is breathtaking in parts and works well throughout to tell the story (stories).

It is very interesting and a great device to have the great Kevin Conroy voicing Batman (and of course, Bruce Wayne) throught all 6 chapters. It brings continuity since the animation style changes from episode to episode. And all the voice acting throughout was wondeful. It was cool having David McCallum (of MAN FROM UNCLE fame), playing Alfred the Butler, and he did a superb job.  And it is always nice to hear actors like Corey Burton and George Newburn, regulars in DCU animation doing various characters throughout.

 I liked all 6 chapters, but my favorite was ""Working Through Pain"".  This one had a lot of resonance for me beyond the story.  For lack of a better way of saying it, it was the most ""spiritual"" of the stories (and not only because of the setting in India!)

I highly recommend this for true Batman fans (and IMHO, those the ones who are flexible and understand how flexible and diverse the character can be).

3384011,2,B001614F0S,"I'd seen this DVD advertised lately, coinciding the period that the movie ""The Dark Knight"" hit theaters (which I have already seen, and is an amazing film).
Being a fan of Batman, I was excited to rent this. The advertisements stated some of the writers of ""The Dark Knight"" were involved in this, and upon looking the cast over at my local Blockbuster, my excitement grew when I saw that Bruce Timm (one of the Executive Producers of the Batman: The Animated Series cartoon) was involved, and Batman himself was being voiced by Kevin Conroy (the voice of Batman in said series).
Now, I have a lot of respect for Batman: The Animated Series. It was often done really well, even for a 30 minute cartoon. It could be a little grown up, but without being too harsh for kids to watch. And personally, Kevin Conroy voicing Bruce Wayne/Batman is one of my favorite incarnations of the character, along with Christian Bale as the current big screen Batman. I'll even go as far as to say the writers of said series should have been the ones to write the 90's era Batman movies.
And now we come to Batman: Gotham Knight. This DVD was a big letdown. It indeed is six Batman stories. ""Interlocking"" is not a word I'd use to describe them though (as the ads promoted ""Six interlocking stories""). More like, casually related to. If at all. For instance, one story involves Batman fighting off some gangs, one of which is a Russian gang. In another, Batman stops a gang fight (one of the gangs being Russian), and establishes for them which one stays on what turf, since he doesn't have the evidence to put away either of them yet. That's about as far as the stories are related.
They're short (about 12 to 15 my guess), and thus there isn't much time to cover a lot of ground. Some stories might have been worthwhile if they had been given enough time develop, and had more story to add.
Bruce Timm and Alan Burnett (also from the Animated Series) may have been involved, but this is certainly not their best work.
And while I really like Kevin Conroy as Batman in said series, his voice doesn't fit in here. Basically, Bruce Wayne is supposed to be younger here, and the animation reflects that. Conroy's voice simply doesn't sound right coming from this cartoon. It just doesn't fit. He's a lot better as a middle aged or older Batman.
Another thing to note: it appears that this was meant to be a series of in between stories after Batman Begins, but before The Dark Knight. Hmmm....
Just like different writers were given the task of writing the episodes, it appears that different animators were given the task of animating them. The art varies, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's just plain awful (I'm thinking specifically of the first story, where characters are drawn somewhat plumpy looking, with slender limbs).
Well, what else can I say? This just doesn't have a very well done feel to it. More like Warner Brothers said ""Hey, we've got this new Batman movie hitting theaters in the summer, make us a bunch of crappy cartoons so we can sell them direct to video and make some more money"".
Maybe ""crappy"" is a bit of a strong word. But that's my opinion. A couple of these stories, if fleshed out better and given more time, could have been decent (maybe even great?), but it all falls flat.
I would have preferred that they instead come out with another direct to DVD movie based on the Animated Series, and given us one whole movie, with Bruce Timm and co. making it, and given some free reign over it. Or maybe even a stand alone story set in it's own continuity. Or even the Batman Begins continuity. But these shorts just don't cut it. I'm sorry.
Personally, I'm glad I rented this and didn't all out buy it. I simply cannot recommend this one, not to casual or hardcore fans, unless you are completely obsessed with Batman and must own every single movie, cartoon, ect..
But for me, the most entertaining this on this DVD was watching the ads for The Dark Knight (which I already saw. Sad that the ads for a movie I already saw are more interesting than the actual movie from the disc they're from), and a sneak peek at a new Wonder Women movie coming out next year.",1216771200,5,4172,4.527152317880795

Here are complete synopses of the six stories (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!)

Have I Got A Story For You (Studio 4C)

Written by Josh Olson. A street kid meets with three of his friends at a skate park. All three of them claim to have seen Batman earlier that day. Batman's battle with the Man in Black, a high-tech criminal, is told in reverse chronological order, with three very different interpretations of Batman's form and abilities: one describes him as a living shadow that can melt away and reappear at will (similar to Vampire Batman), another describes him as a half-bat, half-man creature (similar to Man-Bat), and one describes him as a combat robot called RoBat. At the end, Batman pursues the Man in Black to the skatepark, and captures him with the help of the fourth street kid. The fourth kid is able to see what Batman truly is after seeing him sustain injuries from the battle: a warrior in a Batsuit. He proceeded to tell his experience to his friends after Batman disappeared. Though the film credits give ""story by"" acknowledgment to first-time writer Jordan Goldberg, Josh Olsen acknowledged it was actually based on a very similar story by Frank Robbins called ""The Batman Nobody Knows""[5]. The story was first printed in Batman #250 in 1973, and subsequently adapted as ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" in the original Batman: The Animated Series. According to Olsen: ""The first time it's stealing, the second time it's borrowing, the third time you're creating a genre,"".[6]

 Crossfire (Production I.G.)

Written by Greg Rucka. Crispus Allen and Anna Ramirez are partners and members of the Major Crimes Unit that have been hand-picked by James Gordon. The two are assigned to take the recently captured Man in Black (captured during Have I Got A Story For You), revealed to be Jacob Feely, an escaped inmate from Arkham Asylum with an expertise in advanced electronics and explosives, to the Narrows to be incarcerated. On their way, they argue over whether Batman can be trusted, with Allen saying that they're just running errands for a vigilante, while Ramirez replies that Batman has changed Gotham for the better. As they are heading back, Allen declares his intention to leave the MCU, and Ramirez pulls into a vacant lot to confront Allen. However, the two get caught in a confrontation between gangs, The Russian and Sal Maroni. Maroni's men are gunned down, and Maroni takes refuge behind Allen and Ramirez's patrol car, which The Russian subsequently destroys with a rocket launcher. Ramirez and Maroni manage to get clear in time, while Allen is rescued by Batman, who proceeds to take out The Russian and his men. Maroni then threatens to kill Ramirez, but he, too, is dispatched by Batman. Batman recognizes Allen and Ramirez as Gordon's hand-picked officers, remarks that Gordon is a good judge of character, and disappears.

 Field Test (Bee Train)

Written by Jordan Goldberg. An accident involving a new WayneCom satellite's gyroscopic electromagnetic guidance system gives Lucius Fox an idea for a device that will electromagnetically deflect small-arms fire. Bruce Wayne takes the device and attends a charity golf tournament being held by developer Ronald Marshall, with whom he discusses the mysterious death of a woman, Teresa Williams, who had opposed some of Marshall's plans. During the tournament, Wayne secretly takes Marshall's PDA device. Later that night, as Batman, he hijacks a boat owned by Sal Maroni and drives it alongside a boat owned by rival gang leader The Russian and proceeds to attack both gangs at once, with assistance from his new device. He attempts to force a truce between the two gang leaders until he can get evidence against them, but is disrupted when one of Maroni's men fires at him. The bullet deflects and instead hits one of The Russian's men. Distressed, Batman takes the injured man to the hospital.

 In Darkness Dwells (Madhouse)

Written by David S. Goyer. The police respond to a riot in a cathedral where Cardinal O'Fallon was giving a sermon. According to eyewitness testimony, the Cardinal was abducted by a large lizard-monster and taken down into the crypts below the cathedral. Lieutenant Gordon, Crispus Allen, and Anna Ramirez investigate; Gordon has a brief conversation with Batman, who agrees with Gordon's theory that the Scarecrow's fear toxin is behind the riot as the doctor has been at large since the riot at the Narrows (during the event of Batman Begins). Batman gives Gordon an earpiece that will allow them to stay in contact and descends below ground, trying to find Cardinal O'Fallon and his abductor. A homeless man living in an abandoned subway station identifies the abductor as Killer Croc. Batman and Gordon briefly discuss the villain's past, but are cut off when Killer Croc himself shows up, under the influence of the fear toxin, and attacks Batman. Batman defeats him, but not before sustaining a bite that transfers some of the toxin to him. He then finds Cardinal O'Fallon being put on trial and sentenced to death by the Scarecrow, who is unhappy with O'Fallon's efforts to help the homeless. Batman leaps in to defend the Cardinal. Using the methane already present in the room, he sparks an explosion that destroys several water pipes, flooding the area and allowing him to escape with the Cardinal. Gordon appears in a helicopter to retrieve the Cardinal and offers to help Batman as well, but Batman refuses, saying, ""Maybe next time.""

 Working Through Pain (Studio 4C)

Written by Brian Azzarello. Continuing on from In Darkness Dwells, Batman is shot in the stomach by a man hallucinating in the sewers of Gotham. He cauterizes the wound and attempts to get out from underground, reflecting on his experiences with managing pain as he does so. First, he remembers volunteering with a relief effort and assisting a doctor in performing surgery without anesthesia. Next, he reflects on the lessons he learned from a woman named Cassandra, who was cast out of her community for disguising herself as a boy in an attempt to join a religious sect. Over several months, she teaches him to minimize his pain to the point where he can control it, sleeping on a bed of needles or standing on hot coals without reacting. One night, several young men appear to harass Cassandra, who takes their blows without seeming to feel them. Bruce steps in to defend her, not only demonstrating his ability to withstand their attacks, but defeating them all with his martial arts skills. Cassandra then tells him to leave, saying that he has learned what he came to learn. She then comments on how Bruce's pain was beyond her, or possibly even his, ability to handle, but how it also appeared to be leading him down a path he desired. Back in the present, Batman ends up in a gutter, where he discovers a cache of guns buried in the garbage. Alfred arrives to assist him and tells Batman to give him his hand so he can pull him out of the gutter, but Batman, arms full of guns, replies that he can't.

 Deadshot (Madhouse)

Written by Alan Burnett. Bruce Wayne has a flashback to the murder of his parents. In his penthouse, he examinines the firearms he took from the underground tunnel's gutter (during the event of Working Through Pain) which he intends to turn in to the police. Wayne admits to Alfred that even though he vowed never to use them in the memory of his parents, he can still understand the temptation to use one. Meanwhile, in another city, an assassin known as Deadshot carries out an assassination on a local mayor and returns to his tropical base. There, one of his associates hires him to carry out a hit in Gotham. It is revealed that The Russian has put out a hit on Lieutenant Gordon, and Batman is called in to protect him. Batman gives Crispus Allen Ronald Marshall's handheld PDA device (which he stole as Bruce Wayne in Field Test), containing a link to encrypted e-mails proving that Ronald Marshall hired Deadshot in the past. He then follows Gordon's motorcade, with Alfred providing satellite-imagery assistance using the new WayneCom satellites. Deadshot attempts to shoot Gordon from a moving train, but Batman deflects the bullet. Deadshot then gleefully reveals that Batman was his real target the entire time, and that the threat against Gordon was merely a ruse to draw him out. He opens fire as the train enters a tunnel, and as Batman attempts to charge Deadshot, he is injured, falling off the train. Deadshot advances to where he saw Batman fall, gloating, but is ambushed from behind and disarmed. He and Ronald Marshall are arrested. Wayne confides to Alfred about how similar the fight in the tunnel seemed to the night his parents were murdered, and comments that ""I've been trying to stop those two bullets all these years."" He expresses discouragement, and Alfred agrees, but adds that he thinks Bruce has a higher purpose. Wayne looks up at the sky and sees the Bat-Signal.

Kevin Conroy, the iconic voice behind the Darkknight Detective in the '90's, returns to give voice to Gotham's protector for this project. Not only are there the six interlocking stories on Disc 1 of the special-edition set, but there are more goodies on Disc 2. A Mirror For The Bat gives us a look at the Batman's greatest villains in a 35-minute presentation which explores how without the villains, the hero would not be as strong, with some of the producers of the project, as well as DC Comics editors and artists and writers. Batman And Me: The Bob Kane Story is a revealing look at the creator of The Dark Knight and the early days of the comic-book incarnation and a biography on Kane, as told by his biographer and by family and friends, a terrific tribute to Kane, who passed away in 1998. Finally, as an extra-special bonus feature, four episodes of the iconic Batman: The Animated Series are presented by producer Bruce Timm-Heart Of Ice, I Am The Night, Legends Of The Dark Knight and Over The Edge. This DVD set is terrific, and the short 73-minute movie is a great bridge between the two Christopher Nolan feature films, which is what it is intended to be. I highly recommend this DVD set for all Bat-fans as well as movie fans, though it is very bloody in parts and skirts an R-rating (the film is rated PG-13). I don't recommend that kids watch the feature (let them watch the less-violent episodes of the Animated Series instead).",1216684800,,12615,4.7652495378927915

of you who love the techno cartoons. The artwork is
very good but it's hard to watch and the stories are
just boring! Bad Idea! I purchased because Kevin Conroy
from the animated series did the voice and was a good
choice but it's nothing like that animated series. The
artwork made you feel you were reading a comic book and
the stories were well written and directed which is something
this dvd doesn't have. I know many of you will disagree but
there is something to keeping things simple and stop trying
to make cartoons seem like real people! Bring back the Batman
from the animated series and I'll buy it again! but not this!",1216684800,4,685,4.4015748031496065

Supposedly these episodes within the dvd represent things that have occured between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.  By the way, I saw the Dark Knight, and it is totally awesome, so I'm not a Batman antagonist at all.

But these episodes on this dvd are horrible.  Bad stories, poor animation, lousy point of view and nothing to do with the movies.  No plot, no story flow, no characterization, and nothing to keep my interest.  It's too bad that the makers of this dvd wasted their time and ours, not to mention our money, as nothing can save this poor turkey from the garbage can it deserves.  Even Batman with all his skills and gadgets would be hard pressed to save this dvd from a well deserved death.",1216684800,6,804,4.580419580419581
3384016,4,B001614F0S,"The Good Things
*Good animation quality and style(s).  Lots of detailed images without overloaded use of computer-generated effects.
*Each short story ventures into a different looks of character design and animation.  It's good for those who are unaccostumed to anime, because they get to see a broad spectrum of styles.
*Dark, wicked style remains consistent with the newest Batman movies (and original comic).
*Good collection of various stories (interlinked, but very very loosely).  Each contains a little bit of good action and drama.
*Pretty good characterization; get to see a little more of Batman's background, and a lot more of the urban myth element.
*A few good bad guys (Deadshot probably being the best; you also get to see Killer Croc, Scarecrow, some guy in a black suit, and the Russian mafia).
*Good dramatic music (but not the same themes as any of the Batman films).

The Bad Things
*Pretty short; seems like there could have been more meaningful stuff put into it.  In particular, the stories don't really tell one coherent story, so it all seems like just another offshoot of the Batman saga (the ""Animatrix"" actually added something to the ""Matrix"" saga, whereas ""Gotham Knight"" doesn't add much to the ""Batman"" series.  It's not requisite watching).

The Questionable Things
*The dark atmosphere and bloody violence makes the show edgy, but is not reccomended for kids (rated PG-13).

Like the ""Animatrix,"" this film provides an array of interesting short stories in different styles and perspectives.  As noted above, however, ""Gotham Knight"" falls a little short.  The storyline(s) offer nothing really spectacular.  But it does provide a little more insight on the character and the mythology of Batman.  Above all, it looks slick and has some good action scenes (and that's all I really cared about anyway).  It's great for anybody who is interested in anime or is a big big fan of Batman, but most casual viewers may be dissapointed.

The disc has good video and sound quality (and is quite splendid on Blu-ray).  Single-disc version doesn't appear to have any special features.  The two-disc and Blu-ray versions have a few featurettes, trailers (including the 2009 release of ""Wonder Woman""), and four episodes from the ""Batman Animated Series.""",1216684800,3,2277,5.130081300813008
3384017,3,B001614F0S,"This is a very hit or miss kind of film. The animation on the blu-ray disc in quality is phenomenal Batman in high-def is worth every penny I paid for this Blu-Ray, but unfortunately, at least for me anyway, the stories themselves were a bit lackluster in terms of length and the fact that Bruce Wayne is not Japanese. The initial concern I had with the Anime animation was exactly what I got with the very culturally confused vision of Bruce Wayne that was put in ""Field Test"" and Kevin Conroy was spot on as Batman as usual but hearing his voice come out of that figure was like hearing Larry the Cable Guy speaking in spanish which I saw in a spanish language version of Blue Collor Comedy Tour Rides Again but anyway I got side tracked.

The length of the stories were nothing we haven't seen but in vein of the occasion I think they could sprung for a few more minutes to each story just to cohesively bond them a little better to the stories before. It felt like I was watching a choppy internet feed of something that was promoted as worth while. I have great respect for everyone that made this happen but lord almighty it could have been so much better.

Don't compare this to anything that you might love about Batman it has those things that make Batman whatever this character is to you but it makes you somehow miss Batman: The Animated Series even more after seeing this. Gotham Knight is like having your favorite NFL team make it to the conference finals only to lose in the final seconds and not make the Superbowl. Not a waste of money in the slightest but defintely not worth the wait and anticipation that was given to it.",1216598400,,1642,4.3980263157894735
3384018,4,B001614F0S,"Far away and practically apart from the sometimes aberrant and misplaced versions with live-action superheroes, Animation remains the most ideal  medium to adapting comic books on screen. Te freedom of expression and designing in animation allows for more energy, details and scope, and the unlimited resources and effects used  to portray any paralel universe imaginable with a self-realism and eloquence taken for granted for the die-hard fans, provide the logic equation and platform in wich classic characters live in perfect harmony with their fantastic environement with endless posibilities for deploying the true potential of their own legends.

The dark caped crusader can't be an exception, specially after the enormous succes of  ""The Dark Knight"" and all the expectations implied in such a tremendous release. These series of short films of different famed Asian Anime directors inspired in the myth of the classic DC character, have an obvious appeal for Animation fans, but the surprising and innovative substance showed in some of these shorts can actually convince a fan of the Batman series, call it comic books or filmic sagas, into fully enjoying the kinetic and beautiful market of stunning action and outstanding design. The arquitecture and texture of the different styles displayed in these amazing stories, trascend over the established stereotypes  of collective comic-book wisdom, making the viewer vulnerable to new contemplations but at the same time hungry for more, calling the experience the nearest concept of true interest and involving not only in the spectacular and explosive show, but also in the dramatic consequences.

An intriguing and mature (PG-13) Art project anthology more than a cohesive whole, not all of the shorts live up to the expectations in a high demanding genre like Animation, but for fans of the adventures of Batman and Anime in general, this collection is a little gem. No one can argue with the level of talents involved, but the underlying flaw of the collection is balance, the hit-or-miss nature of the structure, a factor implied in the obvious diversity of visual styles, art visions of the Dark Knight myth, and illustrated narrative: Some stories are glorious celebrations of  action, other are cerebral detective thrillers. There's really no point of arguing about which stytle is better or worst, because this winning-loosing issue relies in the viewer's preference, and objectively all the different short-films include different perspectives and passions, and an incredible amount of imagination and graphic quality. Some ideas of both corners start with great punch, but eventualy felt truncated, so it's not always a matter choice, but challenge for the viewer and succesful accomplishment of concepts for the writers. Besides, 12 or more minutes are not enough to develop something more than a sketch, and empathy or other in-depth emotions can't be built in such short time, leaving only a mere visual spectacle, regardless of the impressive presentation.

Much like ""The Matrix"" offspring, the short film collection ""The Animatrix"", this series is more than  strictly complementary or a simple offshoot of possibilities about the main theme, but a very colorful catalog of  evocative visuals with not even the smallest sense of continuity or history to bring some coherency to the squizophrenic proceedings, felling more like an technical exercise rather than a complete vision.

That's the biggest flaw of these incredibly talented compilation markets: We can't like all the shorts, because the differences are sometimes diametrical. We become the judge of a talent contest in front of the screen, pick the winners and make them our favorites, but we can't really dispose of the losing contestants, so they become a burden that turns a large percentage of the disc in useless space (and money).

My recommendation: If you can, check more reviews of this product to get a detailded description on each short film and the director's backgrounds, then made your decision about this uneven collection. Here are some:

- Yoshiaki Kawajiri  (Ninja Scroll)
- Soshiro Nimishi (Tekkonkinkreet)
- Yasuhiro Aoki (Steamboy)
- Futoshi Higashide (Mobile suit Gundam)
- Toshiyuki Kubooka (Te secret of Blue Water)
- Hiroshi Morioka (Chronicle of the Wings)",1216598400,6,4318,5.349557522123894
3384019,4,B001614F0S,"With 6 Scenes, just at about an hour, the film is a bit skimpy. and erratic. However the visual graphics are quite stunning and as the film progresses the dialogue becomes tighter.  Different versions of artist renditions of Batman works more as a sampler than a full movie. So don't be mis-guided; this is not movie. The only villains portayed in this film are, Killer-Croc, Scarcrow & Dead-Shot. It is the Bonus Material which helps to enhance this collective.

The Two Disc Special Edition has excellent bonus material:

1. Mirror for the Bat--- is an excellent documentary analyzing all the villains opposing Batman throughout his career as crimefighter, and should not be missed.

2. The Bob Kane Story---is a documentary on Batmans creator.

3. Bruce Timm Presents 4 Bonus Batman The Animated Series Episodes

I highly reccomend the Special Edition. Mirror for the Bat is a great documentary

Overall I cannot conceive giving Batman Gotham Knight a 5 star rating. Because it did not contain a consistent theme. But the dark underground nature of this film gives a much better portrayal of Gotham's Dark Violent Underside than any other film conceived.

A little bit of action here and there, none truely eye-catching or worth noting. I watched the whole thing waiting for it to get better, and the super short stories were actually so boring it made them feel longer than a petty 12-13 mins each.  some of the same villians (i think) appeared through various episodes, but the chronology was so out of whack you can't follow it, and as mentioned before the characters are drawn so outrageously different through various episodes you can't recognize who is who. in Azzarello's story bruce wayne is drawn so hideously he looks like an animated napoleon dynamite, not the handsome crime fighter you're expecting. my girlfriend even pointed out this point, and then proceeded to insult me for making her sit through such a crappy excuse for a batman story.",1216512000,5,1235,4.717592592592593

The final episode is really well drawn, but overall, the animation is nowhere near as nice or as good as the regular Batman Animated series, JLA, X-Men, etc.

Sadly, this film isn't nearly as good as ""...New Frontier"", and only slightly better than ""Superman - Doomsday"".

The idea behind this movie, aside from milking out a few bucks before the release of ""The Dark Knight"" (can't wait to see it tomorrow!), is to do what the people behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Animatrix/dp/B00008LDPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Animatrix</a>&nbsp;did; get some respected Japanese animation studios and have them make some shorts based on the movie(s).

In principle this isn't a bad idea, and for something like The Matrix series, which so clearly draws inspiration from anime, it might work very well. It works less well, however, for a universe like the one shown in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000BUYP4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, which is much more grounded in as much reality as any super-hero film can be.

The animation in the movie is decent, but nothing to write home about (of course I'm not some big-time otaku, so take that for what it's worth). The storylines are ok. One where Batman gets a device that keeps him safe from bullets works out ok, as does the one with Killer Croc, but overall none of the stories are that great.

There are some good things, though. It's always great to hear Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman/Bruce Wayne. He really nails it and does a great job with both characters. All the rest of the voice-acting is quite good, too.

But where this set really shines is in the extras. There's a great biography of Bob Kane (and people like me will get a real big laugh out of the ""News On Parade"" feature at the begining). My favorite extra, however, is the four episodes of the animated Batman series, which includes two of my favorite episodes from the show.

Ultimately I give really only one, maybe two, stars for the movie itself, but with those extras the set gets a boost up to three stars! Still not great, but at least I don't feel ripped-off by it.",1216339200,27,2744,6.224274406332454

The first of the 6 stories was by far my least favorite.  I really disliked the animation style, and the storyline was weakly executed.
Honestly, the whole set seemed disorganized and disjointed, and while I was mildly entertained, I certainly wasn't thrilled or going ""wow.""

I'm glad to have bought the Blu-ray and encourage the studio to bring us more innovative releases such as this one.

I also wanted to say that some of the animation was great while others were kind of experimental. Different techniques and styles are used to tell the 6 stories and I welcomed them all. I liked the Batman Animated animation but it doesn't hold up to the animation you will see on this disc. Kawajiri's art in one of the story's was amazing.

The writing is bad. Really bad and really obvious.  Amazing Goyer let his name remain on this (he has one segment), but he's had his klunkers before.  The stories ALL lack for inspiration or invention.  The whole time, you're yearning for some snap, some smarts.  It never comes.  Most of the animation is even worse.  The last piece felt a little more evenly constructed and satisfying, only because the segments preceding that one were so jaw-droppingly bad.

The animation character design in a couple of pieces is so utterly lacking in any kind of grace or artistry, it's all the more evident that this thing was farmed out with no central artistic oversight, no vision, in an attempt to squeeze more money out of the BATMAN franchise....as if it were just an after-thought from the marketing department, handed off to Chris Nolan's assistant (who sadly will be stuck with the creative blame for this dreck for years to come) to keep it ""in the family"".

It's really a shame, as Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT promises to be terrific, deep, a hallmark of modern blockbusters.  To even associate ""Gotham Knight"" with THAT movie is just a crime.

Don't waste your money.  This has nothing of the inventiveness or intrigue or artistic integrity of ""The Animatrix.""  This is sheer junk spewed out to suck your money quick.  14-year old fanboys will eat it up.  But if you've got any kind of standard for entertainment, this isn't even worth a rental.

Four episodes of the old Bruce Timm BATMAN animated series are on the bonus features.  Just BUY that series, and leave this to the junk heap of avaricious studio hacks.",1216252800,12,1811,4.695238095238095
3384032,3,B001614F0S,"Similar to the treatment it gave the Matrix sequels (remember Animatrix?), Warner Bros. has released a new dvd of Batman-inspired, anime-styled shorts in anticipation of ""The Dark Knight"" with mixed results. Here's a quick rundown:

""Have I Got a Story For You""- a group of teenage kids share their stories of having ""met"" Batman. Basically, this is an excuse to see a few varying incarnations of the ol' caped crusader as a Most Batman fans have seen this kind of thing before. Not much to this short, actually. Rating: * out of ****

""Crossfire""- Two Gotham detectives find themselves in the middle of a gang shoot-out. Batman shows up and kicks a lot of butt. I particularly admired the animation in this violent short. This was also the short where I learned that Batman is apparently fireproof (??). Rating *** out of ****

""Field Test""- We get a glimpse of Lucius Fox in this short. Batman tries out a new gadget while busting up a bunch of gangsters at the Gotham City docks. After one of the criminals is mortally wounded, Batman races to save his life. Rating ** out of ****

""In Darkness Dwells""- Batman goes head-to-head with anime-version of Killer Croc then is infected with a dose of Scarecrow's scare toxin. The look of this short is very different to the two that preceded it, and it certainly focused on style over substance. I gave this one an extra star considering we're treated to a double-dose of villainy with both Croc and Scarecrow. Rating *** out of ****

""Working Through Pain""- An injured Batman flashbacks on being trained on how to deal with pain. The slower pace of this short makes it seem twice as long as most of the others, but some fans may appreciate the insight into Bruce Wayne/Batman's character. Rating ** out of ****

""Deadshot""- Batman must defeat an assassin with incredible aim. Personally, I thought this was the strongest entry on the dvd. Great animation, interesting premise, a good villain, and plenty of Batman kicking villainous booty. Rating **** out of ****

Don't look for continuity here; there's really none between the shorts. Each is a 12 minute mini-movie of its own right.

The voice work was fine, and fans of Batman: The Animated Series will certainly be happy with the inclusion of Kevin Conroy. Other than the first short, I thought the animation was quite good, but if you're not a fan of anime, this will not change your mind. I liked the design and style of some shorts more than others. The shorts are... well, too SHORT to really engage you in plot or characterization.

The double disc version is worth getting for the extra episodes of Batman: The Animated Series alone. Sadly, there is no commentary or introductions for these episodes.

Overall, Gotham Knight is a mixed bag. It certainly won't blow you away, but for serious Batman fans, it will serve as something new and different to add to your collection.",1216252800,5,2884,4.738522954091817
3384033,3,B001614F0S,"I had very high hopes for this dvd, but wasn't very impressed. The new Batman seems to capture realism. which you won't get from these stories, most of it was very fake. The fact that there were 6 stories animated by 6 different people, and none of them really linking to each other made it hard to finish. Each one of the stories are good on its own, but its weird to see a young long haired Bruce Wayne then see and older wiser man on the next story.

On its own, it is a pretty cool super hero animated show, but when i watch Dark Knight, I won't be able to bridge Begins, Gotham knight, and Dark Knight like i did for Star Wars II, Clone Wars, and III.

In a nutshell, If you love Anime, and love Batman, Buy it, but if your just wanting to see a Batman Begins 1.5 your out of luck.",1216252800,2,786,4.0
3384034,3,B001614F0S,"Batman Gotham Knights is a hugh budget production with a well voiced cast with an innovative approach -- six stories with different writers and animators.  This of course involves some hit or miss ideas.
  ""Have I Got a Story For You""
  A pointless rewrite of a great Batman Animated Series episode called (""Legends Of the Dark Knight"") This works half as well but is somewhat compensated with impressive background animation that gives the city a real sense of place.
  ""Crossfire""
  Not a very crafty story that focuses on why we need Batman.  Been done before in many alterations on Batman Animated Series and is very unconvincing.
  ""Field Test""
  Another throw away with a pointless excursion into an idea that goes nowhere. Don't make Lucius Fox into a James Bond 'Q'
  ""In Darkness Dwells""
  One of the best episodes examining Batman's battle with Killer Croc.  Excellent dramatic tension and a fine action story as we see the interaction between Batman and Gordon.  Why couldn't this have been the starting story!
  ""Working Through Pain""
  A nice episode examining Bruce's past with a great ending that leaves you thinking rather than just wrapping up the episode.
  ""DeadShot""
  Another great entry with excellent animation and a great battle scene.  I was spellbound.

  All in all this is a major disappointment.  It just shows how bad script writing can ruin a great idea.  Again the first three should never have been made.  The last three though make up for it but creates the valid argument that this is a rental vs. a keeper.",1216166400,3,1542,4.844961240310077
3384035,5,B001614F0S,"Combining some of the greatest writers in the business, Gotham Knight is a 6 story movie that focuses on how Bruce Wayne went from The Batman to The Dark Knight.

Have I Got A Story For You: Starts off the movie with a group of kids telling stories of their encounters of the Batman. They are ranging from him being a shadow creature that can disappear and re-appear at will, to simply a giant bat. This isn't the best start to the movie but it gives us an idea of how Batman is perceived by those in the Gotham world.

Crossfire: Is a story based around two cops, Detectives Ramirez & Allen. Allen & Ramirez are dropping a criminal off at an insane asylum and on the journey we're subjected to the hatred that the man has for the Dark Knight. He doesn't like vigilantes but after being caught in a crossfire between the Russians & the Italians, Allen's mind is changed when the Batman shows up.

Field Test: Is a vision of a young Batman trying out the new gadgets created by Lucius Fox, but after an accident caused as a result of one of the gadgets, Wayne decides towards other means of protection.

In Darkness Dwells: Written by David Goyer, writer of Blade and co-writer of Batman Begins. The Dark Knight finds himself in the sewers of Gotham City where he's forced to take on Killer Croc and once again fight the Scarecrow.

Working Through Pain: This shows us the interesting past of Bruce and how he was taught the skill of handling pain.

Deadshot: The title speaks for itself as in this finale we're shown the real reason why Batman hates guns as he's forced to take on the might of the man that never misses.

I went into this film with a bit of skepticism as I'm not usually a fan of the anime style of animation. However, the short stories featured in this feature length animation are astounding and shed some light on the Batman character. The whole anime style is not for everyone, and I must say before I saw this I hated the style myself. After seeing this I come to realise that this style of animation has a way of showing real emotion through clever imagery. Be warned though, to those parents of children who are fans of the Batman series and are thinking of buying this for their kids, it has its moments of graphic violence and colourful use of language.

Overall this is a great little time waster and something that you can watch and be pleasantly entertained by",1216166400,,2389,4.425968109339408

A comparison that has been made is to the Animatrix, and it is a good comparison, because it really is the same thing, with the exception that this is Bat territory. Any fan of Batman will enjoy it. Be careful, though, as it does contain blood and violence, so it may not be recommended for the little ones.",1216166400,,559,4.490196078431373

I liked the first story better than any others.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there were some parts of the stories that didn't get explained enough and seeing Bruce Wayne drawn by different artists, made me have to guess who he was in a few stories until someone said his name.

3384043,4,B001614F0S,"Taking a concept from the AniMatrix, the Magic behind DC brings you a wonderful collection of stories about the Gotham Knight in preparation for the next film. DC continues their adventure into PG13 films with our beloved heroes at the helm, and it is a wonderful ride. Like Superman: Doomsday, Gotham Knight is darker (as dark as our Dark Knight can get in a PG13 film). The images are creative, but it is the stories that blow me away.

The series opens up with a group of skaters recalling their own versions of Batman tackling the same villian throughout Gotham. This ploy has been used in the Batman animated series, but it still works on DVD. And from there the acts take a life of their own. Each act is different from the next, telling a different story, but with a surprisingly delicate theme built throughout that only emerges in the wonderfully powerful fifth act (Work through the pain).

If you pick up on the subtle message about Batman's quest and guns, then the directors have succeeded in their vision of exploring what makes Batman tick.

I rate Gotham Knight four stars, because by seperating the stories into different acts, I think it cheapens the messsage the writers and directors had in mind. Gotham Knight can easily be made into feature animated movies about Batman night out in Gotham. The episodic nature of the movies throughs me off.

As added bonus, for those patiently waiting for the live action WonderWoman film, there is a sneak peek into the animated movie. It looks to be just as edgy and aggressive as the Batman and Superman films.",1215907200,,1570,4.698181818181818
3384044,3,B001614F0S,"'Batman: Gotham Knight' is a series of six animated shorts, each featuring its own creative vision of the Dark Knight. This format has its strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand it's interesting to see a variety of interpretations of Batman, but on the other, none of the stories are long enough to be satisfyingly developed. There is a loose story thread that runs through the entire piece, but it is weakly executed and doesn't really make the movie cohere. Conversely, the use of the same voice actors throughout doesn't allow each short to feel distinct (while I LOVE Kevin Conroy as Batman, he doesn't sound appropriate for most of the ""Gotham Knight"" character designs). Finally, the different looks for Batman aren't all that different. They're all dark, moody and kinetic, and they all fit into about three schools of anime aesthetics.

But it's not all bad. The production value is high and it's clear the creators were passionate about crafting this movie. The backgrounds are lush, the character designs are intricate and the animation is well executed. And the stories are decent concepts, they just don't have enough time to breathe. I'd recommend ""Gotham Knight"" for Batman or anime fans, but anybody more casually interested should definitely rent this before they buy it.",1215907200,4,1290,5.02803738317757
3384045,5,B001614F0S,"Batman, Gotham Knight was supposed to fill in the spots left between Batman begins and the Dark Knight movie released on July 18. It is a multi-part tale of stories deplicting Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, the Batman, as he deals with his struggle to get some kind of balance in his new life. The first tale, 'Have I Got a Story for you', is 4 teens and their experience of watching Batman take down a criminal in their own words and imaginations. It is only at the last point in the story, where the 4th kid watches the real Batman, wounded and hanging on to stop the assailant in a fog of smoke, come out of nowhere to get an assist. This tale seems to be separate from the other 5 as the stories all begin to interrelate, using two detectives off Lt Gordon's detail, help Batman return a crook back to the island prison last seen in 'Begins' in a tale called Crossfire. ""Field Test' is a tale as Bruce Wayne tests out a new device created by Lucius Fox that can deflect bullets while getting information on murders being commited by a sharpshooter. In Darkness Dwells is possibly the most atmosperic episode as it shows Batman going into the sewers to find a priest kidnapped by the Scarecrow and his accomplice, Killer Croc. Both look terrifying and children should be warned that Gotham Knights goes beyond PG-13. Surviving the fight but getting wounded leads Bruce to remember his training on manging pain and giving us a quiet tale called 'Working Through Pain' where he met a female sensai. This episode has one of the most definitive scenes in Batman history when it concludes. The final story, is Batman risking his life to stop Deadshot, the assasin, from another victim. In all of the stories, japanese animation is used to deplict details and facial reactions that are truly fresh in spinning a Batman tale and hopefully this will lead to another series where many people had a bad taste in The Batman series that was on kids WB not too long ago.",1215907200,,1960,4.53954802259887

For anyone who came into this DVD expecting it to be similar to the Animatrix...it's not.

For anyone expecting this to be worth watching...your call, but I don't think so.

After watching it, it was HEAVILY influenced by Japanese animation techniques, and looks somewhat like a median between Avatar and Princess Mononoke. The mouths were never matched to what was said, and it was very dark.

This style of animation had considerable amounts of blood (for animation), and I would not recommend this for children, even though I absolutely love Batman:TAS.

It is not a third Batman movie and will not wow everyone into forgetting that The Dark Knight comes out 2 weeks later.  It is, however, an enjoyable look at a string of related (yes, they are related) events in between Batman Begins and Dark Knight.  Are there plots holes, inconsistancies, and completely incorrect statements?  Absolutely.  Is it enjoyable visually and creatively? You bet.  The animation is stunning and most of the stories are very enjoyable.  Some of the depictions of Batman/Bruce are questionable, but there are enough consistancies (the Narrows, Scarecrow, Lt. Gordon) to confirm you are watching a Gotham that pretty closely resembles the one from the movie(s).  All in all, this is very impressive visually and creative in its presentation.  If you own Batman Begins and plan on seeing Dark Knight opening weekend, buy this.  If you own more than one copy of Batman Begins and more than 5 Batman DVDs of one kind or another and will be waiting in line on Thursday for Dark Knight, you will be so disgusted with the plot holes and inconsistancies, you probably won't be able to get past them to enjoy it.

The animation for a few of the stories came close to looking right for Batman but most did not, and some of it was ugly.  The stories were too short to develop properly so as a result they are mostly shallow and uninteresting.  Apparently, the idea was that they were to tie together to tell a larger story but I did not see that happen.

The best thing about this effort was the return of Kevin Conroy to the part that he made his own.  I would have given two stars just for his work, but decided to give it one to balance all those who gave it five stars before they even saw it.",1215820800,11,735,4.0979020979020975
3384050,3,B001614F0S,"I was very close to purchasing this dvd on the day it was released. I am very glad that I didn't spend the money to own this movie. I was expecting some kind of bridge between the new Batman films - Begins and Dark Knight - which is definitely not what this is at all. I am not a die hard fan of DC Comics, but I enjoy the batman films...of course with exception to the disastrous Batman and Robin. What were they thinking ?!? All the cheesy one liners are rediculous...especially Arnold...yikes.

  Anyway, back to the point. This movie is aimed more for the comic fan, in my opinion. Some of the stories are based off of older comic book ideas, like who the Batman really is etc.. This may be worth a rental just to check it out if your local place has it in stock, but I would rent it first before purchasing. If you aren't expecting what the movie has to offer, you can easily tune this out and turn it off before the 3rd short film. The only neat part of this set is the different approaches to the animation style, if you are in to that sort of thing. The artistic part of the films is very interesting to see, but the stories themselves are a little odd and hard to really get excited about.

  If you are a fan of Batman, or just have some spare time, it is worth seeing once. If you go into the dvd knowing that it doesn't have anything to do with the other movies, you should be alright. Because of the release date being so close to the opening of the Dark Knight, I was expecting something completely different. This mind set probably made this movie less enjoyable for me personally. All in all, like I mentioned, it is probably worth seeing once, but save your money until you know you want to own it.

3384052,5,B001614F0S,"Everywhere I've been reading about this movie I find some of the strangest comments and criticisms.  I see people totally missing the point and comparing it to things that have no business in the same conversation.  I've seen people giving some of the best chapters low grades, or even skipping over stories all together complaining that it doesn't have the Joker or Harvey Dent in it.

Doesn't everybody know what this is?  Don't you like Batman?  When you viewed this weren't you expecting dark and violent themes, crazy animation and art styles, a pool of varied talent and types of stories, some nice nods to the Nolan universe and the much larger world of the comics that rarely get rendered off the page, plus the high quality of work Bruce Timm and company always deliver?  Because you see that's exactly what I got.

What we have here is the first time we've seen some of the mature themes and situations inherent in the Batman world in animated form with a lot of the talent that made the animated series, that everybody loves and holds as a benchmark for Superhero animation, including Kevin Conroy the best voice of Batman we're likely to ever see.  In fact this may be his final performance as the character and it was nice to have him rendered in such different manners.

The stories are about as long as an Adult Swim or Three Stooges episode and the short form gives the feel of reading 6 single comics taking an issue to explore a theme or tell an interesting tale, all in the same continuity but by different creative teams.  ""Why doesn't it lead into the new movie"" and all those types of arguments are unfounded, it never claimed to do that it just takes place in the continuity of the new films meaning a more grounded universe.  Batman uses his glider cape, they comment on the aftermath of what happened in the Narrows, Lucius is specifically Bruce's tech go-to guy, Maroni and the mob (although I'm sure characterized completely different) make an appearance, the elevated trains and less industrial look of Gotham City and so on.  There are subtle nods and little bits of info but nothing more then some really cool Batman stories in a still expanding universe.

Did you really want to see some clumsy animated movie that pastes up the gaps between two well conceived films for the sake of marketing to the lowest common denominator of pop culture fan?

We get a great Bruce Wayne training story that expands on the idea not made clear enough in the first movie that he did more then just work with Ducard/Ra's, we also get young naive Bruce learning that cutting edge technology isn't enough to wage his war, we pick up on the fact that the Scarecrow/Crane has sunken more into darkness since what happened and we are introduced to the first ""creature"" of the Nolan universe, Killer Croc - also seen through fear toxin.  Also Gotham PD and young Gordon (although at times feeling too young) was well done and in the mode of what we are sure to see in the next movie.  Of course it also had some of those Batman moments that stand out among his best and send a childlike chill through you when someone just gets it right.

I only thing I will agree with is that I thought it was odd retelling the classic story of kids talking about the time they saw Batman but it was done so unique and different and it set up the varying styles of the film that it was in fact a pretty damn good idea and probably the reason they stomped out their internal doubts about starting off that way, and the concepts and animation in that one were cool and bizarre.

I don't know what else to say other then don't look it over, these movies have to sell good and not be picked apart but fanboys who don't know what they want in order for WB to continue to make these mature animated takes on the DC Universe.  It's full of great animation and art and although a few of the performances fall short at times I was more then happy with the voice acting which is always of a high caliber when Andrea Romano is involved.  Plus the special features are probably the best yet on these new PG-13 DVD films.

...and face it people, if The Dark Knight wasn't coming out in a week you would all be going insane over this thing.  Don't get picky, remember that there have been many times Batman wasn't doing so well.",1215820800,5,4307,4.47381864623244

Perhaps, that was because I assumed it would be more like the Animatrix, a series of disconected vignettes that enriched the ideas of the Matrix universe.
Gotham Knight did not do that. The animation styles were all too familiar, drab dialogue and the stories rehashed well defined aspects of Batman lore.  Even when the action got going the personifications of Batman did not have any heart or depth and I felt no connection with this usually engaging character. Worst of all, there seemed to be no connection with the upcoming movie, Dark Knight; the connections may become identifiable after I see the film, but this precursor did not further pique my interest.

My favourite episode, though, was ""Through the Pain,"" and was pretty cool in its own right.

If you were to take all the stories as a whole the ending feels like a bit of a cliffhanger. 2) The special features don't interest me enough to make the extra cost worth my while.

The life story of the late Bob Kane and his invention of Batman would make a great movie in and of itself I think.  The analysis of Batman and his villians is EXCELLENT.

The events of ""Knight"" are meant to take place between the""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" movies.

Nothing new or incredibly revealing happens and for as much as I wanted to like ""knights"" I was really disappointed. Some of the stories hit it out of the park animation wise but failed story wise and only a few succeeded in both fields.

""In Darkness Dwells"" 5/5 excellent animation and my pick for best short. Batman goes into the sewers of Gotham for a showdown between Scarecrow and killercroc to recuse a priest.

""Working through pain""4/5 Batman has a flash back to a time when he studied under a yogi master in oder to master pain. Interesting story and moral.

""Deadshot""2/5 Batman has a showdown with the old villain Deadshot. good action.

Disk two has a nice feature with an array of people who have worked on Batman though out the years. They offer excellent insight to the character and his relationship with his villains. One of the best Batman features I've seen. Disk two also has four selected episodes from the animated series all of them excellent choices. I'm still a little conflicted about ""Knight"" I think I was expecting too much but none the less it's definitely worth a view.",1215734400,5,1980,4.607954545454546
3384058,3,B001614F0S,"This movie, comprising 6 short stories, fails to really find a central theme that unites all six films, and the individual short stories aren't engaging enough to stand up on their own. With that said, there are a couple of gems amongst the six. Unfortunately, none of them are better than anything ""Batman: The Animated Series"" delivered.

The visuals and sound are excellent. Adam Conroy once again returns as the voice of Batman, and there is no better voice for Gotham's Dark Knight.

I'd reccommend this film only to serious Batman fans, or serious anime fans. If you're only into Batman because of Batman Begins, don't bother with this film.",1215734400,5,647,4.872727272727273
3384059,4,B001614F0S,"I was very excited about getting the special edition set and it didn't disappoint,except for the first chapter-I could have done without that segment as it really didn't make much sense. Once you get past that,the story is really awesome!! The animation is superb,particularly in the latter chapters and it was so nice to hear Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman once again-as many others have already said,CW's""The Batman""was a disappointment from that standpoint. If you purchase the two disc set,you're in for a treat as far as extras go-there is a super documentary on Bob Kane,the man who created the Caped Crusader and a wonderful piece on the villians of Gotham City. Also,the packaging is most unique-inside the protective cardboard sleeve is an awesome 3-D holographic image of Batman taking on Deadshot! The four bonus episodes of Batman are a nice addition also as is the sneak peek of the new Wonder Woman animated movie! I wholeheartedly recommend this,however I do caution parents that it may not be suitable for young children.",1215734400,,1042,4.994252873563219
3384060,4,B001614F0S,"...and more troublesome reviews. Now everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I would never say otherwise, but some of these reviews are unfair, biased and make no sense. First off, the animation is not terrible, in any of these short films. Anyone who says otherwise is ignorant of animation. They may not enjoy the STYLE of the drawings, but the animation, movement, camera angles, colors and backgrounds ranged from good to excellent in each film. Some of the figure drawing is poor, but it is definitely a minority rather than a majority of the figures that look off. There have been episodes of Batman the animated series (A show that i will always love) that were animated 1000 times worse than the worst animated film on this dvd (The Mechanic, Prophecy of Doom and The Strange Secret of Bruce Wyane come to mind)so there shouldn't really be a complaint in that department. Some people just hate Japanese animation and its style, to each their own, but don't review on a pre-existing bias. Kevin Conroy voices Batman in all of the shorts, and does a great job as usual. The stories range from ok to great, it is my first viewing, but as of now i would say Working through the pain, Deadshot and In Darkness Dwells really stand out. Have I got a story for you is very similar to the episode Legends of the Dark Knight from batman season 4, but the stories told in this short are all linked, and I think it is a clever short, and the riskiest of all the shorts. It presents batman in a more cartoony style, and I think it works very well, an unexpected and pleasant surprise. Working through the pain was excellent in showing more of Bruce Wayne's training, in medicine and pain endurance, it is very true to the spirit of the film maker's goals in Batman Begins, explaining how he came to be the brilliant crime fighter he is. The animation, in my humble opinion, is also superb. Crossfire's animation left a little to be desired from me, except for the end of the short, the story was a bit disjointed and boring, but the atmosphere was amazing, Arkham its doctors and inmates very creepy, and batman himself the epitome of cool. Even a weak short shows promise here. Field test had good animation, the faces were a little bland for me, but the interaction between Wayne and Lucious Fox was entertaining and enjoyable, the plot was interesting and at the end stayed extremely true to Batman's heart, he will risk his own skin, not anyone else's (not even a crook). In Darkness Dwells scores top marks from me in style and animation, it almost looks like Mike Mignola drew it, the designs of Croc and Scarecrow are great, and Gotham City is portrayed as gothic and creepy as it should. No complaints there. Deadshot was well animated, and a pretty good story, but it took the least risks i think, which is fine. Batman tries to foil an assassin, and tries to deal with his gun problem. People say the film doesn't link the two movies (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight)...but at this point in time Gotham Knight is not out in theaters, so how does anyone know it doesn't? The escape of Arkham prisoners is alluded to and its effects depicted in Crossfire, the fate of the escaped scarecrow explained in In Darkness Dwells, the Narrows mentioned, Gordon is continuing his quest of cleaning up the police force, the change he began in Batman Begins continues...plenty of links. The shorts aren't long enough to include EVERYTHING, there has to be something left for The Dark Knight, right? Why should the Joker be in this if he's going to have an entire movie devoted to him? And who really wants more Rachel Dawes? Not me (sorry thats bias...woops). As for the ""consistency"" issue, this is a collection of short films, if they were all the same the format would be pointless, and it would be boring. These are different visual interpretations. Batman isn't much of a detective in these shorts, I will concede, but he wasn't really much of one in Batman Begins either, was he? They still have to flesh that aspect out in the new franchise I feel. The bottom line, good animation, sometimes great, some very original stories, some interesting twists on stories we've seen, and some that just tread water, but tread it well. It's anime, if you like anime or have an open mind, try it. If you hate anime, or you are a slave to the continuity of the comics or Batman Begins, don't pick this up. Also, its annoying when people buy something they haven't rented or read reviews of and then rant about how they made a bad decision. Don't write a review of being an impulsive consumer, review the product. 3.5/4 stars give or take.
Thanks for reading this much too long review, whether you agree with me or not!",1215734400,2,4710,4.581753554502369
3384061,2,B001614F0S,"I just bought the single DVD version and was psyched to see a dark Batman animated DVD coming out.  Being a big fan, I had to get it.  Bottomline, its not worth the money.  Rent it first.  The first story is horrible.  The animation is off; Batman looks different in every story as does Bruce Wayne.  Each story is only 12 minutes long so there's not enough to satisfy you.  They'd be better off having fewer stories and making them longer.  They probably just released this for marketing since the movie comes out next week.  Too bad they didn't give us anything quality and just fluff to ""satisfy"" until the movie comes out.  Avoid this if you can.",1215648000,4,650,4.432203389830509
3384062,3,B001614F0S,"This new Batman DVD has impressive looking animation, but I found the story somewhat frustrating to follow at times.  The best of its six segments were those involving the villains Scarecrow and Deadshot (esp. the Deadshot tale), but others tended to be very artsy (such as the story about Bruce Wayne learning from a female sensei type).  The opening sketch is clever in its use of the skateboard kids and their perspectives of Batman's encounter with an enemy, but it's also ineffective as a story since it tells little about who the criminal is, what he did, etc.  In fact, all throughout the disc, I had a ""huh?"" reaction way too often, not understanding exactly what was happening or why.",1215648000,14,693,4.758333333333334
3384063,5,B001614F0S,"Ok, alot of people seem to have a problem with the animation, I, for one think it's amazing. If you like Anime-styled art, then you'll love this! The only segment that wasn't great in this movie was the first one; ""Have I Got A Story For You"" I don't think it's just horrible, It's kinda cool what people could think about Batman, but it doesn't really fit in with the rest of it, I think this could have been added as a bonus feature episode, and they could have focused more on the story than to add this into it. My favorite episode is ""Field Test"" It has a total anime feel to it, and Bruce Wayne resembles Light Yagmai (Death Note character) quite a bit, IMO. But you get more character out of Bruce in this one. I also enjoyed ""Dead Shot"" alot, the animation is very detailed in it. Although I'm not too crazy how they made Bruce look in it, it's still one of the best episodes.

I really enjoyed most of the episodes, the only problem with it is the storyline doesn't tie in all together just great, but if they had more time than 15 minutes a episode to make it, I think this could have been just amazing. But I still give this 5 stars as I've watched it 3 times and I have really enjoyed it alot. You get a Dark, More Violent, and Epic Batman in this mini-series movie. All Bat-fans should check this out! It will atleast give you something to do as you wait for ""The Dark Knight"" hahaha.",1215648000,2,1397,4.193308550185874
3384064,4,B001614F0S,"I'm not going to say this is the best animated batman ever, because honestly, it isn't. This DVD doesn't break new ground for Batman. It's not the end all be all of Batman. It isn't something I would hold up as being definitive Batman by any means.

What I will say is that this is a quality product that any Batman fan should enjoy. If you like your Batman grim, dark and violent, this should keep you very happy. These micro-stories are done very much in the style of the comic books.

That means each writer/animator is going to have their own flavor, their own touch that they bring to each segment. It is very much like Animatrix in that respect. One episode may not be your cup of tea. Another episode you may absolutely love. My own personal opinion, I didn't really care for ""Have I Got a Story For You."" ""Working Through Pain,"" gave me a luke warm reaction. ""Darkness Dwells"" and ""Deadshot"" were absolutely great. Just my own opinions.

Some have complained about the animation. These reviews I believe come from people who have had limited to no exposure to anime. Each of the episodes has a different style of animation, but are each very common styles of Japanese animation. Anyone who has had any in depth exposure to Japanese animation and has come to enjoy it should not have too many qualms with the animation.

I also like the fact that Kevin Conroy is back doing the voice acting of Bruce Wayne and Batman. At first I was afraid he'd only be in one of the segments and the sweetness would be short-lived. But he does, in fact, play Batman in all six episodes. For those who don't know who Kevin Conroy is (shame on you in the first place), he is the one who did the voice acting for Batman in the extremely popular Batman: The Animated Series. For anyone who watched that series, ""Kevin Conroy"" is nearly as synonymous with ""Batman"" as ""Adam West."" Hearing him doing the voice acting is very welcome. The fact that there are 4 bonus episodes from the Animated Series (Two DVD edition or Blu-Ray edition) is just icing on the cake.

There are one or two things I have to bring up as negatives, however. Parents should be wary of getting this for their kids. It is violent. There is blood. It should be screened before letting your children watch.

This also is not quite the connection between the first and second movies as was promised. Except for the fact that the Arkam breakout from Batman Begins is referenced a few times, you would hardly even know that this takes place in the same continuity as the films. It could easily just be set in it's own side-universe. Which for me is fine. I have no qualms with it being unrelated to the movies, but that wasn't really what was advertised.

This still boils down to a very entertaining collection of shorts that any Batman Fan should enjoy if they can just keep an open mind to the Japanese styled animation.",1215648000,4,2877,4.489483747609943
3384065,5,B001614F0S,"I watched this two disk dvd after reading reviews and spoilers.
It was way better than I expected and I think as for animated
Batman the mature adult versions are best. Warner/Dc have finally
figured Batman out. all stories will have you on the edge of your seat.
hopeful to see more like this. IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1215648000,4,331,4.928571428571429
3384066,4,B001614F0S,"I have to say that I am a fairly big Batman fan. I received this dvd today and I immediately watched it. And I liked it. It is certainly not as good as the Animatrix but its not bad either. It has no very visible connection with Batman Begins other than the design of the Batmobile in the short ""Field Test"".

The shorts are not too impressive but it is a lot of fun to see the different interpretations of Batman. I have to say that the two best shorts were ""In Darkness Dwells"" because of its simple (but still interesting) story written by David S. Goyer who helped Nolan write Batman Begins but more for its incredible style which fit Batman and his world perfectly with out looking to overly 'anime'

The second best short was ""Working Through Pain"" because of the story alone. The animation style was OK. But the story by 100 Bullets writer  Brian Azzarello was amazingly original and simple and felt like it could have been cut directly into ""Batman begins"".

Overall it was enjoyable Thats why I give it four stars. All of the stories except for the two noted above were OK. I wanted more original stories that could have given me insight to characters inside the movie like Rachel Dawes or the scarecrow (he has a very small cameo in the short 'In Darkness Dwells') or maybe a short about Jim Gordon fighting or firing corrupt police or something fresh.

If you liked this collection of shorts then you should definitely check out the Batman: Black and White series. it feels the same in every way. tons of well known and unknown artists and writers get to write shorts about batman in their own style. The first volume is great the second one is good.

If you are a Batman fan then you should certainly buy this to add to your collection",1215648000,2,1747,4.44375
3384067,3,B001614F0S,"I am an animation student and this is not poor animation, its the style that does not fit. All six of the pieces have beautiful animation and are well put together , it just does not feel like Batman. Batman to me is Gothic 1950's and this does not capture that imo.
  My favorite of all the episodes was the final one with Dead shot. I be leave it had the same animation crew that did the newer Vampire Hunter D movie , I wish the Warner Brothers Premier crew would have gave them all the money to make the whole film , that episode came closest to getting it right.
  The two disk version did have some nice features , it had a nice piece on Bob Kane the creator of Batman and also a fun featurette on Batman villains. My favorite feature has to be the 4 episodes of Bruce Timm's Batman the animated series all of them classics from that series , my personal favorite ""Over the Edge"" is awesome.
  So overall this is not a bad product just weak when compared to the last Warner Brothers premier release. I would like to get Bruce Timm alone, and off the record about this project , He as an animator is a minimalist and brilliant and  I would love to hear how he felt this turned out, I am willing to bet he is not happy.",1215561600,4,1223,4.11344537815126

Much like the Animatrix, you will see different styles, but I think any Batman fan will find at least 1 or 2 segments they like.  I picked up the steelbook version and I recommend it.  It was available at Best Buy but has since sold out at most locations.",1215561600,2,382,4.191780821917808
3384069,5,B001614F0S,"Oh my god I can't believe how amazing this is! Broken into six parts/stories each one with fantastic animation and incredible artwork. The first part has incredible detailed background. Usually they don't go to that much trouble. The only part I felt was lacking was story number four. In art not Story!

My two favorite parts was the first one because it was similar to an episode of batman the animated series: you know the one with the kids and their stories and there perceptions of batman. It takes you back but unlike that batman from what seemed like so long ago, the violence has been amped up! And the last one with Deathshot I never liked him because I always thought of him as the ""poor man's Bullseye!""

Another incredible thing is they got the voice of Kevin Conroy which is the Batman from the animated series. In my mind and heart the only real Batman.

Man this really deserves ten stars not five. See the animated version of Batman has always been better then the live action stuff. Because one: a real grown man dressed in a batsuit is ridiculus and animated grown man somehow looks natural and two: You can do stuff that you can't do in live action. As the six and final part proves! Actually there are a few things that can only be done by animation throughout the whole movie but then again six is my favorite.

Now if they could only do this with Superman. Adam Baldwin as Superman, I kept expecting Superman to rob a bank and side with the bad guy. Shouldn't typecast but he was really good as Jane. Just as Kevin is really good as Batman!!",1215561600,3,1563,4.435540069686411

Perhaps I'm a bit biased, I'm one of those Batman fans that never got past how badly Batman Begins sucks. I'm a classic fan, Adam West and Michael Keaton all the way.

If you want to see a dark Batman, pay attention to the character that MK played in Batman and Batman Returns. That's good Batman.

Just reading the first chapters made me excited to see the dvd, however i just watched it and i was vastly dissapointed! The stories are in six parts but they are shorter than short can be! I think the opening credits are longer than the entire dvd. Well the book has a point of a big crime that is happening that started with a murder of a woman. Well the 3 stories ignore the point and just bs some lame side tales that are as long as a commercial. Besides the 2 stories with scarecrow, killer crock (don't blink) and deadshot-witch are good-the dvd is a short let down. I advise reading the book first so you can know whats going on then watch the dvd for fun and the speacial features are short but good enough. I got this only beacuse i am a die hard batman fan, so in closing its a good collectors item but don't expect too much. Batman is american, lets keep it that way!

3384072,4,B001614F0S,"As a fan of both anime and Batman, I was thrilled to hear about this set months ago, and it did not dissappoint.

  Anime fans who are less open minded to American stories will dislike the storytelling, and American fans may be put-off by the animation; but if you are willing to appreciate the melding of different styles, you will like this.

  The Bob Kane Bio was interesting, but the villian feature provided no information that Batman fans didn't already know. All Batman the animated Series episodes included are great too. If you haven't picked up the sets of that series then this is worth it simply to get those episodes.

  I think most of the negative reviews are from people who had made up thier minds that they would dislike this from the begining (and after ""The Batman"" this does not surprise me) but if you come into it with an open mind you will like it.",1215561600,12,873,4.474683544303797

It was a pleasant surprise to hear that Kevin Conroy was back to voice Bruce Wayne/Batman. He was the same actor who voiced those characters in Batman TAS. The stories are good. The first one I believe is a loose remake of the ""Legends of Batman"" episode. Every kid has his/her own idea of who Batman is. What was cool is that their stories are all related and you catch a new piece of the story each time it is told. You also see how Batman experiments with new gadgetry and some of his training.

3384075,4,B001614F0S,"Was really looking forward to this DVD so excited to view when I saw the trailers.  However, the ""anime-style"" scenes from the trailer, ""edited"" quickly with commentaries from the producers and DC staff, were not as exciting when viewed in the context of the entire DVD.

Positives of DVD:  1. The visuals of Gotham city were fantastic!!  One of the great things of Batman, the Animated Series (BTAS) were the backgrounds of the dark off-kilter buildings.  Here, in this DVD, they are drawn in such a way as to make Gotham look both beautiful and ugly.  This is felt/drawn/highlighted in all six vignettes.  2. The voice of Conroy as Batman.  His voice has so much texture... it is the ""voice of Batman."" 3. The last two stories are great.  Well illustrated and plotted they add to the ""Batman mythos."" 4. The updated designs of the costumes of both Batman and his villains in many of the episodes are interesting and unique.

Negatives:  I think that the negatives are derived from how this project was designed. The DVD is touted as a bridge for the upcoming summer 08 Batman movie and Batman Begins (In fact, the director, is the author of one of the middle episodes).  The vignettes are authored by well known American writers, overseen by the guys that brought you BTAS, and illustrated by well-known anime artist.  Although on the DVD, Timm and co. emphasized that they gave the anime artists full rein, it must have been difficult for them to work on these projects.  Imagine, as an artist, directing a very protected American icon"" whose every step has to be OK'ed by DC Comics, making sure it hypes a ""big-budget American summer movie,  following a script written in a foreign language and coordinating your animation with 5 other animators.  As an artist I would go crazy, I am surprised that the product came out as well as it did!!!

So given the obstacles listed above, my negatives are the following:  1. starting the DVD with an episode which plot is very similar to one of my favorite BTAS episodes. The episode from BTAS, in which three kids talk about their experience and POV of Batman is charmingly drawn in different ""Batman style;"" the original campy style, a gruffy Frank Miller style...etc.  That episode, funny and well drawn, makes this new anime episode suffer in comparison.  The episode is not funny at all and the kids and Batman are drawn in a stylistic manner that is almost too painful to watch  2. The middle episode, in which both Batman and Bruce Wane are drawn in the childlike ""anime"" style.  To see Bruce Wayne drawn looking like he is 15 years old (especially as the other characters look age-appropriate) was so distracting that I had a hard time following the plot. I know that that type of drawing is a Japanese construct, but the main theme and premise of the Batman myth is the loss of childhood and innocence when Bruce's parents are killed and the subsequent metaphorical ""birth"" of justice which is what Batman represents. Drawing Batman and Bruce in a childlike fashion is almost a direct contradiction of the myth.  I cannot visually digest the images of childlike Batman and Bruce, especially in the dark context of these episodes.",1215561600,5,3182,4.73502722323049
3384076,1,B001614F0S,"This is just a collection of random Batman cartoons. First off the animation is just horrible. Second, have the people who made these episodes ever even read a Batman comic. The stories are pitiful. The art in some of the episodes is passable, but mostly it just annoys. The first episode being the worst drawing I think I've ever seen, Ren & Stimpy was better done. If I go on any longer my review will seem like some hate-filled rant so I'm going to stop now. Trust me and DO NOT BUY this. Re-watching any episode from Batman: The Animated Series (Batman TAS) is better than seeing this for the first time.",1215561600,7,608,4.4375

What I got was several different animated episodes that were snapshots of events that helped shaped the Batman that we will see in the next movie.  Not that there isn't a fair amount of action - but I can see where the stories seem ""incomplete"".  It's because they are not meant to be tidy and complete but instead to show more of the psychology of the character.  Once you get your mind around that fact, you can potentially enjoy the episodes on the level I think they were intended.

Side Note:  When I see things like this I LONG for a good ANIMATED PG-13 or R Batman movie.  There are some things that live action/CG just can't do like animation!",1215561600,9,763,4.607407407407408

3384079,4,B001614F0S,"Ever since I was 3 I have been a fan of Batman. I started with the Superfriends and the Adam West show all the way to the awesome worlds of Bruce Timm and Christopher Nolan. Now with the most anticipated film of 2008 on the way in 'The Dark Knight' Bruce Timm decided to join his world and Nolans' world with 'Batman: Gotham Knight' This film bridges 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' showing Batman's rise to legendary status as well as keeping an eye out of the other major characters, heroic and villanous.

This film does not bring the viewer the familiar Batman to the screen. It is something completly different that has never been done in the superhero media. Yes there have been many depictions of famous superheroes in the style of Manga and other anime styles, but in print never moving picture. I think that is why many people are giving this movie a very mixed review. The style of anime is a cut above the american traditional 2-D/3-D animation. The animation is original and stories make the characters much more complex. Sometimes the line drawn between good and evil or hero and villian is washed away due to dark heroes and villians with no intentions of mass genocide or world domination. The most familiar thing you see in this film is Kevin Conroy doing what he does best and eventhough it would have been cool to see Christian Bale in this role I was glad that Kevin returned.

I say this movie should be seen because it is so fresh and different. I always enjoy when people move a character out of his or her comfort zone. While this film isn't as good as Mask of the Phantasm or Return of the Joker (the other Bruce Timm Batman Movies), I thought it was well put together and I am eagerly awaiting the next Warner Premire film which is Wonder Woman.",1215561600,13,1776,4.478395061728395

Lots of flash back... big fight WITHOUT the costume, gadget time with Lucius, Batman facing off against regular thugs and (eventually) his comic book villains, reflection on his internal conflict, Alfred as moral compass and big final battle on a train.  HELLO!?!?!?

Obviously, Joker is the quintessential Batman villain, but Nolan and Ledger's brand new take on the character preclude them from featuring that villain.  This effort is firmly placed in the LIVE ACTION universe, and some fans expecting a BTAS feature might be disappointed.  However, I have always found the Dini style to be too juvenile for the Timm scripts and was pleased to see such a fully realized production.

Overall, this is an EXCELLENT disc.  Adult fans of Batman and anime will be well pleased.

P.S.  As an aside, others have alluded to the ""youthful"" appearance of Wayne in the ""Field Test"" segment.  He does look like a teenager, but that is simply the nature of that style.  The story is solid and offers strong insight into the nature of Batman's integrity and character.",1215561600,4,1255,4.890995260663507
3384081,4,B001614F0S,"Contrary to other reviews, I found the first episode ""Have I Got a Story For You"" to be the highlight of this omnibus project. The story and design offered some very interesting and unusual re-envisioning of the Batman character. The style was inventive and pushed the envelope artistically. The shorts that followed had great moments, amazing action, welcome return of familiar voice actors, but overall relied on attitude over story. I just didn't get pulled into the moments they chose to put us into. The style of the animation also became more predictable, though admittedly, looked very very cool. I would have loved to have seen deeper stories, with equal conflict and action, that spoke more of Batman's emotional character, rather than the somewhat cartoony man-committed-to-fight-crime, one-note approach. I really liked watching this and it's worth checking out if you are a Batman or animation fan. And I wish they'd keep going with more! As past reviews show, there is a little something for everyone in a project like this, and you may find that other segments speak to you as a viewer.",1215561600,7,1100,5.016393442622951
3384082,3,B001614F0S,"It is very true that this is nothing new. Batman being turned into the Animatrix is still Batman. I am a Batman fan, but I think I was expecting more. The first story should have been completely left out. It is about kids telling there stories of when they first saw the Batman,but each kid has a different version as to what he looked like. The coolest thing about this movie is the return of Kevin Conroy. The downer is that the stories don't get interesting until the third.

Overall, this is an optional buy. It doesn't have anything to do with the upcoming movie, even though it is from the makers of the two Bale movies. If there is a connection, I didn't see it. They never reference Batman Begins, unless you count the Scarecrow on one story. I am a fan of Bruce Timm and what he has done with the DC animated universe, it is just a shame it didn't shine like most of his other work. On it's own, it's okay. If you are a major Batman fan, you will probably love it. If you are a casual or new fan wanting to like Batman, it being anime won't change your mind.",1215561600,4,1067,4.179611650485437

3384084,4,B001614F0S,"I will start off by saying it was one of the best animated Batman movies/series I have seen. The animation is what you would expect from anime the stereotypical anime animation but it was still good solid animation, which is a compliment from me because I really don't like anime.

 The first story was by far my least favorite. I thought it was kind of boring, it was the usual story of kids exagerating the truth. I don't want to really give the plot of anything away so I will avoid plot details. After watching the first one I was questioning if the movie was worth the money.

 After watching the second one I knew it was. The second cartoon was my favorite it had a good story, what I thought was the best animation out of them all and a good amount of action.

I'm not going to go through all six episodes because there isn't a lot to say other then plot details, but all around it was a really good set of short films on one of comics most iconic figures. I haven't really had a chance to go through the special features but on the two disc there is four episodes from one of the animated series (which for me was the selling point for the two disc). It was suposed to sum up what was going on between Batman Begins and Dark Knight, it doesn't tie the two together at all but it gives the viewer a better understanding of the crime and corruption going on in Gotham city. Again I think if you are a really big Batman fan whether it be the movies, comics/graphic novels, or the series I recomend this movie.",1215561600,10,1514,4.224913494809688

I was excited to see this new take on the Batman character but once I realized about ten minutes in that it wasn't going to get any better I lost interest quickly. Bleh. From the first story you are aware that'll probably put you to sleep. I can just imagine the pitch meeting. We'll make Batman hip for today's youth! Get skateboards and have kids talkin' ""street jive"" tellin' their Batman stories. Uggg. It's pretty bad. Save your money. We'll all lose interest as soon as the new movie comes out.

3384086,4,B001614F0S,"I am surprised at so many one star reviews.  I really do not know what to make of it, because at any level, this DVD is not that poor in writing or quality; however, I was both satisfied and in places a little disappointed.  The main film involves six stories woven into one narrative that last about hour and ten minutes.  The art work is generally good, but Batman is often drawn in an oft-kilted style.  So first, the disappointments: Now, I am just an amateur artists, but this style only works in short spurts (like one frame), not in multiple frames (where it starts to wear thin very quickly).  In one frame, it can draw the on-looker in, making one appreciate characteristics and points being made; however, in a film, this technique, I assert, begins to distract the viewer.

The stories are in and of themselves, pretty good; but, because they are small vignettes, they are not as good as the ""Animated Series"" from the early to mid 90s.  The story ""Working Through Pain"" is so esoteric, that its strength fails to deliver with its pretentious ending.  With that said, the rest of the DVD is very good and the stories hold up very well and while some stories involve a lot of action, some do not and this adds depth to the character - much like the comic book.  The best story is the last and that is true because it is also well told and the best ""drawn"".

The bio-epic on Bob Kane on disc two is really nice and one gets a good sense about the man and his life and journey.  There are some special ""animated"" series episodes and ""The Legends of the Dark Knight"" is similar to the first story on disk one, ""Do I have a Story to Tell"" (both of which are based loosely on ""The Batman Nobody Knows"" -Batman #250, 1973, Frank Robbins).

So when I found out there was going to be an Animatrix style in-betweener for Batman, I flipped....That is until I saw it.  Truthfully, this really isn't that good.  The animation is phenomenal - very dark, how Batman should be - but the stories just aren't good.  They go from bad to slightly better, but still never reach ""good"" by the end of the movie.  I found myself saying ""what was the point of that?"" at the end of every story, and couldn't really find any good reasons why this was even made.  This is pretty much a cash grab from the studios.  In comparison to The Animatrix, this one doesn't even stand up - Gotham Knight doesn't give you anything substantial - it doesn't deliver anything about the character that we don't already know, and it doesn't even reiterate the point very well.  There is really no need to see this before you see The Dark Knight.  I read earlier bad reviews and ignored them and bought it anyway - so PLEASE at least give this one a rental before you drop more than 20 bucks on it.",1215475200,8,1109,4.334951456310679

The story is loose, not all that together.  The 6 interlocking stories makes no sense at all.  Batman's suit looks more closely like the Azrael Batman.  Most of the drawing are too Akira like.  And, that is not a good thing actually.

They need not have bothered. This DVD is pure slop. The opening art is so horrific, that a five-year-old could have done it. It appears to have been done by the same person who brought us ""Batman: The Long Halloween."" Now, I could be wrong as THAT art made me what to retch and I wasn't interested in finding out anything about it. I can't possible figure out why DC would give that guy another project. (Oh, wait. Of course, he's nouveau; he's fresh; he's cutting edge! My gosh we should all bow to the triumph of his artistic achievement.) Yeah, and the emperor's new cloths had every one gasping and praising the designers, too. Face it, folks: the only lead in to ""The Dark Knight"" is how DC was able to con the public into thinking something of value was being released and get us to cough up $20-plus and THEN we realize, the joke's on us.

3384091,4,B001614F0S,"With The Dark Knight just around the corner, Warner Bros. and DC has released another more than solid, direct to DVD animated feature with Batman: Gotham Knight.  A collection of six interlocking stories featuring various writing and animator talent, Gotham Knight gets off to a bit of a rocky start, but winds up being a thoroughly entertaining ride while it lasts.  ""Have I Got a Story For You"", with a script from A History of Violence screenwriter Josh Olson, revolves around a group of kids and their stories about encountering Batman in action.  The story and animation here aren't really anything special, but thankfully things get better from here on forward.  ""Crossfire"", with a script from acclaimed comic writer Greg Rucka, finds detectives Allen and Ramirez caught in the middle of a gang-war between mob factions, with Batman in the middle as well.  ""Field Test"", with a script from Jordan Goldberg, features a ridiculously young Bruce Wayne putting new gadgets from Lucius Fox to use, while Batman Begins and Blade writer David Goyer contributes the excellent ""In Darkness Dwells"", where Batman takes on the Scarecrow and Killer Croc.  Comic writer Brian Azzarello contributes ""Working Through Pain"", which is an intriguing look at Bruce's past lessons to overcome physical pain, and the excellent finale entitled ""Deadshot"" is written by classic animated series writer Alan Burnett and features a bloody face-off between Batman and the gun-toting assassin of the title name.  The various animation techniques used throughout may not be everyone's cup of tea (some will certainly thrill you more than others), but as a whole Gotham Knight is a dark (and surprisingly violent) blast.  The Two-Disc Special Edition features some spectacular extras that are worth the price of admission alone, including a fascinating documentary going over Batman's rogues gallery, a documentary about Batman creator Bob Kane, and four great episodes from the classic 90's animated series.  All in all, Batman: Gotham Knight will tide you over (briefly) during the wait for The Dark Knight, and Batman fans should definitely give it a look.  Be warned however if you're a parent: Gotham Knight is a surprisingly mature and violent animated feature that more than likely should not be viewed by young children.",1215475200,26,2305,5.205405405405405

3384094,3,B001614F0S,"wow, very dissapointing but its still ok.
The animation was beautiful but most of the stories were dull and boring for the exception of a couple or so and i love Batman.

the first story with the little kids was ok but it just wasn't "" Batman"" to me, I felt like i was watching PBS or something. The animation or art was nice looking but the story was ok. my rating: 3/5

the second story was alright but the first few minutes were dull and boring, i thought the two detectives were boring charcters.but then i saw batman at the end and that was probably the best part.but in the end, it wasn't very good, and lets keep in mind these stories are about 12 min or so, my rating for this 3/5

the third one was much better than the first 2, although parts of it were dull, the scenes with batman were really cool, the action was cool but i wish i could of seen more of Batman. this story was good but dissapointing. I liked the design of batman on this one.
my rating 3.5/5

the 4th story was also pretty descent , batman looked cool in this story. I didn't like how killer croc and scarecrow looked and how they were used in this story but its was still descent, but the story is just way too short. my rating 3.5/5

the fifth story sucked big time balls, it was very dull and boring .it wasn't a very good story at all, it wasn't entertaining. I didn't like it at all, the only good parts were the scenes with batman. my rating 1.5/5

the 6th and last story was the best and it was very cool. in this one batman must face an assasin named deadshot. Batman's design looks very cool in this story and i think its the best design. deadshot is a very cool villain. the action scenes were cool. this was well written but my only complain is that it was just way too short. This is is what the entire ""movie"" should of been like. It would of been awesome to see deadshot vs batman more than once. It would of been much better had their been a bigger plot and a bigger story instead of having six stories. the 6th story gets a rating of 4.5/5

the entire 70 minute or so movie should of been the sixth story They should of taken the 6th story and expand it to 70 minutes. That way we could of had a very cool Batman anime film. 12 min was not enough. this idea of six stories by six different people was sort of a good idea but it just didn't work out right.bad excecution.

i'll probably wait until this dvd gets cheaper and buy the two disc dvd, which comes with 4 episodes from Batman The Animated Series, now thats the type of story telling that this film was missing.

overall 3/5 stars",1215302400,7,2583,4.139720558882235
3384095,5,B001614F0S,"To be frank I only liked the second half of the film. The first half constists of nothing but the view of Batman through the eyes of various civilians, and Batman beating up goons.

The second half or the last two stories are far more enjoyable. Working Through Pain was written by one of my favourite comic book writers Brian Azarello (100 Bullets), and he did a good job in annunciating that Bruce really doesn't want to work through the pain of his parents death. He wants to hold on to that pain because it gives him purpose and it drives him. And really if he were to give up that pain--he probably would find his life devoid and meaningless and purposeless. The Deadshot story, I liked because it shows the kind of Alpha male hero who is willing to stand down any threat (yet not a goon) warrior I like to see him portrayed as.",1214870400,16,833,4.339743589743589
3384096,1,B001614F0S,"I had pre-ordered this DVD Saturday, July 28th and that night I went to a free screening for Batman: Gotham Knight in Wizard World Chicago.

Tonight I removed it from my Amazon orders. Batman: Gotham Knight does not live up to the hype. Producer Bruce Timm and company have delivered a 6-part turkey.

As each of the 6 stories in this animated movie played out I expected the stories to get better and better. Sadly, instead they got less and less terrible. Believe me, there is a difference.

Not even Greg Rucka, a man who wrote classic Batman crime stories a few years back, could deliver on a project that sorely needed some substance. The closet thing to a sucess was the story written by 100 Bullets scribe Brian Azzarello in which Batman flashes back to his pain endurance training as a young Bruce Wayne.

However the worst crime in the 6-chapter feature was committed by writer Josh Olsen's ""Have I Got a Story for You"". In this tale a few young children each tell exaggerated stories about who Batman really is. Sound familiar? Well it should because producer Bruce Timm has produced the exact same story before in the 90's for Batman: The Animated series with the episode: Legends of the Dark Knight--a piece of animation much more lively than this bland throwaway tale Mr. Olsen has the gall to submit us to! To add insult to the viewer's injury, the Legends of the Dark Knight episode was based on a Batman story from the 70's Batman comics, ""The Batman Nobody Knows"" by Frank Robbin and Dick Giordano (reprinted in The Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told). And that story too was also a better executed tale. Shame on you Josh Olsen.

Avoid this DVD altogether or wait for it to end up as a bargin on Amazon market place. I have a feeling that it will be dirt cheap to get by Christmas.",1214784000,4,1798,4.537037037037037
3384097,5,B001614F0S,"*This does contain some minor spoilers. I tried not to spoil too much.*

Batman: Gotham Knight is advertised as the missing link between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. There are six stories in total. Each story is by different artists, but they all link together and flow together nicely.

The first story is called, ""Have I got a story for you,"" and involves a boy waiting for his friends to arrive. Once they do, each one of them tells a story about what they saw today and they all saw Batman. Each story is farfetched in its own way as this story capitalizes on teenagers stretching the truth and/or having overactive imaginations. It seems their day isn't finished though as the fight they all witnessed makes its way to that very skate park.

""Crossfire"" is the story of Chris and Anna being apart of Lieutenant Gordon's MCU (Major Crime Unit). Chris thinks Batman is a vigilante that takes the law into his own hands while Anna is still unsure about him and is just thankful that good cops that know how to do their job are actually being respected now that Batman has shown up. After taking a recent Arkham escapee back to the asylum, they soon realize they're stuck in the middle of a gang war between Sal Maroni and The Russian.

""Field Test"" begins with Lucius Fox showing Bruce Wayne some new gadgets. Amongst them is a harness equipped with an electromagnetic pulse strong enough to deflect bullets. Batman decides to test it out with Maroni, The Russian, and his goons. Everything is going Batman's way until a certain...glitch...happens.

""In Darkness Dwells"" has everyone looking for a monster. Killer Croc, to be exact. Apparently, he was the former patient of a certain Johnathan Crane. Coincidentally, one of the reasons he was admitted to Dr. Crane was for his fear of bats. Go figure.

Batman is injured on what seems like any other night he puts on his mask in ""Working Through Pain."" We're basically shown how tenacious he really is as he struggles with his injuries. We're also shown a few flashbacks of his past and soon learn the difference between exterior and interior pain. There's a way to put pain in its place and this is how Bruce Wayne found out how.

""Deadshot"" has come back to Gotham and has set his sights on Jim Gordon, but it looks like he has ulterior motives. Bruce Wayne also gives his views on guns.

Gotham Knight is superb. There's really no other way to describe it. I had my doubts about it, but I think those were blown away during the first few minutes of the film. The animation is fantastic. Everything moves crisply and smoothly. It just seems to flow. And let me just say that it's amazing to hear Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman again. It's like a homecoming in so many ways.

The biggest question you may be asking yourself is how can all the stories actually flow together since they're all done by different artists. The truth is that other than the artistic style changing, you don't really notice anything. The voice cast stays the same throughout the entire film and while each individual story has its own story to tell, they're all connected in some way and flow together nicely.

Gotham Knight is a feature that shouldn't be missed by anybody. Whether you're an anime fan, a Batman fan, or you're just looking for something new to catch your eye, I'd recommend Gotham Knight to anyone and everyone. The animation is beautiful and has a real crisp flow to it while the stories are written incredibly well and will keep you interested. The voice cast is also something worth mentioning. Other than seeing Kevin Conroy come back as Batman, the rest of the cast does a great job as well. My one complaint is that it doesn't really bridge the gap between anything. However, it doesn't really seem to bridge the gap between anything and is just an excellent stand alone animated feature.",1214784000,71,3853,4.636363636363637

Written by the team that gave us the Batman Animated series, the animation in this show is done in the style of Japanese Manga cartoons. It follows the events of Batman Begins, where the Dark Knights crusade against crime is producing results. Batman faces off against Scarecrow, Killer Croc and Deadshot in six interconnected stories.

Don't let the fact that this was done by the animation team fool you, however. Like the recent ""Superman: Doomsday"", they have a much heavier theme in character and story.

A major bonus. Kevin Conroy reprises his role as the voice of Batman/Bruce Wayne. I've always felt that is what Batman should sound like, and Conroy's interpretation is better than any live actor whose ever portrayed him. Then again, I've always felt animation is a better medium than live action for any superhero story.

There is a drawback that Bruce Wayne has the spiky hair of an anime character, which was just slightly off-putting. It's a very minor quibble, however.",1520985600,2,1063,4.921787709497207

Great buy for any batman fan!",1512259200,,402,4.728571428571429
8260633,1,B001614F0S,"I see what they were trying to do here, but it was honestly painful to watch the movie in its entirety. I'm a huge Batman fan and typically enjoy almost all Batman related things, but this just did NOT do it for me.

Cons:
-The animation is all over the place and inconsistent
-Many of the stories lacked the sort of substance that attracts me to Batman, such as the detective aspect",1507939200,,383,4.319444444444445
