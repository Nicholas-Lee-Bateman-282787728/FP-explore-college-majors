8077460,3,B000AANYT4,"Was disappointed because I was expecting a horror movie which the trailer leads to believe it is.  At first it seems that this is a Columbuo (Peter Falk)  style mystery but, it  more complex than that.  Christopher Lee does his usual excellent job but, he under a mask so you don't get to see him.  The movie can be dull in spots but, it keeps interest as the mystery unravels.  Early in the film there is an brief comic trapeze act which is something I haven't see before.",1506816000,,473,4.318181818181818

8077462,4,B000AANYT4,"This was really quite a good murder mystery. It's not too violent by today's standards. It was paced well, had an interesting plot, and the acting was believable. There are spots of comedy throughout. While the movie is a bit campy, it's also set in a circus, so it fits the overall atmosphere. The very end was a small but brilliant touch. If you like murder mysteries, this is worth a watch.",1477785600,2,393,4.472222222222222
