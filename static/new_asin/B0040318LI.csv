4237763,5,B0040318LI,"Let me firstly say that this anime for what it was, was quite good. I especially liked how midway through, large changes were made. First of all I'd classify this kind of anime somewhat in the Guyver/Witchblade category. There is a fair amount of gore. Lots of fast action for one and characters I grew quite attached to, which doesn't happen often for me since animes like Gantz for example really slap you in the face with mass character killing. Not to mention the blend of CG and standard anime style was very adjustable. The story came right to point, there are monsters that kill people and a task force is used to stop them. It gets a bit complicated  with monsters coming from infected dead bodies and later infecting the living as well. These monsters go on killing sprees to infect or destroy people, they can also meld their bodies to other devices such as cars and such to repair themselves. The interesting part occurs when the task force finds that one or two of these monsters are killing their own kind. I won't go too much in detail since that would ruin too much and be very boring to boot. Trust me on this though, each character involved in this anime gets their shining moment, be it sad or happy it's up to you to find out. I have to say it started getting really good when this mid point of the story occurred, and the playing field became a much bigger ball game you might say. Over all I feel this anime deserves a solid 5 because, it took the time given to bring up some very wonderful characters and provide a very sad but interesting story that doesn't just punch you in the face outright.",1291248000,14,1617,4.408026755852843

4237765,3,B0040318LI,"good anima /annoying commercials!!!!!!
basically what I mean by commercials is before you can watch the anima you have to watch one add for another anima and you cannot click out of it to the menu.  that goes for all the CD's",1405987200,,225,4.357142857142857
4237766,3,B0040318LI,For what it is its a decent anime. The action at times just becomes the same as the other fight scenes one warrior against a horde and with swing of his weapon clears out the enemy.,1399593600,,181,4.055555555555555
4237767,3,B0040318LI,It was good in the beginning then started to get strange I really wasn't sure how I felt in the end,1399420800,,99,3.761904761904762
4237768,5,B0040318LI,"I first saw this series on Netflix and just had to get this dvd set. I've been a huge Anime fan for many years. I mostly enjoy the series that emotionaly move me with the deeper parts of the story line. It's a heavy Mech and tech future police and revolting mech infecting humans type of storyline with a deep storyline that really makes you get involved with the personal back stories of the different chars.
Lots of action from the very beginning. If you like this sort of Anime you can't go wrong with this set.",1397088000,,514,4.309278350515464
4237769,5,B0040318LI,"These anime shows are awesome to watch. If you love a good anime series, then this is a show for you. This show will blow your mind.",1393545600,,132,3.925925925925926
4237770,5,B0040318LI,It is an amazing series for any Anime fans and even just the everyday person. I have wanted this for a while now but am on a tight budget so when it came to S.A.V.E. i was so happy. Normally im the kind of person who has to have the fancy box and cover but dealing with budgets you learn to live without those kinds of things. I have bought many of the S.A.V.E. editions and it has saved me tons of money while still getting the Anime that i love!,1389657600,2,447,3.923076923076923
4237771,4,B0040318LI,"At First I thought this anime was boring. But if you continue to watch it, it's pretty good. I like the story of it. The ending was unforgettable. I got bumped out that it finished. So that means it was good. I recommend it :) It has a slip cover & artwork is good.",1386201600,2,265,3.925925925925926
4237772,4,B0040318LI,It was good did not like how it ended tho that's why I gave it a four star rating but it is something for ur collection,1370390400,,119,3.6153846153846154
4237773,5,B0040318LI,"Great story, graphics and characters. Definitely get your moneys worth. Story touches human strengths and weaknesses. Some what graphic deaths and adult scenes. A must buy.",1369008000,,172,5.653846153846154
4237774,5,B0040318LI,"Yes, this anime has a bit of a morbid tone to it. But, also at the same time the story is told around the characters so that you get to know them pretty good and feel for them as their stories develop. The artwork is nice although it took me an episode or two to get used to a few of the CG elements, but that is minor. The pacing of the fight scenes and the artwork therein is great. You can tell quite a bit of budget went into the fights especially toward the climax of the series. If you watch a lot of anime you will recognize many of the character archetypes, but they really work for this story and I didn't mind. In fact with the dark tone the familiar archetypes kept the series grounded (for me anyways). In the end it wraps up with what I thought was a proper ending that left me satisfied with my viewing experience. I'm glad this one is in my collection.",1361923200,5,867,4.076023391812866
4237775,3,B0040318LI,The anime was not what I was expecting... But everything was in order and I got the disks and everything on time. I only wish I liked the anime xD,1353888000,,146,3.9
4237776,5,B0040318LI,"This is a very tragic anime, but it's also really entertaining. It's about a plague that turns the citizens of Germany into demons. These demons have the ability to merge with machines. This makes them extremely deadly. The main protagonist is also infected with this disease. Unlike most of the other victims he retains his personality and free will. He fights to eliminate the threat and kill the murderous jerk with god complex that is behind it all.

I don't know whats up with all these negative reviews about Blassreiter, but I think it's great. The story is very involved, and the characters are likable. The animation is top notch and the soundtrack is perfect for it. The action in this one gets really intense too. If the sourpusses that slammed this series spooked you then rent it or watch it on youtube. Either way definitely give it a chance.",1349913600,14,856,4.706666666666667
4237777,3,B0040318LI,I didn't mind this series but I prefer my tv series to have a bit more comedy ans some of these can be a bit too dark,1346889600,,117,3.3703703703703702
4237778,5,B0040318LI,"i love this series so far only through the 3rd disk but its good so far. Action is great, story line is clear and precise, and twists you wouldn't see coming.i hated the last episode of disk 2 though because of how depressing it is but looking forward to the rest of the series. Season 2 anybody? hahaha",1338076800,4,303,4.241379310344827
4237779,1,B0040318LI,"To all anime fans, do not waste your time watching this series.  I watched it when it was streamed on crunchyroll and thank God because it prevented me from wasting $30 on this mess.  There are more problems with these series then I could possibly name but the big one is definitely lack of focus on everything.  Although there is one main protagonist, the story stumbles through about 2 or 3 others with no idea who the star is.  On top of that, the antagonist is your typical ""humanity is evil and needs to be destroyed"" type, utterly predictable.  Like I said, do not waste your time on this series.",1336694400,3,602,4.4363636363636365
4237780,5,B0040318LI,"I will start by saying this is a very Dark sci-fi Anime I strongly think is was done very well The animation was done in away that just about takes your breath away.  The Action is very Violent and very Enjoyable yes there is some blood/gore and yes there is some ""Fan Service"" but all that plays well into the series if your like me you may get confused in the first two to three episodes as to who the Protagonist is but as the series moves it dose go deep into each of the main Hero's story and back story and ties them all together for a showdown in the end that is rather shocking.

I do strongly recommend this to all Action Anime and Sci-fi Anime fans you won't be disappointed.",1334880000,2,685,4.142857142857143
4237781,5,B0040318LI,"Highly suggest getting this DVD set. It does require you to stay with it as it gets a bit depressing at times. The ending is well worth watching it all the way thru. I won't spoil the series with infor into the plot etc. , but who you think the main hero is might fool you. Enjoy!",1332720000,3,280,3.9298245614035086
4237782,5,B0040318LI,"Due to its complexity, Blassreiter is not an easy series to watch.  You have to be very sharply focused on the unfolding drama in order to understand the story. Good guys become bad guys, and bad guys become good guys very quickly during the course of the episodes and the explanations are subtle for these changes. The line between good and evil become blurred, but if you stay focused and follow the story carefully it's very entertaining and fascinating conceptually.  This series contains one of the best combinations of computer generated animation and sophisticated hand-drawn animation that I've seen in quite a while. The basic concept is that attacks by dangerous powerful beings known as Amalgams are causing destruction and death as they invade cities and towns.  Amalgams are genetically enhanced human beings who have been forced into an advanced evolutionary stage by artificial means. Normally, Amalgam is a word that defines a mixture of metal alloys tempered with mercury in such a way as to make it liquid or solid according to external temperature. This is fitting, since in the series Amalgams can change between their advanced form, and thier normal human form when the situations become hot or cold..., so to speak.  Eventually it becomes clear that there are different types of Amalgams. There are good and bad, those who want to reshape the world according to their own rules, and those who want to save and preserve the world to follow its own destiny.  As the series progresses the complexity of the characters develops and the series grows dramatically.  I recommend this series, but you do have to be attentive to the rapidly changing plot or you may find yourself confused quickly.  The disks performed perfectly, the color , the sound, the video quality was all excellent.

4237783,3,B0040318LI,"To begin with, after an expectation lowering opening episode, I thought Blassreiter had the potential to be something special. The first half was lacking in terms of main plot details (basically, it came down to an evil scientist lady handing out happy pills to the despairing), and Joseph - the supposed lead - remained secondary to other characters throughout the entire show, but these 'flaws' actually did a lot good for the show. During episodes 1-12, three subplots got covered, and caring about the characters involved so much as the events linked together to form a web of misery made it easy for me to forget there had been no explanations about the evolution from man to machine-person. And the slaughtering in episode 12 was the icing on a very tasty cake.

Sadly, right after that, it all went wrong. Horribly wrong. Joseph's history with Xargin - the main villain of the piece - got explained as follows: Joseph lived in a modern German town where the rich are allowed to abuse the poor as much as they desire. In Blassreiter's Germany, the poor are fire-bombed in a church after flooding, and scholarship students researching a method for the poor to survive using nanomachines (...) are beaten to death/probably raped simply because they come from poor backgrounds. Xargin helped the poor; Joseph was poor.

Like Blassreiter's story in general, the back-story was horribly written. Xargin went from an overly helpful nice guy to fire-wielding God-speaker within minutes (with a horse, 'cause the whole 'Horseman of the Apocalypse' thing needed illustrating), and Joseph was randomly given a bike by the evil director of the nanomachine project which, of course, WASN'T REALLY INTENDED TO HELP THE WEAK AND WAS MEANT TO TURN MAN INTO MACHINE. ""Go chase after the now clearly evil Xargin, using this hi-tech bike I pulled out of my arsehole!""

Following the flashbacking, out of nowhere it was revealed that Blassreiter's Germany is run from the shadows by Zwolf: a religious organization with its own military. The dead were revived to battle anew as Zwolf's triple, Power Ranger mechas entered the fray. Joseph continued being useless all the way to end as the revived dead continued to try to settle outdated issues. The under-developed characters got a few minutes dedicated to their pasts (in one, a horse was killed because old men don't like girls caring about horses, or something.) And, finally, everything ended with a terrible end duel to the death.

You know how, in your typically horrible anime ending, spirits give a show's lead some vocal support in his head, during his moment of need? Well, in Blassreiter, since its lead sucks so much arse even at the very end, he got owned within five seconds and needed DEAD PEOPLE to enter his body to fight for him. Then, after they lost, Joseph himself resumed the good fight, somehow getting an 'OVER 9000!' power-up... and got owned AGAIN; this time after telling Xargin he had no chance against his 'OVER 9000!' self.

.....

Without wanting to ramble any further, I'll put it simply: Blassreiter got worse the further it went after the halfway point. How well the struggles of the 'subplot leads' were presented made me think of 9/10ing it. But then it became obvious that the plot hadn't been planned out, the dead kept coming back to life, and it ended fittingly poorly with a character actually saying ""Let's keep fighting the good fight!"", followed by the dead all reappearing... or something.

On a happier end note, the CG looked extremely attractive throughout - blending with the 2D animation superbly. I wasn't taken with it at first, truth be told, but that was more to do with me starting an anime TV series and getting non-step CG shoved down my throat from the get-go. My only complaint is how zoomed-in and frantic some of the battles were; them giving off a hand-held camera impression and making it hard to tell what was happening.

My advice is as follows: buy the first half of Blassreiter, watch it, and convince yourself it ends with episode 12. Much like with Code Geass, it's MUCH more satisfying to live in blissful ignorance; unaware the writers were actually clueless tosspots in need of shooting. Repeatedly.",1291939200,10,4209,4.88515406162465
