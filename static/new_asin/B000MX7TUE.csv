Salieri's 'The return of Europe') Luca's mad scene does not need such stairs...",1495843200,,158,4.888888888888889
8173421,4,B000MX7TUE,"There are certain operas, gentle reader, where DVDs of multiple performances sneak onto our DVD shelves; such operas as Traviata, Norma, Elisir, Fille du Regiment ... and, of course, Lucia are in that category. This disc contains a very fine performance with many strengths and some weaknesses, as will be explained in more detail. But at the outset, be aware that this is regional Italian opera, so if the glitz of the ""big houses"" like the Met, the ROH or La Scala are your metier, pass on. Regional opera in Italy is a matter of passinate dedication to composers as evidenced by Verdi in Parma, Rossini in Pesaro and Donizetti in his home town, Bergamo, where this Lucia is staged. It usually means opera on small stages with limited budgets, reflected in sets and costumes that are less than what one expects from the big houses.

The strengths of this performance lie in the singers, all of whom do wonderfully well with their roles. My only previous experience with Mme. Rancatore was as Olympia in a now deleted Hoffman (TDK). Here she does an exceptional job as Lucia. Mind you, my definitive Lucia was and remains Joan Sutherland, for whom I stood to see perform the role in the mid 1960s, but Rancatore is definitely in the major leagues with this performance. So is Roberto Di Biasio as Edgardo. He has several DVD operas to his credit (Maria Stuarda, Lucrezia Borgia and I Due Foscari come to mind)so I am familiar with him: he is a major talent, with the audience in Bergamo giving him a more rousing applause than Mme Rancatore. Luca Grassi (Enrico) is a wonderful baritone with a big, rich sound and an extended top which he uses generously. Bass Enrico Giuseppe lori is also a gifted singer with a big, rich sound. Acting overall is fair to good.

The weaknesses here include sets and staging. Charitably put, sets are ""minimalist"": they ain't much of them. Staging is what I expect of regional opera: chorus members are locals who generally line up and kick out the notes. By and large, that's what happens here; there's little interaction between choristers such as one sees with the splendid Met Chorus, but I am nitpicking here.

Disc quality is mostly good, with some apparent washout of color on occasion. Sound is good to excellent. Subtitles abound and the menu is easy to navigate. The performance is complete, except for the chorus which concludes the ""mad scene"", with repeats as written and, of course, the Wolf's Crag tenor baritone duet is here, splendidly sung.

I could not end this without noting the comments of some of my reviewer colleagues about the snow. Gentle reader, I live in the northern tip of Michigan's lower penninsula where average annual snowfall is 160"". I didn't notice much snow at all in this performance and what there was was not off putting for me.

In sum, this is a dandy performance of an opera we love and it will get many playings here. If you can only have one Lucia, get the one with Sutherland. On the other hand, why not spoil yourselves with one or two more? As Star Trek's Dr. McCoy once noted,""Jim, it's all good!""",1364428800,,3082,4.668508287292818
8173422,4,B000MX7TUE,"This is a DVD of a live performance at the Bergamo Donizetti Music Festival, 2006. Whether this opera is new to you or an old friend, you ought to enjoy this rendering.

These singers were all new to me. I enjoyed all the singing, especially in the ensembles. The title role is sung by a huge-voiced Desiree Rancatore; now and again her vibrato threatened intonation, and her occasional ""non vibrato"" made me wish she used it a bit more often. However, for all the massive spinto color and force of her voice, she is nimble in bel canto figuration and offers a vocally pleasing and dramatically persuasive performace. Alisa (Tiziana Falco) and all the male soloists were more than equal to the parts, especially Roberto De Biasio (Edgardo), Luca Grassi (Enrico), Enrico Giuseppe Iori (Raimondo), and Matteo Barca as a chilling Arturo.

The staging is somber and Scottish in a classic vein -- except for a surreal backdropped hand-written document in one set. Lighting and visual quality are outstanding, and the orchestra under the baton of Antonino Fogliani handles the score and accompaniment with panache.

My fail-safe measuring stick for an overall rating: Do I wish I'd attended this performance, and how would it have rated if I had been there? I'm very comfortable with four stars.",1269043200,3,1289,4.9308755760368665
8173423,3,B000MX7TUE,"First, let's address some of the things you may NOT like about this production of Lucia.
Bearing in mind that this was likely not a high budget production (""Bergamo Musica Festival Gaetano Donizetti""), not much of an investment was made in scenery:  a bare tree, some chairs, and a rather steep white staircase that later doubles as Edgardo's family tomb.

Likewise, costumes are rather bland, except for those of Lucia and her chaperone, Alisa.  The only thing in abundance in this staging is SNOW!  Yes, light to heavy ubiquitous snowfall begins, especially whenever mention is made of death or hopelessness.  Lucia (Desiree Rancatore) even tries to start a snowball fight, but her friend Alisa will have none of it, so after the third snowball thrown, Lucia tosses aside the fourth.  (More snowfall later)

Another thing missing is blood and daggers.  Perhaps some would argue they are not essentials, but when many of us watch Lucia's ""mad scene,"" we expect to see her with the bloody dagger and at least a few smears of blood on her bridal gown.  Another mystery is why they insisted that Lucia wear a red gown with a twenty to thirty foot train.  The only explanation I have been able to come up with is that as she descends that rather steep white staircase, the other end of the train may be secured off-stage, allowing it to act as a sort of safety harness in case Lucia falls.

So, what about the music?  The orchestra sounds pretty good, aside from a brief moment during the scene where Lucia is resigning herself to the marriage.  Intruding upon her aria is a sound from the orchestra that can best be compared to an automobile horn.  The singing by all the principals is good, with moments of great inspiration.  In the first part of the opera, Lucia has some uncertainties in her lower register, a few notes of questionable pitch, and several ""almost shrieks.""  In fairness, she settles down and sings all her major arias very well.

Edgardo (Roberto De Biasio), like Lucia, has several weak moments as acting goes, but his voice is sweet, clear, and passionate.  Apparently, he is also the local favorite, demonstrated by repeated ovations from the audience after his arias and after the finale.  Frequently, it reminds me of opera productions of a century ago, where audiences paid attention only during the favorite arias.

So, after the several shortcomings I've mentioned, what are some reasons why you might still find this production enjoyable?  First and foremost is that many of us simply cannot get enough of the beautiful operatic work, Lucia.  Though some productions are not as successful as others, they are like our children, and we love all of them.  After the first third of the opera, the singers and orchestra settle down, making for an enjoyable evening of Lucia. Also, despite the limited budget considerations, they did not ""cheap out"" on the music.  If my ears do not deceive me, they used a real glass harmonica, or ""armonica,"" as Benjamin Franklin called his variation.  Instead of relying only on woodwinds, the glass harmonica provides the ""mad scene"" with  ethereal, ghostly tones that add a haunting flavor to the scene.

Oh, and more about the SNOW.  As the string instruments begin their most beautiful melody--the lament as Edgardo stabs himself so that he can join Lucia in Heaven, Lucia is seen lying on the stage behind him.  Of course, it starts snowing again--but this time it's endless pink-red rose petals falling by her lifeless body.",1263945600,,3488,4.844594594594595
8173424,2,B000MX7TUE,"My problem is this - every time I begin to sing in this production, it snows!  Is this normal?
But seriously folks this budget production of LUCIA from the Bergamo Music Festival is so sparse and scenery-less they had to thrown in some kind of special effects and the director chose snow.  It snows during Lucia's opening aria which prompts her to bend over and make a snow ball which she throws at her attendant Alisa.  When Edgardo joins Lucia for their big act one duet, it snows even harder.  The scene consists of a tree without leaves and a bench.  The few pieces of furniture in the rest of the production looks like it was purchased from IKEA.  If the cast consisted of big voiced Donizetti style singers it wouldn't make a difference but the cast is young and their singing goes from ""pretty darn good"" to ""sorry you missed that note!""  Desiree Rancatore as Lucia does a ""pretty darn good"" job with the mad scene even though she's required to drag a red cape the length of a football field around the stage as she trills. Roberto de Biasio has the voice of Edgardo in his vocal cords but he's just not quite secure about it.  Luca Grassi as Enrico is more in the ""sorry you missed that note"" category.  I really didn't need another DVD of Lucia.  This version is more along the lines and quality of our Minnesota Opera Company productions.  It never takes off and flies but boy can we Minnesotans relate to all that snow!  Makes the third act of LA BOHEME look like scattered flurries.",1230681600,9,1494,4.452205882352941
