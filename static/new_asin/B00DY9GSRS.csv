5878300,5,B00DY9GSRS,This is one of my biggest acquisitions because i bought it in a very low price and the series is so captive that i couldn't stop watching it until finish the second season. Now I must buy the third one to continue the story.,1381190400,,224,4.113636363636363

5878306,5,B00DY9GSRS,"If you've seen ""Boardwalk Empire"" but don't yet own the blu-ray, then this bundle of Seasons 1 & 2 is perfect.  If you've never seen the show, I'd encourage you to give it a chance.  Everything about this series is spectacular - the acting, the camera work, the production design, etc.  This is one of the best scripted shows currently on television, and the story is executed in near-perfect fashion thanks to the brilliant direction.  The show is best when viewed quickly over a short period of time, because you really get immersed in the world and follow the intricacies of the story - and blu-ray is the best way to do that.

In terms of the blu-ray quality, HBO has always been great about providing viewers with the best video/audio experience.  There are also a lot of special features on the discs, including featurettes and character dossiers.  The audio commentary tracks are quite interesting to listen to, the creators of the show (including directors, actors, etc) give their perspective on the story/characters and share anecdotes from the production.  The packaging is also quite nice - it's a fold-out digipak type case.  The DVD discs and Digital Copy code comes in a separate cardboard holder.  And everything comes inside a thick outer slip box.

* As I write this, this bundle is the Blu-Ray Deal of the Week for $55.99 - that's only $28 per season, which is a decent price for these sets.  The Season 3 blu-ray has also just been released, so this is the perfect time to catch up if you've never seen the show.",1376784000,17,1532,4.675373134328358

5878314,4,B00DY9GSRS,This was a pretty good. Getting all those seasons in blue-ray for that cheap was awesome. HBO really brings entertainment and they did the same here.,1402358400,,149,4.769230769230769
5878315,1,B00DY9GSRS,"We ordered the first season of Boardwalk Empire. Package arrived with a sticker that said It was the CDs, opened the bubble wrap to find a metal cake pan.",1402358400,,154,4.344827586206897

5878317,5,B00DY9GSRS,An unbelievably low price for the first three seasons of what will be an iconic series. This is up there with Breaking Bad and Walking Dead folks. See for yourself at a great price.,1395360000,,181,4.352941176470588
5878318,5,B00DY9GSRS,"Another review (currently the top one) sadly states this set is not HD. This is false. This is simply a UK (coded region free) release available here in the States. It will play perfectly fine in your US player and is in full HD 1080p. As of this review, it is under $70, and as such is a true bargain compared to buying these three seasons individually. The value comes from the fact that it does not contain extraneous DVDs or Digital Copies, only 15 Blu Rays. These discs are packed nicely in three separate blu ray cases designed to hold 5 discs each, one set for each season. And there is a cardboard slip case.

If you weren't sure, get this set with no worries.",1395273600,8,668,4.301587301587301
5878319,5,B00DY9GSRS,Great series.  It is the best since Spartacus ended.  It served the trick and made a friend a Nucky convert.  Can't wait for the next season.,1392681600,,141,4.346153846153846
5878320,5,B00DY9GSRS,this show is Sopranos meets Burn Notice with the drama and love stories for the ladies. Bought it for my husband and I watch it with him!,1390694400,,137,4.111111111111111
5878321,5,B00DY9GSRS,"What can you say about this series that everyone else hasn't already said.
The acting is great. The story line is from real events.
Love It",1389571200,,139,4.384615384615385
5878322,4,B00DY9GSRS,"I'm not sure if there were any problems,the set was for my mom,and she really seemed to like it. I would recommend the set to anyone.",1388793600,,133,4.153846153846154
5878323,5,B00DY9GSRS,Excellent series! for those of you who are interested and how this whole Liquor Came About In The 1920 This Is An Excellent Choice Easy To Follow Rated R for sure!,1388448000,,163,4.290322580645161
5878324,5,B00DY9GSRS,"What a show! Actions packed,great sub-plots,historically accurate,GREAT ACTING ALL AROUND!! Definitely one of those addicting shows, as I stayed up too many late nights watching these(my boss hated me)",1386720000,,201,5.9655172413793105
5878325,5,B00DY9GSRS,"Coming off the end of the Sopranos I was excited to see Steve Buscemi pop up in another series.  I am guilty of having high Sopranos expectations and this is a much different series.  This is very detailed, from scenery, advertising and language. This is a mob like series but also a sort of time machine to the 1920's. The characters are very well done, creating a great backbone for the show. Nucky Thompson is obviously the star but Capone, Chucky White and even the guy with the worst luck in the world Nelson really make this show work. Be patient with the show and you will be happy you did. Look forward to hopefully some more seasons to come.",1384473600,,650,4.408333333333333
5878326,3,B00DY9GSRS,"I believe these are a Canadian product. No real complaints, except the fact that it will only display in 720p. Being a video snob, this detracts from the overall experience.",1384300800,8,173,4.8
