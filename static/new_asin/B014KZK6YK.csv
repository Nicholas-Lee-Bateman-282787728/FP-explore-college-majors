7414130,5,B014KZK6YK,You do not need a region free player to watch these episodes. I have a Oppo BDP-103 bluray player and it is not region free and it only plays region 1 dvd's. I bought season 1 here on Amazon from a seller in England called Price Clock. They told me that even thought it says region B on the back that it will play fine on American players. However he said that the last 2 dvd's which contains the bonus features is not region free and can only be played on a computer and he was right on both counts. I have not bought season 2 yet because of the high price but he assured me that they will play as season 1 did. There is also another seller called Cinema Paradise here on Amazon that told me the same thing. I don't know why they play on my Oppo I'm just glad they do.,1463702400,5,769,3.967741935483871
7414131,1,B014KZK6YK,"* INCOMPLETE MIXED SOUNDTRACKS * POSSIBLY AFFECTING NUMEROUS EPISODES *
I hate to be the bringer of this news, but there is something important that I simply need to share about this release. What I feared and have warned about for years has unfortunately come true. There are missing FX sounds and incomplete mixing on the soundtracks of this release!
The strange but real phenomenon with missing FX sounds on Space:1999 Series 2 episodes was first discovered about 13 years ago by Scott M. Bosco, then consultant for A&E on the US Space:1999 DVD releases and previous Image Entertainment US video releases ( Bosco later meticulously drafted a comprehensive proposal to Carlton/Granada/ITV for the full 30th anniversary HD remastering of SPACE:1999, which was reviewed and accepted) Back then it was discovered by Bosco, albeit too late, that several episodes supplied to A&E and released suffered from unexplainable incomplete soundtrack mixing, this when compared with earlier video archive versions of the same episodes, also with original 1970`s broadcast off air taped versions. Bosco reported directly back to Carlton/Granada/ITV, who also shared with others on the ITC_DVD yahoo forum : (an excerpt)
""It seems that incomplete mixed audio tracks were sent to Carlton US. No one can explain it, but there are indeed gaps in the FX sound effects of certain episodes. These audio elements may have been earlier mixes, incomplete, or defected. As consultant in the US I was only sent 1 dupe, for 1 episode - NEW ADAM, NEW EVE. Pi**ed, yes, I am. Especially since I found out that A&E won't do anything about it. Truthfully, I don't blame them. Why should A&E/New Video have to pay for new glass masters if Carlton US had no choice in what elements CARLTON UK gave them.""
In March 2011, I personally brought up this matter directly with Fiona Maxwell, then Controller of Operations and Servicing and archivist Mark Stanborough of ITV Film Services. I did a pre-scheduled hour long telephone interview (recorded) with both of them together about the technical details of the film elements restoration of Year 2 which had been completed in 2007. At the time, Mark Stanborough told me that detailed inspection and restoration of the audio elements had not yet been undertaken. Today Stanborough works for Network and was the actual restoration producer on this bluray release. The details provided in the liner notes for the release is briefly stating that a combination of 35mm and original 1/2"" triple magnetic track masters were used, but no specific details have been provided on which masters were used on individual episodes.
Here follows one example of an unexplainable missing FX sound effect from the bluray version of the episode Immunity Syndrome occurring at 0:42:28 on the bluray disk.
It is in Act 4 Sc 142. INT. STRUCTURE
where Koenig is shown Zoran's protective suit discovered behind the panel and where he takes the helmet & touches the ear section: there is then a single clicking sound AND A PROLONGED HUMMING ELECTRONIC SOUND EFFECT lasting several seconds which is completely missing. Please note that the FX sound is missing in both the 5.1 mix and the original mono soundtrack on the bluray.
Here you can watch/listen to the complete original sound version at 00:40:44 in this online YouTube copy.[...]
So it is obvious that the responsible people directly in charge of this release didn't even bother to look thoroughly at this despite Bosco and myself bringing it to their personal attention several times and we now have a flawed incomplete restoration release, the extent is yet to be discovered. Simply inexcusable...",1450051200,11,3645,5.066555740432612
7414132,5,B014KZK6YK,Bought this off eBay with the understanding it was region free but it wasn't. It's region B. I contacted seller before purchase & they said I could return if not. I kept it anyway & bought a region free blu ray player off Amazon. Glad I did because I finished season 1 region free  (U.S.) on this player & have finished disc 1 region B on the same player. If you love this series I'd make the purchase. The advantage is I just bought Land of the Giants region 2 the complete series on DVD. You don't have to switch for DVD's according to the instructions. Great picture & sound quality as season 1 U.S. 5.1. Great extras. Highly recommend.,1449964800,2,639,4.325
7414133,5,B014KZK6YK,"This is the real deal!
You've never seen space 1999 season 2 look like this before, restored to perfection in the uk, in stereo sound and hi def picture quality.
The nuances come alive because of the sharpness and vibrancy of image now, so therefore actor performances seem so much more alive.
The special effects look stunning in hi def, considering the length of time ago that this series was made.
Only the bluray version shows the full effect of proper restoration though,, the ordinary dvd (although quite fabulously remastered) doesn't show the full effect of image and sound as the bluray.

Its not fair that the americans can't buy this at the moment on region 1, I guess we are fortunate over here regards this release, but take hart!

Buy the 'complete series' (season 1 + 2) as it is cheaper than either the 'Complete Series 1' or 'Complete Series 2' Box set.  Odd.

The disks are packed into one box, amazing that they can fit ten discs in there.

However the episodes for season 1 (I haven't checked season 2 yet) are out of order.  You'd think they would put the episodes in broadcast sequence, but no they didn't.  For this, I dropped a star.

7414142,5,B014KZK6YK,"Another beautiful high definition restoration for 1999!
I'm a little surprised this was made available in DVD format, there must be a number of Luddites like me in the Region 2 market.
This is a great restoration, the best ever to be released in DVD but as with the series 1 companion release I can see some subtle pixelation. It isn't annoying, just barely noticeable. You really have to be obsessive to see it.
Audio quality is vastly improved by the 5.1 mix. It adds a new and sorely needed dimension. A tremendous enhancement.
The extra features are a bit of a compromise compared to the old A&E Megaset. This new release has some things the A&E set doesn't have and vice versa. The new release doesn't include the Ice Lolly popsicle animated commercials or the fan produced epilogue, Message From Moonbase Alpha.
Unfortunately none of the extras have been restored including still photos which can only be viewed in slide show fashion with no pause option! All you can do is zoom in. Very inconsiderately frustrating.
There are no indexed chapter menus, you have to advance thru them on the fly with your remote.
There is also a missing sound effects issue with this release, particularly in the episode The Immunity Syndrome. When Commander Koenig puts on his helmet in preparation for dangerous alien contact Maya flips a switch on his communication device and nothing but silence. Not so in my A&E Carlton 30th Anniversary Megaset edition!
All these trivialities aside this new release is THE DVD pinnacle for SPACE:1999 and it truly is beautiful.
Onscreen menus are better here than the Series 1 release. All episodes are listed by title on one screen instead of two.
All 8 discs (6 for episodes, 2 for extras) are placed in one wide clear case instead of two like Series 1. Two of the discs are so difficult to remove I fear they will crack, and I don't like them overlapping each other either.
The discs themselves have the same ugly graphic design and are just numbered, no specific labeling.
There are no inserts or booklets.

I remember watching this entire series as a child of 8 when it first aired in the middle '70s. It was a heady time for Futurism, there was so much going on then.
We were all looking so forward to the Space Shuttle program and the Computer Revolution but that was before the reality of Profit First People Last was naturalized.
I consider this series as SPACE:1999 Version 2.0 because it is so different from the original concept. Not a bad thing but it does remind me of the original Star Trek series, probably because of Fred Freiberger's involvement as producer.
If memory serves Stanley Kubrick  filed a lawsuit regarding some similarities he saw with his film, 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1975. I don't remember what happened, if anything. Another complication that made production of this series so adverse.
Anyway I love 1999 for what it is, a brave struggle against hopeless odds, survivalism.
I find it interesting that Gerry Anderson suggested the Alphen's survival was the result of Divine Intervention at the end of the very difficult series 1. Enlightening and inspirational.
I regret there is no segue for the transition between the two versions of 1999.
I can't understand why the producers didn't recall the entire original cast and open series 2 with a calamity that would change everything instead of being so inconsiderately abrupt. Very asinine.

I do love both series (versions) of SPACE:1999.
It truly was a unique experience at the time and even more so now after these professional restorations.
Intelligent, intriguing and fun!

A worthwhile masterpiece.

Update: 2/19/18-

I know the Bluray edition currently has the best possible visual quality but the DVDs upscale BEAUTIFULLY with a 4K player & TV!
After watching this as a kid with an analog black & white TV and UHF antenna I am stunned by the audio-visuals!

A wonderful use of Futurist technology indeed, the kind we all dreamed of.

Beautiful.

Update: 3/27/18-

I now have the Bluray edition of this release and as expected it is more impressive but the DVD edition is a very close second.
Unfortunately the Blurays I received are Region B, you will need a Multi Region player or maybe an Xbox or Play Station to watch them.
The Series 1 Blurays are region free even though they are labeled Region B.
A frustrating inconsistency and very inconsiderate for consumers/collectors.

If you are a serious fan of 1999 go with the Blurays, they truly do upscale beautifully with a 4K player & TV.
Restoration of the entire series is stunning overall, far better than the Star Trek original series release.

I assume someday there will be a 4K edition but we will probably have 8K definition before that happens.

8731158,3,B014KZK6YK,"After a lukewarm reaction to the first season, Gerry and Sylvia Anderson received an order for a second season but the various companies ponying money asking for more action; in essence the money men wanted a series that was a little more like American science fiction such as ""Star Trek"". Unfortunately, many of the episodes are on the level of the third seasons of ""Lost in Space"" rarely even rising to the level of the horrid third season of ""Star Trek"". The irony, of course, was that the Andersons had hired the third season producer of ""Star Trek"" Fred Frieberger to revise the series in hope of making it more successful for syndication in the United States and other countries.

The changes that Frieberger made were decidedly mixed; Frieberger created the character of Maya a shape shifter (or Metamorph) as a Spock styled character--an alien that was an outsider but accepted as part of the crew. Actress Catherine Schnell (who had been a guest star on a season one episode already) did a fine job in the role. Other characters such as Victor Bergman (played by the marvelous Barry Morse) were eliminated and cost cutting moves were put into play including recycling visual effects footage shot for season one and a redesign of the command center that was simplified to save money as well.

Stars Martin Landau and Barbara Bain were unhappy with many of the decisions for the first season and they were even more unhappy with Frieberger's writing and producing. The Andersons' point-of-view was quite different with both believing that their stars were difficult (as they indicated with the commentary tracks/interviews for the DVD and first season Blu-ray) . Frieberger's scripts for the second season were often weak and sometimes nonsensical. While the first season could be a little too cerebral and driven by the Moonbase being on peril, the second season just introduced dumb ideas and characters aside from Maya.

As with the previous season, the second has been nicely restored. Image quality is very good to exceptional and the soundtrack has also been meticulously restored as well.

The second season set has some nice special features (although I would have preferred to have commentary tracks). We get a 1994 in depth interview with Martin Landau, a 1979 stop motion short ""Cosmos: 1999"", archive interviews, a second season episode presented in the style of the first season, some bloopers, clean opening and closing titles, unused visual effects sequences (with commentary by Brian Johnson) and script PDF's. There are some other minor special features here as well. The set doesn't include the feature length cut of ""Bringers of Wonder"" (that was released separtately as a taster much as ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" did with their ""feature length"" versions of various two part episodes).

The second season of ""Space: 1999"" was a definite step down with weaker writing (although some first season scripts were rewritten for use during season two), production values and a general dumbing down from producer Fred Frieberger. While Frieberger did alter the show, to be fair, it was at the request of the money people. The dissatisfaction of the cast and many of the writing staff became evident much later. Sadly, the series wasn't renewed for a third season although there were plans to continue on with a shorter (13 episodes) third season and a spin-off for the characgter of Maya (also 13 episodes) that didn't come to pass when ITV was unable to secure additional financing for the series.

I'm not sure if season two WILL receive a release on Blu-ray or not so those who want the second season may want to pick up an inexpensive blu-ray player programmed for region free viewing and purchasing the UK set.",1535328000,,3740,4.966453674121405

But back in the day, we ate it up with a spoon, because there was nothing else but Lost in Space and Star Trek reruns.

Martin Landau and wife Barbara Bain took on this impossible mission, supported by Barry Morse, another fugitive figure, and a multi-racial supporting cast (now where have I heard that, before?), brought to us by Gerry and Silvia Anderson's marvelous miniatures, in this, their second live action (not puppets) series.
