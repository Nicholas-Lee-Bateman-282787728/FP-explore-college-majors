8267001,5,B0017RFXLQ,These came so fast i was shocked at how fast they came loved all the movies. The quality of the DVDs was excellent.,1315267200,,115,4.043478260869565
8267002,1,B0017RFXLQ,"Don't get me wrong. I love ATHF. But you can buy all the individual sets much cheaper than in this collection,
(at least at the time of this note) so why pay extra? It's not like you're getting more material, or even special packaging.
Don't be seduced by price gouging!",1300060800,,270,4.42

8267004,1,B0017RFXLQ,I'd really like to buy this season but I'm not paying that for such a short clip. I actually think ATHF is only 11 min. Amazon should bundle shorter episodes when selling them.,1205366400,3,176,4.363636363636363
8267005,1,B0017RFXLQ,even at $1.89 its toooo much id like to have them but not for 2 bucks a pop,1203292800,3,75,3.2222222222222223
8267006,1,B0017RFXLQ,"I love this show, but it is only 15 minutes long.  I am not going to pay $2 an episode for a 15 minute show when that's the same price as 1 hour dramas on NBC.  You seriously need to rethink your pricing system.",1203033600,,211,3.772727272727273
