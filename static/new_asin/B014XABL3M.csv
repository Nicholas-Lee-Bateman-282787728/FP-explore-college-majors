7425226,5,B014XABL3M,"The introduction is about 10 minutes long and if you received this from Germany, Jonas is introducing Puccini's life story with many more pictures than the ""Nessum Dorma"". In other words you won't be missing much since it isn't in English.  If you love watching and listening to Jonas this is an amazing treasure.",1454198400,3,313,4.796296296296297
7425227,5,B014XABL3M,"Have received this and watched it. I loved it. The music is gorgeous, as one would expect, nd I enjoyed the introductory narrative. Jonas Kaufman sings beautifully but didn't seem to be as much at ease as usual until he reached the encores. However, this doesn't detract from his voice and I happily give this five stars.",1449014400,11,321,4.649122807017544
7425228,5,B014XABL3M,"I would rate this concert ""PERFECTION"" except for the one little flaw which was highly amusing:  He drew a lyric blank in the middle of the encore of Nessun Dorma.  Nice to see that even the best singers in the world forget the words occasionally.  He was very charming about it.  If you like Kaufmann (I happen to love him!) this concert must be added to your library as it is simply wonderful!  The orchestra plays all the great intermezzos from the Puccini operas and he sings all the great arias with plenty of encores.  He conquered La Scala - the Italians loved him and the ovations were tremendous.  I have the CD also of all the Puccini arias which are simply thrilling!  The seller got it to me in time for Christmas watching and sharing with friends.  As far as no Blue Ray, I would have like one but the quality of the DVD on a Blue Ray player is pretty much great!  Brian Large is always a great video director and his was superb.  Highly recommend this as a must buy!!",1448841600,21,981,4.306010928961749

7425230,4,B014XABL3M,"Good performance, good music.  Kaufmann looked thin and was perhaps, not feeling well. He speaks/sings Italian perfectly.  The two traditional, classic Italian songs at the end were nostalgic.  But isn't it a miracle that we can hear and watch a concert of this caliber without leaving the house?",1488844800,,296,5.125
7425231,5,B014XABL3M,"Absolutely beyond words!  Without a doubt, Kaufmann, in my opinion, is one of the finest tenors of our time. He puts so much thought into the both the music and acting resulting in an incomparable performance. It was so nice to hear the lesser known Puccini areas from his earlier works which are not that well- known to the general public. Being not only of Tuscan heritage, my maternal side of the family is Lucchese so I have always held a special adoration and love for Puccini. For this reason, this DVD is truly special.",1487376000,,526,4.536842105263158

7425233,5,B014XABL3M,one of the best dvds I've purchased in some time. I was very pleasantly surprised.  They left both Nessun Dorma versions in - I especially liked that.  It appeared -to me- that he was overcome with emotion on one and lost his voice. the audience [like myself] loved that.,1485993600,,271,4.510204081632653

7425238,5,B014XABL3M,"Unbelievable singing. Jonas Kaufman is the greatest tenor of our times (but it was a bit too much, even for him, to sing several encores!) Unforgettable evening, though. Bravo, Jonas!",1475539200,,183,5.133333333333334
7425239,5,B014XABL3M,"Mr. Kaufmann follows the historical progression of Puccini operas by performing  arias selected from Puccini's operas in the order they were composed.  His reputation is well deserved and the performances shine.  He is more of a helden tenor (his voice is darker than say Andrea Boccelli) and these choices suit his voice more than arias where the tenor should have a  younger voice (cf La Boheme).  IMO his ""e lucevan le stelle"" from the last act of Tosca has more dynamic range, finesse and nuance than Pavarotti's -  his pianissimo's in this aria are not to be believed.  Jaw dropping!  I purchased this DVD in lieu of attending the Fandango re-broadcast of this concert and now instead of hearing it once I can enjoy it many times for the same expenditure.",1474934400,3,760,4.748091603053435
7425240,5,B014XABL3M,"Puccini's music so beautifully played, sung, and filmed. Jonas Kaufmann's triumphant La Scala concert is the tenor reaching the full embodiment of his remarkable talent, voice and ability to reveal the true joy of a singer's soul. And a no better vehicle for this than the glorious tenor repertoire of Puccini. The film clips of the maestro in his youth and latter years is a valuable addition to the understanding of this music genius.",1474502400,,436,4.905405405405405

7425242,1,B014XABL3M,BORING.........Boring..........Boring.  I am a huge opera fan.  I read the reviews on this DVD and bought it for a surprise gift for a friend.  Sat down to watch it together and after about 10 minutes we looked at each other and said............Yuk.....this it boring and it is poorly edited.  Don't waste your money,1473379200,,316,4.90566037735849

7425245,2,B014XABL3M,"Unless the viewer wants to hear music of Puccini that isn't well known or usually recorded, this DVD will be a boring experience. A good portion of the recording is dedicated to symphonic compositions, Additionaly, the portion presenting Jonas Kauffman is partially devoted to arias of the initial Puccini's operas which, at least in my opinion, aren't very good.",1470700800,2,363,5.169491525423729
7425246,5,B014XABL3M,excellent !  Missed some more familiar Puccini though.,1470614400,,54,5.75
7425247,3,B014XABL3M,"I found this highly-touted tenor recital at the prestigious LA SCAL OPERA HOUSE in Milan to be extremely disappointing.  Jonas Kaufmann has risen to the heights in the Wagner canon.  He is the hottest Wagnerian tenor on the rosters today.  That said, his voice betrays a timbre that is extremely dark and dry. a criticism I have made of the otherwise grand tenor, Placido Domingo.  Puccini wrote a number of verismo operas.  They tend to be gutsy dramas with simple, common people at the heart to the drama.  Mr. Kaufmann tends to ""press"" his voice in the ""big"" moments of an aria, and when he does, he tends to bellow.  The tone turns hard and unappealing.  Obviously, the audience did not agree with me.  To each his own.",1469232000,5,723,4.5859375
7425248,5,B014XABL3M,"If you or someone you love enjoy opera, an evening with Puccini with Jonas Kaufmann should be at the very top of your list, there is no doubt that Kaufmann is fabulous. So enjoyable.",1469059200,,182,4.382352941176471

7425258,2,B014XABL3M,"Very disappointed. I have his recordings of complete operas which are superb. He is primarily a dramatic vocalist, not just an aria singer. The La Scala audience comes to be seen and heard cheering with screetching bravos. Even before the last notes are finished. And the conductor applauding from the podium, is a disgrace to classical music. La Scala goes for the gaudy, to say the least. The videos of their opera productions show very little taste, but lots of spectacle. Except for Mirella Freni in ""Adriana Le Couvier"" I have never heard audiences scream wildly in German or British Opera houses. I felt sorry for Puccini, and the way singers use his works out of context, for sensation and profit.",1462320000,3,704,4.8264462809917354

7425264,5,B014XABL3M,Kaufman continues to amaze me. He is at home with Puccini but can be just as comfortable with Wagner. Any fan of Puccini will love this DVD. The opening is a wonderful bonus.

7425267,5,B014XABL3M,"The first time I saw Jonas Kaufmann in an opera I was unfamiliar with him and his talent. After that first opera, 'Tosca,' he brought me to tears during Mario's final aria of the opera. And, I've been a fan since that night. It does not matter whether he's engaged in an opera, recital, or concert. He is a delight to listen to. This performance is no exception. The selections are well sung and performed by him and the orchestra. If you love Puccini, you'll love this concert. Highly recommend.",1454976000,7,496,4.522222222222222
