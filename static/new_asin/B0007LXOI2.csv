8048624,5,B0007LXOI2,"For any kid that loves the Neverending Story movies, this makes a nice DVD for your youngsters to continue with the story.
After watching the movies, my kids were craving more. So I bought this and was suprised how much they enjoyed it.
Worth the buy.",1383609600,3,251,4.478260869565218
8048625,3,B0007LXOI2,"This DVD is a great addition to any fan's collection, but it is very limited. For a series that ran for 26 episodes you would expect to get more than just three episodes on this disk. Especially considering that most incomplete DVD releases for animated series contain at least 5 episodes. One good alternative to this DVD is that the Amazon Unbox offers the entire series for download.

The three episodes in this release are the first three produced for the series: The Tears of Sadness, The Meek and the Mighty, and The Purple Buffalo.",1210291200,4,538,4.663157894736842
