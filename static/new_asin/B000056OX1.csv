Yoga has been refined for centuries and Joseph Pilates was something of a genius. So each system is great unto itself but especially as done here trying to create a hybrid system is not a good idea.",1398297600,,308,4.237288135593221
7932546,5,B000056OX1,"This is a great combo yoga/pilates starter tape.  I like the length (45 minutes) and the range, and you can stop at segments or move forward to other areas if you want to do it in parts.  Jonathan has a great way to make you feel relaxed and easily explains what you are to do, even when you can't see the screen.  HIs NY Pilates tapes are also really good.",1244073600,,357,4.071428571428571
7932547,5,B000056OX1,"I'm one of those people who keeps meaning to exercise, but I just never seem to be able to stick to anything for too long. I got this DVD from my local library about two months ago and am hooked! This is such a wonderful blend of stretching, toning and relaxing poses that I just cannot but keep coming back for more. Although fairly slim, I am pretty inflexible and found this DVD just right for a beginner like myself. I can really feel the effects and feel so energized after every workout. I have now ordered level two yogilates by Jonathan Urla because I feel I'd like a little more challenge. I really enjoy this workout though, so I might just try to incorporate a few more advanced adjustments to the layout of this DVD and progress gradually.

The DVD itself is divided into three sections. You can do one section, the whole session with pauses in between or all at once. Jonathan is really pleasant, gives good cues and suggests modifications if you feel your back is tight. I highly recommend this DVD.",1239926400,2,1013,4.475675675675675
7932548,4,B000056OX1,"This is an excellent choice for people who are new to a physical fitness program of this ilk.  The poses incorporate Hatha Yoga with some Pilates exercises thrown in for good measure.  The program is broken into three parts, so the viewer can take a break if needed between.
Jonathan Urla is a pleasant instructor, and seems very knowledgable of body and movement.  He does the workout along with three other participants, giving full explanation of each pose, all the while looking cool and collected. Correct breathing techniques are included.  Otherwise, the music and the surroundings are also pleasant and not intrusive.
There is no mystical aspect for yoga purists.  This is a physical fitness regiment.  It would serve anyone who is seeking to go further in either yoga asana or Pilates.  Definitely a must for Yogilates Two.",1075507200,3,832,4.9855072463768115
7932549,5,B000056OX1,Have the first workout tape and love it. Can work through the entire tape even at the end of the longest day and not feel I am forcing myself to do it. This is a first.,1011657600,4,168,3.6944444444444446
7932550,5,B000056OX1,"This is an answer to your fitness prayers! Ever notice how most pilates tapes have no stretching at the end?  This is great combination.  After a brief warmup there is traditional Pilates section, followed by yoga poses to stretch and tone the lower body.  The whole workout tones your ""core"".  The abs, back and butt.  This is great for beginners who are unfamiliar with either discipline.  And, you will not be sore the next day!",992736000,19,431,4.68
