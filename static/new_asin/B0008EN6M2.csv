8055734,5,B0008EN6M2,"Terence Dunn is the best Chi Kung teacher on media. I have tried other tapes and DVDs over the years, but still come back to Mr Dunn. He is clear, precise and has a calming demeanour.  I have yet to take one of his classes personally, but I do not expect him to be any different in person.  If you want to learn Chi Kung from a tape or DVD, this is it. The DVDs including this one have a lot of features which allow you to customize your lessons.

This particular DVD is the third in the series. They are standing exercises. Part I consists of basic standing exercises and Part 2 of basic seating exercises. This one, Part 3 assumes that you have mastered Parts 1 and 2. The energy builds upon ground covered by Parts 1 and 2. The choreography in these two exercises are a lot more complex. Once you have mastered the movements, you are supposed to perform them with eyes closed, after some breathing sequences.

If you perform them regularly, at some point the subconscious mind appears to take over as your consciousness enters into a brown study, and you can actually feel the surging rivers of healing and thrilling chi in the body. You do not do the exercises necessarily looking to feel the chi. Just pay attention to doing them correctly. That will come. Undoubtedly it will come.",1171152000,28,1287,4.440677966101695
8055735,5,B0008EN6M2,Terrence Dunn and The Flying Phoenix Chi Kung is the best program that I have encountered for learning Chi Kung on your own. I have bought many other DVDs on the subject but none as helpful and easy to implement in your life. All his DVDs are excellent. I use this DVD for daily practice with my staff and patients.,1151539200,17,315,4.266666666666667
