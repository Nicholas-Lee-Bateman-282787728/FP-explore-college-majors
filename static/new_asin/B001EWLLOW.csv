8326426,3,B001EWLLOW,"I was initially excited to get this DVD. Gappa ( Monster From A Prehistoric Planet) was one of my favorites when I was a Kid. Yongary I had only seen one time after school as the 4 o'clock movie (the good old days)and did not get to see all of it then. Both movies were decent movies Gappa probably being the best of the two. However, the visual and sound quality was terrible on Gappa. The picture was extremely dark in spots to the point where you could see nothing on the screen and at times could only see shadows of the actors faces. I would like to know if something went wrong in the transfer process or if someone just did a bootleg (lol) and sold it as a DVD. I was somewhat suprised with Yongary the picture quality was okay though the picture did get fuzzy in spots and the sound was decent almost to the point that I think someone redid the audio portion of this movie. I will be searching for a better version of Gappa( Monster From A Prehistoric Planet) soon! If anyone knows of a better version let me know. Thanks!",1267833600,2,1030,4.233502538071066
