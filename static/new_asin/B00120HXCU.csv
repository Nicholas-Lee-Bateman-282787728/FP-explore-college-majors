The story follows an overstressed school teacher who is looking to get away from it all and seclude herself on an island for a few days, only to find that happiness comes from a realization of one's interdependence with the other. The film is quiet and beautifully shot, with a wonderfully quirky soundtrack and stellar performances from all of the actors.

It is also a definite foodie movie - lingering shots of Japanese island foods induce salivation every time. I have yet to find good Japanese shaved ice with sweet bean paste in the States, and the craving just won't stop... Simple pleasures are used in the film as gateways to satori, and, if nothing else, the film provides an excuse to enjoy good food, good friends, and relaxation.

If you're looking from a departure from the norm, and an excuse for a couple of hours of aural and visual meditation, don't pass this one up.",1382400000,2,972,4.645348837209302
8243266,5,B00120HXCU,"A teacher decides to spend her vacation on an island where there isn't much to do. She stays in a hotel, in which she finds the people and their daily routine strange. In addition, everybody is wondering what she is doing there if she is not good at ""twilighting."" Frustrated, she leaves for another hotel but quickly goes back to Sakura-san, Yuji and the biology teacher, who is always late for her classes.

A charming movie indeed and philosophical. There is no money on this island, nor possessions. People do their ""merci"" exercises every morning, enjoy their meals and each others company. And that's it. It's all that matters. It's simplicity in its purest form. Enjoy!",1244678400,5,676,4.827586206896552
