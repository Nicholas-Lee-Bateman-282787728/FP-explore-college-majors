6355515,5,B00JEEZT22,All of these reviews seem to be for the horrendous Tom Sizemore slasher movie Murder101 released in 2014. Could not be more different than the Dick Van Dyke lighthearted murder mystery that is going to be released in May featured here. Another unfortunate Amazon glitch. As a fan of Diagnosis Murder this was a fun spin to see after Diagnosis Murder was concluded. Instead of a doctor of medicine - Dr. mark Sloan - Dick Van Dyke plays a college professor - Dr. Johnathan Maxwell. As with anything that Dick Van Dyke does it is funny and enjoyable as well as family friendly. For this release you have a pair of murder mysteries that will not give you nightmares and one you can watch with your children without worrying. There are three Murder 101 movies and these are the 2 later ones (If Wishes Were Horses and New Age) so I am hoping that it is a misprint and the first one (College Can Be Murder) will be included in this set as well. I am so glad that they are finally releasing these on DVD! I will be watching for the others.,1490486400,46,1033,4.357512953367876
6355516,1,B00JEEZT22,This is the worst movie I have ever tried to watch on Amazon. I want my money back!,1408060800,,83,3.6666666666666665
6355517,1,B00JEEZT22,"I rented this movie thinking that I would be getting a smart murder mystery. Smart because the setting is supposedly at a law school.  Perhaps Tom Sizemore - who I generally like - would play a gruff, smart cop who would apply his experience in unraveling the crime.

Instead, what I got was a kind of ""slasher terrorizes college students"" movie. It could have been ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween.""  Sizemore was a non-existent factor in the movie, as the actual killers are catspaws of the real serial killer.  The weight of the movie was carried by unknown actors and actresses who are fairly wooden in their acting. The dialogue is not much better. There are huge holes in logic, motivation and plotting.  For example, people around the main character - Fiona (who is either the daughter of the real serial killer or not) - are being brutally murdered, but we cut from the scene of the brutal murder of a couple of her friends to her bouncily walking to her car (to be accosted by her creepy boyfriend) in the next scene.

This is another movie where people just show up where they are supposed to show up at the right moment without any particular explanation. For example, the cops show up at the end at just the right time to save Fiona's life...out in the middle of a forest....without any explanation for how they just happened to be behind Fiona, who has been running randomly though a woodland to escape her pursuers.

Again, this kind of thing just pegs the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" meter into the red.

The big reveal at the end is a waste of time, as is the implication that Fiona - who ultimately doesn't engage the viewer - is carrying on the serial killing career of her maybe, maybe not, father.

Sheldon Robins as Detective Caterson was the only actor who seemed to stand-out from the generally lackluster pack.  Perhaps, Sizemore needed a paycheck, but he was wasted in this movie.",1405814400,7,1910,4.624260355029586
6355518,1,B00JEEZT22,"This movie was so bad I had to stop watching it ,wasted my money don't even bother ... Honestly wish I could get my 4 dollars back",1404000000,6,130,3.8518518518518516
6355519,5,B00JEEZT22,Tom Sizemore's performance is brilliant! His character is crazy. It suits him well. The story is very thought provoking with tons of twists and turns. It was suspenseful and even funny at times. The end was full of surprises that I didn't expect. Overall I enjoyed the film.,1403827200,6,274,4.729166666666667
6355520,5,B00JEEZT22,Loved it,1522627200,,8,3.5

6355523,5,B00JEEZT22,I loved watching this dvd.,1519430400,,26,4.4
6355524,3,B00JEEZT22,"Apparently the reviews for these  made for TV films include those for another show by this name..... so one should take care in reading them..
As a fan of the very similar series which ran 8 seasons with the father-son duo, I would recommend these to those who did not see the original (where Dick played a physician rather than a College Professor) as  good watching and advise those familiar with the original that it will likely appear to be a somewhat tired version of the 50 minute shows....watchable but lacking in the zing that the cast of the series were able to impart.  I must admit that by the 40 minute mark, I had already tired of the idiosyncrasies emphasized in  Dick's role. Certainly,  the creative staff did not make much of the additional time with which they had to work as compared with the originals.",1519257600,,822,4.5646258503401365
6355525,2,B00JEEZT22,So dull.  Not at all as good as a Diagnosis Murder tv episode.,1519257600,,62,3.769230769230769

6355527,5,B00JEEZT22,"I actually started watching this and turned it off because it didn't really catch my interest. I'm glad I returned to finish because I didn't know what kind of treat I was going to receive by finishing this set. I love a good mystery, and I'll admit, I also like a good, quirky mystery. This one is tops.",1518048000,4,304,4.258620689655173

6355531,4,B00JEEZT22,I love Diagnosis Murder and Dick Van Dyke. This dvd was a little different than Diagnosis Murder but just as good.,1509926400,3,114,4.476190476190476
6355532,5,B00JEEZT22,"This set has a couple of movies done by Dick Van Dyke and his son, Barry. They play different characters from the Diagnosis Murder series, but of course the two of them are essentially the same. This is fine by me, since I enjoy them both just as they are. It never ceases to amaze me that Barry's voice sounds exactly like his father while he does not look like him. I enjoy these laid-back mysteries where I can relax and have a good time, rather than add to my anxiety for the day. I'm starting a collection of Diagnosis Murder and Murder She Wrote, so that I can have a fun evening of TV for a change.",1509667200,3,605,4.135593220338983

6355538,3,B00JEEZT22,Fair and some good moments but not nearly the quality of others.,1506729600,,64,4.416666666666667
6355539,3,B00JEEZT22,"These two movies look great and have appealing story lines with the Van Dykes in major roles. However the only negative thing that I see, which is unique to any movie I have previously seen, is that background music is continuously played from start to finish in both. Music has an important role to play during transitions and at key moments, but makes what you're watching unrealistic and distracting when played when people are speaking. I would give five stars otherwise, but it would have been far more enjoyable if music was used at the right moments and not ad nauseum, regardless of how light it is.",1505952000,,607,4.682242990654205
