Then there's Stanley Tucci, Jerry Lewis and Tim Curry to look forward to but the first year was the best.",1059523200,2,336,4.138461538461539
1883794,5,B00009L502,"I nearly jumped for joy when I saw that this great series was going to be released in DVD format--all I can say is ""It's about time!"" This was the show which pioneered ""story arcs"" where a plot line ran through a limited number of episodes of a series. In the first season of ""Wiseguy"", there were not one but two fabulous story arcs. The first arc featured the late, great Ray Sharkey in a searing performance as the crime lord Sonny Steelgrave--anyone who saw the last episode of this arc must wonder to this day why Sharkey didn't get an Emmy nomination for his performance. The second arc (which I actually saw before I saw the Steelgrave arc) featured a then-unknown actor named Kevin Spacey who was as memorable as in his performance as Ray Sharkey was in his. Which is not to slight the regulars in the series--they were all wonderful. If the thought of another so-called reality series makes you violently ill, do check out this DVD set when it comes out--this is truly imaginative and creative television art!",1057881600,2,1018,4.5989010989010985
1883795,4,B00009L502,"This incredible series started off almost unnoticed, yet by the end of the first season, everyone knew about ""WISEGUY"".  From the casting to the writing to the directing to the performances, this series (with very few exceptions) was the best crime series of its day, & still holds up with the best of them almost 20 years hence.  Very few shows these days haven't drawn on the original concept of ""WISEGUY""'s multi-story arc format, & it's safe to say that shows such as ""NYPD Blue"" & ""The Shield"" owe much of their success to ""WISEGUY.  Personally, I can't wait for all the sets to come out on DVD (even though they're excluding some of the original VERY dynamic music)!!  If you've not seen this series, you're doing yourself an enormous disservice.",1056931200,,752,4.717557251908397
1883796,5,B00009L502,"...And that is not hyperbole.
It might seem strange to say that there are some shows that are just ""too good"" to survive for long on TV, but Wiseguy was one of them. This was not your standard cop show; for one thing shows were done in arcs; there were stand-alone episodes of Wiseguy but very few. You HAD to follow the show week-to-week, meaning that anyone who came in after the first or second episodes, might have been lost. That right there pretty much guaranteed a short shelf life. But along with that was that every episode came loaded with excellently-acted characters, layered with engrossing subplots and peppered with details that may have seemed small at first, but came to be more realized as the story progressed. The show developed a small, but loyal cult audience, out of pure logic. You couldn't be a ""casual viewer."" of Wiseguy. You were either in all the way or you weren't.
Ken Wahl's character works for the ""OCB"" (yes the FBI of course) and infiltrates NY mobsters; these are the same guys Vinnie grew up around all his life, guys his dad knew, etc, and he can't help but become empathetic towards Sonny Steelgrave, a cocky, Napoleonic type guy quickly making his way up the ladder.
The final ending of the saga is somewhat predictable, but the method and the sweeping dramatics are what will keep you riveted for the final chapter titled ""No One Gets Out Alive"". Its one of the greatest single shows in TV in my humble opinion. Hopefully, if this sells well, they'll put out the arc featuring Kevin Spacey as a psychotic, paranoid crime kingpin. This is truly something to keep in your collection forever. It's hard to believe this came from Stephen J. Cannell, who was also the producer of ""The A-Team"" which was on a whole opposite end of the spectrum away from ""Wiseguy"".",1056499200,3,1799,4.6426332288401255

1883799,3,B00009L502,"This has been one of my favorite TV shows for a long time now, and it is worth watching for the quality of the writing alone. When you add in the incredible actors they had working on it, it is unbeatable. I was over the moon when I heard it was coming out on DVD. Then I heard that some of the music from the series was to be cut -- most notably ""Nights in White Satin"" by the Moody Blues. This is disappointing, as the musical selections were well made, heightening the mood wonderfully. And now I see that what I thought was going to be a set of the full first season is probably only the first half? Admittedly, I haven't checked the prices of every TV show on DVD out there, but compared with other things I have purchased this seems to be running about twice what other sets cost. I was planning on ordering this right away, but now I am hesitant. I think I am going to wait to hear the reviews in case there are other things I should know about before investing quite so much money.
*****
[Added later]  I've just had a chance to look at this new package.  It's really pretty in hand, and the transfers look good.  The ""gag reel"" is pretty mediocre as these things go, and doesn't seem to warrant all the warnings (danger: offensive material) leading up to it.  One gem:  the interview with Jonathan Banks is great.  He's an incredibly underrated actor (mostly by people who only ever saw him in ""Otherworlds"" and ""Cold Steel"").  I haven't yet had the courage to watch the scenes with their music changed.
I'd like to know something, though -- just how quickly was this put together?  The final Ray Sharkey ep is listed as ""No One Get's Out of Here Alive""  (Get's?????), and there are no chapter breaks in any of the episodes.  That just seems sloppy.  I won't gripe about Annette Bening's name on the box -- it's just there to sell an extra copy or two.  I also don't understand the choice to add ""People Do It All The Time"" and ""Meet Mike McPike"" as the extras.  Sure, they're standalone eps, but they come from much later in the series.  And wouldn't it make more sense to pair ""Call it Casaba"" with ""People Do It All The Time"", as they deal with the same characters?
Still, if you want good copies of the episodes, this is the only way to go.  It's a brilliant series, and I want people watching it.  But heck, doesn't it deserve just a little more effort?",1055894400,2,2367,4.297297297297297
1883800,5,B00009L502,"I'm delighted to find out that part one of the first season of Wiseguy is due to be released on DVD. It's almost certain that we're dealing here with the Sonny Steelgrave arc alone, on account of the set's total time of 600 minutes that suffices to include 10-11 episodes only.
General background -
------------------------
Wiseguy tells the story of Vincent Terranova (played by Ken Wahl), a.k.a Vinnie, who had been originally assigned to the Undercover Agents plan of the O.C.B (Organized Crime Bureau), and was sent to prison for a year and a half to substantiate his cover as a criminal, in the eyes of the under world. The story starts as he gets out of jail, and it becomes clear that his purpose in life is to bring down the crime barons of the U.S. The figures that help and support him are Frank McPike (Jonathan Banks), his supervising officer and the lifeguard 'Uncle Mike Terranova' also known as Daniel Benjamin Burroughs (Jim Byrnes). This program is divided into story arcs of varying lengths with regulars and new characters appearing in each arc.
The uniqueness of Wiseguy is embedded in its rare treatment of the negative characters; a common person could earn a rare glimpse into the world in which people are so different from himself - yet so much alike - and sometimes understand and identify with their problems and actions.
The Steelgrave Arc -
----------------------
All the above is told primarily in regard to this arc, which is the best of the series; the arc's remarkable cast and its outstanding performance, superb storyline and multidimensional characters, sadness and, ultimately, striking significance make it unmatched compared to all the arcs that followed it. Masterfully orchestrated action scenes are also an important factor that adds a lot to the appeal of this arc.
And, yes, Ray Sharkey - without him it couldn't be the same. Ray Sharkey probably gives the roll of his lifetime with the portrayal of Sonny Steelgrave - the crime boss of New Jersey - as one of the most humane characters ever to be seen on television. His actions and motives, for good or ill, are understood and almost justified in the eyes of the viewer. The battle between right and wrong was never so strong, confusing and challenging.
It is clear, after a few chapters, that the major issue is actually the decline of the Steelgrave empire. The weakness and vulnerability of Sonny become the center of the series, as the viewer sees how everybody in the underworld wants to get a piece of his crumbling realm. His racketeering enterprises, relatively small time crimes and drug distribution become minor as he has to face his formidable enemies with the help of Vinnie, that becomes his right hand, and that is also doomed to be his Brutus.
Episode overview:
---------------------
Pilot (episodes 1 & 2) - this is the classic opening of the series.  Right in the beginning you'll witness the release of Vinnie from the Newark State Penitentiary, a scene to be shown from that point on in the monumental opening theme by Mike Post. In a remembered early scene Vinnie initiates first contact with Sonny - and the rest is history; most of the major characters are presented and from that point on things start rolling pretty fast. In all, the foundations of the story are put in place, not without puberty hardships that would be amended later on.
New Blood - an unforgettable episode, in which the characters of Sonny and of Vinnie are engaged in one of the zeniths of their relationship's development process. From that point on you'll be captured by the charm of this arc to the end. Originally, I'd seen this episode first (and saw the pilot after quite sometime) and it left an unfading impact on me - definitely not for the last time.
The loose canon - in my money, one of the weakest in this arc, though quite interesting. We're starting to see how the lies affect Vinnie's life, but there were better episodes to illustrate this angle. The action scene in which Vinnie is shooting some bad guys while standing in a limousine is one of the most memorable of the series.
The birthday surprise - a redundant episode that presents two formidable villains - The Zhoratso's. You might also remember the funny name Kiki Vanno after watching this one.
One on one - a memorable episode with Annette bening. It has an especially thrilling scene in which Sonny almost reveals Vinnie's cover, and a hard scene about the tortures and then rescue of Frank McPike from captivity.
Prodigal son - a strong episode in which Vinnie tells his mother, that has been in the dark regarding his true occupation, that he is a Fed. Another aspect of Sonny's weakness, humanity and compassion is revealed.
A deal's a deal - one of the best episodes ever, originally it was made after the arc was finished, when the producers had decided to add a little more to the overall scheme of things; the three major points of interest here are the astounding attempt made by corrupt police officers to expose Vinnie's cover, the setting of the stage for the final conclusion and the introduction of Joey Romanauski, the real life singer Billy Vera. The song he sings, ""Ronnie's song"", is one of the best I've ever heard, partly, I guess, because of the emotions this episode generated in me. Evidently - top notch performances of all the players involved. The lesson learned in this episode (which is embedded in its name) is one not to be forgotten.
The marriage of heaven and hell - the name refers to the upcoming wedding of Sonny with Teresa Baglia, the daughter of a has-been crime boss, mostly in order to strengthen Sonny's position in the eyes of the underworld. There is a complicated and messy betrayal triangle in the story, that leads to the arc's climax in the next episode. I remember being totally shocked and confused seeing the developments in this episode. However, it is nothing compared to the occurrences of the next episode.
No one gets out of here alive - this is one of the most significant episodes - and probably the saddest - in the history of television. The most ill-fated finale of all times will always be a sad monument to everything this story is about: friendship, trust, loyalty and betrayal, choices, the different points of view people have and of how confusing the distinction between right and wrong, good and bad, true and false can be. The interweaving of the song ""Nights in white satin"" right before the horrific end will forever remind me of the true sadness and loss I felt during and after the heartbreaking and devastating conclusion.",1054598400,50,6565,4.763827919227392

This is a much more polished set than the Season 1 edition I received.  It has an included booklet and two extra DVDs containing 4 additional episodes (possibly from Part 2 of Season 2?) that includes commentary options from Ken Wahl himself.

I have to say that the entire ""Wiseguys"" team seems to have hit their collective stride in Season 2.  The writing seems better and more cohesive through the story arc--this one featuring a White Supremecy storyline that includes a much younger Paul Guilfoyle (CSI) and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson (always a terrific actor).  Jonathan Banks has toned down the heat a little and seems more human, while Ken Wahl continues to kill this role.  Really hoping to get the second part of Season 2!",1464652800,,874,4.832214765100671

However, as an adult, I was shocked to see that the special effects were very rudimentary (not good) and the aliens didn't even look convincing).  So I was nervous about purchasing Wiseguy.  I was obsessed with this show when it was on the air.  I'm relieved to say that it is still good.

01. Going Home

The original network broadcast of season two had 22 episodes. Amazon's package is missing the following episodes:

* Dead Dog Lives
* And It Comes Out Here
* The Rip-Off Stick
* High Dollar Bop
* Hip Hop on the Gravy Train
* The One That Got Away
* Living and Dying in 4/4 Time

If you're familiar with the series, that is the entire ""Dead Dog Records"" story arc. I've heard that there have been problems getting the rights to the music in that arc. Maybe that's why they aren't included. That's bad because the package is missing a lot of good episodes.

To make up for that, the package contains two episodes from the third season, Meet Mike McPike and The Romp. These are filler episodes (meaning not in a main story arc). The McPike episode does a great job of filling out Frank McPike's character, but Amazon did a disservice because it hurts the continuity. To avoid a great deal of confusion, you should watch the videos in the following order:

01. Going Home
02. School of Hard Knox
03. Revenge of the Mud People
04. Last of the True Believers

With the exception of a few episodes, I thought that the quality of the video and audio were acceptable. It was actually better than Mill Creek's DVD's for season one. There were some notable exceptions during the Garment District arc. In some of these, the audio was out of sync with the video by as much as a half second. In another episode, the video was very jerky, almost like watching a video online. This was on a TiVo where the entire season had been downloaded to the hard drive.

There was one other thing that I found very annoying - the volume level was not consistent between episodes. Some were so faint that we had to crank up the stereo. And, of course, the following episodes would be much louder so we'd have to scramble for the remote to turn it down.

If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this package. The combination of missing episodes, incorrect ordering and bad audio are just too much. I like the series enough that I would by a higher quality, more complete set but I can't recommend this package to anyone.",1295395200,10,3468,4.312307692307693

1883863,5,B00009L502,"I might be a little biased, but I have to say I love Wiseguy and the Sonny Steelgrave arc is my all time favorite!  I remember being in high school and having to tape episodes on my VCR :-), so I could watch them after my basketball games.  Then I remember going off to college and making the girls in my dorm watch Wiseguy in the lounge.  They all wanted to watch China Beach, but I had different ideas.

Anyway, I loved the show then and loved it as much watching it about 20 years later.  I am now married with 2 children and watching the series evokes all of the same old emotions.  I love the complex and emotional relationship that develops between Vinnie and Sonny. I also love Frank and his ""quirky"" personality. The writing and acting are superb and I would give the set more than five stars if I could.  I also enjoyed the interviews with Stephen J. Cannell and Jonathan Banks.  It is so fun to hear in their own words how they felt about the show.

I also purchased the Mel Profitt arc and enjoyed it. I especially appreciated the bonus interviews with Kevin Spacey and William Russ (among others).  I remember being so intrigued with Wiseguy when I was younger and that same intrigue holds true today. It amazes me all of the talented guest stars they had that went on to do so well. It is definitely worth every penny and I would recommend both arcs to anyone.  I am looking at getting the next set and will hopefully be as pleased with those.  Thanks Stephen J.

In fact, I suggest you watch this version on an old set, like the first time...kick back and enjoy Ray Sharkey in his very memorable role.

As I said, there were only two discs, which means that it didn't contain the Profit arc. I suppose, I was taken by the fact that I was a loyal weekly watcher of the series when it first aired and really wanted it for my collection. However, it seems to have disappeared from retail stores, when I first saw it released years ago. Now my next order of business is to start over and invest in the set that includes the whole series.

1883875,5,B00009L502,"So like a lot of (most?) fans of this show, I saw these episodes once over twenty years ago. But this show, the first season, and these episodes assumed legendary proportions in my memory ('round about episode 7 I had decided I this was the best mob story since ""The Godfather"".) I have now discovered they are every bit as great as I remembered them. I found Ken Wahl growing into the part very quickly. Of course, Ray Sharkey is electrifying. Dennis Lipscomb as Sid Royce and Joe Dallesdandro as ""Pat the Cat"" Patrice are incredibly vivid.  Jonathan Banks as our hero's boss, Frank McPike, is terrific.  Sonny's murder of Patrice at the end of ""A Marriage of Heaven and Hell"" scared the pants off me (much more so than Robert NeNiro's similar turn in ""The Untouchables"".)  And then there's the concluding episode: ""No One Gets Out of Here Alive"". Starts a little slow, because the story has to plausibly trap Vince and Sonny together, alone, for 30 minutes. But even the loss of ""Knights in White Satin"" from the soundtrack can't diminish the power of that final confrontation. And I rediscovered something I had forgotten entirely - this exchange between Vince and McPike after Sonny is dead...

1883878,5,B00009L502,"I remember how much I loved the show, ""Wiseguy"", when it was on in the late 80's, and I was thrilled to finally get the first season on DVD.  It is a powerful show that was very well done, in the quality of a big screen movie on the small screen.  The writing is excellent.  Instead of special effects and stunts, the show was character driven and the story arcs were well developed.  ""Wiseguy"" was created by Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo.  Cannell is well known for his amazing work in many successful series including ""Hunter"", `Rockford Files"" and ""A-Team"".

Ken Wahl became his character, Vinnie Terranova.  Vinnie, an undercover agent for the Organized Crime Bureau, struggled with the fine line between the crime he worked to bring down and the people behind it.  He goes so far undercover that the work takes an emotional toll on him and with the help of his field supervisor, Frank McPike (played by Jonathan Banks) and ""Lifeguard"" (played by Jim Brynes)-Vinnie works through his demons.

The first season has two story arcs.  The show built its'characters around a specific crime syndicate that Vinnie infiltrates and works to destroy the crime within.  The first story arc centers around a crime syndicate led by Sonny Steelgrave (probably the best role of Ray Sharkey's career).  Following this story, you experience along with Vinnie-the difficulties of his work, his alienation from his family and all that is dear to him.  Even at the final confrontation between Vinnie and Sonny, an amazing scene well acted by Wahl and Sharkey, you see the struggle.  In this scene, Vinnie tells Sonny that, ""it never occurred to me that we would be friends.  There is a lot in you I felt close to"".  In other scene with his mother, she tells Vinnie (to help him gain perspective on his relationship with Steelgrave), ""What good is it when a man loves his own children but kills someone else's"".

In the second story, Kevin Spacey portrays Mel Proffit, a psychopath, who heads an international drug and arms business with his sister, Susan.  Vinnie gets entangled with these two and their hired gun, Roger LoCocco (played well by William Russ).  The best way to describe Mel Proffit-Sonny Steelgrave is a saint compared to him.  This character will give you chills and Spacey nails him beautifully.

Re-watching the first season of ""Wiseguy"" was very enjoyable-very intense and compelling series that I am thrilled to have in my library.  If you like a well written and well acted crime drama that will keep your attention, you can't go wrong with ""Wiseguy"".

One note of caution, the packing of this newly released first season is not very good. All you get is a box with the four enveloped DVDs-there are no bonus materials or extra text with the set.  I watched it all and the DVDs play fine.  The 22 episodes are complete and I am pleased with the quality.  As with the sound, I didn't have any problems. Even without all the ""bells and whistles"", the show is worth purchasing this set.",1252454400,7,2994,4.74274661508704
1883879,4,B00009L502,"It was very nice to see an affordable (extremely affordable) release of WISEGUY season 1.  I was a big fan of WISEGUY during its initial run on CBS in the late 80's, although I did not start watching until the second season.  I did catch the Proffit arc 2 years later, when it aired on CBS late night.  Now I have just seen the Steelgrave arc for the first time.  I have heard about the Nights in White Satin issue but never having seen the original I didn't have an attachment to it.  I decided to see what the deal was and found video of the sequence on line with the original music.  Now, some reviews have stated that the replacement music is generic, I suppose that is correct if you call it generic WISEGUY music as it is taken from the theme of the show.  Honestly I thought the original version was a bit overdone but I do prefer that original versions be left intact.

This brings me to my point.

It boggles my mind that music companies or artist or whomever is responsible get in the way of the original music being kept on older TV series (why does this never happen with movie releases).  It would seem to me an excellent opportunity for record companies, artists, whomever to get some cheap if not free advertising.  Just imagine an extra on the DVD release of WISEGUY that lists all the original music used and where it could be found for purchase.  Just think how many people would buy a copy of Nights in White Satin if the song had been kept intact on the show and an extra like this had encouraged them to do so.  Would this not make the record companies, artist, whomever money.  It would probably increase the sales of the DVD and thus send more people to buy the song and so on and so forth.  Sorry for the ranting but I just think this would work.

The arc where I first encountered an amazing actor named Kevin Spacey and my eyes first feasted on the 100% woman that was Joan Severence.  William Russ' awesome Roger Lococco, as well as the rest of the usual suspects Jonathan Banks, Lifeguard, and of course Ken Wahl.  Yeah, it's a bummer there's no Moody Blues, and I was expecting some minutes trimmed here and there, but I'm almost done with the Profitt arc and I swear, there were even a few scenes that I'd never even seen originally on TV( and I'd seen the reruns a few times thanks to my now dead VCR). If the music thing is really that distracting, I'll cue up 'Nights' on the old iPod and listen to it while Vinnie and Sonny stare at each other. Good times.  Can't wait til Season 2 comes out.

-Price is MUCH more affordable (It's $9.99 on Amazon for the complete first season, whereas the previous releases were around $40 for each half of the 1st season)
-Release is indeed the entire 1st season (the previous releases split it in half, with one DVD set of Steelgrave, and another DVD set of Profitt)
-""Knights in White Satin"" song has still been replaced in the Steelgrave finale (it was replaced with the same instrumental music in the original DVD as well)
-The song originally used in the first part of the Mel Profitt arc as Vinnie and Roger arrive at the yacht party was substituted with generic music on the original release, but in this DVD, that particular song HAS BEEN RESTORED!
-The prints used appear to be the same remastered prints from the original release, but they don't look as sharp (in fact, they look fuzzier) simply because there is more compression and probably a lower bit rate being used in the disc authoring (they have placed 5 episodes each on Discs 1 and 2, and 6 episodes each on Discs 3 and 4)
-The audio is Mono, compared to the 5.1 soundtracks on the original release
-No extras whatsoever (the originals had audio commentaries, interviews with much of the cast, and some bonus stand-alone episodes from other seasons)
-The discs each come in black envelopes held in place in a snapper case
-Menus are static (originals featured video), but they have a great selection of music from the opening of the ""New Blood"" episode, and have the episodes listed as part of Vinnie's ""file""
-The series' pilot was featured in 1 complete part (as originally aired) on the original release, but is split into 2 parts in this DVD set (and it's a weird break, not at the halfway point but much later).  The second part opens immediately without any credits
-Chapters have been added to the episodes (the original Steelgrave set didn't have any) but the chapter breaks are not at the commercials

While I haven't watched each episode yet to determine if there are any glitches with the audio/video, my initial observations are that it's a good set considering you get all of the excellent 22 1st season shows (counting the pilot as 2 parts) for a very low price, and they look good even upconverted on a 46-inch HDTV as I viewed them.  However, if you already own the first DVD sets, I see no reason here for an upgrade, unless you want the original song featured in the 1st Mel Profitt episode which is now intact, or unless you want to have the entire first season all contained in 1 box (don't sell off your original sets, though).",1251417600,75,2998,4.63653483992467

You can still find copies of that ep with KNIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN on the web, ebay, etc - but what a shame not to have it here - what a shame.

Ken Wahl made the great anti-hero. His somber character drove this show. You got caught up into it and for me, that why I like good TV.

I have been waiting so long for the Dead Dog story arc, that now I'm no longer interested, but it's not because the delay of the DVD. It's because of the missing original music, the lack of special features, and the lack of regard and respect, from the studios and the owners of the TV show.

1883905,3,B00009L502,"There isn't any doubt that Wiseguy was great television--not just good, but GREAT television.  What you had was a combination of actors and writers literally at the best of their respective games.  Ken Wahl was brilliant--he gave both physical presence and a conflicted soul to Vinnie Terranova.  Wahl, along with Jonathan Banks as the hangdog Frank McPike and Jim Byrnes as Dan Burroughs (aka Lifeguard) formed a holy trinity of sorts as this arc went on; with Vinnie and McPike butting heads early, but developing a strong respect and liking for each other as it went on.  There also isn't enough that can be said about Stephen Cannell's writing throughout the arc.  This may well have been his Magnum Opus (I mean, really--compared with The A-Team?  21 Jump Street?  Silk Stalkings?).  Plus, that this was the series that introduced the ""arc""--taking the nine episodes to tell the complete tale (which has evolved now to telling stories over a whole season with many series) revolutionized series television.

  Still, the heft of this arc comes from the great Ray Sharkey.  In retrospect, it seems typical that a man this good at his art was as consumed as he was off-camera.  For those who only know Sharkey from his magnificent turn as the loyal, dangerous (and ultimately paranoid) gangster Sonny Steelgrave, I've got two words for you--""The Idolmaker"".  Find a copy of this film (1981, I believe).  Sharkey had a touch of greatness about himself, truly.

  But again, there were stunning performances throughout this arc--Dennis Liscomb's snarky accountant Sid Royce, Annette Benning's turn as the undercover (with Royce) operative (Yeah, they shouldn't have used her name on the liner), Joe Dallesandro's Pat ""The Cat"" Patrice--who thought he had Sonny boxed in until Sonny sprung that surprise on him in ""The Marriage Of Heaven And Hell"", and Eric Christmas' Harry the Hunchback...this was a set where everyone connected was at the absolute pinnacle of their game, and it showed through the whole set of episodes.

  It is unfortunate, however, that SOMEONE dropped the ball on ""No One Gets Out Of Here Alive"".  Forget that the episode is basically Vinnie and Sonny--having been exposed to each other as betrayers--are dealing with the ramifications both legal and emotional (The emotional results on Vinnie don't come up until ""White Noise"" in Season 2) of the fallout, leading to Sonny realizing what lay ahead for him...to not have ""Nights In White Satin"" as the background music is just WRONG.  Of course, it sets up a situation where SoundWorks releases a 2nd Edition of this arc and advertises the original music on the cover--think people who got ripped the first time wouldn't get the second edition?

  But--save the massive disappointment of not having Justin Heyward's voice in the finale of this arc--this is just incredibly brilliant television.",1171584000,6,2868,5.0747863247863245

1883908,1,B00009L502,"Foolishly, I trusted that the term ""complete"" when applied to arcs and/or seasons meant just that. It doesn't--at least not to Cannell and company. Those who loved this ahead-of-its-time series will be disappointed to find that the pivotal moment of the Sonny Steelgrave arc--the confrontation between Sonny and Vinnie with the classic ""Nights in White Satin"" playing over the scene--is gone. What's left is an edited version of the scene with canned music. The production company claims that it would cost too much to include the song. But pinching pennies didn't stop them from charging more for this set of the Steelgrave arc than most production companies charge for an entire season of an hour-long drama. To give the illusion that you're getting your money's worth, the producers of this and the Mel Profitt boxed set sometimes include only one or two episodes on a disk just to bulk up the set. Episodes are also out of sequence. Both sets include stand-alone episodes from later in the series that have nothing to do with these arcs and omit stand-alone episodes that continue these story lines. From the reviews I've read, it seems that later sets in the series are even lower in quality.

I recently watched a biography of Stephen Cannell in which he talked about his love of writing, etc., and dedication to his work. That's hard to believe. ""Wiseguy"" was the series that gave him the critical acclaim he supposedly craved, and the ""Nights in White Satin"" scene was one of its most creative moments. But when it came time to issue the series with the class it deserved, the decisionmakers for this release opted to slash that beautiful scene and throw in a hodgepodge of unrelated episodes just to save a little $$ here and make a few extra $$ there. How sad for them--and for the fans.

At Best Buy (in-store) this set costs $27, so I was drawn between finally being able to see more highly anticipated episodes, some with apparent problems, at a great price (what's up with the Amazon price?) (Is Best Buy selling sets with known problems at a discount? I would not think so), or waiting........and possibly paying more.  So another batch arrived, and I could no longer wait.  Good news: I have no problems whatsoever with any of the discs/episodes.  Disc One Episode 3 comes through clear, without any shuddering images or sound.  Ken's commentary on the Bonus Disc can be turned off and on from the remote control, or turned on on-screen under Set Up, althought the only way to turn it off is by re-starting from the Main Menu or switching back to 2.1 or 5.1 audio (This feature should have a simple on-off selection prompt).  I do not know if improved Sets have been issued (or how one would be able to tell, and could someone verify this) with the problems corrected, or if my region-free player overcomes the reported problems (That would be a inexcusable manufacturing coding glitch if that is the cause of the reported problems), or if, with the Bonus Disc, the commentary on-off is just problematic for others.  (Update: I have since been able to test the discs on a Region 1 player:  No problems!)  My only wish would be to have the ability to have Captions, as there are times when the sound quality and authentic speech are not as clear as I would like.

 Wiseguy was one of the best crime dramas of the late eighties/early nineties with strong lead and supporting characters,great writing, and great guest star casting.
 A lot of reviewers seem to have a problem with Studioworks replacing some of the music.
 You know what ? Although I prefer that the original music was included,I watched Wiseguy for the stories, not the music(I have cds for that).
 Is it a big distraction-I don't think so,because I just glad that this series is on dvd(because it sure ain't in syndication).
 Anyway, this series started out with the Steelgrave arc,and sets up the series, by letting Vinnie Terranova out of prison and Vinny working his way into the Steelgrave mob.
 Ray Sharkey gives the performance of his career in the role of mob leader Sonny Steelgrave, and watch for Annette Benning in one of her early roles.
 This set offers commentaries that give you an insight to the series by Steven Cannell and Ken Wahl as well as others).
 So if you're a fan of great crime drama, I recommend this set.",1108425600,4,1106,4.723958333333333
1883917,2,B00009L502,"Studioworks oversight of the missing 'setup' feature on the bonus disc is simply inexcusable. However, Tony Mills, who is the account executive at SW sent me this response about a possible replacement...

Thank you for purchasing Wiseguy: Between the Mob and a Hard Place. We have received your correspondence regarding the box set.

We apologize for any inconvenience and will gladly send replacements.

Please email info@studioworksent.com with your mailing information including phone number. Your replacement should arrive within 3-4 weeks.

Sincerely,

StudioWorks Entertainment

Hopefully, there won't be any technical 'oversights' on the replacement copies.

After reading some of the other reviews, hopefully I can answer a few of the questions other fans have posted here.

The 'official' story behind the first 15 minutes of ""A Rightful Place"" is that the original master tape was in extremely poor condition. What is on the disc now is the best that Studioworks could do as far as cleaning it up.

Yes, the 'music arc' was to come after the 'garment district arc', but due to all of the copyrights that have to be obtained to keep the music in those episodes, SW decided to release that box set last, so that no legal issues hold up the release date.

No word yet on whether or not those rights were obtained.

1883918,1,B00009L502,"Despite music omissions, I bought the earlier 3 volumes of this fantastic show and enjoyed them immensely, particularly the first 2 sets, which had some great extras.  It was all downhill from there, as this set was vomited out of the factory and onto the store shelves by Cannell Productions and Studioworks!

As others have pointed out, disc 1/episode 3 has practically unwatchable video due to poor compression, and disc 4 has no option for show only audio, you are stuck with Ken Wahl's audio commentary and nothing else.  Even Ken Wahl must have been frustrated by this when he got his comp set, as the 2 episodes on the set are 2 of his most favorite, and even he can't watch them without listening to himself talk over it!

The only good thing about this set is disc 3, which has the great Washington, DC story arc.  However, Cannell messed that up, too, as the opening title credit sequence features the one from the prior storyline, whereas I clearly remember that the DC episodes had a title sequence featuring characters from that arc!

And finally, more music has been replaced, as Ken Wahl HIMSELF points out on his commentaries!

What a cheap, shoddy job--I will not be fooled into buying further volumes of this series (and there are supposedly 2 more to come!) I will be sticking to my own VHS tapes instead!

(And by the way, I've read on Studioworks' own site that the manufacturers'suggested retail price was something like $39.99, so I'm not sure how other sites are charging more for it)",1106092800,49,1508,4.664150943396226

There are references to Vinnie's involvement with the record company in the first episode on this set of DVDs, but it leaves a new viewer (my wife) wondering what's really going on.

You might expect this from a burned copy but not an official release!

  The two bonus episodes don't have the option of viewing without Ken Wahl's commentary,which while entertaining is surely a serious oversite.

  These Wiseguy episodes may not have the depth or revolutionary impact of season one, but they are still streets ahead in terms of performance,writing and production values than pretty much anything around at that time.

No wonder people are downloading copies of everything off the 'net for free. If this is what you get for your hard earned cash then I have no sympathy for the recording industry crybabies.

The 3rd episode on disc 1 is just horrible quality. It's as if someone burned an old VHS recorded copy onto a DVD. I can deal with that though.

Where I'm most angered is the 4th disc with two stand alone episodes with commentary by Ken Wahl. I don't mind commentary. When it's optional. I can find no set-up option on this disc to watch the episodes without the commentary. I'd love to watch these episodes and be able to hear the dialog. And I can't in the commentary mode. On all other discs in this series there is a set-up option to turn optional commentary on or off. Not on disc 4 in this set though. Hell, even disc 1 in this particular set has a set-up to turn commentary on or off.

1883927,4,B00009L502,"Okay, the White Supremacy arc isn't the greatest arc. But it does have some great moments. Vinnie and Frank cementing their friendship, which began so hesitantly in the Profitt arc, is terrific. The bad guys aren't as likable in this arc, but maybe it's fun now and then to have someone to gleefully boo and hiss at.

 The Rag Trade arc is great for any number of reasons. The tortured trio of Beckstead, Raglin, and McPike show us with their nightmares of longlasting guilt that Vinnie isn't alone -- in fact he has it pretty easy... Jerry Lewis hams it up fine, and Ron Silver's always good. Stanley Tucci's versatility always amazes me. This is a classic textbook case of Murphy's Law; it should've been a cut-and-dried case that Vinnie could easily tie up; after all he'd been brought in by one of the principals and the crime boss was all eagerness in believing his cover if no other reason than his mom's recent marriage to Don Aiuppo. But step by step everything that can go wrong does, the arc ends with most of the principals dead and the ones that survive are broken. It's almost Shakespearean in its tragedy.

 The standalones are a lot of fun. It's wonderful to see the characters and what they're like when they're off duty, although it seems that Frank McPike is NEVER off duty in his own mind. However this is where the shortcomings of the DVD set become apparent. Again the music has been changed -- McPike's murder of the jukebox in ""Stairway"" is never as effective without ""Hit the Road, Jack"" triggering (pardon the pun) his ire. Ken Wahl's commentary seems limited to griping about the guy playing the doctor or the network itself. I'd have liked to hear more about other stuff such as how the money went from being carefully shrink-wrapped to completely unwrapped and back to shrink-wrapped again over a few scenes or how they managed to tilt that chair up against the fridge without killing anybody...or for that matter what the weather was like in Vancouver since there's snow on the ground and steam coming from everyone who breathes. ""White Noise"" is great because it's good to see Sonny again, albeit with a bad perm, but don't buy Vinnie's casual brush-off of the ghost; Sonny will haunt Vinnie again next season. ""Romp"" I have little to say about; it's a pointless episode written to fill a slot as far as I can see, and the most interesting thing about ""Reunion"" -- aside from the incredibly stupid woman cop whose last great act of defiance ranks right up there with the stupid Klingon in Star Trek III -- is the fact that the lovable dufus Mooch is the same guy in ""Where's the Money"" who threateningly towers over Frank McPike and commits the capital sin ""do you know you have your hand on me?""

 I confess to wishing there had been more special features -- an interview with Stanley Tucci or Jerry Lewis would've been great. I resent that we STILL don't have subtitles. But I'm going to keep buying these half-season box sets because I'll take my Wiseguys any way I can get them.",1090540800,23,3012,4.599627560521415
1883928,4,B00009L502,"I got hooked on Wiseguy when it was a late-night staple on CBS 1989ish. After seeing all the garbage TV shows released on DVD I sent many an e-mail to Stephen Cannell's website asking if and when Wiseguy would be released on DVD.  I was thrilled when I saw the Steelgrave Arc released and was hoping that it was not just a one time experiment. The first 2 sets were great. The interviews with Johnathan Banks and Stephen Cannell in the first set along with Kevin Spacey, William Russ & Joan Severance's in the second set were a terrific bonus treat for any fans of the show (or especially fans of Kevin Spacey).
The Mel Profitt Arc was released four months after the Steelgrave Arc and when nothing else was released four months later, I guess they figured: Thats all the buying fans would be interestred in. As the other reviews stated, it was definetly a let down going from the Millionare Mob Boss of Atlantic City (Ray Sharkey as Sonny Steelgrave) and the Billionaire, International Drug & Weapon's Contractor (Kevin Spacey as Mel Profitt) to the small time White Supremacy Group ""The Pilgrims of Promise"". Yeah Vinny's brother was killed but I guess they didn't think past those first 2 guys and were trying to keep it simple. It was still great story telling for broadcast tv at that time and I especially enjoyed the suspenseful ""Revenge of the Mud People"" where Vinny is wrongfully arrested for murdering a cop and the local police pull a Rodney King on him, while Vince is cut off from McPike and the Lifeguard.
The short four-story arc is a good appetizer to the brilliant Garment story with Jerry Lewis, Ron Silver and Stanley Tucci. Even though most of it was without Ken Wahl, the show never misses a beat. Thats because the catalyst isn't Vinny or his replacement John Raglin, it's the brilliant Jerry Lewis. Watching him struggle to hold on to what's left of his little piece of the 7th Avenue Garment District is powerful and is probably the best pure performance of the series. Great Wiseguy suspense and suprises.(However the finale was way too easy. I guess Joel Surnow was saving something for ""24"").
THE BIG BONUS on this set is a great return by Ray Sharkey as Sonny Steelgrave. While Vinny is in a rehab center healing his leg, he is mistakenly thrown in the Psyche Ward. There he is  drugged, abused by the staff and has a nightly hallucination of Sonny. It's a great ""What If?"" when Sonny torments Vince about his betryal, and dual identity. One of the few episodes I could never tape when the show was rebroadcast on WGN and Court TV in the last few years.
Well worth the $60 MSRP. Four more VHS Tapes in the trash. Thanks guys, looking forward to the return of Don Iuoppo when he and his stepson Vinnie Terranova take back New York. (Due out December 2004).
Will they release the ""Washington Arc"" (The revenge of Admiral Stryken), the ""Stranger in a Small Town Arc"" (the Return of Roger Loccoco), or even the regrettable Steven Baeur era?

1883929,5,B00009L502,"For a objective review some perspective is needed here. The First Season of Wiseguy (Steegrave/proffitt arcs)was some of the  most brilliant,well written and intense television ever produced and clearly difficult to follow up,therefore it's easy to see this half of the second season as inferior in quality, but thats not entirely fare.

At the end of the Proffitt arc Vinnie,completely burned out and psychologically traumatised resigned as a deep cover agent from the OCB. Season 2 opens with him taking stock of his life in his old neighbourhood and when his brother, father Pete is murdered, he begins to suspect and investigate a crusading white supremacist group and is again undercover for the OCB.This is a short story arc of some 4 episodes and of course cannot match the character development of previous arcs over twice as long. This first story line is good and should be seen as a transitional plot for the development of the always brilliant Ken Wahl character.

The second part of this boxset focuses on a struggling garment manufacturers attempts to fight off a powerful and sociopathic mobster Rick Pinzolo , played exceptionally well by Stanley Tucci. Jerry Lewis and Ron Silver are outstanding as the father and son garment traders Eli and David Sternberg. Unfortunately at the start of this arc Ken Wahl suffered an accident and had to be written out, but i think the writers did a splendid job in introducing a replacement character in the shape of conflicted OCB agent John Raglin, very well played by Anthony Dennison.
Perhaps the bad guys in season 2 lack the charisma of Sonny Steelgrave and Mel Proffitt but this is exceptional,engrossing well written drama none the less, and well worth purchasing.

1883930,4,B00009L502,"Granted, this was my all-time favorite show; even I have to question the quality of the KKK arc presented here. On the other hand, I thought the Rag Trade arc shone brightly despite the lack of Wahl's participation. Ron Silver and a surprisingly effective Jerry Lewis create the tension and dramatic payoffs we expect from the series, but Tucci steals the show with a deliciously slimy turn as the villain. I loved this arc! The KKK arc has its moments; Fred D. Thompson is imperious as ever, and we get the first real glimpses of the underbelly of the world Vinnie left behind to go deep cover. Other than that, however, this was as bad as this brilliant show would get, imho.",1085616000,9,677,4.557377049180328

The arc involving the garment district had a great bad guy in Stanley Tucci, but Ken Wahl's leg injury took him out of the series and prompted a radical re-write of the script. Enter a new agent. I could not get into it and abandoned the show for a few weeks.
The ""Pilgrims of Promise"" arc was weak as well. Fred Thompson is a good actor but not enough of a draw to fill the void left by Kevin Spacey or Ray Sharkey. If you contrast this with the first season of Wise Guy there is such a huge dropoff in the villians.

1883933,3,B00009L502,"K, this rates as one of TV's greatest moments and, in particular, Sharkey's Steelgrave is aces to anyone else's mobster, Tony Soprano inclusive.
The grit was ahead of its time and belongs in the same era as, say, a Bochco show, David E. Kelley, ""Oz"", or ""24"". But it also had the trademark humor of Cannell that was in his other shows such as ""Rockford Files"" and the otherwise banal ""A-Team.""
I am pleased as punch to know that all the arcs will see the laser light of day, BUT!!!!, I am in agreement with much of the rancor here:
1) The denouement of this debut arc was perfect as aired, IMHO. It needs that tandem of Young Rascals then Moodys to fit the mood flux of that scene. That dubbed song is an insult! Further the box set shoulda had a caveat, let the seasoned Wiseguy buyer beware, I mean they altered THE crucial moment, fer cryin' out loud!!!! And to you who sez listen to the ""Days of Future Passed"" while watching it? Aww c'mon! It ain't JUST the song. As Wahl says on the bizarre taciturn commentary (often sounds like he's answering questions from a film class...and making odd wise cracks, to boot), the long dramatic camera angles were truncated alongside the song, as well, drastically lobotomizing the mood and feel of the scene. In an uncharacteristic PC moment, Wahl sez it works, too. Bull hockey. I feel cheated.
2) So, releasing WG in arcs seems a no-brainer, which must mean that someone didn't, like, USE they brains to price the product. It should have been commensurate with other sets out there. Say, in the upper 20s, low 30s. I bought the whole season 1 of ""24"" at the same time as WG and paid the same for both, even tho list for the latter is 10 simoleons less.
3) Chintzy on the extras, I thought and yes, basics like no subtitles, no indexing.
4) No explanation in the booklet as to what happened to the principals (Sharkey died of AIDS, Wahl broke his neck in a bike wreck, etc.)
5) Anyone notice that [...] is a ghost and has 404'd?
To think, I was given The Simpsons ""Treehouse of Horror"" which is only 4 episodes long itself. What IS going on in DVD-land folks? Shaft the loyal consumers?",1075161600,6,2130,4.436224489795919

For those of us who saw and taped the original episodes, the new score jsut doesn't achieved the same emotional effect.

1883936,5,B00009L502,"Okay, the packaging of WISE GUY is ticking a few off.  In the day when they are releasing whole years of a series in a block on DVD at once, WISEGUY is optioning (more money honey) to package the WISEGUY in the Arcs.  They were conceived to follow one storyline for around 13 episodes.  The first of the arcs was Sonny Steelgrave (Ray Sharkey).  Sharkey gives his roll of a lifetime performance as the mobster Vinnie Terranova is assigned to investigate.  Vinnie comes from the background where mobs were the norm, so his gaining Steelgrave's confidence is not hard.  Keeping it is another matter.  Steelgrave is paranoid when anything is mentioned about the FBI and sees agents lurking everywhere.  Soon Vinnie is getting sucked into actually liking the man he is sent to bring down.
Keeping Vinnie on the even keel and reminding him what he is there to do is Frank McPike Jonathan Banks and his check-in contact Lifeguard or ""Uncle Mike"" Jim Byrnes (Highlander).  The writing is crisp and incisive, no black and whites drawn in characters, just a thousand shades of grey.
Forewarned, music changes were made due to contacts which hurt the anticipation of people who know the series well...ie...NO Nights in White Satin ending.  Was back in the days artists were thrilled to see the songs used - now it's show me the money...sigh!
It's still a brilliant bit of work that was way ahead of it's time.",1072483200,30,1399,4.720164609053498
1883937,4,B00009L502,"I haven't seen these episodes in about 15 years, so it took me one or two hours to get re-accustomed to the mid-80s style of TV.  Once the story gets rolling, however, I found that I enjoyed it as much as I remembered.  Ray Sharkey's performance is extraordinary.
Like other reviewers here, I was waiting for ""Nights in White Satin"" in the last episode, and until I checked here, I was wondering if perhaps I remembered it wrong.  Well, it's a relief to find out my memory hasn't deteroriated yet.  However, it's a shame that music rights issues still cause so many problems.
I wouldn't be too quick to blame the Moody Blues, or any other artist.  Very often the artists have nothing to do with these decisions.  Also, the producers very likely wanted to include the original songs, but the licensing demands may have made the cost of production prohibitive...yes?
In the last few years, especially since DVD was introduced, film and TV productions routinely negotiate the music rights at the time of production, so that it doesn't become an issue in future video releases.  Since this wasn't a practice in earlier days, we unfortunately get stuck with compromises like this one.
Frankly, I always thought the use of ""Nights in White Satin"" was somewhat bizarre and incongruous, since it's such a romantic piece... but that's doubtless why I remember the original scene so well.  I guess I'm lucky that's the only change that I notice (it is pretty glaring).
From what I've read it's not the creative people (like Stephen Cannell or the Moody Blues) who put up these roadblocks.  There are plenty of greedy ""suits"" who control the rights, and a director or producer may not be able to say ""boo"" to them.  (They're probably the kind of people Sonny Steelgrave hangs out with...)
For me it's worth it to have these shows in my collection.  It's fun to revisit the days when a story ""arc"" was something new (it's become the rule today).  The writing and acting are first-rate, and as for the music... well, the original theme is still catchy!",1069632000,10,2039,4.7126760563380286
1883938,4,B00009L502,"I first watched ""Wiseguy"" during the Mel Profitt/Kevin Spacey arc, and had never seen these episodes. My impressions back then were that they were awesome.
Fifteen years of build-up, and y'know, they ARE pretty damn good.
Taken as a mini-series, the Steelgrave arc blows most mid-80's TV out of the water. HBO series, like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Six Feet Under"", build their tension and craft their storylines around 12 or 13 episodes ""arcs"" to this very day.
While the whole Mob ""behind-the-scenes"" stuff has been done to death by pretty much everybody, nobody has captured a relationship like Sonny and Vinnie on film.
You will find sympathy for the murderer, and the betrayer in this case is the ""good guy"". Your own feelings will be mixed, echoing Vinnie's. Nifty accomplishment for a ""crime melodrama TV series"", don't ya think? The writing and plotting here is top-notch.
Ray Sharkey is justifiably celebrated for his role here, and Ken Wahl clearly is doing the role of his career (as it would prove to be). Jonathan Banks and Ed Byrnes offer flawless support.
Caveats are few. Pretty much every female role is awful, and often embarassing. Every line from ""Gina Augustina's"" mouth is flat-out terrible, for example. Beginning with her name. And yes, the 80's hairstyles are a hoot. They are the reason widescreen television was invented.
Reading about ""Nights In White Satin"", I'm saddened that it was not included. I agree, it must have been something to see/hear. It's time for these ""music rights"" issues to be settled. If a film was butchered and sold without the creator's permission, the performing arts community would be up in arms. Now we must slice up the soundtrack because certain greedy individuals need even more money? Listen, you agreed once to have it in the film. Leaving it in will only sell you MORE records, not less. Enough already.
Back to ""Wiseguy"", yes the price is debatably elevated, but the entertainment value?
No question. Worth every penny.",1067990400,5,1976,4.954819277108434
1883939,3,B00009L502,"I have read most of the other comments, and I wanted to mention the three biggest disappointments with this particular set.
First, as has been mentioned, is the price/format.  The first two DVD's have four hours of shows, the third has three, and it seems like the fourth has even less.  THEN they are going to put out the Profitt Arc later on.  I think that they could've prepared the whole first season on six DVD's and left it at that.  Obviously the technology is there as many other series have condensed a lot more material onto two or three DVD's.
Secondly, I was fairly disappointed that there were no captions/subtitles.  This is a very basic DVD function that I generally assume will be available.  I don't hear as well as I used to, and I usually enjoy a show much more with the captions on.
Third, as has been mentioned, is the OBVIOUS omission of the ""Nights in White Satin"" piece in the No One Gets Out of Here Alive episode.  What were they thinking!?!  Frankly, I believe that they ruined one of the most powerful and moving scenes ever shown on TV, and clearly several others agree with me.
If I was in charge of future DVD productions for Wiseguy, I'd pull my head out of my butt and remaster that episode for inclusion in a future set.  I'd also make sure that all of the episodes had captioning.  I'm sure that the original TV shows did, so why not the DVD's?
Will I buy future sets?  Probably, because I really liked the show and I am looking forward to the Music Business Arc.  I don't think they can butcher the future shows any worse than they already did by leaving out ""Nights"".
I hope that any future DVD's for Wiseguy and any other TV series will be truer to the original visions than this particular set.",1065312000,8,1733,4.398119122257054
1883940,3,B00009L502,"I loved this show and have awaited the DVD release impatiently for years.  Now that it is here, I have mixed feelings.  It's great to watch the shows at will, but I must agree with the other disappointed fans that the missing music REALLY has a negative impact on the final product.
The most obvious is the missing Moody Blues song.  The scene loses much of its emotional resonance.  This scene is the culmination of the entire story arc and has lasting repercussions in the following stories.  The new placeholder music just does not work.  I wish I could state otherwise.
The other missing music is also annoying.  The scenes with Aldo Baglia singing along with the radio in the final episode were much more ironic & just plain funnier as originally presented.
One would think that it's obvious how important soundtrack music can be.  I believe the success of ""The Sopranos"" and even Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" is largely due to the soundtrack score.  Both of these examples--and Wiseguy--benefit from the use of popular music.  Perhaps because mob movies have become part of the fabric of American folklore and pop music places it in that context.
 I have read online that it was a choice between changing the music and not putting out the DVD.  The music rights were so expensive as to make the DVD production cost prohibitive.  If that is the case, I'm glad the DVD exists, but I'm saddened that it must exist in this castrated form.  I hope the money savings is worth the loss of artistic integrity.  Maybe someone who's never seen Wiseguy before can be a more objective commentator.
I hope there will not be compromises like this in the future Wiseguy DVD releases, because I'd still like to own them all.",1063670400,7,1716,4.7114093959731544
1883941,1,B00009L502,"When Wiseguy first aired, I was hooked from the first episode.
Over the years, I often wondered if that show would ever appear again.
Now that it has, I almost wish it hadn't. And I'll give you two reasons why:
1. The price. The first installment is priced at $52.49 -- a respectable amount for an entire season of a TV show. But a ridiculous sum given that it's just for PART of the first season. The second half of the first season will cost another $52.49, bringing the total to well over $100 for a single season. To my knowledge, only The X-Files has commanded a pricetage that high per season. Wiseguy, although a great TV show, isn't worth over $100 for a single season.
2. The controversy regarding Nights in White Satin. I really, really detest it when DVDs are released that differ from how they originally aired (hear that Spielberg and Lucas?). I almost bought the complete Gumby and Pokey DVD set until I discovered the original music was missing. As much as I enjoyed Gumby and Pokey as a kid, I couldn't bring myself to shell out a dime for lame DVDs that don't contain the original musical score.
The same goes for Wiseguy.
The fact that Wiseguy doesn't include Nights in White Satin when it originally contained that crucial song is enough on its own to make me not buy this set. But when you combine that with the outrageous price to buy the entire first season, well, that clinches it.
I'll save my money.
And I hope you will, too. It would serve the producers of this disappointing DVD set right to see it bomb big time.",1063670400,32,1540,4.445229681978798
1883942,5,B00009L502,"I can't believe they omitted Nights in White Satin for the powerhouse finish of the Steelgrave Arc.  It easily doubled the impact of an already riveting scene.  I'm assuming it's a legal thing, but what a very large loss.  I'd almost buy another set if they put it back in.
  The rest of the DVD set is wonderful.  I hope they do the other seasons.  But this was the best one.",1063670400,,376,4.211267605633803
1883943,5,B00009L502,"I don't remember this series on TV. It has the feel of a Canadian series shot in Vancouver as it was. Vancouver is a nice background that apparently gives the impression of being New Jersey, Brooklyn and Atlantic City (with some inserted AC shoreline footage.
I thought it was worth a shot and Wow! was it worth it. While it is only slightly dated, this is one fine dramatic series, especially the Sonny Steelgrave arc. Don't miss it!",1062892800,3,434,4.576923076923077
1883944,2,B00009L502,"Firstly, I've got to say that WISEGUY was, and still is, THE BEST American series ever produced (pretending the fourth season doesn't exist, natch:).
I have been waiting for about 15 years for this to come out on first VHS, then DVD.  I was sooooo psyched to hear it would finally come out.  This was going to be the thing that finally made me go buy a DVD player.
Now, I'm not sure I'll even buy it.
I want to thank ""Katie from MN,"" ""Wendy A Comeau,"" and ""A Viewer from Dallas"" for the heads-up.
Until I scanned some of these comments, it never occured to me that the first set would only contain the first ARC, and not the first SEASON.  OR that they would throw two episodes on there that were from later in the series.  But most disappointing is what I read about them replacing some of the music from the original.  ""Nights in White Satin"" was written as if intended to be used in ""No One Gets Out of Here Alive.""  To this day, I have to fight to keep from crying anytime I happen to hear that song.  What on Earth gave the people responsible for the DVD the idea that it wasn't VITAL to keep ALL the elements in tact?!  What?  They didn't want to spring for the rights?!
Between the music and the partial season with eps out of place, what a thorough disappointment!  Especially considering the pains that were taken with the continuity of the show.  I expected much better.  You'd think that they'd give the fans who waited all this time and are willing to put out $$$ for this a bit more respect!
And now I have to rescind all the recommendations I made to friends and acquaintances to run out and buy this immediately.
I think maybe I'll just save up for a DVD-recorder and then burn my original VHS copies (from the original airing) to DVD.  There may not be any extras, but at least all the original stuff was there, and they'll be in order.
All in all it sounds like I'd be better off buying myself a season of STARGATE: SG-1 and waiting to see if they get a clue and eventually release a WISEGUY DVD set that gives the series the respect it deserves - not to mention the fans.

1883945,4,B00009L502,"This show is one of my all time favorites: because of the intensity of emotion and the bits of humor thrown in in just the right place.  I am glad to have them now in DVD format, rather than the copy of a copy of the tape of the original series from broadcast TV.  The images are lovely and clear.
The problems:
Changing the music was a MISTAKE!  The produceers needed to bite the bullet and bought the rights to Nights in White Satin, especially. Even if they did not, they could have found something more appropriate to replace it with, than generic mood music.  The facial close-ups in the final scenes that conveyed so much tension and unsaid emotion (and love) became tedious.  At the very least, they should have sought out music that carried a similar emotion and content to Nights in White Satin.  Aldo's burial scene is likewise made less edgy with the generic elevator music they put in his boombox.
Also, the menuing system is primitive, without a scene breakdown, so finding favorite scenes is a longer process than it should be.
I am still glad to get the clear versions of these shows, but I'll have to keep the originals in order not to lose the GREAT elements of the episodes.",1062201600,8,1192,4.49537037037037
1883946,4,B00009L502,"When I first saw DVD releases of TV shows Season this and Season that, I immediately thought of Wiseguy.  I have practically worn out my own (copied from TV) VHS tapes.
What was so unique about this show was the ARC aspect, giving the show new life approximately every 10 episodes by bringing in a new bad guy, like Ray Sharkey or then unknown Kevin Spacey.  The characters were given time to be explored and understood and in that respect, I don't think there has been a show done quite as well since. Not the least, is some great acting both by guests and Ken Wahl, the wiseguy himself.  Plus there is a nice ensemble group making up the Wiseguy team (McPike and the Lifeguard).
I can't wait for the rest of the series on DVD.",1062201600,,728,4.338235294117647

Wiseguy pretty much invented the story arc format(one story over a number of weeks),this made it possible to add real depth,subplot and character development, which is sadly lacking in so many other prime time shows.
 Ken Wahl was terrific as under cover FBI agent Vincent Michael Terranova, whose 'Wiseguy'cover, enabled him to infiltrate east coast organised crime.
 The series showcased some of the most memorable villains ever on TV and perfectly mirrored the late Eighties ethos of power,money and greed.... the Charasmatic,yet ultimately tragic mob boss Sonny Steelgrave (Ray Sharkey),the profoundly psychotic billionaire Mel Profit(Kevin Spacey)and the brilliantly vein and egocentric record company mogul Sir Winston Newquay(Tim Curry).This is a must buy for fans, or if you're new to it get it anyway, you won't regret it!",1060214400,3,980,5.614864864864865

The result is that present form leaves out important individual links as well as later arcs from the ones offered. The complete ""Wiseguy"" would be a must-buy purchase with several soon-to-be movie stars playing villain roles (including Kevin Spacy in a particular kinky one with Joan Severance as sister).
