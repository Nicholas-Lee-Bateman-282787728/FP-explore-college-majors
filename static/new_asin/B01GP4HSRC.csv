7764502,5,B01GP4HSRC,I rented and watched this movie last night and really enjoyed it. Seems that anything that Tom Hanks is involved in is always of high quality which is why I watched it to begin with since I hadn't heard much about it. This is an interesting story about our time and a love story mixed in. The movie is complete enough to keep your interest and the acting is of high quality. Makes me look forward to his next movie.,1471132800,,415,4.2

7764504,5,B01GP4HSRC,"Alan Clay is in crisis. Like a lot of folks over 40, his life has not turned out the way he thought it would.

The film opens with Alan performing his own version of Talking Heads Once in a Lifetime. He no longer has a beautiful house, car or wife. Just when were grooving to this comic sequence, Alan wakes up. Hes on board a plane bound for Saudi Arabia  a nightmare of a different sort.

German director Tom Tykwer wrote the script from the book by Dave Eggers, a novel about the 2000s financial crisis and the Great Recession. Tom Hanks, who worked with Tykwer on Cloud Atlas, portrays Alan Clay. He is perfect  as usual  taking us through Alans situation with heart, humor and authenticity. A Hologram for the King is much more accessible than Atlas  and thats all to the good.

Alan once led a company that outsourced their business. We catch a glimpse of this in one of the flashbacks that pepper his life with regret. He now works in sales, donning a super-cheerful persona to coax others into cooperation. Hes a smooth operator, but his technique isn't working like it should.

Alans team is stuck in a warehouse without access to food or Wi-Fi; the air conditioning fluctuates from almost to none. He overslept on his first day, missing a crucial appointment. Now the officials he should be meeting with are nowhere to be found. Theyre out of the country or at meetings in other cities  as insubstantial as the hologram program hes trying to deliver to the Saudi king. And hes discovered a scary, golf ball-sized lump on his back. Meanwhile, his boss is demanding results and delivering threats.

It isn't until Alan is forced to step outside of old habits that he starts to make progress.

Colors are vivid yet natural, with well-defined detail in Lionsgates 1080p transfer. Shot via digital camera and 35mm film, there appears to be no artificial filtering. Primarily filmed in Morocco with some exterior shots in Saudi Arabia, scenes vibrate with heat and rippling sand, and contrast state-of-the-art office complexes with construction that is alternately ghost-town deserted or rife with urban squalor. End sequences filmed underwater showcase aquatic life and seascapes. Its beautiful.

Cinematographer Frank Griebe, who also handled Tykwers Cloud Atlas, Run, Lola Run and Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, zooms in on facial details as well. Hanks Alan Clay is not as flashy as Forrest Gump, Captain Miller of Saving Private Ryan or Paul Edgecomb of The Green Mile, but he pulls us in. Alan wants to disappear, but we clearly see the anxiety behind the artifice. Its a subtle, but memorable performance.
The story maintains a strong sense of tension. Marooned in an alien zone, Alan knows enough about the culture to be afraid  very afraid from time to time. Like when his driver has to check the car for explosive devices every time they head out. Its not terrorism, the man explains. Nothing like that. The driver has been seeing a married woman and expects retaliation from her husband.

Hanks co-stars, newcomer Alexander Black (the driver) and Sarita Choudhury, are good and also beautifully filmed  but neither are Saudi. That struck an odd note.

A DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack distributes restrained immersion  theres only an occasional sound blast  faultless dialogue and a score by Tykwer and Johnny Klimek.

Bonus features include The Making of A Hologram for the King, From Novel to Screen: The Adaptation of A Hologram for the King, and Perfecting the Culture, with interviews from Tykwer, Hanks and other members of the cast and crew. There are no standouts, but we come away with a better understanding of the film and what they hoped to achieve.

Its not easy to film a story about an existential crisis without going over the top. Happily, theres no melodrama to be found here. And no easy answers to questions most will face in some way during their lifetime. Dont miss it.   Kay Reynolds",1471046400,11,3928,4.822652757078987
7764505,4,B01GP4HSRC,"Tom Hanks did a good job with this character. The movie and storyline however, are a little bizarre. This is sort of a PC tale for love and the Middle East.  Great scenery just the same.",1470787200,11,186,4.166666666666667

7764507,3,B01GP4HSRC,"""I think we should expect the unexpected."" Alan (Hanks) is a businessman who is struggling and who's life is falling apart. He is sent to Saudi Arabia in order to convince the king to use his company's technology. When he gets there it is not at all what he expected, and in the middle of the desert Alan begins to really discover who he is. This is a movie that isn't bad but really comes down to the fact that Tom Hanks is such a great actor that he carries the movie on his own. By that I mean that this movie isn't all that exciting and may not have been made if not for Hanks. He can turn a barely watchable movie into something much better than it should be just by his skills alone. Essentially his character spends his time waking up late and riding in a taxi only to be told that the king isn't here today. Over and over. The caliber of Hanks really adds depth and emotion to this character and makes the movie worth seeing. Very few actors can do that. Overall, an OK movie at best but Hanks makes this watchable and he is the real reason to watch this. I give it a B-.",1470182400,32,1079,4.09433962264151
7764508,5,B01GP4HSRC,"Tom Hanks is so good at bringing innocence and maturity to the same character.  He plays a divorced man whose job requires him to pitch a hologram idea to the king of Saudi Arabia, but runs into a lot of unexpected health and bureaucratic issues.  The movie is very clever in its subtlety as it shows the bad aspects of Saudi Arabian Islamic law, but without it being perceived as a strident attack on Saudi Arabia.  The Tom Hanks character has lots of misadventures which I often find more memorable for their oddity than laugh-out-loud hilarious, kind of like the quirky Ben Stiller comedy The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013), both of which movies are about mid-life crisis.  Theres an offbeat style to the Hologram movie in how Hankss character briefly remembers certain incidents from his past, done differently than your usual flashback scene.  Also, there are few people who can be as believable in the most wacky scenarios as Tom Hanks, like when he is at a wild party that is illegal according to Saudi laws, and finds himself in an awkward position with a seductive woman but balances the tension and comedy really well, and retains his innocence, reminding me of how he did that as Forrest Gump surrounded by seedy characters.  I like the way his romantic relationship with a lady late in the movie develops in a mature way, not your flashy love-at-first-sight glamor.  It is an unconventional romance and has some delicate things that Im sure were hard to figure out how to sensitively film, for which it has an R rating, but I think the rationale of the romance makes sense and has moral justification, and is discreetly portrayed on the screen within the context.  Part of the delicacy is that Saudi Arabia is suspicious of public male-female interaction but allows multiple wives, and Hankss love interest is claimed by a man who doesnt even live with her and claims her as property, so it doesnt count as adultery on Hankss part, in my judgment.  I like how the movie explores the meaning of life by letting you watch his misadventures and his debate about whether the place he lives or the person he loves is more important.  Watching this movie was a good experience for me.",1465603200,125,2194,4.690104166666667

7764529,4,B01GP4HSRC,"Must admit, i probably wouldn't have given the film a second glance but for the fact that much acclaimed actor
'Tom Hanks' plays the lead role  (He remains, in my view, one of the best around)
The story tells of washed-up salesman 'Alan Clay' who's life had hit the buffers at home', losing his wife and home,
now almost penniless...however he has a need to see that his daughter completes her education, which takes
financial commitment.
He is given one last chance to resurrect his career and financial well-being, he travels to Saudi-Arabia to sell a
holographic-teleconferencing-system to the Saudi Government.....not only will he struggle with the culture and
ways of the Saudi's he'll find tat actually getting an audience to to be far more demonstrate the technology difficult
and challenging than he could ever have imagined.
Among the diverse characters he'll interact with 'Yousef' (Alexander Black) a Saudi taxi-driver who is assigned to
'Alan' to get him to the places he needs to be.
He also comes into contact with a local practitioner 'Zahra' (Sarita Choudhury) who he meets because of a health
issue, unexpectedly the two hit-it-off over a period of time.
Will his business trip to the far-east be a success or will things just go from bad to worse for the struggling salesman ?
An unusual film in truth though tinged with much humour which is brought to the screen by the skills of Tom Hanks'
and the off-beat taxi-driver 'Yousef' in the main.
Though never an Oscar contender the film is in my opinion worth a viewing - maybe one to catch on a movie-channel.

7764563,3,B01GP4HSRC,"I hate to say it, but not my favorite Tom Hanks movie.  His past movies have created a living personality that might not be real, the nicest guy on Earth.  I will not say that.  Irrelevant.  He is an actor and he does a workmanlike job here.  Acting is fiction.  This movie has some heart, but the struggle was that of a salesman in the desert.  I guess it's my fault for creating a type cast earlier, and cannot shake him suddenly being a simple Capitalist, divorced and seeking a new mate.  Hanks fans may want him back with you-know-who, or lost in CAST AWAY or even in JOE V. VOLCANO.  The bridge movie was history and worked well.

7764567,2,B01GP4HSRC,"A Hologram for the King stars Tom Hanks as Alan Clay, a middle-aged, divorced American businessman who travels to Saudi Arabia hoping to sell King Abdullah a holographic telecommunications system. Nearly broke, Alan is depending on a big commission if the sale goes through. But the King delays seeing him for days, leaving him in a state of uncertainty in a strange land with unfamiliar customs. Alan has little to do but wait and hope.

Among the people Alan encounters as he waits for his audience with the King are his driver, Yousef (Alexander Black), who provides comic relief; Hanne (Sidse Babett Knudsen), a Danish consultant who knows where to find booze and loose women in the restrictive nation; and Zahra (Sarita Choudhury), a Saudi doctor.

Based on a novel by Dave Eggers, A Hologram for the King portrays a man out of his depth, worrying not only about his upcoming meeting but also about a mysterious growth on his back. He has plenty of time to take a hard look at his life, come to terms with the local culture, and realize that there are ways to live different from his own back in Iowa.

Writer/director Tom Tykwer has cast the movie well. Hanks Alan is likable, and we sympathize with him as he struggles with Saudi bureaucracy. The role suits the actor well but the script doesnt give him a lot to do other than look perplexed, frustrated, and mildly annoyed at being in limbo, not knowing when  or if  he will meet with the King. So the film fails to adequately engage us. There is little action and many sequences drag. Were it not for Hanks star power and charisma, the film would be forgettable.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include two featurettes: From Novel to Screen: The Adaptation of A Hologram for the King, and a behind-the-scenes making-of mini-documentary. A digital HD copy is included.",1471564800,,1831,4.70625
