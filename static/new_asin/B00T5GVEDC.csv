8700481,4,B00T5GVEDC,Beware if you were to buy this Tears for Fears video... it is Zone 2 pal or it might be Zone zero but none the less it's a pal not and ntsc which is very important if you have American DVD players that aren't capable of playing both ntsc and pal quite frankly I don't understand why they're still a difference! since everything is digital now everything should work unless Hollywood or the copyright owners deem it to be zoned for the eight different zones on the planet. this allows them to resell the same product if they so desire to. 8 different zones at different prices or they can just make it a Zone zero Universal play....,1490572800,,631,4.3559322033898304

Ironically, it arrived today.
The product is as advertised and I no longer want the refund I requested yesterday.

8700484,5,B00T5GVEDC,"This DVD compilation of Tears for Fears greatest hits is absolutely worth the price.  The DVD follows the order of the audio CD (which I have and is always at the ready in my car) from start to finish.  The videos for the older songs from The Hurting are bizarre.  It would be unfair though, to lower this rating as the songs themselves are classic and timeless.  Further, TFF  were still up and coming at the time and probably didn't have the money to invest in better production of their videos then.  The band doesn't get the recognition they deserve in my view.  The evolution of their music  from The Hurting to the Seeds of Love is evident and their growth and depth as artists during the entire period is admirable.  Separately, The Hurting, Songs from the Big Chair and The Seeds of Love are fantastic.  Together, as a whole body of work, they put TFF into an elite class of great artists of the 80s and early 90s.",1437177600,3,922,4.402366863905326
