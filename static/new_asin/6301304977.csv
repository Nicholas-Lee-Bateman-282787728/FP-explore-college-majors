325104,3,6301304977,"This Lucia is below La Stupenda's capabilities. Granted, Sutherland still had the coloratura technique, she had lost the golden voice. It's still  better than anyone around, but to someone who know what she's capable of,  it's a big decline.
So many fans would swear that the earlier 1982 Lucia  that Joan did for the met is the last word in bel canto singing..NO WAY.  (That 1982 was much better than this 1986) Lucia. Many fans don't know that  great as dame Joan was in 1982, it's a totally different voice twenty years  earlier. If 1982 was a 10 voice, then 1962 was a 10 x 2 voice. That how  much better she was 20 years ago. And she kept that shape until around 1976  and that spendid I Purtani that she and Pavorotti did for the Met. Then I  don't know what happened, because every year she got worse, and gradually  lost the steady voice that she had for so many decades.
If you really  wanted to hear what the Sutheland voice was like to earn the title of La  Stupenda, go get the ""Voice of Firestone"" tape, and the Bell  telephone hour tapes, and the ""Age of bel canto"" tape. These are  all 1961-1968..as prime as you can get. On the Age of bel canto tape,  listen to Sempre Libera, she attacks all the high notes with big brilliant  tones. The coloratura doesn't even seem hard for her. All she does is open  her mouth and all that lush sounds comes out, up to E flat above high C.  Unbelievable. I like the Semiramide aria even better, the fioratura is  fabulous and again she goes to top E flat. Then there's the Qui la voce.  Again, the voice is free and floating, the coloratura effortless as it  should be, and again she goes to high E flat.
In the Firestone and bell  telephone hour tape, Sutherland is also unbelievable. These tapes are also  from 1961 to 1968. And what a bell song Joan sang in a 1967 Bell telephone  hour selection. And in the Firestone one, a resounding Soldier tir'd that  even surpass the one she sang for her studio recording of Art of the Prima  donna. But the surprise highlight of those performance is a stunning Hamlet  mad scene from 1961 with coloratura that even makes this recording sound  tame, and she goes to high F in the Hamlet mad scene.
Anyway, anything  that Dame Joan did before the key year of 1977 will be nothing short of  stupendous. She continued to be valid until as late as 1982, but everything  after that is just not the Sutherland sound anymore.
I just don't  recommend this 1986 Lucia. If you have the basic recordings of Sutherland  but wanted a Lucia video, I recommend the 1982 Met Lucia, but that's still  not the true Sutherland sound. Just being honest.",966211200,11,2628,4.417536534446764
325105,3,6301304977,"Sutherland is a bit old in this ""revival"" performance... it's a bit tough to buy her as a young ingenue in love.  When she ""flits lightly"" across the stage, the rafters shake, y'know?
Appearance  aside, her voice isn't in its finest form, either.  Most of the opera she  seems to be warming up... however, once she gets to that pivotal mad scene  that's so famous, she seems to have finally warmed up, and that's what  pushes the performance above merely average.
The tenor in this opera,  Alfredo Kraus, is nothing short of fabulous, as always.  May he RIP.",945302400,32,558,4.622448979591836
325205,4,6301304977,"I'd like to list severals pros for recording this so late:
1)Sutherland had a lot of experience to use for this Lucia
2)Here she does more than just singing beautifully, she's acting well too!
Before I start with the cons I'd like to correct several reviewers who've shown how ignorant they truly are:
1)Sutherland didn't force Callas into retirement, Callas never officially retired!
2)Callas does NOT crack 25% of the high notes, whoever came up with this lie?
3)As for the bestselling Lucia that isn't bestselling now because everyone already has it... Does the person who wrote this notice that he's negating the ""fact"" he's trying to prove? The Sutherland-Lucia is magnificent. (The one from 1971) But, and I work in the business, it's not the bestselling Lucia of all ages, I dare say it's far too expensive. The cheaper early Lucia with Sutherland and Cioni outsells the later performance without any problem. As do the early Callas-performances on EMI.
Now to this DVD: I'm really sorry but IMHO La Stupenda sounds too old and worn out for young Lucy. Her high notes are edgy not glowing anymore. Still, it is a fabulous DVD, better late than never!",1073865600,5,1157,4.848484848484849
325206,5,6301304977,"First of all, I would like to dispel any notion that the readers of these reviews might acquire about Maria Callas's interpretation of Lucia.  If you haven't noticed, many of the other reviewers you see here produce every argument in the book why Sutherland sings the role better than Callas.  Why do they have to harp on it to such an extent if Sutherland were the undisputed queen of this role??  Both Callas and Sutherland are very individualistic singers, like apples and oranges, and it's impossible to make the claim that either's interpretation is superior to the other.
  One of the many indicators of Sutherland's prowess is not simply that she hits all the high coloratura notes without cracking, but that she glides up to them with perfect and even tone quality.  She never belts out of the ensemble to get the notes out; her notes just provide the apex of the pyriamid, as it were, in perfect harmony with the rest of the singers on stage.
  Contrary to what the other reviewers have written, Callas has no problem at all hitting the super-high coloratura parts that the role of Lucia demands.  Just get any recording of her in this role to prove that.  Try the live one opposite of Di Stefano.  In fact, I think it's worth mentioning that Callas is one of the few sopranos, save Anna Moffo, who could master the role of Carmen, actually a lower, sensual mezzo-soprano role, as well as Lucia di Lammermoor.  While Sutherland is a true coloratura soprano, Callas can sing almost any role she wants.  No other soprano than Callas has ever had that much success in so many tonal dimensions!!  Not to mention that Callas is also the undisputed queen of acting on the operatic stage.  Her whole life was a drama on and off the stage.  Sutherland, while a fabulous singer, arguably stands quite awkward there.
  It should also be noted that Callas forever changed the nature of this role.  Before her day, only canary-like sopranos, such as Roberta Peters or Lily Pons, sang this role.  It was considered to be one for a young teenage girl forced into a wrongful marriage.  Callas demonstrated a deeper level of the role with her darker tone, bringing out the greater dimensions of Lucia's insanity.  So, in a way Callas paved the road for dramatic coloraturas to sing Lucia, and Sutherland and others like Edita Gruberova and Ruth Ann Swenson have followed suit.  It's just a shame that the CD version of Anna Moffo's version is no longer available.  With Sutherland and Callas dominating the recordings for that role, hers has been underappreciated.
  Onto the criticism of this DVD, I would definitely recommend to any opera fan to obtain this recording.  I need not be redundant by repeating any of the other songs of praise the other reviewers wrote.  They're all true!  The only thing I think needs adding is that Sutherland steals the show to such an extent in the ""Mad Scene"" that the opera seems to reach a climax at that point, so that the final scene of Act III with Alfredo Kraus seems like a let-down, even though his performance is also splendid apart from hers.
  When you watch this DVD, you'll wish you could go back in time and see the performance live.  Every time the crowd goes wild for Sutherland, you'll cheer on along with them.  Lucia di Lammermoor is a great opera that builds itself around the showcase of the coloratura soprano.  In this vein, it's necessary to have a true master performing it.  Get this recording with Sutherland, and you can join in the excitement that everyone else also experiences about her interpretation of Lucia.",1068422400,8,3572,4.7064516129032254
325207,5,6301304977,"The great Australian diva sang it as her debuts first at Covent Garden, then Opera Comique, then La Scala Milan, and finally at the met. The ovations range form 15 to over 30 curtain calls. She took the opera world by storm. She is La Stupenda.
She is about 14 years after that amazing truimph of 1959 that put her as the superstar of the 60's. Forcing even Callas to retire. La Stupenda is about 55 here. The voice is still valid, but to compare to her prime, which was the greatest coloratura singing of our era, she is not nearly as good here. BUT!!!! This is still 100 times better than anyone who has performed this. Listen to the montrous ovations after ovations. The audience is determined to show their love for the Queen of Opera.
This performance is beautiful, the picture and sound is superb. And the singing especially by Sutherland is sublime. But to hear her when she was supreme and very young, I'll check out her Bell Telephone Hours performances of 1961-1968. That...is the Sutherland that is the Queen of Bel Canto assoluta...",1059609600,6,1044,4.588235294117647
325208,5,6301304977,"First off, in a more perfect world we would a performance of Joan Sutherland in ""Luica di Lammermoor"" that was recorded closer to the legendary debut she made at the old Metropolitan Opera in 1961 than this November 13, 1982 performance at new Met and the 1986 version recorded at Sydney.  But unless they put out the 1977 televised performance of ""Lucia"" these are our two choices and no one is going to claim that Sutherland's voice is as good as it was a decade earlier.  But that is hardly the point.  This performance was Sutherland's first at the Met in four years and was clearly as much a celebration of the most memorable opera performance of the last half-century as anything else.  This was an audience that came fully intending to give the diva ovation after ovation, especially at the end of the famous ""Mad Scene,"" where they try to coax the soprano back up on her feet after her character has flung herself to the floor in despair.
The assumption is that this production of the 301st Metropolitan Opera performance of Gaetano Donizetti's ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" (Libretto by Salvatore Cammarano, based on Sir Walter Scott's novel, ""The Bride of Lammermoor"") is something you come upon by choice.  It is not intended as an introduction to opera in general or this pivotal piece in the bel canto repertoire in particular.  The performance is subtitled in English and while there is not an enclosed Libretto there is an introduction written by Wil Crutchfield.  The story is simple and straightforward: Lucia (Sutherland) loves Edgardo (tenor Alfredo Kraus), but her brother Enrico (baritone Pablo Elvira) forces her to wed Arturo (tenor Jeffrey Stamm) to save the family fortune.  Edgardo denounces Lucia for her betrayal and on the wedding night she goes insane and kills her husband.  First Lucia and then Edgardo sing a couple of arias and drop dead.  In short, a perfect opera.
From a vocal standpoint this earlier performance is the better of the two available for viewing, but clearly the Australian production is more of a love fest for Dame Joan, performing in her native land Down Under.  Ultimately, the ovations might provide more chills than the singing, but I think it is impossible not to listen to and watch this performance without thinking what it must have been like when ""the Voice of the Century"" was in her prime.  You feel rather sorry for the other principle singers because as long as Sutherland is on stage singing  that is the only thing to which you pay attention.  If for all intents and purposes you think of this as Dame Joan's curtain call, then that makes it worthwhile on those terms as well.",1056067200,82,2636,4.777533039647577
325209,2,6301304977,"Note: this review is of the VHS version, and only covers content.
Since I have begun watching opera on VHS and DVD, this is one of the more disappointing works I have seen, along with Verdi's Macbeth, and (to a lesser extent) Don Giovanni.
Maybe a different production would help. The first Fidelio I saw was a ... (a Covent Garden production), but the recent televised Met production was totally different.
Most operas take at least a full act to ""draw you in,"" but begin to give you a payoff somewhere around the end of act 2 or beginning act 3. Lucia, at least in this production, never pays off. Lucia's ""Mad Scene"" was one of the greatest ""letdowns"" I have experienced. This was the high point...?
As for Sutherland, her voice might have been great, but watching her is watching a female version of the ""elephant man."" I try to focus on the music, but her face (head?) keeps getting in the way.
If this is a good production of Lucia, I'd hate to see a poor one. There are better operas to be introducted to opera with.",1049760000,5,1023,4.417989417989418
325210,5,6301304977,"I've not been one of Joan Sutherland's greatest fans, though I do enjoy the voice very much.  Often, she sounds dramatically uninvolved and, as my friend remarks, always sounds like she was about to sneeze.
Ok, enough of that.  She is awesome here. Yes, she may not be able to measure up to her recordings of the work, but she has found a new sense of drama, a fire within the music.  I much prefer Sills in this role, who really tore up the stage (or microphone, on her cd).  However, Sutherland does have quite a presence and I am utterly astonished when I hear her pluck an effortless high D at the end of the sextet.  Oh my god!  What I would give to have a high note like that AT ANY AGE!!!!!!!
Here she is in her mid to late fifties doing these things.
She's quite good, as is Plishka and Elvira.  I've never been a huge fan of Alfredo Kraus but, with microphone distancing, he doesn't bother me nearly as much as in his studio recordings.  Overall, I think it's a wonderful time at the opera.  Now, for an even more incredible account, pick up Beverly Sills' version that was just released.  WOW!",1034380800,27,1103,4.310679611650485
325211,1,6301304977,"Sutherland was in her time a very famous soprano, and arguably still is. And that just boggles my mind. I'm sorry, but to me, she is nothing but a canary...and not a very good one either. If you think sutherland is magnificent and can think of nothing better, boy, are you missing out on the beauty and splendor of opera. Once upon a time there were ""singing-actresses"" - sopranos who knew opera was more than just a pretty voice - Callas was one of them. Compared to Callas' dramaticism and incredible ability to convey every heart-felt emotion, Sutherland sounds like someone reading off a grocery list. Ask yourself this - is opera ONLY about hitting the high notes? Take my advice, listen to callas, and you'll never be the same again.",1034208000,6,739,4.648854961832061
325212,5,6301304977,"This is a very exciting performance. Even both Dame Joan and Alfredo Krause were in their fifties,they still showed their vocal wonders that many young singers are dreaming to have. Personally, I don't mind down transposition of certain segment or arias, as long as the final effect is good, as examplified by Dame Joan. Her artistry is really hard to come by. Alfredo always sang with such elegance that none of the ""three tenors "" can claim. He could still sing with a ringing voice till the end of his career close to 70. I truly think his artistry is underappreciated because he did not commercialize himself like others do. This recording is a must to have !",1026345600,13,663,4.627118644067797
325293,2,6301304977,"The whole production is so typical Met - big names that long lost their voice that made them famous.  Sutherland is disappointing, and she acts in a pretentious manner.  Alfredo Kraus is altogether pathetic - one can only respect him for his prior accomplishments, but why did he have to sing here?  Perhaps this is another example of what Met is serious about - big names like these make good cash flow, but these stars' days are long gone.  Met would be so much better off if they had selected younger singers who can truly sing and give the opera some degree of credibility - looking at middle aged people singing parts of teenagers or very young adults, like Lucia and Edgar, is distracting.  And for vocal pleasure, just compare this with Callas and Di Stefano recording of the same opera and the truth would emerge.  Unfortunately, this is indeed the only available DVD of this great opera and it does not give it justice at all.  Overall, the singing is mediocre at best and the acting is pitiful.  After all, bel canot may not be about acting, but the bottomline - superb singing - should be present and it wasn't.  Richard Bonynge conducting is also dull.  I could not find this production exciting at all.  For those who have never listened to Lucia, it's probably OK.  Give it a try for 26 bucks - you would have paid a fortune to attend this performance, so buying this DVD is probably not a bad deal.",1019347200,10,1413,4.4980392156862745
325294,4,6301304977,"TO SEE SUTHERLAND PERFORM THIS ROLE ADDS A WHOLE NEW DIMNSION TO IT.  SIMPLY HEARING IS NOT ENOUGH.  DAME JOAN DOES NOT EMOTE WITH HER VOICE.

THE VOICE OF A 56 YEAR OLD IS UNQUESTIONABLY STRAINED IN SUCH A ROLE, BUT MISS SUTHERLAND IS NONETHELESS BEAUTIFUL.  A COUPLE OF THE HIGHER NOTESARE UNEVEN AND THIN, BUT THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE COLORATURA ARE SOLIDLY AND BEAUTFULLY DELIVERED.

325295,5,6301304977,"One of the most electrifying performances of Lucia I have ever witnessed.  I saw it live and was absolutely enthralled by the entire performance.  I had to have the DVD in my collection.  Sutherland's return to the Met in this performance was remarkable and thrilling.  Her mad scene was without equal in all the opera world.  It brought tears to many in the unusually enthusiastic audience that brought her back for five curtain calls.  Bel Canto will never be the same without Sutherland. The staging, orchestration and the cast were all superior.",1003968000,46,549,4.913043478260869
325296,5,6301304977,"If Sutherland is late in her career in this performance, there is still no one today who sings it likes this even early in their career: power, beauty and fullness of tone, effortless coloratura. Krauss gives another one of his very fine classy perfomances. Age here does give a dryness to the timber. But he had an extraordinary career. Pablo Elvira I'm afraid was very underappreciated  and this is lamentable. His performance here is rich and full in tone, powerful, convincing, untterly sincere, a worlthy partner to Sutherland's Lucia. The Met orchestra is superb as always. A must have!

The costumes and production at The Met are just fine as well.  She is not my favorite Lucia, however, Ruth Ann Swenson is even better that Joan but you can't get her Lucia on video.  Recommended as a memory of Joan in one of her most famous roles if for no other reason.  But it stands as a credible Lucia. Recommended as a truly beautiful opera with great music!",998006400,27,545,4.161904761904762
325298,4,6301304977,"We should be thankful that the Met finally got around to preserving the greatest Lucia of our time, even if she was in the autumn of her career.  Sutherland is faulty here only by comparison with the purity and ease of her more youthful voice, available in memory to operagoers of the 60's and 70's and to owners of recordings.  One commentator in these pages wonders why the Sutherland voice is not of its earlier peerless quality after 1977. Surely, anyone who knows operatic voices is aware that the usual prime for such singers in ages 35 to 50. Sutherland's performance here, at age 56, is still amazing.  This Lucia is memorable for the diva's remarkable, indeed extraordinary elasticity and power even though she has past her prime. One regrets, however, that the forces at Pioneer didn't see fit to digitally remaster the sound, which is really  no improvement over the Videotape or larger disc.  Such a grand occasion deserved more audio attention.",986688000,58,957,4.846625766871166
325299,5,6301304977,"Firstly, the video and sound on this DVD transfer are quite good, especially considering the dates of the original production. That said, the important business at hand is the performance of the greatest Lucia the world has ever seen.
Sutherland made this role her own from the 1959 Covent Garden debut onward. Whilst there are many commentaries and opinions about how influential the people surrounding her on this original project were, even the opinion of Callas says it all: ""That I would do for no one!"" (Referring to Sutherland's moving about the stage so much and falling over backwards down a flight of stairs at the end of the Mad Scene.) Callas had launched the Bel Canto revival with the idea that a large voice could perform the coloratura--Sutherland took THAT to the next level.
While a comparison of this Met performance with her 1962 (or was it 1961?) performance of the Mad Scene on the Bell Telephone Hour shows how the voice had aged and lost its bright sparkle of her early days, this performance shows the experienced and dramatically developed Sutherland at home and secure in herself. There are places when one can hear a slight beat beginning which marked her very last years, but even with the first half of the mad scene transposed downward, the top notes are stellar! For a woman her age at the time (56!) Sutherland gives us more than most other opera stars could hope for in a career. The Regnava... is quite fine and this DVD also gives us an insight (especially for those who never heard her live) into just how large this voice was. The column of sound is HUGE and when she sings with others it is startlingly obvious. It is a shame that Kraus was the Edgardo since he is obviously suffering more from age than Sutherland. If only this had been one of those many Sutherland/Pavarotti events at the Met...
In summary, although this may not be Sutherland at her peak, there is so much good and so much advantage in having this document of her signature role performance that any disadvantages are easily washed away!",982540800,57,2046,4.686111111111111
325300,5,6301304977,"But then, Sutherland is probably my all-time favorite soprano.  I had the great good fortune to see a performance of this production at the Met when I lived in Manhattan at that time.  Because the Met is such a big house (I sat in the orchestra section), the sound on the video is much better than at the live performance.  Krause, in particular was difficult to hear, and Elvira's deeper voice often almost impossible to hear, even in the orchestra seats.  Dame Joan is of  course much older than the heroine, but her difficulties both in voice and physical movement make her seem that much more touching and vulnerable in the role, to me.  The fact that her voice is not the pristine, perfect instrument is was in the 60s and 70s, also, for me, adds emotion and expressiveness to this particular production.  I will always be able to enjoy this performance, and as a lover of vocal and musical beauty, that is quite a comfort to me.  I highly recommend this particular version to anyone who loves the opera, and especially who love Sutherland's voice.
BTW, this is NOT a review of the Australian Opera performance, but the Met Performance of 1982, which I saw live at the Met.",980208000,82,1178,4.576190476190476
325301,5,6301304977,"In the mid 1960s, when The Met still made road tours, a friend and I stood to hear a young Joan Sutherland sing Lucia, so it was with high hopes that this DVD went into the player. In 1982, at the height of her talent, Dame Joan did not disappoint. Teamed with a cast that includued the sumptuous voice of Pablo Elvira as Enrico, and the elegant, poised tenor of the late Alfredo Krause as Edgardo, this Lucia overwhelms the viewer, both visually and acoustically. The conductor is Dame Joan's husband and coach, Richard Bonynge, arguably the finest conductor of bel canto opera. But the performance all comes down to Sutherland, and, for those who were not fortunate to have heard her before her retirement, this disc is overwhelming evidence of why she was referred to as ""La Stupenda""! Vocally spectacular, with a range, fluidity and temperment that makes this as close to a perfect performance as one is likely to see, Dame Joan literally brings the house down at the end of the ""mad scene"". Pioneer, once more, has demonstrated how well opera and DVD technology work together. Don't miss this disc!!

ADENDUM (MARCH 2013): Back when I wrote this review, the DVD manufacturer was Pioneer. Since then DGG has reissued the performance, remastering it to add surround sound. I replaced my Pioneer disc with the DGG version and can report that the remastering is a substantial sonic improvement. The picture remains as good as it was, and while this is not an HD DVD, the improvement is worth the price of the purchase.",974505600,146,1519,4.7320754716981135
325302,4,6301304977,"I have just returned home from a week in Burgundy with the family.  On our arrival back home, in the ususual English rain storm, we found this DVD waiting for us on the dining room table.  We decided to phone out for a pizza and crash out to watch this Met relay; an opera that I have to confess that we have always been very fond.
Funnily enough, whilst in France we had been listening to the 1976 Chicago relay (available on a Bella Voce CD) - with Pavarotti:  in my view amongst the best Lucia's available.  So it made an interesting comparison to watch Sutherland in this 1982 relay.
I am confused as to why people expected Dame Joan to be in the same wonderful voice as she was 10 to 15 years before.  What I think is amazing is that she can still sing with such flexibility and magnetism.  I thoroughly enjoyed her interpretation, even though her voice has undoubtedly lost some of it's flexibility.  The mad scene is just stupendous and I am just sorry that this version has never been available to buy in England.  Thank goodness the Met has put it out on DVD so that the British Isles can enjoy it too.
Pablo Elvira is excellent as Enrico as is Paul Plishka as Raimondo.  The sextet deserves every second of the tremendous ovation it receives from the audience - luck things, I would have given my back teeth to have been there.
Oh dear, I am sure I shouldn't speak ill of the dead - but my wife always describes the late Alfredo Krauss as having dead fish eyes which seem to lack emotion.  I have to say that I agree - I know I will be up setting his millions of fans aound the globe, but he doesn't move me at all.  He sings well, he acts well - but for me he doesn't have that final oomph or charisma to lift him into the great singers category.  Sorry.  What a shame the Met didn't have Pavarotti or Carreras to sing Edgardo.
However, this is an excellent production - which would have sounded less pedestrian with James Levine in charge of the excellent Met orchestra. Bonynge just leaves it a touch slack - my problem always with his conducting. But it is a good document to show why the world went wild for Dame Joan back in those early days at Covent Garden.
It is worth getting, even though Dame Joan has to work harder to achieve the same vocal results of her past.  We found it a very enjoyable evening, worth coming home from holiday for - and of course school tomorrow!!",972777600,37,2392,4.286666666666667

7810996,5,6301304977,"I find it impressive that an Opera DVD has 46 reviews since many of them have none or only one.  Many of these reviews commented critically on technical aspects of Ms Sutherland's performance.  I do not sing, I do not read music, but I watch many operas on DVD and attend live performances.  My major criteria is whether or not the total performance (staging, costumes, singing, etc) is emotionally and dramatically satisfying.  With this criteria I rate this DVD very highly (my wife does also; she was in tears at the end).  The DVD quality is excellent, particularly considering that it was recorded in 1982.  On a 53 inch high definition screen using a good quality upscaling DVD player, I found the images to be sharp, no pixelation, minimal to no ghosting, and great color even in the dimly lit scenes.  On rare occasion there was a bit of focus transition during zoom ins, but the out of focus period was very brief and barely noticable.  The sound was clean with reasonable fidelity.  The sound stage was minimal with most of the sound seeming to come from the center of the image.  The staging was very traditional (which for me is good).  The video director was not afraid to allow a scene to play out.  He did not do lots of quick cuts.  His reaction shots were well chosen.  A great evening at the opera.",1362268800,,1316,4.54468085106383

And with Alfredo Kraus on hand (the most consistently splendid and underrated of the great dark tenors of his generation), and with Bonynge in the pit this was a grand and moving event. There was  excitement too, because it was not clear where the next generation of leading divas was coming from at the time, and the Met audience savored the evenings when true representatives of the age of great singers were on the boards, in good health and good voice. Sutherland was always in spendid voice, but she did not often immerse herself in a character like Freni, or Price or Tebaldi were able to rise to the great moments.  Here she did, and it is a transcendent memory.  I am going to buy this. I will let you know how it holds up. I saw the Pavoratti version (in his prime) and he also could milk this opera for all it was worth, despite his curious inability to really inhabit the character.",1145318400,6,951,4.422857142857143
7810998,5,6301304977,"I think Donizetti's little masterpiece is a perfect opera, everything fits, it's self-contained, events follow naturally, logically and psychologically from each other in a perfectly self-sufficient universe to the end, and the end and what Edgardo is thinking are natural and perfect too.  The music's good too.  It's too good.  It reminds me of Rigoletto (these are in fact my 2 favorite operas, Tosca used to be a third but I've begun to find too many empty places in it, too many periods of musical blank).  Like Lucia, every tune in Rigoletto is a winner, and the opera follows it's own evolution to its, well, as in Lucia, I'm tempted to say natural or logical conclusion.  I love both operas.  But this one.  Sutherland was wonderful.  Her singing was stunning.  Everyone was marvelous, but she was ""la stupenda,"" and she certainly earned her sobriquet in this performance.  She was so involved in the drama and the music of the mad scene that she was singing that she had difficulty coming out of it during her curtain call afterward.  In fact, it wasn't until the end of the endless ovation that she was able to come to herself and smile.  I love her.  Note:  how do the members of the chorus and singers of minor roles feel sharing the stage with greatness such as this, a greatness that they themselves will never achieve.  It's sad.  Surely they're jealous and unhappy.  Oh well.  This was a wonderful production of a wonderful opera.  One last note:  I could imagine Sutherland back stage laughing and messing up her hair and dipping her hands in ""blood"" preparatory to the mad scene.",1141344000,8,1597,4.717391304347826
7810999,4,6301304977,"The ghost Lucia sees rising from the well is not the only ghost in this production. When the singers move onstage, they leave a shadow trail. This was very distracting.",1105660800,,168,4.633333333333334
7811000,2,6301304977,"Lucia di Lammermoor is a bel canto masterpiece that requires both vocal agility and a good sense of dramatic skill.  By the time this DVD was recorded, Dame Joan no longer had the beautiful high notes she once possessed.  Her voice is now droopy, her Italian slurred by some strange force of nature.  In other words, her Lucia is a maddening disaster.  Callas and Sills and Moffo at least brought some justice to the role, and throughout their career, the good Lucias were preserved on record.  Sutherland was a vocally good Lucia, but she lacked drama, an essential component to the bel canto school of singing.  Thank goodness Alfredo Kraus was there to save the performance.

And for the demented Callas basher, don't bring your [...] around here.  Callas' genius does not deserve to be insulted by the despondent pool of dumbness [...] that you come from.  She can sing Lucia around dame Joan and you know it.",1103155200,7,913,4.727848101265823
7811001,1,6301304977,"Some have commented that this is the best Lucia on DVD. If it is, are we hard up. Sutherland is beyond petrified, she is at the embalmed stage. This is just an eerie echo of her famed

Lucia from 25 years earlier. Some parts are transposed so that

she can ""appear"" to sing the familiar high options.

Pushing part of the mad scene downward puts sections of it in the area were Sutherland is forced to growl to get through them.

In all fairness, much of Sutherland's technique is still intact and she still is able to do the amazing feat of darting around the stage during the flute cadenza of the mad scene. It's just too bad there isn't a video documentation from her prime.

The production is typical Met musty routine, with no real attempt to bring any drama at all to the performance.

Bonynge leads the performance in a very careful way to help Dame Joan avoid as many vocal risks as possible.

Yes, the ageless Kraus sings Edgardo and he does it well. But at this point point his voice had taken on a somewhat wooden quality.

Both lead singers are approaching their 60th birthdays and it is impossible to avoid the march of time.

I would recommend getting the Devia Lucia on DVD or the Opera Lyon Lucie DVD",1096156800,20,1216,4.392857142857143

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SUTHERLAND SINGING TOSCA (DONT MENTION THE HILARIOUS STUDIO TURANDOT)....BUT CALLAS WOULD SING PURITANI AND THE NEXT DAY BRUNHILDE!CAN YOU IMMAGINE LA STUPENDA WITH HORNS ON HER HEAD???TERRIFYING!!!!",1079740800,12,1231,5.317948717948718
7811003,3,6301304977,"I'm annoyed and angered by this ignorance that is being sold as the ""truth"". Joan Sutherland was already singing for years in 1959 and Callas didn't ""quit"" because of her. Callas sang her last performance in 1965 but never officially retired. (There were plans for Norma, Medea etc.) And the 1971 Lucia is NOT the bestselling Lucia of all time. But even if it were: Charlotte Church's ""Opera-Recitals"" outsell Sutherland (NOT Callas!) by far, so Church is ""better"" than Sutherland? Get real!
Callas doesn't crack on 25% of the E-flats, there are only two in Lucia di Lammermoor and she always sang them well. And it's called verismo, such ignorance is LAUGHABLE. And guess what, in ""verismo"" you NEED a great technique as well. Ask Caballe, de los Angeles, Tebaldi ETC. Etc.
This DVD was recorded too late and shows us a mere shadow of a once great Lucia. Stick to the recordings.",1078444800,10,880,4.758169934640523
