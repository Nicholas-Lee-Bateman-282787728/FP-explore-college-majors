5115669,5,B0080730BG,"This was a fun new continuation of season three! For anyone that has seen part one of this season (like I did) you were left hanging out there a bit at the end of the last DVD, so I know that I, for one, was definitely holding out hope that this DVD would come out sooner than later. Now that I have seen it, I have to say that it was worth the wait. You get such great humor within this series and within these episodes, and I love the artistry as well! I have some friends that do not completely understand the humor, but for me, I find the series, fun and entertaining and one that I would highly recommend!",1343260800,3,610,4.049586776859504
