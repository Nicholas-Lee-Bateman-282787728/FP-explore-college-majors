7958431,4,B0000633UV,"""Rurouni Kenshin, Volume 18: Fall From Grace"" provides the final episodes of the story arc focusing on the persecution of Christians in Japan and Shougo Amakusa, who believes himself to be a god and is well versed in the Hiten Mitsurugi fighting style.  Sanosuke had fallen for Shougo's sister, the devou`t Magdaria, but the battle has cost the young Christian girl her life.  Meanwhile, Himura Kenshin, the former Hitokiri Battousai, is eager to match swords again with Shoguo despite now being blind.
The first two episode included on ""Fall From Grace"" provide the end of the Christian saga: Episode 75, ""The Last Crusade: The Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki Crash!,"" which has the climactic sword fight between the wounded Shoguo and the blind Himura; Episode 76, ""Bon Voyage: Hope Overcome the Melancholy Waves,"" is the epilogue to this particular story arc as the Christians are ordered to leave Japan.  As we have come to expect after the completion of these longer story arcs, the next couple of episodes are pretty much comic relief: Episode 76, ""There's a Himura Dojo in Shimonoseki?  Another Battousi Appears"" has the gang amazed to discover that some guy has shown up in town claiming to be the legendary manslayer.  Kenshin is willing to let the fake have his way, since he is not doing any one any harm, but the man's boasts have attracted someone who wants to make their reputation by killing the Battousi.  Episode 77, ""The Artist's Crush: A Romantic Spree at the Hakone Hot Spring,"" has the gang going back to Hakone for a little rest and relaxation, which is complicated first by a lack of money and then by a young artist who draws Kaoru and then falls in love with her.
After the epic Kyoto story line the ""Tales of the Meiji"" stories tend to strike fans of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" as being of lesser quality, but pretty much anything they came up with was going to be disappointing in comparison.  The take on the persecution of Christian in Meiji Japan is certainly interesting, especially from this side of the Pacific, and if Kenshin and Kaoru are not going to go anywhere with their feelings than having Sanosuke's tragic romance with Magdaria at least showed some movement on the emotional side of the story.",1077580800,3,2221,4.798429319371728
7958432,5,B0000633UV,"Ok I've heard alot of people say that they didn't enjoy the VHS. But hey I did I thought I was great. I know I've said it once already. The eps. on it were great, and it had moments where you just wanted to hold on to your seat and not let go. It also has humor the kind that makes your sides hurt by the time you are done.",1057708800,,323,3.6285714285714286
