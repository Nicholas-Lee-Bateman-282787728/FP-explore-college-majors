8494176,4,B0066O108K,"Typical dry, slightly dark Romanian movie of the 'new wave' cinema in East-Europe. Four stars is for the authenticity of the raw dialog, character impersonation and sensation that is all real, happening now. Keep the kids away...",1419984000,,229,5.216216216216216
8494177,5,B0066O108K,"At first, this seem a really simple story, just to soon realize it is the story of our every day lives, of people who find excuses not to spend time with family/children, of miscommunication, of pursuit of the material, and of living in personal fantasies. The various versions adults have of their actions (such as the husband/wife, or every one of the three friends individually) illustrate how far apart are objective and subjective realities.
An awesome movie to watch!!!",1376092800,2,475,5.025316455696203
8494178,4,B0066O108K,"I purchased this movie, curious to see how much Romanian, my birth language, I remember.

I was soon grateful to find out that the English closed captions were present. The music brought back memories, the story consisted in the daily life (with its ups and downs) of a young family, and its ending reminded me of some of the final moments in recent  French movies: NOTHING IS SOLVED....PROBLEMS REMAIN.... LIFE CONTINUES.",1354665600,3,422,4.929577464788732
8494179,4,B0066O108K,Another gem from the romanian movie makers. Kind of slow if you are not romanian because of the poor english translation.,1353974400,2,121,4.809523809523809
