8050085,5,B0007PAMOM,"I've probably seen five different versions of this spectacular true story.  Almost all of them use much of the same still photography and motion picture footage taken during the expedition.

Yet, surprisingly, this seems to be the only version that really gets it all right - it nails all the details, puts a human stamp on the characters, and puts all the events into their proper, riveting perspective. And it's all told at a crisp pace that grabs your attention and never lets go.

Sad news: This DVD is out of print and very pricey even used.  Good news: You can watch it on YouTube.

Highly recommended.",1440028800,,608,4.644859813084112
8050086,5,B0007PAMOM,"Finally, I got around to the Shackleton story, and this Nova TV documentary seems to do it right. At two hours, there is plenty of fascinating detail. What struck me were the professional quality films and photos that survived the ill fated voyage. You will think this is recreation, but it's not. It's real. Watch this if you can find it at your library.",1303689600,,355,4.5625
8050087,5,B0007PAMOM,"This version of the saga of Shackleton aired on PBS.  Since then several other commercialized stories for IMAX (as a 40 minute movie) and A&E (for a mini-series) have been released.

For time following its release this version was not available on DVD except to educational institutions for some reason.  I searched Amazon off and on for three years before it became available at which time I purchased it without a second thought.

This version is the original NOVA documentary. IT IS SPECTACULAR.

It is well done. It interviews descendants of the expedition and historians as it tells this amazing tale.  It also uses actual photos and video from the expedition while quoting the diaries and journal of the crew.

There are numerous leadership lessons to be gleaned from this film.  In fact, some of my graduate school colleagues used the Shackleton story as a case study in leadership and group dynamics.

Anyone, young or old, will be inspired by and enjoy the insights presented in this story... not to mention be in awe of the expedition's men in their own right for what they ""Endured.""",1174176000,6,1094,4.838709677419355
8050088,5,B0007PAMOM,"I SAW THIS DOCUMENTARY WHEN IT ORIGINALLY AIRED ON NOVA IN 2002. IT GRABBED ME FOR TWO HOURS AND HAD MY COMPLETE ATTENTION. THIS IS THE BEST ACCOUNT THAT I'VE SEEN REGARDING THE VOYAGE OF THE ENDURANCE AND IT'S CREW. IT IS THE ULTIMATE STORY OF HEROISM, BRAVERY, SACRIFICE AND ULTIMATELY SURVIVAL THAT HAS EVER OCCURED. THERE ARE FEW MEN IN THE WORLD LIKE ERNEST SHACKLETON AND THE MEN THAT ACCOMPINIED HIM  THAT POSSESSED THE LEADERSHIP AND SKILL TO RETURN FROM THE ICY HELL THAT THESE MEN ENDURED. THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE.",1169510400,6,532,4.6
8050089,5,B0007PAMOM,"The voyage of the Endurance, a tough little ship designed to carry Commander Shackleton and his crew to the little-explored continent of Antarctica, is a story mired by the events that were unfolding around the world (most notably, World War I).

The filming of this documentary was phenomenal. The fact that professional film-grade stock and still photos survived are a testament to the will of the men who made it back to civilization. They seemed to know instinctively how important it was to save the photographs and images.

For those who aren't familiar with the history of the Endurance, it was the fated ship that tried to make it to Antarctica with sled dogs and supplies in an attempt to make it to the South Pole. They never made it. And this story might never have been told had it not been for the simple fact that the men survived 22 months in some of the most desolate and body-numbing cold imaginable. And not one man (not ONE!) died. Most, if not all, of the men's survival can be directly attributed to Commander Shackleton, a man of vigor and unwavering optimism. His skill, knowledge, and leadership led to the rescue of every single member of the party.

From crossing the worst seas on the planet in a rescue skiff, to spending long hours listening to the ice pack break up under their tents, this harrowing tale is something every school child needs to have knowledge of. Not because they were explorers and tried to make it to the South Pole; but because they didn't make it, and came away with something much more valuable: the understanding of the importance of life.",1109894400,24,1593,4.661921708185053
