1669093,2,B00005UWBG,"As far as propaganda goes, this movie lays it on pretty thick. Good conquers, with all the enemies of God being struck down by lightning. Yes, actual bolts of lightning.
The story is simple. The Antichrist (Michael York) arises to power and glory, and the only one who can stand against him is his little brother, who happens to be the President of the United States (Michael Beihn). As the two Michaels (I mean brothers) face off against each other in the final act, there is a great battle at the city of Meggido and the winner is, of course, God.
Michael York is quite good in his rediculously overblown role as the evil one. He gleefully spouts biblical rhetoric and cackles evilly at the most appropriate moments, making a perfectly hateful enemy. Michael Beihn fares less well, as the Vice President of the U. S. who has the role of President (and righteous adversary) thrust upon him. The screenwriters had all their fun with the role of the villain, and didn't save much for the good guy. Plus, Beihn actually tries to inject some real emotion and dimension into his character. You can almost get a glimpse of his acting skill as it tries to transcend his lackluster role.
The effects are quite well done though, i'll give them that. The final battle seems incredibly grand in scale, tanks and soldiers and hundreds of firey explosions everywhere! Not to mention the airplanes and choppers! There is one really good air-to-air combat scene, where I felt like I could actually be in the plane as it descended into the fray. Good stuff! The Antichrist revealed in his daemon shape is slightly less well done but probably as good as the technology and the budget could make him. It's better than The Rock's face in 'The Mummy Returns' (that made me actually laugh in the theatre).
Udo Kier appears in his latest creepy servant-of-darkness role, and is not bad. Besides, Micheal Beihn always looks good in camoflage pants. :)
Never mind the televangelist at the beginning of the tape telling us how important this film is, and how armageddon is only years away. This is a MOVIE, people! And according to this one, your only hope is to live in ""the God-blessed United States""!
Two stars. I have seen worse.",1015804800,8,2209,4.681233933161954
1669094,4,B00005UWBG,"No Human being can ever really comprehend what that last great battle will be like, but watching this movie, and the end, (which I did 6 times) will have you praising God and saying
""Even so, Come now Lord Jesus""!!!
  A wonderful movie for those who await Christ's return, and are inspired and filled with hope in the watching of this movie..
Not perfect, but the best I've seen in this avenue so far!",1015372800,3,401,4.405405405405405
1669095,4,B00005UWBG,"The timing of this film's release was perfect.  Ten days after the September 11th attacks.  I saw The Omega Code when it was released in theaters in 1999 and bought it on DVD.  I liked it very much.  I also saw Megiddo twice in theaters (especially the day it opened - with my god-sister) and was thoroughly impressed.  Although, I haven't read The Bible as much as I should have, the parts of Revelation that I did read (especially the rise and fall of the Anti-Christ) were visually depicted (as far as I'm concerned) with almost perfection in this film.  I also knew (when seeing this film) that TBN had to have a storyline and put a touch of ""Hollywood"" to draw the type of attention needed.  It has the makings of a great Christian movie with characters quoting scriptures from The Bible as well as the protagonist (played by Michael Biehn) going to GOD in prayer seeking guidance.  The Anti-Christ (played convincingly by Michael York) challenges GOD and deceives the world by convincing everyone that he's all for peace and humanity in ""the new world"".  When that challenge is made, GOD's wrath immediately goes into action.  Before I saw The Omega Code and Megiddo, I was thoroughly convinced that somewhere someone knows how to get to the missing books of The Bible and that this person or beast is controlling all governments of this world.  Think about it.  While both films may not touch every issue in the books of Daniel and Revelation, it does manage to interject the word of GOD and the fact that Jesus is Lord.  The special effects are pretty cool.  And to think that the devil is 1,000,000+infinity uglier than the visual depiction in this film scares the hell out of me.  The depiction in the film sent chills throughout my anatomy everytime I saw this film and still does.  I like the fact that this film relies heavily on storytelling rather than an all-out special effects extravaganza.  The second time I saw this film was after church and, like the first time I saw it, had me as well as others praising GOD and saying/shouting ""Hallelujah"" when the devil finally bow down and admits that Nazarene is Lord right before being cast down into the firey pits of Hell and chained.  The praises got even louder when the scripture from Revelation appeared on the screen.  I bought the DVD for this film and was not disappointed at all.  My mother (she only saw the second half of the film) and I watched it last night and we both were very much into the film.  I will play it again so that my parents and I can enjoy the film in its entirety.  I've also told my extended family members (you know, very close friends) about this film as well as The Omega Code.  I told them to see both films.  As a matter of fact, I recommended both films to a friend of mine who happens to work in the CD/Video/DVD department at Best Buy (thus, having seen the Megiddo title in stock but have not seen the movie).  Now, he's going to at least rent or buy it on VHS.  I'm also recommending both films to whomever is reading my review for Megiddo.  Buy it!!!!  Buy it!!!! By it!!!!  The film is truly a message from GOD.",1015027200,15,3119,4.470796460176991

1669097,2,B00005UWBG,"Oh, Lordy.
If the Sci-Fi Channel ever brings back ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" for new episodes, have I got a film for them!  _Megiddo_, the alleged ""prequel/sequel"" to 1999's surprise sleeper _Omega Code_, has nothing at all to do with the events of the original film.  It opened just after the 9/11 ...  attacks and flopped miserably at the box office, leaving even the committed Christians who actually admitted to enjoying _Omega Code I_ scratching their heads in shock and disbelief.
The connoisseur of bad movies will find much to love in this grand fiasco from Paul Crouch and the Trinity Broadcasting Network.  Let's start with a plot that rips off not one, but all three theatrically released _Omen_ movies.  Add veteran thespian Michael York, who camps up his character so much that we might as well call him the Auntie Christ.  And don't forget the other members of the cast, each of whom comes with his or her own incomprehensible accent: there's Udo Kier (overacting as if he never left those Andy Warhol films), that blond skinny guy from _The Terminator_ (who is still blond and skinny), and some Italian chick who's a dead ringer for Valeria Golino (as in ""Whatever happened to ...""?).
Not enough, kiddies?  Throw in considerable American flag-waving and jingoism, a benignly racist subtext (watch for the bug-eyed Africans and the wily Chinese -- and yes, there's even a Black maid), and a staggering ignorance of international geopolitics that makes me wonder: Did Jesse Helms ever actually believe any of this end-times stuff?  Then there's that warm, human moment when Satan himself rips Michael York's body apart from the inside out (""Euwww!"").  Blurry CGI graphics and phony-baloney special effects (""Hey!  Why is the Colosseum stuck in the middle of a cornfield?"") only enhance the overall _Megiddo_ experience.
Are you not entertained?  Well, there's also an enormous climactic bloodbath that lasts at least half an hour.  And don't forget the plagues, fires, earthquakes and riots -- each rendered in loving detail.  (While I'm at it, did I mention that Christian filmmaking was originally conceived as a reaction _against_ excessive violence in Hollywood?)  I'll tell you, this old gorehound got his money's worth and then some.
So run, don't walk -- as far away from this God-awful mess as you can.  Or stick around, if you've got the stomach, and have a hearty laugh or two at the Religious Right's (considerable) expense.  As Dr. Forrester on MST3K would say, ""DEEEP HURRTINNNG!""",1014768000,5,2510,5.026570048309178

1669099,5,B00005UWBG,"I am not one of the rightwing fundamentalist viewers of the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), but I have to give them a big thumbs up for producing ""Megiddo: The Omega Code 2"".  Originally what led me to see the movie was a misleading preview I read in a local independent news paper, essentially characterizing it as a political movie.  Thus when I went to see ""Megiddo"" in theater, I was surprised to see that it was a biblically-based fiction film - of course entrenched in a very stately setting.  I was quite delighted with the movie.  Rating it within its genre, ""Megiddo"" beats out movies like ""Stigmata"" and ""End of Days"" by a long shot.  And overall, the beautiful storyline and the masterful special FX (except for the few CG characters in the movie, which are budget to say the least) make this an exquisite work of art!

While it is entertaining, I would absolutely not show it to an unsaved friend.  Despite TBN's claims, it is not a good witnessing tool.  Apocalypse/Revelation/Tribulation/Judgement are much better for witnessing.",1014422400,3,355,5.518518518518518

1669186,4,B00005UWBG,"For the budget and type of film this is, they went all out on some good actors of the time it was made.  I was surprised to see R. Lee Ermy (Full Metal Jacket), Michael Biehn (Aliens, Navy Seals, The Rock, Abyss), and Udo Kier (Famous for his distinct soft voice) appear in the sequel.  The first film covered roughly the same period of time minus flashbacks of Stone Alexander (Michael York) but they did a good job of avoiding overlap (If you have watched all 4 Jason Bourne movies, it is similar to the way Matt Damon was frequently spoken of in the 4th film, yet other clips were intertwined showing the scenes we had seen before)  I gave this 4 stars because I expected TBN to inject a bit more of God's awesome power into the film.  You get to see a minute or two of his intervention at the end, but most films about this period in time usually focus more on how to get through it from a spiritual perspective (Left Behind Series)  I also smelled a bit of Hollywood influence in this film, but in the end key points were covered quite well biblically speaking without a lot of direct scripture quotes.",1452556800,,1107,4.328502415458937

I have seen movies that were supposed to be better made that weren't really any better. My comments are regarding the actual ""Battle Of Megiddo"" at the end for which my outlook is: a battle for supremacy of the world for all time ought to come down to more than a couple of divisions and a handful of naval aircraft. In general the battle unfolds in the order of immortal bad guys vs. mortal good guys and then we get a new and wholly literal treatment of the old Deus Ex Machina ending.

There are some favorite actors featured. As making a movie goes it is well done, the parts well played, artistically and technically first rate.

The motto ""give the people what they want"" works well in the film industry. In general I am harsh on modern films and don't rate them highly but I gave this one four stars and the reason being it delivers what it promises to the audience it is intended for. It is intelligent, it doesn't preach or proselytize, it is not cloying and does not belabor the obvious. You get a reasonable enough plot for the circumstance, with good actors and good production.

After a dictator takes over the world, with the exceptions of a few holdouts, he invites all the armies of every company to meet him in one spot. Many of the armies are not truly on his side and then attack the others for an all out battle to the finish. It is not a very realistic battle, sadly, but I do not see how it could have been done under this budget anyway.
Michael Biehn from the Terminator movie is great as the brother of the antichrist played by Michael York, and a good guy who is elected vice-president of the USA. The acting is decent for all, the script flows pretty well, but gets a little buggy at the end. I think they could have improved things by taking more from the Book of  Revelations in the Bible. It was not very accurate to scripture if that is what you are looking for. It was good to watch once, but I do not think I will see it again.",1271635200,,989,4.097938144329897

1669276,4,B00005UWBG,"I just finished watching this movie rebroadcast on TBN and I thought I had seen it.  Then I remembered the first movie, the Omega Code and realized that's what I saw.

Many Christian films are guilty of bad scripts and overacting.  However, that doesn't mean that there isn't something to be learned.  Some commented on the fact that Jesus was not mentioned at all.  However, I think if the name of Jesus had been overused and the movie played out in a typical fashion of the already faithful saving the world.

The writer's interpretation of the antiChrist in this film does lend itself to some very historical figures, if you can recognize them.  Rather, I appreciate the fact that this film has characters fighting an evil they don't even understand.  They just know he's evil and they don't know why for most of the movie.

I would definitely show this movie to a youth group (I don't think it's for adults unless they are in the military) and those who would respond specifically to this message.  It definitely appeals to a certain type of individual, so it should not be discounted.

Sure, there are other films about the anti-Christ and you can choose whether or not you want to view them, but I believe so many of these films exist because people want answers and they are searching for them.  At this particular time in world history, it is acceptable to talk about the anti-Christ again.  Then we will be on to something else.

Give the message a chance and not focus on the superficial things about the movie.  Aren't we supposed to be better than that?",1233100800,,1565,4.59927797833935

However I found it to be better that the one before it and there were a couple of good special effects. I am always curious as to why men of God are always portrayed in film as wimpy? That is, with the exception of Moses in the Ten Commandments.

My family found the first Omega Code ""cheesy"" to watch, and not very spiritual or Biblically inspiring whatsoever.  Part Two (Omega Code 2) was so bad that we turned it off about 1/3 of the way thru the movie.  From demonic encantations, to blood dripping moments, to demons themselves....this film was hype, cheesy, and spent far too much time showing the span of life's journey of the antiChrist figure.  The Bible itself does indicate that an antiChrist will appear on the scene, it's no doubt!  But other than saying he will reveal himself at somepoint, and will be a law unto himself, there isn't a whole lot of detail about him (most certainly not about his childhood and love-life!).  This film is backed by Paul Crouch and Hal Lindsey, i'll leave that alone, as they are interviewed on the DVD features.  Interesting how God Almighty has decided not to dwell on the antiChrist's sadistic demonism, nor on the antiChrist's growing up and jockeying for power, yet this film spends indepth coverage of the matter, and once again ""hollywood-izes"" the Bible for cheap thrills.  If you want Biblical, if you don't want to watch a version of the Exorcist, then don't buy this film.  B-film, and bad taste.",1157241600,4,1314,4.852017937219731

It tells the story of how Stone got to become the Beast himself (generally a down hill slide since he was pissed off at the death of his mother giving birth to his younger brother- I guess you have the choice of going to therapy or becoming the Prince of Darkness - Stone chooses the second)

There is a love triangle thrown in for good measure between Stone and his brother David and Gabriella (as in the angel Gabriel, get it?)

To try and some up the dizzying plotline in a pragraph would be tough, but it's basically about the Devil wanting to take over the world through the construction of a world union that gives him all the power - all the nations go along with this except for America and China, - a big battle at the Biblically prophesized Megiddo ensues.

The special effects in the film are TV quality and it does let the film down in the end when the devil appears looking a little more fleshed out than a Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtle.

All that aside, the storyline is quite engaging and the film is eminently watchable and a worthy successor to the first film.  But does the President of the United States have to end up being God's representative to save the day?",1127692800,3,1298,4.299180327868853

The movie also has a prevailing Amercan theme- I'm in no way anti-American, but the story almost strugles to include Americans- his brother just turns out to be the Vice-President! It also gives the impression that America is totally against Antichrist, but when the real thing occurs, every country will surrender to the charismatic leader pretty quickly, I'd say. I was really pleased with the visuals and acting, though, and the film clearly shows good triumphing over evil. But I recommend Left Behind instead of this.

1669314,4,B00005UWBG,"This possible scenario of the Last Days is outrageously entertaining, with a script that delights after many viewings, and some fine performances.
It starts in 1960: Stone Alexander (the anti-christ) is the son of a media magnate, a horrid child who almost succeeds in immolating his baby brother. Ten years pass and we see him as a young (meaner and leaner) cadet, and then 25 years later, he appears as a full-blown menace, in the form of Michael York. Ten more years pass, and as the Chancellor of the United World Union, York makes the most of this part, and has some delicious dialogue; there is his sacrament, ""This is my flesh, made foul with sin, etc..."", and best of all, in a speech in Africa, where he is like Jimmy Swaggart in his heyday, with the words twisted inside-out. It is a brilliant piece of scripting and acting.
Others in the cast that are noteworthy are Diane Venora, an actress who has never received her dues, is wonderful as Stone's wife, Michael Biehn is good as his brother, the president of the U.S., Udo Kier lurks about as ""The Guardian"", and R.Lee Ermey is marvelous as President Benson.
There are lovely scenes of Rome, and some of the sets are clever, like the old diner with a sign that reads ""Hamburger $ 15.00, with cheese, $ 20.00"". Nothing like world chaos to bring about a little inflation.
Not all the effects and battle scenes are believable, and it is far from being a ""movie masterpiece"", but if you are interested in Bible prophesy plots, this is a film that is fascinating as well as a loads of fun.",1082505600,24,1546,4.544802867383512
1669315,2,B00005UWBG,"This is TBN's second attempt at telling the story of how the anti-christ comes to power and it's really quite bad.
The anti-christ also known as Stone Alexander, (played by a wide-eyed Michael York in overacting mode). Meanwhile his brother David, (Michael Biehn) is also high up in government and is also in love with his brother's wife, (Gabriella Francini).
Now the film started off well enough, watching a young anti-christ at school brought back memories of the Omen, that is where all simulat but it soon degenerates into melodrama and suffers from a very poor script and uninspired acting. I really did not care for the characters either which is important in this kind of film.
Now don't get me wrong, I as a christian enjoy a good movie about the end of the world, but it needs to have a good story to work out. And as with Omega Code, the ending is ridiculous, unless your in the know you would not know that Jesus has returned, the cheesy cgi devil just yells out ""the nazerene"", for some obscure reason. There is so much great material in the book of revelation, if the filmakers would use that as the basis and write the story around the events described there it could be sensational. I hear on the grapevine that there is a mini-series out soon on t.v. on revelation that is written by the same guy who wrote the Omen, that fills me with a little hope. Until then, steer clear of this one and check out ""Revelation"", by cloud ten pictures or ""the Omen"", ""Left Behind 1 and 2."" or better yet read the book!!
TBN seem to have a penchant for making bad films and seem to get the christian message distorted, ""Omega Code"", ""the Champion"" and now ""Megiddo"" all suffer the same fate.

As always, these ""End of the World"" movies are anticlimactic. Big battle, bright light, badguys: ""Oh, it's Jesus; let's give up."" Sorry, but I'll be kinda disappointed if that's truly how it is. Are we to believe that a creature as old as Satan is so stupid? Why bother?

Oh, yeah, it's blatantly pro-american/anti-international as well (coming close to racism at times).
God had every right to sue the writer for plagiarizing his Cain &Abel tale, but giving insight to the rich (read: ludicrous) story, the classic (read: worn out) analogies and the enlighting (read: proselytising) morals is beyond the focus of that review, it's enough to say it's a complete mess.
However, if you thought that catholics, the European Union and international charity work are the deeds of Satan, then, and only then this could have been a movie for you.
But even the most glaring, christian fanatist/American nationalist (preferably both) will note that there are many other things wrong, really wrong, with this flick.
The special effects are cheap, perhaps videogame niveau, the dialogues are not wothy the words to describe them, and the acting, well, the acting... I don't know, i haven't foound any.
So, after all, is this a bad movie?
Yes, yes it certainly is.
It's both, religiously and politically questionable, but even if you ignore this (or even like this sort of stuff) it's still a truly horrible movie on its own.

Both are true for this movie.
""Meddigo: The Omega Code 2"" is supposed to be a sequel to the ""Omega Code,"" I guess. It delves deeply into the background of the Antichrist Stone Alexander, played by Michael York, but it skips around the ending of the first movie. It's given as an alternative, with the Antichrist coming to power, the abandoning the world come to revere him.
While it's a great concept, it's flawed in the execution, especially the climax. The climax is almost ludicrous. The actions of the heroes seem improbable. The Antichrist's minions reminded me of the Crimson Guard from the old GI Joe cartoon series. And the computer-generated Satan had me just shaking my head.

1669321,5,B00005UWBG,"Megiddo, the superb follow-up to The Omega Code, is by without a doubt one of the best Christian end-times film I have ever seen. It is better than the first one in every way that counts, especially in the area of character development. Megiddo provides a greater perspective on the character of Stone Alexander, the young boy who is destined to become the future Antichrist, ruler of the world in the last days. We also meet Stone Alexander's younger brother, David, who is destined to become the one who exposes his brother for who he really is.
This film also shows in a greater light Stone Alexander's rise to power, showing how he came to be the world-ruling Antichrist, indwelt and empowered by Satan himself. David Alexander's character is greatly developed as well. We see how David comes to be a follower of God and how he is thrown in direct conflict with his evil brother.
Megiddo climaxes with the war of Armageddon, the final war of mankind's history. It vividly portrays the battle between good and evil, and the victory that good has over evil. Satan, portrayed in this movie as being a hideous dragon-like creature, is thrown into the bottomless pit as a result of the arrival of Christ Himself to the Earth to establish His millenial reign, transforming the devastated Earth into a paradise.
In concluding this review, I would like to take this opportunity to highly reccomend this film to anyone who enjoys a thrilling end-times thriller that depicts with uncanny accuracy God's plan for the ages as put forth in the Bible. 5 stars.

The effects are good in this movie, that's the only reason why I gave it 2 stars. SOME of the acting is good, but its not that great. It really isn't a sequel. To me a sequel means the continuation of a story. This is anything but. The whole story line is different. It strays quite a bit from the 1st movie, even completely re-telling the story, different in every way, from the 1st movie.
I really thought this movie was horrible. The story just was not that good. I don't know how anyone thinks this could be even close to what is told in the Bible. Its got a very miniscule amount of a Biblical base to it, but it strays so far out there that its unrecognizable from anything you'd find in the Bible. Personally, I don't care about that, a movie is just a story to me. I just want people who might care about Biblical accuracy to know that this movie will not be anything they would care for.
Personally, I liked the first Omega Code better. The acting was good in it. Not great, but it wasn't horrible either. It was decent, and I liked the storyline alot better. That one is buyable, but this 2nd Omega Code movie is not worth the money to buy.",1059177600,2,1277,4.195121951219512

Why only 2 stars?  Simply put:  what in the world is the movie about?  If the producers feel that they are being faithful to Scripture, then they need help, badly.  This movie's plotline wanders pretty far afield from anything I have ever read in the Bible, no matter how many drinks I have had beforehand.

1669324,5,B00005UWBG,"Megiddo is considered the sequel to ""The Omega Code"". This film was released to a Christian audience shortly after the September 11th attack in 2001. A striking film, it is full of intense drama  and special effects, enhanced by computer graphics. Megiddo follows the tradition of Apocaylptic literature, such as the Christian novels of the ""Apocaylpse"" series, with prophetic, end of the world themes that resonate in the pages of the symbolic book of Revelation. Although I am not a fundamentalist, and prefer to see the future in brighter and more peaceful prospects, I liked the brilliant direction on this film, the powerful drama and the visual effects. Similar to Stephen King novels in some respects, or at least the ""Omen"" film series, it is nevertheless an interesting work of fiction, grounded on the fears that we have about the end of the world.
Michael York (Basil from the Austin Powers films and a distinguished British stage and film actor) portrays the Anti-Christ. He is Stone Alexander, a handsome, wealthy Italian an heir to his father's massive industry and fortune. When he was a young boy, his mother died giving birth to his brother David Stone. Jealous and possessed by the Devil, he attempts to destroy David. The sibling rivalry theme is not a surprise, for it has appeared in various films and guises ever since the brother-against-brother story of Cain and Abel. Stone is trained in the military but succumbs to the dark powers of the Devil and raises as an Anti-Christ. He is Damian from the Omen with a different, restrained and elegant kind of evil, much like Anthony Hopkins in Silence Of The Lambs. Getting on people's good sides, bringing about world peace and end to various problems as disease and world hunger, he has many nations on his side. But his brother David looks beyond the facade and realizes he is a threat. For some reason, they throw in a love story. David has always loved the Italian beauty, Gabriella, but it is Stone who marries her. The Devil in love ? Very unrealistic. The nations gather to make war in the Middle East and then God triumphantly destroys the dark forces, even in military fashion, and chains the Devil in hell.
Although these fundamentalist images of the end of the world are fantasy, they are very striking as a film. I hope that the real Devil of human intolerance and human's inhumanity to each other is truly destroyed by the actions of noble hearted and compassionate people who serve each other and are not power-corrupted. Perhaps one day, there will be peace and such disastrous imagery as end of the world will never even come about. The film's only significant line is Gabriella saying
""Even God cannot force us to do good.. we must do good"".",1051228800,2,2727,4.789808917197452
1669325,2,B00005UWBG,"That is exactly how I felt when I finished watching this film. I bought it as a gift for a friend in Canada and regretted spending the money on it.
This film was hyped up to be something that it is not - a revelation of the Revelations. It seemed to spend its time trying to find an identity. At one stage I thought it was trying to be like the Omen - but it just couldn't pull it off.  If this were written by Stephen King for example, it would have been better written for a start, but it also would not have tried so hard to convince everyone of it's authority.
I'm sorry, I am not usually this hard on anything I've read or watched, but this was very dissapointing. It didn't know where it was going, I didn't care about the characters, the plot was all over the place and it explained nothing. Perhaps the reason for my reaction to this film is because it tried so hard to convince me of its importance. If it didn't try so hard, it might not have bothered me so much......  Everything people write of make films etc about end time prophecies is subjective. Since only God knows the truth, humanity will just have to wait and see!
If you want a clearer depiction of end time prophecies watch and read the Left Behind series. The ending to the book 'Israel, My Beloved', by Kay Arthur gives a much better picture of end time events in one chapter, than the whole of this film!!!
The best way to make a judgement about any film or book is to view/read it yourself. Please do so, but not because you want to find answers. Besides, there are worse ways to spend a few hours.",1040169600,3,1575,4.211920529801325
1669326,2,B00005UWBG,"The ambition surrounding this project is really funny. I think that to shoot a screenplay like this one, there should be at least 200 million dolars available, instead of the low budget this movie got... Let's see why:
The plot is about a HUGE war between China / United States / ""THe Latins""  VERSUS EUROPEAN UNION. THis alone would deserve expert special effects.
THere's also special effects when Satan appears. There's world wide caos going on.
Also, the movie spans a fifty-years period of time...
The good point is to see that people still give leading roles to old actors. Michael York (one of the co-producers) is strong some kind of spiritual and political leader. David Hedison surprised me. He's still strong (I was always a fan of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA). Michael Biehn's career is going downhill since, whatever the reasons, he is not included anymore in James Cameron's projects, but here he tries his best.

And Michael York seemed like such a likeable bloke in 3 MUSKETEERS and the AUSTIN POWERS movies. Now with THE OMEGA CODE and MEGIDDO Michael has been exposed as the satanic fiend he is! Shame Michael shame!! I'm kidding of course. This is a vast improvement on THE OMEGA CODE. Thanks to TOC's success this follow up was made. It's not really a sequel, more a different movie altogether with Yorks's Stone Alexander character the only binding between the two movies. (Plotwise the two don't really mesh together well) Here he has become the most powerful man in history, a living god who has almost achieved his vision of one world which will be fair for everybody, of course all of his sheep lap it all up like the mindless fools they are. The only people standing in his way are the Chinese and US Presidents.
Amazingly, the US President (Michael Biehn) is Stone's brother (only in America!). All this leads up to a one on one conflict blah blah. MEGIDDO is far better than OMEGA CODE... MEGIDDO is glorified straight to video garbage with a larger budget and better visual effects which will appeal to action and sci-fi fans (strangely, the FX budget must have expired before they could fix up Biehn's receeding hairline)...",1033430400,7,1343,4.670886075949367

1669329,3,B00005UWBG,"I had waited ever so eagerly to see this film, but it was nowhere near the Biblical blockbuster that I had hoped to see.
Whilst appreciating that any subject relating to Biblical prophecy must be a very difficult theme to tackle and convert into a film, there is far too much missing here for it to have the credibility & detail that really shown have blown an audience's mind at this moment in time.
There is no reference to the Rapture or the 'Mark of the Beast'.
The central role of Jerusalem, The Temple and Israel in end times events receives hardly any mention whatsoever. With these subjects being vital to any interpretation of end time prophecies their absence is disturbing.
I appreciate that Megiddo is in Israel, (I have actually visited the scene), but the less informed would perhaps miss even this factor due to the lack of reference and detail.
I applaud those concerned for tackling this subject. The public really need an awesome, epic publication along these lines. A film that can stand scrutiny, ooze truth & integrity and grab the attention. One that can really attract and inform the masses as we approach the actual time period itself. The world is crying out for such a film.
Please try again and concentrate on the prophecies, inform the viewers of the actual prophecies themselves and their context and then base the characters around them. I have studied Biblical prophecy for a number of years but whilst watching this film I found myself guessing at times as to what exactly was being referred to.",1031270400,2,1527,4.7443609022556394
1669330,1,B00005UWBG,"What in the world does this movie have to do with God, Christianity, or the Bible? Its seems as though the makers of the film took the book of Revelation out of the Bible and molded it into something of their own morbid creation. This movie is right up there with Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, and The Exorcist. So much for ""This is God's answer to 9/11""! So much for ""This person got saved and that person got saved from seeing this movie""! this movie and it's predecessor, The Omega Code, are both pieces of unscriptural garbage! Neither of them accurately depict end-time events as depicted in Revelation. In fact, they leave out so much stuff that it's amazing. There is no Rapture, no Mark of the Beast, no 21 judgments, no Abomination of Desolation, or any of those other pivotal events of prophecy as foretold in the Bible. Furthermore, there are no references to God, Jesus Christ, the Gospel, or the importance of repenting and getting saved. This movie does well to be classified as a horror movie. Any little kids who see it are bound to have nightmares. The scene where Stone Alexander spews hordes of locusts from his mouth and the other scene where he turns into Satan are absolutely creepy! Anyone who is wise will steer clear of this TBN-produced hogwash! It shouldn't be surprising, since TBN's programming is for the most part heretical and blasphemous. And by the way, I don't think Left Behind is anything worth while, either.",1030320000,6,1443,4.68503937007874
1669331,4,B00005UWBG,"Having seen many of the reviews for this film and being a script-writer, i think i can offer some guidance.
  First off, I have seen written that the acting for these roles is rediculous.  It must be noted that the anti-christ will be genuinely arragant and an ego-mainiac, and York portrays this well.
  Another complaint is the dialogue.  I only found one truly poor piece of dialogue, spoken by Beihn, ""The Lord he gives, (cocks gun) the Lord he takes away, "" which was somewhat inappropriate for the setting. There was, however, a great line of dialogue for York's Anti-christ.  When Beihn's character states, ""You don't have a chance in hell.""  York states, with
emphasis, ""Oh, I always have a chance in hell, david.""  Very well done.  Special effects were almost always good or better,
although ""Satan"" was obviously CGI created.
  I believe the main thing that fought against this film was the first Omega Code film.  The first one was honestly, almost laughable, the dialogue was rediculous constantly.  This film was truly better and it would have fared much better, if it has been released or made first, and the original ""omega Code"" would have fared better being released second, even though it is sub-par.  This is sad, for this second film is a big step up in every department.  It is, at the least, a big step in the right direction.
  I would certainly recommend it to people.  I would caution parents, concerning the satanic rights sequences, as they could be deemed intense.",1028246400,8,1492,4.780392156862745
1669332,2,B00005UWBG,"Over the last few years, mainstream Christianity has reached out to America with the usual intention to prepare the world for the Last Days.  THE OMEN started the trend with LEFT BEHIND following.  Now there is MEGIDDO: THE OMEGA CODE 2, which has all the flaws of both but few of the virtues of either.  My problem with MEGIDDO has little to do with how one interprets the Bible but everything to do with cinematic craftsmanship.  Regardless of the topic, I expect the director to present an internally consistent point of view with one plot element logically leading to the next.  If he wants to crib from earlier movies as his use of the young Stone Alexander as the newest reincarnation of Damien from THE OMEN 2, that's fine, but I insist that the production qualities not be so shabby as to intrude.  Sadly, in MEGIDDO, there is plenty of blame to pass around.  First, there is the hammy acting of Michael York, who plays Stone as an anti-Christ who insists on the audience's verbal recognition of him as such with his constant use of quote from Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' and his penchant for a sonorous pseudo-Biblical method of oration that invests each phrase with a many layered religious subtext.  Michael Biehn, who was was so convincing in THE TERMINATOR, has forgotten how to act without somehow getting physical in the process.  Diane Venora, who plays Stone's wife Gabriella, is surprisingly effective as the long suffering wife who only slowly comes to realize that her husband of many years is not what he seems.  The best part of the film was the chronicling of the growth and rise to power of Stone.  It is only after his ascension to power as the head of the New World Union that the story goes seriously astray.  I do not believe that the FBI can show up at the White House with an arrest warrant for the President as was done in this film.  Nixon and Clinton could probably attest to that.  Then there is the battle scene between the union of the Latin and Chinese armies against Stone's army at Jerusalem.  I truly did not understand how and to what extent the United States army under the command of the new and illegal President fit into the military scheme of things.  The battle scenes were a jumble in which it was impossible to tell who was fighting whom.  Finally, there was the illogic of the demonic supernatural. If Stone could cause a vast plague of locusts to fly out of his mouth to attack Beijing, then why could he not do the same when the Chinese/Latin tank armies miraculously appeared out of nowhere to wind up in Jerusalem?  The defeat of Stone, who by the end stands revealed as some sort of winged, horned Bible devil, does not ring true.  If his nemesis, The Nazerene (the good angel--I think) could blast the ranks of Stone's army in much the same way that Byron describes in the poem 'The Destruction of Sennacherib' then one might wonder why did this Nazerene wait so long?
  MEGIDDO: THE OMEGA CODE 2 is the kind of movie that is geared for an audience that is Bible-based and seeks to know that the events hinted at in Revelation are nigh.  Plagues, earthquakes, famine and the rise of the anti-Christ may indeed be nigh, but movies like this one do not present a convincing case that there is a connection between what the Bible suggests God wants and what this movie delivers.",1027987200,2,3333,4.585160202360877
1669333,5,B00005UWBG,"I liked Omega Code but after hearing about a sequel/remake I was skeptical because any sequel,
  especially a sequel to a Christian movie is bound to not be as good as the first one. Though I was VERY surprised
  with what I saw in Meggido. The storyline included more biblical concepts than the first and the storyline was better. It
  seemed they rushed things just a little bit in places. I think they should've showed Antichrit's grip on the world more
  and David's salvation seemed rushed and it surprised me that he got saved after hearing a few passages out the Second
  Coming out of the bible. But the effects in this movie are absolutely amazing! They're just as good as any other movie
  out there. Armegddon is so real it'll keep u on the edge of your seat. The only special effects shot I didn't like was hell, it looked kind of fake but Satan looked so real. This
  movie is said to be the best apocalyptic movie ever made, which is what they said about Left Behind, which was a
  bunch of baloney, but it's true about this movie. This is a must get movie to add to your collection and if you're still
  skeptical you can always rent it.",1026259200,6,1152,4.35377358490566

was Depected very well it was just like how the Bible described
it. And the Battle scenes where great you would think you where
watching Breaking News coverage of  a war with Iraq on CNN.They
where that well done. And the movie answered a lot of questions

1669335,3,B00005UWBG,"2 reasons why I would watch Megiddo.
 1) It's a movie about Revelations - that's cool.
 2) The battle of Armageddon was nice.  Not as intense as battles from Lord of the Rings, We Were Soldiers, etc., but, it was an epic battle scene. What can I say? It's good!

The problem with this movie is it runs the middle. The fighting is better in other movies (as listed above) while the plot does not as biblical as movies like Left Behind.
One last thing... If you are deciding between this and Omega Code, skip Omega code. It doesn't contribute much to the plot and is not nearly as good.
Ultimatly, if you want to see it, I suggest renting the movie, but not buying it.",1024963200,,666,4.261904761904762
1669336,1,B00005UWBG,"For a film about the true 'drama of the ages', Megiddo misses the mark almost completely.  This is not because of a limited budget or marginal acting: Megiddo does well here on both counts.
Michael Biehn and Michael York are both talented actors, and aren't just 'play acting' in front of the blue screen.  They give fine performances- -especially York (who has the unfortunate task of playing the Anti-Christ).  The failure of Megiddo lies mainly in the hands of its writers, who put forth such bloated, outlandish storyline that was is factual seems fictional.  Characterization is all but exempt, with the exception of York's ""Stone Alexander"".  But then, do we really want to get inside the head of the devil-in-the-flesh ?  This is like wanting to preheat a microwave oven.  What's the point ?  But no !  The writers of Megiddo want us to see it all, and so the viewer is subjected to seeing young Stone putting a lit match in his brother's crib !
There are ways of portraying utter evil, but the Megiddo writers succeed only in offending with this obese monstrosity.  What could have been an incredible witnessing tool is reduced to incoherent nonsense.  That is the real tragedy of this film.",1023667200,4,1199,4.771844660194175
1669337,4,B00005UWBG,". . .and we all feel fine.  But should we?
Meggido, for those that have not seen the film or read Revelations, is the plain where the final battle will take place.  The movie tells a fictionalized account of a near future that pretty closely follows the book of Revelations.  I was honestly impressed with the quality of the film, mainly because I had set my standard pretty low given the negative reviews.  The story was very refreshing and different.  Looking back, I think the ""refreshing"" aspect came from the fact that the movie was based on Truths that are not often (if ever) brought out in mainstream media.  This movie, while made from a Christian perspective, does not attempt to hammer you over the head with it.  It actually contains more satanic rituals, blood, demons, and gore than I would ever expect.  The movie presents the rise of the anti-Christ and the world events that lead to our near-destruction in a straightforward manner.  As you might expect from a movie that deals with the end of the world, there was a fair share of violence, so the movie may be too strong for young kids (or squeamish adults).  That being said, I don't think it was violent enough.  Read Revelations and you will see the true horror (and eventual Salvation) that awaits.
As far as movie-making, I was surprised most by the sets, which were rich, opulent, and well-done.  The CGI special effects  were good (not completely state of the art, but very good nonetheless).  Many of the action sequences, however, suffered from what I call ""A-Team"" syndrome.  The battles were better when viewed from afar with CGI painting the magic instead of up-close.  Though I am a Christian, I haven't seen many ""Christian"" movies because, in all honesty, most of them are not very good movies.  This one is an exception, which I would recommend to anyone.  While not the end-all-be-all of movies, it is the best Christian movie I've seen out there.  My wife's stern review was ""I didn't hate it,"" which, trust me, coming from her, is pretty close to a thumbs up.
The acting was very good all around.  Michael York (of ""Logan's Run"" fame) played the anti-Christ and did an incredible job with his role, which was a difficult one.  He successfully portrayed the incredible magnetism and charisma that the leader that will unite mankind will no doubt have.  It was interesting (and frightening) to hear in so many of his speeches the very same words many of the world's leaders are using today in the name of freedom and peace.  Micheal Biehn (the good guy in the first ""Terminator"") was also very good, playing the President we all wish we would have.  He showed strength, courage, and, most importantly, humility in his character.
So how close are we to The End?  Who knows?  No one does, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  However, the fact that we can imagine scenarios based on the current events unfolding before us is an indication that it is near.  The pieces are falling into place.  It is said that only the last generation will understand the book of Revelations completely.  I believe we are coming close to that understanding.",1022544000,5,3123,4.708487084870849

Now I'm not saying beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is flawless in every way. I didn't look at this movie as the source for my belief. I view it as ENTERTAINMENT!

Things left out that should have been discussed, were the Rapture of the church, more of God's judgements, and the Mark of the Beast.

7955727,4,B00005UWBG,"The apocalypse has proved to be a popular recurring theme in the world of fiction. The idea of some lone group of intrepid survivors being forced to endure the new and terrifying dangers of a world gone mad has thrilled audiences time and time again, and has seen a resurgence as of late what with the recent flood of dystopian YA fiction (i.e. The Hunger Games, Divergent, The 5th Wave) and the Best Picture-nominated Mad Max Fury Road, a personal favourite of mine. Phrases like Orwellian, Big Brother, and Thoughtcrime have entered the vernacular, and ideas behind dystopian and apocalyptic literature continue to resonate with generation after generation. The Left Behind series of novels helped to popularise the once-controversial Evangelical ideas of eschatology (the theological study of the Biblical End Times) in the slick, technology-driven Y2K age, the unknowns of the encroaching new millennium creating widespread speculation about potential natural phenomena, war, famine, plagues, economic and technological meltdown, societal collapse, and other assorted disasters. One of the films riding off this best-selling wave of success was The Omega Code, a decidedly underwhelming premillenialist take on the Clancy/Crichton/Brown airport conspiracy thriller bankrolled by Christian media giant Trinity Broadcasting Network (think Disney as run by televangelists). Released two years later, Megiddo largely abandons its status as a continuation of the original, instead fully embracing all the absurdities of its genre and namesake. The end result is one I can best describe as Command & Conquer: War of the Antichrist. Australian exploitation auteur Brian Trenchard-Smith (Turkey Shoot, The Man From Hong Kong) utilizes the fairly low (by Hollywood standards) $20 million budget well (aside from some jarringly conspicuous use of stock footage and questionable CGI) and gives the film a genuine sense of scope. The sheer scale of the climactic battle at the eponymous Israeli city is truly impressive considering the films humble origins. Fellow B-movie maestro John Fasanos (Rockn Roll Nightmare, Another 48 Hours, Universal Soldier: The Return) screenplay holds a fairly loose grip on the materials theology, but this only helps to elevate the films appeal. This is a world of inverted crosses, Antichrists with psychic powers, Biblical prophecies, and demonic guardians. Rather than trying to downplay the absurdity, this film chooses to amplify it and play it up to its full potential.

This is a film that does NOT take itself seriously, and is made much better for it. Fans of genre cinema will be pleased to see recognizable cast of familiar faces, including Michael Biehn (Aliens, The Terminator), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket), Diane Venora (Heat, Romeo+Juliet), David Hedison (The Fly), Udo Kier (Too Many To Count), and Franco Nero (also too many to count). But standing out above the rest is Michael York as the Antichrist himself. The English acting legend gives what is hands down one of the single hammiest performances ever committed to celluloid. Should anyone ask me for one good reason why they should consider watching this film, I would confidently respond with Michael York. The sheer over-the-top brilliance of his acting can not be put into words. Nothing I can say will accurately capture even a small fraction of how melodramatically bonkers he is. Every syllable of every line is delivered with such grandiose relish its impossible to not be entranced any time hes on screen. A quintessential cinematic Satan to be sure.

This film represents the sum total of the End Times sub-genre, a movie that doesnt try to take itself seriously and as a result, is better off for it. A highly recommend it to anyone with even a remote interest in genre cinema, so bad, its good movies, and in general anyone looking for two hours of cheesy, entertaining goodness.",1480636800,,3893,5.27741935483871
