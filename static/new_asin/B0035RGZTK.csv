8429807,5,B0035RGZTK,I've been looking for this for years. My old one was worn out. Glad I bought it.,1515801600,,80,3.764705882352941
8429808,4,B0035RGZTK,"My VHS copy of ""Silent Night, Holy Night"" is old to the point of constantly pushing the tracking button, so I purchased this one. The quality is better than mine, although the film did shake for only a few seconds. I fear that is the nature of all VHS tapes as their quality is just not as good as DVDs (the brief shakiness could be our VCR as well as that has been around for several years). It is a good cartoon and there is a bonus cartoon called ""The Candlemaker,"" which is another old cartoon that conveys an edifying story.",1514764800,,529,4.247524752475248
8429809,5,B0035RGZTK,"I teach Music to grades K through 5. I love to show this movie to my students during class just before Christmas break. It is the story of how the song Silent Night came to be written. It is in cartoon form, but done very well. It holds their attention and the children look forward to seeing it each year. So do I!",1479340800,,315,4.015873015873016
