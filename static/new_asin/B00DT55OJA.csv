5854122,5,B00DT55OJA,"Awesome show, I bought the 10 years red vs blue bluray anniversary edition. This season 11 was freakin' sick for an intro episode. Recommend this to anyone who is OG",1387152000,,165,4.533333333333333
5854123,5,B00DT55OJA,I really can only rate on the buying and shipping as this is a Christmas gift a Marine son serving oversees and won't be back to base until December 22.  They reminded me that it was available (he has the first 10 seasons) and we received it within a week.,1386460800,2,256,4.12
5854124,5,B00DT55OJA,"you know, I thought miles would not do a good job with this season. yea, sounds a bit negative, but i had never seen anything by him. at least nothing big. I have to give it up to him. this season was funny and serious. it opens the series up to a new arc in the story. don't wanna spoil but there will be twists. definitely recomend this series. doesnt matter if you're a new fan or been around since the first blood gulch season. this is a really good series and addition.",1385856000,3,474,4.10752688172043
5854125,5,B00DT55OJA,"Its Red vs Blue returned to its roots, same loveable characters, new story-line. I'm assuming if your looking to get season 11, you've already seen a fair amount of RvB, and know what to expect: a perfect blend of comedy and an enticing plot....

(For New Viewers)

Red vs Blue is the longest running web-series of ever...of all time. As a personal note: don't be deterred by not having seen the past 10 seasons I started watching this at season 6. I went back to watch the other seasons not because I was lost but because I wanted to see more, new people can feel free to skip the first 5 without being completely lost (but may want to watch them after for the fun of it). Season 11 can be watched stand-alone but after 11 full seasons there are multiple references to past seasons, and you may be left with a feeling of not understanding.

(Summary)

After finally putting a stop to project freelancer, the Reds and Blues crash land in the middle of a box canyon and need to establish a radio signal to send for a rescue, but they may not be the only ones on this planet. With new enemies waiting in the shadows, a new plot unfolds as the galaxy's worst soldiers are at it again.

(Details)

For the veterans of this web-series: this season of RvB goes back to basics. There is no CG in this season, all video is made from the Halo engine. The fact that there is no CG does not make this season in ANY way inferior to past the last 3, one of the great things about Rooster Teeth is that they can make anything work in a video game. Battle scenes are just as epic as they were in CG.

(Final)

Last note to summarize this, if your a past RvB fan, you know what to expect. If your new to this series, it's definitely not too late to start watching.",1384560000,18,1748,4.228228228228228
5854126,5,B00DT55OJA,"It's an amazing series and as a huge fan of Rooster Teeth Productions, I personally think it's the best show ever... This season had a lot of cliffhangers and unexpected discoveries in every corner of an episode. I have all the seasons and as long as RT keeps making them, I'll buy them. This DVD is worth it.... Then again everything Rooster Teeth make's is worth it, Red vs. Blue is the best Web-series Ever... Of all time!!!",1383782400,2,427,4.487179487179487
5854127,4,B00DT55OJA,"Continuing a good series, this season was really good and was interesting to see the other characters.... On their own....

5854136,5,B00DT55OJA,"Along with the wit and humor I have come to expect from Red vs Blue, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the storytelling in the later seasons, especially the last four seasons (seasons 10-13). My teenage kids love this series, and I was very happy to find something that we all could enjoy watching together. This just happened to be the first season of RvB we watched. Since watching volume/season 11, I went back and watched all the previous seasons with my kids, and RvB became a source of tons of laughs and something fun for my kids and I to joke about, discuss together, and just enjoy watching together. We have now watched all episodes through season 12 and are halfway through season 13, the final season. We are really looking forward to seeing how this series ends!",1454198400,,786,4.581560283687943

5854152,4,B00DT55OJA,"A very interesting new look to the amazing series red vs blue. Sets place in Halo 4, better sound, visuals, and scripts. However the only part I have against it is the overuse of CG. It was fine in seasons 9-10 because you couldn't really tell the project freelancer story without CGI. But it's not very necessary for this season. It ruined the movie in a few parts. But all-in-all, definitely worth adding it to your Red vs Blue Collection!",1440979200,,441,4.525

With that being said if you have never seen any of the previous seasons you might want to check out the webpage Rooster Teeth  first to see if its for you and then start at season 1. Also if you are looking for an action packed halo 3d type movie you might want to look else where. This show is basically video game footage from Halo with a rather hilarious story and dialogue thrown into it. Cant wait for season 13 to hit amazon",1440115200,,581,4.2342342342342345

Season 6 was my all-time favorite and when I found out they were continuing the series after the 10th I was really excited. Unfortunately it appears that the majority of the talent that used to go into Red vs Blue is now being used in other areas. Where before there were story arcs and some character development, I now feel that all the characters are completely static (if not having reverted back to the stereotypes each character started out as in Season 1) and the story is entirely composed of plot points that make you go, huh? It just goes to show how audiences can change over time since, based on all the positive reviews, there is an audience that's perfectly happy with this season.

I've never had this before, seriously.  The DVD menus are awful.  They run poorly, the selection options don't always select what you're choosing, it takes 2-3 seconds for the menu to respond to what your doing with your remote.  I've never had this happen with a DVD but it makes using the menus terrible!  The other 17 DVDs I have from RoosterTeeth aren't like this, but this Season 11 Blu-ray is just ...weird!  Whatever they did to the menus on this, I hope they don't do it again.  It's frustrating as heck!

That being said, the season itself was wonderful and I loved it as always!

5854326,5,B00DT55OJA,"Let me preface this review with this I will do everything I can to remain spoiler free.

  I have roosterteeth on my youtube subscription and saw that they released a teaser for ssn 12. I was blown away that I had forgot about them and felt compelled to rewatch EVERYTHING and catch up on everything I missed as well.

  As I mindlessly indulged I noticed that the writing had definitely evolved past just humor (which is still great for fans of the series) to actual plot devices and character developments. Between the mind eff's of the recollection collection to the epic scope of the freelancer collection, its easy to see how ssn 11 can initially come off as...a step back.

  Church (Alpha, Epsilon, The Director or whomever you want to call him) had been in the spotlight for a great deal of time. I never noticed it until viewing this season. This was a chance to hit refresh on the old RvB dynamic without it feeling like a reboot. But this wasn't just a refresh for the audience or for RT but for the folks of Blood Gulch Alpha 1 and Wash.

  What more can I say? I'm amped up for ssn 12, and the build up for the future is ambiguous and foreboding for the RvB teams.",1396742400,,1177,4.348623853211009

5854343,5,B00DT55OJA,"Hilarious as always.

Season 1 set the bar for laughs, while every year the complexity and richness of the storyline has gotten ever deeper.  2 & 3 set the foundation for what has become a compelling science fiction saga, while struggling to meet the high bar for laughter set by Season 1.  In 4 - 10 the writing gets better and better, both for humor and great story telling, not to mention the ever increasing epic-ness of the animation and action sequences.

In season 11, Burnie Burns and Co (Rooster Teeth), start us off anew.  Many of the old plot lines have been settled, but the Red & Bue teams are now stranded on an unknown planet, hopelessly alone (or are they?).  Shipwrecked, Church & Agent Carolina have seemingly abandoned the crew while boredom leads to the hilarious renewal of old feuds (thanks Sarge!), much to the exasperation of poor Washington, who desperately attempts to maintain order while bringing communications back on line to call in a rescue ship.

We return to the old school console based machinima in the much improved visual treat that is the Halo universe.  Caboose is funnier than ever, and the rest of the gang is great as well.

I'm truly amazed at how consistently well the comic writing, acting, editing, etc. has been done in RvB over the years..  Another gem.",1390608000,4,1302,4.6960352422907485

Though they do talk a lot about the mechanics behind machina, and other computer stuff that I have no understanding of. I was more interested in the story plot and character development discussion.
