8366520,5,B000L4AGHW,"Don't let the cover fool you - Busey is the peaceful hippie trying not to get in too deep and Scott Glenn is the hard, quiet biker keeping his emotions close to the vest. Like many biker films from this period it's violent and low budget looking, but it's got a good story and solid acting from all the major players. A nice alternative to the slick, multi-million dollar movies at the theaters today.",1398902400,,401,4.4324324324324325
