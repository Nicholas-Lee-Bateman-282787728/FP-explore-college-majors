6495032,5,B00LOCLBQU,Wasn't a big fan of the Yu-Gi-Oh GX series; the original will always be the best but I will probably get these seasons because I did like the duels and the story but if Yu-Gi-Oh 5DS gets released I probably won't get it.,1404950400,,220,4.1395348837209305

6495047,5,B00LOCLBQU,"This is my review from tv.com

I love this series so much my favorite Duel Set is Elemental Heroes and my dinosaur pets in World of Warcraft are named after Tyranno Kenzan (Tyranno Hassleberry in the English dub). The show is about a school for Duel Monsters and the Slifer Red student, Jaden Yuki.

While Jaden's not as serious as Yami Yugi from the original, they both strongly value friendship which allows Jaden to have many friends.

While the series started out humorous, the series got darker as the seasons went.

One of the reasons I started hating 4Kids is when they canceled GX prematurely to start with 5Ds, which also ended prematurely.",1418601600,2,649,4.716814159292035
6495048,1,B00LOCLBQU,"The video quality on these are crap compared to the older individual DVD's that were released.

They cropped and resized this poorly and as a result the lines are blurred and so is the overall picture. The details are also smudged looking.

Look at these screenshot comparisons.

I carefully examined the new Yu-Gi-Oh! GX DVD's that came out and compared them with the older DVD's and this is the conclusion I have come to.

The older DVD's have the better picture in my opinion. They cropped the new ones so you lose some picture from the top, because of the way they did this, some details and or lines in alot of the video have become blurred. It looks smudged instead of clear as a result. The only thing that's possibly better in these new DVD's is the colors, its all personal preference. Other than that, the older DVD's beat them quality wise in my opinion and the screenshots will prove it.

Heres a few examples and comparisons showing what I'm talking about.

This is easier to see if you save each picture individually and then rapidly flip back and forth through them.

In this example its easiest to see if you look at the numbers on the bottom of the cards. You will notice in the old DVD's they look nice, in the new DVD's, their blurred and look a bit see through. This happens ALOT on these new DVD's, this isn't just a few scenes or areas, its for the entire video length that it does this in different areas. It made the characters lips look like there's no line between them, it made lines thicker and blurry like in the numbers on these cards.

Again heres another example where details got blurred. It's easiest to see if you look at the guys face on the Draining Shield card in this set of cards.

Here is another example of what I am talking about. Its easiest to see in this example if you stare at Dr. Crowlers lips and flip through them. They are very blurred and it looks horrible in comparison.

So the good news is, we have new DVD's to work with and they may at least give us Season 1-3 on DVD. The bad news is, the older DVD's have better video quality, and they only ever released Season 1 for those",1416441600,,2379,4.6819277108433734
6495049,5,B00LOCLBQU,What a good start to Yu-Gi-Oh GX I can't wait for the release of the second and third season. But it still can not beat the oringal  Yu-Gi-Oh series.,1416182400,,149,4.137931034482759

6495051,2,B00LOCLBQU,I love the series but the first disc in the second set had a lot of skips when it came to zane's duel and jaden's duel against camula.,1413936000,,134,3.8214285714285716
6495052,5,B00LOCLBQU,"I like the fact that I could see Jaden & his friends again because I think that the last time I watched Yugioh GX was 6 years ago, so it was fun to watch all of the duels from the first season again, I think the last time I first watched the entire first season of Yugioh GX was on TV (Miguzi on Cartoon Network) around 10 years ago.",1413936000,3,333,3.8405797101449277

6495058,5,B00LOCLBQU,"Worthy sequel to the original, Great main character

A few years after the original series ended, the main rival in the original series (Kaiba) set up an entire academy to learn the ins and outs of dueling. The main character in GX is Jaden Yuki, a die hard gung ho fanatic about the game who is a student at the academy. At first it's about him proving himself to snobbish students and professors, but soon Jaden has protect the world just as Yugi/Pharoah did in the original series.",1408233600,2,484,4.5
6495059,5,B00LOCLBQU,"Finally, the collection we've all been waiting for since this show first aired so long ago! I'm glad to see that after finishing up the release of the original run of the show they have decided to release GX as a complete season, especially for the obscene amount of money people are asking for the 6 episode per DVD sets (Vol. 4 School Duel is going for $100 at MINIMUM!!) I look forward to the release of season 2, 3, 4 and so on!",1407974400,14,432,4.154761904761905

6495061,4,B00LOCLBQU,"Can't wait to get it. Now I'll see why people give GX so much flack. Being a fan of the original animes, minus Zexal, & the Yugioh & GX abridged series', I've had a good time watching the horribly-scripted dubbed episodes (seriously, if they had better & more accurate scripts, 4Kids wouldn't have gotten as much flack as they got because the cast was all right for what they had in terms of nonunion actors) of the original series & laughing along the way & I can't wait to rewatch this series & see the parts I missed. I'll give a more in-depth review when I get & watch the set.

8667174,1,B00LOCLBQU,"Sorry but the American versions of this show are completely passable. I don't say that about any other animes either. It is notoriously edited shows ever released. Aside from the hundreds of edited cards, censored dialogue, stupid stuff like people blushing, possible death scenes, the last season of GX never saw the light of day in the US. Highly recommend subbed sites till a propper release. (Same repeats with the original show, 5d, Zexal, and now more than likely Arc V)",1465603200,,476,4.888888888888889
