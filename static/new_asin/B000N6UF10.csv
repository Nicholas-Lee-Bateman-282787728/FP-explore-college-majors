2757228,5,B000N6UF10,"I can't wait for season 2 of F Troop!  I am glad that there are enough of us out there who bought season 1 that the studio is putting out season 2.  With the upcoming release of McHale's Navy season 1 and Wild, Wild West season 2, this is going to be a 60's retro spring for me.

The second season of F Troop includes some great guest stars, with the Vincent Price episode being my favorite.  Sad that with over 60 cable channels at my disposal, I spend most of my TV watching time with these old series.",1173484800,14,504,4.0606060606060606
2757229,5,B000N6UF10,I grew up with this TV show. I purchased season 1 a year ago. I am looking forward to buying season 2. It is too bad they ended the series. It had a lot of potential.,1173312000,6,166,3.638888888888889
2757230,5,B000N6UF10,"I am a huge fan of ""F Troop"" and loved the Complete First Season box set. My dad really loved it. Over the course of a week or two, we went through the entire season, laughing hysterically all the way. Just as we will with this one.

This show is an undisputed classic. As well as unappreciated and woefully undershown these days. TV Land has become a sad joke, showing nothing but lousy '80 junk like ""Knight Rider"", ""The A-Team"" and ""MacGiver"". As well as more lousy '70's cheese like ""Happy Days"", ""Diff'rent Strokes"" and ""Soap"". And they're trying to sneak in some '90's crap with ""Wings"". Hardly classics.

But anyway, I'm now all geared up for Season Two of ""F Troop"". I would say ""Bring on all the rest of the seasons"", but sadly, this is the final one. One of those two-season gems, along with ""The Munsters"", which, I guess were just too good for television. We'll never see their like again.

And that's sad.",1172880000,43,918,4.485029940119761

2757484,5,B000N6UF10,"Though it only lasted two seasons, ""F Troop"" is rightfully regarded as one of the best sitcoms of the sixties, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast.  Ken Berry played the klutzy Captain Wilton Parmenter, who was promoted for his on-field heroics.  Forrest Tucker played the scheming Sergeant Morgan O'Rourke, in the grand tradition of Phil Silvers' scheming Sergeant Ernie Bilko.  Larry Storch played Corporal Randolph Agarn to comic perfection.  A gifted mimic, he also played his Mexican bandito cousin Pancho Agarnado in the first season, as well as his French-Canadian cousin Lucky Pierre, and his Russian cousin Dmitri Agarnoff, in season two.  James Hampton played Private Hannibal Dobbs, a bugler who couldn't play a melody to save his life.  Joe Brooks played Trooper Vanderbilt, the lookout who couldn't lookout for any obstacles in his way.  Bob Steele played Trooper Duffy, an older cavalryman who insisted that he fought at the Alamo.  Ivan Bell played Trooper Duddleson, the obese soldier who was asleep most of the time.  The Hekawi Indians, who were peaceful partners in O'Rourke Enterprises, were led by Chief Wild Eagle, played by Frank de Kova.  Don Diamond played Crazy Cat, the Chief's assistant, who will take over the tribe after Wild Eagle goes to the happy hunting ground.  Last but not least was the beautiful Melody Patterson, who played ""Wrangler"" Jane Angelica Thrift, who continually tried to wrangle Captain Parmenter to the altar.

The second season boasted great guest stars, such as Paul Lynde in ""The Singing Mountie,"" Harvey Korman in ""Bye, Bye Baloon,"" the gorgeous Julie Newmar in ""Yellow Bird,"" Henry Gibson in ""The Return Of Wrongo Starr,"" and Cliff Arquette (a/k/a/ Charlie Weaver) in ""Our Brave In F Troop.""  Being a major horror movie fan, my favorite episode is ""V Is For Vampire,"" starring the legendary Vincent Price.  The chemistry and comic timing of all of the main characters and various troopers is what made the show so great.  The first season's DVD set did not include any bonus features.  The second season does not include any cast commentaries or bloopers, but it does include the bonus feature ""Fall In With F Troop.""  People interviewed on camera include Ken Berry and Forrest Tucker's widow.  It also includes a brief audio interview of Joe Brooks, talking about Trooper Vanderbilt.  Although not available in Blu-ray, the colors are crisp, and the audio is clear.  What a shame that there was no third season for ""F Troop,"" and that most of the actors are up in that big Fort Courage in the sky.",1450742400,4,2587,5.0

There are a lot of references to ""Redskins"" and some painted up white actors playing Native Americans, so it doesn't meet today's levels of political correctness. If you can accept it as a product of its times you'll hopefully see past all that and laugh along at the antics of Captain Parameter and his troop.",1444089600,,547,4.525252525252525

2757535,4,B000N6UF10,"This underrated comedy was in the 1965-66 season and ran only two years. The first season in black and white and the second (this season) in color. It took place in a Union camp during the closing of the Civil War. It starred Ken Berry as Wilton Parmenter who was a bumbling private whose allergies caused him to sneeze that sounded like 'charge' which helped win a battle and promoted him to suddenly command F Troop at Fort Courage. There he met Sergeant Morgan O' Rourke played by Forrest Tucker, Corporal Randolph Agarn played by Larry Storch, and the beautiful Wrangler Jane played by Melody Patterson. The show dealt with O Rourke who was president of O Rourke enterprises, an illegal company dealing with Indian souvenirs who used the bumbling and clueless Parmenter as his patsy. It was a funny series that many people today don't remember like they do many other 60s comedies. There were some great guest appearances by Paul Lynde, MIlton Berle, Henry Gibson and even Vincent Price. the story was a bit complicated for an average TV comedy but it was clever. I don't know exactly what happened but I think the writing staff changed in the second season and the stories were just not as good as the first season. And with the complexity of the storylilnes it was finally axed after just two seasons. But this series is certainly good for laughs and slapstick humor. There were re-occuiring gags such as the lookout tower being blown down by a cannon and a blind lookout as well as an inept bugler. But working under the bubling but very lovable and forgiving Parmenter would have been a joy for most anyone. I wish more people discovered this comedy. It's funny, clever and family friendly. I used to watch it originally when I was in my early teens and I remembered enjoying it but it wasn't until it came out on DVD that I actually was able to see all of the episodes and remember how classic this show really is. I hope you also enjoy it.",1441584000,2,1949,4.571428571428571

But the worst part of the color format was leading to the wretched change to the opening theme. I know that the opening had to be in color if the show was, and the footage that was used in season 1 was probably only available in black & white, but the opening song (with singing--key point) with the hysterical footage that was used in season 1 was one of the best openings in all of TV history, and to butcher that with no singing and that idiotic cartoon was, to my mind, an unforgivable abomination.",1419292800,,717,4.279411764705882

2758019,4,B000N6UF10,"Returning for a second season, the military comedy F Troop appears geared up for success, as the budget seems to have been increased, the writing is a little stronger, and the program is definitely more impactful in color, and with a bold new opening credit sequence.

Stationed at Fort Courage, under the command of Captain Wilton Parmenter (Ken Berry,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mama-s-Family/dp/B00F3MP05U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mama's Family</a>),), the men of F Troop are charged with keeping the peace, but with only the harmless Hakawi tribe nearby, there is little threat of violence.  This gives Sergeant Morgan O'Rourke (Forest Tucker), and Corporal Randolph Agarn (Larry Storch), a free hand to operate ""O'Rourke Enterprises"", a business that runs the town saloon, and is in partnership with Hakawi Chief Wild Eagle (Frank De Kova).

The stories show a broadening in scope, featuring more locations outside of the fort, occasionally incorporating stock footage from various westerns.  While still concerned with the activities of O'Rourke and Agarn, there is less of an emphasis on their profit minded schemes.  Captain Parmenter remains clumsy, but is a lot smarter, and fortunately the multi-talented Ken Berry is given much more to do.  As the season progresses, more of the action centers around Agarn and Parmenter, the most naturally funny members in the cast.

Looking mature well beyond her 17 years, Melody Patterson looks quite stunning in color.  Patterson continues to be the aggressor in romance, as Parmenter's girlfriend Wrangler Jane, and the series would conclude, before she reached her 18th birthday.  The rest of the principal cast remains intact, with Private Dobbs (James Hampton), Trooper Duffy (Bob Steele), Trooper Vanderbilt (Joe Brooks), and Wild Eagle's second banana Crazy Cat (Don Diamond).

Highlights in this season include, ""That's Show Biz"", where Agarn quits the army to become the manager of a rock band, and Jane becomes a pop singer.  In ""From Karate With Love"", a Japanese woman takes refuge in Parmenter's quarters, much to the consternation of Wrangler Jane.  Horror icon Vincent Price, appears as a creepy newcomer to town, in ""V For Vampire"".  Ken Berry has a dual role in ""Wilton the Kid"", also playing a bank robber, and Larry Storch also assumes a dual role as a Russian officer who romances Jane, in ""Only One Russian is Coming! Only One Russian Is Coming!"".

With Arthur Julian assuming the primary writing duties, the stories in Season Two are stronger, as Storch and Berry assume more prominent roles.  With higher production values, F Troop looks much better, and is more lively and entertaining, however despite decent ratings, the program was still cancelled by ABC.  This is most unfortunate, as the series had the potential to run for several more years.",1384128000,,2872,5.391498881431767

2758061,5,B000N6UF10,"""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgarn!!!!!""  ""Sarge, don't ever do that again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""  Truer words were never spoken!
This 1965-67 comedy was the best ever made!  Starring great veteran actors like Forrest Tucker, Larry Storch, Ken Berry
and newcomer, Melody Patterson,  this show was the highest rated one on ABC for it's time spot and duration of the series. It also starred James Hampton, Bob Steele, Edward Everett Horton and many others.  Along with Tucker, Storch and Berry, we cannot forget Frank De Kova and Don Diamond as Chief Wild Eagle and Crazy Cat!
What made this series unforgettable was the acting, directing and especially the scripts.  I truly loved the pilot, ""SCOURGE
OF THE WEST"", ""THE GIRL FROM PHILADELPHIA""(First Season) and ""WRONGO STARR"", and ""MARRIAGE - FORT COURAGE STYLE""(Second Season) as examples of Season 2.  Many actors and comedians were dying to get on this show, some of them were Paul Lynde, Milton Beryle and Don Riclkes.  Pat Harrington, Jr, an unknown at the time, was truly great as a spy, Harrington was well known for a 1980's comedy series starring Bonnie Franklin.",1357948800,3,1106,5.174157303370786

The indians get much more time in season two and that is a good thing, very funny good actors.  Jane and the Capt's relationship gets a little tedious but you can bare with it.  I always wondered how the show ended and to solve that mystery I needed to buy season two, well spoiler, here it is the show  ends right on time.

2758163,4,B000N6UF10,"The original cast of regulars returns for the second and final season of the only reasonably successful Western sitcom.  Sgt. O'Rourke (Forrest Tucker) and Cpl. Agarn (Larry Storch) are still busily running O'Rourke Enterprises under the Army's radar; Capt. Parmenter (Ken Berry) is still conscientiously trying to run his fort according to the manual, and Wrangler Jane (Melody Patterson) is still trying to maneuver him into marriage; Chief Wild Eagle (Frank deKova) and his Hekawi Indians are still colluding with O'Rourke and Agarn; Pvt. Dobbs (James Hampton) is still blowing sour notes right and left, Pvt. Duffy (Bob Steele) is still retelling his exploits at the Alamo, and Pvt. Vanderbilt (Joe Brooks) is still not seeing what's in front of his nose.  Only this time, they're doing it all in color.  And a new wrinkle--and a new standing joke--is added in the person of Wild Eagle's ""Assistant Chief,"" Crazy Cat (Don Diamond), who dreams eagerly of the day when he can step into the boss's moccasins.

Intriguingly, there seems to be a trend toward the semi-serious, or at least the seriocomic, in this season.  In ""Reach for the Sky, Pardner,"" Agarn and O'Rourke try to trap the outlaws who made off with the fort's monthly payroll, and in ""Wilton the Kid"" Berry plays a dual role as Parmenter and his double, the bank-robbing Kid Vicious (no, he wasn't named after *Sid* Vicious, who hadn't yet begun his career at the time).  In ""The Ballot of Corporal Agarn,"" the corporal's absentee ballot will break the tie for Mayor of Passaic, and both the candidates descend on Fort Courage in an effort to capture it, while ""The Day They Shot Agarn"" finds our hapless two-striper facing the firing squad after a prisoner he was escorting escaped and may have killed O'Rourke.  In ""Guns, Guns, Who's Got the Guns?,"" Parmenter and his noncoms contend with an inspecting officer who claims someone on the Fort's roster is selling firearms to the Apaches.  ""The Majority of Wilton"" sees Capt. Parmenter resolved to study for the examination that may get him promoted to Major, but when he comes down with a cold all his friends (notwithstanding the fact that he's teetotal) ply him with alcohol-laced remedies--and when his Cavalry Manual is destroyed O'Rourke must turn tutor to drill him in the required subjects.  In ""Carpetbagging, Anyone?,"" a stranger comes to town and starts buying it up--along with everyone else within eyeshot--and Parmenter, Agarn, and O'Rourke join forces to try to drive him out.  In ""The Sergeant and the Kid,"" 10-year-old Joey Walker, whose father was a Cavalry trooper, wants to join up, much against the wishes of his widowed mother, and we're left with the impression that O'Rourke is smitten; in ""Is This Fort Really Necessary?,"" not only must Parmenter, O'Rourke, and Agarn contend with the possibility that their fort will be deactivated, but O'Rourke meets an old flame, and the attraction is still very much in force.  (Both these sgments showcase Tucker's versatility--he could do just as well at character drama as at comedy.)  And in ""Miss Parmenter,"" although it begins with the Captain's visiting spinster sister aggressively pursuing Pvt. Dobbs, things turn a bit grim when Wild Eagle comes down with appendicitis and O'Rourke--helped by Jane as his nurse and Miss P. reading aloud from a medical text--must turn surgeon to save his red partner.  All these episodes work as both humor and suspense, and it's a pity the series didn't last longer, because there might have been more of the same kind later on.",1301529600,3,3551,4.988155668358714

This was when sitcoms were funny, and not just amusing being passed off as funny as so many are today.
They suppose to be sitCOMs, not 'sitAMUSEments' (I know, the invented word is a stretch, but so are far too many of the 'sitcoms' today. THE BIG BANG THEORY is a really great exception- funny & well done! CHUCK is the only program I bother watching on the once-great NBC- its also a good program, maybe more of a dramedy. Excellent!

2758264,5,B000N6UF10,"There are positive messages in these fine shows underneath all the wonderful foolishness.

For one thing, the power of kindness. Everybody is kind to one another. Captain Parmenter is kind to all of his men, including the lowest ranks. He's kind to the town drunk and to the gunfighter who wants to kill him. He even tames the angry renegade Bald Eagle with kindness. In turn, O'Rourke, Agarn, and Dobbs are always kind to him (""Are you all right, sir?"") and his men watch out for him.

Parmenter is brave. He always leads the charge and faces every problem. He does his duty and pushes the others to do theirs. He tries to do the right thing. He keeps going, no matter what happens. And he *does* succeed in his job of keeping the peace in the area. (He just doesn't understand why.)

Wild Eagle doesn't kowtow to the white men. They come to him for help and advice. He keeps the pressure up on O'Rourke and outsmarts him regularly. The chief uses his intelligence, shrewdness, and drive for the good of the people he leads. He, too, is successful... his tribe is prosperous and at peace.

O'Rourke's crooked schemes fail, his noncom club warehouse regularly going up in flames. However, his kindly schemes succeed.

2758268,4,B000N6UF10,"""F Troop"" is a great series and represents simple uncomplicated fun. The quality of the video transfers in this package is excellent and the boxed set includes a brief retrospective documentary that fans should enjoy. The package thankfully only uses single sided DVD disks which I believe are less prone to scratching than double sided disks.

""F Troop"" series two shows how consistent the series quality was. There are only a few weak episodes in the whole bunch. Series Two is definitely zanier than series one featuring as it does German balloonists, the Hackowi's Hugh Hefneresque ""Playbrave Club"" and visits from Vincent Price in full Transylvanian garb and even a Beatles' like pop band ""the Bed Bugs"" (which actually featured Lowell George and Richie Hayward who would later form part of ""Little Feat""). Also Series Two gives greater screen time to supporting cast members like Duffy, Vanderbilt and Hannibal Dobbs.

To date no one has attempted a Hollywood revival of ""F Troop"" which is probably a good thing. Why bother with inferior substitutes when the real deal is available in such a fine package.",1197244800,4,1111,5.032608695652174

2758302,5,B000N6UF10,"We now come to the second and final season of F Troop.  All the usual suspects are back and in this set we are treated to color and a new opening theme.  Being in color gives the series a different feel; not better or worse, just different.  Also the beautiful Wrangler Jane (Melody Patterson) is now of legal age and her romantic advances towards Capt. Parmenter are more evident.

Every character makes me laugh, especially when ""Cowboy"" Bob Steele as Duffy starts reliving events at the Alamo.  Ken Berry provides physical comedy at Dick Van Dyke levels, Frank DeKova's wonderful send-up as Chief Wild Eagle, Forrest Tucker as Sgt. Morgan O'Rourke and best of all, Larry Storch as Cpl. Randolph Agarn.  His antics in calling the troops to attention, prompting them to laugh for the Captain, his indignant statements such as ""What about the Easter Bunny?"" and his funniest line in season two, ""Who says I'm dumb?""!  And of course don't forget the lesser known troopers: Gilbert & Sullivan, Stanley & Livingston and Lewis & Clark! :):):)

As said before, ""F Troop"" was far ahead of its time.  Both seasons provide clean, enjoyable humor for the entire family!

Mini update:  In Episode 19, ""The Sargeant and the Kid"", the young boy is portrayed by Peter Robbins, which of course is the 'original' voice of Charlie Brown.

I live in the UK and the TV stations here seem reluctant to show classic TV even with the advent of satellite/cable. I used to be very envious of American viewers who had access to TV Land, however I now see that they no longer show classic shows from the 60's preferring to now stick to shows from the 80's onwards.

I purchased Season 1 when it was released and laughed from start to finish, even my wife who never saw the original limited run of the show enjoys watching it and laughs just as much as myself.

8175202,4,B000N6UF10,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. They play fine.

The series is fun. I like the second season better than the first season because its in color, most of the old western series are black and white. Its as good as other comedies of its era like I Dream of Jeannie (1965-1970) or more recent comedies like The IT Crowd (2006-2013). But many of the older shows cant compete with the higher definition, special effects, and exotic locations of my favorite shows. There are exceptions, like Star Trek (1966-1969), which has been remastered. Those exceptions are rare.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

8175203,4,B000N6UF10,"The colors are very vivid.

Dual roles were over-done, in my view. Larry Storch played a Russian and a Quebecois fur trapper. Forrest Tucker played his character's father. Ken Berry played an outlaw. But that camera trick was an integral part of the 1960s -- from Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie, The Patty Duke Show and The Parent Trap to Elvis' Kissin' Cousins movie.

References to the 20th century abound -- from a drive-through horse-wash to a British Invasion-like singing group, The Bed Bugs.

The featurette on disc #6 is enjoyable. Given that Larry Storch did a commentary on The Phil Silvers Show 50th Anniversary DVD collection (and replicated on the series box set), I'm surprised that he did not make a contribution here.

The lack of episode commentaries is not a deal-breaker for me. The commentaries on The Dick Van Dyke series by Dick Van Dyke,. Rose Marie, Larry Matthews and Carl Reiner were great. In contrast, the commentaries on The Adventures of Superman and Monk were a snooze, ""I remember filming that"".
