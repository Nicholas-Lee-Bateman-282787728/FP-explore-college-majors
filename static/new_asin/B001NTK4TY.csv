8327926,1,B001NTK4TY,"I purchased this three DVD ""bundle"" directly from the author, Naomi Kakiuchi, on her website:  [...] There were excellent reviews of the DVDs. This rating is not about the content of the DVDs themselves. I bought them as a gift for a third party and have no idea yet what their impression is of the content of the DVDs.  My giving them just ""one star"" is because when I received the DVD ""bundle,"" the second and third DVDs were not in sealed packages. They appeared to have been used. The first DVD was in a sealed package. I bought these as a Christmas gift for someone and did not have time to try to find another set or ask Ms. Kakiuchi to replace them. However I did contact Ms. Kakicuchi about it and she alleges that the first DVD was produced by one company and she is now using another company to produce the 2nd and 3rd DVDs and they produce them ""to order"". As such, she alleges they do not seal the packages but she claimed they were new DVDs. I have purchased many DVDs over the years and I have NEVER seen one sold as NEW that was sold in an unsealed package. I advised Ms. Kakiuchi of this and questioned whether she would replace them with new sealed DVDs and she has never responded. I am disappointed to have paid full price for new items and two of the three items received appear to have been used. I only hope the person for whom I bought these finds them useful and has no problems with their quality and function.",1483056000,,1435,4.272058823529412
