8651566,5,B00BM2JVCI,"Bunohan gives insight to the reality of life within a culture of tradition and superstition. When three brothers all end up in Bunohan, the their different personalities show us the contrast between modernity and tradition. The film deals with issues of loyalty and revenge, as well as emotional memories from the past. This film is a beautiful portrayal of the daily life of the rural community with events that pull you in and keep you watching. The incredible cinematography emphasizes the reality of the characters and each situation they come across. I enjoyed watching this film a lot!",1367539200,,591,5.040816326530612
