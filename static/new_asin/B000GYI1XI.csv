The producers have tried to change the real history of the U-boat to make things more spectacular and very unfortunately are repeating themselves over and over again, as already mentioned in another review.
History made it's own history of this U-boat, which is not historical correct at all.",1285545600,2,390,4.735294117647059
8211995,2,B000GYI1XI,"I have watched this show twice. It is short,only about 55 minutes long,you can't see squat of the wreck due to the conditions of the water,it repeats it self several times at where the commercials would be inserted.

Eventhough the program is informative,I was very disappointed in the show.

I do not recommend this program!",1168473600,2,325,4.890909090909091
