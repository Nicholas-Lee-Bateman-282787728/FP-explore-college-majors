5681279,5,B00BXTH49M,"Doctor Who is an amazing show. Period. It'll be interesting to find out who Clara is and if she'll ""die"" again. The stories in Doctor Who are so unique and entertaining. It's not like American shows where there's a lot of sex, violence, drugs, etc. It's a good, clean show that always comes up with something new. Looking forward to the rest of the season. Bravo, Doctor Who.

P.S. Looking forward to the 50th anniversary episode later this year :)",1365120000,7,448,4.6

*Episode Reviews*

""The Bells Of Saint John"" Written by Steven Moffat (Doctor Who, Sherlock) and directed by Colm McCarthy (MI-5, Ripper Street) was a great episode. I really liked how the episode started with the Doctor as a monk in 1200 AD and Clara Oswald in the present and brought them together via the magic of the TARDIS. Steven Moffat's writing is always strong, and this episode is no exception. I really liked the reasoning behind making Clara the new companion which all gets tied in and clarified in the last few minutes of the episode, as well as who the baddie (as River Song would say ""Spoilers"") is of the episode, who was actually introduced in this last Christmas Special. The effects were great, the music was great, the location shooting looked great. This was a strong episode and I really like Jenna-Louise Coleman as Clara, I think she complements Matt Smith as the Doctor a lot better than Karen Gillan as Amy Pond did. I also really like the Doctor's motor cycle in this episode (you'll know what I am talking about when you see him ride it up the Shard) as well as the featured book written by Amelia Williams, a great nod to the last companion. I can't wait for the next episode ""The Rings Of Akhaten"".

""The Rings of Akhaten"" written by Neil Cross (MI-5, Luther) and direct by Farren Blackburn (The Fades, Luther) starts out with the Doctor watching Clara's parents meet for the first time and her growing up through life, to the death of Clara's mother in an attempt to learn more about her. Finally at the present, Clara agrees to go away with the Doctor on an adventure. She want's to go somewhere ""awesome"" so the Doctor takes her to the Rings of Akhaten, where they visit a city built into the asteroid belt of the planet. Upon their arrival we are greeted with a bevy of crazy and awesome looking aliens that rival the Cantina scene from Star Wars and the Troll Market in Hellboy 2: The Golden Army. Clara meets Merry, the Queen of years. She is running away from performing an important song to the 'Grandfather', a god (""more of an alarm clock really"") who sits in a pyramid in the asteroid belt. In a failed attempt to lull the mummified god back to sleep with her song, Merry is taken to the pyramid and is to be sacrificed to the god, as all the Queens of years are. I like that the Doctor's words of encouragement to Merry are very similar to what Clara's father told Clara's mother the night they first kissed. The masked beings (Vigils) looked cool and reminded me of a cross between the Silence and Cybermen. I liked this episode, it was very sci-fi, very otherworldly and the effects where great. Can't wait for next weeks episode ""Cold War"".

""Cold War"" written by Mark Gatiss (Mycroft Holmes in Sherlock, and long time writer of Doctor Who) and directed by Douglas Mackinnon (Robin Hood, Doctor Who) finds The Doctor and Clara on a return trip from Las Vegas ending up on board a Russian Nuclear Submarine circa 1983 in the North Pole. The Captain of the Sub (Liam Cunnigham of Clash of the Titans and Game of Thrones) holds the Doctor and Clara as prisoners after the Ice Warrior (not seen since the Third Doctor) that Professor Boffin (David Warner of Time Bandits and Titanic) brought on board and had thawed, thinking he had found a Mammoth. The Ice Warrior Grand Marshal Skaldak is captured and put in chains. Clara attempts to apologize to the Ice Warrior for its mistreatment but it's too little too late. The Ice Warrior escapes from its armor (apparently a huge dishonor for an Ice Warrior) and is running loose aboard the stranded sub. Thinking himself abandoned, Skaldak seeks to launch the subs nukes and destroy the Earth, via M.A.D. (mutually assured destruction). This episode was great. It felt like one of those great stand alone Doctor Who classic episodes. Mark Gatiss usually writes great episodes and this was no exception. I like that they use the TARDIS translation matrix to explain how the Doctor and Clara understand and speak Russian. And the TARDIS use of HADS (Hostile Action Displacement System). I also like the slight nods to the 1980's and not being bashed over the head with references. And I really like the Doctor not being quite used to Clara listening to his orders, clearly he is still used to Amy Pond who never quite seemed to do what he asked/told her to. This episode reminded me of Alien, and that is a great thing. Ice Warriors are awesome. Can't wait to see next weeks episode ""Hide"".

""Hide"" written by Neil Cross (Doctor Who episode ""The Rings of Akhaten, Luther) and directed by Jamie Payne (Primeval, The Hour) starts with a professor and his assistant conducting a test to talk to spirits in a house. Their tests yield results and the two encounter a ghost, and the Doctor and Clara. They are in the year 1974 and the Doctor claims the Ministry sent them to check on what Professor Palmer and his assistant Emma are up to. The Professor bought this house and is conducting tests to find the presence of the ghost. The ghost is screaming in all the photos they've taken of her, and the Professors assistant (a psychic) says the ghost is saying ""help me"". The Doctor dares Clara to go with him to find the ghost. The growing friendship between the two is great in this episode. The Doctor and Clara go to the music room, the heart of the house. There they find a cold spot and both feel like they're being watched. Meanwhile the professor's instruments pick up some serious readings. This episode has some great comical points and some great spooky points as well, a great blend of the two in the vein of the best classic films about haunted houses. The professor tells the Doctor that he searches for ghosts because he feels haunted after all the people he killed while in the service. Emma tells Clara not to trust the Doctor because ""there is a sliver of ice in his heart"". Clara still thinks the TARDIS doesn't like her, and the Doctor likens it to a cat. They take the TARDIS back in time, 6 billion years in the past, yet still in the same spot on the property of the haunted house. They travel again and watch the birth and death life cycle of Earth. Clara says she is a ghost, that everyone to the Doctor is a ghost because he can travel to any point in time, and in the future they're currently in, she's been long dead. To which he replies ""you're not a ghost, you're the only mystery worth solving."" They return back to 1974 and the Doctor says the Ghost may not be a ghost but a person trapped in a point where time moves slower. She is a time traveler and they all must help to free her. The Doctor harnesses up and jumps in through a wormhole so that he can grab the stranded time traveler and free her. Liked the Crooked Man a lot, very cool design. Another great episode. I think this 2nd part of series 7 is a lot stronger than the 1st part. Can't wait for next Saturday's episode ""Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS"".

""Journey To The Centre of The TARDIS"" written by Steve Thompson (Sherlock, and Doctor Who episode ""The Curse of The Black Spot"") and directed by Mat King (Law And Order: UK) opens with two brothers and an android on a salvage ship deep in space, very Heavy Metal 1980's sci-fi style, awesome, while the Doctor tries to talk to the TARDIS and convince Clara to help. Then they run into a problem. The salvage ship grabs them up and decides to crack open the TARDIS. But none of their tools will open it. The android can tell the TARDIS is in pain. The Doctor appears and realizes that Clara is trapped in side. In an attempt to get the crew to help him save Clara who is trapped inside the leaking TARDIS, the Doctor promises the crew the biggest salvage of their lives. Meanwhile Clara looks for the Doctor within the TARDIS, she opens a door that unleashes a wall of fire and finds herself in a labyrinth of corridors deep inside the TARDIS. The Doctor and the salvage crew enter the TARDIS and begin to look for Clara. The Doctor gives them an hour to help him find Clara against their will by setting the TARDIS to self destruct. Then changes it to half an hour in a very 11th Doctor kind of a way. Clara finds herself in a room full of artifacts and a strange creature. While being chased we get to see many awesome rooms, even the pool. The crew splits up to find Clara faster, one of the two brothers heads to the TARDIS control console to strip it for parts. We faintly here some of the TARDIS memoris, Amy and Rory and Clara's lines from past episodes can be heard. The other brother finds a room full of living metal, worth more than all the currency in the universe, a place where machines make machines. Which makes the TARDIS angry and it starts to throw a tantrum. Clara hides from the creature chasing her, in the TARDIS library. Clara ditches the creature and gets back to the control room, where the door has disappeared. The salvage crew and the Doctor run into two of the creatures that look just like the one that has been chasing Clara. The Doctor and the android find the echo room of the TARDIS which there are many of, used to keep the guests on board safe. Clara opens a door and the creature runs in while the Doctor can hear all this and he attempts to help her. Clara confronts the creature, the Doctor uses the sonic to help pull her though to the echo room. After the Doctor admits that the TARDIS self destruct is a ruse, they all realize that the engine is damaged and ""are all toast unless we do something"" so they take a detour to the center of the TARDIS. While running from exploding fuel cells, we find out a dark secret about the salvage crew. Turns out that the creatures chasing them all are parts of the future memory of the TARDIS memories leaking out. The Doctor confesses he brought Clara here to keep her safe because she died again when the dying star (used by Time Lord engineers for power) at the center of the TARDIS turns into a black hole. The Doctor asks Clara who she really is. He realizes she is no trick , she is real and just Clara, together they leap to the heart of the TARDIS. This episode is up there with ""Cold War"" for one of the best episodes of the seventh series, they used some great time rift stuff to tie everything together nicely. Next weeks episode ""The Crimson Horror"" looks awesome.

""The Crimson Horror"" written by Mark Gatiss (Sherlock, Doctor Who episode ""Cold War"") and directed by Saul Metzstein (Upstairs Downstairs, Doctor Who episode ""The Snowmen"") runs for 17 minutes before we even see the Doctor, but that's ok because we get to spend those 17 minutes with Vastra, Jenny and Strax (some of my favorite characters) as they try and figure out how bodies keep turning up dead in Victorian London with their skin bright red. Diana Rigg (The Avengers, Game Of Thrones) and her daughter Rachael Stirling (Salmon Fishing In The Yemen, Snow White and The Huntsman) are real life mother and daughter who play mother and daughter in this episode. Ada, the blind daughter of Winifred visits her monster in the tower (Who turns out to be someone rather important) while her mother and her minions are the ones behind capturing civilians and dipping them into vats of a red poison that will also end up being shot into the sky via rocket. This episode is a bit hard to review without giving away any spoilers. Jenny has an awesome action scene, Strax is as funny as ever, Clara is a bit under used but the last 2 minutes of the episode that focus on her back in her normal life are very important and game changing. The Doctor references his fifth incarnations companion, Tegan Jovanka which I thought was pretty cool. The episode looked great, the pacing was great, the effects were great. Mark Gatiss has written 2 of the best episodes yet for this half of series 7, very proper and classic episodes. After the last few minutes of this episode, I am anxious to see what happens next episode, which looks like it could be one of the best episodes this season, ""Nightmare In Silver"".

""Nightmare In Silver"" written by the legendary Neil Gaiman (Stardust, Coraline, the Doctor Who episode 'The Doctor's Wife' and not to mention all of his comics, Sandman being the most famous) and directed by Stephen Woolfenden (Second unit director on the last 4 Harry Potter movies and Warm Bodies) opens with the Doctor, Clara, Artie and Angie (The two kids who Clara baby sits and who have found out about her time traveling adventures in the last few minutes of last week's episode 'The Crimson Horror') arriving at Hedgewick's World Of Wonders amusement park. The park, once the best in all the universe, is not a rundown abandoned amusement park, pretty creepy really. There they meet Mr. Webley and his little collection of things, a few of which are fallen Cybermen from the Cyber Wars. Here they also meet Porridge (played wonderfully by the famous Warwick Davis) who is a chess master, among other things which I will not spoil. After the Cybermen come back via Cybermats, they ""upgrade"" into a newer, even more impressive Cyberman and pick up with the war where they left off. Meanwhile Angie and Artie have been kidnapped by the Cybermen and ""upgraded"" themselves, as well as the Doctor, whose mind is invaded by the ""Cyber Planner"" who makes a deal with the Doctor to play a game of Chess to win control over the Doctor's mind and learn all his secrets and memories, specifically about Time Lords. While Clara must lead a rag tag group of misfit soldiers to keep the Cybermen army from reaching the castle where they are all hold up within the park. I won't spoil anything about the ending, who wins the chess game and why, I'll just say it was brilliant as to be expected from Neil Gaiman. I felt once again, that Clara was underused, albeit this is probably all on purpose. I thought the scenes with Warwick Davis as Porridge were great, the effects and music were great as well. I can't wait for next episode and the last episode of this series ""The Name Of The Doctor"" who I think after the Christmas special and 50th anniversary special this year, will regenerate to the 12th doctor, this is just my feeling of course. If this does happen, I will miss Matt Smith as the Doctor. This second part of series 7 has been great, it's too bad there is only one episode left.

""The Name of The Doctor"" written by showrunner Steven Moffat and directed by Saul Metzstein (Upstairs Downstairs, The Musketeers) was an amazingly brilliant episode. I can't really say much about this episode without spoiling anything. We find out who/what/how Clara is, we also get to see what the Doctor's big secret is. Also, there is a huge guest star in the last five minutes of this episode. My head is just swimming after just having watched this and most of the episode was one big spoiler that I don't want to ruin for anyone who hasn't seen it, but it's safe to say this episode will please any Doctor Who fans (Whovians) and will be an instant classic. This was my favorite episode of all of series 7. I am pleased how series 7 ended and cannot wait for the 50th anniversary special. ""Doctor Who?""",1364601600,28,15662,4.514799154334038

Not only is the Christmas Episode missing, but the 50th Anniversary movie and the Final episode from Smith.  It's inadequate and totally incomplete.

5681314,5,B00BXTH49M,"This is the final season of Matt Smith, as the lovable, goofy, yet stern Doctor.  It didn't disappoint.  When show runner Steven Moffat took over writing/producing the long running sci-fi/fantasy show Doctor Who, he brought with him a slew of new ideas.  His writing is both praised and criticized.  Taking over at the same time Matt Smith stepped into the blue box, he started us on a twisting and turning ride.  Some episodes were better than others, and some have left us scratching our heads, but in the end he answers our questions.  Well, sorta.  He usually starts a whole new set of questions.

Matt Smith as the Doctor is one that has left Whovians across the globe split.  Fans of classic who were disappointed with the casting of a fresh faced, younger Doctor.  The so-called fan girls swooned over the actor.  I for one, who grew up watching Tom Baker's portrayal, loved Matt Smith as the Doctor.  In fact, I'm not sure that there has been an actor of Doctor Who that I don't like.  I do like some actors more than others, but overall I'm a big fan of all the actors.

The second half of series seven starts really with The Snowmen.  I won't go into great detail, but the show starts yet another group of questions, that get answered throughout the season, the 50th anniversary and the final episode of Matt Smith, The Time of the Doctor.

5681330,5,B00BXTH49M,"There are many great stories in this series. One of my favorite episodes is ""The Rings of Akhatan."" A brilliant powerful story written by Neil Cross. The script gives the fabulous actor, Matt Smith much to highlight his immense and diverse talent! I never tire of watching Matt's sensitive conversation with the `queen of days,' the little girl who has been raised for a particular, supposedly glorious task.

I also never tire of Matt's incredibly powerful, passionate performance talking to the parasitic God. This exquisite actor would never have been picked for a leading role in the too often, trite, one-dimensional American tv or movie making industry. He is too gangly, pale, does not have all the plastic facial features, capped teeth, nose job, to be chosen for a leading role, nor does he have the puffed up muscles physique. I am thrilled that BBC does not follow these plastic, empty-minded, one-dimensional standards. We all would have missed out on so many brilliant, powerful, passionate, fun, entertaining and multi-dimensional performances made available by Matt Smith's performance. It is clear in dramatic scenes he's not worried about mussing his hair or distorting his face if needed. His delivery is powerful, right on and awesome.

In this episode there is also the brilliant short story of, ""the most important leaf in history."" The main tale focuses on people's blind fear-based belief and actions in appeasing their `God.' It is brilliant and wise. As in many episodes in this series, beautiful music and lyrics are accompanied by great singers.

I am happy for Matt Smith choosing to leave the series and spread his acting wings, but incredibly sad he won't be portraying the doctor next year. His performances switched from deeply intense to humorous in a split second. He maintained high quality even when the story lines were weak, like the painfully annoying stories with the bratty girl Clara takes care of. No offense to preteen girls, but British and American tv too often portray these characters so stereotypically, or maybe based on the bratty preteen and/or teen girls the writers experienced in their lifetimes. Stunted stereotypes in writing are boring, period.

Anyone who likes stories well acted with story writing that may bring to light long held, unquestioned behaviors and beliefs, may enjoy this particular story, I sure did/do.",1380672000,,2377,5.134366925064599

Part two of Series Seven introduces us to a new companion that is fun, genuine and an interesting puzzle (everything Amy was not).  She is the impossible girl and watching the Doctor trying to figure out the mystery is great.  The second half of the series lacks a little with the stories,  I felt that most of the episodes weren't given real effort and some were just a mash up of previous episodes with a little twist.  My favorite episodes (reminded me of the David Tennant era) were Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS, The Crimson Horror and the Name of the Doctor.  Which were the last few episodes of Series Seven which makes me think they threw in filler episodes and put in effort towards the end.

This American DVD version does NOT have the Christmas Snowmen special, though, and it was actually very important so you MUST find it elsewhere and watch it FIRST!",1373241600,,349,4.898305084745763
5681373,3,B00BXTH49M,"After the departure of the Ponds in the first half of season 7, we meet the Doctor's new companion - Clara.  But we've already met her, twice before.  And she died both times.

Clara's mystery has an intriguing set up, but things soon settle down into routine Dr Who adventures, a trip to an alien world, stalking a monster on a Soviet sub in the 80s, hunting a ghost in the 70s, a trip through the Tardis, strange disappearances in Victorian England and a future amusement park.  Some good stories there but really they could have been told with any companion.  Clara's mystery really doesn't back up until the final episode where it's solved a bit too quickly.

Actress Jenna Coleman does a spectacular job as Clara, her previous appearances as a stranded starship crewman and a Victorian governess were quite good. But this version of her is yet another young British woman from the 21st Century and is much too close to Rose, Martha, Donna and Amy for my taste.  I would much rather have had her be a Victorian governess or a member of a futuristic space crew.  It's a sign of how uninteresting she is that whenever Vastra (the Victorian Samurai lizard woman seen last season) and her Paternoster Gang show up they easily steal the show from Clara.  Maybe with more time or if the series had focused on her mystery rather than settling too quickly into a routine it would not have bothered me as much.

The season has its high points however, besides the Paternoster Gang, Neil Gaiman's episode ""Nightmare in Silver"" is a lot of fun and Warwick Davis puts in the performance of a lifetime.  Heck why couldn't he be the companion?

The DVD set is also frustrating since it omits the Christmas special (the Snowmen) which is essential to set up the first episode.  It also leaves off on a cliffhanger for the 50th anniversary special.

Dr Who is starting to feel like a badly planned comic series where you can't expect that Season 7 will follow Season 6, no you have to track down webisodes, specials and other materials to follow the story.

5681387,3,B00BXTH49M,"When I first started watching the first season of Dr. Who starring Christopher Eccleston, I enjoyed it! It was fun and exciting and ingenious. However, the latest season is too dark and gloomy for my liking.

The Bells of St. John - Dr. Who displays 'righteous anger' many times whereas the villan seems to be more cool and composed! What happened to the fun loving Doctor?

The Rings of Akhaten - Again, the segment where the Doctor confronts the 'solar parasite' is too emotionally charged with anger. I felt it was more like watching Shakespeare than Dr. Who.

Cold War - Ok, not so much anger in this episode, but it was quite tedious to watch the Doctor trying to talk the Ice Warrior out of destroying earth. Not that I am looking for more action, but the whole dialogue was not convincing enough.

Hide - Perhaps one of the better episodes in this series. The fun-loving Doctor is back, and he travels to meet his 'idol' Emma Grayling. He then uses his TARDIS to help a stranded time traveller. That's the Doctor I used to love!

The Crimson Horror - Even the Doctor needs help sometimes! I think this episode demonstrates this beautifully.

Nightmare in Silver - Predictable storyline that you can see it coming from a mile away (when the Doctor suggested a chess match the intention was so obvious any fan would have picked it up). I felt the ending was a bit rushed.

The Name of the Doctor - How many girls need to disrupt the history of time in order to save the Doctor? Didn't Rose do that once by painting ""Bad Wolf"" all over time? The ending was both more depressing than it needs to be.",1371686400,2,1602,4.465753424657534

This last series seems more alive and fun than ever before! This is the promise of The Eleventh Hour finally delivered, there is a sense of adventure and wonderment  to the script, it's witty, fast paced and thrilling! Matt Smith really shines but so does Jenna Louise Coleman, the focus is back on adventure and discovery, this was the promise to Amy that degenerated into too much domesticity and bickering, to the point where I was wondering if I am watching Coupling in space?! Amy turned sour too quickly, from a curiosity driven companion to a winy wife. And the story of River Song became soo complicated, borderline ridiculous, seemed to be made up as they were taking us along for a roller coaster ride!
The chemistry between the actors wasn't thrilling either.
Now, Clara and the Doctor, that's chemistry!
The episodes have been described at length by other reviewers, what I wanted to say is Thank you Mr. Moffat for allowing the Doctor, The Tardis and Clara to be resplendent in them! The script is fantastic, I haven't had so much fun watching since discovering  Chris Eccleston! Yes, there is reverence for Doctor Who pasts, Red Dwarf, Alien, even Sunshine!
There is a lot of action, drama, mystery, but there is also a strong sci-fi component, more focus on time travel conundrums! Ingenious plot twists  and unexpected solutions! I thought I knew the Tardis by now, but Journey to the Center of the Tardis is an incredible whirlwind of surprise and delight! The Doctor is fierce, Smith shows a confidence and power that seemed undermined by the women before ( I really couldn't stand River Song mocking his driving skills!) Clara reminded me of Rose in the Parting of the Ways and Doctor 11 can stand up to the End of Time episodes,face off with the full dramatic power of Doctor 10 at his best!
I knew Mr. Moffat is brilliant and he can take the series to astounding new territories ! This is what I was waiting for when I heard he will take over from Russell T. Davies! These episodes exceeded my expectations! And I am confident we will be carrying on just fine with Doctor 12!
There is a wonderful tribute to Matt Smith in The Telegraph, Michael Hogan calls him ""a ball of eccentric energy ""! I loved that about him! He was the nutty professor that can turn on his heels and stand up to the Daleks ( The Pandorica Opens) , make some tough moral choices ( The Almost People), and even play some ball ( The Lodger). He was more playful and quircky than David Tennant's Doctor (a fez?!) but the way he would tilt his head and fire his gaze when the storm was brewing... And his childish excitement at a new gadget that he came up with, that is so fitting for an immortal young at 2 hearts alien!!!
Thank you Mr. Smith!",1370649600,,2817,4.487329434697855

5681404,5,B00BXTH49M,"I have watched Doctor Who since long before it's ""reboot"" in the mid 2000's.  David Tennant (10th Doctor) is right up there with Tom Baker who was my all time-favorite.  Matt Smith (11th Doctor) is now finally creeping up on my list of great doctors with this Season 7.2 run of 8 episodes with Jenna Louise-Coleman.  Although there might have been some other good storylines with the previous ""companion team"" I really didn't like the grouping or personalities as a whole.  I started off giving Matt Smith's doctor a solid try, but I quickly got sick of Miss Pond.  That in turn rubbed me the wrong way for Matt Smith's Doctor too.  I stopped watching them except for being pulled back every now and then.  Well, that is no longer the case.  7.2's run of 8 episodes is phenomenal, and I LOVED every storyline, twist and turn.  My husband and I both were staring at the screen at the end of the finale and going what the heck ... November 23rd??  {chuckles}  We were ready for more and loving every bit of it.  For those that have slammed there ""not being enough mystery"" or reveals ... I am wondering if they watched the same episodes that I did.  I thought they were some quality episodes with little twists and tidbits in each one.  So ... whether you are an old Doctor Who fan, or a new one ... you'll want to buy this Blu Ray or DVD for 7.2.  I have all of the 7.2 episodes from Amazon Video, and I am still going to buy a copy of this and the Christmas Special ""The Snowmen"".  I am honestly not waiting for a full Season 7 release because frankly, all I want is this ""second half"" which was 8 episodes while the ""first half"" with the rest of the last companion team was 5 episodes in 7.1.  With Jenna Louise-Coleman as Matt Smith's companion, I'm back in the Doctor Who fold full force.",1369872000,,1791,4.33033033033033
5681405,5,B00BXTH49M,"The legendary Doctor Who turns fifty-years-old this November and it is the time to catch up with the second half of series seven with the two-disc DVD of Doctor Who: Series Seven - Part Two out in stores today.

Picking up where the 2012 Christmas special, The Snowmen, ended, The Doctor tracks down the modern day version of Clara Oswin Oswald, aka The Impossible Girl, who just happens to need his help to stop the Great Intelligence. The Doctor is intrigue with Clara as she doesn't remember ever meeting him before. He takes her on a several adventures across the universe and across time in the TARDIS, but waiting in the shadows is the Doctor's darkest secret.

The episodes on the two-disc set are:

Disc One:

  The Bells of Saint John
  The Rings of Akhaten
  Cold War
  Hide

Disc Two:

  Journey to the Center of the TARDIS
  The Crimson Horror
  Nightmare in Silver
  The Name of the Doctor

Bonus Features are:

  The Bells of Saint John - A Prequel (2 minutes)
  Clarence and the Whisper men (2 minute prequel to Name of the Doctor)

I've heard many things about second half of series seven, especially about the cliffhanger finale that will lead into the 50th Anniversary Special set to air this November, so I was more than eager to watch Doctor Who: Series Seven - Part Two, which I received a complimentary copy from BBC Home Entertainment in exchange for my honest thoughts. I thought Part One was slightly disappointing as a swan song for the former companions Amy and Rory, but I was impressed with the cinematic feel of ""The Snowmen"" Christmas special.

The main plot for the Part Two's eight episodes is about the Doctor trying to figure out who Clara, whom he has seen die twice, really is. Of course everything leads to a show down with the Great Intelligence and the unveiling of the Doctor's secret, which is all over the internet, but I decided not to reveal it to others who haven't seen the episode yet. There are many well-written stand-alone episodes. I especially enjoyed the episode ""Hide"" guest-starring Jessica Raine (Call the Midwife) and Dougray Scott as the plot involves some paranormal activity. ""Cold War"" brings back an almost forgotten enemy, an Ice Warrior, but with updated special effects. And of course the Cybermen return in ""Nightmare in Silver"" written by Neil Gaiman and guest-starring Warwick Davis.

Overall, I think the Doctor Who: Series Seven - Part Two has some of the best written episodes from the new incarnation. Jenna-Louise Coleman as Clara is a perfect fit for 11th Doctor's Matt Smith. I even liked the finale's cliffhanger twist. I recommend the DVD or Blu-ray to old or new Doctor Who fans.",1369699200,,2658,4.737991266375546
5681406,2,B00BXTH49M,"This video is for the die hard Doctor Who fans who believe, no matter what, the franchise can do no wrong.  I'm a Doctor Who fan myself, however, this series was just o.k.

Not only is he humorous as Sherlock's brother but as a writer he is outstanding! Not only does he write great stuff for Sherlock, but he did not hold back his best from this episode of Doctor Who. He is so comfortable writing for the characters that it almost appears to be effortless. Everything jelled in this episode. Nothing the characters did was out of, well, character. Don't stop watching. If this is going to keep up it will be the end of a great season.",1367625600,,623,4.426086956521739
5681408,5,B00BXTH49M,"""The Snowmen"", the 2012 Christmas special, and it's Prequels, will not be part of the May 2013 release of Series 7 - Part 2. ""The Snowmen"" MAY be part of the Complete Season 7 DVD/Blu-Ray release, but BBC has not said so yet.
(You can purchase ""The Snowmen"" by itself for region 1, on DVD and Blu-Ray.)
[Added later:  ""The Snowmen"" IS included in the Complete Season 7, including a brand new commentary track with commentators Michael Pickwoad (production designer) and Paul Spriggs (art director).]

The 8 episodes are only 45 minutes each. Though I love Doctor Who, I think the shorter time-frame does hobble the story-telling. Lots of detail crammed into a short time.

Wouldn't it be great if some of the new series had a commentary track like the Classic Doctor Who DVD's? Here are the Extras on the DVD and Blu-Ray issues of series 7 - Part 2:

1. Prequel to ""The Bells of St. John"" (2 min) The Doctor glumly sits on a swingset in a park. A young girl joins him, noticing that he's sad. He tells her he's lost something: ""The first two times I met her, I just sort of bumped into her. So I thought, maybe, if I just wandered about a bit I might bump into her again. You know, like, destiny."" Who is this understanding little girl?
2. ""Clarence and the Whispermen"" (2.5 minutes) Prequel to ""The Name of the Doctor"". Clarence is in prison, set to be hanged on the morrow. He opens his eyes and three ghastly creatures in top hats are watching him. ""I know you're not real,"" Clarence cries, ""You're just voices inside my head. Leave me alonge!""  But they don't.
3.  English Subtitles

EPISODE 7.6 - ""The Bells of St. John""
Part 2 of Season 7 has an ongoing quest - the Doctor's search for the why and how of Clara Oswin Oswald. As the Doctor mutters in episode 7.7, ""She's just a girl. How can she be? She can't be. She is! She can't be. She's not POSSIBLE."" Does the TARDIS really not like Clara?

In this episode, Clara and the Doctor meet again in present day London. Not that Clara recognizes the Doctor, or trusts him - after all, he's inviting her into his snog box where the inside is bigger than the outside.

And that's after the Doctor rescues her from being uploaded to a data cloud by a walking wi-fi station ""hoovering up people"". A temporary rescue, as it happens. As the head hooverer tells the Doctor: ""My Client requires a steady diet of living human minds. Healthy free-range human minds. He loves and cares for humanity.... The farmer tends his flock like a loving parent.... No one likes cattle like Burger King.""

EPISODE 7.7 - ""The Rings of Akhaten""
Clara asks the Doctor to take her somewhere and sometime spectacular. He complies with a visit to ""the Pyramid of the Rings of Akhaten."" They're just in time for the Festival of Offerings, held every 1,000 years when the rings align.

Clara gets to see aliens aplenty. And she befriends the Queen of Years, a young girl taught the song to wake up the god. But when it turns out that one of the Queen's duties is to be a sacrifice, the Doctor and Clara step in.

I love the idea of the currency on this system. They don't use money, as the Doctor explains to Clara, but trade in items of ""sentimental value.... Psychometry. Objects physically imprinted with their history. The more treasured they are, the more value they hold.""

EPISODE 7.6 - ""Cold War""
After saving Akhaten, the Doctor and Clara are going to have some fun. The Doctor exits the TARDIS first, macho shades in place and crying out, ""Viva Las Vegas...!"" But instead of sunshine in the desert playland, they're immediately drenched and tossed about in a leaking submarine.
Clara: ""Not Vegas then?""
Doctor: ""No, this is much better.""
Clara: ""A sinking submarine?""
Doctor: ""A sinking SOVIET submarine.""

It's 1983, the height of the Cold War. Captain Zhukov prepares a test launch of the submarine's nuclear missiles. But he has two problems, the first being the Doctor and Clara's suspicious appearance. Part of his mission is bringing home Professor Grisenko and his chunk of 5,000 year-old ice containing ... what? They soon find out, because a crewman, against orders, applies a blowtorch to the ice, grinning, ""Life's too short to wait."" Life's too short, period. A metal arm cracks through the ice and grabs him by the throat.

That's the 2nd problem. A submarine's too small for everyone not to meet, and the Doctor is flabbergasted. ""It's an Ice Warrior. A native of the planet Mars. And we go way back. Waaay back.""

Oh boy, the Ice Warrior race abandoned Mars centuries ago. The Doctor might have been able to offer the Warrior a ride to their new home, but the TARDIS has disappeared. He might have been able to negotiate working together, but a Russian crewman stuns the Warrior and he wakes up in chains, an act of war. What's a soldier to do? Especially one who thinks he's been abandoned for 5,000 years.

EPISODE 7.9 - ""Hide""
Major Alec Palmer, retired, has ghosthunting equipment set up in an elegant house. He and Emma Grayling, an empathetic pyschic, begin, as he puts on headphones and speaks into a microphone: ""Caliburn House, Night 4, November 25th, 1974, 11:04 pm."" Emma walks towards the dark hallway, saying softly, ""I'm speaking to the lost souls that abides in this place. Come to me.""

The Major's instruments start going wild. Then they're startled by loud knocks on the big wooden doors. The Major opens the door. ""Bob! Hello! I'm looking for a ghost!"" It's the Doctor and Clara, and they've come here on purpose (for once). What is the scary emanation they see, crying, ""Help me!""

At one point, the Doctor says, ""We need some sturdy rope, plus a blue crystal from Metebilis Three."" We know when he got that - in a funny sequence in ""The Green Death"" with Jon Pertwee!

EPISODE 7.10 - ""Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS""
The Van Baalen brothers run a salvage operation. Their giant ship uses a Magno-Grab, ""outlawed in most galaxies"", according to the Doctor, to pull in the TARDIS. The Doctor makes it out, but the TARDIS is leaking poisonous fuel and Clara is stuck inside. The Doctor bribes the brothers to help him rescue Clara. They'll get the TARDIS, ""the salvage of a lifetime"", if they get her out.

The rescue part isn't going well, and one brother asks the Doctor, ""So you're telling us we're safe?""
Doctor: ""Safe - ish. Apart from the monsters and the TARDIS reinventing the architecture every five minutes."" Monsters as in molten creatures with red fissures like flowing lava and a deep rolling growl that terrifies.

EPISODE 7.11 - ""The Crimson Horror""
It's 1893 and the Paternoster Gang (see ""The Snowmen"" Christmas special) is hired to find out why Edmund Thursday, newspaper reporter, went to the Sweetville factory town in Yorkshire, and came out dead, his skin hardened and turned a brilliant waxy red.

His brother asks Madame Vastra: ""Do you know what an optogram is?""
She smiles, ""It's silly superstition, Sir. The belief that the eye can retain an image of the last thing it sees.""
He pulls out a photo of Edmund's eyeball, and the last thing the dead man saw - was the Doctor!

Jenny goes undercover, attending a rousing recruitment speech by Winifred Gillyflower, the owner of Sweetville. Sweetville, she declares, the ""shining city on the hill"", is the place to be when the Apocalypse ""rains down upon us all."" Just who is going to bring the end of the world?  What kind of rain are we talking about? Who is Gillyflower's silent partner. And does the Doctor need rescuing?

""I'm the Doctor. You're nuts. And I'm going to stop you.""

EPISODE 7.12 - ""Nightmare in Silver""
A special treat! The Doctor takes Clara and her two charges, Angie and Artie, to Hedgwick's World of Wonders, a whole planet turned amusement park. Well, it would have been a treat, except when they get there the park is in ruins, guarded by a troop of reject soldiers. Their Captain tells them, ""This planet is closed by Imperial Order.""

But fun can still be found. They meet Webley, a traveling carney, and his ship of ""Webley's World of Wonders"". Webley goes into Impresario mode: ""Let me demonstrate to you the wonder of the age, the miracle of modernity. We defeated them all 1,000 years ago. But now, he's back to destroy you .... at chess.""

Yow! It gives the Doctor a scare, but, whew, it's an empty Cybershell chess-playing machine. But wait a minute. What are those electronic silverfish climbing the walls. As the VERY impressed Doctor says when he catches one, not a Cybermat, but a Cybermite. But where there's Cybermites, there must be Cybermen. This does not look good.

This episode is fun, but it could have been GREAT in a longer time frame. More time to explore Angie's refusal to let the Doctor impress her (teenagers!). Expansion of the personalities of a couple reject soldiers. The hyper-patriotism of the Captain played off against her admitted insubordination - which lead to her posting to this backwater. And don't upgrade the Cybermen willy-nilly; make it an integral part of the plot.

But, on the plus side, Matt Smith does a terrific job of playing a split personality Doctor.
""Hail to you, the Doctor. Savior of the Cybermen!"" Say what?

EPISODE 7.13 - ""The Name of the Doctor""
The prologue is Clara's narration accompanying a montage of Clara seeing Dr. Who through the ages and his regenerations. It ends with ""I blew into this world on a leaf. I'm still blowing. I don't think I'll ever land. I'm Clara Oswald. I'm the Impossible Girl. I was born to save the Doctor.""

The Great Intelligence kidnaps Vastra, Strax and Jenny to force the Doctor to open his tomb on Trenzalore. The  purpose of THAT I won't give away as it's a major plot point, but I will say that G.I.'s frame of mind does not make sense.

This episode supposedly ""revealed the mystery of Clara Oswald"". I watched it twice, and all I've got are more questions, starting with: Where did the leaf come from?

Strax has a hilarious scene in the beginning, and every scene with River Song is a marvel.

As the VERY impressed Doctor says when he catches one, not a Cybermat, but a Cybermite. But where there's Cybermites, there must be Cybermen. This does not look good.

This episode is fun, but it could have been GREAT in a longer time frame. More time to explore Angie's refusal to let the Doctor impress her (teenagers!). Expansion of the personalities of a couple reject soldiers. The hyper-patriotism of the Captain played off against her admitted insubordination - which lead to her posting to this backwater. And don't upgrade the Cybermen willy-nilly; make it an integral part of the plot.

But, on the plus side, Matt Smith does a terrific job of playing a split personality Doctor.
""Hail to you, the Doctor. Savior of the Cybermen!""
Say what?

EPISODE 7.13  -  ""The Name of the Doctor""
The prologue is Clara's narration accompanying a montage of Clara seeing Dr. Who through the ages and his regenerations. It ends with ""I blew into this world on a leaf. I'm still blowing. I don't think I'll ever land. I'm Clara Oswald. I'm the Impossible Girl. I was born to save the Doctor.""

The Great Intelligence kidnaps Vastra, Strax and Jenny to force the Doctor to open his tomb on Trenzalore. The purpose of THAT I won't give away as it's a major plot point, but I will say that G.I.'s frame of mind does not make sense.

This episode supposedly ""revealed the mystery of Clara Oswald"". I watched it twice, and all I've got are more questions, starting with: Where did the leaf come from?

Strax has a hilarious scene in the beginning, and every scene with River Song is a marvel.

I am hoping there will be 'special features' on these disks because I would really like to see some of the prep for the ending scene of ""The Rings of Akhaten"".  Not going to say anymore about that. Oh, well, just say it's fantastic.
I've been watching DW since the 4th season of the Classic Series. (yes, I'm that old).  I became aware of the William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, and Jon Pertwee 'Doctors' and watched them.  Jon Pertwee became my favorite.  Since then, no one has held a candle to him until now.  Who would have thunk that an upstart 26 year old could play a 907 year old Time Lord, but I saw it at the end of the most recent Christmas special, and then in 'The Bells of St. John'.  Jon Pertwee will always be my favorite from the classic series, but Matt Smith has become, as River Song puts it 'my' Doctor of the new series.",1366588800,3,931,4.167597765363128

8575189,5,B00BXTH49M,"this part of the series gets a lot of hate, but overall, the stories are actually very good to me.  series 7 is not the best series, but I still think series 7b actually is a little underrated. I wish the snowmen was put into it, bc it's vital to Clara's journey, but hey, what can u do?

my favs are the Bells of Saint John, rings of Ahkaten, Hide, Journey to the Center of the TARDIS, Crimson Horror, and the name of the doctor. personally, I don't see why these episodes are terrible.  I actually like how they are.  also, i'm in the minority, I admit.  I like 11 and Clara together.  they were fun to watch to me.  people always want the companions, for some reason, to enter and have a lot of drama in their lives.  that's what they consider 'deep'.  they also seem to want the stories to revolve around them. I was fine with a companion where the stories were mostly just about the doctor and companion on an adventure with no real drama in the background/annoying love triangles/doctor being a dick to his companion bc he misses his previous companion.  personally, I was fine with them. but that's just me",1502668800,,1113,4.359223300970874

As for episode quality, I'm not going to lie, the episodes aren't the best. Unlike past seasons of Doctor Who, season 7 didn't have much of a story arc. Part 1 simply lead up to the Pond's leaving, and Part 2 is basically random adventures with Clara until the last one, which springs your right into the 50th anniversary. It's definitely different than other seasons.",1471392000,,490,4.50561797752809
