8076590,2,B000AA4F7Y,In Full Metal Yakuza a super wimp Yakuza (whose gringing and weeping got on my nerves) is shot by rival gang members and rebuilt as super Yakuza who sets out for revenge. Here is where you are waiting for Takashi Miike's over the top violence to come in but .....you are sorely disappointed. Super Yakuza is more bad comedy than good and gore hounds will be left hanging as our hero eats nuts and bolts for breakfast and admires his hefty rebuilt manhood. Entertaining in parts but not the Takashi that I was hoping for.,1168473600,3,520,4.484210526315789
