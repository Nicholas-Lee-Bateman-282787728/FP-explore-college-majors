Not a lot of fun for the kids to dance to because there actually aren't any children dancing on the DVD, unlike the other 5 star review posted. So after a couple of songs my kids got bored of it. It kind of started with a bang that led to a fizzle. My kids are 5 and 3.",1447977600,,388,3.802469135802469

8117599,5,B000F5DRCI,"This is our 2 yr old sons favorite out of all the Shout Praise DVD's, although he likes them all.

Great graphics and words on the screen. Keeps our son occupied while we take a break!

Highly Recommended.",1252454400,2,205,4.368421052631579
8117600,5,B000F5DRCI,"MY KIDS LOVE THIS AND IT IS GREAT!  THEY DANCE, WORSHIP AND SING RIGHT ALONG WITH THE OTHER KIDS ON THE DVD.  THERE ARE WORDS ON THE SCREEN FOR THEM.  I LOVE THIS, TOO AND LOVED DANCING AND SINGING RIGHT ALONG WITH THEM.

YOU WILL ENJOY THIS!",1216166400,3,242,4.085106382978723
