4134172,5,B003KVMULI,"My fear for some time is that the healthcare industry has been behaving like a spinning top that has lost its center and is beginning to wobble and dip and will soon fly of the table.  So, to see a film that captures this situation so effectively is both refreshing and frightening.  There is no one in this country who would not benefit from seeing this film because it really shows what the state of healthcare is from the captains point of view, and the reality is if the captains are jumping ship, the ship is sinking.",1274832000,2,522,4.371134020618556
4134173,5,B003KVMULI,"Thankyou for making an excellent documentary film about health care delivery challenges from the Physician's perspective. The pillars of our health care system, the Doctors, have been consistently left out of policy and planning for health care delivery and the results are identified in this film.  Doctors are now commonly asked to forsake their professional integrity with bureaucratic mandates focusing on paper pushing prior approvals and all manner of regulations.  Given this atmosphere, which discourages appropriate care and adequate interaction with patients, it is no wonder that many are abandoning their hard earned  profession in order to maintain their ethical and professional integrity.  Now we face a huge shortage of Physicians in this country.  Our health care crisis can only be resolved when Physicians are front and center with identifying and implementing the solutions.  Toward that end, this is a film that should be seen by everyone - because we all need health care - and our Physicians are on the front lines - and we need to keep them there.",1274572800,6,1071,5.233918128654971
4134174,5,B003KVMULI,"I remember being pregnant for the first time and having a DR tell me that she only had exactly 8 minutes to talk to me. At the time I was horrified. I still don't think it was a great way to greet a new patient...but, after watching this movie and the ridiculous amount of hoops a DR has to jump through to try and provide actual care, I now have great compassion.  Malpractice and insurance companies are the elephant in the room.  This film made me feel like medical care took a drastic, drastic turn once lawyers intervened and saw that they could make a dollar off of people believing they have been wronged and mistreated. This has created an environment that has led to an unnecessary paper trail, a decrease in work ethic due to 40% of the job becoming chart coding, paperwork, forms to have patients fill out, etc. Dr's can no longer do their job and I partly feel that lawyers and the insurance companies and the CYA approach is what would cause a DR to walk in and tell me--""I only have 8 minutes."" I worry for the future of my daughter and I worry with the new demands on healthcare that if we will be down 250,000 clinicians in the somewhat near future..what are we going to do? really! This is a raw reality and it's the underground murmur in the healthcare industry that DR's are leaving in droves and after watching this...I don't blame them.",1273795200,7,1357,4.402390438247012
4134175,5,B003KVMULI,"As an internal medicine physician who has practiced for over twenty years, I have contemplated leaving many times.  This excellent 70 minute documentary film captures in a riveting way the root problems of our health care crisis.  Through the delicate and perceptive view of a camera lens, Ryan and Nancy, carefully dissect the root problems: Physician burnout and patient dissatisfaction.  As they open the soul of medicine, it becomes quite clear to the viewer that increasing bureaucratic interference, the daunting pressure of malpractice litigation and the unrealistic expectations of the American public for physician perfection has created this dis-ease of an ancient profession.  Left unchecked and unopposed, these issues have destroyed the sanctity and sacredness of the physician- patient relationship. Through poignant interviews with physicians we can palpate the pulse of their anguish and discontent. At many times their candid discussions brought this reviewer to tears. The documentary also exposes the nerve of patient expectations through many candid impromptu interviews on the street.  It becomes obvious that the current health care system sets them up for disappointment - unrealistic expectations for perfection in the physician but no counterpart accountability for patients as to their own health outcomes.  The documentary leaves many open-ended questions, which those of us in the medical profession know is the best method for conducting an interview.  We are at a tipping point in the future of the American health care system. I humbly believe that this film gracefully and skillfully allows us to pause and reflect before we proceed mindlessly into further solutions that will kill our profession.
If you love yourself, your family, the sanctity of medicine and ultimately the future of health care in this nation,  Please watch this movie and  get involved!  If we don't act now, Who will Take the Oath?",1273104000,7,1936,5.444816053511706
4134176,5,B003KVMULI,"Powerful, poignant, and based in reality, this film is a sobering view of the burnout of doctors and our current health delivery system. The creators are believers in health care but fearful of our future here in the US with the various forces at work in the business of medicine that are detrimental to the care of patients, and also to the health of the caregivers. Kudos to those brave enough to bring this subject to light. The film was the opening piece at the Osler Symposium in Albuquerque last week. It should be included in many more public forums with both medical professionals and patients alike.  It should be ""required viewing"" for policymakers. In the remake of our healthcare we need to maximize benefit to the patients and minimize the squeeze on the doctors and nurses, or the burnout will leave us with few to heal the future sick.",1306281600,,850,4.666666666666667
4134177,5,B003KVMULI,"Bravo. I recommend this for premed and med students, and anyone else in medicine who may feel alone and desperate in today's healthcare soup. Dr. Flesher is clearly a good doctor caught in the American medical grinder. Also potentially eye opening for anyone considering a trip to the ER.",1306281600,,288,4.8979591836734695
4134178,5,B003KVMULI,"highly recommended for anyone that is going into medicine, or thinking about it.  it tells it as is.  good for someone to understand from the doctors point of view and difficulties.  recommended it for med students.  tells it like it is.",1294012800,,237,4.7073170731707314
4134179,5,B003KVMULI,"In ""The Vanishing Oath"" Ryan Flesher, MD, bravely invites us along with him as he struggles to overcome feelings of burnout and disappointment in a profession that has required years of sacrifice. Along his path, he finds other physicians - even quite early on in their careers - with similar frustrations and disappointments. He touches on the factors that have contributed to physician burnout, as well as public perception of physicians. The movie presents statistics and projections that paint a somber portrait of the future of medicine for physicians. Despite the high stakes and expectations that come along with being an ER doctor, Flesher exposes the very human side of being a physician practicing medicine today.

""The Vanishing Oath"" is a movie that should be seen by anyone who interacts with physicians. Based on our hopes for health care reform, this would be everyone in this country in the future. But any health care reform movement would be remiss if it did not take into account what is going on in the minds and hearts of these individuals on the front line. Bureaucracy and the ""business of medicine"" have resulted in a silent departure of physicians from clinical work.

Despite its overall solemn tone, and lack of real solutions (which mirrors the reality that Flesher is presenting), this movie is inspiring because it is a timely starting point for open dialogue about this heretofore quiet movement. Because the quality of healthcare is only as good as its providers, we need to find ways to prevent an exodus.",1289952000,,1538,4.980544747081712
4134180,4,B003KVMULI,"This video exposes some of the frustrations and roadblocks to the practice of medicine.  Many of the changes in medicine have led from the focus on a doctor-patient relationship, to a business model with providers and consumers.  The patients and doctors are now dominated by outside forces, whose focus is on profit.  This film shows the effects of assembly line medicine and further dehumanizing that accompanies this.

Although the protagonist is an emergency department doctor the barriers to effective and satisfying care are seen in most fields of medicine.",1282003200,2,563,5.292134831460674
4134181,5,B003KVMULI,"I thought this film was very well done. It especially did a good job of showing how dehumanized American medicine has become for all parties--the practitioners are burning out from over-long hours, insane ""requirements"" of various middle men (insurance companies and the like), plus unrealistic expectations that they be omniscient and omnipotent in their work. Meanwhile, the patients rightly feel that they are being treated as objects by physicians who are volume-overloaded and too multi-tasked to be able to give their full attention.

We are all in this together and we are all human. The physicians are not gods and we need to stop divinizing them. At the same time, we should all give a thought as to how medicine can be humanized for all involved, because it is just too important to let it go.",1280880000,,803,4.904411764705882
4134182,5,B003KVMULI,"I heard of this independent film from another physician who has been practicing for over 20 years.  This physician left his private internal medicine/geriatrics practice 3 years ago for exactly the reasons outlined in this film.  I myself have been out of residency and practicing as a hospitalist physician for just 2 years, and unfortunately, already know all too well the frustrations Dr. Flesher portrays.

 My career in medicine is not what I envisioned it being when I made my first steps, full of pride and anticipation, into medical school.  You imagine the endpoint of years of schooling and training to be one in which at the end of the day you feel honored to be taking care of people and can perhaps see tangible proof that what you did during the day put more good into the world, or at least took a little of the bad out of it.  Instead, I find myself absolutely exhausted, spending most of the day not with patients, but with mounds of paperwork (documenting ""correctly"" an interaction with a patient in the medical record has become much more important than the actual encounter with the patient him/herself), navigating through the obstacles that prevent a doctor from delivering good patient care (insurance company rules, medicare rules,  figuring out how an under- or un-insured patient you have made well in the hospital is going to continue on that trajectory once discharged if they cannot afford the necessary medications to achieve that end).  There are the case managers telling you that a nursing home will not accept a patient who to any logical person, belongs in one, because they have not yet been in the hospital as an inpatient for 72 hours.  There are utilization review personnel telling you that a patient who legitimately belongs in the hospital does not meet ""inpatient"" or even ""observation"" criteria for being in the hospital based on arbitrary guidelines written by people who have never placed a stethoscope on someone's chest.

In addition, the culture of malpractice litigation has created an environment of mistrust both on the patient's and the physician's side.  The patient almost looks at a physician as a used-car salesman, not fully divulging all the important information or pretending like he/she knows what their talking about when they don't.  The physician likewise looks at a patient not as a person with an illness that he/she might be able to alleviate, but as a potential plaintiff.  Dr. Flesher mentions how so many unnecessary tests are ordered by doctors so that they don't miss anything just in an effort to avoid being sued.

One thing not mentioned in the film is the culture of a hospital being a business, with the new thinking of patients as customers.  The new metric by which our ""service"" is being measured is ""customer satisfaction.""  To this end, I think it is interesting how Press Ganey refused to be interviewed by Dr. Flesher.

Overall, I highly recommend this excellent film.",1279152000,3,2954,4.923387096774194
4134183,4,B003KVMULI,"This is a documentary film directed (and acted) by a young emergency room physician, Ryan Flesher, MD and produced by a former clinical social worker, Nancy Pando, LICSW entitled ""The Vanishing Oath.""

As background, the film was a three-year project born in 2007 just before the great US health care reform debate began. Over 200 hours of interviews were conducted explore a simple question: why Dr. Flesher had grown to hate medicine.

It would have been easy for Dr. Flesher and Ms. Pando to make his story nothing but a rant, but instead, I found that their story was an honest attempt to understand how someone so enthusiastic at the start of their training could become so quickly discontented with the realities of emergency room care and our bloated health care delivery system.

To understand the origin of his disillusionment, the film journeys with Dr. Flesher and Ms. Pando as they return to interview people on the street, his family, fellow medical students, mentors, scholars, colleagues, plantiff's attorneys and Yesterday, a much-anticipated package arrived in the mail containing a documentary film directed (and acted) by a young emergency room physician, Ryan Flesher, MD and produced by a former clinical social worker, Nancy Pando, LICSW entitled ""The Vanishing Oath.""

To understand the origin of his disillusionment, we journey with Dr. Flesher and Ms. Pando as they return to interview people on the street, his family, fellow medical students, mentors, scholars, colleagues, pliantiff's attorneys, and theologians.  They attempt to interview many of the many ""vested interests"" involved in our current health care system, including:

  American Medical Association
  Many insurers, including Blue Cross, Aetna, Cigna
  Three congressman
  Six state representatives
  Many hospital administrators and 11 Boston-area hospital CEO's
  The Joint Commission
  Dr. Groopman, author of ""How Doctors Think,""
  Ewe Reinhardt, medical economist
  Regina Herzlinger, Author of ""Who Killed Healthcare""
  Press Ganey and
  Five CEO's of major drug manufacturers.

...but of those that responded to their requests for an interview, all wanted to see the questions beforehand. Ultimately, none of them opted to go on record in the making of this film.

The viewer is left to wonder why.

Still, they manage to gather a few insightful interviews from those with health care administrative backgrounds. More importantly, we quickly realize that Dr. Flesher is not alone. The same forces that shaped his discontent are revealed in fourth year medical students unsure what lies ahead for them and in the colleagues he turned to during fellowship training. We are introduced to a young aspiring hand surgeon who left medicine after all of his years of training because of the toll it took on himself and his family. The footage is powerful. The people and emotions, real.

Suddenly, the viewer is confronted with the reality of how our health care system has grown to affect doctors. Worse, we realize what this might mean to each of us.

Additionally we see, firsthand, the effects that the fear of malpractice has on doctors and their behaviors. More to the point, we hear from several doctors who had been sued and are even ushered into the office of an anonymous doctor in the midst of a suit at the time. Only later, and contained in a separate clip contained on the film's DVD, do we learn that the anonymous doctor interviewed was doctor Robert P. Lindeman, MD, the no-longer anonymous physician blogger former known as ""Flea"" as he was being tried in court just before he was unmasked on the stand by the prosecuting attorney. (A remarkably insightful follow-up interview with Dr. Lindeman a year and a half after his trial was settled is included on the film's DVD and is especially humbling. For instance, in the follow-up interview we learn that his medical malpractice rates increased 40% for the ""settlement."")

In the end, we aren't quite sure if Dr. Flesher decides to return to medicine or not. You'll have to see the film to draw your own conclusion.

At times I felt the film leaned too heavily on the question of why doctors are unhappy at the expense of other critical health care issues. After all, not everything in medicine hinges upon whether doctors are unhappy or not, and that question is probably the least important to the public at large. It would have been nice to see input from a few more doctors satisfied with their profession.  Still, the issues of physician burnout and attrition, coupled with our ever-burgeoning health care bureaucracy and the loss of physician autonomy, will no doubt continue to affect the recruitment of future generations of physicians and perhaps the caliber of doctors in the future.

Nonetheless, both Dr. Flesher and Ms. Pando are to be congratulated for their bravery and fortitude at completing this documentary. It's a raw, heartfelt, unapologetic look behind the curtain of our current health care system from a physician's point of view.

4134185,5,B003KVMULI,"Fabulous, insightful documentary! As a social worker in a major teaching hospital in New York City, I have  witnessed first hand the adverse  impact that our current health care system has had on both health care providers as well as patients. This documentary does an exemplary job in exposing the daily realities of the experiences shared by many physicians around the United States.  The profession of healing has now been replaced with a culture of bureaucratic red tape that strictly defines the level and intensity of care that patients receive.  So many of those that came into the medical profession with great talents and dreams of making substantial differences in people's lives have been reduced to providing medical treatment within the confines of insurance enterprises that have never laid eyes on the patient.

It should be requred for all pre med students.  A nurse friend of my told me a while ago that people going to medical school today are "" missing a part of their brain"". I told her that people going to medical school are not crazy, they are just misguided. Instead of trying to explain why, for all those asking me about medicine, I am just going to give them this movie to watch. Maybe some truly caring individuals could be diverted to a field more valuable for society, instead of becoming doctors and by doing so further promoting this dehumanizing medical system and damaging their own physical and emotional health.

opened the first Annual Osler Symposium, a weeklong physician wellness conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in May of 2011.  The film was most excellent and right on target in probing the daily grind and assumptions that drives the current machine of medicine.  The film made it clear how our current system is breeding quite a bit of disaffection amongst the providers.  This film was not a typical `docu-quest' with a sweet redemptive or easy solution.  It was open, honest and certainly appropriate in its breathe and reach.  It focused each one of the participants to question our individual futures in Medicine and begs the viewer to get engaged in our own medical environmental searches and responses.  It was educating, inspiring, funny and poignant.  I would recommend it as a `must see and discuss' for anyone ready for a change.
