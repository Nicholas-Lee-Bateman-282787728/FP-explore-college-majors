8072080,4,B000A1INCG,"Why is noone mentioning on here that A dog Called Vengeance has very, very little sound. As in you can turn your tv all the way up, and just barely hear it? That sucks, makes it practically unwatchable, but the other movie is amazing! I'll get around to watching Dog someday, hopefully",1428192000,,285,4.5
8072081,4,B000A1INCG,"We purchased this video strictly for the movie ""A Dog Called Vengeance"".  There are several ""Vengeance"" movies, and this one is a bit older and much harder to find, especially since it is also known by several other titles, including ""El Perro"", ""The Dog"", and simply ""Vengeance"".  We were very glad to finally find the movie; however, I must add that this is a very poor quality video.  We enjoyed the plot, but if video quality is of utmost importance, I wouldn't recommend this one.",1414195200,,485,4.682352941176471
8072082,5,B000A1INCG,TOP NOTCH ALL THE WAY!!! GREAT STUFF!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++++++++++,1404259200,,74,8.375
8072083,5,B000A1INCG,"A great pairing!

A Dog called Vengeance stars Jason Miller(Father Karis from the Exorcist)as an escaped prisoner from a South American prison.

He accidently kills a guard and the last command he gives to his dog is `Kill'!!

The chase is on!

Great suspense and drama.

Never heard of this film before now.

Scorpion Thunderbolt is a weird film from Hong Kong about a series of murders where the victims seem to be kiiled by a giant snake.

Turns out the snake is really a woman who shape shifts.

Added to this madness is sword&sandal/kung fu/ninja/spaghetti western star Richard Harrison!!

Who says you can't add cheese to your chinese food???

Fantastic cover art on front and back(very clever designing)and a budget price make these a must have item.",1135641600,5,757,4.84375
