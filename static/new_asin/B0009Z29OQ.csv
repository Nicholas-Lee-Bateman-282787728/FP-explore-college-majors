8070643,5,B0009Z29OQ,"Great video.  Very helpful with drills, ideas, and actual playing tips!",1405382400,,71,5.454545454545454
8070644,3,B0009Z29OQ,"This product had nothing that I thought were secrets of the pros. It is a good DVD for someone trying to take it to the next level,  C to B class for example. I consider myself a B and I learn very little.",1314835200,,205,3.7674418604651163

Not to be too negative, but this blows away the other DVDs I bought before it. It is incredible that Mr. Winterton is clearly giving away so much information on improving your game for this price when he has camps and other ways of generating higher revenue. Sorry to show my ignorance, but being newish to racquetball, I had not heard of him before reviewing this item for purchase. It is clear he knows the game extremely well in both his credentials and his way of simplifying each tidbit that the subjects could improve. I am confident that this instructional video will drastically reduce the amount of time it takes me to move up to the A level... and hopefully up from there. If I don't move up to the A level in the next 3 months, I'll be sure to update my review and explain how I have fowled up this incredible tool. I apologize that this review seems unrealistically positive.",1268697600,,1052,4.455958549222798
8070646,1,B0009Z29OQ,I was hoping for a video that showed different shots and serves.  It was basically a video of him giving a lesson to people of different skill sets.  Price was a little steep for what I received.,1206057600,3,195,4.243243243243243
8070647,3,B0009Z29OQ,Drills for the open player wanabe. Very little use to the local hacker trying to improve his game thru strategy. As a C player I was disappointed.,1185321600,3,146,4.444444444444445
8070648,3,B0009Z29OQ,"The drills & all that's OK, but I was expecting to see examples via real-play action.

After all, that's how you learn the most, since players doing drills don't have the same pressure than during a real game.",1168300800,2,209,4.5
8070649,5,B0009Z29OQ,"I think this is a great DVD.  I like the use of the slow-motion action of the different swings.  Also, there are many tips that i believe will be beneficial to most players.  I, myself, am a lower A player found many new things to work on, and I do definitely see great results.  However, there is one tiny thing that I didn't really like.  The instructional uses both right and left handers, so in the 'Forehand' part of the instruction, the right handers hit forehands, and the left handers hit backhands.  and the same goes of the backhand.  But overall, this DVD is awesome!  the drills are great too.  Jim Winterton has made a very nice DVD instructional video here!",1145318400,10,671,4.479338842975206
