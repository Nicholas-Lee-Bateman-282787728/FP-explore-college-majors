I don't agree with the earlier review that suggests these were taken from VHS tapes. They look like digital transfers to me, though not spectacular. What's important for American customers is that this is a Region 2 release, which means you can't play it here unless you have a multi-region DVD player. The 32-page book with the notes and the subtitles are in Spanish. But the book has great vintage movie stills and theater cards. The movies themselves are the original U.S. releases with English dialogue. ""The Common Law"" and ""The Life of Vergie Winters"" aren't available elsewhere, far as I can tell. If you're a pre-code fan, you should go for it. FYI, the same company also put out a pre-code Irene Dunne set.",1464998400,2,824,4.729166666666667
8653193,1,B00JQ1VWC4,"I bought this because it contains some rare films, at least on DVD. It is the only version of ""The Common Law"" I have come across, for instance.

However, the picture quality on these DVDs is not good. Focus is soft, and they lack details. Don't know if they were taken from video tapes, or 16mm prints, if they used a soften/unsharp filter to compensate other quality problems, or they just did a 2nd rate job with the scans. But regardless of why, these do not have the video quality I expect from DVDs. Not Alpha Video bad, but not Warner Archive acceptable either. If this were a discount set, I would have given it a better rating. But the set is not cheap, and I expect more when paying for more.

Buy this only if the softness of the video is acceptable to you at this price.",1448236800,7,782,4.277027027027027
