8586493,5,B00CU9QD6E,"Our 1-1/2 and 3 year old babies love it, I as a parent love it as well because this was recorded/produce by native Spanish speakers, it doesn't sound ""funny"" or ""wrong"" like Dora and Diego; and not ""Spanglish"" is used here (as a parent I hate Dora The Explorer because Spanglish use).

Also, we like the fact that they use a pretty standard Spanish, proper terms and pronunciation. If any, we could distinguish a little Chilean and Spain accent. Both my wife and I are native Spanish speakers raised in different countries and sometimes having different words for the same object/situation, etc. and we both understand and approve the pronunciation.

If looking for a way of raising bilingual kids, this is a good choice.",1468368000,,721,4.806451612903226
8586494,5,B00CU9QD6E,The primary language in my home is English but it's important to me that my daughter learns Spanish to communicate with her grandparents. This DVD is entertaining and helps expose her to the language. She is very entertained and I catch myself singing the songs throughout my day because they are catchy.,1453334400,,304,4.865384615384615

8586498,5,B00CU9QD6E,"We bought this DVD (as well as ""Little Pim"") as a Christmas present for our 14-month old daughter.  We are trying to expose her to a second language from a young age. At first I didn't care for it.  The sound quality isn't the greatest.  It isn't as ""instructional"" as ""Little Pim"".  That said, she really likes this DVD.  She enjoys the songs and the images.  The songs are very catchy.  My husband and I find ourselves singing along.  We've played this DVD almost daily since we purchased it.",1424563200,,494,4.47191011235955
8586499,5,B00CU9QD6E,I bought this DVD when my oldest (now 5) was a baby. All 3 of my children LOVE this video and its one of my favorites as a parent. The songs are great and the kids have learned Spanish as a result. Even before 2 my kids knew various Spanish words after seeing this DVD. I highly recommend it.,1400716800,,292,3.9661016949152543
