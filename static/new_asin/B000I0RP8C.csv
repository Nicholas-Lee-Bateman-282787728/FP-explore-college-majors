8143076,1,B000I0RP8C,not for young beginners at all.,1415232000,,31,4.333333333333333
8143077,4,B000I0RP8C,"The instructor is great - she does a good job walking you through the combinations, this is definately a beginner level class. Like a previous review said she does give lots of explainations so if you have a ballet background and just want the combinations, fast forward. Overall it's exactly what I expected and it's perfect to help me get back into dance.",1360022400,5,357,4.682539682539683
8143078,5,B000I0RP8C,"I own several beginner Ballet instructional videos. This is definitely one of the best for true ballet beginners. Unlike
David Howard's Ballet Class for Beginners, which is more on the demonstration side than actually trying to explain each movement in relative details. Someone complaint about too much explanation. However, as a ballet beginner myself, I found the explanation is just adequate compared to Finis Jhung's which is way too much and not always clear/helpful for me. However, I have to agree the production Quality is poor: Old-fashion looking studio and so-so audio quality. But the poor production doesn't affect my learning anyway.",1354579200,5,648,5.362745098039215
8143079,5,B000I0RP8C,"I really liked the video and thought it was worthwhile. The video production and audio quality is not the greatest, but if your like me and don't have access to regular ballet classes, then this video is worthwhile. There are better ballet videos out there, but this one is perfect for beginners.",1310169600,3,296,4.711538461538462
8143080,2,B000I0RP8C,"I was looking for Ballet exercise than an instructional class. In addition the video quality and the accompanying music was poor.  I have had better ones bought on Amazon.com. Having said that, it is a very good instructional video for those who are actually looking for detailed explanation of execution of barre and center works.",1229904000,8,331,5.0181818181818185
