8097770,5,B000CCLSNY,"I love this concert. This is the only concert available that I know of that has young Lauren Frost portraying Barbara as a teenager just starting out and  the terrific split screen of Barbara live, Lauren Frost, and a clip of Barbara in Yentl singing Papa Can You Here Me and A Piece of Sky, both from Yentl. Lauren Frost is introduced as ""playing mini me"" by Barbara. It's the best version I have ever seen or heard of those 2 songs. I love the chat she has with Shirley MacLaine for the Y2K. It's amazing to think this was a live concert performed on New Years Eve as we entered the new millennium. Of all of Barbara's live concerts that have been recorded, this is without a doubt my favorite. I prefer the songs that Barbara performs from many of the hit Broadway shows to some of the rock songs she's performed over the years. Songs included in this concert: You'll Never Know; Something's Coming, Cry Me a River, The Way We Were, Evergreen, Lover, Come Back to Me, songs from Funny Girl which she performed both on Broadway and in film...Second Hand Rose/Don't Rain on My Parade, Something Wonderful, Being Alive, Miss Marmelstein, and so many others that  she performed in movies and Basin Street East. There also many duets that she performed with other famous singers over the years. She's had a long career and so the list is long of all the songs you will find in this concert. It the best and if you love listening to Barbara Streisand sing, you will love this concert. I highly recommend it.",1518825600,,1504,4.485401459854015
