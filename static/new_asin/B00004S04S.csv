The ones from the 70's were mostly in color and there was a few sprinkled in there, mostly at the begining.  they were all fun to watch and it was great to take a look back at the types of things that were marketed to children then and the innocence in which it was done.  the word ""innocence"" is always used loosely when people speak about the 50's, 60's & 70's but in light of what we see today, it really was innocent, we just didn't know it.  these commercials--with the old songs, snappy jingles, corny slogans and simple dolls, give you a glimpse at how easy to please children were back in those days.  to say ""times have changed"" is the understatement to end all understatements.  this little gem of a video shows you what it was like when all most little girls wanted out of life was a doll to play with.

Did anyone notice 9yr old Patty Duke in the ""Baby Toodles"" commercial?  or Pamela Ferdin (Fern from ""Charlottes Web"") in the Barbie Commerical?

the most annoying thing about this video is the large blue ""The Windmill Group"" logo that stayed fixed in the corner of all the commercials---which for me, took something away from each commercial.  I guess the ""The Windmill Group"" is the company who produced the video and wanted to make sure there was no copyright infringments, which is understandable but annoying, none the less....and for that reason alone I can only give this video 3 stars.",1117670400,2,1550,4.516129032258065
7921528,3,B00004S04S,Most of the commercials were from the 1950's and 1960's.  All of them were in black and white except for the Charlie's Angels Dolls commercial.  The commercials were cute and I did enjoy watching them. I expected to see more commercials in color from the 1970's which the video did not show.,970531200,5,291,4.576923076923077
