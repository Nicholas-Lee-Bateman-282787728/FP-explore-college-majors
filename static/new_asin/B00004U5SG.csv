1354902,4,B00004U5SG,"This disk has at least one more episode that they will probably never show you on Cartoon Network, lemme give ya a hint, it's the one with ""Teddy Bomber"".  That alone should prompt fans of the series to go out and buy it.
Although not too awful revealing about any of the characters (except one episode about Jet, but even that doesn't really say a lot), this DVD does have a lot of comic relief (Yeah, lots of Ed and Ein, hence the cover art).
The final goof off disk before everything starts to wrap up and this great series comes to a close.  I'd praise it more, but it would be to no effect, 90% of the people who buy this disk will not mearly do so because I told them it is great, they will do so because they have the other previous 4.

1354903,4,B00004U5SG,"Session 5 is nowhere near the quality of the other episodes. For some reason the animation quality skyrockets in this session, but the stories fall into the creative void. They`re still enjoyable, but their not cowboy bebop. With the last episode,however, all is forgiven. Spike must go up against Andy the cowboy bounty hunter (Who is a mockery of Trigun`s Vash Stampede.)",996278400,,373,5.032258064516129
1354904,4,B00004U5SG,"Cowboy Bebop is, in this reviewer's opinion, the finest series that anime currently has to offer. The animation is top-notch, the writing is consistently excellent, the English voice work is amazingly good, and the soundtrack (provided by Yoko Kanno) is absolutely brilliant throughout the entire series. It's a pity that the series had such a short run-- what's available in these six DVD volumes constitutes the entire twenty-six episode series. Nevertheless, this is one series every anime fan must have, and a series I would also recommend to fans of TV shows such as Miami Vice.
  Cowboy Bebop's basic structure allows each episode to be a full-fledged story all its own, with the main characters-- Spike, Jett, Faye, and Edward-- serving to connect them all. While there is a consistency to the entire series outside of the characters-- mainly concerning each character's exploration of his/her identity-- this is a more episodic anime series than something such as Evangelion, and yet far less formulaic than Dragon Ball Z and its brethren. I cannot stress how incredibly good the writing is here-- each episode is a self-contained story full of integrity: sometimes dramatic, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but always effective each time without sacrificing any of the show's core values.
  Each DVD disc in this series is a bargain-- five episodes per disc for Volumes One and Two, and four episodes per disc thereafter. Extras are limited, but the video quality is outstanding, and both Japanese/English tracks are provided, with English subtitles. The English voice acting is very impressive--  dialogue is still intelligent following the translation, lip synching is dead-on, and the voice actors are almost as endearing as the characters they portray.
  While Volume Five is as much worth a purchase as the other discs in this series, it has some low points that manage to drag it down a bit. The main one that should be addressed is the ""Pierrot le Fot"" episode, which concerns a man bred as a perfect killing machine. While this episode contains a remarkable fight scene, it's one of the more flawed episodes of Cowboy Bebop; a backstory sequence serves to remove the viewer's disdain for this episode's villain right before said villain is killed and never mentioned again-- similar to the case of an imprisoned criminal who is found to be innocent right before he is executed, yet this information is judged to be insignificant afterwards because the criminal is already dead. ... ""Boogie Woogie Feng Shui"" and ""Wild Horses"" are entertaining but largely forgettable relative to the other episodes in this series. ""Cowboy Funk"" is definitely the highlight of this disc: the character of Andy is hilarious, as is the Teddy Bomber.",990489600,5,2746,5.102449888641425
1354905,5,B00004U5SG,"Cowboy Bebop was not intended to be taken lightly.  You should not watch this series if you are easily bored, for the pace averages on the slower side.  However, if you enjoy an anime that is well crafted and drawn, that has superb music, that has interesting characters, with highly interesting episode stories, and an intriguing sub-story;  this is the anime for you. Wild Horses finally gives us a bit more information about Spike's ride, the Swordfish II (not enough unfortunately).  This is a decent episode, though it would have been nicer if they expounded on the ship and her maker. Pierrot La Fou is an amazing episode that showcases once more Spike's insane fighting abilities and his whatever happens happens attitude.  Great episode with fast action in a relatively calm series.  Some blood. Boogie Woogie Feng-Shui is a decent episode that gives us a little more information on Jet and Ein (very little on Ein). Cowboy Funk is a hilarious episode that pits Spike against the other most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy- Andy!!  Possibly the greatest Udon Western ever.
Buy this DVD, buy the series.  You will watch it over and over again.

1354906,5,B00004U5SG,"Cowboy Bebop is, by far, one of the best TV series to come from Japan.  Just don't take it too seriously, it is, after all, the '70s and the Wild West mixed into one (someone beat me to that punch already, damn!) One just needs to watch the Low-Rider/Horseback care chase to see that.
But it doesn't come out the worse for wear mixing two wildly different genres, and the fifth DVD shows this off.  Even after 21 episodes this show is more than fun to watch.  Basically, if you're wondering whether to pick up this or something new, don't worry: This has more of the same fun of the series.",975196800,7,590,4.297297297297297
1354907,4,B00004U5SG,"Cowboy Bebop combines the classic Wild West with what was best about the 70s. What was best about the 70s, you ask? Ok, not much, but listen to the soundtrack to Cowboy Bebop and you'll know what I mean. The intro animation itself is reminiscent of something close to Charlie's Angels.
Muscle car and Soul Train references aside, Cowboy Bebop is one of the most richly animated series I've ever seen. It balances serious plots with humorous ones and sometimes combines the two for an enhanced effect.
My only complaint is that I would have liked to witness more episodes detailing Spike's past with Julia. There just isn't enough of that story, the one that interests me the most.
But there must be something about this series that never leaves my mind. Sometimes I find myself speaking the words ""Bloody Eye"" out loud for no particular reason in that broken Japanese rendition of English.",972950400,,889,4.779220779220779

1354909,2,B00004U5SG,"Sheesh, in every episode of Cowboy Bebop the animators of the series  congratulate themselves on how groundbreaking and original their series is.  Well, I hate to break it to you, but the series isn't that original or  groundbreaking. Many old anime genres and plots are copied and the series  itself never really progresses anywhere at all... the characters are barely  delved into w/ any depth and as the series goes on the stories get thinner  and thinner. The best episode by far is the first, having some pretty cool  action scenes, but after that what little action there is is pretty lame.  The best character in the series is a quirky little hacker genius named Ed.  The episodes w/ Ed are worth watching.
What probably most soured me on  the series is the unbelievably lame ending. The cheese oozing out of the  last few episodes actually angered me more than entertained. I tried to  forget as quickly as possible what I had just seen, it was so stupid.",968284800,4,963,4.666666666666667
1354910,5,B00004U5SG,"There's no doubt about it the series cowboy bebop is excellent...  If you ever seen any ""Anime"" in your lifetime let it be this series.  You couldn't even be close to right if you were to say that this was just a cartoon, it  certainly isn't...  This series is for people around the age of 17 and up,  it's no child's play.  The series plots are incredibly in depth, you'll  love it.  When I first sow this DVD my first reaction was how poetic it  was, I couldn't believe it.  I have seen many ""Anime"" series before but  this takes the cake.  You can't just go about to buy only this one DVD, you  really have to have the hole collection, believe me you'll want it.  Take  my advice on this, you've never seen a show like this before, and you  probably won't again so see it while it's hot.",961632000,16,790,4.166666666666667

1354923,5,B00004U5SG,"I must say I'm quite relieved to find that Cowboy Bebop is rebounding back after the slight dip in episode quality I noticed in DVD3 and to a lesser extent in DVD4. I'm happy to report that 3/4 of this DVD is top-quality Bebop material, and it definitely deserves to be a part of every anime fan's library.
Episode 19 - Wild Horses
 If there is any episode on this disc which didn't quite live up to the Bebop name, it was Wild Horses. The plot is decent enough, but things just seem to move along a bit too slowly.
Episode 20 - Pierrot Le Fou
 Unquestionably the best episode of the group, Pierrot has comedy and action but most of all, it reeks of creativity. I always enjoy the unique episodes the best, and this one hooked me right from the start.
Episode 21 - Boogie Woogie Feng Shui
 A decent episode marred only by the fact that the new guest character is almost as annoying as Ed. Otherwise, the space firefight was cool.
Episode 22 - Cowboy Funk
 Another great episode, obviously intented for some comedic relief after the somewhat emotional end to Boogie Woogie. Andy is a cool character, and the bounty here is a really funny guy.
 This DVD is a worthy member of the Cowboy Bebop library.",1072396800,2,1199,4.382882882882883
1354924,5,B00004U5SG,"The second to last DVD shows exactly how crazy the future can be by throwing in wild-crazy characters (much like Sympathy for the Devil, episode 6)
19: Wild Horses: New character: the old spacer that gave Spike his ship.  This episode has some good space-scenes in it, especially the search-and-rescue attempt.
20: Pierrot Le Fou: New Character: Tongpu, the most twisted murderer in all of cinematic existence.  Spike runs into the murderer, apparently killing random drug lords, and Spike gets away.  Later, the final showdown happens in an amusement park.
21: Boogie-Woogie Feng-Shui: Jet-isode, New Character: Jet's old friend's daughter.  She seeks out Jet to find her father (actually they meet in an awkword place, thanks to something called universal feng shui.
22: Cowboy Funk: Nearly a Spike-isode.  A new face (Andy) shows up; a ""real"" cowboy, about as smart as horse droppings but somehow always in the right place at the right time.  The crew (mainly Faye) tells Spike that he's just like Andy, but most viewers call her a dumbass at this point.  Then, comedy insues.
The extras here aren't too great (like the rest of the DVDs), but I think Le Fou and Funk are good enough to make this DVD extremely buyable.",1066608000,,1221,4.898058252427185
1354925,5,B00004U5SG,"Yes, I must say that ""Cowboy Funk"" is one of the best episodes in the series, and certainly one of the funniest. Plus, the other episodes are just as good. Too bad it's getting towards the end. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Anime or wants to get into Anime.",1055980800,,271,4.230769230769231
1354926,5,B00004U5SG,"Session 5 is almost a break before the episodes that will wrap up the series.  Here we get to enjoy what is quintessential Bebop - humor, some scares, and stories with an unexpected twist.  Each of these stories introduces a unique character.  None will reappear, although is a few circumstances the viewer will wish otherwise.  We also get to see an unexpected side of Jet and Spike making a complete idiot of himself (which is normal, I guess).
With only one DVD left to go in this series, I am already experiencing Bebop withdrawal.  No matter what else I am reading or watching, Cowboy Bebop has always been a welcome change of pace.  If you have been watching these along with me I'm sure you have discovered the same thing.
Episode 19 - While Spike is getting his old ship overhauled by Doohan - who assembled the Swordfish out of scrap years ago - Faye and Jet try to catch some pirates and get a computer virus instead.  Look for a ghost out of the past to come to the rescue.
Episode 20 - Jet gets a note from an old friend and feng-shui master.  When he arrives he finds Pao's daughter instead and starts on a wild chase for the 'sun stone.'  This time Ein puts his paw on the answer and Ed figures it out.
Episode 21 - Spike stumbles into the middle of an assassination and finds that he is now being hunted by a deadly maniac in a top hat and ruffles.  'Mad Pierrot' decides Spike has to go to the 'fun' house.
Episode 22 - Imagine a bounty hunter with one-third the intelligence of a pumpkin and three times the accident proneness of Faye and you have Andy and his trusty horse.  Of course, Andy and Spike have duke it out for who owns the title of 'real' cowboy - and avoid being blown to smithereens by a teddy bear.",1045526400,3,1731,4.295384615384616
1354927,5,B00004U5SG,"""Pierrot Le Fou"" alone is worth the price of the DVD.  Even if two episodes are ho-hum by Bebop standards--as some reviews claim--they are better than the vast majority of other anime.  Those episodes probably seem so subpar because they are packaged with two absolute classics.",1036454400,,278,5.021739130434782
1354928,5,B00004U5SG,"I own all of Bebop on DVD.  It's my favorite animes (and I have a lot of anime on DVD).  As good as the series is, I always find myself having to watch this episode.  It's so twisted, I can't get enough of it.  Other than The Ballad of Fallen Angels and The Real Folk Blues 1 & 2, this has to be my favorite episode.  It's one of the most action-packed episodes in the series, and it's very...... unique.  This episode teaches one lesson: never make fun of fat guys wearing funny hats.",1029974400,,485,4.1063829787234045
1354929,5,B00004U5SG,"It was inevitable: after an exceptional run of superb episodes that entertained us to no end, Session 5 provides us with a couple of episodes that sadly do not live up to the excellence that ""Cowboy Bebop"" had built. And yet despite these couple of episodes' lower-than-expected quality, they aren't completely terrible, and Session 5 does give us a couple of other episodes that do live up to the expected standard.
With eighteen episodes so far completed and all of them considered classics, it should be no surprise to see that the show's creators had probably run out of ideas near the end. Whereas previous episodes were unique and innovative, two episodes in Episodes 19-22 feel more formulaic than anything else. Episode 19, ""Wild Horses"", tries to intrigue us by telling us about Spike's prized starship but fails to build up enough attraction in its story. Episode 21, ""Boogie-Woogie Fen-Shui"", is considered the worst ""Cowboy Bebop"" of all, and with good reason, thanks to its well-meant but shoddily executed story. These two episodes sadly remind us that even great shows like ""Cowboy Bebop"" can fall from grace every now and then.
Thankfully, right after falling from grace, ""Cowboy Bebop"" gets back on its feet with the other two episodes of Session 5. ""Pierrot Le Fou"" and ""Cowboy Funk"", in fact, are perhaps the two episodes that showcase the series varying appeals. While ""Pierrot Le Fou"" has a dark, sinister atmosphere and gloomy premise, ""Cowboy Funk"" shows off a gullible and lighthearted story that alone almost makes up for the two less stellar episodes. While all four episodes work the magic of the ""Cowboy Bebop"" series, only episodes 20 and 22 work the magic right. Of course, episodes 19 and 21 aren't entirely horrible; however, they are the only two episodes that have dared to defy the quality that this anime demands.
Other than the quality of the episodes, everything else remains top notch. Visuals are as eye-catching as ever, and Yoko Kanno's genius still shines through with her unclassifiable brand of music. And the dubbing cast, even through these episodes, still puts their heart and soul into their characters.
All in all, Session 5 is the low point of the ""Cowboy Bebop"" series, even though the lowest point is still remarkably high. While a couple of episodes stumbled, they aren't enough to weaken the overall quality that this anime series has given us. Skipping Session 5 would be ridiculous, as you'd be missing out on two wonderful episodes amidst the lower-quality ones. Of course, you'd have to watch all other episodes to truly appreciate these four, but if you're this far in the series you already knew that.",1027900800,4,2662,4.944196428571429
1354930,5,B00004U5SG,"This one is probably my least favorite of the series, but that just tells you how great the other DVD's are! WARNING theres a few SMALL spoilers, but nothing that will go anywhere near ruining the episode. If you hate being spoiled with even very little things then don't read.
Episode 19: Wild Horses- This one is one of the better ones on the DVD, you get to meet Doohan, the former owner of the Swordfish II. Plus Jet, Spike, and Faye go after their bounty heads...turns out they have a virus that they transmit by harpooning the attacking ships, giving them a little more trouble than they planned for.
A-
Episode 20: Pierrot Le Fou- Not only my favorite on this DVD, but one of my top 5 episodes in the whole series. Spike meets up with a strange person called Pierrot, he seems impossible to kill...not only that but he seems hell bent on killing Spike. Who is this strange person? you will find out.
A+
Episode 21: Boogie-Woogie Feng-Shui- A mysterious email gets sent to Jet, leading him to an old friend...he ends up meeting with his old friends daughter, Meifa. They go on a quest to figure out what the sun stone is leading them into some trouble...this episode is one of my least favorites in the series but its still entertaining.
C+
Episode 22: Cowboy Funk- I liked this episode alot, it's got a decent amount of humor in it like when Spike meets a new rival named Andy. They're both going after the bounty head ""Teddy Bomber""...with Spike and Andy, two of the best Bounty Hunters in the world, who will get him first?
B+
Overall- A- or 5 stars...this DVD mixes with great Action, humor, and is very entertaining overall. If your a fan of the series you can't do without this one.",1025740800,2,1694,4.467741935483871
