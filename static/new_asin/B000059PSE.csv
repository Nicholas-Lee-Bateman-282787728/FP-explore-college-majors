1408162,5,B000059PSE,"I say this is my second favorite movie because my very favorite is an old classic ""An Imitation Of Life"".  I'm a pretty hard sell on movies, but I'm hooked on this one. I've tried in vain to find the soundtrack, namely, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, that is played at the end of the movie.....Roberta Flack, eat your heart out! I can't remember the name of the person who played Joseph Finnes sidekick but, they were equally Awesome!!. The only downside to this movie was the young lady who played the love interest, she just didn't do it for me acting-wise. And  that is the ""ONLY"" downside to this movie.  I Loved it, I Highly Recommend it!...Enjoy!!",1020297600,2,659,4.429752066115703
1408163,4,B000059PSE,"A cabana boy (Joseph Feinnes) falls in love with a married woman (Gretchen Mol) who is staying at the vacation resort that employs him along with her politically powerful husband (Ray Liota). After a little maneuvering the cabana boy seduces the married woman and then inserts his jade stem in her jade passageway followed by tearful farewells and her inevitable return home. Consumed by passion the cabana boy follows her to Yonkers New York where he continues to park his jizzm wagon in her love garage until her husband gets wind of things and warns him to stay away. Upon failing to heed this advice, cabana boy is shot and left for dead, but as luck would have it, he survives with his head conveniently disfigured beyond recognition. In the spirit of Monte Christo, cabana boy takes a few years off to build a new identity complete with wealth and powerful fiscal/criminal credentials before returning to the Empire State to obtain vengeance and to reclaim the object of his desires. In case it isn't patently clear what he's up to, he takes the name ""Esquema"" and a fake South American (but not Brazilian) accent. Cabana boy insinuates himself in the husband's life, solves his racketeering problems and then demands his wife as payment. Before you can say, ""what is the point of revealing yourself if you're not going to kill him"", cabana boy seduces the wife again and runs off with her. The couple spend an idyllic night in the country during which cabana boy repeatedly inserts his splutter plug into the wife's love socket before the husband catches up to them and shoots cabana boy in the morning. During the inconclusive ambulance ride in which we guess that cabana boy will either wind up dead or further disfigured/disguised, the wife reminds him of how they first met.
Oddly enough, this film is so wretchedly bad that it's good. ""Forever Mine"" is poorly done to the point of being wildly entertaining. How Joseph Feinnes and Ray Liota got roped into this film is beyond me. Even more puzzling is how Ray Liota who electrified audiences with his portrayal of visceral villains in ""Something Wild"" and ""Good Fellows"" managed to play such an incompetent bad guy in this film. In scene after scene, Liota attempts to be threatening and menacing but comes across as a nice family man doing his best to play a bad guys. The only original part of this film is the bad acting and while irony may no longer be in vogue, this is precisely what makes this movie worth watching.",1011657600,4,2484,4.725806451612903
1408164,3,B000059PSE,"I watched Forever Mine last night and thought it was a pretty decent essay of an extramarital affair. We begin in the 1970's where Alan (Fiennes) is working at a swank hotel as a cabana boy. When he sees Ella, played by Mol, he falls instantly in love with her. The problem is she's married to a lowlife businessman (Ray Liotta, in full scumbag mode). They begin an affair which results in Alan getting disfigured from Liotta's goons and left for dead. Now it's 1987 and Alan is returning for revenge.
The dialogue is very cliche heavy, with dreamy declarations of love between Ella and Alan. But I thought that Fiennes and Mol were believable as the doomed duo. Liotta has got to stop playing the heavy. After seeing Heartbreakers and Blow, I know he's an amazing actor who can do so much more.",1003104000,4,795,4.527777777777778
1408165,3,B000059PSE,"When I was thinking about ordering this movie on DVD I somehow doubted ist quality since ""Forever Mine"" was never released theatrically in the USA. But after reading several reports about it I kinda liked the storyline although it's nothing special: man and woman fall in love with each other, sadly she's married so they break up, he follows her, the husband get's angry and attempts to kill his rival. Another reason for me to buy this movie was the fact that the cast includes Ray Liotta, who's definitely one of the most talented and underrated actors in recent movie history.
""Forever Mine"" starts extremely well (though I didn't like the opening credits) with beautiful locations and elegant direction but sadly Paul Schrader reduces the pace in the middle of the movie. For this reason you may need some patience to sit through this section. Another weakness is Joseph Fieness' accent. In my opinion it's simply too over the top and appears to be exaggerated and artificial. Don't get me wrong: I'm just an average German who learned English at school, maybe I'm wrong about this (please correct me if you think so) but his strange accent (at some points) almost ruined the movie for me. Still Fiennes' performance is quite OK (as long as you don't think about the accent) but he doesn't stand achance against beautiful and sexy Gretchen Mol (sadly her haircut looks awful in ""Forever Mine"") and especially Ray Liotta who's terrific in his usual bad guy role.
Thus ""Forever Mine"" is a nicely shot and well-acted movie though its only two weaknesses (slow moving center section, Fiennes' strange accent) might be crucial for some people.",997833600,3,1643,4.871428571428571
1408166,4,B000059PSE,"I enjoy writer-director Paul Schrader's work in general and many people do not. This film was no exception.  It is a love story with Joseph Fiennes's character in love with corrupt Ray Liotta's character's wife.  This is not ""Body Heat"" though.  It is not a who-done-it.  It is solely a love story and the hell the two characters go through as Liotta does everything possible to stop Fiennes in his tracks.  Fiennes is seen in two guises, as a young, attractive cabana boy who first sees the wife on the beach and years later as a shadowy powerful figure in his own right who has come back to even some scores.  There is a Catholic sensibility to all of Schrader's work and that is true of this one. I suppose since I am a lapsed Catholic that is a big part of his appeal to me.  Guilt, obsession, revenge, and  forgiveness permeate all of his work, including this film.

1408168,2,B000059PSE,"Nice to see the Fiennes people here at work!
As far as 'Forever Mine' being a love story, well, there's no mistake there! 'Forever Mine' is like American Gigolo, meets Scar Face, meets the English Patient. OY! What a mess! And far less stylish I might ad. The plot has holes too large to fill in with roving tanks. And the dialogue! Double OY! (Paraphrasing here) ""....Do you want this marriage to work...""? I wasn't sure if whether Liotta wanted the marriage to work with that line! ""...Remember the night we walked for blocks in the snow because we couldn't get a taxi""?  Huh? Some of Fiennes' lines were just as dreadful!
There was a comment about miscasting and Fiennes not being convincing enough to be taken seriously in the role that smitten out of the blue cabana boy/turned thug deviously driven by love and revenge. He is actually too nice, given ""the nature of the beast"". I don't know that Fiennes was truly miscast, it might simply have been direction. I don't know who is at fault.
I do have some good things to say. Fiennes' American accent is very good considering many British actors don't fair well with them. And the Cuban accent didn't seem to come off too badly. However, someone of Cuban background might prove a better judge.  Ray Liotta is consistant. (Don't ask me what I meant by that) Gretchen Mol is fine considering what she had to work with.
While I can appreciate Mr. Fiennes as a good actor with enormous potential, it's probably a good, no wait, a GREAT thing 'Shakespeare In Love' hit the big screen before this one hit the little one!  I agree with one of the other reviewers, that Fiennes' talent (along with the other actors) is wasted! An actor really never knows exactly what kind of mess he's gotten himself into until mid-way through or the finished product. Who knew?!
I remember reading stories that Schrader had difficulties in getting 'Forever Mine' to the big screen, it's just as well. I can forgive them this trespass, but I certainly can't defend this!
One other thing. Who was responsible for the makeup job regarding Fiennes'disfigurement? Whoa! Tight budget?",992908800,3,2110,4.712737127371274

1408203,4,B000059PSE,"This film is a modern day, ""The Count of Monte Cristo""  (Revenge) and a dash of ""Death in Venice"" (Obsession)
The story is riveting. The very finest actors: Joseph Fiennes (""Enemy at the Gates""). Ray Liotta (""Goodfelles"")
Gretchen Mol (""Manchester by the Sea"") She is Lovely. A former model.

1408388,1,B000059PSE,"This film has great actors, but they can't save it from a nonsensical screenplay. It's a not-so-stylish period piece, running from the early 1970s to late 1980s, and is largely told via flashback. Basically, over the course of a few days in 1973, a cabana boy falls so madly in love with a married guest at the Florida hotel at which he works that he spends the next 14 years obssessing over her. Even though her husband is a terrible person who does terrible things, she stays with him and somehow isn't held accountable by either man for her poor choices--they both worship her. Gretchen Mol is beautiful but...there isn't enough substance to support this plot. Everything is surface level and quite frankly silly. Ray Liotta plays a charicature of a sleazy politician and jealous husband. Joseph Fiennes as the cabana boy is given nothing to work with; his character has no back story (other than having a mother) and as the script suggests, he seems to have existed for the sole purpose of falling hopelessly in love with Gretchen Mol's character, who married for money and never wants to be poor again. There's also a strange attempt to pin the reason for her staying with her awful husband on devout Catholicism--even after she learns he did something disgraceful to her lover. Whether she stays with him for money or because of religion, there is no basis for believability. About halfway through the movie the focus becomes revenge and it really goes off the deep end. I try not to give too much away in reviews and honestly, any in-depth discussion of this movie would have more depth than the movie itself and isn't really worth it. Neither is sitting through ""Forever Mine."" If you're looking for a romantic movie about a love that survives trials, tribulations and a lengthy separation, watch or rewatch ""The Notebook."" If you're looking for a movie about a love triangle that effectively tackles the quandries of religion and adultery, watch ""The End of the Affair,"" a gorgeous period piece that ironically stars Joseph Fiennes' brother Ralph.",1469923200,5,2056,4.84375

This man is played by Joseph Fiennes. Unfortunately, the woman of his dreams is married to a dangerous and powerful man. She falls desperately in love with Joseph's character. Somehow the husband, Mark, played by Ray Liotta, finds out about the affair and plots to kill Joseph's character. Miraculously Joseph survives. As the years go by Joseph does not give up on his chance to be with the love of his life, Ella, played by Gretchen Mol. Joseph's character, has two names, Manuel and Alan. Manuel becomes Alan after his face is destroyed by Mark's attempt to kill him. Manuel as Alan transforms himself into a successful business man and works out a plan to be in a position to be near Mark and Ella again. Alan plans to destroy Mark financially and win back Ella. If you want to know the rest of the story, watch the movie. It is surprisingly good. It kept my interest and made me wonder what would happen and how it would end.

It has more than a touch of ""noir"" quality to it; it is tinged with real human evil - and love - which, of course, are so closely related. This is the story of Alan and Ella - a tale of lovely,  twisted, obsessive-compulsive love (and how else can real love be if one is truly alive?). I saw it three times on TV; finally, I just had to have it - to give to a very special lady-love. I only watched it a couple more times and I had to give it to my lovely lady. ""Forever Mine"" can now be called, ""Our Movie."" This story captures the very essence - the cutting edge - of love/hate. It was captured long ago in a movie called, ""A Man and A Woman"" - the sound track of which I have treasured for years and years, having the haunting, Latin-feel of music by Antonio Carlos Jobim.

1408693,5,B000059PSE,"Just saw this movie on Netflix. Can't remember when the aftermath of viewing a love story of this caliber ignited my emotions so much. Don't understand why it was not in theaters. Patronize local theaters weekly,this movie deserved to be shown. Certainly much better than many I've seen recently.

Question why people who are not professional critics dissect a story to such an exaggerated level. What the h-ll are they looking for? It's entertainment for the masses and will temporarily take your mind off troubles. Moreover,many messages are presented for all to consider.

Alan was a young man pursuing his dreams,falls in love with a weak neglected,lonely woman who choose's comfort over heartfelt feelings then regrets it. She then wise's up and realizes ""true love"" is more precious than $$$. This is where Ella begins to really show some genuine emotion\passion which had been somewhat lacking on her part. Don't condone adultery but when you stay in a marriage for all the wrong reasons the door is wide open. Maybe Alan was somewhat obsessed, love has that affect at times. Hard for some people to relate especially if they have never loved that deeply.

Purchased the DVD, listened to the director's commentary and apparently he wanted to create a love story with some old fashion,carry your heart on your sleeve dialogue. This included the cliffhanger ending leaving the viewer wondering about the climax. Did Alan live or die? How much should a man be expected to endure in the name of love? He was disfigured and shot three times. The director's explanation was very contradictory and did not flow with the intended theme.

Predictable vs Corny. I would opt for corny, as long as it's believable and creates a good feeling. People really need that, there is already enough sorrow.",1318204800,5,1793,4.966666666666667

1408696,2,B000059PSE,"Forever Mine suffers from a few serious problems, hence the low rating I'm giving it.

The most obvious problem- the entire first half of the film is dominated with some of the fruitiest, cliche and old-fashioned romantic segments I have honestly EVER seen. These romantic scenes are so ridiculously predictable and unbelievable like some teenage girls special fantasy that it's *really* tough to swallow this stuff.

However once all the sappy romance takes a much needed hike, the storyline gets going and the quality of the film increases a lot more. Once the main character gets his face blown off by a shotgun blast for having a relationship with a mans wife (and you can't really blame him either- just LOOK at how attractive that woman is!) the storyline really catches my attention.

Forever Mine is really just an unsatisfying blend of romance and drama, however the romance just happens to be REALLY terrible if you ask me. Maybe someone who's a professional romance specialist (does such a thing even exist?) would have a better appreciation for this kind of stuff, but me? Nooooo thank you.

Anyway, the second half of the film is about the deform-faced man returning 14 years later and on a quest for revenge to find the guy who shot him.

Unfortunately, despite the storyline changing into something radically different, it's still mostly taken up with a large amount of cheesy dialogue and secondrate acting abilities, but besides that, it's not *really* bad. Just tell yourself that the romance in the beginning actually will go somewhere eventually, or better yet, take my word for it!",1299283200,,1602,4.940520446096654

I usually enjoy even the bad Ray Liotta movies because he can be so delightfully crazy, but he isn't quite crazy enough in this one even though he's the bad guy (he does make an attempt toward the end to come through, but it's too late by then - anybody who has stuck with the movie this far, doesn't really care by now.). If you really want a star-crossed lover's tale, surely you can dig up something more exciting than this one; and there are definitely better revenge plots out there.

Jealous husband finds out about affair, ultimately choosing a violent conclusion to the drama. A ""road well travelled"" movie that is often nice to look at (especially Gretchen Mol) but ultimately fails with a strong sense of having ""been there before"". Ray Liotta as the jealous husband effectively sleepwalks through his role - effective because he's a natural at playing the ""prick."" Gretchen Mol is convincing as the beautiful wife torn between passion and comfort as long as she doesn't speak. Joseph Fiennes is actually quite effective and believable as the obsessively romantic cabana boy but does not quite succeed in making the transition to powerful gangster during the second half of the film. FOREVER MINE begins with a quote from Philosopher critic Walter Pater, ""It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art."" Fiennes as the cabana boy seems to emulate Pater's philosophical reverence for ""the moment"" as the ultimate truth, and the film is most effective in this realm. When director Schrader changes direction midway, from picturesque romantic drama to revenge suspense, the film looses its magic and ""the moment"" is lost.",1106784000,15,1300,5.195238095238095
1408721,3,B000059PSE,"I have felt that Paul Schrader is one of those artsy directors who critics love, but his movies rarely approach classic status, with the exception of ""Taxi Driver.""  In FOREVER MINE, which is indeed reminiscent of oldies like BACK STREET or MADAME X, Joseph Fiennes plays a cabana man, a beach boy, who finds himself madly in love with the lovely Gretchen Mol.  His reason for falling in love so quickly extends from seeing her come out of the ocean in a white bathing suit (Bo Derek in 10?).  Mol, of course, is recently married to her boss, the slimy Ray Liotta.  Their steamy affair sparks the first half of the movie, and then we flash forward about 14 years and we meet Fiennes again on an airplane, a new identity, heading for New York.  He wants revenge on Liotta, who after Mol confesses of her affair, had Fiennes killed, or so he thought.
This movie is filmed nicely and Mol does a job worthy of Lana Turner or Susan Hayward, but Fiennes is less passionate than a John Gavin, and Liotta is just wasted in a poorly written role.  That's the main problem with this movie---for a passionate film, it has no passion or soul.  How can we really care about Fiennes or even Mol, for that matter?  He is more in lust, and she is dumb enough to stay with Liotta, even after knowing what he did to Fiennes.

Hard to believe that any film could make Joseph Fiennes seem uncharasmatic or Ray Liotta appear talentless, but this one manages to bury them both underneath an avalanche of trite cliches and slow pacing.  Leading lady Gretchen Mol tries to bring life to her role through a series of overwrought grimaces, but she only comes off as a refugee from an old-fashioned melodrama.  The script is abysmal; rather than allowing the characters to show any real emotion, it has them spell out their feelings to the audience via a series of ""remember when's"".  As in, ""Remember when I first saw you and my heart stopped?""  Or, ""Remember when we drank beers and gazed passionately into each other's eyes?"" (snore)  The cheesy dialogue isn't helped at all by Angelo Badalmenti's syrupy score, or the slightly out-of-focus ""romantic"" photography.  On the whole, a silly and sophomoric dud that didn't make the theatrical rounds ... and isn't any better on home video.",1036800000,10,1015,5.005952380952381
1408725,3,B000059PSE,"Director Paul Schrader, known as writer too (of ""Taxi Driver"" and others), may not be everyone's favorite, and you are not impressed with his name any more, but still his style is unique in reminding me of those soapy, but engaging melodramas made in Hollywood in the 1950s.
Look at this story: Joseph Fiennes plays a towel boy (with a Spanish accent) at the beach of Miami, where he meets a newly-wed, but neglected wife (and Catholic) Gretchen Mol.  Her husband Ray Liotta is dealing some (shady) business, and while he is away from the hotel, Fiennes and Mol fall in love with each other.  Soon, however, sense of guilt compels her to confess the affair, and the enraged husband hires men to do what you know already when the film gets started.
Well, that's just a beginning.  The director makes Fiennes come back years later, under heavy disguise of beard and another hairstyle and ... but wait! this is the most tricky part of the film.  A British Fiennes, previously playing none other than the Bard, William Shakespeare, appears as a Hispanic American, and then he undergoes a physical transformation ... you really need a strong will to suspend the disbelief.  But when you get over that part, and forget the fact that Liotta is typecast as a lout again, you will be entertained pretty much.
The fact is the story is not important.  The obsession of the characters is playing the main part, and their acting is not bad, so the ride is quite agreeable, though predictable.  Perhaps it is Gretchen Mol that attracts the eyes of the audience, male ones in particular.  She is good as a wife torn between the love and the guilt.
As he always does, Paul Schrader sees the world from a different viewpoint, with our ordinary characteristics removed, and not-so-normal aspects exaggerated.  The gorgeous seaside hotel of the opening scene looks somehow different, or bizzare perhaps (with the score of Angelo Padalamenti, famous for David Lynch films), and the characaters speak often corny dialogues as if they know they belong to those soap opera world.  But that may be exactly the point.",1032998400,4,2092,4.786111111111111

1408727,4,B000059PSE,"After watching ""Attraction"", I promised myself to pre-oder this movie on DVD -- which I did, with no regret. But please don't take it the wrong way. I mean, this so-called ""romantic drama"" sucked big time, especially its Monte-Cristo-fourteen-year-later part. Even the flashbacks didn't seem to give a plausible, convincing picture. (An IMDB commentator from England wrote that when this film was shown at the Torun camerimage festival in Poland, ""the whole audience was in stitches, which would have been fine except this was supposed to be a romance"").  So true. Whoever could envision beautiful young Gretchen Mol's love at first sight with a beardless Joseph Fiennes must be a hopeless romantic. Whoever could go farther to explain her attraction to a disfigured Senor Esquema (whom she kissed passionately even BEFORE he revealed himself as her former lover) must be a genius in helpless romanticism. Ironically, despite all those flaws, I decided to give ""Forever Mine"" 4 stars instead of none. Not as a comfort to the movie makers who were undoubtedly obsessed with Alexandre Dumas and Gustave Flaubert's great books. Simply because Gretchen Mol was so lovely and so wasted in her role, just like what happened to her in ""Attraction"". This beautiful and talented actress deserved all those 4 stars. How she managed to turn a camera-required chemical into a fascinating love scene was beyond me. Of course she didn't get to save this turkey, but she did give those who admire her enough patience to wait for something better (like her shining role in ""The Thirteenth Floor""). I'll wait.",1022371200,,1592,5.076335877862595
7933882,3,B000059PSE,"It was entertaining and really not a bad movie overall. There were just a few very silly bits that made no sense and seemed almost like whoever wrote the screenplay or edited it had to cut down on time so rushed a few things that made it seem unrealistic and certain things that people in real life probably wouldn't do.
Like what, you ask? Well, for one thing when the leading couple first meet and ""fall in love"" it seems super fast and like they didn't spend any time together before deciding they were in love. It would have been more believable if they immediately got into a super obsessive lustful thing that then turned to love maybe just as she was leaving or even after she left if they realised they missed each other and were in love.
Also, Fiennes character dies this twice in the movie: inexplicably tells the powerful politician played by Ray Liotta, that he intends to take his wife from him. Both times he could have avoided being shot if he had just kept his mouth shut He could have run off with the girl and kept his body parts intact. But instead, particularly the second time around when he comes back from the grave it just makes no sense why he would taunt a powerful man about to lose almost everything and go to prison by telling him hes stealing his wife. He put her in danger as well as himself by doing that and it just seemed unrealistic unless he is a psycopath. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe he was a psycho who fell in love and would do anything for the woman he loved. But also couldn't help but pull this my morality is so much higher than yours. My ability to love is so much greater than yours thing over Liotta, not once but twice.
There was also no indication that Liotta's character wasn;t a good husband. It isn't as though she were miserable. It just seemed she fell in love for some reason with the pool boy she didn'e even know. And then did it again later on, That's the other thing that I thought was a bit silly. When she fell in love with the spanish version of Fiennes character it made no sense as to why she fell in love that fast with him again, seeing as they had next to no private scenes together. But she just was all of a sudden in love with the Spanish man before she even knew he was the pool boy from 13 years prior.
The last thing that I found unrealistic was when Fiennes was shot he was supposedly buried in cement. They didn't show him getting out of that. just suddenly showing up grievously injured at his friends doorstep in Florida. But he was shot in NY. So how did he get from NY to Miami without dying of blood loss? Or without having someone try and help him, or calling an ambulance or the cops.
Aside from those things, the movie was overall fine. It should entertain anyone who watches it.",1525305600,,2765,4.278625954198473

I can forgive the husband not remembering the guy, but not the woman.  It stretched credibility to the breaking point and made everything so ridiculous, I lost all desire to continue.

It was very sad at times and I really did not like the ending at all. To me it seemed like a tragic love story but it was a good movie overall to watch if you like love and drama mixed together. I wished they would have made a better beginning and ending to the movie but it was a good love/drama movie to watch.,1519257600,,490,3.8613861386138613
