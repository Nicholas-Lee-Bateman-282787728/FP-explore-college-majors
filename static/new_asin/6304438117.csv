7870969,5,6304438117,"Absolutely loved this documentary. Still, it's too bad that two-years of filming was reduced down to only one hour. Although the one-hour time-frame allowed for a tight, nicely rounded ""story,"" one can only wonder what subtle information about the puma's behaviour had to be ""cut"".",1418083200,,281,5.266666666666667
7870970,4,6304438117,"This is a typically well-produced National Geographic movie about the puma. The puma's an elusive animal, and filmmaker Hugh Miles has done an extraordinary job spending two years in Chile filming his subject. The filming is very good, the narration (by Mr Miles) is excellent, and the overall quality of the film is very good.

Why 4 and not 5 stars, then?

Well, maybe I am comparing with wildlife films shot in Africa, which track other big cats that are probably less elusive than the puma and are present in greater numbers. The action in those (African) movies is more explicit and greater in quantity than in this movie about the puma - whether it is about mating, the kills, the giving birth to cubs or family life in general. There's less actual footage about those things in this movie than  narration and the filmmaker's descriptions.

For all that, it is a very interesting movie, but it's just not as riveting as some others from National Geographic. Definitely recommended, though.",1143417600,3,995,4.8352941176470585
7870971,5,6304438117,The majestic mountain lion is filmed scaling daunting and seemingly impossible cliffs over stunning backdrops of some of the most beautiful natural habitats in the world. In my opinion this is truly one of the best-filmed wildlife documentaries.,1139702400,,245,5.473684210526316
