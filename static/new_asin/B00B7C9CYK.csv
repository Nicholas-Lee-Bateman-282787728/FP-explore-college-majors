8563572,5,B00B7C9CYK,"The talent, creativity and fear is so obvious you can almost taste it.  What these people do in just 24 hours will make you realize that live theatre is not easy or for the faint of heart.  Buckle up and enjoy the ride!",1397088000,,219,4.069767441860465
8563573,4,B00B7C9CYK,An extremely entertaining film. I'm a big Rachel Dratch fan and I loved seeing her in this element. The work the cast and crew complete in such a short period of time is very impressive. It's great to get a behind-the-scenes look. I'd recommend to anyone looking to get into performing arts.,1369353600,,291,4.615384615384615
8563574,5,B00B7C9CYK,"Even more entertaining than anticipated! It gives the audience a chance to see actor/comedians like Rachel Dratch and Jesse Tyler Ferguson in a completely different setting.

8563575,5,B00B7C9CYK,"A phenomenally clever  behind-the -scenes view of the making of a Broadway Show. Imagine what it would be like to write, direct, and perform a show--all within 24 hours. Watch the movie and you'll find out. So well edited. It's a wonderful creative boost for anyone in the arts.",1364428800,2,278,4.673469387755102
8563576,5,B00B7C9CYK,"""One Night Stand"" is nail-biting, poignant and very funny--a depiction of the mysterious workings of the creative process and the gut-wrenching anxiety that comes with performing. The movie features some incredibly talented Broadway stars (Cheyenne Jackson, Mandy Gonzalez, Alicia Witt, Richard Kind, Rachel Dratch, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and many others) and gives you a glimpse into their process--what it's like to pull together a performance and make it look effortless, when in fact it is anything but. The movie is inspiring and totally captivating. I think it would be great to share with children, and anyone interested in the arts.",1364428800,2,638,5.39

8563578,5,B00B7C9CYK,"I think Variety said it right: ""Revealing the quasi-miraculous process of building scripts, songs and characters out of thin air...attractively lensed, dynamically edited.""  I recommend this film to anyone interested in seeing behind the scenes of Broadway!",1362009600,,257,5.945945945945946
