2551125,4,B000F4PD7G,"The movie titles over the ancient map with demons in the sea; the music of strings and drums sets the tone of otherworldlyness; tribal tales told round the campfire - and the dark beyond where terrors dwell.  Into this world of fable and myth we are told the tale of the hero Beowulf.  Is what we see and hear true - or along with other ancient stories, an entertainment to pass the time as we enjoy our drinks before sleep, as those ancient peoples did?

It has been over 60 years since I had to read Beowulf in Senior English.  All that I remember is it was a hero tale and I was glad to finish it.  But it did have a great hero.

I think the whole film is like a dream - not real, but fantasy.  We see Beowulf (Gerard Butler) emerging from the ice cold waters which would kill in minutes, to say G'day to a fisherman.  He is not cold - he is just wondering where he is.

In the opening moments we are introduced to the backstory of what happened to Grendel(Ingvar Sigurdsson), a troll, and why he is murdering the Danes.  The sea behind Grendel as this unfolds, with the huge ancient primeval rocks and the waves are awe inspiring, giving meaning to the quote ""what is man that you are mindful of him?""

Back in Geatland, Beowulf hears of the Danes troubles and decides to take his warriors to rid his friend, King Hrothgar(Stellan Skarsgard) of the menace.  The meeting with the king and the next days, show him to be a drunken weakling.  And there is something not right.

Selma (Sarah Polley), a witch, sees with clear eyes, maybe because she is considered ""the other"" a nonperson who would be killed except for the troll.  For some reason he protects her.  This is a secret, along with others, that Beowulf will begin to uncover, until he has become aware that all is not as it seems.  Is he doing good?  or evil?

The final denouement of Grendal is gruesome but the final honor paid by Beowulf to him is sad and dignified.

Comments:  Of the cast, Butler is perfect as the conflicted warrior, big, strong and questioning.

I was most dissapointed in Skarsgard.  After reading so many comments praising his performance maybe I expected more.  I thought he overdid some of his scenes and other lines just threw away.  He just did not make me feel anything for this wimpy king.

Sigurdsson was okay but again, I was expecting to feel more for him after reading soooo much praise for his performance.

Sarah Polley is the one I thought was spot on.  Now this is where I canna understand the dissing she has had over her Selma.  I GOT it and thought it was most telling that no one mentions the horror that her character must have endured by the time Beowulf meets her.  She asks him, when he mentions that both there peoples were annihilated by the same tribe, ""but did they make you a whore?""  I thought Polley played her as a survivor, and did it well.

The priest - was he supposed to be going mad?  That is the way I felt.

The Iceland horses - I loved watching the riders.  Did you notice that their gait makes the rider almost completely motionless?  No bouncing around.  The Tennessee Walker, that people ride  in the US who have to be riding all day, has the same gate.  The horse does the moving, the rider is still.  I thought the shot of all of the Geats riding towards the waterfall was great.  No laughing from me.

The language.  Come on!!!  This is so tame I hardly noticed it - I was expecting something like  ""GoodFellas"" with every other word a curseword.  Sorry, I was underwhelmed - seemed just about right for a bunch of men doing the dirty work of killing for the citizens.

Beowulfs comment on seeing the glacier ""We're in a different world here""  and his final words ""Sleep Grendel"" brought tears to my eyes.

A wonderful trip indeed into ""a different world.""  A myth - told round the campfire.  And the monsters are still out there in the dark.

2551127,5,B000F4PD7G,"Most students of English literature have been exposed to the Beowulf saga.  Can a modern movie picture preserve the original plot and please the lovers of the first assignment in English lit classes?  It deviates slightly from the original, but on the whole, it is a glorious, eye-pleasing drama that dances around some of the fanciful aspects of the story and focuses on the hero's dilemma of choice.  Does the troll, Grendel, deserve to be slaughtered by the hero, Beowulf?

This classic was filmed in Iceland.  Watching the scenic movie on DVD was a panoramic plasma-screen pleasure. But the best treat was a second viewing with the director's commentary.  Gerard Butler is a fine actor and plays heroic character who begins to doubt the righteousness of his killing the troll, Grundel with sensitive insight while he still preserves his warrior image.  Grendel (Ingvar Sigurdsson, an Icelander) grunts and groans with great gusto.  The Witch, Selma (Sarah Polley) is an outsider who combines sexiness and fierce independence. The other two women in the saga are the stylishly gowned Queen of the Danes and the water-witch mother of Grendel who is the scariest character in the movie.

But the actor that steals most scenes is the Swedish Stellar  Skarsgard who chews up his role as the drunken Danish King Hrothgar and spits it out with wondrous vitality  The costuming is properly primitive and the props are in keeping with the 11th Century.  I loved this film.",1153267200,10,1467,4.967213114754099

2551129,5,B000F4PD7G,"I'm uncertain why this film hasn't been released in the United

2551130,5,B000F4PD7G,"A film beyond any other film I have seen recently, it is a masterpiece of restraint, skill, authenticity, beauty and storytelling. It retells the most ancient text of the English language.

Beowulf and Grendel is not an adaptation but an interpretation of the original text. It is overflowing with beauty and a deep respect for the 1500-year old piece of skaldic poetry. Every image is a work of art and the screenplay respects the original epic, whilst allowing some artistic license.

Unlike the saga, it takes a neutral stance on the tale and demonstrates how a culture of violence and revenge is inevitably doomed.

Where this film differs greatly from the ""original"" is in its Christian content. Naturally, it is difficult to talk about Christian content in Beowulf since it is a pre-Christian text. The themes contained in the medieval text are of pagan origin: kinship, revenge, the acquisition of wealth, honour and death in battle, etc. As the roots of the tale developed in Scandinavia, the story switched to written form. Naturally only the clergy could write, so the story took on a Christian twist. The film wants nothing to do with this, looking through the dogma and deep into its true pagan roots.

It would of course be unfair to say that it is purely a pagan story line since there is clearly a Christian element to it, the Celtic missionary, but he simply serves to demonstrate the underhanded methods used by the early Church to convert the ""heathens"".

If I was to nitpick, I would say that it would have been interesting to have the film in Gamle Dansk. Passion of the Christ did this for Aramaic, it would have been feasible to do it here.

With this weak criticism, I exhort you all to watch this.",1148774400,26,1721,4.72

2551134,5,B000F4PD7G,"This film was shown three times at the Sarasota Film Festival although it was originally scheduled twice. It sold out so fast a special third screening was added due to popular demand. On Sunday April 9, 2006 I was fortunate enough to attend. Prior to the show, the Producer and Director were introduced who answered questions after the film. The most interesting questions and answers related to how the ideas and vision of this epic story were creatively conceived and made into reality within the setting of Iceland. It was a six year project from idea to finished product ... It was a huge hit at the Toronto Film Festival and was an equal smash at the Sarasota Film Festival. This film deserves wider distribution at theaters throughout the USA and internationally. It has all the qualities of a multimillion dollar multiple-award Oscar-winning film.

Gerard Butler is superbly cast as Beowulf, a hero and fighter from Greatland who comes to help the Danes fight a troll who has been wreaking havoc among them ... The King of the Danes provides a background of the troll's murderous activity but fails to tell the whole truth to Beowulf and his mighty warriors. The scenery in Iceland is breath-takingly beautiful - views of stark rocky mountains, steep icey cliffs, green hillsides and crashing waves against the shoreline. Although, the Danes were fierce fighters a certain fear had taken hold - they no longer trusted their own gods to support and protect them. They were fighting a troll who managed to elude their  fiercest efforts ... The Danes succumbed to baptism and the beliefs of the after life as taught by wandering Christian monks. Amazingly, even the Danish King was baptized after falling deeply into depression and alcoholism while watching some of his best men die. Perhaps the soul of the King was tortured by some dark untold secret? Along with the obvious good versus evil aspects of the story, there are unexpected gems of hilarious moments with respect to the literary license used in the dialogue and deeper hidden meaning of the plot and story line.

After Beowful met Selma the witch and had personally encountered the troll, he uncovered some bewildering aspects of the troll's character and behavior ... rather than seeing him as a wild animal, as described by the Danes, Beowulf noticed the troll carefully selected victims each of whom had harmed or threatened the troll. Beowulf and his warriors continue aiding the Danes but the battle lines are not drawn as straightly or clearly as before. The amazing curves and twists to the story line are very satisfying. The cinematography is outstanding. The battle and fight scenes are just as gruesome as required for the subject matter ... The most appealing aspect of this film is how the big bad monster is shown in a different light toward the end when the deeper hidden meaning of its behavior is better understood. While the film does deviate from the original adventurous epic poem, it has a universal appeal due to the engaging mannerisms of the characters and the gradual blossoming of the character of Grendel. The use of comedy helps balance the more gory gruesome scenes and their aftermath. Due to some adult content should not be viewed by anyone under age 18 without parental consent.

2551146,2,B000F4PD7G,"For a production that clearly put a lot of effort into historical details for clothing, buildings, even religion, so odd the story was left out.
I just read Beowulf so watching this film I was just dumbfounded by what the screenwriter did. Changing the backstory for Grendel wasn't a big deal, you can even lift that from the text, but the screenplay took out nearly all the cool stuff from the story and put in a bland retelling. Hrothgar comes off as a broken man. The fight with Grendel was different, even the way he was defeated was changed. And they felt compelled to throw in a love story. If the film had simply stuck to the story, kept the poetry and great speeches, the lessons told, this could have been a great film.

2551147,5,B000F4PD7G,"For those that fret over the 'revisionism' of this film, I fully understand as a historian. This is particularly true when the truth is reasonably well known about a particular historical period or event.

However, in as much as we're talking about a poem/saga with uncertain roots, presumably based on something that may have happened but certainly a variation of what's written, I'm satisfied with this particular interpretation on several levels as entertainment value. I especially liked the attention to dress detail reflecting the (pre-Viking) Vendel Period.

The acting was fine for me as was the cinematography, location, setting and etc. Even the use of Icelandic ponies was a nice touch. The only minor disappointment was Sarah Polley ... perhaps miscast, and bit of a before-her-time snarky libber, she could have done something with her accent to try and fit in with all the others.

2551170,4,B000F4PD7G,"Beowulf & Grendel (2005)

 Born in Reykjavik Iceland but raised in Vancouver Canada, director Sturla Gunnarsson has directed perhaps the most authentic to the period version of the ancient Beowulf story made to date.  In making the film he returned to his native Iceland as the best available locations for filming a tale from 4th century Denmark.  Beowulf has the distinction of being the earliest surviving English literature.  It existed in oral form for around 500 years before being written down.  The story tells of the famous hero, a Geat from Sweden, who comes to the aid of a Danish king who had troubles with the monstrous Grendel, a ferocious and very dangerous monster.  Oscar nominated Sturla Gunnarson does the tale justice while sticking closely to the temper and flavor of that period in Scandinavian history.
 Gerard Butler can depict a Norse hero in a convincing way.  His Beowulf has a more conflicted personality than the Beowulf of the poem.  He begins to think that his host, King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard) might have more to do with the creation of the Troll-like Grendel than at first glance seems correct.  But that does not stop him from dealing with the big guy in proper fashion.  It, and his relationship with a comely witch, make his character more interesting and complex.  The Gerard Butler Beowulf is not simply a super hero in antique clothing.
 The rest of the cast are actors not familiar to most American movie goers.
 One of the characters is an Irish Monk, come to Denmark to gather heathen souls for Christ.  This gives writer Andrew Rai Berzins a chance to put into his character's mouths one of many lines that I at least thought both wise and clever.  After an encounter with the monk King Hrothgar asks
 You ever worry about that? Heaven
 Beowulf replies I'm thinking I'll likely go where I'm sent.

 This film made no impact at the box office what so ever, a few thousand dollars in ticket sales world wide and that is a dirty shame.  Beowul and Grendel is a strong three and a half saw blade movie.  The photography truly captures the gritty reality of the life at the time.  The sets, clothing and armor all seem to be well researched and proper.  Butler shows Beowulf as a man of complexity and depth who never the less can do believable battle with Grendel when the time comes.
 At one hour and 43 minutes long, the film carries a strong R rating for sex, lots of bloody fighting and tons of very bad language.  Barbarians, what can you say?
 If you value historical films for their determined attempts to stay true to the era, put this one on your list.",1431216000,,2606,4.643326039387309

2551175,4,B000F4PD7G,"Released in 2005, ""Beowulf & Grendel"" tells the basic story of the epic poem: Beowulf (Gerard Butler), a hero of the Geats (modern-day Sweden), comes to the aid of Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgrd), the king of the Danes (modern-day Denmark), whose great hall is terrorized by the monster Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigursson). In the poem Beowulf fights Grendel with his bare hands and, in the second act, he takes on Grendel's sea hag mother (Elva sk lafsdttir) with a magical sword he finds in her lair.

The third act of the poem takes place fifty years after these events when Beowulf is king of the Geats wherein he takes on a fire-breathing dragon, which is entirely omitted in the film.

The first two acts are, of course, re-imagined for the film. Grendel is no longer an evil monster, but rather a Neanderthalic lug who lives by himself in the wilderness, which the director described as a ""Sasquatch,"" but - don't worry - he looks nothing like a conventional Bigfoot. He looks just as described: A mentally-challenged Neanderthalic lug. The movie wisely adds the character of a seer outcast, Selma, played by Sarah Polley. I've heard people complain about her performance, but I regard her as a highlight.

The fact that the movie is called ""Beowulf & Grendel"" signifies that Grendel is probably going to be a more sympathetic character than in the poem, and he is. The motive for his slaughter of the Danes isn't due to the agonizing sounds of celebration, as in the poem, but rather primal vengeance. Despite Grendel's lack of sophistication there's ethicality to his killings. For instance, he refuses to slay Hrothgar and also refuses, at first, to harm the Geats. The story reveals why. As for Beowulf, he isn't depicted as a one-dimensional; he plays the detective who starts to see that there's more going on than meets the eye.

The movie plays like a fairly realistic Viking tale, but the inclusion of the sea hag puts it in the realm of fantasy. What the heck is a ""sea hag"" anyway? In any event, this is an excellent live-action companion-piece to 2007's animated ""Beowulf,"" which was much more popular at the box office (""Beowulf & Grendel"" bombed, but - then again - it was barely released). The percussion-oriented score is great and the Icelandic locations are magnificent. While the plot is simple, there's a lot more going on underneath the surface. For details see Callmomrad's incredibly well-written and erudite review on IMDb. My lone criticism is that you can only make out about half the dialogue due to the heavy accents and muffled deliveries, which wouldn't be a problem if the DVD had a subtitle option, but it doesn't; so you'll have to listen closely.

The film runs 103 minutes.

The dialog is stilted and feels unnatural. The makeup effects for Grindle are laughable, clunky and unbelievable. Pretty much a failure of interpreting the excitement of a legend that has been told for over a millennia. J.R.R. Tolkien studied this story his entire career because it is that full of excitement, meaning and symbolism. This movie is not worth the money even if it's free! This movie is so bad, you should probably just watch your blank TV screen for 2 hours instead. It will be so much more interesting.

I saw this film a few years back but never actually picked it up. Now, and of course, Vikings series on History Channel partly to blame, I've been on a mission to watch as many Norse-inspired films as possible.
There aren't that many good ones I'm afraid. There's the Kirk Douglas classic 'The Vikings', the almost passable '13th Warrior' and Pathfinder; which I actually quite enjoy. Then there's Beowulf & Grendel. Let me tell you, this film works! It has breathtaking locations (Iceland), quality acting by all but one or two actors (which is not bad
considering there are quite a few), a well placed score and well paced dramatic story arch. This film is easily worthy of better scores than given on IMDB or Metacritic. My one gripe with the film would be that the end sort of works itself out and never really reaches any type of climax or cathartic moment. Even as the tension within the
story arch swells. I wasn't expecting explosions or sinister plot twists or anything like that. Just a little more 'oomph'. But that's really a minor gripe because the rest of the film is so well done that it won't matter much to you once you reach the final destination and find yourself on the last reel.

So, if you like period pieces that have authentic sets and wardrobes, mixed in with elements of the oldest piece of fantasy hero literature recorded. You will enjoy this little, under appreciated gem.

2551200,3,B000F4PD7G,"Hate to sound like a snob but I love the original epic poem of Beowulf so very much that I guess I'm extra hard to please when others who love it, too, try to put the story on film.  Ingvarsson's vision is interesting---Grendel is discriminating in his murdering frenzy, which humanizes the fiend, so fits within the context that King Hrothgar murdered his fiendish father but spares him when he was a lad...but to me, seems a tiny bit off.

In this particular case, the special features are the best aspect---hearing about the vision and story arch, watching the creators compete with the weather in Iceland to make the film...  Really quite interesting.

The retelling stays only with the first half of the story---the hero Beowulf (who of course ""err's"" with the same kindness Hrothgar in the end).  There is an added character here too, who in terms of this interpretation of the story is very interesting and I liked her---won't give that part away.  But I'm always troubled how filmmakers strip King Hrothgar of everything, dignity and wisdom as well.  Hrothgar is at the end of his life---but it was a noble life, he was a Great Goldgiving King who left a great legacy of community in building Heorot.  Then the demon fiend threatens to take all that away, yes.  But Hrothgar isn't pitiful, and in the original there is no hint that i can find (having studied it scholarly for over 20 years) that even suggests Hrothgar is to blame or has any filial connection with Grendel.  And Hrothgar, though weakened by age and too many battles, still has a wealth of wisdom to pass on to Beowulf.  In fact his only ""weakness"" is seen through Wealtheow, his Queen, who is concerned that Hrothgar has grown so fond of Beowulf as a kind of son to him that he might neglect his own two sons when it comes to leaving them his kingdom.  Read the poem---it is work, perhaps, because it is unfamiliar in our current culture---but it is worth it.

So if you're looking for a fun epic hero story from the Nordic area with harsh weather conditions and viking heroics, you'll enjoy the film.  But if you're looking for a true adaptation of the great epic Poem in full, devoted to the glory as well as the tragedy of Beowulf's story (hero in Denmark, yes, but failed king in Geatland because he didn't take Hrothgar's wisdom to heart), the film will leave you hungry.

2551202,3,B000F4PD7G,"""Beowulf and Grendel"" is a mediocre medieval action film loosely adopted from the classic Anglo Saxon poem ""Beowulf."" The movie takes too long to introduce the lead character. Ingvar E. Sigurdsson plays Grendel as a savage man full of grunts and not easily understood. The special effects used for Grendel's mother are not very special. Sarah Polley plays Selma, a witch added to the poem who does not fit in with the setting or other characters, to give Beowulf a romantic interest but only comes off as a too modern voice whose North American accent really does not fit in with the rest of the cast who generally are from Europe. There are hosts of forgettable warriors accompanying Beowulf. The ending is oddly anticlimatic.

By all rights this film should have been a disaster. Strangely it wasn't--and most of the credit for that goes to Gerard Butler in the lead role. Butler carries this movie and Stellan Skarsgrd is a solid supporting actor as Hrothgar. While she does not appear much in the film (though her role is expanded in some of the deleted scenes), Steinunn lna Porsteinsdttir does a credible job as Wealtheow. The film was shot in Iceland and it shows. The landscapes are spectacular. While certainly not a good film, ""Beowulf and Grendel"" escapes being a bad film due to strong performances, interesting action scenes and the visuals. It's certainly worth a view for fans of medieval fantasy and action films.

The DVD offered some deleted scenes that did little to add to the movie besides fleshing out Hrothgar and Wealtheow. There is a trailer showing a few scenes from ""Wrath of Gods,"" a documentary on the making of ""Beowulf and Grendel."" I usually don't find those types of documentaries interesting but I did find the scenes included in this DVD to be more intriguing than some of the actual film.",1360713600,,1824,4.805732484076433

2551214,5,B000F4PD7G,"Wow! Where to start.  I LOVED this movie! Forget the critical reviews.  Keep in mind that the poem Beowulf is just that, a poem. It is not a story, but it hints at the story behind the poem.  And those who appreciate the beauty of the poem, yearn for the story.  This movie proposes what that story might have been, and it feels very authentic.  It is a wonderful weaving of the Beowulf poem, Viking history, and Scandinvaian folklore.  AND it is filmed in Iceland - the scenery will take your breath away. Let the movie take you away.  A few points to help you enjoy the movie:

1) There are Vikings in the movie. So they have potty-mouths, are dirty, hairy, and probably smelly. And yes, the oft repeated four letter words are also VERY old germanic words.  So, the use of the language is relevant to the movie.

2) The troll:  Um, he's a troll.  His vocabulary is a little limited.  That's because he's a troll.  Trolls are very central to Scandinavian folklore.  The sea-hag is another kind of troll.  They aren't the prettiest of beings, but they also aren't all bad. Keep an open mind.

3) If you watch the movie and are a little confused in places or on the fence about whether or not you like the movie, watch it again with the director's commentary.  Then, watch it again without the director's commentary. At this point, you will love the movie.  Then you can order Wrath of the Gods, which is the behind the scenes movie for this movie.  Equally as good.

Iceland: is beautiful and unforgiving.  The cast and crew worked very hard to bring us this movie.  I feel badly for them that the critics got it so wrong on this one.  It is a GREAT movie!!",1347926400,,1657,4.375

Here is a more sympathetic & human retelling of the Beowulf & Grendel story, actually a poem, written between the 8th & 11th century.

Here Beowulf is a more kind & understanding protagonist. Grendel is a wronged antagonist, who looks very much human, but is a mutant or abomination in the eyes of humanity. Both are played as sympathetic characters. Gerard Butler does a fine job as Beowulf, as he plays his part as a multi dimensional personality, not just a one dimensional blood, fame & power lusting hero.

Stellan Skarsgard, who looks remarkably like Geoffrey Rush in all that orange hair, does a fine job as the King, who has a secret to hide from Beowulf about Grendel, & only at the end is his hand forced & his humanity at stake for what he has done.

A thoughtful, sincere retelling, ""Beowulf & Grendel"" is highly recommended!",1327795200,,856,4.6118421052631575
2551217,4,B000F4PD7G,"This is a fictional interpretation of the great myth of the heroic battle between Beowulf and Grendel.  It is not a faithful film version of the famous poem, but an attempt to portray what may have really happened.  To be honest, it either clicks for you or it doesn't.  In my opinion, the story works, is plausible, and is supported by very good acting for the most part.  Subjectively speaking, I liked it.

The story takes place in the thickest of the dark ages, when order in the western Roman Empire has completely collapsed, about 7C CE.  In the prologue, a band of Danish warriors encounter and kill a mysterious human-like creature playing with a hairy and ugly child.  They could be surviving protohumans, mutants, or indeed monsters.  The savage child is allowed to live by the King and emerges as an adult to seek violent retribution.  Meanwhile, the hero of a neighboring tribe, Beowulf, decides to take on the task of saving his old benefactors, who had raised him as an orphan.

In this version, Beowulf is not a superhuman but an intelligent and compassionate man, who wants to understand his adversary, who is called a troll.  He is modern thinking without being an anachronism, which is something very hard to carry off.  He is helped by a tough witch (Polley), who knows the creature; she is the most weakly acted character, imho, but then I have never been impressed with her acting.  The spirit of the once-valiant and generous king is broken, lost in alcoholism and despair, in a wonderful performance.  Needless to say, what Beowulf discovers is unexpected, but he feels compelled to carry out his duty, particularly against Grendel's shreakingly inhuman mother.  The creature himself is also a complex character, for whom the viewer can feel a mix of revulsion and sympathy.  Meanwhile, a priest is converting the pagan crew to Jesus, which is rather comically parodied.

This film adds a really nice twist to the myth.  Recommended.",1325462400,,1956,4.840361445783133

2551222,5,B000F4PD7G,"First; the criticism: this is a deeply revisionist retelling of the Beowulf saga. Portraying the monster as a misunderstood bunny rabbit to make some kind of moral relativist point is an offensively ridiculous trope which should have disappeared from history along with bell bottom pantaloons, and it should rightfully be laughed to cinders. The crypto-feminist ""love story"" subplot with the witch is as ridiculous and disgusting as most modern ones are in the actual world. It's also fairly slow paced and dull, unless watched with attention to detail.

Now, why you should watch this movie. First: it is beautifully filmed. It doesn't have any preposterous CGI special effects; it's just overpoweringly beautiful. The symbolism and foreshadowing are also subtly powerful and very well done.

The characterization is strong and realistic. Compare it to, say, 13th warrior. The characterization in that film is like wooden quasi-superheroes. The men in this movie act like men; men who work and fight together. Not like effete cube dwelling gerbils (like in 2007's animated Grendel atrocity); these guys behave like actual men. The types who fight in wars, wear hard hats and get into barfights. You think Vikings acted like pieces of wood, or cube gerbils? I think they acted more like dudes in motorcycle gangs, hunting parties and construction crews. I know what such men are like, because I used to be one of them; that's what manly comradery is like. This is an honest portrayal of how men follow their leaders, are unique characters in a team and the way they interact with each other and give each other a hard time. This is so incredibly rare in modern cinema, it's worth watching for that alone. Generally filmmakers are the types who actively hate the working classes or anything resembling manhood. The characterization here is so strong, it's almost mythical. I've worked and gotten drunk with guys like this. They're real, and unlike cube-hamsters (who were probably all castrati in Byzantium in those days), they probably existed among Geatish warriors 1500 years ago.

Another intensely clever bit: the use of both raw and poetic language. Men talk like that today. Real people don't go 'round declaiming things in crypto-formal language, unless they have some kind of tradition of speaking like motion picture Indians. Most ""viking"" movies have preposterous dialog like this, where nobody ever uses naughty words, or where everything is ribald and ridiculous. Other critics complained about the salty language. Such people are probably perpetually offended. Go watch Dumbo and be happy, or complain about Dumbo's theme of cruelty to animals if that makes you happy.

Yet another bit of cleverness: the mix of accents. I was confused at first, and then I thought about my study of Anglo-Saxon and Nordic languages. That's what things were like! People, even people in the same tribe, would have had vastly different accents. They still do today in places like Norway, where you can speak perfect Norwegian, drive 40 miles, and hardly understand a thing that is said. This makes about 1000 times more sense than the fakeo ""accents"" in other period movies. Clever!

Even more cleverness: the monsters were Neanderthals. Some people seemed to think they were supposed to be victims of Downs syndrome or something. No, they were very obviously Neanderthals. I find that more clever than Chrichton's cleverness in 13th Warrior. It also makes the story *make perfect sense.* If Neanderthals (who were incredibly strong compared to regular humans, and similarly not so gifted with speech abilities) managed to survive into relatively modern times, that's what the interaction would be like. In fact, we pretty much know from anthropological digs, that's what it *was* like for the tens of thousands of years that Neanderthals and modern European men interacted with each other. Very clever indeed; clever enough to make up for the revisionism, which makes perfect sense in this context. Don't believe me? Go look at the wikipedia entry for neanderthal anatomy: you will see several characters from this film.

I also enjoyed the interplay of the old religion with Christianity. I rather suspect similar marketing was used in the early spread of Christianity, when it wasn't nuts like old King Olaf pouring molten metal down pagan people's guts.

Finally, just like the old Sagas (even in Beowulf); this movie is *funny.* Norse mythology is supposed to be funny; these were people who made good jokes and laughed at fate. When crazy things happen in your life, it is often funny in the exact same way as in this movie. They even used clever alliteration in their jokes, which is precisely what the Skalds did in the sagas. The poetic form used in these old Nordic languages was alliterative! For that matter, alliteration and authentic dark age kennings are used everywhere in this film. I've *never* heard that in any other film, period. The scriptwriter is hereby exonerated from all his other sins. This script is a work of actual genius.

The set designers and artificers on this film were also very well informed. From the swords and armor, right down to the drinking implements (I think King Hygelac's glass beaker is something taken from the Sutton Hoo burial site).

I think more people would appreciate this if they were exposed to Anglo Saxon in high school, the way my mom and dad were. I guess I don't blame the people complaining about the revisionism, but do give it another try with some of these things in mind.",1304726400,9,5534,5.032751091703057

Another costume turkey flung upon an unsuspecting and utterly disinterested world in the wake of The Lord of the Rings' success, Beowulf and Grendel is a curious beast and a far less interesting spin on the original than either Outlander or the undervalued The 13th Warrior. On one level it wants to be a revisionist `reimagining' of the epic poem, yet the budget seems to run out on a daily basis leaving sequences an odd mixture of impressively shot footage and scenes almost inept enough to be from a Robbie Moffat fillum, as if it was made by a director with a half-thought out vision he didn't have the ability to bring properly to the screen. If anything it feels like it was made by two completely different directors at extreme opposite ends of the skills scale with two completely different visions (not beyond the realms of possibility in a film boasting 14 credited producers), the casting a similarly odd mixture of good actors who should know better (Stellan Skarsgard, Sarah Polley, Eddie Marsan) roped in by what seems like a bunch of blokes from a Scottish rugby team who pooled together their bonuses to make a film for a lark, one of whom is taking it way too seriously and overacting in the genuine belief that this is his starmaking role (step forward Gerard Butler, the man who would be Connery but just comes across like a young Shouty Shouty Brian Blessed).

It doesn't help that far from a monstrous incarnation of all the evils plaguing man and society that must be destroyed, this Grendel goes from laughably bearded infant to what looks like a Glaswegian cage-fighter and is now the true victim of the tale, in the process diminishing Beowulf's heroism and making him part of the problem rather than the solution. Worse, despite a good feel for the genuinely stunning landscapes, it all too often comes down to a fight over a hut where Beowulf really doesn't do much anyway.

If this were an essay on the poem it would get an easy F for its almost complete inability to understand what the source material is about, but changing the substance of the original to its polar opposite - pagan religion good, Christianity a bit of a giggle, Grendel the oppressed minority, Beowulf discovering his inner New Man and the odd bit of political correct guilt tripping thrown in for bad measure - is the least of its sins. It's not the easiest of epic poems to read in any translation, let alone adapt, so changes are the price of a screen adaptation. The trouble is they're so odd and often absurd, more unintentional comedy than magical realism, the sort of mixture of off the wall philosophising and pulp plotting Ed Wood might have turned out if he'd had a bigger budget and a decent second unit cameraman.

The f-ing and blinding interlaced with 50s-style heroic direlogue is increasingly comic. There are odd non-sequiters, like the hand that reaches out of a fjord to grab at Beowulf which goes completely uncommented on, or Eddie Marsan's Oirish priest suddenly foaming at the mouth and falling over for no apparent reason as if the last page of the scene never turned up and they had to do something, anything to end it. And then there's the bizarre clash of accents, albeit on broadly tribal grounds (Scots for the Geats, Scandanavian for the Danes). It seems a bit unfair to single out Sarah Polley for her undisguised Canadian accent if she wasn't just so out of place in the whole thing as the whore-turned-witch. Giving her dialogue like ""No thought of my ****, then?"" only aggravates matters long before it turns out she had a one-night stand with Grendel and has a little monster of her own.

Sometimes the humor is dry and sly enough to pass but at times it's positively Monty Pythonic: you keep on waiting for Philip Whitchurch's deeply unimpressed fisherman to start talking about strange women lying in ponds distributing swords being no basis for a system of government or thinking that Skarsgard and Marsan have been possessed by Graham Chapman and Terry Jones when the subject of Christianity is raised - ""Christ, eh? Heard of him. He ever have much luck with trolls?"" ""Oi'm ov da fort dat dey nivva crossed parffs.""

Ending on a would-be post-modern note with one character dismissing the evolving `bastardized' poem as excrement, the claim might have carried more weight if this film wasn't simply a runnier version of the same.",1301270400,2,4579,4.696139476961394
2551234,4,B000F4PD7G,"I anticipated this movie before it was released because I had read some of the background on the concepts used by the director & the screen writer and found them intriguing. It was released but not to wide distribution because it got overwhelmed by the Big Studio oohhh-gosh animated version featuring Angelina Jolie's voice & likeness cast on her animated Grendel mother with scaly tail & pneumatic bosom. I've now seen both versions, this one twice. And I like this one just fine... it's a movie that tells a well-known story in a different way. However, this movie only focuses on the conflict between Beowulf, Grendel, & his mother (all of which occur in the first half of the epic). It doesn't carry on to Beowulf becoming a king who rules for decades & goes off to slay a dragon in the end.
So for all the critics who are whining about this movie doesn't follow the original epic poem written in Old English around 1000 CE about mythical events taking place in a foreign land 300 years earlier - let's get one thing straight. It has long been established by scholars of the original epic that the ORIGINAL story doesn't have a whole lot of continuity or unity or even make sense EITHER folks. It seems to vacillate between being a traditional Nordic-Germanic hero tale of super-man VS. super-monster, but then there's a bunch of discordant pseudo-Christian elements thrown in (likely due to the influence of that increasingly popular religion) and a variety of other inconsistencies that do make it somewhat disjointed. So are the critics suggesting that the film makers should have made their movie equally confusing? Or perhaps, like most adaptations of ancient writings (how about Shakespeare?) we allow them to take artistic license & attempt to explain the story in a new & perhaps more meaningful way to a modern audience?
And let's not forget that the epic poem, although it's the 'oldest written work in English', was virtually unknown & ignored until the mid-1800's.
Thus I think it was worth the attempt for the film makers to re-create the 'myth' in a more reasonable & realistic manner... with a hero whose larger-than-life reputation for battle-glory is the subject of sarcasm by his crew (how refreshing that was). And a sympathetic 'monster'... did you scream ""Foul!""when Van Helsing's Frankenstein monster was more benign than the original too, even poignantly self-aware?
And yes, there's a woman in the movie who never appears in the epic... how awful that they'd break from the macho tradition of male-bonding action adventure to throw in a woman & some complicated side-story... but that's modern movies (and society, if you want to be realistic).
For those who seemed confused by the presentation of Grendel, THIS Grendel monster was clearly intended to be a surviving remnant of a co-habiting hominid such as Australopithecus... that was the script writers stated goal. There's NO magic, no mysticism, no supernatural demonic forces... just Nature. An interesting idea when we realize fossils such as the ""Hobbit"" people of Indonesia (Bali?) discovered a few years ago who definitely co-existed with modern humans.
Also, Hrothgar was a man in despair... taken to drink to drown his guilt over his inability to protect his village as a good chieftain must.
The epileptic, zealous Irish Christian priest was a treat for me... some excellent dialog betwixt him & Hrothgar. Perhaps this was a nod to the inconsistent Christian themes of the original.
As I recall, Grendel is only killing the warriors who hunted down his father years before (primitive hominids matured much faster than do modern humans, by age 12-15) that he appears able to identify by scent. So I'd have to disagree w/ all those who say he's killing 'everyone' in the village - I recall that differently.
And I have to admit, I'm extremely fond of the angle taken where one of Beowulf's crew is presented a bard who is composing verses that we can assume eventually become the epic poem... especially the witty lines about ""Grendel, with the mark of Cain... we're all killers?""

2551238,4,B000F4PD7G,"Oh good an epic Viking saga movie.  This is one of those.  ""Beowulf & Grendel"" however is based upon the Anglo-Saxon literary piece ""Beowulf"" and the battle that transpires between them.  King Hrothgar leaves some of the story out and Beowulf has to figure out some of the details on his own.
IMHO, ""The 13th Warrior"" is a little better.  ""How To Train Your Dragon"" (animated) is almost on par with this movie, ""Beowulf & Grendel"" although this movie has Danish people instead of Scottish or Irish in the character roles.  This movie (B&G) also talks about Valhalla and Odin enough to pique your interest, and gives the viewer a good idea of what a Viking castle more than likely was, instead of the stone walls and fortresses we sometimes romantically visualize as associated with Vikings.  The undertone of the story is that sometimes what we perceive as evil isn't always without justification, and that more effort to understand and empathize with our enemy makes us more respectable.  I disagree on both counts, but felt the movie had merit for authenticity, costumes, sets, and portrayal of brotherhood among warriors.  It is a classic tale that needs to be shared, and this movie does that well.  I didn't look very hard for reasons not to like ""Beowulf & Grendel"" because I wanted to learn about the folklore tale.  I think there is a lot of toned down civilized ethics in this movie that doesn't fit though.  My idea of Vikings is more of a brutal warrior with nearly zero conscience against any enemies of the Norse people.
There is a 1958 movie called ""The Vikings"" with Janet Leigh, Ernest Borgnine, Kirk Douglas, and Tony Curtis that has been hailed as one of the best portrayals of Norse saga folklore.
In 1964, ""The Long Ships"" starred Sidney Poitier, Richard Widmark, Rosanna Schiaffino, Clifford Evans, Oskar Homolka, Edward Judd, Beba Loncar, and Russ Tamblyn and is a tale of searching for a bell made of solid gold; purportedly among the top ten best Viking movies ever made.
In 1978, ""The Norseman"" came out with Lee Majors, ex-L.A. Ram David ""Deacon"" Jones, Jack Elam, Cornel Wilde, Susie Coelho, that some have said ended up unintentionally being more of a comedy because of  some of the sets, costumes, and script.
In 1974, Walt Disney released, ""The Island At The Top Of The World"" which is a book based film set in 1907 where an airship adventure into the Arctic discovers a lost band of Vikings.  TIATTOTW is supported by a cast that includes Donald Sinden, David Hartman, Jacques Marin, Mako, David Gwillim Agneta Eckemyr, and Gunnar Ohlund.
In 1961, ""Erik The Conqueror"" came out starring Cameron Mitchell, Alice Kessler, Ellen Kessler, George Ardisson, Raf Baldassarre, and others; mostly themed as focusing around a war between the Vikings and Britain.
I've seen ""The 13th Warrior,"" ""How To Train Your Dragon,"" and ""Beowulf & Grendel"" many times (I own a DVD of them), and of all the others I HAVEN'T seen, I'm guessing ""Erik The Conqueror"" appears particularly worthy of my time as well.
But I digressed a little bit.  ""Beowulf & Grendel"" is worth owning if you're a Viking saga fan.  If you want the epic Viking saga that more or less defines all the rest before or since, it is probably the 1958 ""The Vikings"" film with Kirk Douglas.  ""Beowulf & Grendel"" is still a great Viking film for your collection though.  Oh and BTW, the actor (Gerard Butler) portraying Beowulf is also the voice for the dad Viking in the animated ""How To Train Your Dragon.""  ""Beowulf & Grendel"" would have got 5 stars from me if the moment shared between Selma and Grendel would have included a little more ""R"" rated material.",1289088000,3,3637,4.75516693163752

2551242,5,B000F4PD7G,"On the whole, I am greatly pleased by ""Beowulf & Grendel"".  The movie is performed from the point of view of one living in the time of Beowulf (~A.D.480).  Life was hard, short and brutish.  In the struggle for survival, people then were generally hostile toward others different from themselves.  This intolerance sets the stage for murder, vengeance, and ultimately compassionate respect.

I liked this movie because it turns the heroic fantasy, a classic of English literature, into a more believable and useful morality tale.  As such, it provides something closer to what might have actually happened than what the original legend evolved into.

I give the movie five stars and would defend it against some criticisms:

- dialog littered with expletives: Gee, I really can't imagine anyone used to bloodshed and death to refrain from such colorful speech.
- unattractive people: Sorry, people of the fifth century are not well known for their insistence on grooming and personal hygiene.
- movie was boring (compared to 2007 w/ Angelina Jolie) - well, you can have blood above your shoulders, or below your navel, but not at the same time.  Pick one.",1275350400,,1155,5.005235602094241
2551243,3,B000F4PD7G,"There's something to be said for making a movie by placing real actors and real objects in front of a real camera with real film loaded in it. In this respect, ""Beowulf and Grendel"" easily exceeds Robert Zemeckis's largely CGI ""Beowulf"". If nothing else, Hrothgar is a believable Danish ruler, rather than a vinyl Stinky Pete, sans pickaxe.

The script -- which has a great deal of intentional humor -- never forgets that ""Beowulf"" is an Anglo-Saxon tale, and peppers the dialog with F-bombs and S-bombs -- not to mention the C word. Selma (a character not in the original tale) asks Beowulf why he hasn't made a snatch for her c---. Despite this, there is almost no sex -- the principal sex scene being Grendel ravishing Selma. (Yes.)

Which brings us to the ""reworking"" of the original tale. The Zemeckis version is tolerably close, but ""B&G"" strays far afield, with Grendel now the revenging victim of the Danes' violence. Still, as silly as it all is, the overall /effect/ is not half so silly as the Zemeckis film, which is why I've given it 3 stars. The Blu-ray transfer is beautiful, and allows one to savor the magnificent cinematography. Not to mention the bearded, long-haired eye-candy. Beowoof!

Performances are generally okay, with the notable exception of Sarah Polley. She was a wonderful child actress (""Baron Munchausen""), but her ""performance"" here is wooden and amateurish beyond belief (and beneath contempt) -- it wouldn't be acceptable in a high-school play.

Now that Gerard Butler has played the king of Sparta, Atilla, and Beowulf, perhaps it's time he assayed Gilgamesh. One problem, though -- Gilgamesh and Enkidu start off as woman lovers, but when they meet each other... well <ahem>. It's hard to figure how ""The Epic of Gilgamesh"" could be ""reimagined"" to cover up /that/.

As the title indicates, Grendel is more central in this version. He is more than a one dimesional monster. He is a chracter with thoughts, and feelings, and motivations for his actions. I like this idea. I also particualary enjoyed some of the religiouse commentary that was added. I thought it was a great way to adress the fact that while Beowulf is has a Heathen Norse setting, the text that we have was obviously written down by a Christian (or possibly several), who put his religious slant on all the characters and events.

2551253,4,B000F4PD7G,"The scenery is flabbergasting and awe-inspiring. Beautiful mountains and fjords, vertiginous seascape and landscape, little winter and snow. It is not a film about the cold north but the heroic pagan mystery of this northern climes. Pagan with some beings coming from we do not know where, though the troll is explained very clearly from the very start as being the son of a man who was killed in some atrocious way by some Danes, just because he was coming from somewhere else and he ""stole"" a fish. The son then escapes and survives in nature alone. He becomes a wild child that does not speak any human language and is only looking for his vengeance on the Danish chief who had his father killed and who spared the child's life out of some human feeling. Beowulf is the one who is going to get that ""troll"", and the story is very close to the English Beowulf, though they try once again to make things look natural, normal. It kills in many ways the meaning and the power of some symbols, and you will never know that Beowulf used a sword from the giants who were on earth before human beings, and that this sword is decorated with runes and interlacing runic tangles. The fact that he has to resort to this sword he finds in the hoard of the mother of this Grendel, some kind of unexplained amphibious monster, appears to be a simple accident, while it is an essential and meaningful element: these monsters are the descendants of the giants that dominated the world before human beings. Some future is told by a witch but she uses bones instead of using the famous runes. The most important addition to this film, as compared to the original story, is this witch who was more or less raped once by Grendel and who got a son from him. Does this element give any humanity to the tale? I do not think so. Does it emphasizes the pagan side of the tale? Maybe but we have to say the repetitive christenings are at least counterbalancing this pagan element. The last interesting side of the film is the realistic rendition of the habitat of these northern human beings and that is neither comfortable, nor in anyway clean or well-ordered. It sure is the story of humanity emerging out of old phases of animal or pre-human existence, but this emergence is identified too much with the Christianization of Scandinavia. In one word is a good film of action though it is rather nave as for the real anthropological or even archeological dimension  of the story, and it is rather too far from the Anglo-Saxon poem to be considered as a fair adaptation of the first part of this poem. We are missing the dragon of the second part and the death of the hero.

Let's pause a moment and mention Iceland. This film was shot in Iceland and every single frame is bursting with absolutely glorious scenery. The Icelandic Tourist Board is writhing on the floor like so many of Hrothgar's drunken Danes with glee over this film.

Alas, they are probably the only folks. The initially promising moments in the film are good, as we see the troll's dad being pursued by Danes and battling with them (but not much battling). But from there things begin to fall apart. A lot of sword wielding guys in bad long hair, then it's time to stare at the beautiful Icelandic scenery, then let's all go to sleep and get killed in a gloriously uncinematic fashion.

Additionally, oral poems tend to feature flat but mythic characters (the strong Beowulf or the clever Odysseus) rather than rounded human characters we can relate to.  For this reason and no other, most Beowulf movies stink.

Not so with this one.  The movie adopts a standard superhero-type formula which is to make Grendel the sympathetic character gone bad, and use this to create an altogether human story full of moral questions relating to the value of mercy, justice, and other profound questions.  The story is thus immensely satisfying on a deep level.

Additionally, the cinematography is well done and the Icelandic landscape beautifully shot.

2551267,1,B000F4PD7G,"I love Gerard Butler in 300 and thought Attila was ok.  This movie is absolutely horrible.  First let's define the characters.  The troll and his dad are best described as Neanderthal men with lots of body hair and apparently large plastic deltoids (shoulder muscles) that look incredibly fake.  The movie starts with the Neanderthal men howling and babbling like deranged infants and believe me you will have plenty of opportunity to listen to this jibber jabber come from the Troll (only the country whore Selma seems somehow be able to translate this Neanderthal language).  Then the Danes and their king easily kill Grendel's father when Grendel himself was just a wee little Neanderthal boy with white hair all over his face.  Grendel is pissed and later is able to kill hundreds of Danes quite easily (but if you are looking for action don't as there is NO real fight scenes in this movie you just see the after shot).  Why on earth is Grendel such a power house when his Dad was able to easily be killed in his prime?  Your right it does not make any sense but if it did it would not belong in this movie.
  Back to Selma.  Anyway she is a ""witch"" and a self describe ""whore"" who Beowulf seems to kind of fall in love with but not really but who cares?  Her hair is best described as the fashion one would see after someone had been living underground and washing their hair with worm guts for ten years and despite the fact that it rains everyday her hair magically says dry and dirty for the film.  If that isn't a reason enough for Beowulf to fall for her (besides the fact she is a whore) then there is the fact that the Troll also comes a knockin' as he has taken quite a fancy to the little witch.
Anyway the meandering story looks as if you are finally going to see some action when the Troll comes to attack the Danes and Beowulf (he apparently has a big conscious and would not attack Beowulf and his men until they urinated on his house/cave entrance and smashed his Dad's shrunken skull {which was the decoration for Grendel's cave}.  But instead of action you see the Troll instantly kill Beowulf's men with one blow but no way can he with Beowulf, no he just hits him a few times and then looks at him longingly as Beowulf ties a rope on his hand??? What the heck?  Then the Troll jumps off the roof and is hanging there.  He is apparently too tired or weak to reach up and cut the rope from his hand that Beowulf tied so he does what anyone would . . . cut off his whole arm????  WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?  This guy is monster strong and he makes one weak attempt to reach up and cut the rope then says ah who cares I have another arm let me just go ahead and resect this whole arm, not at the wrist mind you the shoulder which make perfect sense-NOT.  Also the soldiers were apparently dancing and drinking or something because no archer comes to shoot him hanging there, they only show up after he is running away into the night.

2551268,1,B000F4PD7G,"This was seriously one of the worst films I've seen, and I've seen ""The Curse"" with Wil Wheaton.  There is no continuity with accents, character, and least of all the story of Beowulf.  The only thing this movie has in common with the poem is that there is some guy named Beowulf and some guy named Grendel.  Grendel is not at all meant to be a sympathetic character.  He is a _monster_, not just a big man.  There is no mention of Odin or Valhalla in the poem.  There are absolutely NO sexual themes in the poem, something from which many a modern storyline could learn.  These themes do not make a story better, and it is quite clear that they forced this down our throats with the addition of an entirely new character just to be some kind of horrible, awkward ""love"" interest.

The poem aside and taking this as an independent story, it's awful.  It's four-monkeys-at-one-typewriter awful.  It's almost ""Galaxy of the Dinosaurs"" awful.  And if the story wasn't bad enough already, they decided to throw in the F-bomb a few times for NO REASON.  Look, I bought this movie because of the reviews on this site, hoping for something that vaguely resembled the only worthwhile poem that has ever been written.  And understandably there is no way to do the poem its full justice, but I was hoping for at least a fun story that was well-written.  This catastrophe of a movie was much more of a disappointment than I was expecting.

I'll give it this though:  the landscape was pretty.",1212624000,14,1481,4.553030303030303
2551269,5,B000F4PD7G,"This movie is great because it is a great laugh.  I have bought it for so many friends for birthdays and holidays that this itself becomes funny.

The insertion of Sarah Polley as a witch who did not appear in the actual original Beowulf tale/epic poem is itself genius.  She, unlike the rest of the actors, has a flat American accent (in ancient Scandinavia) and recites her lines with the same rhythm every sentence: dull and emotionless.  A great scene (SPOILER WARNING!) occurs when Beowulf (smitten, obviously) comes to visit her in her dank cave set apart from the village.  He's curious about Grendel, the troll, of course, and has come to seek her magickal advice.  She responds in defense of Grendel, again in her flat acting-less style, and then *FLASHBACK!* to her asleep in her cave, and suddenly, who should come bumbling in?  Good ol' Grendel, whose huge bulk he maneuvers through the tiny entrance.  He makes his way over to her, lying on her stomach, pulls away her blanket and skirt, and proceeds to impregnate her.  The *FLASHBACK!* ends, Beowulf, entranced, reaches forward to kiss her.  She pulls back, and says, drolly, ""Don't forget: I know how you die.""  And then, they too, have sex.  It's a wonderful script.  Brilliant timing.  Brilliantly bad acting.

The second best thing about this movie is Grendel himself.  He does not speak, of course, but mumbles unintelligibly to himself (the best noises being his sex noises, which are SOOO awkward and uncomfortable).  It's entertaining to watch him bowling with human skulls just because of his self-directing gurgling speech, his cartwheels, and his squeals of joy.  It's also fun to watch him mock the lone Christian in the land (a foreign priest), who, on a bet, spends the night outside with his rosary, praying in Latin, to prove his God will protect him from the monster.  Grendel creeps up behind and mimics his Latin mutterings, which is classic.  Also, Grendel is very stupid: once, while in the King's hall, his arm becomes entangled in a piece of rope hanging from the ceiling.  While he could cut the rope, Grendel chooses not to, and instead chops off his own arm.

I particularly love the cursing in this movie--it's just great because, here I am, watching an Old English epic poem playing on the screen, and so I'm expecting Old English dialogue, so forth, and am rewarded with the constant line of ""f***ing troll!""  This alone sets me in hysterics.

This should be a cult classic.  It really should.  I recommend it to everyone.  Also, it's so self-serious that you can tell it's not even intentionally a spoof (shame).  But don't expect to ACTUALLY think it's a good movie.  It's only great because it's SO bad.",1212624000,4,2700,4.7960954446854664

Gerard Butler was the most fantastic Beowulf.  He made you feel the climate and the atmosphere of the land and problems of the people,  I truely liked the fact that he took time to try and understand why Grendel only killed the tribe of the king and not him or the woman.

I really liked Sarah Polley's film ""Away From Her"", but I wasn't familiar with her as an actress, so I was eager to see her in this.  I had a hard time enjoying her performance,though, just because her accent (I thought it sounded Midwest, but I guess it's Canadian) seemed so incredibly out of place in the  story.

2551283,4,B000F4PD7G,"Since I'm on the Bathory kick I'd might as well talk about a viking type movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's common knowledge now that this movie isn't a faithful adaptation of the poem(but then again, no filmed version of Beowulf really is), but is it an entertaining movie?  Yup.  The poem was a little more of a cut and dry tale of good vs. evil, but this movie tries to blur those lines a bit.  Grendel's father is killed in the beginning by the Dane king, and he grows up to be a hate filled ""troll"" hell bent on revenge.  Kind of like a Troll Charles Bronson!  When the king builds a new mead hall, Grendel sees it as a good opportunity to swing on by whenever he feels like it and slaughter a few Danes.  Naturally the king doesn't care much for this and soon former Dane and badazz hero, Beowulf comes to the rescue.  Most of the movie is spent with Beowulf in pursuit of Grendel and piece by piece figuring out what the full story is(not to mention boinking Sarah Polley along the way).  Then he begins to have an inner conflict about what he's doing, and soon he finds he has Grendel's mother to deal with.  Folks like to yap about the deviation from the source material, so if this kinda stuff bugs you, you'd might as well keep away.  As an adventure movie, it's quite good.  Not to mention the movie is wonderful to look at being that it was shot entirely in Iceland.  If you watch the bonus features you'll see that it's a miracle the movie got made at all considering the harsh weather conditions.  One of the things brought up in many reviews both on Amazon and on the internet is that this movie has no cgi.  This is usually brought up as a high point and something considered unique about the movie.  It's rather a sad thing when the lack of cgi is considered a unique thing in an adventure movie these days.  It just shows how commonplace it is.  A few years ago it was exactly the opposite.  But this is very welcome since it makes the movie look real and not like a video game cut scene(ya hear that Mr. Zemeckis?).  Grendel was described in the poem as more monsterlike in appearance, but here he looks like stepped over from the set of Quest For Fire, but more muscular.  This is also a complaint to some, but I didn't mind it.  Grendel's mother looks a little more like she's described in the original story.  I haven't seen Gerard Butler in many films, but he makes a good hero.  And it is nice to see a fairly unfamiliar face in the lead when Hollywood would have just as soon stuck someone like Brad Pitt in the role, not because he's best for the part, but because he sells movie tickets.  All in all, I really enjoyed this movie, moreso than I thought I would.  You may not feel the same way, but I thought it was so refreshing to watch a good old fashioned adventure film with a budget as well as some obvious hard work put into it.",1201305600,,2857,4.25417439703154
2551284,5,B000F4PD7G,"I too had read Beowulf but unlike many negative reviews of this movie I must post significant disagreement with those citing ""not true to the poem"" reasons to dislike the movie. The recent ""Beowulf"" With Angelina Jolie was a suckfestival in that it did nothing for the story but make it visual. The troll was not special, just special effects. What I see in Beowulf and Grendle is not an exact interpretation but a more human view of an old legend. History is written by winners and the original writer of Beowulf either had one hell of an imagination or based his story on real events and in order to protect his head had to change names because back in those days criticism usually met a violent death. So in this intro let me regress. First of all like any movie is a certain amount of interpretation. I seen the 'Wild Wild West' and was shocked and Horrified to see James West played by a Black Man. That completely screwed with history and the original show I loved as a kid. So was James West now James Shaft West? (He is one bad Mother F... NOW SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Talkn' about J Shaft West!) Historically for a black man in that day and age being some secret agent man on many factual levels sends shivers down my back. Let us see him infiltrating some society of hard core Southerners. Shoo, can he go Chameleon and make himself white suddenly? Somehow I don't think Ulysses S. Grant would even shake his hand since he was a total racist (HISTORICAL FACT!!). I am not against black actors having lead roles at all and have seen inspired performances in many movies but Wild Wild West was one movie I refuse to own on the grounds of Distortion of American history and Distortion of an original TV show.
 The movie Earth Sea was another cite able disappointment because most of the characters were supposed to be black and not white like in the original book Earth Sea! Now with Beowulf and Grendle there is differences from the original poem and granted I am not that much of a buff on Scandinavians but what I do know of them was that they were not drunk rampaging barbarians. They were in fact a proper orderly society living in very rough conditions. They were explorers and warriors that often made money being paid to fight. Like anyone that lives hard they play hard. They were a warriors and artists, craftsmen, farmers, fishermen. They were not in a hurry to go to Valhallah like many picture Vikings. But they like other gifted people had some pretty far fetched imaginations. Sometimes ordinary people do things that seem extra ordinary and become legends thaks to others telling about their deeds.
Now lets face it, not everybody has the money to throw around for serious CGI or Angelina Jolie. For what was done with this movie I got to give props to the makers of this one. it put some rather interesting twists and humanization to what otherwise was a tough story to wrap my mind around. The movie 'Beowulf' sucked  miserably in comparison to Beowulf and Grendle. Where Beowulf in the movie 'Beowulf' came off as a loud obnoxious braggart and a sea demon making babies by the Danish kings and sending them off to make the Danes suffer 'Beowulf and Grendle' portrayed Grendle as a warrior but one with more of a brain rather than have him act like a WWF wrestler yelling ""I am Beowulf!"" all the time. Grendle had a real reason ""other than the noise bothered him"" to lay waste to the Danes. Yes the movie had a gritty feel to it but then again I had a history teacher who liked to show the movie Jabberwocky (NOT Monty Python but it had a lot of the Python cast in it!!!) to us in High School because it was the most realistic look at Medieval life available at the time. People didn't bath often then and without a water heater who would? If you are looking for grandiose spectacle and fantastic structures and special effects galore and big ugly inhuman trolls go to the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. The beer hall in 'Beowulf and Grendle' would have been the biggest and best structure of the day. The ships were very period and Iceland ponies would have been used instead of regular horses BECAUSE THEY HAD TO BRING THEM ON THEIR BOATS AND REGULAR HORSES DO NOT DO WELL AT ALL IN THOSE COLD CONDITIONS!!! Back then you went with what works and small ponies fit on the boats better than large horses. Iceland ponies were bread to deal with the harsh conditions and travel by sea if necessary. There also is the concept of a troll to grapple with. It was an insult as well as a reference to a monster. The troll in the movie was a man but he was a rather big (and I mean HUGE) man and was very strong. He seemed impervious to cold. Pissed off with a big sword in his hand he would have been someone I would even question an AK-47 stopping. In that day a man like that on a rampage would have been considered a monster. Heck, even today of someone like that were to rampage they would be described and feared as a monster and not a man.
If anything take this movie with a gain of salt and think of it as what could have inspired the legend. granted it was not done by any super studio and does not have famous top name actors in it but is will shock and horrify you in ways that other movies failed! It was quirky and had a feel to it that was sincere to the medieval era. Nothing about it was anachronistic. Nothing went out into left field. Grendle was not exactly a monster. The Danes made him one. This is a movie of double revenge and twisted truth. I liked it on many levels from performance, scenery, plot, flow of story, and it did manage to keep the breadcrumbs coming until the revelation of the truth. The witch was way different as well. Not like what any would classically expect.
I may not be some college educated study on legends or writing or movies but I know what has heart and what doesn't. 'Beowulf and Grendle' has heart and a lot of it. I recommend this for at least one viewing. NOT FOR CHILDREN OR THE SQUEAMISH. Has some limited sex but it also has some very dramatic violent moments (and I am not talking about when Grendle go on a smash-a-thon in the beer hall!). Rated R for a damn good reason.

2551287,5,B000F4PD7G,"This interpretation looks beyond the poem to what may have inspired the literary piece. What is a ""monster""? In Grendel's case, he probably was a misunderstood humanoid with a bit of a temper problem. Considering the anthropological evidence and the time period, he was mostly likely a Neanderthal. With a wider ribcage, short legs, large arms, and wider head, he probably looked like a ""monster."" He was from a dying race of humanoids left to wander the open fields as his natural habitat, the forest, disappeared from climate change. I'd have temper problems, too.

This film removes the sensationalism that is found within the literature and gives it to us on a more human level. Today's modern audiences see past the imagery of what was once considered ""heroic."" Taking emphasis away from Beowulf and the ""King"" and focusing more on the Grendel, the existential ""other,"" this film becomes more accessible to today's contemporary audiences than the poem could ever hope to be.

2551288,4,B000F4PD7G,"Why this movie has been ill criticized by many critics and plain movie goers is a mistery to me. I know that many complaints come from the fact that this is not a faithful adaptation of the epic poem. But first of all, it's been said many times that a movie should be judge by its merits alone (movies have a hard time translating the emotions and content of a book or a story) and I don't see any problem with making a movie just inspired in a legend, if it is well done.
This is the case with B&G. First of all, in spite of not having special effects, or CGI's, or big sets, it never looks cheap. The landscapes of Iceland are its best asset, because of their beauty and their quality and look of a legendary place. The costumes add authenticity too.
The acting is very good, specially Stellan Skarsgard as the tormented King Hrothgar and Sarah Poley (as usual) as Selma the Witch, with Gerald Butler providing an acceptable charaterization of the hero (which by the way is far from being a super-hero, and more down to earth).
The movie hasn't forgotten completely that some fantasy, legend or myth must remain in the story, but its approach is that all those legends must have had a human origin, magnificated and made mythical by the passing of time and oral tradition. And for me, this is a plus: it provides a human background to the story, and keeps it human for the most part. That may be a shock for many: if you expect a typical legendary monster movie, you won't find it here. Neither will you find a non-stop action movie ""300"" style. B&G is more drama than action.
I'm afraid to say that as a commercial product, the movie has some hollywod-esque concessions (constant cursing -somehow justified by the director and crew in their commentary-, the obligatory romance). But those are minor flaws, and I don't think that will affect you appreciation of the movie, once you have the proper frame of mind to watch it.

NOW ABOUT THE BLU RAY: I've read that the transfer has been criticized by some. The fact is that in daylight scenes this tranfer is as good looking as any I've seen. Believe me, the grandeur of the landscapes is reason alone to own this movie in Blu Ray. The mountains, the waterfalls, the beaches...make me wanna be there.
It's the nightime scenes that look a little ordinary, just standard, closer to a plain DVD. But I wouldn't put the whole blame in the quality of the transfer; it is that those scenes have been filmed with just the neccesary light. Is this a flaw? I don't think so. It provides more authenticity.
But yes, there is a particular scene (a dialogue between Beowulf and Hrothgar) that isn't even a nightime scene, in which the quality is very low, and that is because of the transfer and the original print: it looks stained and with a constant flashing. (That flashing is present also in another early daytime scene -when little Grendel is seen running in the beach-, but is less perceptible). But these are no reasons to dismiss the Blu Ray as a bad product, because most of the movie look pristine and very clear and detailed.

As for extras, well, this is the part in which the Blu Ray will leave you wanting. There's a commentary, which is said to be done ""by the director and screenwriter"" but that in fact includes a couple of more people, and that is very entertaining and informative -and is very insistent about this movie being made the old fashion way, little computer help). There is also ""storyboard comparisons"", and some trailers. The DVD version of the movie has more extras and that's something that I will never understand: do they really expect us to buy the DVD also just because it has more material in it?. Come on, be fair, and include the same material in the blu ray release !. This is what made me downgrade my rating.

The audio track is Dolby Digital, plus a PCM option. The dolby track is very good, just check a couple of scenes near a waterfall, or near the ocean and you will hear the water all around you. It also provides a good enhancement of the music during the movie. The feature only has ENGLISH subtitles.

So, if you loved this movie, there's no reason you shouldn't own this blu ray. If you have a blu ray player, this is a good movie to own. There's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the story (I repeat, as long as you don't expect a faithfull retelling of the old poem, or an action-packed movie) but anyway, the Iceland landscapes won't let you regret it.",1199664000,4,4449,4.482120838471023
2551289,3,B000F4PD7G,"Look at the film's title closely. It is ""Beowulf & Grendel"" not ""Beowulf vs. Grendel"" or ""Beowulf the Warrior."" It should be ""and"" because it is a revisionist version where Grendel is not just a monster and Beowulf is a fighter who has self-doubt. In a sense the 2007 Hollywood blockbuster is more faithful to the original poem as Ray Winstone's hero never hesitates before fighting Grendel or ""the monster.""

So don't expect traditional heroic tale of warriors, bloody fighting with flesh-tearing monsters. Heavily bearded Gerard Butler plays Beowulf, but his character makes a marked contrast with his King Leonidas in ""300"" where the good is always good, the bad is always bad and the warriors fight and kill without doubting their actions. Here Butler plays Beowulf who is caught between the two sides.

Of course, whoever wrote the original epic poem must have intended it to be read literally and the film's beautiful cinematography captures the world of the original poem. However, the filmmakers added several elements to explain the background of Grendel, who is a troll sort of misunderstood or ill-treated. I do not disagree with the idea itself, but unfortunately the idea is done in a heavy-handed fashion.

I watched this partly because it stars gifted Sarah Polley. Sarah Polley plays a ""witch"" who has something to tell, something Beowulf (and we) should know. I really like her, but her presence and her words look and sound too modern and somehow we are supposed to believe every word of her while it seems one character (always raving something) represents Christianity. That is too crude a way to present balanced perspectives.

I am not saying this is a terrible film. It was not just my cup of tea. Still I think the slow-moving film spends so many words (including f-words) that before we start to really think, they give us answers. Or maybe we have seen too many revisionist versions of old tales when we want them in an old-fashioned way, like the old poem where no one questions the values of fame and glory.",1199059200,3,2035,4.855907780979827

I also knew that Gerard Butler was the star of 300 and he was playing Beowulf. I thought this would be a standard remake of classic literature. Instead I found it to be quite compelling and sometimes very funny. They told the tale with a bit of a twist showing Grendels side of the story and making him considerably more real and sympathetic. Gerard Butler was excellent as was the rest of the cast. Also the cinematography was just beautiful.

Anyone who has anything negative to say about this beautiful film, should take the time and watch the making of Beowulf & Grendel.  Titled ""Wrath of the Gods"", an award winning documentary that shows the difficulties of filming a dream, with very limited backing and support. Not to mention the money.
A film not dependent on special effects, but on pure acting ability, and filmed on location in the harshest of climates.  As  far as I'm concerned, it is far more realistic and enjoyable than the latest feature, ""Beowulf"" with Angelina Jolie. So, watch the new one for the special effects, but  be sure to give ""Beowulf & Grendel"" a chance, in its own right.",1195948800,2,924,4.508982035928144

2551295,1,B000F4PD7G,"BEOWULF & GRENDEL is a visually stunning (both good and bad) retelling of the epic tale of man vs. beast.  The filmmakers attempt to update the story, this time including Grendel's side of the story, giving him motivation for his bloodthirsty rampages.  The effort is ultimately wasted as the ludicrous script is laden with preposterous dialogue and even more rediculous acting.

Grendel (and his ""family"") are essentially oversized neanderthal-men... an interesting concept that gives them interactions and emotions as opposed to the traditional telling which makes them faceless man-eaters.  However, for all his grunting, moaning, and flexing rubber muscles (some of the WORST prosthetic work since the Planet of the Apes TV series), he still doesn't seem to garner much sympathy.  He does, however, somehow manage to father another man/beast with the neighborhood witch (who else?) in one of the most bizarre ""conception"" scenes ever - the witch appears to placidly accept her ""taking"" by a giant ogre, then in the retelling of the event gets heated up enough to ""jump"" Beowulf, giving the man and beast more than one thing in common.  Eee[...]  (Let's hope this doesn't open the door to a sequel.)

Filmed in rural Iceland, the scenery is engrossing, stark and probably the most believably emotive character in the movie.  The ""hero"" Beowulf makes no attempt to adjust his heavy Scottish accent despite his character's supposed Swedish heritage.  He looks bored.  And tired.  I got bored and tired watching him.  The witch makes no attempt to adjust her straightforward american accent... blah, blah, blah...  She looks more like a disgruntled university student who wants to show the world what a bad-a-- she can be.  Heck, I guess a roll in the hay with Grendel gives you street cred...

If you're hoping for blood, guts, or battle scenes, they're too few and far between, but remarkably unexciting.  Imagine Steve Carrell wielding a sword in a bad 70's kung-fu movie and you'll get a pretty good idea of the fight choreography quality.

The bottom line is every one in the film appeared uncomfortable in their roles, clothes, dialogue, on camera, and/or with whatever they had for lunch.  I wanted to toss my cookies, too.",1193616000,6,2230,5.06027397260274

What a shame. The only reason it will do well is because of her.
Back to reality here. Beowolf and Grendel is a great story, the dvd has good features, the realistic nature of the movie is worth the price of admission alone. Gerard Butlers one liners are fitting. The historic accuracy of this film is amazing. I have heard people complain about the size of the horses. That part of the world only had ponies at the time.

2551297,5,B000F4PD7G,"Knowing that Im into historical reinactment (mostly vikings & their predessors) one of my friends bought me this for my birthday.  I nearly killed him as I exected this to be another unwatchable pile of garbage like Pathfinder.  However, I owed him a major apology as Beowulf & Grendel turned out to be an excellent movie.

  Somehow, with a fairly low budget, they pulled it off.  They knew when and where to put the money for the best result & did so.  Excellently writen, it stays very close to the real story of Beowulf.  The plotline was simple, but it didn't lack depth to it. The armor, weapons, clothing, building, etc.  were simple, functional, and fairly historically accurate.  The landsacpe it was filmed it made for breathtaking backgrounds.  And they gained major bonus points by actually adding depth to Grendel: they portray him as an intelligent being, and not just a mindless monster.

  Beowulf is an action movie with intelligence that bears more resemblance to the older epics rather than a modern slash-em-up.  It does justice to the story, and I am very happy to have it on my shelf.  If you like historical movies similar to ""13th Warrior"" and ""Tristan & Isolde"" I highly reccomend this movie.",1192060800,6,1217,4.778846153846154

2551299,2,B000F4PD7G,"I have to believe that the director or the writer of this film has connection to the death-metal scene and/or that kind of market was his intended audience. Because there's lots of modernity about the hairstyles, earrings, decorations, jokes, and dialog rather than there is anything Anglo-Saxon about it. I do have to give kudos to the scenery captured on film here. It is stunning and evocative. But, unfortunately, usually what it evokes is a bad joke or hearty beer-yell or chest thump. That's probably one of my problems with the film. For instance, when the King Hygelac sends Beowulf off, he tells him, ""And make sure you bring back a wife; our sheep have had enough."" Gerard Butler plays a beer-drinking blowhard, and Hrothgar is the most pitiful drunk one's ever seen. There's a scene where Grendel scares the whits out of Beowulf and his boys by shaking the door and then urinating on the doorstep; then out jump Beowulf and his thanes, Anglo-Saxon yells penetrating the dark, swords at the ready, and then they stamp and cough and choke once they get a whiff of Grendel's gift. That kind of humor and odd-ball anticlimacticism represents this film in a nutshell. There are some fun things here. The young Grendel, with the white whispy beard of an old man (it's kind of like chicken feathers, really; they're white and whispy before they turn any kind of color) is a wonderful, old-school makeup creation. But then he cuts Dad's head off and leaves in the cave as a memento mori and, I guess, just because he loves him so much. I'll leave it at that. This is a weird film. But worth watching. This is Monty-Python meets Beowulf with just enough of the literature thrown in to call it ""Beowulf."" (There's some bad translation, too. Like the first scene's entitlement:  ""A Hatred is Born."" Not very stylish.) If you're into beer and cheers and double entendre and half-machismo, this is for you.",1190764800,4,1904,4.734939759036145

But for telling an exciting story, this movie is pretty dull. There's a lot of talking and standing around, but not much action. Other problems include sporadic dialog that is too modern and out of place, and the actors accents. The hero, Beowulf, who is from Sweden, is played nicely by Gerard Butler but he makes no attempt to hide his Scottish accent. Sarah Polley plays a Danish witch with a flat American accent. Everytime they spoke I found it jarring as it just didn't fit. The character of the witch and a few other elements are add-ons to the original material and aren't needed and don't really work.

If you are looking for quick and slick brainless and mindless drivel, don't bother to watch.  However, if you want to watch Beowulf come to life in a modern, stark telling that will be bold and challenging to moviegoers, then take a good look at this movie.

2551310,4,B000F4PD7G,"""Beowulf and Grendel"" is a descent re-telling of the epic poem ""Beowulf,"" the oldest poem written in the English language. While it isn't the best film ever made, it has an interesting premise: Grendel, a giant human, attempts to avenge the death of his father at the hands of King Hrothgar and his men, while the Geat warrior Beowulf comes to Hrothgar's kingdom to hunt him down. Gerard Butler is in top form as Beowulf, and Sarah Polley is beautiful in her role as a witch, while Hringur Ingvarsson gives us a Grendel who is not evil, but a man who seeks to kill the men who killed his father, who loved him deeply. In this film, the viewer will feel more inclined to cheer for Grendel than Beowulf, and that is to be expected.
The problems with the film stem from the choppy editing, which could confuse the viewer if he doesn't pay attention all the way through. Also, with the dialects in the film, viewers might find a hard time understanding what some of the characters are saying. There is also a limited amount of action in the film, so some will find the film dull.
Overall, this is an O.K. rendering of the heroic story to the screen. It's a good movie for everyone to view once.

Despite his diet of people the king cannot think of a reason that he should have dispatched Grendel's father beyond the coincidence of their paths crossing. Such enormous liberties were taken with the story- to present the hero as the bad guy and the monster as the tragic hero!

He has a true, beautiful ability to capture the essence of characters in other times whether it be myth, legend or fantasy. I am sure most of us studied Beowulf in high school. And probably again, found it ... well to be a little boring and hard to understand. This story sets such a perfect feeling and look for the minds eye, that if studied again, Beowulf might be realized for each of us.

The look and location of this movie is so well chosen (even though it may also have caused many problems filming) that one definitely knows what life might have been like.  They also capture a feeling of a ""troll"" that was totally different than I had ever pictured.  We actually feel for the creature.

Critics seemed indifferent to it and, although I'm from an entertainment-journalism family, I'd heard nothing about the film, so I figured it would be a long slog. OK, yes, the film is long, yet it goes surprising places. The story you think it will be is not the story that it turns out to be. The landscape is bleak and yet oddly inspiring, and the terrific performances from Stellan Skaarsgard and Gerard Butler--in what seem to me extremely complicated roles, particularly Skaarsgard's--bring life to what looks like a suicidally bleak existence lived by these Danes. Sorry, but a pint of grog and a wench don't seem as if they'd put the average guy in a good enough frame of mind to survive a few decades in the blinding fog (never mind the women's lives).

In this version Grendel isn't much of a monster, but rather a poor, misunderstood, confused adolescent-type seeking revenge on the Danes who selfishly killed his father many years before. It seems to go downhill from there. Lots of missed opportunity for real story-telling/movie-making.

HOWEVER, what I did find interesting and even intriguing are some of the special features like the replay with commentary and a segment from a documentary ""Wrath of Gods"" about the making of ""Beowulf and Grendel."" The movie was shot in Iceland which has some breath taking scenery that is actually quite dangerous to shoot in. There is one moment on a beach where the waves are over forty feet high and the tide is coming in dangerously fast. In fact one big wave almost washes away a $100,000 camera lens, an SUV and 2 workers! Another scene on a four hundred foot shear cliff is intense and exciting as they describe the dangers in shooting it. At times this part of the DVD is actually a kind of dramatic and informative story itself: vulnerable people accomplishing something challenging by overcoming obstacles in sometimes near impossible conditions.

Just wish it were something worthwhile they accomplished. Beowulf is a great story and deserves an epic presentation in its own right. This is not it.",1175817600,7,1449,5.008298755186722

Michael Crichton's ""Eaters of the Dead"" which was turned into ""The 13th Warrior"" which was another good spin on the tale but not close to the poem either.  I mean there are some works of literature that can't be reduced to two or three hours of screen time.  That being said.  I thought this movie was pretty good, its not the best I have ever seen but I thought that the idea of making Grendel someone who has feelings and emotion was a good idea.  I was always terrified of the thought of Grendel as a girl, I read the poem and was frightened sometimes to think of that terrible monster.  Stellan S.  is a favorite of mine, he is what I called an under appreciated actor, always very transporting in his parts but never a star.  A great character actor.  As for Gerard B. well, let's just say that I have watched him from Mrs. Brown, where I said, ""Who's is the cutie?"" through Attila and now into 300...as always, he is a feast for the eyes but a great actor as well.

I'm a university instructor and have used BEOWULF in my classes.  (The Michael Alexander version is best).  So I was very anxious to see this version of BEOWULF and was not disappointed.  I thought perhaps the movie might have owed something to John Gardner's version of the story (GRENDEL).  Gardner's GRENDEL goes a long way toward humanizing the ""monster,"" but this movie goes even further, dropping the idea that Grendel was descended from Cain all together.  In fact, the movie is a perfect representation of how the world has changed since the original epic was written.  Our whole idea of heroes is different now.  Hence Beowulf is conflicted and the differences between right and wrong are blurred.  It is also refreshing to watch a movie that is filmed in a real location and not in front of a blue screen!

I just wish Hollywood could understand this when they make big budget movies. The actor Gerard Butler is just now being recognized for his work in 300. I noticed his potential in Dracula 2000.

2551331,2,B000F4PD7G,"Politically correct version of first English epic poem about Nordic warriors in the 12th century and their heroic leader Beowulf who try to help their Danish kinsmen rid themselves of a murderous troll named Grendel. Director Sturla Gunnarsson uses the story of Beowulf as an excuse to shoot a film in the strikingly beautiful but barren landscape of Iceland. There are so many problems with this production, it is hard to appreciate the few things that are good. Like the dialogue: a strange mixture of traditional English and current London slang. Or the accents: a cacophony of Scottish, British, cockney - you name it. Or the costumes: the warriors look like they picked theirs up at a London costume shop - they show no wear or use at all. And where did they get them? There are no blacksmiths, no tanners, no weavers, no workmen of any kind in the film. The only activity anyone seems to be engaged in is drinking beer. And who produces the beer? There are no brewers, no farmers, no farm animals, no farms. Only a beer hall.

Gerard Butler stars in this ""epic"" as Beowulf, and, in my opinion, it is the low point in his career - even worse than Timeline, if that is possible. To add insult to injury, in the extra features, he tries to talk intelligently about what the director was trying to achieve, and it truly is laughable. The only thing I can make out is that the director was trying to show that Beowulf the poem was a piece of literary trash. So, why make a film about it? He makes the Danes out to be one step above Neanderthals. Yet, in only one century, we will have the story of Hamlet in Denmark, who was a contemporary of William Wallace in Scotland. How did the Danes advance so far in only one century if they were so stupid in Beowulf's day? Obviously, Gunnarsson didn't think about that.

Everything has been dumbed down - for Gunnarsson's drinking buddies, I suppose. The humor is crude and would only seem funny if we were as drunk as the characters in the film. The warriors ride about on little horses, probably native to the region; but they make them look silly and ineffective. There is a sex scene between the troll Grendel (played by Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson) and the witch Selma (played by Sarah Polley). It truly is tasteless. After making the case for Grendel not being a monster but just a misunderstood human, the filmmakers throw in a sea hag, who is obviously not human and not misunderstood. So, what are we supposed to believe about her? The final insult to our intelligence is when Beowulf tells the troll's son that he should be proud of his father, and then builds a monument to him.

Whoever wrote Beowulf is probably spinning in his grave. This truly is one of the low points in the history of literature and film. Except for the gorgeous landscapes and interesting cinematography, there is very little to recommend this film. There could have been some decent performances, because there are some good actors, if only Andrew Rai Berzins, who wrote the screenplay, had given them something to work with. This may have been good enough for Gunnarsson and his drinking buddies to use as an excuse to take a paid vacation in Iceland; but it shouldn't have been good enough for Gerard Butler to waste his career on, and it certainly isn't good enough for the rest of us to waste our time on.

2551332,1,B000F4PD7G,"""No, no no!"" This was no doubt my most common reaction to what I saw in this film. Rewritten with a total disdain of the mood and theme of the original epic, this movie take instead decides to show a groveling, nose-wiping Nordic culture, where everyone save the couple of women in the film are cheap, below-the-belt people. Even Beowulf himself is shown to be an overweight braggart, and Hrothgar, an honorable model for a king in the epic, is a mead-oozing disaster zone.

Added are a couple of meaningless characters, an Irish priest who provides a sneering look towards Dark-Age Christianity, and a witch-woman who is of course a completely misunderstood, sensitive person. Can anyone say stereotypes?

Grendel is the worst part of the film: a 'troll', really nothing more than a slightly taller man who cannot speak language, supposedly very hairy but really no more so than any number of Danes or Geats! This movie nonsensically decides to portray Grendel (the ""God-cursed brute"", ""monster"", etc.) as ANOTHER misunderstood soul, mellow and loyal toward his 'family'... I say, what? Indeed. A pitiful lack of special effects makes him no more than a tall man with fake hair all over his body. His performance is anything but memorable.

From a technical aspect, this movie is horrible. I don't care what your tastes are, it is pathetically filmed. bad camera angles, bad setup, and terrible light metering. Most of the film is underexposed, while its bright moments are too bright. Continuity is just as bad as you might expect given the general lack of skill here, and dialogue is right awful - accents are unrefined; not exactly bad, but there are many lines that are just unintelligible.

All in all, nearly everything in this story is retold in cheap-postmodern-novel form, with a dispensing of the fresh and dynamic Christianity of the original (made the more interesting for pieces of its character still echoing the pagan days) for a silly modern neo-paganism, most unauthentic, as wicca so often is, and it goes so far as to bash the Christian religion multiple times. This is a film which has no loyalty to the classic story beloved by many for not decades, not centuries, but a millenium.

I am not a complainer by nature; if you take a look at my other reviews you'll see that this is so. But I must open my mouth when it comes to this one. If you want to experience Beowulf in the form that made it what it is, find poet Seamus Heaney's recital of his excellent verse translation on compact disk. That is the best Beowulf out there, short of the Anglo-Saxon we don't speak.",1174694400,22,2590,4.759465478841871

2551334,5,B000F4PD7G,"When I first learned of Beowulf and Grendel, I wanted to see it for its star, Gerard Butler.  I then heard of director Sturla Gunnersson's commitment to it, and I had attended the fine new Elliot Goldenthal/Julie Taymor opera, Grendel, inspired by the John Gardner novel that portrays Grendel an outcast.  Well, the movie has convinced me!  Strange and beautiful, it has become one of my favorites.

The film opens to the stark majesty of the craggy Icelandic coast.  This chapter, captioned ""A Hate is Born,"" quickly unfolds to a sickening scene as the child Grendel (played by the real-life son of actor Ingvar Eggert Sigurasson, the adult Grendel) suffers a horrific atrocity.  His life is then spared out of compassion by Hrothgar, his attacker and King of the Danes.  This good deed does not atone and, years later, when the prosperous King constructs a mead hall for his people to enjoy, the adult  troll takes murderous revenge.  The King's men have drunk their mead and are sleeping, defenseless against Grendel's strength and rage.

We next meet our hero, Beowulf, who has washed up on desolate Fish Beach a shipwreck victim.  It is implied that this soggy event gives birth to the legend that he can swim the oceans, and is also a great introduction to Gerard Butler's Beowulf, wryly played as brave and committed, but downplaying his heroic reputation.  Beowulf acts out of a sense of duty when he embarks with his gang to defend Hrothgar and the Danes against the evil troll.  In due course, Beowulf uncovers another side to the matter.

Gerard Butler shines in this movie.  Larger-than-life by nature, Mr. Butler gives us a Beowulf that is physical, thoughtful and a bit of a loner.  Stellan Skarsgard's messy Hrothgar plays against Butler with ease as a drunken, grief-struck king who fluctuates between insanity, nobility and political cover-up.  Ingvar Sigurasson's portrayal of Grendel is marvelous: terrifying, yet sweet and humorous when he imitates the fanatical Celtic priest; joyous and defiant at his empowerment; and despairing when his time has come to an end.  Sarah Polley, as Selma the witch, underplays as a woman bearing the terrible burden of seeing ""how people die.""  She is lovely as a bitter survivor.  Her character also provides insight into Grendel's condition.  And the soundtrack is breathtaking, like the movie --  bright, beautiful, cold and primitive.

This DVD also includes excerpts from the documentary entitled Wrath of Gods, about the making of Beowulf and Grendel.  Watch these segments.  You might find the harsh conditions that the players endured to make this movie, such as driving horizontal rain and wind gusts that knocked out car windows, more difficult to swallow than the existence of the terrifying Sea Witch!",1174608000,,2768,5.030769230769231

Too bad for Mr. Butler, it's not his fault.  He has real talent as well as fabulous looks and a shining personality.  It would be real nice if the film industry could recognize it and give him the roles he deserves with directors and editors that have some talent.

As you'll read in other comments, the scenery is ruggedly beautiful, the acting good, and the tale as interesting as the original tale.  It does move at a pace that is slow for Americans, but Americans (I'm one) should slow down and get lost in the tale (have a beer while you watch it).  As you may know, Beowulf was written from a Christian perspective on a bleak, old world better left behind.  Christianity subtly pokes its head into this film without being annoying or proselytizing.  Beowulf is heroic in this film not because of his exploits, but because he gains insight into struggle between the trolls and the Danes.

When I first saw this movie what caught my attention was the sweeping landscape they used in the movie which gave this film an authentic backdrop---just the way it was pictured in my mind when I was first introduced to the original literature during my middle school years. Although the plot is somewhat ""not faithful"" to the old English/Norse saga, it is in itself a cinematic accomplishment. The writer/s did a good job in reinterpreting a very mythic subject to make it more accessible to the modern audience. It is very difficult how to depict Grendel & mom if we stick to the original desription of them which would just make the movie silly and absurd. Giving them a Neanderthal-like quality is no problem with me. At least the film followed the general essence of the original literature.

1. sweeping, windy, frigid landscapes with a sort of terrifying beauty

2. modern revisionism that updates a classic adventure tale's meaning

3. extremely attractive Northern European he-males

--you may wanna skip Beowulf.

And yet...and yet, I suggest you try it, even though I was less than blown away.

Why?

Well, certainly number one above. Visually, this film takes you someplace stunningly cool (metaphorically, not just literally), an environment so bleak in spots and so callous in others and so apathetic to human suffering, that it's a fitting background for this stark tale of revenge and bloodshed and loss and heroics and loyalty. A cold wind surely does blow, outside and inside the soul.

Also, you may enjoy the revisionist take. Grendel is now the terribly injured party dealing with a sort of bigotry for his ""monsterhood"": He and his kind are hated for being different, ugly, smelly,  not evil. (I believe, if memory serves from the long-ago high school reading, that Grendel did represent evil, and not merely a symbol of aggrieved minority.)

And almost certainly you will enjoy the charisma of actor Gerard Butler. That man is good. He can act--see THE JURY or PHANTOM OF THE OPERA or DEAR FRANKIE or even CRADLE OF LIFE to see how he can inhabit various types of roles and make them come to life with that combination of personal magnetism, vocal expression, facial expression, body language and just plain emotive power. I have no idea why this man is not a huge, huge star. He's got everything it takes, the complete package of ridiculous good looks and acting chops and versatility. He can be funny or menacing or romantic or so vulnerable you weep. Perhaps 300 will do it for him in 2007.

As to the others: Stellan Skarsgaard is dependably good as an actor, if not always top-notch. He's good here, definitely a man chased by a Gredelian fury for his bloody deed long ago. Sarah Polley is less effective as the witch, and yet not totally ineffective. She simply was miscast. (She was terrific in THE SWEET HEREAFTER and I liked her in GO! and know she can act. It's just not a good fit for her, this role.)

Still, at the end of the day, Gerard Butler and the marvelous landscape are the two reasons to buy or rent or just borrow this DVD. Two potent forces of nature--Iceland and Butler--do manage to make a somewhat lackluster movie work in spots.

Bottom line: Try it, because parts of it work. And if you're a Gerard Butler fan, buy it, because he is a gift to cinema and quite easy on the eyes and ears. And if you can't travel to a high Northern wilderness, but kind of want to, visit a remote and windy spot with BEOWULF & GRENDEL.",1172188800,55,2706,4.624217118997913
2551355,4,B000F4PD7G,"In 2001, a new translation of the saga of Beowulf was published, and became an unlikely bestseller. How many copies were actually read probably remained on a par with Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time,"" or Pirsig's ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance""-but with this translation the tale I remembered hearing in part as a child was brought into the 21st century.

In 2005, a movie called ""Beowulf and Grendel"" was released. It bore an interesting twist. Grendel was given reason to hate King Hrothgar and attack his hall: Hrothgar killed his father over a stolen fish, and left the child to starve. This is established in the first minutes of the story, and sets the scene for a movie that explores what might really have happened.

Throughout, I got a sense that the director, Sturla Gunnarson, was trying to look at this from a ""what if"" kind of persepctive. What if the ""monster"" were not a monster, but something that might have been a last stray remnant of Neanderthal man? Different, but not too different? Details I remembered as a child, such as Grendel dying by having his arm torn off, were given a different slant. The witch, Selma, had been a prisoner of war, forced into the role of concubine, and then outcast. In this rendition, Beowulf is not just an epic hero, righteous and sure of himself, but also a thinking, intelligent man who comes to realize that the king is not giving him the whole story. The troll doesn't harm his men until they offer him insult.

Interwoven with all this is the coming of Christianity to this land, through the blessings of a crazy Irish monk. The new faith offers succor when the old gods don't seem to be doing much for the Danes. Even the king is despairing, drinking himself to death through grief for his lost men and remorse over his own part in this story. He converts out of desperation, and his doing so does give a sense of how this wild land might have come to convert.

While on the face of it the plot does follow that of the saga, the modern twist and at times very brutal and crude scenes do make this more of a nod to the original than ""the movie of the legend of Beowulf."" Taken in that vein, it's entertaining, even thought-provoking. The scenes with Grendel's mother do, however, make little sense; nothing is done to explain where she fits in and where she came from and why she wasn't cohabiting with Grendel and Grendel's father in the first place. Her scenes seem almost stuck on, superfluous to the main action. I would have liked to have seen her explained better.

PROS AND CONS

On the plus side are the film's great visuals: very authentic and interesting costumes, awe-inspiring locations, charismatic actors. The script is also quite interesting, offering an unorthodox approach on re-telling the Beowulf tale for a contemporary audience.

Unfortunately, the film doesn't unleash its full potential. It lacks pacing and temperament, feels a bit slow and unfocussed at times.
Some of the characters and plot facettes are not satisfyingly developed.

Luckily, the film makes up for its lackings in dramaturgy and storytelling through great humor and certain loftiness that perfectly captures the Viking-era zeitgeist. Beowulf and his gang of hard-boiled norse machos are just a load of fun.

The film's greatest merit, however, is that it achieves a very difficult thing: it manages to feel fresh and innovative on the one hand, and at the same time in its heart remains true to the themes of the original source material, the Beowulf epos.

BOTTOM LINE

What you should expect: a very atmospheric budget film that has its shortcomings, but is well worth seeing. Particularly recommended for anyone familiar with the Beowulf epos or an interest in the epoch.

What you should not expect: while the film is quite gory at times, it can't really be called an action movie. Don't get this DVD if you are looking for hours of over-the-top fighting and special effects.",1171065600,5,1522,5.209016393442623
2551358,4,B000F4PD7G,"I bought this DVD, not having seen it, but as a fan of stories about the Dark Ages and as an owner of the fantastic Beowulf translation by Seamus Heaney. (Ok, and as a Gerard Butler fan too -- I admit it.) So, I watched ""Beowulf and Grendel"" and -- it's not what I was expecting. Not to give too much away, but the script is not a ""faithful"" retelling of the Anglo-Saxon poem, so if that's what you're wanting and expecting then perhaps this isn't the version you'd want to buy. (Personally, my all-time favorite spin on the Beowulf story is ""The 13th Warrior,"" which I highly recommend for any fan of Viking-era sagas. Plus it stars Antonio Banderas.)

However, if you have an open mind and can stand watching a different perspective of the hero Beowulf (and the monster Grendel, too) then I'd suggest this DVD for you. The movie has a strong cast, and delves more into the characters' possible backstories and motivations. (It gives us some new characters as well.) It's definitely a thought-provoking movie, and I'd suggest listening to the director's and producers' commentary afterwards, to get a better idea of what they were aiming to depict onscreen.

I'd also recommend reading the Beowulf poem in tandem with seeing the movie ... and then discussing both, comparing and contrasting the differences. Yes, this is a movie that strays from the poem, but the attention to detail (costumes, as well as scenery), the acting, fight scenes, and the unusual take on the story make it a keeper, in my opinion. Definitely not just a monster movie, and there are little or no special effects in this production, since the director wanted to keep it as ""real"" as possible.

And for those Gerry Butler fans out there who can't wait to see him as King Leonidas in ""300,"" this film might tide you over until then ... he does make a very convincing Beowulf.

The hero, Beowulf, helps a king whose drinking hall is beset by a monster who kills all who sleep there. Beowulf kills the monster and then kills the monster's mother. What is unclear from the story is what the monster is and what, if any, motivations there are beyond heroic slaughter. This film corrects that and does so in a plausible manner.

Grendel is a troll, a sort of human. Years ago, Hrothgar killed a troll while staking out his claim on his land. Watching this happen is the small child, Grendel. Years later, Grendel has grown up into a full sized troll and is out for vengeance. He has a score to settle. He makes distinctions between those who can hurt him (warriors) and those who can't. He also distinguishes between those with whom he has a grudge (Hrothgar's Danes) and those with whom he does not. Beowulf does not make such fine distinctions, at least at first. He is out to play the hero who does great deeds.

He does his great deeds, eventually with a bit of regret, and manages to slay the monster and then the monster's vengeance minded mother. It is all pretty well in keeping with the saga. It is also entertaining.

The costuming and the set seem to be accurate to my knowledge.  Beowulf is a difficult work to turn into a movie to begin with and this is the most heroic effort I've seen.  Gerard Butler was great as the heroe, although the the Scotish accent didn't seem quite right.  The original was in Anglo-saxon and therefore they should have been more Germanic sounding.  Likewise the setting was too rocky for Denmark, at least I don't think that the Jutland Peninsula is quite that rugged.

2551367,4,B000F4PD7G,"A classic tale of man vs. monster is re-told with great skill in this movie. When the hairy little troll, Grindel, loses his father to some blood-thirsty Danes, a wound is opened in the younster's heart that will never heal. When Grindel grows to manhood he seeks revenge on the men responsible for his father's death, collecting their heads to lay before the decomposed skull of 'Papa' that the troll keeps in a cave. One can't help but feel a twinge of sympathy for the troll. Then Beowulf and his brave men are asked to aid King Hrothgar by killing the troll, but Beowulf discovers that the Danish King hasn't told him the entire story and isn't blameless in the troll's carnage. The scenery in the film is lovely and the re-told version of this legend is well done.

2551374,1,B000F4PD7G,"If you have any love for Seamus Heaney's recent translation of the Beowulf epic saga, for action movies or for the core tenets of the western warrior ethic then DON'T watch this movie. It will break your heart at its misrepresentation of its primary source and in its mean spirited attack on the early roots of the Northern European cultures. When ""Brother Where Art Thou"" came out the authors claimed that it was based on the Odyssey. That movie was so far removed from anything to do with the Odyssey that you could ignore that piece of post modern conceit and enjoy a uniquely told tale. This movie cannot be ignored for what it is - a deliberate revision of the saga to make traditional heroism and warrior spirit seem lost, confused, helpless and deserving of extinction.

The movie's themes are a complete rejection of the core values and actions of the characters in the saga and the themes that have replaced it are designed to ridicule the traditional heroes and laud the villains of the piece. In this movie Beowulf can be an effective hero but is now ""confused"" as to whether he is on the side of ""right"" this time. Grendel's violence is only a reaction to violence perpetrated by the Dane King, Hrothgar - so we have the Europeans favorite theme- ""the cycle of violence"" as the cause of the genocidal attacks of Grendel on the Danes. And the monster avoids the king and kills his people, so it really is an attack on all, not just the king. Oddly, the king's real error was in showing mercy to Grendel as a child so, as troubling as it seems, the movie supports the traditional European perspective that ethnic cleansing works - leave no survivors or you will pay. (Its nice to see an act of mercy to the child of a poacher result in the deaths of dozens of people who had nothing to do with the problem in the first place. Terrorism is your payment for existing is also a constant EU-like theme these days.)The King is a drunken, cowardly lout who is incompetent and a figure of ridicule, as are all authority figures in the post modern view. The main female character was forced into a life as a prostitute as an orphan but is also harboring the child of Grendel--who raped her but now protects her from those who would ""cut my throat"" although the village seems quite happy to have her around--so I am assuming this is because they WOULD kill her if they knew about the child. Earlier in the movie, the Queen offers the female sanctuary within the court but the character replies that ""We made our choices long ago"". Like any good movie viewer you think ""Ah, back story!"" Yet later we find that the female character has never made a single choice in any of this - raped as a child prostitute and raped and impregnated by Grendel. So that message is blurry to say the least. Grendel is not a troll - our confused and pensive hero asks ""What is a troll exactly?"" and in the movie it seems that Grendel, like both his father and his son are just really huge hairy guys who don't speak and look scary enough to be threatening. (The ""challenged"" and misunderstood outsider is the victim of mainstream cultural prejudice).Oddly, after Grendel impregnates the female character her hair begins to look as straggled as does Grendel and family--- sort of a bride of Frankenstein or Army of Darkness effect once you have been raped by the monster. Clearly, this element got completely away from the authors of the screen play. Equating prostitution and rape is not a bad idea, it's just interesting coming from a culture that so embraces ""entertainment worker visas"" for major sporting events. As for Beowulf--he is brave enough, but inept in fighting the monster and when the struggle finally takes place it is Grendel who cuts off his own arm to escape--and that confrontation only occurs  because Beowulf and his men desecrated Grendel's shrine to his dead father - the cycle of violence thing again. In the end, Grendel does die and Beowulf kills Grendel's mother with his sword. But then he also meets the hidden Grendel child and is basically mocked by the female character that the child will also exact revenge against Beowulf for the death of Grendel. (""So, Hrothgar taught you nothing."") Beowulf lets the kid and the Mother live. He must be counting on the distance between them because this story makes it clear-- once the revenge cycle has started they will come for you and no act of mercy or soulful looks or lame ""shrine"" to the homicidal martyr who just killed himself will keep you from getting your head bashed in.

There has been a GREAT deal of discussion, commentary and disagreement about the topic of the ""culture war"" between those who hold a respectful and traditionalist view of the main tenets of western civilization and those who disparage it. Often this issue seems overplayed and certainly serves as a political football. But sometimes you just trip over an example of the ""revision"" of a core western virtue or cultural frame of reference which not only denigrates the culture, but distorts it beyond all recognition. So it is with this terrible movie and the cowardly and dishonest cultural perspective that it promotes.( In passing, if you are interested in a masterful telling of this saga from Grendel's point of view, then find Grendel by John Gardner. Now that is the way to reverse a story without destroying its core principles. If you think I am over reacting to the post modern view of this saga, read Honor by James Bowman).",1168473600,44,5471,4.649793388429752

From the very beginning, we're led to sympathize with the 'monster', who was, we find out, in this director's view, created by his enemy.  Grendel and his father are attacked while on an outing - unprovoked.  Grendel learns to hate his enemy because they kill his father and he's bent on revenge ever since.  So, he's actually the good guy.  He's also a family man himself, all grown up and trying to raise his own child.  The movie was ok, and the acting quite good.

2551389,4,B000F4PD7G,"Not that there are many film versions of the Beowulf legend to choose from, but this recent adaptation by director Sturla Gunnarson is definitely worth a look.  Shot entirely on location in Iceland, this film offers a breathtaking look at the real world these characters would have inhabited.

And that very reality is precisely what gives this film its power.  Gunnarson takes the story of Beowulf almost entirely out of the realm of myth and places it as close to reality as one might without removing it from all relevance.  Beowulf as a character is already dealing with his growing reputation as a hero and monster-slayer, yet he remains a human man who must deal with a perceived superhuman nemesis.  The treatment of the monster Grendel is rather unique and one can even interpret his depiction as a throwback to neanderthal man or some other precursor or subsect of homo-sapien evolution.  He is similar to a yeti or sasquatch, yet treated with dignity and allowed far more emotional depth and range than many would usually allow for such a creature.

Gunnarson obviously has been heavily influenced by John Gardner's Grendel, which retells the beowulf myth from the point of view of the monster.  Gunnarson remains as true to the story as possible considering the choices he makes in telling his version of the story.

The scenery of the film is nothing short of gorgeous and for those with a predisposition for the harsh stark landscapes of medieval Scandinavia this film will in no way disappoint.  The settings are kept minimal and efficient, as the cultures depicted would have practiced in reality.  There are no shining palaces of gold or massive castles on a hilltop.  This is not the Lord of the Rings.  It is however a truly magnificent movie about vikings and one of the rare few to boast such a mantle.

The only other recent film which bears comparison is John McTiernan's 13th Warrior, based on the novel Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton.  That film is likewise a retelling of the Beowulf myth but it goes in a completely alternate direction and suffers greatly from a profound lack of historical accuracy despite its attempt to appear 'plausible.'

The only questionable moments in Gunnarson's version are his depiction of the climactic fight between the hero and the monster (here it has been made deliberately anti-climactic) and also the way the relationships between Beowulf, the monster and the witch play out.

Stellar performances are turned in by almost all members of the cast, especially Stellan Skarsgrd as King Hrothgar and, of course, Gerard Butler as Beowulf himself.

For those just interested in a slick medieval action/thriller, check ou the local video store and give this one a look.  For more serious fans of medieval legend/myth/folklore or especially avid buffs of the Beowulf legend itself, this one is worth the money. Buy it.",1167868800,3,2879,4.923395445134576

Beowulf needs a script that elevates the hero, his actions, one that could have played on the language of fear, the heart of Beowulf....the movie falls apart without excellent dialogue, where its most needed- character revelation.

Young filmmakers, as well as old, experimenting with all sorts of ""storytelling/showing techniques"", such as non-linear, and ""scant dialogue"" styles, should remember that to be human is to feel, and to speak. We don't know what a character is thinking (usually) on screen, so... while ""action speaks louder than words"", it is often refreshing, and just as exciting, to hear great battles with words, sparring dialogue, mince-meat, rapier-sharp word-play -- be it witty, cutting, or profound.

Beowulf & Grendel lacks a heart, and the soul of humans confronting fear, and the unknown...in this terror-filled story-- Once again, a classic is butchered.

In this retelling Grendel is no monster and Beowulf learns the enemies he has slaughtered as the hero of the Geats had names, friends and he learns that his life is uncomfortably similar to those lesser individuals that cross his path.  If you like movies like Blade Runner where the point of the movie wasn't for the hero to slaughter his enemies but was for the hero to question, learn and grow then this movie will appeal to you.

I suspect the primary group of folks who will hate the movie will be those biblical scholarly types who have been trying to reinterpret this story to somehow have something to do with christianity.  The movie takes a poke at that (the mark of Cain thing) that most will miss unless they know something about the ongoing attempts to say this was a christian inspired story when there is zero evidence to suggest it was anything other than the pagan story that it is.

2551411,2,B000F4PD7G,"Beowulf, is a heroic epic poem which has been orally transmitted through the ages finally written down by monks and retold again and again for its memorable battles and beloved heroes. Both Christians and Pagans alike have found in its 3,182 lines something to relate to and believe in, and many 9th graders have dreaded the pop quizzes it has generated for years.

This movie ""Beowulf and Grendel"" is just one In a long line of interpretations (there is an animated version in the same style as the Polar Express coming out in 2007) It stars Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera, Tomb Raider, 300) Stellan Skarsgard (Ronin, Amistad, Good Will Hunting) Tony Curran (Underworld 2, The Good German) and Sarah Polley (Dawn of the Dead, The Sweet Hereafter)

The movie starts out with King Hrothgar (Skarsgard) killing a troll for reasons unknown and leaving the trolls hairy little boy to live. The little boy chops his fathers head off , Mrs Vorhees style, and basically lives in a cave with it , sorta like Tom Hanks and the Volleyball in Castaway. A grown Grendel then waits till the good King erects a massive beer hall and then proceeds to massacre all the warriors and eat them. In the Poem, Grendel decides to kill them because they are just making too much noise and he was a hideous outcast who basically wasn't invited to the party. This is where the film starts taking on a story of its own, completely deviating from the historical poem entirely. Beowulf (Butler), who lives in Geatland, comes to King Hrothgars aide with a handful of braided warriors.

The king feigns cluelessness as to why Grendel is eating a Dane Buffet, so Beowulf turns to the local witch/wench. Selma (Polley) is an affront to the Beowulf legend, first of all Polley decides not to even have an accent, instead using her Canadian one. She can see your future death, she has red nappy hair, and she looks like she doesn't want to be there, Secondly there was no woman like her in the poem what so ever. Did they really need a love interest? She admits to being a prostitute, she can understand Grendels language of grunts, and she obviously thinks Beowulf is hot. Grendel doesn't want to kill Beowulf, because he hasn't been harmed by him and BW wants to know why he wants to hurt the King and his subjects, the king however will offer up no explanation. A Geat warrior (Curran) stomps on Grendels daddys head and then he gets peeved, comes to get him and ends up losing his arm (Just like in the Poem) and dies from the wound. Beowulf and his Peeps are then set upon by Grendels Mother. She is a sea hag; with some serious calve muscles, and Beowulf ends up killing her in her lair. There he finds a child guarding Grendels body, which we find out is Grendels child by Selma, they had a nice romantic grunting minute together years back. Beowulf honors Grendel as a warrior, gets his own time with Selma because who hasn't?, and leaves, which basically confused the crud out of me.

There is much more to the movie I realize, but why tell this tale and completely make up 99% of it to suite your needs? It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either. Between Selma's Non accent and Grendel feeling randy it lost its heroic beautiful meaning. Gerard Butler is an amazing actor, but he gets glossed over by badly choreographed fights, and a plotline so wierd it felt like a terrible SciFi channel mess.

2551413,3,B000F4PD7G,"The movie begins with a young Grendel watching his father get killed by a band of Danes over a stolen fish.  Leading the pack is the future King Hrothgar, who spares the boy.  Decades later and young Grendel has grown to become a giant of a man.  Emotionally, he has never matured since his father's death, but has become a vengeful spirit that prowls the Danish highlands and kills Danish men to avenge his father's death.  Words of these cruelties spread far and wide, and draw Beowulf there with 12 warriors.  They promise Hrothgar to rid the land of the beast.  For weeks they camp out at Hrothgar's village, taunted by the occasional sighting of Grendel.  Beowulf's men finally find Grendel's cave, and desecrate it.  This brings Grendel upon them the next night.  They capture him, but he cuts of his own arm to free himself.  Grendel makes it to the sea where he wades out to die and be carried away by his mother.  The mother then attacks the village.  Beowulf and company track down the mother and kill it in turn.

The plot is simple enough, now lets critique the other parts of the movie.  First the dialogue.  Most of the cast is Scandinavian, and speak English with various Scandinavian accents.  This increases the script's authenticity.  Unfortunately, half the dialogue is incomprehensible as the script has them speak something close to Old English.  What is worse is that the DVD does not come with English, or any other subtitles or captioning.

Next is the action scenes and ensuing special effects.  Being a movie of swords and monsters, and with star Gerard Butler having played numerous sword fighting roles, I came in with high expectations.  I was sorely disappointed.  The various warriors seem quite skilled swordfighters when fighting each other, but somehow become novices when fighting Grendel.  The latter seems quick enough to deflect and dodge all their blows, without any shield or weapon for himself!

Third, the cinematography is quite good.  From the ocean scenes to the snowy plains to the rocky shores; the settings portray a world of stark but dangerous beauty, mostly untouched and untamed by human civilization.

Last, the character portrayals ranged from average to above-average.  King Hrothgar seems a broken man, and plays the part well.  Beowulf is the eager warrior but reluctant hero.  He will make the sacrifices but disavow the glories... quite the combination.  Grendel himself seems a man possessed, alternating between episodes of childish imbecility, animal-like wrath, and a canny prey.  Unfortunately, the long hair, dreary clothes and funny accents make the rest of the characters all seem the same.  The worst portrayal was Grendel's mother.  How did Grendel's father ever mate with that beast!  She was over 7 feet tall and had webbed feet and hands.

Overall, an okay movie.  As this is the first movie version of the Beowulf epic, it seemed worth the time to watch it.",1166313600,2,2930,4.920245398773006

I did not appreciate Sturla Gunnarson's revisionist retelling of Beowulf. The epic tells of a hero who defeats the ultimate evil of his time. The film presents a confused, soft semi-hero who simply cannot decide whether Grendel is evil or only misunderstood. The epic describes Grendel as a ""demon from hell"", but the film portrays him as a misunderstood tragedy who only slaughters dozens of Danes basically because he is different and has been wronged by society. Give me a break. I think Hrothgar (in the film) accurately represents the original attitudes of the story of Beowulf. When Gerrard Butler (Beowulf) asks Hrothgar if someone had ever done something to hurt Grendel, Hrothgar explodes, ""Oh, come on, Beowulf! It's a f------ troll - maybe somebody looked at it the wrong way!""

Gunnarson should have dropped the Hollywood-esque warm, fuzzy overtones and simply told the timeless story of Beowulf and Grendel.",1165881600,,1100,5.038461538461538

The fade in, fade out was like a child filming with a video camera. The film was funny at times and mixed with gore. Like eating sweet and sour. Being a Gerard Butler fan I was distressed after watching this film. Why did he do this? Gerry Butler is an incredibly talented actor and made the most out of the poor lines and bad pony riding scenes. This unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like The Jury, Please or The Phantom of The Opera.

2551429,1,B000F4PD7G,"This is going to sound like an exaggeration...but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

I will admit that I didn't have high hopes for this film.  I mean, it didn't come out in theaters (at least in the U.S.), which is never a good sign, no movie store seems to have it in stock, and I read some pretty crippling reviews right here on good ol' Amazon.  But hey, I gave it a shot.  Boy, was that a mistake...

First of all, here's a quick synopsis: Years ago, King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard) killed a troll, but took pity on the troll's son, Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson), and left him alone.  Grendel, now full-grown, is seeking revenge on Hrothgar's kingdom.  Hearing of Hrothgar's plight, the fierce warrior Beowulf (Gerard Butler) comes to help the king kill Grendel.  Along the way Beowulf meets a witch/prostitute named Selma (Sarah Polley) and discovers that trolls have feelings too.

Now, we all know that Stellan Skarsgard and Gerard Butler are great actors, but in this movie they fumble with a halting and painfully corny script.  The script affects the acting, and the acting affects the film.

Secondly, though Sarah Polley is a lovely actress, she seems very misplaced in this film.  She's the ONLY character with an American accent and, in an age-old Anglo-Saxon myth, this is very, very out of place.  In addition, the small amount of weight that Gerard Butler has put on around the stomach area draws a little from his role as an unstoppable, highly-trained warrior.

The battle scenes are unnecessarily gory, with fake-looking and very blood-soaked limbs flying left and right.  They seem primitive compared to the battle scenes of other films.  The scene in which Beowulf fights Grendel's mother is especially bad - there's lots of shrieking and strobe-light-esque movements that seem almost comical in this day and age.

The only things that can be said in this movie's defense are that the sweeping Iceland landscapes are breathtaking and the Celtic monk (Eddie Marsan) is mildly-amusing in his efforts to convert everyone.

2551431,4,B000F4PD7G,"Beowulf and Grendel DVD- First, let me state, that I liked this movie, four out of five stars.  If I had paid attention to all the reviews, I would not have purchased this.  However, I enjoyed this movie immensely.

Now, let me give you some pointers that will help you decide if this movie is for you: 1.)  It will help in your enjoyment of the movie, if you have read Beowulf.  2.)Also, if you have some knowledge and enjoy reading Norse myth, this will increase your enjoyment of the picture.  3.) If you can understand that animals use urination as a method to mark territory.  This is the point of the scene at the meet hall in the movie, when they show the troll urinating.  It is also used to embarrass the heroes.

I don't know if I agree with the portrayal of the troll as a sort of Neanderthal cave dweller, but I understand why they did it.  They did it so they could show Beowulf, one step up on the evolutionary ladder.  I also agree with their decision to use comprehensible English.  This opens up the movie to a much wider audience.

My favorite character in the movie was Selma, played by Sarah Polley.  She was the moral conscience of the film.

They filmed, the movie in Iceland, under extremely hard conditions for the filmmakers.  The audience can see this in the featurette in the DVD extras, and on the commentary track, for those of you that listen to such things.  The filmmakers have also included deleted scenes in the special features on the DVD.  They are interesting, if not informative.",1162425600,5,1517,4.474452554744525
2551432,4,B000F4PD7G,"Taking from the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf, Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarsson pulls the broad poem down into a successful two-hour film filled with heroes, warriors, monsters and love (everything you need in an epic, right?).

The Norse hero Beowulf (Gerard Butler, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, 2004) is called upon to aid King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST), Lord of the Danes, in his bloody battle against a massive troll named Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson, K-19: THE WIDOWMAKER). But once within King Hrothgar's realm, Beowulf discovers much more than just a deadly troll.

Grendel kills only the strong men, and is selective even then, for his wrath is one of vengeance. King Hrothgar and his kin killed Grendel's father years ago, and now the troll is bent on revenge. Beowulf is initially unaware of Grendel's grudge, but our ""hero"" warrior soon learns of it via the beautiful but dangerous witch, Selma (Sarah Polley, DON'T COME KNOCKING).

That Beowulf is battling a hero status he doesn't feel deserving of is also observed throughout the film. The additional battles of the many gods now in danger of falling to ""the one God"" (Christianity) is also touched on, for King Hrothgar and his clan feel that the many gods have abandoned them and perhaps this new God will help protect them.

That Grendel is not just a monster but a flesh and blood being is quickly sensed as we watch his father killed for no particular reason, and experience the anguish of his isolation from the world (he plays a type of bowling game with skulls for entertainment). Even his need to procreate is vividly portrayed as he pays a nighttime visit to Selma's home.

So when the end comes for Grendel, it is surprising, touching, bloody, and brutal. That Beowulf is forced to use his deadly warrior skills only adds to the terribleness of the deed that needed to be done.

Filmed entirely in Iceland -- complete with stubby Icelandic horses -- the film's panoramic views of the stunningly beautiful countryside contributes to the rounding out of the story. Lengthy waterfalls, green hillocks, and bizarre stone formations are all incorporated through the camera lens, giving the entire production an otherworldly feel.

Any faults are directed at the initial rushing of the story during the first 30 minutes, and the deep brogues by some actors/actresses that make it tough, at times, to understand what is being said.

But all-in-all the story is pulled off exceptionally well.",1161907200,3,2508,4.997601918465228

2551440,4,B000F4PD7G,"This movie is a visual masterpiece. The cinematography deserves an award.

I also liked that the story was told not as a simple hero tale but as an exploration of the origins of enmity, the consequences of our actions, and the fruits of vengeance.

Some reviewers have complained that the rough language is anacronistic for Dark Age Europe; I beg to differ. Most of the curse words we currently use are of Dark Age/Mediaeval origin, although some of them were not necessarily as stigmatized as they are today. Anyone reading Shakespeare will come across them, too. Such words are perfectly scripted for these warriors and heroes, and, yes, the Queen, as well.

I'll admit, the accents did throw me off a little; but honestly, a Scottish accent is not really very far removed from Scandinavian - they have common heritage and an ancient history of intermarriage and intertrade. As for the American actress Sarah Polley as the witch, it did seem a bit anacronistic, but accents really don't signify much of anything, especially when we're talking about accents none of us were around to hear. Beowulf was a Geat and Hrothgar a Dane, so it's right that their accents differed. And the witch was neither Geat nor Dane, so it's also right that her accent differ from them both.

The departure from the details of the ""original"" epic does not bother me. I'm not a literary purist, and I believe a living story is a story that can be adapted and retold as the storyteller sees fit. After all, that's how the tale was told by the Northern skalds in the years before it was written down in one form and petrified. And the heathen tradition in which Beowulf is firmly rooted (despite Christian overlays) is indeed a living one.

The fact that the movie does not include Beowulf's later exploits is not a defect; it is the reason the movie is called ""Beowulf and Grendel"", as the focus is on that particular episode in the hero's life, and in particular on the nature of the relationship between the two titular characters. That is also why Grendel's mother is given rather short shrift; she is peripheral to the subject of the film.

One reviewer complained that Hrothgar's hall was shown as ""old and delapidated"" - obviously he was not watching very closely. The hall is brand new. In fact, the first time we see it is in the blessing ceremony for opening the newly-constucted hall. This would seem to be a major factor in Grendel's violent rampage: the Danes have moved into new territory and created a mead-hall and township on the border of Grendel's land... land that used to be on the distant outskirts of the kingdom, between Danish civilization and the trolls' wilderness (hence the original run-in with Grendel's dad). The Danes' expanding territory and capital-relocation now creates the circumstances of their demise at the hands of the troll, who previously dared not venture into Daneland to take his revenge but sat nursing his hatred for the intervening years. Had the Danes not built their new town in that location, the ensuing tragedy might never have occurred.

Now, whether the hall was ""great and mighty, full of splendor and ancestral awe"" is certainly a subjective judgement. To the Northmen, their halls were great and splendid indeed; but to the Romans, and most of us, they were rude and primitive. It's all a matter of perspective.

So, with these things explained, I think this is a stunning, spectacular piece of cinema, which may require a couple of viewings to grasp all the details (especially for Americans who seem to have a lot of trouble with foreign accents). It is not light viewing. It has a lot of depth and complexity. It is challenging and intelligent. And to some, it's part of a sacred tradition.

Good job, Sturla!!!",1161216000,5,3751,4.776234567901234
2551441,3,B000F4PD7G,"Overall, this is a good film if you consider it as a stand-alone work concerning Dark Age Europe. Relative to the Beowulf poem/mythos, however, it takes grand creative license with the story. Essentially the story is there, but the filmmakers spend way too much time shoe-horning the fictional Selma into the story as a love interest for Beowulf. There is no such character in the original poem, and her inclusion in the film comes across as a typical Hollywood manuever (despite the fact that it's an Icelandic film) to appeal to female viewers (the few that might be watching). So much of the story is dedicated to forcing Selma into the story that the mythos as a whole suffers. Worst of all is the part where Grendel sneaks into her dwelling one night via flashback and ""has his way"" with her, the result of which is a half-troll/half-human child that's just perfect for the obligatory sequel-setup ending (yet another Hollywood tradition).

Portraying Grendel as a troll and not some fanged demonic beast from Hell was a good choice on the part of the filmmakers, considering how recent scholarly research suggests that he may have originated in earlier troll legends from Scandinavia. But the inclusion of his troll father murdered by King Hrothgar (something else not mentioned in the poem) serves as the standard vengeance motivation, and Grendel's sea-hag mother is poorly portrayed and used to minimal effect, with minimal screen-time as well. In particular, the battle between Beowulf and Grendel's mother comes across as spur-of-the-moment and rather anti-climactic, which is worsened by the suggestion that Beowulf haphazardly grabs a sword from a nearby pile of gold and treasure instead of coming prepared with his own sword (the poem tells extensively of his sword, called Hrunting or Nagling, by varying accounts, and also of the giant's sword he took from the hoard and used against her after his own blade was broken).

Let's not forget the fact that the dragon that Beowulf battles toward the end of the poem makes no appearance in the film at all. Nor do we see Beowulf's death, burial or any of the remaining incidents that tell the entire story.

Cinematically speaking, the film makes excellent use of the Icelandic landscape, which is truly beautiful, but there are no forests as described in the poem (Iceland lacks such wooded regions). Production is top-notch, and the costumes are well rendered also. To the film's credit, all of the horses in the film are Icelandic horses, the last remaining pure-bloodline of the original Scandinavian horses used by the Norseman, which they brought to Iceland when they began colonizing. The Scandinavian horses eventually died out on the European mainland, of which the Icelandic horses are directly descended.

Regrettably, however, Hrothgar's hall Heorot is shown to be an old and dilapidated structure in terrible need of repair, and not the great and mighty hall that the poem tells us it was, full of splendour and ancestral awe.

As stated above, as a Dark Age tale set in Europe of the deep-rooted past, the film is good. But if you're wanting to see a genuine movie about Beowulf, Grendel, Grendel's mother, the dragon, King Hrothgar, Wyglaf, Ectheow or anything/anyone else relative to the Beowulf mythos, you must do as we've done for centuries: Go to the source material, the original poem.",1160956800,3,3368,5.007142857142857

Stellan Skarsgard does an excellent job in his role of Hrothgar, the Dane king whose spirit is beaten and broken by the depradations of a vengeful Grendel.  I am a huge fan of Gerard Butler, and enjoyed watching how he  fleshed out the character of Beowulf, giving him far more dimension than the rather stilted script offered.

I think that is what I disliked about this movie.  Most of the characters never achieved the level of credibility needed due to the stilted, and sometimes awkward dialogue, which ranged from poetic to middle-school boy's bathroom.

2551443,3,B000F4PD7G,"This movie is rated R for good reason.  While I have no issue with the R rating, the saga was never like this.

I want to start off by saying this is an adaptation of the book, it is by no means the story as told in the book.  The move is sold as a ""modern adaptation"" of the book.

It is filmed in Iceland.  To be honest, the scenery is lovely, and sets the story well.  Costumes - I'm mixed on this.  Some look appropriate, others look a bit out of place.  The accents also struck me as wrong.  Sorry, this is a hodgepodge of accents, ranging from Canadian to Scottish, to English to Norse inflections.  No one seemed to be on the same page with this.

I am not familiar with any of the cast.  The director is Sturla Gunnarsson, who's credits include everything from Da Vinci documentaries to Ricky Nelson.  Beowulf  is Girard Butler, probably most recognizable from his role in the 2004 production of ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  Grendel is played by Ingvar Sigurdsson, and I did not recognize any of his film credits.  But familiarity with the cast is not as necessary as familiarity with the saga, as you will be challenged in that respect.

But on to the actual film.  The scenery in Iceland is barren and mysterious, as is this movie.  It is a very violent film, taking us very visually into the slaughter perpetrated by the Grendel.  This movie is presented as coarse in it's approach and it's language.  We are given barbarians as interpreted by the writer Andrew Rai Berzins and the director.  This movie presents us with a very raw and unrefined version of Beowulf.  Some of the dialogue I felt is, well, off.  The language used is not of the time period but modern.  And while they were a randy bunch of barbarians, the life style was overemphasized, in my opinion.  Too many parties, not enough story.

Overall these elements gave this movie more of a modern slasher feeling than the classic epic I was expecting.  Maybe too much modernization can spoil the feel of a classic masterpiece.  I was left feeling disappointed rather than entertained and exuberant at the conclusion of the film.  I was looking for Beowulf and Grendel, I saw an SCA reinactment in a Friday night drive-in B movie special.

The acting is... convincing - the actors get into their parts.  But again, I was hard pressed sometimes to locate the original story amongst the various interpretations and modern trappings included in the film.

Hollywood in Iceland.  Their interpretation, their idea of what the story is about and while interesting, not entertaining.  I do not recommend this for young kids, and you really do need to take this as the modern interpretation it is intended.  Overall, I found it - interesting.  medievalcrusadesbabe",1160265600,9,2730,4.635983263598327
2551444,3,B000F4PD7G,"I am well aquainted with the original, which I had to read in college. This movie was alot better than I had expected. I approve of most of the story changes. I think it was smart to make Grendel an oversized Neanderthal-like beast. It gave the story a much needed emotional kick. The way the director portrays the spread of Christianity into Northern Europe was a very wise decision. The Icelandic scenery was stunning. Most of the acting was on the mark.

However, the choice to give an American accent to the witch while every other character has an English/Scottish accent was stupid. How a person comes to a completely idiotic decision like that I will never know. Also, the sex scene between the witch and Grendel was NOT needed. Her acting is terrible. I was seriously gritting my teeth every time her ugly face appeared on my screen. When Grendel comes to rape her, she doesn't make a noise. Now I'm not a lady, but if a 7 foot Neanderthal comes to my bedroom to slip me some caveman sausage, I'm gonna scream, cry, and attempt to fight back until I start liking it. Bad directing! Bad acting!

Also, was the f word really necessary for a medieval pic?

Other than that, I really liked this movie. It was well made for a relatively small budget (relative, that is, to most Hollywood shlock). As much as I am fond of this retelling, I'm not sure that someone who is unacquainted with the original would appreciate it as much.",1160092800,7,1432,4.521235521235521
2551445,4,B000F4PD7G,"BEOWULF & GRENDEL as the title of this wonderfully atmospheric retelling of the myth is well selected: the usual name of the myth is simply BEOWULF but Sturla Gunnarsson, with the aid of screenwriter Andrew Rai Berzins,  appreciates the importance of the 'creature' Grendel and gives him equal billing.  Not all audiences will agree with the decision to make Grendel 'humanized' (he was actually a giant troll monster in the original tale), but the manner in which this story is related makes this concept of Grendel as a being with memory and feelings more pertinent to contemporary audiences.

King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgrd) once killed a troll whose son Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigursson) survived and has been vengefully killing the Danish court of the king to the point that the king has lost all power.  A monk, Brendan the Celt (Eddie Marsan), comes to Denmark (the time is 400 AD) to spread Christianity, baptize the population and pray for the protection of the people form Grendel. King Hrothgar calls upon a Hero in the form of Beowulf (Gerard Butler) who travels the seas, only to be shipwrecked and come ashore with his few men to aid the decimated kingdom and king.  Once in Denmark, Beowulf strategizes his attack on Grendel, the mighty son of the original troll, survives the many attacks that leave many dead and torn limb from limb, and finally is responsible for ridding the land of Grendel.  Along the way Beowulf is aided by a witch Selma (Sarah Polley) who defends Grendel's philosophy: we later discover that she bore a child by Grendel.  After many chases and conflicts Beowulf is responsible for Grendel's death and the kingdom rejoices while Beowulf is conflicted by the fact that he has killed a troll with a heart and soul.  There are many metaphors between Christianity and mythology that are beautifully explored by the story as told here.

Filmed in Iceland and Canada the mythic mood of the tale is well served by cinematographer Jan Kiesser and the musical score by Hilmar &Ouml;rn Hilmarsson.  One is reminded of the paintings of Odd Nerdrum.  The stormy darkness of the entire film fits the story well and the actors, especially the always superb and charismatic Gerard Butler, make their characters as credible as myth allows.  The many accents of the actors make understanding the lines a problem and even though the dialogue is in English, subtitles would have greatly helped understanding the storyline as it unfolds.

Many people will object to the character of Grendel as extracted here from the original myth, but for this observer the way in which we are allowed to understand the motivation of this rather pitiful beast makes the story far more poignant.  The added features on the DVD include  Gerard Butler discussing his role and his decision to accept the Beowulf persona.  And equally as interesting is a behind the scenes track that demonstrates the difficulties in filming a story in rugged terrain.

 Finally, someone does a respectable interpretation of one of the most important pieces of Western European literature!  If you can get past Beowulf's witch Selma's respective Scottish and American accents, as well as some modern turns of phrase in the Danish dialogue, then raise your flagon of beer up high, for the rest of the film will be clear sailing.  Those who had to read this epic in school (and who didn't??), and those who actually read it in Middle English for enjoyment in college (like myself  . . . ) will be grateful to know that the film is pretty faithful to the book.  Ok, there is the witch, but they weren't really that uncommon back then.  Most of them pretty much were outcasts who lived on the fringes of a community anyhow--although few were probably as desirable as Selma.  There is also some revisionism going on, most particularly with Grendel-and it is here that director Gunnarsson can't be praised enough.  Through Grendel we have the conflux of monster/hero, myth, truth, and the legend that gets made from truth, even while the truth is unfolding at the moment--watch the bard in the movie and you'll see.  There is also some nice historical background that mattes the picture-you can see how the blood oath/vengeance shaped much of that culture for the time; the first inroads Christianity was making into Scandinavia; and some references to parallel historical threads, namely Clovis of the Franks.  My only criticism is of not including the final part of Beowulf's life.  It would have been nice to have seen this part because it is in a way more political and true to life--an exceptional charismatic figure holds a kingdom together by force of will and then the kingdom disintegrates upon his death; that and there was a good dragon fight as well, but that's another story for another time.  The extras respectable.  I liked the one deleted scene of the Christian priest ranting at the Danes as he's sailing into their community to Christianize them.  A final thank you should go to Anchor Bay for continually turning out some fine DVDs of some of the most obscure past films past and some great mainstream films that somehow would have fallen through the cracks of being released.",1159488000,2,2229,4.813648293963254

However, do not watch this looking for a faithful adaptation of Beowulf, the epic poem.  With the additions of new characters (Selma) and new motives for Grendel, this movie fails to provide anywhere near the themes and spirit of the original poem.

2551453,5,B000F4PD7G,"""Beowulf and Grendel"" is a terrific movie, taken by itself without judging it against the Old English poem. I am an English graduate student with a special interest in Old English, so I am quite familar with the epic. There are many points where the movie deviates from its source material (the inclusion of the character Selma, the omission of the final battle with the dragon, et cetera). Beyond these concrete differences, there are some less obvious, and deeper differences. This movie has an agenda, and is uncomfortable with the simple good and simple evil presented in the poem. Grendel is given justification, and he is presented as a humane (and almost human) character, who is just as deserving of our pity as Gollum is in the Lord of the Rings.

Beowulf begins to question the motives of Hrothgar, and becomes somewhat disillusioned with the hero myths that begin to surround him. In short, this movie is Beowulf for the modern era, as we expect complex characters with varying degrees of motivation and ambiguity. Enjoy this movie for what it is, and not for what it lacks. If anything, this film may make viewers want to read the epic poem, and that can only be a good thing.

As a side note, this movie actually contains *quite* a bit of profanity. I am unsure why this is added; it may be to eliminate some of the distance between modern viewers and the early medieval period, or it may simply be an attempt to convey the rugged and harsh conditions of the period.",1159315200,7,1479,4.641221374045801

Clumsily edited, terrible makeup (especially all the rubber Grendel body-suits), no closeups of actors (there are about 10 actors in the whole ""epic"" movie), and that's not even mentioning the accents, which are all over the map. Sarah Polley sounds like she's straight out of the mall, while Butler is unintelligable half the time.

2551458,2,B000F4PD7G,"I certainly take my hat off the the cast for living through the shooting of this one: one message this film gets across big style is that Iceland is mind-buggeringly cold, inhospitable place, and that's just in the Autumn. Sadly, however, Gerard Butler and company's sacrifice in wading through mud, icy rivers and horizontal sleet is spent all in the name of ... well, if truth be told, a fairly humdrum sword and sorcery treatment.

Gunnarson describes Beowulf as the oldest piece of literature in the English language, and it's a pity he didn't leave it well alone (there's a good reason literature survives 1500 years). Instead, the script undermines the linear hero myth which Beowulf helped create - a straight fight between good and evil - by giving Grendel a moral basis, namely vengeance for the Danes' killing of his father. In the original, Grendel was simply angered by the Danes' loud and boozy singing! Butler's Beowulf is converted, therefore, into a confused and decidely post modern sort of a hero, one who isn't really sure who he's fighting, why, or what the hell is really going on. I don't think this was a particularly smart variation from the original plot.

Save for the airfares to Iceland, the budget is staggeringly low: the cast seems to number about eight (then again, it's quite conceivable the remainder fled to the airport after the first day of principal photography), and are obliged to gallivant around on undoubtedly hardy but all the same squat little Icelandic ponies; this equine inadequacy, together with several other establishing and action shots, calling unfortunately to mind Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

Whilst given the conditions I suppose they could hardly be blamed, there is still a marked reluctance to indulge in second takes, to the point where at least one take of a combatant beginning to bleed before being stabbed and a take of Hrothgar's queen attempting to storm icily off, only to stumble clumsily over some tussock, make the final edit of the film.

Nor are make up, special effects or editing much to write home about: action scenes are clumsily cut and gore and clearly rubber limbs, heads etc. are unconvincingly sprayed around, particularly towards the end.

There are some positives: the scenery is certainly momentous and moody, and Gerard Butler is a charismatic and convincing lead, but all in all it isn't surprising this one didn't take off at the box office, and in the final analysis the fact I had to order the DVD from Amazon Canada (it being an Icelanding-Canadian co-production), with neither the US nor the UK carrying the film, kind of figures.

2551459,5,B000F4PD7G,"This was a very good movie. Beautifully shot, beautifully scripted, and beautifully performed, but does not follow the true story of Beowulf and Grendel.

Having read the actual Beowulf in high school I was pretty psyched to see this new adaption of the classic story, but did get a disapointment when it did not follow the story. BUT I did still get a huge enjoyment out of this movie. It had many, many similarities to the original story and had pretty much the same storyline, it just had  some additional characters and the death of Grendel was different in the film. I do think a little more could have been explained in the movie, like the Sea Hag (Grendel's mother). If I had not read the original Beowulf, I would have had no idea who she was or why she was so upset over Grendel's death. I also didn't see the point in adding the character of Selma to the film. Her only purpose was to have a sex scene in the film. But I did think it was cool how they made Grendel have a son and have the same situation occur with Beowulf and Grendel's son as it happened with Hrothgar and Grendel. A very interesting, entertaining, and funny new outlook to this classic story. Excellent performances by Gerard Butler (as Beowulf), Stellan Skarsgsrd (as King Hrothger), and Invar Eggert Sigurosson (as Grendel). Also, some extremely beautiful shots of Iceland.

Before the tale was told around a campfire about a hero named Beowulf and the monsters he defeated, there was a man, a warrior who lived and died. How did his story, handed down for generations in an oral tradition actually happen? The writer, director, cast and crew try to bring the man before there was a legend to life. They succeed largely as a result of the acting skills of Butler, Skarsgrd, and Sigursson. Butler is a thinking-man's warrior who gets caught in a web of promises and deceit. As comprehension dawns, it is too late for Beowulf to save anyone -- the story must play out to an ending filled with revenge and death. The scenery is great; Iceland is breathtaking, the vistas even threaten to overwhelm the players and act as a dominant character in this beautifully shot movie.

2551462,5,B000F4PD7G,"I bought the DVD of Beowulf and Grendel recently and it is a wonderful film - each time I watch it I find something else to appreciate.

The poem in its original English is quite difficult to understand,even for college students,and can be pretty heavy going. i suggest you read the Rosemary Sutcliff book 'Beowulf:Dragonslayer' which tells the story simply in beautiful language and shares many details with this movie. It also fills in the background and follows up what happens to Beowulf in later life.

No doubt the animated film 'Beowulf' with its bigger budget and special effects which is due out next year, will stick to the simplistic 'good versus evil' mystical tale. Impressive but not as intersting as 'Beowulf and Grendel's attempt to show what could have been the original basis for the legend before it was adapted and sanitised by Christian monks.

I don't see anything wrong with introducing a female character,Selma,or a Christian missionary monk,Brendan,to the mix - it all adds to the story.

And the humour in the film is unexpected and welcome.

Thorkel,the Geat poet/narrator, is constantly exagerating his leader's exploits and Beowulf has to tell him to tone it down - he is a great warrior and fighter,yes,but still only a man.

Much has been said criticising the swearing in 'Beowulf and Grendel',but there really isn't all that much - nothing like 'Deadwood' or 'Sopranos' for instance. And as the director and writer explain in their commentary,when a group of guys get together their language is salty! Four letter swear words used nowadays are actually very old (Anglo Saxon) and are therefore not out of place in this film. The F word originally meant plowing and sowing seed, and the C word was simply the name for a particular part of the female anatomy. Selma uses it matter of factly when asking Beowulf if he wants her and when he doesnt respond she teasingly calls him a warrior monk.

The cast are excellent especially Stellan Skarsgard and Gerry Butler who is Beowulf personified,showing his feelings in his eyes and bodylanguage and with beautiful tangled locks of hair.

The Icelandic scenery is wonderful and has so many moods.

I wholeheartedly recommend this film. Watch it with an open mind and just enjoy the tale.

It's not meant to be a blockbuster with lots of special effects,nor is it a reenactment of the original manuscript.

There was plenty of action and peril but there was something more.  The hero did not go blindly into the fight but questioned why there was a fight in the first place.  The 'monster' was not clearly evil, he had motives for his actions.

I had a feeling of people huddled together against the dangers in the dark, seeking safety while sending the young and bold to fight the danger.  It was a story of the circle of revenge and a question at the end, Can this circle ever be broken?

Gerard Butler is perfectly cast as the strong, brave and questioning Beowulf.  He is a natural leader and hero.  I also thought that Stellan Skarsgard and Ingvar Sigurdsson gave wonderful performances.  I am on the fence about Sarah Polley.  I understood her position and her motives but there were times she left me cold.  On the whole,  this cast including Beowulf's comrades in arms, took me on this quest, the journey of questions that maybe have no answers, only hope.  What more could I ask for.

2551467,1,B000F4PD7G,"As an adaptation of the original work it is terrible. What survives of the epic poem is merely the shell. The setting, costumes, and art direction are very good. However, that shell is then filled with the heavy-handed sensibilities of ""Perhaps Man is the Real Monster"" and ""Can't we all Just Get Along?"" These ideas are driven home with all the subtlety of a grade-school finger painting. They are neither original, nor particularly thought-provoking in this film. It becomes tiresome, over the film's two hours, to watch the character of Beowulf slowly come to the conclusion that we are presented with in the first segment of the movie.

I will also say that by shoving that particular message down the film's throat, only to have it be regurgitated back upon the viewer, does injustice to the orginal work.

There are huge chunks of the film that go nowhere. There are entire scenes that could have been cut that never would have been missed. It's a repetitive and unentertaining film.

There is even very little 'epic' about it. The final confrontation between Beowulf and Grendel, an important part of the original work, is a let down. It seems to me that the idea of Beowulf being, in any respect that we can see, a 'hero' was put aside to demonstrate that, oh gee, Grendel is just misunderstood, the poor guy.

Barely anything happens through this entire movie. I am not kidding. Wait, oh yeah, the troll gets laid. That's about it.

The DVD's special features are thoroughly fascinating, and a wonderful surprise.

Shot entirely on location in the severe beauty of Iceland and without computerized effects, this film presents an old story with the feel of the local news--it could be taking place right now. In places humorous, in others grim, in all places compelling, this film is a splendid example of how legends get started.

This film is brilliant. Perfect for our cynical age, its realism and shades-of-gray storyline makes one stop and think. It has greater echoes of racism, ethnocentrism, and media hype, appropriate for a time when we are bombarded with images of blood and gore in centuries-old conflicts.

The language deserves a sentence of its own; smartly, it's modern, with a variety of accents. The writer wisely gives us what real people would say, without overdoing the profanity.

This story in the original tradition places a different slant on the tale while holding close to the original. If told verbatim this would be a twenty minute movie so some of the information was filled in from inference. The ending has been changed to pose a new question and allow for a possible sequel.

The Dane King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgrd) crosses paths with a troll (instead of some Harry Potter or Shreck type creature this is more of a Neanderthal) who had the audacity to steal a fish. That is a killing offence. Unfortunately after the troll is dispatched Hrothgar realizes he left a trollet behind. Through an act of kindness or for some other reason he lets the little Grendel (Hringur Ingvarsson) survive. Now grown up Grendel (Ingvar E. Sigurdsson. Actually two actors) as required by tradition takes revenge on Danes.

With out knowing the facts the Geet hero Beowulf (Gerard Butler,) (twelve years later, even though they are a day's sail away) hears about King Hrothgar plight and takes his men to the rescue. There he meets a distraught King, a mad monk, a witchy woman and an illusive and cunning Grendel.

One thing that gives the film worth is that Grendel may be strong but mortal and Beowulf is not as strong as 30 men; this makes the tale more like something that could have really happened and turned into a myth.
