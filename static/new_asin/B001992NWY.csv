3426951,5,B001992NWY,I loved this show. It really made you rethink some long standing-long taught religious ideals.  It raised some excellent questions. I was sorry it was cut short before it addressed or answered some of those interesting ideas. The dynamics between Peter Horton and John Glover were excellent and I loved all the barbs and word play between them. I can't wait for it to be released on dvd as a collection and hope they include some insight as to why it was suddenly pulled and where they would have headed next!,1210896000,82,509,4.593406593406593

Occasionally it is shown on cable on SyFy or FX or one of those similar channels.  It was terrific and I was so disappointed when it got canceled.

3426978,5,B001992NWY,"I really love this show. It was exceptionally good for the 90's. Even better than most other shows from back then. I think it was every bit as good as the X-Files in quality entertainment.  I think it is still exceptionally good for today and deserves to be seen by a wider audience. I was really disappointed to see that Brimstone was not on DVD yet. That is a real shame, because this show really deserves to be on DVD and Blue Ray so that everyone can experience what an awesome show it is. If there is anyone out there reading all these highly positive reviews on Brimstone who can somehow bring this great show to DVD, please do so as soon as you can. I know I will buy it and so will many others. In fact, I would buy it as gifts for my close friends and family too. Everyone deserves as shot at seeing this great show.

This show really deserved more seasons too. The acting was phenomenal and every aspect of the show was intense and well devised. The plots were great and the special effects were excellent. The music was haunting and the direction perfect in every way. Why oh why has this show not been brought to DVD yet? I wish I knew, but I beg the powers that be to release it on DVD as soon as possible for everyone's enjoyment. Thanks.

It was it seems before its time,but it seems any kind of programme that gets you thinking, or enjoying or God forbid having brilliant writing,acting,cool photography and directing is instantly dismissed, and yet another pile of crap ""reality tv"" is added to the long far reaching taudry excuse for ""entertainment"" we have to put up with. Every now and again a small jewel pokes its head above the parapit of trash we have to endure, and before it's been given a chance in the televisual world some idiot or idiots at Fox in this case, because they don't see why people like it or it doesn't sell enough merchandise at the time, cancel it. To paraphrase a popular song there are 50,000 channels and sod all on, and as long as Television Moguls take no notice of sites like this and reviews on sites like TV.com,cheap mindless ""reality"" tv will rule.

3427005,5,B001992NWY,"Now that Smallville is over, let's get John Glover and Peter Horton back together and give this show the chance it deserved from the beginning. With the success of shows like Supernatural, Alphas and the Walking Dead (not to mention Angel and Buffy), things have changed in TV land. Brimstone was screwed from the get-go, playing on Friday nights when no-one was home. With DVRs and people watching online, it's criminal not to resurrect a brilliant idea like this. Kevin Smith sort-of tried with Reaper, but it was too slacker-silly, and lacked the wit of John Glover (or the amazing Mark Sheppard ""Crowley"" from Supernatural). Like Whedon's Firefly before it, this show was not given a chance, and I really think if enough of us get together, write scripts, overwhelm studios with emails, contact the talent, and put together coherent ideas for continuations, they might actually listen to us. Now that Joss Whedon has the respect of Hollywood (finally!) because of the Avengers, let's see a damned Buffy/Angel tie-in movie, too, and more Firefly.",1351468800,5,1049,5.0344827586206895

Fox, politely explained, it just wasn't as popular as they had hoped it would be. The byplay between Horton and Glover was classic. Glover should have won awards for his portrayal of the cruel, conniving and mischievous devil. I would hope the series would be released on DVD. I would purchased numerous copies and present them as gifts to those who never watched it. All those, I have spoken to, who have viewed some or all of the episodes, have nothing but high praise for the series. Recently, a Brimstone rip off ""Reaper"", was presented on TV, then cancelled.

3427034,5,B001992NWY,"I never understood why this show was axed after only a dozen episodes.  It must have been an internal dispute or a contract battle, because if it had been given half a chance it would have been HUGE.  The casting could hardly have been better and this might be the best TV adaptation of a comic ever.  The concept is novel if not entirely unique. (See: ""Spawn"", but with a much more modest special effects budget.)

This is one of a very, very (very) few TV series I would spend the money to own.  So what are you waiting for??",1311811200,2,527,4.23
3427035,5,B001992NWY,One of the best shows in the horror/supernatual genre. Too bad it was cut short. It's long over due for a dvd release.,1301529600,3,118,4.173913043478261
3427036,2,B001992NWY,"Humans have no proof where they go after death. Perhaps Charon, the ancient Greek ferryman, will require a coin for passage across the River Styx. Maybe the Vikings got it right, and mead and merriment await at Odin's table in Valhalla. We might open our eyes to discover that Anubis of the Egyptian pantheon already has our heart on the scale, ready to weigh against the feather of Truth.

Human afterlife might be a mystery, but we do know what happens when a television program bites the dust. The good ones get replicated on disk (a far more effective preservation than formaldehyde-filled veins) and encased in a box more lovely than a high-end casket. The cast and crew provide commentaries as heartfelt as funeral eulogies, and the series gains an immortality every time one of its disks is loaded in a DVD drive. The demise of a well-loved show can even inspire dedicated fans to flock to annual conventions where they worship story and cast.

Not so lucky are the series that fail to meet expectations. We do not mourn their passing, and their hereafter consists of an occasional marathon on a niche network that only insomniacs or the unemployed are likely to catch.

""Brimstone"" (1998-99) is one such show. The series hoped to follow Det. Ezekiel Stone (Peter Horton) as he retrieved 113 escapees from Hell--five years of work!--but met its demise after half a season. The short life of this program mirrors that of its main character. Before his death, Stone was a decorated New York City detective, but then he killed his wife's rapist and for this transgression finds himself sentenced to Hell and now in the Devil's employ. Like Stone, ""Brimstone"" has some praiseworthy characteristics, but the series also sins in ways that have earned it an inglorious afterlife of reruns on the horror network Chiller.

One factor in the plus column is a distinctive look. In the pilot, director/cinematographer Felix Enriquez Alcal reduces the glitz and glow of modern life to a grainy blue-gray, meant, perhaps, to capture how the now-dead Stone experiences the world of the still-living. In later episodes, when a strong color does make an appearance--a green pear or flowing red fabric--it emphasizes the symbol--a fresh start, for example, or a propensity for violence. The desaturation works well for New York City, where the series begins, but is less effective when Stone arrives in Los Angeles. We imagine that we are still in the cold, dreary Northeast (an idea reinforced by Stone's layered clothing) until we experience the disconnect of palm trees waving in the breeze.

Also to the series' credit is excellent casting. John Glover, for example, makes an especially good Devil. His hawk-like nose and swept-back hair evoke a bird of prey. These avian features--as well as the Devil's distaste for swearing and his use of angelic script in marking Stone's skin--are a nice homage to fallen angels Gabriel (Christopher Walken) and Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen) of ""The Prophecy"" (1995), a brilliant study of celestial beings gone bad. We enjoy the Devil's appearances, for he is witty and quick to share insight into the afterlife, but Glover tinges his character with just enough malice that we know better than to trust one word out of his mouth.

The Devil is, however, the wrong character for the series. Creative team Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris have diminished what should be a frightening figure by emphasizing his lack of power. The Devil should not be an incompetent unable to secure his own gates. We expect stupid humans like Pandora or the arrogant EPA agent in ""Ghostbusters"" to unleash evil on the world. When the Devil does choose to loose the damned, as Lucifer does in the ""Season of Mists"" storyline in Neil Gaiman's ""Sandman,"" his decision is well motivated, not a security lapse.

Better would have been a minor demon whose ineptitude had allowed the 113 sinners to escape. The audience could relate to an underling who, fearing his boss's punishment once the mistake is discovered, is scrambling to rectify the situation. And Stone should be smart enough to realize that regaining his life as a reward for the bounty hunting has no precedent in Christian mythology and likely not within the Devil's power.

At first, Horton seems a bad choice for the main character. He is too pretty. A man motivated to murder his wife's rapist should be pudgy and pockmarked, like Det. Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) of ""NYPD Blue."" We expect that level of rage and revenge from someone who won't tolerate harm to the beautiful woman who saw past his physical imperfections. But Horton sells his character, and we soon believe that Stone did love his wife more than the attention he got for his good looks and would go to extreme measures to avenge her violation.

The real problem with Stone's character is that he needs a partner--not necessarily another detective--to force viewers to consider different attitudes and perspectives. The series provides a number of contenders. Max (Lori Petty), the tech-savvy front desk clerk, would work, but the writers limit her contributions to wisecracks about Stone's shortcomings. Det. Sgt. Delilah Ash (Teri Polo) would have made an excellent Scully to Stone's Mulder, but the writers have other plans for her character (and expect the audience to swallow that Hell's denizens don't make a blip on one another's ""damned-dar""). Assistant DA Julia Trent (Michelle Forbes) could have provided a nice ""Law & Order"" cop-prosecutor balance to the program, especially if she insisted on applying what she considered superior human justice as Stone caught his bounties. When she and Det. Ash are sizing each other up in the courthouse hallway, we imagine an intriguing triangle developing as the two women compete to save an already damned dead man, blind to the fact that mistakes in their own lives might send them down his same path.

If Stone had a partner who was an atheist or non-Christian, the collision of cosmologies would have given the audience moments to consider the validity of each. Perhaps Horton, whose series work included ensemble dramas like ""thirtysomething,"" wanted the full focus on himself, but his lone perspective doesn't get viewers to question their assumptions or flirt with other world views, what should be a goal when a show deals with matters of religious faith.

Despite the lack of partner, some episodes do allow viewers to grapple with moral tangles. In ""Repentance,"" a Dutch SS officer responsible for Jewish deaths, tries to make amends protecting the homeless in present-day LA. Stone must still return him to Hell, even though he (and the audience) cry foul. Most episodes, however, have underdeveloped, simplistic plots: 1) The Devil appears with a cryptic clue about Stone's new quarry, 2) Stone investigates, surprising a suspect who flees, usually by shattering a window, 3) When Stone catches up, the two fight, but Stone manages to destroy the escapee's eyes, and 4) The soul, spinning and wailing, resembles a toilet flush of fireflies as it returns to Hell. The repetitive nature of the episodes make us feel we are watching ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"" Stone does have Shaggy's scruffiness, but again, where's Scooby?

Good television should create worlds that challenge us in ways our real lives do not. No one willingly wants to experience the desperation, violence, and poverty of Baltimore as it appears in ""The Wire"" or the unpredictability and primitive island conditions in ""Lost,"" but those shows ask us to imagine surviving--even succeeding--in harsh circumstances, and as we picture ourselves there, as we watch characters with our same qualities grow or fail, we gain insight into our own strengths and weaknesses.

""Brimstone,"" however, creates a world no one wants to visit, not even from the living room couch. If people really do get sent to Hell as punishment for their behavior in life, then God exists, but in one episode we watch the Divine Father allow a serial rapist to violate one woman after another--first in life and then after his return from death--but then reward the man who finally puts a stop to the abuse with eternal damnation. The Devil has pointed out that ""God's universe doesn't work like the American legal system,"" but where is our feel-good moment in that story? We conclude that this God must hate women, and there's enough misogyny in real life that we don't need to see it practiced by the Supreme Being on television. Better to watch ""The Wire"" or ""Lost"" where we can denounce the human failings of a corrupt government or secret society.

I can imagine FOX executives interested when the idea for this show was pitched. I can imagine those executives pleased by the look and unfolding events of the pilot and green-lighting the project. I can imagine them thinking that here, finally, was the new supernatural thriller to replace the exhausted story in ""The X-Files."" And ""Brimstone"" could have been that series. But, as so many of us do, it squandered its gifts--an intriguing idea, beautiful cinematography, and an excellent cast--on thoughtless development of character and story.",1298073600,,9128,5.008569545154911

The idea of a gang of damned souls tricking the devil and escaping hell for another life on earth is intriguing. So is the way this devil decides to get them back by using a damned detective to hunt them down,If one of them doesn't return him to hell first.
The best thing about the show is John Glover's devil. It's truly demonic the way he tortures his prisoner,The Prince Of Lies holding out the carrot of hope.

3427040,5,B001992NWY,"Well, the lead actors in this series are Peter Horton (who also produced the series) and John Glover. The main premise is that sometimes one can get a second chance, even if it is working for the devil. Horton, as the once Detective Ezekiel Stone, does an excellent job of portraying a basically good man who extracted vengeance (killed) on the man who raped his wife. A short time later Stone himself is killed in the line of duty and ends up in hell, where he stays for 15 years. Following an escape of 113 of Lucifer's worst ""customers"" Stone is recruited by the devil (John Glover) to go back to earth, sort of as Lucifer's bounty hunter, and track down the escaped ones and send them back to hell. If successful in getting all 113 of them, Stone will be rewarded by getting a ""second"" chance on earth, though Lucifer is forever showing up at unexpected or inopportune moments, and generally making things difficult for Stone. The acting by Horton and Glover (and their interactions) is really excellent! Too bad it only lasted one season.",1294012800,2,1043,4.612903225806452

3427063,5,B001992NWY,"Brimstone was a literate series. It was also a series based on spiritual themes. And it was dark, even in it's light moments. Even it's quirky moments had a shadow over them. Dark in color and film technique, and dark in themes. I mean, ""take the eyes and you take the soul""-- very gutsy work for a Friday night series. MILLENNIUM (another great series sorely treated by the suits) had just been taken out, as i recall, for similar crimes against the imagination.

  FOX could have had a thing going with the Freaky-Friday theme if they'd cared to throw a bone of support to their own shows. But they sent these brave soldiers out to die as examples. Now what have we got? MEDIUM and GHOST WHISPERER? Good little boys and girls who won't challenge the masses. GW is like TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL for wannabe Wiccans! C'mon! TV used to be the opiate-- now it's the depressant! Video Ambien! Then again, shows like MILLENNIUM and BRIMSTONE and DARK ANGEL (a rare cyberpunk offering-- the first since Max Headroom, i think) and other FOX castaways opened the doors for loads of other shows on other networks. So thanks, FOX! Your overlooked children have spawned lucrative revolutions elsewhere. Thanks for taking one for the team, yeah? I mean, Jessica Alba only has to blink to make money now, but that's thanks to you guys at FOX setting her free! You're so generous!
  You made your name in the late 80's as the rebellious new kid on the block and now you sacrifice your rebellious offspring to the future trends. Thats forward thinking at it's best! Wow!

  But i digress...There are intelligent people out here and alot of us are sick of cops and lawyers and doctors and reality-TV headcases. OK? Sacrifice Snookie to Baal, The God Of Crap. Just let us watch, yeah?

Whatever. My point is that Brimstone was a show that took your cop vs. badguy concept and threw in a bit of Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett's GOOD OMENS and a heaping helping of C.S. Lewis' THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS and gave us a show that existed beyond good and evil. It begged the questions that priests and preachers and scientists and atheists don't want us to ask about salvation and redemption and damnation and dogma and devils and angels and heaven and hell and how we fit into that whole complicated mess of supernatural politics. I think Dante himself might have enjoyed it. But then again, Dante wasn't part of a Nielson family.
I want this series reissued NOW! Please!

3427064,5,B001992NWY,"I originally started watching this show on the Chiller channel in syndication.  I have to say, out of the 10-12 episodes I have seen, this is a quality show.  Considering when it originally aired and even now, quality shows are hard to find.  Quite honestly, I'm suprized it only lasted one season.  For some reason, every time a series with this type of premise comes along, it is prematurely cancelled.  I guess most people are sensitive when it comes to issues of religion.  It's just a shame a quality show like this only lasted one season, meanwhile Seinfeld(which came along around the same time)lasted ten seasons.

I'm even more suprized that after 10-12 years after being cancelled, it still hasn't been released on DVD yet.  After reading the reviews here, it is apparent that most who have seen this show love it.  Hopefully, it will be released sometime in the foreseeable future....",1281484800,3,895,4.8355263157894735
3427065,5,B001992NWY,"I loved this show.  It was one of the best of the 1990's.  It was original and thought provoking. I was very unhappy with FOX for cancelling Brimstone.  It isn't like they had anything else even half as good.  I have most of the shows on VHS and would love a good quality set on DVD.
Update: I finally got a bootleg copy of this.  It isn't prefect, but it is all I can get right now.  My tapes were getting bad. I would still buy the set on DVD if TPTB would put it out.  I would even get another set for my Sis that also likes this type of shows.
Are all of you signed up to be notified if it is released.  It is sort of a way to vote for it's release.",1272153600,5,653,3.75
3427066,5,B001992NWY,I loved this show and was deeply disappointed when it was pulled early. We did not even get to see all the episodes that were made. If so many people wish to buy a product why don't the producers release it? Isn't Corporate greed the new American Way? If you want our money - give us what we want! PPLLEEAASSSE! I have waited for this show long enough.,1264464000,3,352,4.1911764705882355
3427067,5,B001992NWY,"I mean fer cryin' out loud, they're releasing one of the earliest short-lived Fox series, Werewolf, to DVD, so what's the frikkin' deal?!  The cancellation of this series STILL hurts and it's massively compounded by the lack of a DVD release.  This is the series that made me appreciate the talents of Peter Horton, and confirmed the delicious nefariousness of John Glover, who is in my humble THE best Satan EVAH!  The unsung star of the show, though, was the deeply moody look of it all, set forth by the brilliant director and co-exec producer Felix Alcala.  The tones were muted almost to the point of rendering the show black and white, but it gave the entire affair a spooky, mystical feel that I'd not seen before or since.  And of course the writing and acting were top-notch--does Fox ever cancel anything but the best? ;)  SO many lesser series that went on for years longer have their own DVD sets, and as I pointed out above, even other still-born Fox shows are getting their props, so who would it kill to FINALLY give us Brimstone?  Do we have to go to Hell--and bust out--to at last get a little love here?",1251244800,32,1121,4.51980198019802
3427068,5,B001992NWY,"Was this show to smart for the average joe viewer?  I think so.

A great mix of dark humor, fantasic writing and spot on acting sent Brimstone right over most of the nealson veiwers heads.

There is some people that watch TV with an IQ over 50.  Bring it back or at least put it on dvd",1246752000,14,285,3.9473684210526314
3427069,5,B001992NWY,"I first saw this show on SCI-FI channel.  Sadly, it only lasted a short season before cancellation

Brimstone was honest, witty, insightful, and intriguing.  The acting and writing were superb and the cinematography was somewhat unique at the time.

John Glover made an awesome Devil.  I saw elements of his performance here in Smallville as Lionel Luthor.  But this short lived show has lived on in my imagination as a wonderfully original piece of television.

Like ""Firefly,"" this show was dismantled before its time.",1241481600,21,520,5.119047619047619
3427070,5,B001992NWY,"My TV recorded VHS tapes are in danger of breaking.

For me, this show is a twisted, Faustian-style bargain that reminds me of the more devilish tales of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Mark Twain.

8272776,5,B001992NWY,"One of the most original TV series of all time.  The rapport between Peter Horton and John Glover was there right from the start.  Glover is EXCELLENT in his role as Satan. He looks like he's having a great time.

Why is this not on DVD yet?  Many many other very short lived TV series have made it to DVD and Blu-Ray.  What's the hold up here!",1453507200,3,344,4.074626865671642

I was intrigued by the world and characters and the dynamic that this show created and there was definitely more to see. Hated that it only lasted one season. I wish someone would have continued it as a novel series, or better yet as a graphic novel to see more. With all that Fox has currently available on DVD / Blue Ray, there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON why Brimstone should not be available on DVD. Just my two cents. For shame.",1453248000,2,507,4.347368421052631
