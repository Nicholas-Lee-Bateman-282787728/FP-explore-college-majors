2403581,5,B000B6N5VY,"Natalya Arkhipova and Irek Mukhamedov, are the ""Best of the Best"".  Their performance in this ballet was mesmerizing.  The supporting cast was also outstanding along with the fine accompainment by the orchestra.

Our entire family loves this DVD.  Especially our one year old granddaughter!!

Many thanks to the Bolshoi Ballet for this fantastic rendition.  They truly are the World's Best Ballet company!!!",1212192000,11,407,5.483870967741935
2403582,4,B000B6N5VY,"I am sorry to disagree with one of the reviewers, but I have a completely different view of this DVD. In the first place, the DVD box says the ballet lasts 101 minutes and the DVD actually does run for 101 minutes. If Amazon's review says it lasts 112 minues, then Amazon has made an error. This is no reason to blame the producers of the DVD.
  With regard to other areas of complaint, I did not find the video image to be very soft, I found no details missing, there was no excess video noise, there did not appear to be any time-acceleration in sound or performance, and there were no flickers light to dark. The only item about which I agree with the other reviewer is that the applause seems to be coming from some sort of echo chamber, but I did not buy the DVD for the applause. (You can easily avoid the applause by hitting the ""Next"" button on your remote to take you immediately to the next track.) This is not a Kultur video. (Unlike Kultur, this video gives you a beautiful brochure with information about the ballet and a track-by-track description of the dances in the ballet.) I bought two copies of this DVD, one of which I gave to my granddaughter because she loved it so much. I think the other reviewer got stuck with a defective copy and should return it for another one.
  I rate this DVD only four stars instead of five because I have two very small problems with the performance. In the first act, the boys try to annoy the girls with their trumpets. However, there is only one trumpet and no girls are around at the time except Clara. In addition, the boys are halfway across the stage from her. The second item is in the second act. In the Dance of the Mirlitons, two dancers are pulling a sheep on wheels. That part of the choreography leaves much to be desired. What happens if the sheep tips over? Luckily it didn't this time.
  All in all, however, this is a marvelous disc. To the best of my knowledge, it is one of few versions that play ALL of the music COMPLETE. There are NO cuts as there are in most ballet performances of most ballets. However, the Dance of the Mirlitons and Mother Cigogne are combined into one track, which is no big deal since they are played complete. On the positive side, there is no obnoxious ""ritardando"" and pause at the end of the Waltz of the Flowers as is found in so many other versions. The music simply flows naturally to the end of the dance.
  One of the very best ""character actors"" of ballet is Yuri Vetrov. He plays Drosselmeyer in this DVD. He is marvelous, as usual, and I especially love the way he lifts and moves the dolls (real people) around as if they actually WERE dolls.
  The Nutcracker is a children's ballet, so much fun to watch with gorgeous music and marvelous dancing, especially in the dances in the second act. This version is beautifully performed and should be at the top of your list.",1166745600,53,2879,4.364485981308412
2403583,1,B000B6N5VY,"This DVD received a 5 star review, yet upon close examination it has serious problems.

First, the transfer appears to have been from a mediocre video tape, yielding a very soft image - many details are missing especially in the dark scenes.

Second, the print has much video noise and often flickers light to dark.

Third and most serious, is the problem of the playback speed. The time is listed here as 112 minutes, yet my box says 101. It could be a typo mistake, but this DVD appears to have been time-accelerated. All the dancers and action appear to move too fast. Some movements are just blurs - very unnerving. If this frantic speed didn't make one dizzy it might have been funny instead. Unfortunately this flaw renders this performance mostly un-watchable for me.

The (accelerated) sound is OK, but the audience sounds as if they were either under water or on a cell phone.

My recommendation is to avoid this DVD and look for another Nutcracker. There is another DVD of this same Bolshoi production from a few years earlier which has problems of its own that is neither recommended.",1140480000,11,1095,4.682291666666667
2403584,5,B000B6N5VY,"I took my grand-daughter to see the San Jose Ballet do The Nutcracker, and was reminded of how much I liked it. I used to have the old Kirov version on tape, and I loved it, but it's gone, so I bought this Bolshoi version. I love it! I also bought the Baryshnikov version, and have to say that he's a great dancer, but definitely an inferior choreographer. This version is vastly superior (I gave the Baryshnikov away). I should add that this Bolshoi version is all about the dancing, and only slightly about child entertainment. But my grand-daughter wants to be a ballerina now (she's 2 3/4), so I think the dancing is what should matter most. Of course, the music and presentation are excellent.",1135900800,33,698,4.5476190476190474
2403585,5,B000B6N5VY,My 4 year-old is OBSESSED with the Nutcracker. This was her favorite gift under the Xmas tree this past Xmas. We have have seen almost every production available on DVD -- I kid you not -- that this has to be one of our favorites. My daughter is most interested in Clara and Arkhipova is a phenomenal Clara. My daughter's one complaint is that the nutcracker Clara dances with is a stuffed doll instead of a wooden nutcracker. We're willing to overlook this minor detail given the quality of the dancing. It is now August and we are still watching it.,1312502400,4,551,4.465346534653466
2403586,5,B000B6N5VY,"What makes a perfect Nutcracker?  In any ballet you should be able to see not only the dancers' entire bodies, but enough of the stage to appreciate the choreography and production design.  The story should be a version that you enjoy, or with enough variation and updating to pique the senses without spoiling the story.  Most important, the dancing should carry you away.  This production earns high marks in all categories.  The camera work, with occasional exceptions, loves the dancers and choreography.  You can fully appreciate design and execution in relation to the entire stage.  The sets are gorgeous, and the choreography allows the dancers to perform truly dazzling feats with superb elegance and grace.

This version sets the story in the 18th century, and the costumes and sprightly movements, especially Drosselmeyer's, are truly evocative of the period.  From the very beginning, the procession of families, ladies, and gentlemen mincing through the falling snow draws you in.  Arkhipova is simply astounding as Clara; in the Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy, she seems to float even during the pyrotechnics of the Presto section.  Mukhamedov is also stunning; when he leaps downstage to receive his bride in the final act, he soars effortlessly. It's a small moment, but one that seems to encapsulate the rapture of Clara's dreams of love.  In fact, the lead dancers have huge roles in this production, but their artistry never falters despite the rigors of the choreography--they move with breathlessly easy fluidity to the last note of music.  The depth of expertise in the entire company is simply awe-inspiring.  There is hardly a moment that isn't magical especially in my favorite scene, the party.

I don't know ballet, but I do know music, and this sumptuous production is a feast for the ears as well as the eyes. In an actual ballet, of course, tempi are largely dependent upon the dancers and choreography.  And the tempo of the Waltz of the Flowers is one of the few problems I have with this version; the cast is so huge, the choreography so elaborate, that it seems to drag along.  On the whole, the dancers are quite heavily costumed in this production, but the Flowers are especially burdened with hand-held candelabra poles while their movements are obscured by the voluminous folds of a funereal lavender fabric. Instead of a fresh floral lilt, the overall effect is of an overpoweringly heavy perfume.

A second quibble is with the Dance of the Mirlitons, which features a shepherd and shepherdess precariously dragging an ovine pull toy behind them.  Though I was quickly engrossed in watching to see if the lamb would topple over, I still noticed that this mannered dance felt cloying and static.  The couple forcibly reminded me of the ubiquitous porcelain lamps that adorned our grandmothers' vanities and night tables (yes, I know how much some of them sell for today).  However, I adore that the complete score is used for this production; the suite is a powerful draw for the concert hall, but the ballet is a wonderful opportunity to present the music in its enchanting entirety.  Dissecting Tchaikovsky's cherished masterwork even for the ballet is an expediency I find hard to forgive.

Despite the noted exceptions, the Bolshoi's 1989 Nutcracker is a spectacularly mounted, magnificently executed delight. It doesn't get much better than this.",1299196800,4,3387,5.052158273381295
2403587,5,B000B6N5VY,"If you appreciate dancing at it's very best you must see this production of The Nutcracker. You will never see a greater ballerina than Natalya Arkhipova. She simply elevates the ballet to it's highest level. As a long time(60 years)lover of the ballet I have never seen any other ballerina to equal her.  She is everything that the ballet has come to mean. Not only is she technically perfect but she is the embodiment of precision, grace and beauty. Her dancing will mesmerize you. This is how the Nutcracker is meant to be seen. While there have been numerous and wonderful adaptations of Tchaikovsky's  ballet, this is the traditional version we have all come to love. Of course, this is the Bolshoi and features some of the finest dancers in the world. So sit back with your favorite libation, turn up the sound and enjoy a wonderful treat for the eyes and ears.",1292976000,5,867,4.660130718954249
2403588,5,B000B6N5VY,"Having seen this particular ballet on PBS I think, I began searching for it. It took no time to find it through Amazon. I was thrilled. The price was right and it arrived just in time for Christmas. It is one of the very best renditions of this ballet.",1265328000,3,252,4.163265306122449
2403589,3,B000B6N5VY,"This is a perfectly fine performance of the Nutcracker but the choreography is all adult performers.  If you are looking for a performance with children in some of the roles (Clara, party scene, Mother Buffoon, etc.) this is not the version you want.  The Clara is excellent, however.",1258675200,,284,4.895833333333333
2403590,5,B000B6N5VY,"This is a wonderful production of the Nutcracker.  Arkhipova is a lovely, graceful and delicate Masha.  Irek Mukhamedov is an absolutely stunning Nutcracker.  My favorite part is the soldier v. mice fight which is an absolute knockout.  Irek and the Mouse King are exciting and mesmerizing.  I just love the cheoreography during this fight and Irek and the Mouse King's form and power are wonderful.  Irek is also fabulous in his solos near the end of the ballet (especially his split jumps he does one after another in a huge circle on the stage).  I also especially love the Arabian dance and the Russian dance.  The Arabian dancers are exotic and intriguing, while the Russian dancers are exciting and joyous.  Drosylmeyer is also fabulous!!  All around, it is great fun to watch!",1233014400,9,783,4.863636363636363
2403591,5,B000B6N5VY,We bought this DVD as a gift for our granddaughter and she thoroughly enjoyed.  The DVD was received in excellent condition.  Thanks for a great product.,1231200000,3,153,4.846153846153846
2403592,5,B000B6N5VY,"This version has it all, the best I have seen live or taped. More content than Barishnikov. Two lead dancers are expressive to the highest degree and technically perfect (although I'm not a dancer). I can tell you this: they make it look easy. Drosselmeyer is better than any I've seen. Way, way, way better than the McCauley Culkin version. That version is not good, because the lead dancers have a very low ""degree of difficulty"" (think olympics). The only part I could do without is the coming and goings of the party-goers. Just skip that part. Enjoy!",1229904000,6,555,4.673469387755102
2403593,5,B000B6N5VY,"This is the most romantic Nutcracker I have seen. The choreography is more adult than the ""spoiled little princess on world tour"" version one sees from the Royal Ballet and at regional ballets in the U.S. at Christmas time. Arkhipova and Mukhamedov seem to be enjoying themselves throughout the performance, with little of the artsy self consciousness you often see from older prima ballerinas (Arkhipova was 26 at the time this performance was filmed). Her dances with Mukhamedov are things of transcendent beauty.

To my knowledge, this is the only DVD of Arkhipova's dancing available, and seeing her in action is well worth the price of admission. She combines extreme feminine grace and surprising power of movement with the most beautiful legs I have ever seen - a truly stunning vision.",1229731200,15,793,5.0534351145038165
2403594,5,B000B6N5VY,"The Tchaikowski NUTCRACKER is one of my favourite ballets.  Unfortunately, I have yet to see a performance that follows the actions indicated in the muscial score; it appears that choreographers after Petipa all seek to insert their own interpretation of what the music depicts.  After seeing more than a dozen productions of this ballet, I have concluded that the Bolshoi Ballet production is perhaps the finest of them all, regardless of its deviation from the action.  Indeed its deviation, I suspect, enhances the production.  For those who quibble about the reed flute dance using a sheep, it should be pointed out that the Tchaikovsky Russian title refers to a Shepherdess.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1229385600,13,705,5.20353982300885

8082550,4,B000B6N5VY,It's an old recording from when the Bolshoi performed in Japan. The image quality suffers a little because it is not in high definition but overall a good buy. I bought it as a present for my wife and she loves it.,1403913600,,214,4.119047619047619

8082552,5,B000B6N5VY,"This dancing is truly great and the performers are fun to watch! The crowd doesn't wait for end of scenes to cheer for these dancers but you can hear them praise them while they are dancing and you might even start thinking, ""Yeah, you're right..that is pretty impressive!"" :) There are lots of versions of the Nutcracker out there but after watching the ""battle"" between them all at Christmas - this is my favorite.",1360972800,,416,4.635135135135135
8082553,5,B000B6N5VY,"Natalya Arkhipova dances like a moonbeam fairy, effortless, fluid, soaring, twirling, floating. She shows so much strength and control, yet appears to be soaring effortlessly around the stage. I was spellbound by her dancing the entire time. The rest of the production is also pretty wonderful, great choreography, seems to go with the music always. I am so captivated by her dancing. I'll try to find more DVDs. Get this DVD. You will not believe her dancing, simply incredible.",1356220800,,479,5.075949367088608
8082554,5,B000B6N5VY,"I have never been a fan of ballet until I saw this masterpiece.  I never tire of watching it over and over again, it is so stunningly beautiful in the music, the dancing, the choreography, simply everything that points to the genius of this performance which is as near to perfection as it gets. A true fan of music does not want to see such a magnificent performance end, and it won't for those who appreciate the efforts of all concerned with this Bolshoi production, and who will never forget it.

It is a mark of the highest professionalism to make the extremely difficult look easy, which is what I see with this Nutcracker.

Thank you, Bolshoi, for sharing it with the world, and a very Merry Christmas 2011, A.D. to you all!",1324425600,2,731,4.481203007518797
