470016,3,6302478103,"I was curious to see Shirley Temple as a young woman, and was pleased to find that she retained the confidence and charm that she displayed in the movies she made in her childhood.  Her character comes to America from Ireland, but has a mysteriously inconsistent brogue; not entirely a surprise to me, but she does a nice job with the role.  In ""The Story of Seabiscuit,"" Temple is a young nurse whose uncle is a horse trainer--but she hates horse racing because her only brother died as the result of a fall in a horse race.
The plot is entirely predictable:  boy meets girl, girl hates boy, boy woos girl, boy wins girl, but the footage of actual horse races makes the film a bit more interesting than it would be without it.
If you're a Shirley Temple fan (and who wouldn't/couldn't be?!), you will want to see this because Shirley is her sweet, pretty self.  Don't expect any singing or dancing, however, as this is not the vehicle for that.",988761600,31,945,4.476744186046512

470209,3,6302478103,"You could make a case that the two most shining lights during the crap days of the Great Depression were a dimpled moppet with golden curls and an undersized racehorse with knobby knees but no quit at all in him. 1949's alleged biopic, The Story of Seabiscuit, paired up these two paragons what diverted millions of us when we most craved those moments of escapism. This movie, though, barely does justice to Shirley Temple and to Seabiscuit.

And, by the way, if you still haven't seen 2003's Seabiscuit film, then you're missing out on something truly exceptional. Adapting Laura Hillenbrand's bestselling biography, that film, to date, is the most accurate, dynamic, and lyrical recounting of the Biscuit's life. Compared to that, the 1949 picture pales.

Excerpts of Hillenbrand's vivid descriptions of the ungainly Biscuit: ""His stubby legs were a study in unsound construction, with huge, squarish, asymmetrical 'baseball glove' knees that didn't quite straighten all the way"" and his ""gallop was so disorganized that he had a maddening tendency to whack himself in the front ankle with his own hind hoof."" In the 1949 flick, Barry Fitzgerald refers to Seabiscuit as that ""smallish sort of colt with big knees.""

Warner Bros. initially was going to roll with ""Always Sweethearts"" as the movie title, suggesting that the plot was going to revolve more around the 21-year-old Shirley Temple's romantic arc than around Seabiscuit. And, yeah, there seems to be a tug-of-war vibe between those two plot threads. Shirley, still melting hearts, plays Irish lass and nurse-in-training Margaret O'Hara, newly arrived to Millford Farms near Paris, Kentucky with her uncle, the wizened horse trainer, Shawn O'Hara (Fitzgerald). Both O'Haras are scarred by a past tragedy. Shawn no longer trains jump horses. Margaret refuses to hook up with jockeys for fear of their getting injured on the track. But along comes jockey Ted Knowles (Lon McCallister) who woos Margaret at Millford Farms and then at Ridgewood Ranch, CA, where Shawn had to relocate for health reasons. I'll be upfront and confess that the love story barely holds my attention. It's mostly because McCallister isn't much of a presence. But it's also because Shirley Temple vanishes for extended periods, leaving me not much invested. And, besides, I'd come here for the Biscuit.

Don't twist it, much of the narrative is highly fictionalized, including the O'Haras themselves and that limp biscuit, Ted Knowles. However, owner Charles Howard and replacement jockey Goerge Woolf really existed. Director David Butler does keep it authentic with regards to Seabiscuit's exploits on the track, going as far as using actual newsreel footage of Seabiscuit's most famous races, most notably the 1938 match race against rival War Admiral and the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap. As such there's a bit of a jarring element in that when the races commence, the screen drops the Techniclor to shift to black and white. However, if I remember it right, the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap was in color.

Unlike the 2003 film, this 1949 biopic doesn't do enough to etch out the Biscuit's true character and personality. Did you know that other horses didn't want to run with Seabiscuit because he enjoyed taunting them with his blazing speed? What made Seabiscuit so legendary and such a compelling historical figure was that his underdog frame coupled with his tenaciousness and indomitable fighting spirit made him a symbol of optimism for a downtrodden nation. We barely get a whiff of that in this movie. Also, Shirley Temple's Irish accent isn't very convincing. As Shirley transitioned from toddler to teenhood, her box office popularity steadily waned. By 1949, she knew what was up. She made only one more motion picture (A Kiss for Corliss) and then retired from the silver screen if not from public life.",1404691200,,3849,5.122611464968153

In spite of the risks and pitfalls, everything turns out for the best.

Leaving my facile cynicism behind, the movie is well crafted and a nice way to pass some time.  If you accept it for what it is, you could see this as hollywood at its best.  My daughter certainly enjoyed it, and I enjoyed watching it with her.

470271,4,6302478103,"Based on the true story of an unknown horse who became the winningest horse in horse-racing. The key facts are in this film. A man sells a horse for $8,000 that goes on to win $438,000 in the late 1930's, during the Great Depression, in the days when you could buy a nice house for $5,000.

This is not a story about girl's love for her horse. It is about an old Irishman who can see the ability in horses others cannot, and about a young man who loves riding and loves a girl, and the girl does not want him to ride, because her brother was killed riding.

Both horse and jockey were injured in real-life, and both came back to win the big race; and the jockey did fall in love with his nurse.

Sure this film fills in the spaces with some embellishment for charm. Filmed in beautiful, Technicolor, the film switches briefly to black-&-white, twice, to show the real Seabiscuit in the actual races. Seabiscuit's son, a winning race-horse himself, plays him in the rest of the film. One scene shows Seabiscuit darting, jumping, running, and kicking in his corral, turning on a dime, light on his feet, and so quick compared to every-day horses. Most people, like me, who have seen horses in person, never knew a horse could move this quick.

I liked seeing the 1940's architecture, furnishings, clothing, and locations.

Shirley Temple is beautiful in color. We only see a few glimpses of Shirley's unguarded, real expressions of emotion and natural responses that were constant in her childhood films. Yet, even with her guarded, affected acting here, for concentrating on her Irish-accent; she still sparkles. Her Irish uncle is charming.

The Tobey Maguire version of the film of the same name is good too.

Under the comment-button below; I suggest how this film could have been even better, and what bumped this film from 3-stars to 4 at the end.",1282435200,,1851,4.6422018348623855

Temple, who tried throughout the '40's to move from child star to serious adult actress, does a reasonable job in the role, but it's Fitzgerald who steals the movie.",1265846400,,1204,6.921052631578948
470273,2,6302478103,"The Story of Seabiscuit (David Butler, 1949)

In her landmark book Seabiscuit, Laura Hillenbrand refers to this 1949 Shirley Temple vehicle as ""unforgivably awful."" I assumed at the time she was talking about the historical inaccuracy rampant in movies like this at the time and promptly forgot about it. I have since married a certified Shirley Temple fanatic, and so when this popped up on Turner Classic Movies a couple of weeks ago, I DVRed it. We started watching it, and Hillenbrand's comment returned to me tenfold. While I didn't hate it quite as much (okay, nearly as much) as Hillenbrand seems to have, I'm guessing that's because I've spent far more time in the celluloid gutter. You want awful movies? I'll give you awful movies. The Story of Seabiscuit is not an awful movie, though to be fair it doesn't miss the mark by too much.

Temple plays Margaret O'Hara, a winsome Irish lass (with an accent that defines ""variable"") who comes to America with her grandfather Sean (The Quiet Man's Barry Fitzgerald) after he retires from training jumpers thanks to a horrible accident at the Grand National. He takes to flat racing well enough, though he has a lot of affection for a gangly two-year-old no one else on the farm seems all that taken with. Eventually, he finds himself working for industrialist Charles Howard (TV character actor Pierre Watkin), whom he convinces to buy the little colt no one wanted, and from there, well, history.

Except that the history isn't accurate, and it's bathed in the kind of hideous melodrama you'd expect. (Scene: Shirley Temple tears up when granddad's talking about the Grand National. Scene: Shirley Temple tells the jockey pursuing her she doesn't date jockeys because of that incident. Scene: Granddad takes Shirley Temple to the track to see Seabiscuit race, and guess who's on his back? If you can't draw the conclusion, you haven't seen enough movies.) There's a great deal of scenery-chewing from all involved, a number of horses playing Seabiscuit who don't really look alike (I won't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure there was one race where he was played by both a bay and a chestnut), and a truly silly story surrounding it all. But it's watchable in its stupidity, which is something I can't say for about a quarter of the movies I've watched this week. **",1263600000,,2320,4.824120603015075

470275,1,6302478103,"This is probably the worst horse racing film I've ever seen (another contender for that title is one about Black Gold that showed Anthony Quinn couldn't act worth a darn when he started out).  There are almost no facts in it about Seabiscuit.  The acting and writing is low-quality.  The Irish trainer stuff is pure fiction.  I wonder if most of the real people involved in Seabiscuit's life refused to sign releases, so they blatantly fictionalized them.  The bizarre thing about this film was that it was made when most Americans knew Seabiscuit's story, so they had to know this was full of nonsense.  This one isn't worth your time or money.",1210464000,,645,4.714285714285714
470316,4,6302478103,"If you are simply in search of a factual account of the life and times of Seabiscuit, this is not the DVD to consider. But this 1949 release delivers on a variety of other tracks to make it a nice addition to the collection.

The movie includes rare race newsreel footage of Seabiscuit, is a great representative of Technicolor and has a script which features Shirley Temple.

The fictional story is of Thoroughbred trainer Shawn O'Hara (Barry Fitzgerald) and his niece, Margaret (Temple), who arrive in America after the death of her brother, who was a jockey. O'Hara is the trainer of the young, gangly Seabiscuit and tries hard to convince owner Charles Howard (Pierre Watkin) that he has a possible champion in his stable.

Meanwhile, Margaret falls in love with jockey Ted Knowles (Lon McCallister) and will marry him only if he gives up the sport. But Shawn O'Hara has a different plan; he feels Knowles aboard The Biscuit is a winning exacta and must convince his niece and Howard that his plan is the best for everyone.

Howard is the only real person portrayed in the story and - in actuality - was impressed enough in the potential of Seabiscuit to purchase him from a major stable, who was using the young runner as a hard-knocker, racing him as often as possible at a number of tracks.

A period piece when Hollywood would not let facts get in the way of a script, The Story of Seabiscuit enters the winner's circle by depicting triumph over tragedy and the fear brought on by self-doubt.",1202774400,,1500,4.645283018867924

470321,3,6302478103,"Books have been written about what Hollywood does to history when it makes a movie, so it is not surprising that ""The Story of Seabiscuit"" takes great liberties with the story of the famous thoroughbred.  But I was actually surprised that so much of the true story made it into the movie.  Screenwriter John Taintor Foote must have done some research, because some key details, such as training Seabiscuit to respond to the sound of the bell for the celebrated match race with War Admiral, are worked into the story.  But you do get a sense for the film's priorities when you take the fact that Seabiscuit's jockey, Red Pollard, married the nurse who took care of him in the hospital when he was recuperating from this leg injury, and it turns into the big romantic plotline of the film with jockey Ted Knowles (Lon McCallister) falling for Margaret O'Hara (Shirley Temple), the neice of Shawn O'Hara (Barry Fitzgerald), who has come from Ireland to train Seabiscuit for glory.  Margaret is studying to become a nurse and likes Ted, but since her brother was killed at the Grand National (a flashback using film from ""National Velvet""), she cannot stand to be in love with a jockey.  When he is injured (chest and arm rather than leg) they become closer and he agrees to stop racing, but then comes the big race and--well, you can just imagine.
Another way that you can tell where the focus of this film is would be that Shirley Temple gets top billing over Barry Fitzgerald, even though the strength of this film is Fitzgerald working his peculiar brand of magic on this horse and the actual footage of Seabiscuit's big races (at which point the movie suddenly goes from color to black & white so that the actual footage fits).  This 1949 film was Temple's last movie, made 14 years after she received a special juvenile Academy Award, and besides the familiar smile why she shouts for ""Biscuit!"" from the box at the races, she adds little to the film.  However, she is still better than the caricature of Wong the O'Hara's Cook.
It is a safe assumption that most people are going to come to ""The Story of Seabiscuit"" out of curiosity, having read Laura Hillenbrand's best selling novel or seen the critically acclaimed 2003 film, so all of the changes in the historical record are going to really stick out.  Charles S. Howard (Pierre Watking), the owner of Seabiscuit gets to keep his name, but that is just about it.  Besides, even the interest in seeing actual footage of Seabiscuit racing is less impressive when you can see it in the excellent ""PBS American Experience"" documentary.  But if you have read the book, seen the movie and the documentary, and still have not satisfied your longing for all things Seabiscuit, then this film is certainly worth a look.",1071964800,13,2768,4.688659793814433
470322,3,6302478103,"""The Story of Seabiscuit"" is a perfect example of the ridiculously historically inaccurate Hollywood studio film. Next to the Errol Flynn pre-Civil War movie ""Santa Fe Trail"", ""The Story of Seabiscuit"" is probably the most fanciful version of history ever put on film. If that weren't enough, Shirley Temple's Irish brogue is reminicent of the Kevin Costner School of Foreign Accents, going back and forth from perfect to painful.
That being said, the movie does have a few bright spots that carry it through the mush of melodrama. The Technicolor photography is absolutely stunning, for one thing. The story moves along at a pretty good pace, and there's a good amount of humor sprinkled into the script. Cast members Lon McCallister and Barry Fitzgerald (""The Quiet Man"") are tops as jockey and wise old horse handler, respectively. Even Seabiscuit's son, Sea Sovereign, was used for close-ups. Best of all is the shockingly innovative technique used by the filmmakers to work in the black and white footage of the actual racehorse, Seabiscuit, in action. Opting for pure black and white segments, the newsreel of Seabiscuit is cleverly added to make a seamless segment into the Technicolor film. Strange, but oddly effective.
The nine minute primer on the intricacies of a horse race, included in the bonus material, is still pretty accurate and informative.
Worth watching at least once to see Fitzgerald's performance and the Seabiscuit footage, plus the Technicolor splendor. Temple fans or Seabiscuit completists may want to own the disc. Harmless fun for family viewing, and suitable for kids who like horsies.",1065225600,27,1618,5.179389312977099

470324,3,6302478103,"THE STORY OF SEABISCUIT is a fairly entertaining family movie inspired by the racing career of a legendary horse. The film is mostly about the fortunes of a horse and his trainer (Barry Fitzgerald). For background there is a romance between the trainer's niece (Shirley Temple) and Seabiscuit's jockey (Lon McCallister).
Fitzgerald is very much in his element and obviously enjoys his role. Temple is stiff and awkward with her attempts at imitating an Irish brogue. McCallister does a good job in one of his last appearances before his premature retirement from the industry in 1953.
The plot is predictable with tension buiding up to the final race. Actual film footage of Seabiscuit racing provides a big bonus.

The big draw is that real film footage of Seabiscuit's great races is used in the movie, and the horses that play him in the close-ups and training are Seabiscuit's close relatives - a son and a nephew, I believe. Color and black and white film interspersed adds to the film rather than detract. Really enjoyed this. You have to put aside feelings about the painful and inappropriate racial portrayals of African Americans in that day, as that is the negative in this film, but for the most part, it is very enjoyable.",1476230400,3,687,4.781512605042017
