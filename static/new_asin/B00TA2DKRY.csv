8701059,5,B00TA2DKRY,"I am a Cotillard fan . She has ""something "" I can't describe that makes her special . She is a very talented actor She makes Joan come to life in this play .Joan was a woman ahead of her time and did what no man could do in her place .She must have shamed and embarrassed many men in her time. They couldn't get rid of her fast enough. Cotillard does a great job as Joan, ( Jeanne D'Arc ) .",1503705600,,390,3.768292682926829
8701060,5,B00TA2DKRY,"I love Jeanne d'Arc au Bucher, and have seen it staged several times, but could not find it in DVD. I have found this version very moving, although I regret that it was performed as a concert. Anyway, the interpretations are superb, Marion Cotillard's in particular, and she has the ""physique du role"" I have always imagined for Jean. The emotion of the actors while doing their job is a special gift for the audience.",1446595200,3,418,4.586666666666667
8701061,5,B00TA2DKRY,"Wonderful performance of a work not often performed. Cotillard was superb as Jeanne d'Arc.  I go way back with this work when the only recording was with Vera Zorina and Eugene Ormandy, Philadelphia Orchestra.",1441238400,,209,5.147058823529412
8701062,5,B00TA2DKRY,"In the late 1930s Arthur Honegger collaborated with the poet and diplomat Paul Claudel on a sprawling oratorio about Jeanne dArc, part nation-building, part satirical expose of political hypocrisy, part religious mysticism. The role of Jeanne is a speaking rather than a singing role, but everything that takes place is focussed upon the character, and it provides a juicy opportunity and daunting challenge for a French actress.

Marion Cotillard delivers in spades. She provides everything one could wish for in the role. She  conveys such a complex combination of innocence, pain, defiance, pride, terror, hope and love of God and country. Even when shes not speaking her face subtly mirrors the events that swirl around her. I would have loved to have seen more of that face; a Cotillard-cam off to the side of the stage, perhaps. And shes a virtuoso of crying; such an effective use of tears hasn't been seen since Margaret OBrien asked director Vincente Minelli during the filming of Meet Me In St. Louis if he wanted her tears to go all the way down her cheek, or just half-way.

There are other great performances on display in this really excellent Blu ray: all of the solo singers and actors create characters of depth and individuality, but Xavier Gallais stands out as Frere Dominique. The choral singing by both children and adults was likewise full of character, moving or hilarious as the story unfolds. Marc Soustrot and the Barcelona Symphony & Catalonia National Orchestra provide an excellent performance of Honeggers witty, eloquent and complex score. Of special note is the large part Honegger wrote for the Ondes Martenot, which provides a quirky other-world sound throughout the piece. Everything comes together in this production, and as stunning as Cotillard is in the central role, her supporting cast is just as good.",1435104000,2,1844,5.059210526315789
8701063,4,B00TA2DKRY,"Composer Arthur Honegger (1892 -- 1955) and poet Paul Claudel (1868 -- 1955) collaborated on this large-scale work ""Joan of Arc at the Stake"" which premiered in a concert version in 1938 and as an opera in 1942.  The piece is of a mixed character combining elements of opera and oratorio.  Although not a staple of the repertoire, the piece still gets performed and recorded.

This new DVD of the work is a concert version but includes substantial acting and costuming. Marc Soustrot, a specialist in French music, conducts the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra and large, massed choruses in this 2012 performance in Barcelona. The performance features the famous French actress Marion Cotillard as Joan. Cotillard's performance underscores the hybrid character of the work. Her role is entirely spoken as is that  of the male lead, Xavier Gallais, who plays Brother Dominique. Cotillard and Gallais bring passion and conviction to the work.  Cotillard has performed the role of Joan several times and is performing it in June, 2015, in New York City with the New York Philharmonic. With the fervor that Cotillard brings to her role, the highlight of this performance is still the large choruses and Soustrot's conducting.

The work consists of a Prelude and of eleven interconnected scenes.  It begins as Joan is about to be burned at the stake and ends with her immolation. The intervening scenes constitute flashbacks on her life and trial. The work is meant to be episodic and impressionistic. It does not offer a connected portrait of Joan or her mission.

The scenes and music are of varied character.  Much of the music is influenced by Gregorian chant with large unison sections. The piece includes some movingly ethereal moments particularly in the opening and closing sections. There is also much that is sharp and sarcastic. Honegger and Claudel portray Joan as tried by a ensemble headed by a swine as the Judge, by sheep as the jury and by an ass as the clerk. The music and the text are sharp and mocking. Other scenes involve card-players. Joan boldly proclaims her innocence and is shown as afraid of the fate of being burned alive which awaits her.  She is comforted by angels from heaven. The work has strong religious themes, a commitment to French nationalism, and a criticism of the crude, materialistic character of contemporary life.

The strong elements of spectacle in this work come through in the performance. The DVD emphasizes the size and nature of the orchestra and the chorus and the emotions and gestures of the characters, especially Cotillard. Honegger included both saxophones and piano in the orchestra, but the most unusual touch was the use of an electric instrument called the ondes martnot.  It uses oscillating strings to produce a whining, tension-filled tone. The instrument has a large role in this work and is prominently shown in the DVD. The DVD also includes English subtitles. Because of the dramatic, hybrid nature of ""Jeanne d'Arc au Bucher"" it is valuable to see the work on DVD rather than simply hearing it on CD.

This DVD offers a fine performance of ""Jeanne D'Arc au Bucher"" and is a good way to get to know the work. The work presents an important 20th Century composer, Honegger, who is not as well-known as he might be. The work reminded me of the breadth and diversity of 20th Century music. I did not fall in love with this music but was glad to get to know it. The liner notes accompanying the DVD  provide useful background to the piece. The DVD is distributed by Naxos, and Naxos kindly provided me with a review copy.

Total Time: 81 minutes

8701064,4,B00TA2DKRY,"Arthur Honegger's music is consistently delicate and not known for excesses of tone or dynamic or harmonic palate. The Swiss composer wrote somewhat in the shadow of others like Poulenc or Milhaud and, yet, there is much to admire in this concert rendition of his opera ""Joan of Arc at the Stake"". This is really not a typical opera anyway, in that the roles of Joan and her mentor Brother Dominic are acted, not sung (which explains why Marion Cotillard is cast as Jean d'Arc). The drama is written as a series of tableaux from Joan's hearing the voice of heaven to her believers and disbelievers through her trial for heresy and the final immolation and execution. It is a moving work though, again, not in a way that we have come to expect opera or even scenic oratorio to be. Honegger's text is based on poetry on the same subject by Paul Claudel. The performances here are quite good but in particular the wonderful combined choirs and some of the secondary roles, such as Marta Almanajo as Marguerite. The Barcelona Symphony under the direction of Marc Soustrot is a pleasant and impressive surprise. Recommended for those who enjoy works on historical and religious themes and this unusual source!",1433203200,3,1204,4.76555023923445
