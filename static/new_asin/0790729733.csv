94708,4,0790729733,"I feel that JFK is a very important movie to watch. Even if you are not a fan of Costner, Oliver Stone or the idea of Oswald as a pawn. It is an educational tool for america to look at and wonder what can and might have  happened.  The informational element of the movie is very high, Fast cuts,  Black and white or slow motion flashbacks, and a plot, no matter how long  the movie it is hard to stop watching.  One of the best visional movies in  the last 50 years. (well deserved Oscar for Cinematography) Next to  Platoon, Stone's best.",928627200,,539,4.2254901960784315
94709,5,0790729733,"I write from an outsider point of view as I am a 15 year old Colombian student:  I am interested in world affairs and sought in JFK an insight into late 20th century American history. Being familiar with several of the  world events at the time, JFK presented an incredible experience which led  me to find more and more about the Kennedy murder, Vietnam war, and America  in the 60s and 70s on the whole. I am a huge Oliver Stone fan and think JFK  is another confirmation of his genius.
As for performances I think Kevin  Costner did a good job -although I don't generally like his acting- and as  usual, Tommy Lee Jones stole all the attention for every minute he appeared  on screen.
Amazing edition and majestic script. Only wonder how certain  scenes would sound in 5.1 DD  5 stars, two thumbs up, I know this movie  will be as exiting for any person as it was for me...",919468800,,876,4.345679012345679
94710,5,0790729733,"It definitely makes sense for one to sit and watch this movie. It presents a very clear picture of the circumstances surronding and stemming from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Although some insist that the  dominant argument presented in this film is not true, it definitely makes a  whole bunch of sense and it will get you thinking. If you are just  interested in a good mystery/court drama then you'll be happy about  watching this movie too. Very interesting movie. Great job, Oliver Stone!

94793,3,0790729733,"Oliver Stone's paranoid fantasy about the Kennedy assassination. Seems that Stone's theory is that JFK wanted to put an end to the Vietnam War but the military industrial complex didn't want that to happen so they (whoever ""they"" might be) had him killed and replaced by Johnson.  Outside of the fact that there is no historical evidence for this theory it makes for an ok plot with Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison the crusading DA, Tommy Lee Jones as the unappealing Clay Shaw, Oswald as the patsy and some Cuban mercenaries who drift in and out and Stone seems to think did the dirty deed.  The movie is way too long  and has lots of digressions and lose ends that aren't tied together. But there is some fine acting, Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, and even Kevin Costner, who resuscitates his Elliott Ness character for another go.  As history the movie is nonsense -- in real life,  Jim Garrison was a self promoting crackpot and Clay Shaw his innocent victim.

94868,5,0790729733,"...More and more Americans are awakening to the reality of JFK's murder by the ""shadow government"" that runs this country. The presidency is nothing more than a managerial position, nothing more. The President is a spokesman, the public voice of the power structure that was created way back in 1913 with the rise of the Fed and the hijacking of the government by the powerful banks who run the entire show hidden from view, but influence and control every aspect of our lives. Like indentured servants, we the people are but chattel, property, no more valuable than the meat we consume. We are expendable, we are nothing but canon fodder and a means of generation wealth for the 0.01%, the very top of the food chain. JFK had to go because he threatened the moneyed elites who finance the military industrial state and it's subsidiaries, the CIA, the NSA, The FBI, DEA, and the rest of the national security apparatus that runs this country, indeed, the entire planet....",1495497600,2,972,4.791666666666667
94869,4,0790729733,"I am 62 and I remember the day my third grade teacher rushed in the classroom shortly after lunch to write on the board, too choked up to speak,  that President Kennedy had been shot. I figured he was just wounded and I could imagine him joking with the nurses. When I got home I learned he had died.  I have been a JFK assassination buff since 1970 and as such have 38 books on the subject examining the crime from every angle. As such I almost love this film. I fault it for having the main character learn most of his facts (like I did) by watching television.  A better film is Executive Action with Burt Lancaster, Will Geer and Robert Ryan which puts you right into the middle of the planning of the assassination. This film, for all the detail has a kind of movie-ish predictability. You just know, even if you weren't a JFK buff like me, that Garrison is doomed to fail. Oliver Stone drops many broad hints about who was really behind the crime and goes so far as to implicate LBJ. I feel a bit cheated though when Garrison meets with Mr.""X"" who lays out all the details of JFK's killing in militaristic terms but then hides the identity of who gave the orders, referring to his superiors as General ""Y"" and so on. Then he exits saying, ""I hope you get a break!"" and huffs away. I wish Garrison had the power to subpoena his ass and force him to testify but then he was out of his jurisdiction wasn't he?...How convenient for the bad guys.  The two worst parts were when Garrison laments that  David Ferrie was the only one to show any remorse. What remorse? He was only scared for his own life when his fellow plotters turned on him in light of Garrison's probing. The next worse part that makes me grimace is when Garrison, after seeing Robert Kennedy gunned down on tv (Which did not happen by the way) goes to his estranged wife's bed and makes love to her because he is really scared now and he never loved her enough. Huh?... and that is relevant to JFK's death in what way? Still, I admire Garrison's impassioned speech before the jury at the end and it sends a chill my way when he says, looking out at us as the audience, that the rest is up to us. .. and it really is.",1495324800,,2186,4.257831325301205

94875,3,0790729733,"This version checks in at over three hours. Using archival footage and reenactments this tells the story of the death of President Kennedy in Dallas with data culled from two books and weaved together. Years later District Attorney Jim Garrison from... New Orleans goes on what appears to be a witch hunt in an effort to assemble a large cast of characters together and accuse them of being involved in a plot that involved multiple shooters to go after Kennedy in Dallas. With information he has gathered he has determined that Kennedy was going to discontinue the United States' involvement in Viet Nam. Well, industry thrives on war and industry does not want their cash cow (Viet Nam) to go away so...Kennedy has to go away.

Includes a number of long monologues and dialogs, while true it is beautifully filmed and many famous faces appear it is just too long and lumbering. Family drama is mixed in to try and keep it engaging. Insightful but not edge-of-the seat story telling. Swearing and at times not easy to watch due to injuries.

94900,3,0790729733,"This movie, a docudrama, had promise, but the problem with it is that the director, Oliver Stone, was overly self-indulgent with his conspiracy theories involving the assassination of President Kennedy. While some of his theories are interesting and may very well have merit, especially as the Warren Commission Report was undeniably flawed, some of it is way out there, especially in terms of alleging that the Vice-President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, may have had a hand in it. So, in this way he loses some of his audience.

Still, this film, based upon New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's own investigation into the Kennedy assassination and his subsequent prosecution of someone he believed to have been involved as a member of the CIA, has some merit. It is unfortunate that Oliver Stone just did not know when to stop and cut his losses. Consequently, the movie, at just over three hours in length, is simply too long, and the kitchen sink approach, in terms of conspiracy theories, works against it.

Despite the film's merits, in particularly the editing of archival footage into the mix, which is outstanding and gives  the film an authenticity of time and place,  this film is riddled by some of the worst southern accents around. In particular, Joe Pesci's is simply atrocious. It is downright laughable, along with the fright wig he wears. Why he was cast in his role is beyond me, as his performance and accent are dreadful. Moreover, Kevin Costner in the lead role, has a southern accent that comes and goes. So, this all has the effect of being a distraction.

While parts of the film are excellent, and the closing argument at the end given by Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison is affecting, the film is hoisted by the petard the director's self-indulgence. While the viewer may get a modicum of enjoyment from this film, one may also, as I did, just wish for the film to hurry up and end.",1490227200,,1909,4.7902735562310035

94917,5,0790729733,"Although JFK is centered around an investigation into JFK's assassination, you cannot view it as history. It isn't history, it's a movie that takes license from historical events.

All star cast, from Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ed Asner, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Gary Oldman, Laurie Metcalf, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon and (at the time) newcomers like Michael Rooker (and I'm leaving out many) with Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones in the lead roles. Everyone is good, and everyone delivers an outstanding performance. Great script. with lines like ""how do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you?"" And """"Treason doth never prosper,"" wrote an English poet, ""What's the reason? For if it prosper, none dare call it treason."""" It's a three and a half hour movie that centers around Kevin Costner, and it's watchable (that, in itself, is an achievement). To me, it is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington meets the Kennedy Assassination, with Costner/Garrison in the Jimmy Stewart role. One of my all-time favorites.",1488326400,,1068,5.03954802259887
94918,4,0790729733,"At one time the question of who killed President John F. Kennedy on that bad November day in 1963 was something of a cottage industry among those who did not buy into the admittedly rushed conclusions of the Warren Commission that was ordered to come to some conclusions in the wake of many unanswered questions by his successor, Lyndon Baines Johnson, in order to assuage the shell-shocked American people. In some circles, circles like that around New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison whose investigation of the matter is the subject of Oliver Stones take on the subject in his award-winning JFK, that report only added fuel to the fire of those nagging unanswered questions. Especially by those who could not believe on the public facts of the case that a lone gunman, something of a loser and misbegotten, Lee Harvey Oswald could have done the deed alone. And while that cottage industry has faded somewhat as those who were avidly pursuing their theories have passed on or nothing has come up since then to finally allow them to find their smoking gun there will always been a place for such speculation as long as some people like to cling to conspiracy theories of history-or politics.

Of course everybody in America in those days, like in earlier times Pearl Harbor and later times 9/11, knew exactly where they were when they heard the news of the assassination of JFK. I had been in a classroom at North Adamsville High when the headmaster came on the P.A. system to tell us the shocking news that one of our own, our poster boy Irishman even if he was chandelier, had been killed down in heathen redneck Dallas. I took it personally pretty hard for a while but I moved on between unattached girls, college, military service, more girls, women, who I wound marrying and having children with and trying to keep body and soul together for a while. Then one day some years after 1991 the year Stones film came out I was at a library and noticed a DVD on display with the title The Men Who Killed Kennedy from 1988. The title implying, as is usual in this case, more than one killer alone perked my latent interest since although I was aware of the various theories afloat, most notably Mark Lanes Rush to Judgement which was the godfather of the genre I still figured that the nefarious Oswald did the deed on his own hook. I grabbed that DVD with both hands and subsequently read or viewed most of the material in English on the subject. That was the time when I initially looked at Stones film to see where he was going with his theory honing in especially on Garrisons work which did actually bring somebody, Clay Shaw, if unsuccessfully, before a court.

I had written a short review of that original film The Men Who Killed Kennedy some of which I have reread and after recently re-watching JFK, no mean task at three and a half hours, can stand for my take on Stones take on the Garrison investigation. Below are some points the two films have in common notwithstanding that Stone, as on other occasions, has used a great deal of cinematic license to produce a commercial film.

Those of us who are interested in history often come across situations where we have to defend the notion that there are conspiracies in history but not all history is a conspiracy. In modern times, with the earlier example of Pearl Harbor and the possible future exception of 9/11, the mystery of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963 has played into the hands of those who see history merely as a conspiracy. I have read more than my fair share of books on the subject, most recently the late Norman Mailers book on Oswald, and here I review a documentary, The Men Who Killed Kennedy from 1988 that, in essence, merely adds fuel to the fire of that controversy. At this remove however I think it is clear that the conspiracy- mongers have had their day on the subject and have come up short. Not through lack of trying, though. (Of course their rejoinder courtesy of the late newsman Daniel Schorr is that the conspiracy was so well planned that even fifty plus years later it still holds water-everybody kept quiet.)

Given my leftward political trajectory since the time of the assassination one would think that I would be amenable to some theory of high-level governmental, corporate or criminal conspiracy. As a teenager I campaigned for Kennedy in 1960. I was shocked and dismayed by his murder, throwing away a political notebook that I kept and swearing off politics forever. That resolve obviously did not last long. I am, moreover, more than willing to believe that governmental officials, corporate officers and criminal masterminds are willing to do anything to keep their positions of power. I could especially believe the theory that then Vice-President Johnson and his minions had a hand in the plot. Hell given Johnsons nasty political sense in his rise to national prominence he could have done the whole deal. However, it just does not wash here. Part of the problem is there are just too many theories to fit the facts.

The real problem with the various conspiracy theories is that they ask us to suspend disbelieve for their theories even greater than the botched up job that the Warren Commission provided. These theories inevitably work between the lines of that report.
I think the classic example in this documentary, that can stand for my opinion in general, is when one of the conspiracy theorists very calmly states his propositions about how the Warren Report botched things and then, as calmly cites four possible groups of conspirators who could have done the deed, anti-Castro Cubans, disgruntled CIA rogue elements, disgruntled militarists and Mafia-types. Well that narrows the field considerably, doesnt it? Stones film falls into that crack since in the course of three and one half hours every theory that I am aware even to the various characters the theories relied on got a airing.

But here is the kicker- I am convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald was capable of doing the murder by himself, that he did it and that he stands before history as having done it. Grand conspiracy theories that deny the role of the individual in history do so in this case for no apparent reason. That theory may not be sexy enough for some but Oswald should have his fifteen minutes of infamy. Unless someone produces the smoking gun missing in all other theories-in short, a real named person (or persons) who did the deed let us leave it at that. Garrison tried and failed with the possible CIA connection through the trial of Clay Shaw who actually was, as the end notes point out was working for the CIA in 1963-although that does not mean he was a conspirator-post facto.  A very interesting and well-produced film though.",1487462400,2,6772,4.729043183742591

94924,1,0790729733,"Why I can't watch the movie JFK all the way through.

Here's one scene as recounted in the book, JFK - The Book of the Film (https://www.amazon.com/JFK-Book-Film-Applause-Screenplay/dp/1557831270) (Applause Screenplay) (from the screenplay of the movie).
Page 169:
== quote ==
CUT TO the sixth floor, where we see Oswald as the shooter. After firing, he runs full speed [1] for the stairs stashing the rifle on the other side of the loft. Our camera follows him roughly down stairs - we hear the loud sound of his shoes banging on the hollow wood - to the lunchroom, where Patrolman Baker and Superintendent Truly run in. Then they start to repeat the same action as seen in the previous screen.

JIM [GARRISON] (voice-over): ... but what the Warren Report would have us believe is that after firing 3 bolt action shots in 5.6 seconds [2], Oswald then leaves three cartridges neatly side by side [3] in the firing nest, wipes the rifle clear of fingerprints [4], stashes the rifle on the other side of the loft, sprints down five flights of stairs [5], past witnesses Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles who never see him [6], and then shows up cool and calm on the second floor in front of Patrolman Baker -- all this within a maximum of 90 seconds of the shooting. Is he out of breath? According to Baker, absolutely not. [7]
== UNQUOTE ==
_______________

The reasons are numbered, and explained below.

[1] A Secret Service agent, John Howlett, was able to walk at a normal walking pace from the sniper's nest to the second floor lunchroom in 78 seconds. The same test, at a fast walking pace, took 74 seconds. Howlett was not short of breath after either test, which followed one another immediately (the only intervening time was using the elevator to ascend back to the sixth floor).

[2] The Warren Commission concluded the shooting happened somewhere between 4.8 seconds [if the second shot missed] to upwards of 7.9 seconds [if the first or third missed]. These are the absolute minimums. They noted the actual times may have been greater.

[3] Photos taken of the crime scene show the shells were not side by side, and the Warren Report never said they were.

[4] Testimony by Dallas Crime Lab Detective J.C.Day (and later, FBI agent Sebastion Latona) noted and testified that the stock of the weapon was old and worn wood, and did not accept or retain discernable fingerprints well. A palmprint was found on the underside of the barrel, and prints were found on the trigger housing. Those parts are metal. There's no evidence Oswald had to wipe down the weapon whatsoever.

[5] It's four flights of stairs - from the sixth floor to the second - not five flights. And this was accomplished in 78 seconds at a normal walking pace in a re-enactment by John Howlett.

[6] There is serious dispute - even between Styles and Adams - how soon after the assassination those two women started to descend the stairs. Oswald, as determined in the re-enactments, could have reached the second floor in 74-78 seconds. If Adams and Styles started their descent even as much as 90 seconds after the shooting, they would not have seen Oswald on the steps. The argument has been advanced that if they left as soon as conspiracy theorists argue, then they should have seen Truly and Baker in their *ascent*. But they didn't see those men either.

[7] Howlett wasn't out of breath either, after TWO re-enactments, in 78 and 74 seconds. Oswald only had to do this once. At a minimum, this allows Oswald 12 - 16 seconds to compose himself before Baker arrived at the lunchroom 90 seconds after the shooting.

Now imagine pausing the scene and explaining to anyone watching with you what's wrong with this scene... it would take probably ten times as long as the scene itself to point out all the errors with Jim Garrison's [Kevin Costner's] voice-over.

ONE SCENE!

Now repeat that process for every scene in the movie. You'll begin to understand the enormity of the disservice Oliver Stone did to this country and to the memory of JFK by utilizing conspiracy sources like Jim Marrs to provide the template for his movie.",1486512000,,4109,4.73006993006993

I feel that this film is a way to pass on some of what did take place, When the US was a very different country then it is now.",1478217600,,321,3.9384615384615387
95347,5,0790729733,"Back, and to the left.  That's all one needs.  This Proven, from the video, shows the only direction of the headshot that killed Mr Kennedy, which could only of been fired from a gun not inside the book depository.  A picture paints a thousand words, and regardless of all the other circumstantial evidence, the unbiased mind can see that our Government killed Mr Kennedy.  Not Oswald.  Why?

War makes money....Here we are 50 years later.  Have we not again see an awful amount of evidence that our Government gets into wars by people who have a multi million dollar payoff involved?  Since the love of money is the root of all evil, it only makes sense that those who love money in high offices will carry out atrocities against the public who they decided to stand up for....but instead create wars leading their constiuents sons and daughters shot, burned, and blown into pieces....So the one's in power can make more money....and have more power, which makes more money, and gives them access to more power.

After looking back over history, for thousands of years this is exactly how every country/kingdom has operated.  If not, there would be a free standing country that has lasted thousands of years.  Man cannot govern man.  How many Billions have come and gone?  Only one man ever had it right.  But He was nailed to a cross by the governing parties of His day.  Like the quote from JFK, ""like a Lamb led to the slaughter"".  Jesus followed the Creator of all Creation's voice, perfectly.  He spoke of total forgiveness, praying for you enemies (terrorists), and even loving them as He had loved them.  Love and Hate, Good and Evil, Black and White, Light and Darkness.  Simple. No grey area, just lack of understanding.  After it being revealed to me that Jesus is who He says He is, all the nuts and bolts fall into the right containers.  It all makes easy sense.  This thing (life) was not made to be so hazy....Enter confusion....Satan.

Pray that Jesus will reveal himself to you.  It costs you nothing but you will gain everything.  He is the only way back to relationship with the One who knitted your spirit together inside your mother's womb.  The intelligence behind the intricacy.  The beauty being in hid in plain site.",1478217600,,2241,4.694087403598972

I suggest you watch Rod Serling's 1960's screenplay Seven Days in May about an attempted coup by US Generals opposed to nuclear disarmament and then think about JFK with the far more convoluted parties and interests supporting a coup by assassination. The Warren Commission Report was as ludicrous then as it is now.

95490,5,0790729733,"Great film, really compelling well made thriller.  The first five minutes are so is one of the best openings I've ever seen, really draws you in, builds the tension and mystery that is carried throughout.  I'll just be clear, the theory is total crap, riddled with a ton of flaws.  I have no earthly clue if Oswald shot JFK as a lone wolf attack or part of a conspiracy, but Jim Garrison was a nutty DA whose theory doesn't hold up to any amount of scrutiny.  As a side note, I doubt even Stone believes this theory as the very next film he made, Nixon, gives an entirely different theory altogether on why JFK was killed.

Ultimately the truth of the story that doesn't matter.  Frankly I think people are very silly when a film about a historical topic ""changes things.""  It's a very well made film regardless.  It is in fact the only Oliver Stone film I've really truly liked.  Platoon was heavy handed and nowhere near as effective as films like Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now (and yes I know Stone fought in Vietnam, still a heavy handed overrated film).  Natural Born Killers is the most bludgeoning film I've ever seen in which you know the really simple message within the first thirty minutes but damned if Oliver isn't going to keep saying it over and over and over again for the next two and a half hours.

Anyway, point being I think overall Oliver Stone is an insanely overrated director who largely makes mediocre to terrible films.  But this one, is really worth watching no matter what you think actually happened in Dallas.",1474588800,,1545,4.537906137184115

It's film you have to sit through, there's no special effects, like star wars, or Aliens,etc. So patience is a must. It kept me captivated.
The dialog and characters are intriguing and fairly believable
It is a subject that captivates us to this very day.
Cons
It's a bit long winded but I understand why.
That being said, whether you believe or not believe that JFK assassination is a conspiracy it should be considered a classic film to watch. But if you buy the ""magic bullet theory"" you're very gullible.",1472515200,2,549,4.612244897959184

95697,5,0790729733,"I gave ""JFK"" 5 stars because it is one of the best movies I have seen during my 67-year long lifetime. While I have seen many hundreds of movies over the years, ""JFK"" is absolutely a classic. There are few movies that I would watch more than once. ""The Hunt For Red October,"" Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea"" and ""Bladerunner"" are among these few that can I watch over and over through the years and still experience the feelings evoked by the original screening.

Moreover, I lived that era first hand. The United States became a very different country after John Kennedy's assassination. I'll never forget being in last period class in high school when the announcement came over the PA system. How stunned we all were by the magnitude of the event. My thanks go to Oliver Stone for encapsulating those tragic days in a first rate movie.",1471824000,,846,4.64

It rewards repeat viewing especially if you decide to read / view other material concerning this case. The performances are solid and the cast is excellent. This is truly the center piece of Stones trilogy on the 60's in America (this would include Platoon and The Doors).
This is also probably the last in the line of true political thrillers that mainstream Hollywood produced (beginning with Manchurian Candidate in the 60's, Three Days of the Condor, All The Presidents Men and The Paralax View in the 70's).",1471392000,,688,4.838983050847458

Sissy Spacek is so great as the woman with no sense of importance for what her husband is doing, I had to tell her to stop her complaining!  Other wonderful performances by my favorite Tommy Lee Jones and Kevin Bacon.  Gary Oldman is sufficiently creepy as Oswald.  Joe Pesci almost steels the show.  Great casting, screenplay by Oliver Stone and historical accuracy.  Or is it?  Oliver Stone took a huge risk, as I recall, in making this film as it questions the official Warren Commission conclusion of the lone gunman and a few other controversial theories.  Well worth a watch.  I think I'll watch for a fourth time.",1470960000,,754,4.723076923076923

95769,5,0790729733,"I saw this film the day it came out.  Since I had studied this case all of my adult life there was nothing in the film that was unknown to me. However Oliver Stone told Jim Garrison's story so brilliantly and flawlessly that I have seen the film several times in the intervening years.  I consider this one of the most important films ever made.  Star studded cast, with incredible acting by all. See it, and see it with your kids. True history is so important and Oliver Stone took a beating for daring to tell these truths.

95907,5,0790729733,"Director Oliver Stone threw out  the kitchen sink in this movie, meaning that he approached it from every possible conspiracy angle, which the critics panned. But this was deliberate said Stone. On November 22, 1963, the president of the United States was brutally assassinated while sitting next to his wife in the presidential motorcade in Dallas Texas. The Warren commission, which unbelievably included ex-CIA Director Alan Dulles, who had been fired by Kennedy sat on the Warren commission. The Warren commission asked the FBI to investigate. But anybody who has read the Warren commission report can easily see that there was no real investigation. It was simply decided that Lee Harvey Oswald would take the blame for the assassination as the lone gunman. This movie is full of facts that will chill your blood. Everything is wrong about the Warren commission's conclusions about the assassination, and Oliver Stone points this out with a sledgehammer. No matter what you believe, this movie is worth watching. It's a snapshot into how our government operated in 1963. And it's not pretty. Lee Harvey Oswald claimed that he had nothing to do with the assassination, but never made it out of the Dallas city jail and was himself assassinated by Jack Ruby, a known mobster in Dallas. To this day, Lee Harvey Oswald's tax records are classified on the grounds of national security. So are the couple that he lived with, before Lee Harvey took the job at the book depository. Their tax records are classified to this day as well. Now I'm certainly not trying to convince anyone of anything. Do your own investigation of the many documents that have been released and arrive at your own conclusions. But I highly recommend this movie for anybody who cares or is interested in a highly suspicious event that occurred that fateful day in Dallas.",1470009600,28,1845,4.951612903225806

Later findings still leave my mind open to conspiracy knowing how hard it is to hit a moving target with such accuracy. I don't believe the controversy will ever come to a conclusion in the lives my generation as we relive the event as if it were yesterday.

Who was actually behind it and who actually pulled the triggers will never be resolved but this film does a good job of providing a plausible explanation that helps bring the viewer a better understanding of why it happened.  Much like religion it is not important that you actually believe the stories of religious readings rather the stories are meant to help us understand our own existence and draw lessons from the experiences of others.  Taken in this context it is a very good film.,1465862400,,706,4.907563025210084

96147,5,0790729733,"Perhaps the very best film ever made about the JFK assassination.

Anyone who missed this film because of all the negative reviews in the mainstream press is missing out on a great film.

As a researcher myself into the events of 11/22/1963, I found the film presented the facts of the assassination as a coup d'etat, in a brilliant and convincing way.

The second disk with interviews of some of the principles was a delightful plus to this edition; especially the interview with Col Fletcher Prouty, perhaps THE most qualified expert on this event there has ever been.",1465257600,,570,4.795918367346939

It is a remarkably thorough recitation of the facts uncovered over years by him and his team. The film is more of a synopsis of the high points and presents just a small portion of the mountain of evidence they unearthed. There are some amazing tidbits that they left out -- information about Perry Russo's credible and consistent testimony; the federal judgeship Garrison was offered to quell the investigation; the 'real"" Mr. X; the effort to crush him with unfounded racketeering, bribery and tax evasion charges, all of which he beat in open court. Garrison's real fault was a naivete to believe that he ever had a chance, but that makes him even more of a compelling American practitioner of jurisprudence and lifelong student of the legal process.",1456876800,10,925,4.860759493670886

Just before JFK went to Dallas, and he knew in his heart he was going to be killed, he was on the path of peace with Kruschev.  When JFK died, the whole dream of peace died and the insiders and puppet masters of our government went ahead with war.  It is an amazing book.  When you read the part where it describes the CIA's plans to kill Castro.....it sounded exactly how 9-11 played out and I was just dumbfounded!  Yes, I do believe 9-11 was an inside job, don't believe it?  Do research yourself and don't listen to the regular news media outlets.

The acting was outstanding, movie did not lag even through it was three hours long.

96347,4,0790729733,"A lot of critics and moviegoers have given director Oliver Stone the unfair reputation of being a far-out, left-wing kook, a biased reporter who distorts everything he touches.  Admittedly, he has taken very personal points of view toward controversial subjects in several of his pictures like ""Platoon,"" ""Salvador,"" ""Wall Street,"" ""Talk Radio,"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July""; and he has been stylistically over-the-top in at least one picture, ""Natural Born Killers.""  But mostly Stone has been fair and balanced toward his subject matter in films like ""The Doors,"" ""Nixon,"" ""U Turn,"" ""Any Given Sunday,"" ""Alexander,"" ""World Trade Center,"" ""W,"" ""Savages,"" and others.  However, maybe the one picture that has done the most to brand Stone a nut job is 1991's ""JFK,"" the director's embracing of attorney Jim Garrison's conspiracy theory regarding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Did he or didn't he?  That is the question.  In 1964 the official Warren Commission report (chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren) concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating President John F. Kennedy.  Fifteen years later, the congressional House Select Committee on Assassinations reviewed the case and theorized that a conspiracy may have been behind Kennedy's death.  Since then, just about everybody has offered an opinion on the subject, with suspects ranging from the Mafia to the CIA, from the Russians to the Cubans, and even to Vice President Lyndon Johnson.

Director Oliver Stone and co-screenwriter Zachary Sklar based their movie on the books ""On the Trail of the Assassins"" by Jim Garrison and ""Crossfire:  The Plot That Killed Kennedy"" by Jim Marrs.  Since we may never get a definitive answer to the question of who killed the President, Garrison and Stone's ideas may be as good as any.  More important, it's a darned good movie, with this Blu-ray ""Director's Cut"" adding another quarter of a hour to the running time.

In thinking back on all the review comments I've read or heard about ""JFK"" over the years, one of the overriding negative criticisms has always been that Stone never ""proves"" his point in the film.  What this really sounds like to me is that many critics have a hard buying into any JFK conspiracy theory, and that that very fact has stopped them from simply enjoying the film as a film.  The way I look at it, the movie presents only one of several possible and well-known conspiracy theories, and it does so in a wonderfully thrilling manner.  What's more, the movie reminds me a lot of ""All the President's Men"" in that even though we know exactly how everything is going to turn out, the film offers a riveting mystery, anyhow.  So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the film as entertainment, if nothing else.  If it prompts you to question the ""official"" reports of the JFK assassination, all the better, whether you believe Garrison and Stone's account or not.  Then, if the movie goes on to prompt you to examine more carefully the things your government tells you, you might just make Stone proud.

Yes, ""JFK"" gets a little too preachy, with District Attorney Jim Garrison's closing argument probably going on too long; and yes, there are a few melodramatic moments that no doubt Stone (or Garrison) exaggerated for effect; and, yes, maybe we could have done without so much of Garrison's difficult home life distracting us from the main story.  But these minor blemishes hardly stop a viewer from appreciating the movie's major charms:  the accelerating tension, the suspense, and the sense of wonder and amazement it instills at the possible duplicity of so many real-life characters (to say nothing of the U.S. government).

Like Garrison's book, the movie features New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison as its central figure.  Remember, though, that the movie is a dramatization, not an autobiography or a documentary.  Neither Garrison nor Stone expects us to believe that everything happened in real life the way it does in the story.  But I'd say it's pretty close, with license for embellishment along the way.

Kevin Costner stars as Garrison, and given the actor's penchant for playing highly sincere, almost maddeningly decent human beings, he is a perfect fit for the high-minded public prosecutor.  Garrison thinks early on that something is fishy about the JFK assassination, but the killing took place in Dallas, Texas, and he's a D.A. in Louisiana, so he doesn't immediately get involved.  It takes him three years after the events of Dallas to begin putting pieces together that the Warren Commission seemed to have overlooked, and one of his chief suspects, Clay Shaw, is right there in New Orleans.  Garrison becomes compelled to act--an obsession, perhaps paranoidal, that almost loses him his wife and family.

He begins with the obvious:  Did anyone have reason to kill the President?  You bet.  In Kennedy's few years in office, he had become embroiled in the Bay of Pigs fiasco; in a fight against organized crime; in a war in Laos and Vietnam; and in the Cuban missile crisis, which involved both Cuba and Russia.  Moreover, the country had elected Kennedy by the slimmest margin in American history.  There were plenty of people who would liked to have seen him dead.

After that, Garrison began wondering why the government never followed up on so many leads in the case:  Why they didn't interrogate witnesses thoroughly.  Why the FBI and police questioned their chief suspect, Lee Harvey Oswald, for twelve hours after the assassination with no lawyer present and nobody recording Oswald's answers.  Why so many witnesses said the government had altered their testimonies in the final report.  And why no one took seriously Oswald's story of his being ""a patsy,"" a fall guy, even when a local nightclub owner and hoodlum, Jack Ruby, murdered Oswald in plain sight and on television, while Oswald was under guard!

Well, you can accept or reject Garrison and Stone's notions about a conspiracy, but it's hard to reject the capabilities of the supporting cast; they're all very, very good.  This would start with Sissy Spacek as Garrison's wife Liz.  While her husband is becoming ever more consumed by his desire to prosecute local entrepreneur Clay Shaw in a plot to kill the President, his wife just wants her husband to remember the family.  For a time, at least, she doesn't quite believe in him, and Spacek's portrayal reveals well that split in her allegiance.  Also good is Tommy Lee Jones as Shaw:  smooth, suave, and slimy.  And Jay O. Sanders and Michael Rooker as Garrison's top assistants; Kevin Bacon as a shadowy local figure associated with Shaw, a figure that Garrison hopes will be his star witness; and Gary Oldman (before he became as famous as he is today) as the accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, doing a more than credible job of impersonating the man.

In addition to the major supporting roles, though, Stone chose to fill out a number of cameo parts with well-known faces.  It's kind of a who's who of Hollywood, and it can be somewhat distracting from the seriousness of the rest of the movie.  For instance, you'll find Edward Asner, Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Walter Matthau, and others popping up for a few minutes and then disappearing.  ""Oh, look, there's so-and-so.""  I suppose I should give Stone the benefit of the doubt here and assume that he used these actors so we would distinctly remember each of the minor characters, who might otherwise go unnoticed in a cast so large.  Still, I found that, by and large, they took me out of the story line.

Stone's location shooting in Dallas, New Orleans, and Washington, DC, help establish and maintain the film's authenticity, even though, as I've said, he wasn't trying to make a documentary.  He also has the common sense to let a scene flow through to its end without interrupting it every three seconds with multiple-angle shots, quick edits, and camera changes, so we get a believable sense of ever-building excitement and uncertainty without resorting to artificial stimuli.

Admittedly, it's hard for a person to accept a JFK conspiracy theory when its proponents want us to believe its scope is so large that practically everyone in the country was in on it but John Wilkes Booth.  Still, if you can forget some of the hyperbole, ""JFK"" comes off as a first-rate mystery thriller.  (Garrison was the only person ever to bring a suspect to trial for the JFK assassination.)  You don't have to accept the evidence Garrison and Stone provide, but the way the filmmakers present it, it at least persuades you to believe that <i>something</i> untoward happened.  Garrison and Stone may not have made their case in ""JFK,"" but they planted a seed of doubt about the assassination that continues to this day.

Trivia note:  Look for the real Jim Garrison (who died a year or so after the completion of the film) in the small role of Chief Justice Earl Warren.  Given that Garrison looks reasonably like the man and that Garrison was a state Court of Appeals judge at the time he made the movie, the role is not really that much of a stretch for him.

John's film rating:  8/10.

Video:
Warner Bros. present the high-definition, Blu-ray Director's Cut of ""JFK"" in its original aspect ratio of 2.40:1 on a VC-1 encoded, dual-layer BD50 for maximum picture quality.  More important, WB engineers appear to reproduce the movie in almost the way the studio showed it in motion-picture theaters.  That is, the definition and color varies from scene to scene.  When the movie begins, we get a good deal of archival footage in black-and-white, warts and all.  When Oliver Stone's footage begins, it, too, looks almost like black-and-white, the color intentionally drained from the print and the focus softened.  As the film goes on, the video quality improves dramatically, becoming clearer, sharper, and brighter, the colors deeper and richer.  WB may have also applied a small degree of grain filtering, I don't know, but it is hardly noticeable and helps to maintain a consistent visual tone throughout the movie without upsetting the director's intent.

Here's Ranjan's view of the video quality:  Just as he did in ""Natural Born Killers,"" Oliver Stone switches between different styles from a documentary to a monochromatic look.  The image improves as the movie progresses.  No bright colors are seen during the first half of the movie.  However, blacks and contrasts are solid during this period.  The quality of the Blu-ray disc is clearly evident in the scene where Garrison is talking to Mr. X in a park.  The skin tones are just fine, colors are bright, and edges are sharp.  Overall, a great transfer.

Audio:
Definitely, choose the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 option if you can play it back.  It is smoother and better defined than the regular Dolby Digital track that also accompanies the movie.  In TrueHD you'll find the movie utilizing the surrounds to excellent advantage, with not only a good deal of ambient musical bloom in the rear  channels but gunshots and environmental noises as well--rain, wind, thunder, cars, dogs, and such.  Good dynamics, a reasonably well-extended frequency response, a deep bass, and realistically rendered dialogue all combine to make this drama more impressive than you might think.

Extras:
Not only do you get the three-and-and-half hour Director's Cut on the disc, you get a flock of standard-definition extras as well.  First off, there's an audio commentary by director Oliver Stone that is something of a must for conspiracy-theory fans as well as film buffs.  After that is a ninety-minute documentary, ""Beyond JFK:  The Question of Conspiracy,"" made in 1992, that presents some of the pros and cons of the various theories.  Next, there are twelve deleted and extended scenes, including an alternate ending, with optional director commentary, lasting about fifty-five minutes total.  Then, there are two multimedia essays, ""Assassination Updated,"" thirty minutes, and ""Meet Mr. X:  The Personality and Thoughts of Fletcher Prouty,"" eleven minutes.

The bonus materials conclude with a remarkable eighty-eight scene selections (I believe the most I've ever seen on a disc); a widescreen theatrical trailer (1.78:1 ratio); English and French spoken languages; and French subtitles, with English captions for the hearing impaired.  You'll find the disc enclosed in the back of one of Warner Bros.' Digibook packages, basically a hardbound book containing thirty-eight pages of text and pictures on the movie.

Parting Thoughts:
The best compliment I can pay to Oliver Stone and his ""JFK"" movie is that almost three-and-a-half hours went by in what seemed like half that time.  Stone never makes the case that Clay Shaw was guilty of anything any more than Garrison did at the trial, but both Garrison and Stone plant the seeds of doubt in the nation's mind that maybe, just maybe, the U.S. government was covering something up.  As the movie's preface declares in a quote from Ella Wheeler Wilcox, ""To sin by silence when we should protest makes cowards of men.""  We must commend Garrison and Stone for asking the right questions and Stone for making so eye-opening and entertaining a picture.",1433808000,,13230,4.99634703196347

The only true information presented in this film is that there was a DA in New Orleans named Jim Garrison who tried Clay Shaw for conspiracy to kill Kennedy and lost, everything else is fluff.

That being said, I do say this is a good movie for what it's worth but its trick is that it convinces its audiences that it's the truth.  Like in ""The Usual Suspects"" the best trick the Devil ever pulled was in convincing the world that he didn't exist.  The best trick Oliver Stone ever pulled was in convincing the world that Jim Garrison was correct in prosecuting an innocent man.  According to Stone, prosecuting an innocent man is just fine as long as it raises some questions -- about an event that we already have the answer to.

As comic Mort Sahl once joked, this movie is like a guy telling famed Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal, ""The good news is that Oliver Stone wants to do a movie on your life.  The bad news is that Kevin Costner is going to play Hitler.""  This film is a great example of art imitating life but we have to remind ourselves that IMITATION is NOT REAL!

To take this film as a serious representation of the facts of the Kennedy case is a desecration to intelligence.  I view this film, not as a drama, but as a comedy of errors.

96371,5,0790729733,"Jesus Christ was betrayed and sold out for 30 pieces of silver, by the treacherous Apostle: Judas Iscariot. Julius Caesar was betrayed and stabbed to death, by his wayward, so-called friend: Brutus and by others. George Washington, the Continental Army, the American People and a budding, new Nation, called: The United States of America, was betrayed by one of it's Major General's', named: Benedict Arnold. And, centuries later, an American President by the name of: John Fitzgerald Kennedy/JFK for short..., was betrayed and brutally murdered... needlessly, by a former United States Marine, named: Lee Harvey Oswald. However, Oswald adamantly maintained that which scores of Americans also thought..., that Oswald was not alone, in this heinous endeavor. Multitudes claim, that the CIA, the FBI, Castro and his cronies, Russian Communists, the Mafia and the Secret Service..., had come against and betrayed the President of the United States/JFK, too silence him by way of a horrific assassination. The question that everybody was asking: ""Was it a conspiracy?"" Many believe, that it was. Why? Because, with all the rightful protection that is afforded to the President of the United States, it is difficult to imagine that a lone gunman can penetrate and successfully gun down, an American President. Particularly since, the infamous Zapruta Film (the actual and documented) film footage of that tragic and unimaginable day - November 22, 1963, clearly depicts with both sight and sound, and which crowds of eye-witnesses attested too, that several gunshots were heard from different directions as JFK's Motorcade was passing by. Another reason why so many Americans suspect a conspiracy, is because of the entrenched bureaucracy in Washington D.C., that was at odds with the President. At the time, the overwhelming majority of society, felt that the seemingly unmovable ""sacred cows"" felt threatened by the changes that President Kennedy advocated. And, because Kennedy represented dramatic change and a dismantling of the established status quo, he was met with fierce bureaucratic resistance. When the pressure to conform didn't sway JFK then..., as many contend, things got a lot more physical. How so? Specifically, in the form of secret operatives, which was called: ""Operation Mongoose."" Which were allegedly put into affect and carried out by what were called: ""The Black Operatives"" (Washington, insider's). Long story short, many contend that JFK was hung out to dry, by his own. How? By misinforming and steering him in the wrong direction such as the Bay of Pig's disaster, and the continued sabotaging of his implemented agenda's. And, when that didn't work, they scape-goated and sacrificed their Leader. The President of the United States: John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Who, at the time, was the most powerful man on the face of the Earth. However, JFK wasn't just sacrificed for his title and position on controversial issues, such as the Vietnam War. No. He was destroyed, as a human being. Annihilated, as a man. And obliterated, as a President of a People and a Nation. But, even his death, could not wipe out... what history, had recorded. Yes, the 'Prince of Camelot' was dismissed, and then, removed by assassination. And so, on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas, a 46-year old President of the United States, paid the ultimate price. JFK/John Fitzgerald Kennedy was brutally eliminated (1917-1963). God rest his soul! And supposedly, by a lone gunman, named: Lee Harvey Oswald. Or was Oswald just a ""...patsy..."", as he alleged? So, the obvious question, remains: Was he truly the only gunman who fired off several bullets that struck the President's Motorcade from three different angles? And, which hit other's within the President's Car, besides the President, himself?! Pause and think about that one..., if you will! Does that sound like a lone gunman, too you?? Supposedly, one shotgun shot-off several bullets at the same time from three different angles and all from one, lone gunman. Hmm?! Or the other alternative, was that it was a conspiracy of gargantuan proportions? Perhaps, it was the powerful and widespread Mafia? Or was it the Russian Communists who faced off with JFK in a nuclear crisis? And, what about the Cuban Communist Dictator: Fidel Castro and the  Bay of Pig's disaster? Which was blamed on but not initiated, by JFK? While yet others, are convinced that for something of this magnitude to have taken place, surely... the CIA, the FBI and the Secret Service who were supposed to protect the President, had too be in on it. Others wise, how could they have gotten too him? Somebody in Washington D.C., had to have had at least a clue..., that their Commander-in-Chief was about to be assassinated?! But, who was in league with whom? Enter... the justice-minded, City of New Orleans, Louisiana, District Attorney (D.A.): Jim Garrison. Who courageously, said: ""Let justice be done, though the heaven's fall!"" He, like so many others, didn't buy the Warren Commission's' finding, of the 'Lone Bullet' Theory. In that, a single bullet can go through the President's head, then through his neck, then zig-zag right and left and up and through the passenger within the front seat of the same car. Somehow, as per the Law of Gravity and Common Sense, even to a lay person who knows nothing about guns, ballistic projections or the trajectory track of a firearm, the whole 'one bullet and one gunman' theory for so much damage just doesn't sound credible, let alone, plausible. In addition too, the fact that the key eye-witnesses on record, who contradicted the 'Lone Bullet Theory', were all suddenly and mysteriously dying, being killed or having the sudden urge to commit suicide one right after another, and all within a short period of time. And, oddly enough, all the investigative files and especially the Warren Commission's finding, were closed-off to the public until the year 2038 a.d.. From all aspects, one can't help but wonder, why?! Further, the D.A. Jim Garrison, knew that a single bullet from the Dallas Book Depository could not have been the sole cause for the President's death, because Oswald was listed as a ""bad shot"" when he was in active military duty. And, the few local documented eye-witness testimony's and Dallas Police Reports that were made available, were mostly 'blacked out', so that one was not able to read the eye-witness accounts, in their entirety. Some other things stuck out, as well. Namely, a prominent New Orleans businessman, who was domestically and internationally wheeling and dealing with a variety of individuals that were questionable..., had no regard for America, it's government and definitely had no love for JFK, himself. And, this businessman's' personal dealings close to home, were shady at best. And somehow, whether at home or abroad, he was connected too all of the associate player's who at one time or another, had publicly stated that they wanted too see Kennedy, dead. And, as this compelling film points out, key figures from within the Washington D.C., circuit pointed out, that the ""...old war horses within the Pentagon were hell bent on sending troops into Vietnam, because war is a money-making machine which President Kennedy was vehemently, opposed too!"" Yet and still, taking all of this into consideration, Jim Garrison was not intimidated and went on to be the only one who ever bothered too put all of these overwhelming factors and clues together (outside of the Washington D.C. showcase sham...!#?!#!), and legally challenge the Warren Commission's' ""finding."" How? By putting on trial, all who were still alive, too testify. Courageous Director: Oliver Stone, in this riveting and very deeply moving, 205-minute, color, 2-disc, DVD version, starring Academy Award winning Actor: Kevin Costner, in the title role of D.A. Jim Garrison, put his career and reputation on the line, in directing this powerful yet disturbing film. He faced an apprehensive and even hostile Hollywood and a more edgy and suspicious Washington D.C., for daring to bring the shocking truth and revelation contained within this magnificent motion picture, too the public's attention on the big-screen. And, Warner Brothers bravely stood their ground, as they backed up their Director: Oliver Stone. And, as a bonus, this mesmerizing epic that is based upon actual legal and historical accounts, depicts the insightful Documentary: ""Beyond JFK - The Question of Conspiracy."" Also included, are the extended and deleted scenes, which are based upon all of the cumulative facts. This blockbuster movie is very intense, illuminating and again, very deeply moving. In short, this film is brilliant! But, due to the subject matter, language and sexual content, it should be seen by mature audiences only. From start to finish, this 2-disc, extended DVD version of JFK, which also includes the historic yet horrific ""Zapruta Film"" which depicts the actual assassination of President Kennedy, is a definite keeper. But, keep the tissue box handy, as you watch this emotionally charged, educational and entertaining, historical drama, unfold. Nina Kish",1427760000,,9146,5.204884667571235

Most has probably been redacted then copied with originals destroyed so no names will ever be released.  With all the power and money that the Kennedy's as a family has/had, I cannot believe that they didn't know the truth some time ago and have only their secrets.  The Kennedy family has/had many secrets to keep as most families that have money and are involved in politics.  If we go back even before America became a nation, politics were involved, conspiracies, etc., nothing has changed; only the men and women at the top, but the stories remain the same.  I applaud Stone for doing his due diligence and this film.  I wish he would do more.  I have no doubt that the government has hid so much from its citizens.

96388,2,0790729733,"""JFK""  is a film that always elicits from me a bevy of strong emotions, both positive and negative.  It's a film I've viewed many times, and every time I've watched it,  I've  come away both loving it and hating it in equal measure.  I've never been able to decide whether it's  a bad ""good"" movie, or a good ""bad"" movie...

Why the ambivalence? ""JFK""  is certainly (for the most part)  a well-acted film with a strong ensemble cast that includes Kevin Costner, Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James Cromwell, Michael Rooker, and many other notable actors. The screenplay written  by Oliver Stone  is well-crafted, taut, tense, and fascinating. The cinematography, music, and special effects are all superb. The video and audio quality of the film's Blu-ray versions are all first-rate. ""JFK"" never fails to hold my interest from start to finish. From all these standpoints, I think ""JFK"" is an outstanding film.

But I have two major gripes that almost ruin ""JFK"" for me. First of all is Kevin Costner, whom I believe was totally miscast for the part of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. I remember Garrison from newsreel footage as a very tall, physically imposing man with an intimidating, ""in-your-face"" personality. In ""JFK,"" Costner completely fails to capture Garrison's essence. I've always considered Costner a mediocre actor at best,  and usually at his worst while woodenly mumbling his dialogue without a hint of emotion;  in ""JFK,""  he is even worse  than usual (bordering on absolutely terrible), woodenly  mumbling  his dialogue without a hint of emotion,  all the while making an absolutely atrocious attempt at a Southern accent.

My second gripe:  Oliver Stone, who both directed the film and wrote its screenplay,  hypothesizes an assassination  conspiracy theory that makes absolutely no sense to me.  Stone's contention seems to be that JFK was murdered by a combination of Mafia dons, CIA agents, army generals, Cuban expatriates, right wing extremists, and Lee Harvey Oswald... all under the aegis of none other than the 36th President of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson!  To me, Stone's hypothesis seems like an attempt to please everyone who (like me) believes that Oswald did not act alone in murdering JFK.  I think Oliver Stone would have been much better served if he had focused on one specific conspiracy theory (for example, the CIA/Mafia connection, which I've always thought makes the most sense) and explained it in detail.

Stone's muddled, ""let's-throw-mud-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks"" conspiracy theory has gained so much traction over the years that it has somehow become, in many circles, the de facto account of how JFK met his death in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. From that perspective, Stone has, in effect, rewritten history. I think viewers of ""JFK"" would be prudent to remember that the version of events shown in the film is only one filmmaker's grand speculation, based his own interpretation of history, and not a history lesson in itself. Recommended, but only with strong reservations.",1424822400,2,3085,5.167338709677419

96405,5,0790729733,"I have refrained from writing a review about JFK because honestly I feel like there are enough opinions (most of them way off base IMHO) floating around to fill up several volumes and most of them are contradictory. But I do love this film and so I thought I might as well chime in with my 2 cents

 I have been involved in my own research on the subject of JFK's assassination for over twenty years now. For me it began with the reading of Mark Lane's ""Plausible Denial"" around 1991-92 when it was published. I was in college at the time and saw it on display in my school's library in the new book section. I can barely remember what my thoughts were on the subject prior to reading that book, but it was the beginning for me to search out as much as I could find to research the story further. It was so different in those pre-internet days to research a subject like this, my college library being the best source I had.

After graduating I slowed down on my research and was quite occupied with my life and career for a number of years, not losing interest, but more running out of good material to read. Then in 2005 a friend gave me a copy of ""The Assassinations"" published by Feral House. He marked a chapter titled ""Who or what was Lee Harvey Oswald?"". This was my introduction to the findings of ""Probe"" magazine regarding the case for two Oswalds which I had never heard about. It was also my introduction to the writings of Lisa Pease and James Dieugenio (see his lastest book ""Reclaiming Parkland"" for an excellant critique of the Tom Hanks whitewash film ""Parkland"").

Since that time when I read ""The Assassinations"" I have been steadily reading and researching JFK's history changing murder. And leading up to the 50th anniversary in 2013 there has been a number of great books that focus on specific aspects of the plot to kill Kennedy. Some stand outs for me have been Jim Douglasses ""JFK and the Unspeakable"" Peter Janney's ""Mary's Mosaic"" about the death of JFK mistress Mary Meyer Pinchot, and ""Double Cross"" the story of Sam Giancana as told by his brother and godson. In fact those three books alone go a long ways towards answering some of the most important questions about JFK's murder.

This leads me up to Oliver Stone's film JFK. I remember reading an early interview with Stone wherein he explains that because of the complexity of the plot to kill JFK, what he did with his film was to portray as many of the relevant theories that he could tie into the New Orleans chapter of Oswald's life that summer of 1963 using the Garrison case as the focal point to tell the story of how and why he brought Clay Shaw to trial. I think it is an incredibly well made film that provokes the viewer to think about all of the evidence that runs contrary to the Warren Commision findings. From the opening scene of Rose Cheramie being thrown out of the car with Sergio Aracha Smith and his Cuban cohorts while on route from Miami to Dallas to Oswald handing out leaflets with Guy Bannister's office adress stamped on them to CIA asset Jim Sheridans smearing of Jim Garrison's reputation on national TV....these events are factual. What ever flaws people find in other parts of the story as far as it not being historically accurate I think completely are missing the point. As I've read here in other reviews about the film ""JFK"" , Stone's version is a lot closer to the truth than the Warren Commision  28 volumes of distractions that serve to cover up the truth and to ignore and not even interview so many of the eye witnesses who were there in Dealy Plaza that day.",1421366400,3,3585,4.49079754601227

Tommy Lee Jones was perfect as the arrogant, elitist fascist who knew he would never see the inside of a prison cell. Gary Oldman almost made you feel sorry for Lee Harvey Oswald as the fall-guy.  And who knew Joe Pesci could effectively portray someone other than a Mafia hoodlum?  This is clearly Oliver Stone's best movie.  It is his directorial masterpiece.

on who was responsible for the 11/22/63 murder of President John F. Kennedy.

A world class cast and Stone's fine script make a serious case for a coup d'etat, with Vice President Lyndon Johnson and the DC power structure the beneficiaries. What can't be argued is that America's complete involvement in Vietnam can be traced back not to JFK but to his successor.

Highlight of this compelling drama (I have the Director's cut) is Kevin Costner's nearly half-hour courtroom soliloquy (as New Orleans DA Jim Garrison), as he lays out evidence that Lee Oswald was not a lone nut assassin. Key to the prosecution's case against supposed ex-CIA man Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) is the Zapruder film, enhanced here so that the fatal shot is almost impossible to watch without cringing. Costner is simply brilliant in this crucial part of the story. His emotional final thoughts make for one the greatest scenes in cinematic history.

While many more documents and evidential tests have become available since Garrison waded off into this fascinating terrirory, the JFK assassination is still a mystery, and perhaps it always will be.

The movie itself is very good. The courtroom scene did not depict a case against Clay so much as it presents the theory Garrison arrived at in 1969.  While thinking that this is a Hollywood dramatization to enhance the entertainment factor, I would certainly like to know how it really played out in court. If nothing else, it has given me reason to explore the history of an event that happened when I was in grade school. Being a child at the time, I never really grasped the immensity of this incredible occurance in American history, but am quite intent on doing so now.",1411171200,,926,4.775

In 1991, Oliver Stone's JFK popularized a version of President Kennedy's assassination that featured U.S. government agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the military as conspirators. While the movie was largely fictional, the information that Stone conveyed in the movie's closing trailer was true: the HSCA had reinvestigated the murder and issued a provocative report, but their records were sealed until the year 2029. Stone suggested at the end of JFK that Americans could not trust official public conclusions when those conclusions had been made in secret. Congress passed legislation the JFK Act that released the secret records that prior investigations gathered and created.

Kennedy, The JFK Act, Investigations, FBI and CIA, Zapruder Film, Medical and Ballistics, Critics (Kindle Locations 722-728). Progressive Management. Kindle Edition.

""Oliver Stone called for the remaining CIA and FBI documents pertaining to the assassination of Kennedy to be released. Clifford Krauss, reported in the New York Times that members of the Kennedy family supported this move. (106) The historian, Stephen Ambrose, argued that ""the crime of the century is too important to be allowed to remain unsolved and too complex to be left in the hands of Hollywood movie makers."" (107) Louis Stokes, who had chaired the House Select Committee on Assassinations, also called for the files to be unclassified. (108) The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, or the JFK Records Act, was passed by the United States Congress, and became effective on 26th October, 1992. The Act requires that each assassination record be publicly disclosed in full, and be available in the collection no later than the date that is 25 years after the date of enactment of the Act (October 26, 2017), unless the President of the United States certifies that: (1) continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and (2) the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.""

I think it would be reasonable to ask why the hell all of this nasty stuff was classified/covered up in the first place presenting a mature justification to question the honesty of the Warren Report.

96471,5,0790729733,"JFK is a three-hour film that takes a closer look at the events leading to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22,1963 and the alleged subsequent cover-up by different government agencies in the eyes of the later former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison.

This docudrama accounts on the mysteries behind JFK's assassination and the investigation of the murder conducted under the guidance of Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren that is known as a the Warren Commission which conclusion of a lone assassin in Lee Harvey Oswald distressed many observers. In it,Garrison pointed out a lot of inconsistencies and flaws of the Warren Commission and made an investigation on his own wherein a number of an unimaginable number of plausible conspiracy theories that involved Lyndon Baines Johnson,the next president of the United States, the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia. Over the course of gathering what he believes to be evidence of a conspiracy, Garrison unveils some of the grittier aspects of New Orleans society,focusing on the shady activities of Clay Shaw.

This came out to be one of the most compelling and controversial films ever to emerge from American cinema. Regardless if you believe what the film pointed out or not,I still commend it for its honest search for truth. The performances by cast particularly Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones were phenomenal. The direction by Oliver Stone was superb as it was a great ride of both information and propaganda as it three hour length seemed quite short in this docudrama. The Director's Cut provided the viewer with a lot more information as compared to the theatrical release. This film has become a masterpiece and it will definitely spark debates as to whether Oswald acted alone or there was a conspiracy involved.",1408406400,,1817,5.073578595317726

96474,5,0790729733,"Well, where to start with this whopper of a film?  I like how Roger Ebert summed it, ""the achievement of the film is not that it answers the mystery of the Kennedy assassination, because it does not, or even that it vindicates Garrison, who is seen here as a man often whistling in the dark. Its achievement is that it tries to marshal the anger which ever since 1963 has been gnawing away on some dark shelf of the national psyche.""

Personally, I think of many of the film's theories as crackpot journalism, an alternative history to real events.  In fact, the movie briefly, and insanely, alleges Lyndon Johnson had a hand in the Kennedy assassination, or at least was a proponent of the idea in theory.

However, this does not necessarily mean we should condemn this seeking of higher truth the film aspires to.  In fact, that I admire about JFK.  Hell, I don't agree with everything Howard Zinn used to say as a historian, but I found his voice to be healthy and essential to the debate in this country.  How could any of this possibly hurt us, this alternative and speculative way of thinking?

As Ebert also says in his review, the film is full of urgency and anger.  And he's right: it feels like Stone is ferociously throwing everything he ever wanted to say or do at the screen and its viewers, and seeing what sticks.

Technically speaking, it's a marvel to watch.  The editing--by Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia-- compiles documentary footage, 8mm and 35 mm dramatizations and re-enactments of real events to head-swirling effect.  It's something to see for that aspect alone.  It must've been a monster to compile and edit all this film together.

Addendum 3/1/15:
However, the film assertsI think accuratelythat Americas intelligence agencies, with their undisclosed budgets and lack of congressional oversight since the 1950s, have wrought havoc, instability and mayhem throughout the world to ensure its own military, economic and political power worldwide.  If you don't believe this to be true, I suggest you look at Legacy of Ashes: A History of The CIA, by Pulitzer Prize winner Tim Weiner.

The creation of the C.I.A., N.S.A, and the F.B.I. has had both successful and disastrous consequences for the United States.  JFK is the best example, no matter how paranoid and preposterous the film becomes, of Americas employ of a kinder, gentler, and invisible, machine gun hand to secure its own empire, initiated by officials in the dimly lit back rooms of our political establishments.

In other words, it describes what Eisenhower called, a Military Industrial Complexa term broadly used to represent a network or collusion between U.S. Congress, The Pentagon, weapons corporations and defense contractors.  A relationship that critics claim, arguably, keeps the United States in a perpetual state of war, aggression and fear, which it also benefits and profits from it.

In fact the film begins with Eisenhowers quote in his farewell address in 1961: we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the militaryindustrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.

Contrast that against the films other opening words from a speech by John F. Kennedy in 1963 and I think you will understand its' intention and grand ambition: ""What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a Pax-Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their childrennot merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.""",1408233600,17,3946,4.868460388639761

96478,4,0790729733,"You know, this movie seemed better-founded to me, more than 20 years after its release, than it did when I saw it in the theater. Part of it was that I was influenced by the media firestorm on its release -- how awful it was that Oliver Stone dared to challenge orthodox thought on the JFK assassination! How dare he lionize New Orleans prosecutor Garrison, who was vilified as a charlatan in his day? And how could he accuse people at the highest levels of government -- maybe even LBJ himself -- of being involved in the conspiracy?

Well, time has made me a little kinder, and I can appreciate the movie for what it really was -- a dramatic telling of one popular theory for assassination. Let's face it, a lot of facts just don't fit the official lone-gunman theory. Oh, I know there are nitpickers who challenge this detail or that detail, this witness or that witness, but let's acknowledge that this is a movie that tries to present the grand sweep. As such it does a good job of presenting the theory that military/intelligence hardliners had quite enough of JFK and wanted him out in the worst way.

At the same time, it does a pretty good job of telling Garrison's story, too.

 Part of the reason I sought this out was that I had just watched ""Oliver Stone's Secret History of the United States,"" a multipart documentary that goes into this idea in quite a bit more depth. The Kennedy assassination is really just one episode in a longtime establishment effort to marginalize and neutralize the Soviet Union, with disastrous consequences for the world -- or so Stone argues. Most of it I have trouble swallowing, because it is predicated on the idea that the Soviet Union was a peaceful nation that wanted only to extend the olive branch -- pretty naive in my book. I think of all the people murdered by Stalin and shudder. No, the Soviet Union did not share the same moral sense, and while we were guilty of some nasty business, we at least hold ourselves to higher ideals -- the Soviet Union of that period did not.

But you know, if you isolate the one little story of the Kennedy assassination, and you know a little of the history of the American military and intelligence complex, there does seem to be some plausibility.

So think of it as a movie that presents a theory. You know, I read a book a while back in which Sherlock Holmes advances to modern times and visits Dallas and reviews the evidence and concludes the lone-gunman theory doesn't work -- ""The Case of the Murdered President."" A fun book, if gimmicky. This one works on the same level, a movie aimed really to serve an expository function that, oh, BTW, works as a movie, too.

The director's cut seems a little more rounded than the version I saw in the theater. I rate with four stars out of five only because there are no extras other than Stone's commentary -- apparently there was a two-disk version with more goodies, but that doesn't seem to be available now.",1407369600,5,2950,4.523452157598499

I followed the headlines and the story in the Washington Post and Television newscasts during that time with a lot of interest. I just think Richard Helms (Director of the CIA) became the ""scape goat"" and the ""FBI"" was a lot more involved than the american public will ever know. When you follow the real reporting of the entire scope in the killing of President Kennedy and what unfolded you'll recongnize this was really internal politics and mangement from ""Dallas to Washington"" at it's worst in United States history.

Stone isn't the first director to question the concept of History, but he must be the only director who ever made a self-reflexive historical drama that succeeded with the crowds and the critics.

The questions he posed in this movie are still relevant. What is history? Who decides what history is? What and who are the subject of history? Does history happen to groups or individuals? And so on.

Yes, the movie's conspiracy theories are outlandish and improbable. Stone also throws in his usual overdose of profanity and epithets. Faults notwithstanding, though, it might be the only Oliver Stone movie I consistently like and admire.",1405641600,,916,5.267123287671233

96508,5,0790729733,"still about 30 movies in one...but this new ""cut"" really cuts deep...we now how a ""storyline"".

the Director engages some very big names to support Kostner: strong performances by many movie and TV stars of the 1990s > esp. Joe Pesci as David Ferrie (some where between GOODFELLAS and CASINO, but in a completely different character); Donald Sutherland, in an ""invented"" character, who arrives late in the story, with the best written scene in the whole movie; Laurie Metcalf as an investigator, from ROSEANNE; and, Wayne Knight, from SEINFELD.

Stone starts his film with public statements by Republican Eisenhower and Democrat Kennedy, about how the USA war machine must bear oversight > the kind of ""material"" that the John Birch Society (then) and the Tea Party (now) used and use to label people ""Commees"".

ultimately, this is a story with no end....there was only an official opinion as to the guilt of LHO, that of enemies of JFK empowered to find the ""truth""...only FBI approved documents to be surveyed. since 1991, we have learned that the CIA kept a non-civilian file on LHO...and both pro-Warren and pro-Conspiracy buffs cannot determine if that bullet hole in the windshield *was* such or a hole from a bullet fragment...we have new details on the ""explosive"" nature of the kind of bullet that killed JFK, not the kind used in the 1944 weapon. and even pro-Conspiracy people do not emphasize the fact that there is no evidence LHO was at the 6th floor window as Kennedy passed.

new researchers may feel cheated by no mention of the Paines, a CIA family who helped the Oswalds to find a place to live and work. and no mention of ""John Birch"" follower, Joseph Milteer, who said on an undercover tape that the event was ""in the working"" and who was seen far from home..at Dealey Plaza...bout three weeks later. finally, no mention of Judy Vary Baker, a cancer researcher who has claimed she knew Oswald, Ferrie, and Ruby!

finally, we must recognize a fine acting job by Kostner but for all those youtubers who have watched speeches and interviews with the real JG (esp. his incredible 1968 appearance on Johnny Carson), he bears next to no *physical* resemblance to the imposing, bass-voiced N. O. D. A., not that it should be a negative. note: Jim Garrison himself, has a small part!

this film is based upon CROSS FIRE by Jim Marrs. not to play spoiler for the younger aficionados but that book *title* really holds the answer, for many.

disc two is fascinating, esp. for the buffs: many people from the MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY documentary show up three years later, and really ""sold"" this reviewer with their recollections. a stand-alone item, which is another huge impetus to include this Special Edition in a collection.",1402099200,,2738,4.825159914712153

96511,5,0790729733,IMO this film is the best version of the JFK assassination and certainly it contains more truth than the fictional Warren Commission. 5 Stars. Peter Dale Scott is the best written author on the subject.,1400284800,,202,4.8
96512,1,0790729733,"Note: I saw the theatrical cut of the picture in HD via XFinity On Demand.

JFK is a long, bloated, erotic and pointless mess of a movie that goes nowhere. Yes, it's got an excellent cast, but that's about it. The film purports to show numerous theories surrounding the assasination of President Kennedy in 1963, but in the end, it all boils down to 'A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.' I didn't like the numerous uses of a certain religious profanity, and at times, I felt like I was watching Scarface (1983) all over again, which I swore I'd never do. There are also several nasty scenes which imply homosexuality, and they served no purpose whatsoever other than to highlight that particular abomination. I think the closet queens in the film are fictitious characters, as is X, played by Donald Sutherland. How typical of Oliver Stone, 'Twisting facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts.' Just like J. Edgar, JFK is a waste of time.

Rated R for strong language, including frequent use of a religious profanity, and nasty homosexual content.",1399420800,5,1095,4.757894736842105

96515,2,0790729733,"At one point Costner as Garrison argues that they are looking ""through the looking-glass.""  Indeed they are.  One half expects Garrison to point the dreaded finger at Twiddle Dee and Tweedle Dum.  or Srone, through a close reading as only he could perform it, claiming that ""The Walrus and The Carpenter"" is a veiled allusion to the CIA and Cubans (whether pro or anti Castro is hardly material) killing Kennedy (disguised here as oysters).
  The film's title alone is misleading as the film is emphatically not about Kennedy much less any achievements he may have had while president.  A more appropriate title would be ""Notes Towards A Supreme Fiction"" (with apologies to Wallace Stevens).  Oh yes, the film is highly stylized and expertly directed - it boasts an energy that is almost overwhelming.  That, alas, is the problem.  Some will be taken in by the style and not give a second thought to the ridiculousness of the plot (or lack of one).  Garrison was a brutal, ambitious blowhard who set about trying to make a name for himself by indicting those who he felt were corrupt citizens of New Orleans.  Even those who believe in a conspiracy find it difficult to take Mr. G's theories seriously.
  Even as fiction the plot is as unbelievable as ""The Hobbit"" is unbelievable - yet the latter at least makes no pretentions to being true.  Too, Tolkein's masterpiece touches us because the hobbits and their playmates have a nature not unlike our own.  Not so in Stone's polemic.  Has there ever been anyone as sanctimonious, as self-righteous as Costner's Garrison?  He fairly drips with the moral certitude usually found in psychotics.  Anyone who questions him is labeled ""naive"" or ""dangerous"".
  The picture the film paints of JFK as a lovable ""Mr. Smith"" who goes to Washington with nothing but the highest of ideals is not borne out by the facts.  Yes, but what do any facts have to do with the matter?  As the White Knight tells Alice, ""It is my own invention"".  Yes, and this is Stone's.  JFK was a cold warrior, not a pacifist who sent the military into Vietnam with every intention to bring them home a few days later.
  Does it even occur to Stone that fifty years after the terrible day in Dallas not ONE person has come forward claiming to have any information comcerning a conspiracy, that not one person has died leaving behind a will with any such information, that not one scrap of evidence has been unearthed that points to anyone being the shooter other than Oswald?, who, in this version of events, is a hapless idiot who would not hurt a fly, not because of any virtue inside of him, but simply because he'd need someone to show him how.  The gist is that the only one in Dallas or New Orleans (and perhaps a five hundred mile radius around them) that did not have anything to do with the assassination was Lee Harvey Oswald.
  This is serious ladies and gentlemen.  There are many whose perception of the events will be based solely on this film, people who cannot be bothered reading books on the subject, people easily swayed by the sleight of hand Stone is so expert at, people who believe that Shakespeare's plays were written by Ernest Hemingway, and that soy is a commie conspiracy. Oh wait, it isn't, is it?
  In his film ""Nixon"" Stone has a scene in which some oil bigshots try to convince Nixon to run for president in 64.  When he refuses by saying that Kennedy will no doubt win, the camera shifts to two airheaded prostitutes playing pool, one of whom raises her finger to her mouth as if to say ""Don't let's let Nixon know what we know"" which is presumably that Kennedy will not win as he will be shot.  Yes, even prostitutes were in on the game.  PUHLEEZE!

A Beautiful mind, Braveheart, The Sound of Music,Remember the Titans,  & Hoosiers, all these movies take the facts as starting points, and in some cases (Braveheart) are half Fantasy.

96562,4,0790729733,"JFK is one of those films whose impact never diminishes, even after two decades since its initial release. In the wake of the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination, Oliver Stone's claim that the whole event was deliberately engineered by an unholy alliance of the government, the CIA, FBI and other institutions, cannot be readily dismissed. In terms of filmmaking, JFK is cleverly structured as a quest-narrative, with Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) gradually discovering more and more details about the assassination, and the various cover-ups that followed, while being continually frustrated in his task by obstructive institutions and/or individuals. It is a testament to his tenacity that he does not give up. In the final sequence he offers a tour de force in court as he presents his evidence at the trial of Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), whom he suspects of being a CIA agent. We already know the outcome of the trial, but Garrison's case is convincing nonetheless. Director Oliver Stone skillfully blends archive footage, black-and-white re-enactments of important events and color film to create a narrative which, although over two and a half hours in length, never fails to hold our attention. He is helped out by a clutch of excellent performances, notably from Costner (easily his finest hour in the cinema), Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek and - in cameo roles - Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.

I'm sure people believe this movie is all fact, but it is a lot of fiction, but a great movie. Very well-done. I always like movies done in the past, just to see the way things were. While this was a tragic event, I'm too young, and wasn't born. But just in contrast to see how people reacted to JFK, and how people reacted with 9/11, it really made you understand it better, and how tragic it was.

96577,5,0790729733,"Well, all of YOU may not realize it and get lost in Oliver Stone's controversial vision. It is a pastiche - a collage - but I can tell you as a longtime Kennedy researcher and everything in the movie is real and accurate and factual and happened - EXCEPT for the meeting with Donald Sutherland in Washington - that never happened. Jim Garrison did not have a 'Deep Throat' to help him or guide his way, and his self-aggrandizing manner is not even touched on in the movie - the main reason he was so discredited and dismissed as a crank just trying to get publicity for himself - it was the way he went about it - and if you read some of his quotes, they do this movie no service. But Oliver Stone does not know who killed JFK - he just knows how it DIDNT happen, that our own government lied to us and covered it up, and that we are ALL owed as Americans to know who killed our president and why. When the National Archives are finally opened up and we can see all of the thousands (seriously, literally, guys, if you don't know look it up) of documents that are STILL deemed 'too sensitive' for us to see and interpret ourselves - lest we get the wrong impression of our way of life, our government, our country, our legacy, and our meaning to the rest of the world - it's that big. This movie is meant to be entertaining, get you up to speed, and open your eyes - with an accomplished filmmaker and an all-star cast, this is easily and adeptly done. Where I live conservatives, Republicans, and Christians still dismiss this movie out of hand - so surprisingly you may find yourself cast as a rebel just for watching it, and will find them completely unfamiliar with any of the facts of the case, and unaware of the glaring inadequacies of the Warren Report. Be informed. Get entertained. It's not the truth - but it will get you asking the right questions - one's we've never been the answers to - and that we are entitled to.",1385856000,2,1930,4.2904109589041095

 I watched this when it came out, but now after reading tens of thousands of pages of related history, I appreciate it much more deeply than I did at first viewing.  Garrison's contention that the forces of ""Fascism"" were essentially those behind this coup ring true to this very day and hold current relevance.  Our military/intelligence/corporate/media masters would prefer we spend our time guessing who will be voted off the island or labeled the latest singing sensation as we pretend ""reality TV"" is actually ""real.""  The time you spend watching JFK will re-ground you in ""reality"" in a way that just might leave you questioning everything you think is ""real.""

This is a dramatization of course, but it is closely linked to the real case and reflects the kind of research, legal and political, that has been driven by this case.

Today, more than ever, we have deceit and corruption in the place of liberty and justice. Anyone who can look at the overwhelming evidence in the case of JFK, RFK, MLK, and Malcolm X, and believe that there was no military industrial complex involvement is either woefully myopic or a pathological liar.

The evidence takes the form of testimony from hundreds of eye witnesses, scientists, doctors and government employees. To view all the various facts of the case as coincidental is the height of self-delusion and simple-mindedness.

This nation was born fighting the powers that be. It is no different in 2013 than in 1991, or 1963, or 1776!

This is an excellent movie that brings into play hundreds of questionable bits of evidence and ties it all together in an exceptionally unbiased manner. Jim Garrison was a true patriot and a hero for truth, liberty and justice.

Oliver Stone has been very true to facts that New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison unearthed to present at trial against Clay Shaw.  On this 50th anniversary of JFK's murder, it is scary that our government has skimmed over real evidence that proves his death was caused by a combination of government agencies and big business interests.

96682,5,0790729733,"This is the film that stirred public opinion enough to result in the creation of the Assassination Records Review Board, which caused millions of JFK-related documents to be declassified in the 1990s. Those documents contained quite a few important revelations about the case, though the mainstream media has seen fit to ignore them. This, of course, is the same mainstream media that attacked Stone's film with a blind fury and savagery not directed at any other motion picture to my knowledge.

JFK is extremely well-made: the directing, editing and cinematography are perfect. It still stands as an example of the incredible power of film-making (critics would say the power of propaganda). Kevin Costner turns in a strong performance, though he doesn't resemble the real-life Jim Garrison. Gary Oldman is simply stunning as Oswald. We don't know what David Ferrie actually sounded like, and he was actually fairly tall, but Joe Pesci steals every scene he's in.

The screenplay is not perfect. Veteran researcher Harold Weisberg attacked the inaccuracies and invented scenes. Assistant D.A. James Alcock actually delivered the closing argument at the trial. There were no strangers in the Book Depository laying down new flooring (it was being done by the warehouse employees). But the overall message is right on target: Oswald was framed, and JFK was killed by powerful forces inside and outside the government who opposed his policies.",1383436800,5,1442,5.265217391304348

I am not convinced by anything I have read or seen that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, nor am I convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed that resulted in a coup d'etat.

While JFK spins a good story, there is nothing of substance to prove that a conspiracy existed. It is based on the story of a politician who, in my opinion, may have been seeking public acclaim to perpetuate his own career. The movie addresses many very questionable events that took place the day of the assassination and in the months and years following. But Oliver Stone fall short of making a conclusive argument. As the movie clearly shows, there are many facts that point to some kind of cover-up. And while the story-line never specifically addresses it, the enormous scale of the alleged conspiracy and the thousands of people that had to be involved makes it somewhat implausible.

(Not to mention -- why would the Warren Commission let off the evil rightists?)  Perhaps these concerns were addressed later in the movie, but I got tired of waiting for something meaty to show up.  And since I've read and seen quite a bit about the assassination, I also doubt it.  I thought the whole thing was a waste of time, and a waste of big talents, including Costner, Spacek, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jack Lemmon, and Tommy Lee Jones.",1379462400,2,767,4.373239436619718

Kevin Costner's dialogue is so spot on predicting the events of political threats. How many influential individuals and families have met their deaths in tragic events such as poisoning, plane crashes, boat explosion, heart attacks, etc. All under mysterious conditions. If you think this is far fetched you might agree with the Warren Commission's verdict of the single shooter. There is a documentary ""Dark Legacy"" that seems to fill in all the blanks and support the JFK film. I think the historical subterfuge of  killing kings and royal families as well as political foes makes JFK's assassination (as well as his brother, Robert, and Martin Luther King) so much more believable.

96760,5,0790729733,"This is a sad, but professionally excellent movie, based on Jim Garrison's ""On the trail of the Assassins."" Camelot fell because Fascist forces at work shortly after WWII, culminated their dastardly deed right before the nation, while most of us were too busy re-claiming our lives, after having served our country in WWII.
The Warren Commission ignored credible evidence and kept the most revealing facts from the eyes of the public, such as the Zapruder film presented; ignored eye witness reports and many other facets of evidence.  The fact that the man JFK fired from the CIA sat on the Warren Commission should tell you volumns.  Much evidence has already been stolen, like JFK's brain! That would tell you JFK was also shot from the front.  All of our intelligence apparatus was compromised at the very highest levels; even the parade route was changed to accommodate the shooters.  The most glaring omission was the fact that District Attorney Jim Garrison revealed that Ozwald did not fire any shots in the preceding 24 hour period in which JFK and Dallas police officer Trippet were murdered; even the CIA did not have a conclusive report to counter this fact, even though Oswald was, like Ruby, his assassin, an employee of the CIA/FBI.  Noted Historians and Librarians were threatened by a claimed CIA official when all the evidence was revealed to them at the National Archives.  Why are we waiting until we're all dead to have all the evidence finally revealed?  Our Intelligence community's motives and actions will be revealed in 2029, if ever.  Oliver Stone deserves a medal for bringing this accurate historical movie to our attention; even though the reviews to the movie, JFK, show a strong bias to the CIA, FBI, etc. point of view.  So assume Oswald killed JFK & Trippet; they are all dead; why not bring forth all evidence (left), instead of waiting until everyone is dead, who were alive at that time? Read Joan Mellen's book, ""A Farewell to Justice, Jim Garrison, JFK's assassination and the case that should have changed history."" Also, read Jim Garrison's book, ""On the Trail of the Assassins.""

96766,5,0790729733,"After 20+ years, this Oliver Stone tour-de-force holds up remarkably well. One reason is that we haven't been subjected to Kevin Costner overload in recent years, so he's halfway believable as Jim Garrison. Another reason is that the film was already retro-styled two decades in the past when it was being made, so we don't get 1990 continually punching us in the forehead (""Look at those cellphones! Look at those shoulder pads!""). Gary Oldman as Oswald is as stunning as ever. Joe Pesci is miscast as David Ferrie, but he fills the role with gusto. Tommy Lee Jones is hilarious as Clay Shaw.

Oliver Stone took a lot of abuse from the Single Bullet cult when this film came out, but time has killed off the more notable culprits (eg Arlen Specter), and mellowed public opinion on the subject of the Grassy Knoll. Basically, you can now entertain all sorts of alternative theories about the JFK assassination without being thought a Conspiracy Theorist. And public tolerance of the more 'verboten' shadings has broadened. In the early 90s, Oliver Stone couldn't go out on a limb and suggest that LBJ was likely involved in both the assassination and the coverup, but nowadays Roger Stone can put that into a bestseller and find that a half-dozen other recent books have said much the same thing.",1375660800,2,1296,4.811659192825112

But the content, the MESSAGE of this film is atrocious. I understand that most people reading this review are already convinced there was a conspiracy to kill JFK, and I can't change that. But maybe I can convince one or two people.

Stone isn't conducting an investigation, and he's not going for accuracy. He's making as dramatic and exciting a motion picture as he can, to sell more tickets and generate the maximum amount of publicity for the film. That was his entire intent.

Since the movie came out there have been so many detailed examinations of the physical and photographic evidence of the assassination, this movie is almost completely obsolete even for those who disbelieve the Warren Commission's ""lone gunman"" explanation. For instance, the movie's discussion of the ""magic bullet"" (with two large adults sitting in straight-backed chairs on a flat courtroom floor) doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to how Kennedy and Connolly were actually seated in the limousine when the shot was fired. Once you factor in the exact 3-dimensional positions of the men, the ""magic bullet"" theory isn't magic anymore, it's just the simplest explanation that fits all the evidence.

This whole movie is full of things like that. It's exciting and compelling film, yes. But it's nowhere close to TRUTH.",1375228800,13,1440,5.01255230125523

This was the turning point in our nation, when the true powers-that-be decided to exert their control over us.

96798,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone's Guide to All Things Conspiritorial grabs the viewer by the throat from the very first image and shakes you like a pit bull to very end.  It's a fast-moving, compelling plunge through the darkest underbelly of American life and shadow politics.

Not a word of it makes much sense.

But it's a great introduction to what has had conspiracy theorists in a mad huff for the past half century.  It touches in an almost encyclopedic way on the unresolved issues regarding the death of John F. Kennedy (which is, pretty much, everything--even where it occurred.  Dallas is, in effect, trying to pretend ""It didn't happen here"" in the official ceremonies the city is unhappily planning for the 50th anniversary this November).

Don't take Stone's word for it--go dig into the facts for yourself, which is definitely what this polemic will stimulate thoughtful viewers to do.

As filmmaking, I hope editors Hutshing and Scalia, who won an Oscar, were paid overtime.  Friends tell me the swirling camera movements in BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD made them nauseous.  But the strobe-like, relentless cutting in JFK could induce an epileptic fit.  To keep this dry, expository, and dated subject fresh and alive, Stone edits the picture like a man on speed.  Some images move so fast that they are virtually subliminal.

Does the razzle-dazzle serve a purpose?  Or is it just sleight-of-hand to keep the viewer off-base and unlikely to detect some of the inconsistencies in the barrage of information the screenplay hurls at the audience?  The viewer will have to decide.  There is little time for sober reflection while experiencing this movie.  Just hang on for the roller coaster ride, and try to figure it all out later.  Mr. Stone has assigned the viewer some major homework:  not only figure out the assassination mess, but figure out this movie.

As drama, perhaps what works least well are the scenes depicting New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's personal life.  The story casts Garrison as Everyman, encouraging the viewer to share his growing realization that the official version of JFK's death as the work of a lone assassin is bogus.  For us to identify with him, Stone wants us to see Garrison as a regular guy with a loving wife and family (whom he proceeds to ignore as he is drawn deeper into the case). But Garrison, the only person who has ever prosecuted anyone for the murder of the 35th President of the United States, was anything but ordinary.  He was eccentric and obessesed, and in the end, spectacularly unsuccessful in his quest to convict New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw of heading a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.  History has largely dismissed Garrison and his quixotic quest as lunatic.  Stone's attempt to sanitize Garrison into a bland family man and turn him into a national hero simply lacks interest in contrast to the headlong rush of vital importance given to the detective aspects of the story.  The domestic stuff gives the viewer some breathing room, but seems lifeless and dramatically imbalanced by comparison.

JFK is nearly unavoidable for anyone who is interested in the assassination, regardless of whoever the viewer thinks did it.  Thus, Stone is probably due kudos--albeit reluctantly--for reframing and revitalizing the debate with his film made 28 years after that tragic day in Dallas.",1374192000,2,3349,4.987387387387387

If Oliver Stone got a fraction of his facts right, he still did a much better job than any Government sponsored initiative ever did to shed some light on one of the most shameful episodes of American History.

Aside from that, it is a beautifully shot movie, well written, well acted (Kevin Costner at its best!) and well produced. It deserved a lot more Oscars than it actually won (and that it probably didn't win for being so controversial and defiant to the official BS about JFK's killing).",1373500800,3,1003,4.731428571428571

96818,5,0790729733,"This is a film that sparked a lot of controversy, even before it was released. The topic of the film has been (and will likely continue to be) one of the most controversial topics in American history. Unfortunately, the lines of who will like and dislike this movie will fall squarely within whether that person believes there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy or not. I honestly think regardless of where you stand on that subject, this movie is entertaining and worth watching.

Stone definitely believes there was a conspiracy, even while acknowledging in the notes included in the book portion of the director's cut of the film that it is possible there was none. Where he opened himself up to criticism is that he did not pick a theory and go with that. While the movie is centered around the alleged involvement of Clay Shaw, Stone basically threw out all the various possibilities that have been put forth over the years from Cuba to the mob, to the CIA orchestrating the hit. He couches the various theories using words like possibly, maybe etc. He also does a great job weaving in old news and archived footage with scenes that he filmed.  So much so that it was hard to tell at times where the footage ended and the movie started. Stone's stated intention however was to provide all of the theories, and let the viewers make up their own minds. To that end, regardless of whether you believe that was the responsible way to approach the film, it succeeds. Where he did leave himself open to the most valid criticism was where he was just plain inaccurate. The big one that comes to mind is the trial scene recreating the magic bullet when he placed Kennedy and Connely directly in line with each other on the same level. In reality Connely's seat sat lower and off center, which when taken into account omits all the turns that the bullet would have to do in the whole ""left, then right"" sequence of the film.

The lynchpin of the film's quality, regardless of whether you agree with the substance, was the acting. Many A or B list actors who were alive at the time had a role in the film. Some little more than cameos, but it really was a who's who when it came to the cast. I think Costner did a great job making Jim Garrison much more of a heroic figure than he really was. His overall reputation outside the JFK case was pretty checkered. The film boasts a cast of Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Walter Mathau, John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon, among many others. There was not one bad performance in the bunch.

I am not sure how long the theatrical version of the movie is. If memory serves, it was just under three hours. This clocks in at just under three and a half hours, with a lot of additional and extended scenes. Including a 5 minute or so narrative at the beginning of the movie that describes Kennedy's presidency up to that point. There are also a few features included as extras along with even more deleted scenes. Chances are anyone reading this by now already has a strong opinion of the movie. For those who do not, as I said regardless of your position on whether there was a conspiracy or not, you can still enjoy the acting and the non fictionalized or theorized historical aspects of the movie.

96855,5,0790729733,"""JFK"" (1991) uses long monologues to keep the audience riveted.....the Oliver Stone and Co. screenplay is the star of a great show! Here's why......

--------------------

If a Nobel Prize for movie screenplays resulting in incredible movie results were awarded, the writers of the ""JFK"" (1991) screenplay should get the first one..........

Here are the official screenplay credits for ""JFK (1991) starring Kevin Costner: Oliver Stone (screenplay) Zachary Sklar (screenplay) based on the Jim Garrison book ""On the Trail of the Assassins"" and the Jim Marrs book ""Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy"" Two screen writers who used two books to fashion a truly hypnotic screenplay resulting in a wonderful, satisfying, riveting movie.

""There are no good movies without good screenplays"" saith the movie god sage, and this often repeated in ""How To Write Good Screenplays"" type books, of which there are many (many worth reading).

How true! The current (2013) fashion and mania and center stage status of comic book, superhero ""action"" movies packed with special effects and computer generated images (CGI's!) is all about the LACK of good screen writing available to the movie industry, which serves a huge and profitable market (aka the world wide audience reading and willing to pay big money for the distraction from their awful lives provided by a good, entertaining movie), and substitutes video game type psychedelica (both visual and audio images and sounds) to dazzle without the need for mental logic or coherent ideas.

Well......good screenplays are hard to come by, always were.

The ""JFK"" (1991) screenplay resulted in a wonderful, magnetic, riveting movie packed with long, long, long compelling monologues delivered by wonderful, verbally capable actors (Kevin Costner, Donald Sutherland, others) which ""action heroes"" of fame and note (e.g. Clint Eastwood, bless him) could never have, and will never deliver.

Clint, even in his 80's, can jump out of windows and slug bad guys, but he can't provide articulate, sustained intelligent long, long monologues filled with polysyllabic words and complex but logical ideas which go on and and on and on..and keep us all on the edge of our seats, and make us grateful we were lucky enough to see a great movie with almost NO ""action"" and visual crutches the ""no ideas"" ""silent super hero"" movies based on Marvel Comics types shove at us in current times (2013).

Only well educated and articulate actors can ""talk the talk"" and present long, intelligent arguments, and ""JFK"" (1991) does that well, to it's credit.

For those who don't know, ""JFK"" (1991) is a Kennedy assassination conspiracy movie based on Jim Garrison's assertions, legal actions, and book with help from yet another Kennedy assassination conspiracy book..

What the brilliant Oliver Stone and his co-authors have done is simple and wonderful.

They have taken a ""single issue"" argument and ""cause"" well known to the public and famous everywhere, and made a movie consisting of long, long monologues presenting in logical and articulate detail various related arguments in such zealous detail, any lawyer advocate of ability would be dazzled.

And dazzled we, the audience, are....by this movie and it's simple device......logical long monologues presented by well equipped (for monologues) actors which are implicitly dramatic and appealing.

""Single issue"" causes (such as the Kennedy assassination conspiracy arguments) are dramatic and satisfying.

They provide the audience with a good time for the same reason a good football game provides good times to onlookers.

Logic, oddly, has very little to do with it all.

""Single issue"" causes not seriously challenged or contradicted (the case in ""JFK"" 1991) SEEM logical and deliver a delicious satisfaction to the audience.

This has nothing to do with whether or not the ""cause"" presented is worthy or whether the conclusions advocated are accurate and true.

It's all about the psychological satisfaction of hearing a good one sided case well presented which we've all heard about before, and can never know about completely....nobody can for most famous ""single issue"" causes of fame.

And there are many, many, MANY ""single issue causes"" of fame over history which could ALSO be presented in movie form using the techniques of screen writing used in ""JFK"" (1991), which would make incredibly successful and satisfying movies (again, let us emphasize that logic has little to do with emotional and mental satisfaction...a good ""single issue"" movie filled with monologues must avoid on-screen challenges to the case it presents....the fact it's one sided is what will make it a successful movie!

Richard Hofstader's brilliant book titled ""The Paranoid Style In American Politics"" (1952 Harvard U. Press) discusses the fame and success of single issue causes (and books supporting the causes which became best sellers) in a book chapter about William Hope Harvey's ""Coin's Financial School"" (1890's) book advocating ""Free Silver"" and bi-bimetallism....big single issue cause in the 1890s....William Jennings Bryan based his USA Presidential 1896 campaign on it).

Hofstadter also mentions other 19th century ""single cause"" books of fame in passing, including Maria Monk's 1836 ""Awful Disclosures Of The Hotel Dieu Nunnery Of Montreal"" anti-Catholic book, and ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" anti-Negro slavery book, both widely popular ""single cause"" advocacy books of huge fame and profit for book publishers.

Hofstadter states, rightly, that single cause writing (which the ""JFK"" 1991 screenplay definitely is) is successful due to ""the fierce logic of the one-idea mind, the firm conviction that complex social issues can be unraveled to the last point, that social problems can really be solved, and solved by simple means."" The back up materials which can feed a movie screenplay of the ""JFK"" (1991) type are copious and available almost in tidal wave proportions.

So much has been written (much of it well written in clear, skilled, logical, easy to understand, plausible, logical prose) to support the various single issue causes scattered over history (from the lost continent of Atlantis to the Yellow Peril scare of the 19th and 20th centuries!), creating an Oliver Stone/ Zachary Sklar/ Jim Garrison type screenplay, and getting the same good results (and good movie) the ""JFK"" (1991) screenplay got would be easy.

What is Hollywood waiting for? It's time for more ""single issue causes"" movies with many long, long monologues delivered by good actors......

The movie makers will get rich, and the lucky audiences will be endlessly satisfied!.",1368403200,,6629,5.337811900191938

In the early part of the film the colors are muted and the images don't seem to be as sharp as they should be, for a Blu-ray presentation.  However, by listening to the commentary, I found out decisions regarding the visual images were intentional.  I suppose because the time of the assassination was chaotic and confusing period, the decision was made for the visual aspect of the film to reflect that confusion.  As the film progresses, the visual changes, and becomes clearer along with the story.
This release has a few special features, at least some of them were also included on previous releases.  The first extra is a full length audio commentary by Oliver Stone (205 minutes).  Next is the documentary Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy.  Then there are several deleted/extended scenes, including an alternative ending.  Multi-media essays are included.  Finally the theatrical trailer.  The movie is great, the extra features are fine, but the reason I gave this Blu-ray disc only 4 stars is the special features portion of the pop-up menu.  I HATE IT.  All of the special features are in white type with a red background, so as I arrow up or down, the whiteness turns ever so slightly brighter.  The problem is that I can not see the change in the whiteness.  I have to assume the 'highlighted' area is the top item, then count down as I hit the arrow button and hope I've selected what I want.  The problem is that I am often wrong.  It's very frustrating.

96872,1,0790729733,"This film raised considerable controversy when it was first released in 1991, with good reason. Oliver Stone largely based ""JFK"" on New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's book ""On the trail of the Assassins"", although Stone essentially attempts to gather together every conspiracy theory espoused since Kennedy was shot in Dealey Plaza.
The most objectionable aspects of this film are Stone's depictions of Garrison as a fearless seeker of truth, & New Orleans resident Clay Shaw (who Garrison charged with conspiring with Lee Harvey Oswald to assassinate Kennedy) as a sinister, malevolent villain.
In reality, Garrison was a paranoid, irrational bully who persecuted an entirely innocent man in Shaw.
As is depicted in ""JFK"", the jury in the Clay Shaw case threw out Garrison's charges against Shaw. What isn't shown is the ongoing persecution of Shaw by Garrison after that case collapsed. Garrison almost immediately charged Shaw with perjury, alleging that during the trial Shaw had lied under oath in denying having ever met Lee Harvey Oswald or alleged co-conspirator David Ferrie. Garrison did this despite his knowledge that the testimony of his star-witness (Perry Russo) was at very least suspect, or more likely totally false.

Following the perjury charge Clay Shaw sought the protection of a Federal Court, asking for an injunction against Garrison proceeding with the perjury charges, or any other charges related to the Kennedy assassination. For those such as Oliver Stone who regard Garrison as some sort of hero, here are some of the comments that the Federal court judge made when granting Shaw an injunction against Garrison's attempts to further prosecute him:
""To characterize the facts (of Garrsion's prosecution of Shaw) as unique & bizarre is no exaggeration""...""Shaw was first interviewed (by Garrion's office) in December 1996...Garrison testified that at that time Shaw was not considered a suspect & was not advised of his constitutional rights, nor was he told of his right to counsel...just how Shaw was first selected to be interviewed (by Garrison) when he was not a suspect is another unanswered question in this case...(Garrison) offered no evidence to show any basis for his office's interrogation of Shaw concerning such a shocking crime...(Garrison's) failure to offer any explanation leaves this court with but one conclusion, that there was no factual basis for questioning Shaw regarding the assassination""
The Federal Court judge went on to dismiss Perry Russo as a credible witness & noted Garrison's office's use of hypnotism & Sodium Pentathol injections to induce testimony from Russo favourable to the prosecution. The Court stated ""substantial doubts are raised regarding the validity & objectivity of a state's case when the state resorts to such extra-ordinary tactics as were employed by Garrison on Russo"". The Court noted that prior to Shaw even being charged Garrison had been advised by 1 of the police officers involved in the investigation that Russo had himself expressed doubts as to the veracity of his evidence.
The Federal Court noted that by the stage of the perjury trial Russo was refusing to testify any further against Shaw, & the Court concluded ""all these actions with the subsequent doubtfulness of Russo as a witness show clearly that Garrison did not act in good faith regarding Russo's story..Garrison was aware of Russo's unreliability, yet he charged & prosecuted Shaw once, & now has again charged him for an offence stemming from Russo's story...Garrison's use of Russo is but one of several factors that reveal his mala fides (bad faith) in this case""
Despite the Federal Court's scathing comments & Perry Russo's refusal to provide any futher testimony against Shaw, Garrison unbelievably appealed to the Supreme Court, resulting in Clay Shaw's financial ruination via the legal costs incurred in defending himself against Garrison's relentless persecution. Ultimately, sanity prevailed & the Supreme Court upheld the Federal's Court's injunction against Garrison. Tragically, Clay Shaw died penniless, before he could complete his action for damages against Garrison.
Oliver Stone should hang his head in shame at his portrayal of Clay Shaw as an evil conspirator, rather than the persecuted victim of Garrison's lack of integrity & malevolent abuse of power & process.
There is one final point to be made in relation to Stone's defamatory portayal of Clay Shaw. The key scenes in ""JFK"" are those that attempt to depict Oswald as an innocent ""patsy"" caught up in a conspiracy by nameless conspirators to frame him. This begs the question - if Oswald was innocent of involvement in Kennedy's assassination, how on earth would Shaw be guilty of any crime - it wouldn't have mattered how many times Shaw did or didn't meet Oswald. Despite this obvious contradiction, Stone insists on depicting Shaw as a glowering, sinister caricature of villainy.

96874,1,0790729733,"Please know that Stone has perpetrated one of the biggest frauds in movie history (which is saying a lot).  While he admits he took creative license, this film glosses over the following FACTS and replaces them with Stone's politically correct conspiracy babble.  I will list several... there are several hundred if one cares to think and read.

Far from the hero do-gooder that Jim Garrison is portrayed as (and that Kevin Costner so often plays), Jim Garrison was a sleazy DA who had NO case or evidence and fabricated one by putting the muscle on a few people to lie for him.  Why... to grab his moment of fame in an otherwise very forgettable career.

He targeted and destroyed the reputation and life of Clay Shaw.  Shaw was a private, successful, gay man who did a lot for charities in New Orleans.  He had as much to do with JFK as your do or I do.  Garrison felt no qualms about ruining this man's life and impoverishing him (legal bills) just to grab headlines that were later proven to be baseless.  Garrison is magically transformed into Stone's hero and mouthpiece for distorting the mountain of evidence against Oswald and only Oswald.

Oswald was a wife-beating, ex-marine marksman (the shot he made were easy with a rifle and a magnifying scope and a target moving slowing away from him).  The only reason he coincidentally worked at the Texas School Book Depository was that a friend of his wife felt sorry for her since Oswald was consistently unable to hold a job and she knew the TSBP was hiring.  He got the job weeks or months before Kennedy first thought of going to Dallas, therefore Oswald being set up with his sniper nest was coincidence.  Oswald also attempted the assassination of a right-wing Dallas politician by firing the same gun into the man's window (bullet deflecting off the window pane wood, thus the man was not hit).  Oswald hated the USA where he was a failure and a loner, so he tried the USSR and quickly wore out his welcome as the Soviets quickly realized he was mentally unstable, had no info they needed, and was totally unsuited to work for an organization such as the KGB.  Oswald left the USSR (they were happy to see him leave) and then he returned to the USA expecting much fanfare about his importance... there was little/none (sadly our CIA and FBI should have known this nut with a gun was on the parade route in Dallas).  He also tried to move to Cuba but was refused by the Cubans.  On the day he killed Kennedy he drove to work with a coworker carrying a very long, thin package that he said was ""curtain rods""... this was the murder weapon.  His finger and palm prints were on the rifle. The bullets match his (including the non-magical one that went through Kennedy's neck into Governor Connolly).  After killing Kennedy he left the building, took a bus, walked to his house, changed clothes, grabbed a handgun he owned, walked out and when confronted killed a police officer in front of eye witnesses, then tried to hide in a movie theatre despite several witnesses following his movements and was caught and interrogated.... now if some evil conspiracists were behind Oswald, why didn't they kill him to shut him up immediately when they had all these chances???

I'll stop.  Nobody can know 100% of everything about this case.  Perhaps I am wrong and there was some conspiracy... but I currently have no reasonable doubt that Oswald acted alone.  I encourage anyone to read the Warren Commission Report, some conspiracy books, and also Gerald Posner's ""Case Closed.""  I read all these, originally thinking there had to be a conspiracy.  I just know with 100% certainty that the movie JFK is packed with lies that Oliver Stone justifies as creative license.  He is a Houdini in that he has so many people fooled.  Sadly, Stone's props are not magic boxes and chains, they are the history of a beloved president, and the damage he has done to the truth is shameful, just as shameful as the actions of his ""hero"" Jim Garrison.

I am not a Kevin Costner fan in general, but I do enjoy his performance in this flick! And what a star-studded supporting cast! Some of the the stars' roles are pretty minor but still add to the greatness and validity of this historical film. Yes, it's a long movie, but if you're a 20th century history buff fascinated by the whole story of the Kennedy assassination investigation like I am, you will not be bored for a second throughout this film!

Also, last night I watched this DVD on my Blu-Ray player and 42"" HDTV. Even though the DVD is technically standard definition (I bought it two years ago, long before my HDTV), I was amazed at how sharp the picture is...it looked like HD to me! Just a great picture, quality-wise.

The 2-disc edition features a very long featurette that details the whole story of the investigation with various interviews, footage and commentary from people who were there.

96919,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone described this movie as a ""counter-myth"" to the Warren Commission Report. That was an artful way of admitting that his film is a work of fiction.

For example, he portrays Garrison's version of the point in the Clay Shaw trial where New Orleans Police officer Aloysius Habighorst is to be called as a witness who will testify that Shaw, while being booked, admitted to using the alias Clay Bertrand: ""But before Habighorst could take the stand, Judge Haggerty suddenly ordered the jury removed from the court."" Like everything else in the movie, the dramatic effectiveness is terrific.

However, it's simply not true. It was Garrison's own second chair, Assistant DA James Alcock, who asked for the jury to be removed: ""Your Honor, before calling the State's next witness, I might announce to the Court that the matter we are now going into, by law is required to be gone into outside the presence of the Jury, so at this time I would ask the Court to excuse the Jury so that we might enter this area in accordance with the law."" There's no controversy about this. The trial transcript is public record and available online.

Dramatic license, you might say. Like the composite characters. Or the fact that Garrison did not meet Fletcher Prouty - the ""X"" so brilliantly portrayed by Donald Sutherland - until long after the Shaw trial.

But the film's insinuations come in such a rapid-fire onslaught that they overwhelm one's critical faculties. X says, ""We had a third of a combat division returning from Germany in the air above the United States at the time of the shooting, and at 12:34 PM, the entire telephone system went dead in Washington for a solid hour, and on the plane back to Washington, word was radioed from the White House Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson that one individual performed the assassination.""

In fact, the phone outages were uneven and occurred in several major cities - as one would expect in the wake of such a cataclysmic news story. [Search for ""sinister phone outage"" for details.] I'm sure many of you tried and failed to telephone people in New York City on 9/11. And I don't believe even 9/11 truthers attribute that to a government conspiracy. However, the ""JFK"" viewer has no time to process any of this.

Now I am not condemning the movie for this. On the contrary, it's what makes it such a riveting viewing experience. [The few dull scenes - most of which are the boilerplate domestic stuff with Sissy Spacek - come almost as a relief from the surrounding three hours of tension and paranoia.] But the result is as propagandistic as anything put forward by Warren Commission defenders like Gerald Posner or Vincent Bugliosi.

I don't believe Kennedy was the peacenik Stone hero-worships him as. So I don't believe his central theory that Kennedy was killed as a threat to the military-industrial establishment. I also don't believe that a commission comprised of the ilk of Gerald Ford and Arlen Specter deserves the least benefit of the doubt. So the questions remain - and probably always will. Just don't let the dazzling film artistry of Oliver Stone fool you into thinking he has the answers.",1357171200,2,3155,4.7992633517495396
96930,5,0790729733,"I enjoy many of Oliver Stone's flicks.  He holds out possibilities to ponder.  I was in grade school when Kennedy was shot, I love historical movies, so I am a little bias on this movie.  The main character, Jim Garrison (played by Costner), is in this movie as a supreme court judge.  A bit dramatic, which is Costner's style of movie, but I liked the premise, question authority and our government.",1357171200,,400,4.591549295774648
96931,3,0790729733,"Oliver Stone might have chosen to present this film as a kind of imagined or alternative history, a historical fantasy or speculation making no claim to being historical truth. He chose instead to ""write history with lightning,"" as Woodrow Wilson is reported to have said about D.W. Griffith's admiring portrait of the origins of the Ku Klux Klan, ""Birth of a Nation."" In doing so, he became perhaps the most important American historian of the Kennedy assassination--""most important"" in the sense of having the greatest influence on the public's view of that tragic event. The film's claim (which Stone has defended ever since it was first released) to be presenting the historical truth is very clear, although when criticized for his many demonstrable falsehoods and distortions, Stone sometimes retreated to saying that he was entitled to ""poetic license"", to ""taking some liberties with minor details"" in order to convey a larger and more important truth, that all history was myth and that all he had done was offer ""a counter-myth to the myth presented by the Warren Commission."" Like most viewers, I have no doubt that Stone passionately believed in the truth of what he was depicting: the theories about the assassination put forward by Jim Garrison (a District Attorney in New Orleans), Fletcher Prouty (at one time an official at the Pentagon) and Jim Marrs (author of ""Crossfire"").

A complete listing of Stone's distortions, omissions, factual errors, and presentations of speculation as fact would amount to a book rather than a review; these went far beyond ""taking some liberties with minor details.""  Here are two examples. The first is the character named ""Willie O'Keefe,"" the imprisoned homosexual prostitute played by Kevin Bacon. This is a completely invented character who fills what would otherwise be a very important void in the story (I was about to say ""plot""). He is the only witness to a meeting that is supposed to have taken place between Lee Harvey Oswald, Clay Shaw (the New Orleans businessman prosecuted by Garrison for conspiracy in the death of Kennedy), and one David Ferrie. The person who actually offered this supposed information to Garrison was an insurance salesman named Perry Russo, but Stone here faced a difficulty: by the time he made the movie, Russo had long been completely discredited and had repudiated his own earlier testimony. So Stone invented a character who could be presented as the source of Garrison's supposed information, but who, being completely imaginary, would not leave Stone open to the charge that he had knowingly presented false testimony as fact.

The second is the meeting depicted between Garrison and ""X"", the ""black operations specialist"" played by Donald Sutherland. This is a crucially important scene, as it provides Garrison with the Washington background that makes sense of the mysteries he has begun to unravel in New Orleans. ""X"" tells him that he is ""close, closer than you think"" to revealing the truth about the conspiracy, and urges him to bring prosecutions, any prosecutions, that will enable him to work upwards towards the more important conspirators. The trouble is that Stone has admitted that in actuality (you know, that stuff that's otherwise indistinguishable from myth), the real Garrison never had any such meeting with any such person.

Viewing ""JFK"" again after more than two decades, I'm struck by the extent to which it is so completely a product of the Cold War. The picture of American politics that it offers is that found in the crudest Soviet propaganda of the Cold War era; in the climactic courtroom scene Garrison/Costner even utters that propaganda's ultimate magic word, ""fascism."" What happens if an American president undertakes, or even intends, policies that threaten the military's desire for war and the desire of big business for war profits? Simple: they have him murdered by their tools and allies, replace him with a president who promises to do what they want, and then organize a second plot, a vast coverup of the original plot. Kennedy was assassinated by ""American ruling circles which seek to harm the cause of peace,"" as the Soviets used to put it. But to adopt the view of one's country put forward by its Cold War adversary is to stay very much inside the outlook formed in and by the Cold War.

 Stone's adoption of this stance is closely related to what seems to be his other guiding historical principle: ""Whatever the Warren Commission said about the assassination, the exact opposite must be the truth."" This is just a more explicit version of Stone's own formulation that ""JFK"" was a ""counter-myth"" to the Warren commission's ""myth."" Since the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald shot Kennedy and that it could find no evidence that he was part of any larger conspiracy, it must be the case that Oswald did not shoot Kennedy, and that evidence of a conspiracy was overwhelming. It can be very tempting to think that truth must lie in inverting or reversing a once-dominant view, but it's a temptation that ought to be resisted.

The difficulty with this ""the exact opposite of what was previously believed must be true"" approach is that it remains within the framework of ""what was previously believed."" As Garrison says in ""JFK"": white is black, and black is white--what stays the same in this change of outlook is the belief that things are either black or white. So, to take a crucial political premise of the film: in the United States, is the military in the last analysis under the control of civilian elected officials? No; if the highest civilian authority acts against the interests of the military, the military institutes a murderous coup d'etat. But replacing a high-school civics dream of American democracy with a high-school civics nightmare of vast hidden tyranny is not the same thing as replacing falsehood with truth. It's a view that remains at the intellectual and emotional level of high-school civics.

Though made with great skill, and rightly praised as pure entertainment even by many who regard its history as a mix of lies and lunacy, ""JFK"" is in some ways not an outstandingly good movie, even on its own terms. The depiction of Garrison's marital troubles--he cares so much about finding the truth that he neglects his family!--is trite and corny; not even Sissy Spacek can make these ancient cinematic cliches anything other than a narrative-killing bore. Garrison's climactic oration to the jury is intolerably long-winded and self-righteous, and wouldn't lead any jury to convict anyone of anything. And some of the key story lines are  incoherent. Take the presentation of Lee Harvey Oswald. He is recruited by ""American intelligence"" (as a teenage Marine?) to go on a special mission to the USSR, posing as a defector. There, he somehow links up with the Soviet KGB (huh?), and provides them with the information they need to shoot down the U-2 spy plane, which at that point (1960) was the CIA's single greatest intelligence asset. (Why would American intelligence do this? To wreck a Soviet-American summit conference that might have eased international tensions!) On his return to the US, he pretends to be pro-Castro, which puts him in a position to join in plots with anti-Castro Cubans (say what?). Then, he turns into a complete zero, a pawn, ""a patsy"" (as he called himself), someone so silent and little-noticed that he seems barely a human being at all. Certainly, for an alleged master spy, he has remarkably little suspicion that somebody might be setting him up for something. Stone's rather far-fetched idealization of Kennedy (supposedly, he would have gotten us out of Vietnam, disbanded the CIA, ended the Cold War--all the best hopes of America and the world died with Camelot!) produces a treatment that in effect strips Oswald of whatever humanity, whatever power of human agency, he had. Impossible to think that an icon of liberalism could have been murdered by a man who from his early teens understood himself to be, and proclaimed himself to be, a leftist radical! Rather, this terrible deed must have been ordered by America's hidden rulers, who for some reason recruited a bunch of New Orleans lowlifes to carry it out-- but these in turn had to work together with CIA and Pentagon ""black ops"" experts (couldn't the murderous military-industrial complex have relied entirely on its own highly trained killers?). Then the innocent Oswald is framed as a lone rifleman firing from a single location--framed for the work of no less than three separate teams of shooters, all firing from different places!? Does any of this make any more sense than the silliest Bond or Bourne movie?

The three stars are for the purely cinematic skill with which ""JFK"" was made, because of its great influence on American public opinion, and because it's worth seeing for its unforgettable demonstration that movie-making talent on the one hand, and an interest in grasping and presenting historical truth on the other, have absolutely no necessary connection with each other. As history, ""JFK"" is beneath rating.",1357084800,16,9101,5.033178500331785

96959,5,0790729733,"A person would have to be extremely gullible after seeing JFK to ever accept that Oswald acted alone. Just have some serious questions is all I ask of pundits, because in my mind after reading a 108 books on the Assassination, that whatever LHO did on nov. 22 1963, whether he was on the 6th floor shooting at JFK, or shooting at Connally, or being a decoy either shooting a couple shots into the grass divider, or sticking a rifle out the window, or being on the 2nd floor getting lunch or a coke, there is no chance whatsoever he did this on his own. Imagine if your own father was killed under mysterious circumstances, maybe a city councilman say in a legal dispute, and was shot to death. You were then told by the coroner that it was an open and shut case. that there was an investigative panel, and both the back wound and the head wound were raised 4 inches from the original Autopsy, FBI and medical reports, would you just accept the official verdict with no questions? Well that's the unbelievable nonsense that you must accept in JFK's death. Also remember that Dr. Burkley, JFK's doctor thru his atty. in 1977 to the HSCA said that"" others besides Oswald must have participated"". There is no record of any follow up - imagine that, he didn;t say maybe, he said must, and was the only physician to see JFK at both Parkland and Bethesda Naval Hospitals. Burkley, a full Admiral was not called to testify before the Warren Commission. If some one at least reads a couple of the following books they will be informed-A Farewell To Justice Joan Mellen-Last Investigation-Gaeton Fonzi-Man Who Knew Too Much Dick Russell-JFK And The Unspeakable James Douglass-LBJ Mastermind Of The JFK Assassination Phillip Nelson. Important thing is as it says in JFK"" DON'T LET ANYBODY DO YOUR THINKING FOR YOU"".

JFK wasn't my favorite president, but didn't deserve to be murdered in office.  This is the movie of the only trial (except for the 2000? senate investigation) to actually pronounce that this ""theory"" had a basis in fact.

96971,2,0790729733,"Ordered this title for my growing Blu ray collection as I really enjoyed this movie on theatrical release and DVD. Took nearly a month to get to me(I live in New Zealand) but was a couple of weeks earlier than Amazon had estimated so a bonus I guess.
I found this Blu ray version of JFK to be of very average quality picture wise but rather than blame a poor transfer I think it was more to do with Stone wanting to invite the viewer into to an emotional laden storyline than worrying how good this movie would look in 1080p.(Of course Blu ray was not mainstream when this movie was released) but as this version was released in 2011 it perhaps couldve been a chance for Warner Bros to really give this film the once over that I believed it deserves.
The 5.1 Dolby THD soundtrack is also of average quality but better than my DVD version but there seems to be a small technical glitch where the sound and picture appear out of sync in several key scenes of the movie. I have a 2011 Panasonic Blu ray player and a PS3 and it did this on both machines so maybe its due to the fact of a poor soundtrack transfer Im not sure but Im not impressed.
Overall Im glad I have this movie in my collection now(Currently not available for retail in New Zealand at this point of time) however I do believe that this version could've had benefitted so much more from a decent remaster(picture and soundwise)to enhance what is an enjoyable watch and arguably a great movie.",1348272000,,1457,4.34065934065934

Only with Micael Rooker it's, Mississippi Burning, Sea of Love, etc. It really wasn't neccessary to (In this Version) expose The Character of Bill Brousard of being linked to The Conspierancy It Self. I Really Disliked that Airport Scene where Kevin Costner was giving holy hell to Mike Rooker. At least in the original version, Bill seemed to Genuinly be on the same side as Jim Garretson. Bil Brousard was the one who found out that Clay Shaw was Clay Bertrand, wasn't he? Also, it was clear that the FBI was Blackmailing Bill. Remember the scene where Bill is holding the umbrella, and the FBI guy approached him and told him to get in the car? ""Oswald diddn't pull that trigger, Castro Did. But if that comes out, there's going to be a war. Millions of people are going to die"". Remember that line? I also don't believe that sentence in the credits claiming that it was discovered that Bill Brousard was working with the CIA from the get go. In my opinion that was just a bunch of Political Sour Grapes by Oliver Stone. This Movie was based on conjector not facts. And don't ever get me started on that Dick Cavett Movie on Elvis. That was a classic example of ""Diarrhea of the Pen"" Anyway,is there anyone out there in Holliwood, come Christmas Season willing to give Michael Rooker a roll of Santa Clause.

96990,5,0790729733,"Look, I am not a liberal or a conspiracy nut, and yes, Stone's film blurs the lines between fact and fantasy, between speculation and evidence. I have no love for Oliver Stone, and I feel he has a track reccord of playing fast and loose with details to suit a political agenda. I sort of see him as the Howard Zinn of film making; that is not a compliment.

However, with that as a caveat, I think it is also fair to assume that JFK was never intended to be 100 percent factually based. Rather, it was an effort ( and a darn successful one in my view ) to point out how many holes there are in the ""official"" narrative of what supposedly took place that horrible day in Dallas.

Some people say that Walter Cronkite panned this film. So what? I could give a rats you-know-what about his opinion. In fact, if Cronkite didn't like it that tells me we may just be on to something here.

So many questions left unanswered, but here is one issue that truly puzzles me: It is the height of the cold war, JFK is in hostile territory politically speaking (Texas) , and he is riding in an open top limo down streets lined with highrise buildings. Are you kidding me? What, did they WANT him to be shot? Some would say the answer is yes.

I don't know what really happened that day any more than you do. I do, however, recall my dad saying right after the assasination,"" Why the hell did he (JFK) have the top (of the limo) down?"" My dad was a WWII vet with an eighth grade education. If HE was asking that question, you really have to wonder how JFK's security team could have screwed things up that badly by putting the president in such an obviously vulnerable position. Kennedy was a sitting duck, and it is very hard to believe all the professional secret service and law enforcement people assigned to protect him didn't know that all too well. It raises MANY red flags.

great place to start.  This Director's cut (Oliver Stone) gives an overwhelming
amount of information in a logical and coherent narrative. Film covers the attempt
to conduct a trial for someone alleged to be involved in the killing of JFK. Stone
weaves an intruiging narrative based on two books - ""Crossfire"" by Jim Marrs, and
""On the Trail of the Assassins"" by Jim Garrison, who prosecuted the New Orleans
case in court.  He was the DA of New Orleans and took a lot of criticism from the
Federal government, which attempted to discredit him as a egotist out for publicity.",1341705600,,657,4.655172413793103
96992,5,0790729733,"I never watched this movie until this past year because I didn't care anything for Oliver Stone.

I never had an opinion about the Kennedy assassination because even though I know where I was when I heard the news, I wasn't old enough, alert enough and astute enough to recognize that the media rolled over and played stupid just like the authorities told them to do. The truth initially and immediately came out on the news but the authorities gave them a different story and EVERYONE in the media exchanged the facts for the lies they were told to report and unfortunately, even a few years ago, before he died, Peter Jennings was still spouting the same lies even though the truth is now all over the Internet.

This isn't about ""believe what we tell you,"" anymore. There is so much information on the Internet and so many people have done their ""homework,"" and a very thorough job has been done by so many that an amazing amount of information has been compiled, including the scores and scores of murders to cover up the complicity of LBJ, the Warren Commission, the Dallas Police Dept., the FBI, the Secret Service and the CIA. (Notice I only mentioned legal authorities, not the mob -- then they later murdered Robert Kennedy. I haven't investigated, but wouldn't be surprised if the same people were responsible for MLK.)

It's been absolutely devastating. It's no wonder so many people refuse to deal with it, look at it or consider it. What patriotic American wants to think our government is just as wicked as the Soviet Union or any other ""evil empire""? It's hard to take; it's hard to face; it's hard to swallow, but the evidence is absolutely overwhelming. Our government is evil and the news media is complicit even though they pretend to be the watchdog of the public interest. What a lie.

In the investigation I did in only the last two years (simply because I was hearing so much about the assassination that I thought I'd finally start paying attention, previously having no opinion about it), it was heart-wrenching, being a law-abiding citizen who easily choked up or teared up when either the National Anthem or America the Beautiful was played. I thought we really were a great nation.

I'm not a racist and there are good black men for whom I would vote, for president, but I was flabbergasted and appalled when Obama was elected (even though Obama isn't black, but Mulatto, blacks have identified with him for the worst of reasons). It was obvious from the get go that this man was a liar and a fraud and an evil man unqualified to be president, even before I knew anything about his hiding his past.

Yet, who in government or the media has made the deal out of the many issues that expose this man simply isn't qualified to be president and isn't a man of character and honor? The most powerful man in the world has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to hide his past and neither our representatives nor the media care?!?! This is so terribly wrong!

It was after this national travesty, at which I was completely dumbfounded that I started looking at the Kennedy assassination.

Friends, all the evidence is there. The government not only murdered the president but every president since, I'm convinced, knew about it and I think this is what emboldened the Clintons in their many crimes. ""No biggie. We can get away with it."" And they have gotten away with so much -- that is also all over the Internet, but the news media won't tell you and your elected representatives won't tell you either EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW.

Now, Obama, lying through his teeth and claiming he's a Christian, has openly mocked the Bible but his every reference to the qur'an is preceded by the word ""Holy."" He's the first president in history to announce to our enemies that we are not a Christian nation and he's the only president to bow to an islamic leader, and celebrate and honor islamic holidays in the White House while snubbing traditional Christian events.

What's the media's response to this? Are they really our watchdogs? Do we want an islamic America? Doe America understand the consequences of endorsing and embracing a religion that is dedicated to our destruction because we are ""the great satan""? Am I saying something that you haven't heard?

I'm still shaking my head in disbelief. Why did we put an enemy of this country in the White House?

Please note when this started. Prayer in public school and Bible reading in public school were dishonestly and wrongly declared unconstitutional in 1962 and 1963 and Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Do your homework and examine any area you please regarding stability, security, trouble, crime, education, business, accomplishments, science, morals, ethics, etc., in the decades before '63 and the decades afterwards. It's night and day difference.

That you should be scared because of the facts that the news media doesn't want you to see and realize tells me they're the only reason the government has gotten away with destroying this country.

Examine any area you want. We were the world leader in virtually every positive way. Today we're the world leader in MANY evil ways.

If you haven't gotten it by now, JFK tells the truth and the government is STILL LYING ABOUT IT AS IS THE NEWS MEDIA. Most of the people who would be harmed by the truth are dead, but not all of them. But you won't hear a word of truth about it from the news media.

Our enemy is in the White House and both he and his wife hate what this nation *used* to stand for. There never was a time when everything was right about our nation, but now, is there anything right for which our nation stands?

The banks and financial institutions have been shown to be crooked and yet who is being punished? The American taxpayer. Thanks Obama.",1341100800,2,5787,4.685714285714286

Easily the best film of the 1990's, it is also one of the most influential. Directed by Oliver Stone (NATURAL BORN KILLERS, U-TURN, ALEXANDER) and starring Kevin Costner (WATERWORLD, THE POSTMAN, OPEN RANGE) as Jim Garrison, the ONLY public offical to conduct his own investigation into the assassination of the 35th president of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. The film opens with a great scene full of stock footage narrarated by Martin Sheen (WALL STREET) setting up a feel for the 1960's, Kennedy's administration, his dealings with the Soviets, the Cuban missile crisis, the Bay Of Pigs invasion, and the C.I.A.. And then goes in to November 22, 1963 the day of Kennedy's assassination. We see the events taking place as we would have seen them on television that day. New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison watches too. Three years later the subject comes up again to Garrison and he discovers that accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, brilliantly played by Gary Oldman (BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, SID & NANCY, THE DARK KNIGHT) spent the summer before the assassination right in Garrison's own backyard in New Orleans. Jim's investigation begins and takes him through a dark winding forest and right to the doorstep of the Central Intelligence Agency & the Military Industrial Complex. He then arrests a respected New Orleans buisness man and founder of the New Orlean's Trade Mart, Clay Shaw, played by Tommy Lee Jones (THE CLIENT, BATMAN FOREVER, NATURAL BORN KILLERS)for which he recieved an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Supporting Actor"". Garrison brings the only conspirator ever accused to trial for conspiring to murder JFK. The film is brilliant, engaging, thought provoking, stylish, expertly directed, wonderfully written, with top notch acting by an ensemble ALL STAR cast that also includes, Kevin Bacon(STIR OF ECHOES), Joe Pesci(CASINO), Sissy Spacek(CARRIE), Ed Asner(THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW), Jack Lemon(MY FELLOW AMERICANS), Walter Matthau(GRUMPY OLD MEN), John Candy(THE GREAT OUTDOORS), and Donald Sutherland(A TIME TO KILL).

and you aren't likely to ever see another. One of the best films I've ever seen and is a film that every American should see as well. It will entertain and disturb you.

But, then came the 1960's.:  for the first time i saw a beautiful first lady who had dark hair was not white: A young and handsome president with cute small children.  So refreshing to the 20 somethings.
Then came the horrific assasssination of president  kennedy, it was so frightening. I thought,  what will happen to our country now.?  The only thing the american people  knew about the assasination is  what the news reported; most info  never made any sense, the majority of americans knew we were not being told the whole truth, but then the Vietnam war is taking lots of southern/north white and black boys, people protesting vietnam war(that majority of americans did not even understand why we were in vietnam), students being shot at kent state, blacks marching for equality, martin luther assassinated, then bobby kennedy assassinated.  To go from the peaceful 50's to all this death and devastation was mind boggling. (Nothing to say of all the body bags being brought home from Vietnam)
Most americans in 1960's did not trust us gov.  we knew we were told what they wanted us to hear.  Pres.

Oliver Stone has certainly created a piece of art here, something so grand that no matter how many viewings of this great picture, you will most certainly discover an unseen treasure that you missed the last time you watched it. The incredible oscar winning editing and wonderful cinematography of this relic will keep you intrenched into this incredible film the whole way through. The deeper one gets into this film, the stronger and more potent it becomes. Every actor in this film is incredible, reflecting a past reality so well, that at many times one forgets that this is actually a movie. For example, the scenes of the Kennedy autopsy are so dark and disturbing, but at the same time so intriguing that one cannot help but keep such images inside ones memory. Like a great movie JFK is a film that will remain with you always, and a film that keeps you wanting to see it again and keep asking questions about the greatest unsolved murder in our history.",1317859200,,1130,4.599009900990099

I bought this because I wasn't quite satisfied with the picture in the 2-disc DVD set and wanted a better version of this movie.
Although this BD is no match for let's say ""La piscine"" or ""The Dark Knight"" (both Warner) or many of the Pixar releases, I'm happy with this BD. Picture quality may vary (as do film stocks/sources), but in my view the upgrade from DVD to BD was well worth it (as watched on 46"" screen)!

News on the aftermath of JFK`s assassination was very rare and censored here in Australia and that`s why many of us never knew about Shaw`s arrest until this movie came out. This film really shows how we were all lied to about the assassination. And when brave people throughout the 60s, 70s and 80s were trying to tell the people the truth about what really happened, the skeptics came in and tried to debunk those people by calling them conspiracy nuts. Skeptics still to this day try to debunk Jim Garrison. Well, here we are now in 2011 and the skeptics are now the minority in believing the official government story that Oswald acted alone and that Kennedy was not shot from the front. It took over 40 years but now today the skeptics are the nuts and not the conspiracy theorists. This film by Oliver Stone has helped bring some suppressed information about the assassination to light and that`s why it`s a great movie.

Yes , there are shady characters that really existed like David Ferry , Clay Shaw , Guy Bannister and a host of others but Stone himself admits to taking quite a bit of poetic license with these characters .
After reading about the event and seeing a few scientific reenactments of the shooting itself , the only conclusion you can come to is that Oswald did the shooting .

Second, the most profound truthis that this criminal conspiracy of silence continues unto this day. and it amounts to an illegal tyrannical action  against all Americans by our own Government.  Each president the day after he takes the oath of office, when He fails to take action against these conspirators is an accessory after the fact, and a traitor.  The film ends with a statement and a challenge that is profound.  The past is prologue.  That past goes  up until the right now that confronts us with the moral imperative to band together and overthrow this criminal conspiracy, or acknowledge that not only are we living under a dictatorship, of the oligarchy. but that we are content to do so and admit that our claim to a democratic government is a sham.",1294272000,4,1150,4.715

97052,5,0790729733,"An emotional roller coaster. Armed with an outstanding cast, chilling music and intensifying filming angles, Oliver Stone has arguably created the finest film of his career. It was a brave attempt whose impact was so great that legislation was passed to disclose all assassination documents by late 2017. This film is not brilliant because it solves the Kennedy debate but because it examines all perspectives of the assassination, including the unlikely single shooter theory.

  This film follows the true story of the District Attorney of New Orleans Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) who begins his own investigation into the assassination after finding several flaws and contradictions in the Warren Commission. This film follows that shocking and revelatory investigation.

  Every American should experience JFK. The experience is shocking. As a proud American, I would prefer to accept the single shooter theory; but with solid research and a plethora of plausible alternatives presented, Oliver Stone forces me to accept that my government has the power to assassinate an American President. A single viewing of this epic is not enough. Not even after two, three or even four times did I absorb everything this film has to offer. It is to be watched multiple times and perhaps with a lots of reflection, viewers can draw their own conclusions.

  Stone has been intensely criticized for making this epic. He has even been compared to Nazi film director, Leni Riefenstahl. The critic who made this comparison and who shall remain anonymous, says Stone hyperbolizes historic facts and adds his own creative spin to the story to incite rebellious behavior in American youth. To a certain extent, that's true. Oliver Stone does include fictitious characters and does rewrite history with a biased pen, but in doing so, he is throwing more evidence at viewers to further persuade them that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone on November 22, 1963.

  I have spent countless hours contemplating the who and the how, but as the film states, ""The who and the how are just scenery for the public...It keeps them from asking the most important question. Why? Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefitted? Who has the power to cover it up? Who?""

  This should be mandatory viewing because regardless of personal beliefs, the assassination is history, monumental history.",1289606400,4,2358,5.168421052631579

""JFK"" dramatizes the events that led up to Kennedy's death on that fateful day in Dallas on November 22, 1963 and the subsequent days and months that Americans will never forget. The story is told through the eyes of a former New Orleans district attorney, Jim Garrison, played beautifully by Kevin Costner, and his belief that Lee Harvey Oswald did not murder the President and his opinion that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy by the U.S. government and other individuals.

 Oliver Stone directed and co-wrote ""JFK"" and based his work on two books that dealt with Kennedy's death. The movie went on to become one of the biggest films of the 1990's and was subsequently nominated for an amazing eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture, ultimately winning two for Best Editing and Cinematography. The film was also a financial giant grossing over $200,000,000 worldwide.

97073,1,0790729733,"Dear Oliver Stone,

JFK got shot?  You're kidding!  Is he all right?

(Geez, you miss the news one lousy day and you're out of touch.)

Seriously though, I, Yasha J. Banana -- at 96 years-old, the oldest living Amazon movie reviewer (if you call this living) -- personally, I didn't care for the flicker.

Not enough sex.

Okay, so it was about the murder of JFK.  I realize that, Oliver.  But what about all those groovy cheerleaders who were in ""On Any Given Sunday""?  A couple of them couldn't have played the doctors who did the autopsy?  Or maybe one of them could have played the hooker JFK had sex with the night before.

Not many people know this but I, Yasha J. Banana -- nonagenarian, hat blocker and one-time delicatessen manager in Mooseballs, Texas -- I almost got a part in ""JFK.""

Oh yeah!

Your assistant director wanted me to audition for one of the bullets.  But I said, ""Listen, boychick, let's face it, I'm not as fast as I used to be.  Besides, I'm a Democrat.""

Meanwhile, where was Jackie Kennedy in this movie?  You know, the wife.  After all, she saw the whole thing, didn't she?  And yet there wasn't a part for her in the  entire movie?  How come?  What, there weren't any shiksa actresses available at the time?

Nothing personal, Oliver, and don't take this the wrong way but if it was up to me, I'd go against type and cast Joan Rivers as Jackie Kennedy.

Joan Rivers, Jackie Kennedy -- could those gals shop!  But Joan has Jackie beat by a mile.  Reminds me of my fourth wife.  One time she lost her credit card.  But I didn't report it -- why should I -- the person who stole it bought less than she did.  (~Ba-da bing-bing!~)

And Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison.  A nice Gentile fellow; but, honestly, not my cup of tea; I would have preferred Henny Youngman in the role.  (""Take my case, please!"")

Here's Jim Garrison, a beleagured district attorney with a nearly impossible case to prove, and what do you do, Oliver, you get Kevin Costner, a goyische cup, to play the part.  Putz!

If Henny Youngman wasn't available you could have hired *my* lawyer to play the part.  Belongs to a big law firm, ""Ganef, Ganef, Ganef and Aquinas.""  Owns his own ambulance.  (Ba-da bing-bang-bing!)

Meanwhile, what about Jack Ruby, there's another brainstorm of yours.  You get Brian-Doyle Murray, an Irishman, to play the part!  *Jan* Murray would have been more like it.

Oliver, my boy, what were you thinking -- Jack Ruby was Jewish, not Irish.  What was the casting of this movie, restricted?

The only intriguing part of the movie for me was the scene where John Candy is eating in a restaurant.  I'm thinking to myself: did the guy who owned this restaurant take in a partner? -- the place was packed! it looked like it was a gold mine!

Oy, the money I could have made in Mooseballs, Texas with my ""GENTILES WELCOME"" concept delicatessan.

If only my ""Sheep Dip Surprise"" had caught on.  But who knew?

Anyway, call me sentimental but I felt sorry for that skinny little guy, what's his name, Leo Harvey Oswinkle.  The poor schnook.

Hunted, arrested, taken into custody and questioned, and what? not one policeman gave him a cup coffee, a piece pie?  Okay, so they could have gotten it from the store, but he had to eat, didn't he?

Where's the realism, Oliver Stone?  Where's the versimilitude?  All those newsmen questioning Leon Harvey Oswinkle and not one of them gave him a cookie or an orange to nosh on?  I doubt it.

Okay, Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby was Jewish.  This we know.  He changed his name from Rubenstein to Ruby.  This is an historic fact; and far be it from me, Yasha J. Banana, to suggest that your movie be intentionally inaccurate (ahem!) but what?, you couldn't have changed Jack Ruby's name to Art Linkletter?  Or, better yet, Jack Armstrong.  You know, blame it on the goyim for a change.

Either that or else make Jack Ruby a nebbish, a Woody Allen type.  So that instead of shooting the gun, he drops it.  Big deal, so you change the story around a little bit.  You changed so much, you couldn't have done that?

Historic license!  That's it, that's the ticket, my boy!

You've already got everybody and their brother-in-law in on the plot to kill JFK, so you take a little more license, what's it gonna hurt?  What's JFK gonna do, rise from the dead and sue you, serve you a paper?

Ahhh! but why cry over spilt milk, kosher or otherwise.  You made your movie, you made your millions, so what are you going to do now: from a a 96-year-old man on a fixed income you're going to take advice?  I don't think so.

For when you listen to me, my breath I'm not holding.

But let me just say one more thing so that I can finish this bombastic review and give myself an enema before I go to bed. ... I'm sorry about President Kennedy.  He was a fine man, a regular prince of a fellow.  For weeks I couldn't digest properly, I was so upset.  As far as a normal bowel movement was concerned, forget about it.

A couple hours before he got shot, I ate a pastrami sandwich.  Heard the news, couldn't pass that goddamn pastrami sandwich for three weeks.  A lump the size of Rhode Island in my kishkas.

What a tragedy; the nation suffered, I suffered.  Eventually we found relief.

You know, I have my own conspiracy theory.  Personally I think the pastrami sandwich I ate was a plot.  A plot by the Italians who live down the hall.  From the day I told them Alan Alda was half Jewish, they hated my guts.

Anyway, like I said, it was a shame President Kennedy got shot.  I feel worse about him than about that skinny Jew Abraham Lincoln, when he got shot in the temple.

If only, if only. ... If only JFK had ducked.  Would have been a different story altogether.  Less messy.  If nothing else, he could have gotten an allowance on the upholstery in the car.

But, that aside, let's face it, let's tell the truth, Ollie baby, you know as well as I do that JFK would have been much better off married to Joan Rivers.  Because if JFK was married to Joan Rivers, when the plane landed in Dallas, forget about Dealey Plaza, she would have dragged him to Nieman-Marcus and they would have shopped all day.  End of story.

Your pal,

Yash

P.S.  Before I go, so that this stupendous review should end with a bang, here's a peppy-perky little ditty I wrote in honor of JFK.

97076,2,0790729733,"I realize this movie was made in 1991, before a lot of research had pretty solidly confirmed the Warren Commission's findings, but that doesn't excuse the dishonesty presented in this fictionalized 'documentary'. When the president and the governor are placed in their 'properly assigned seats' (Kennedy seated to the right a few inches of the governor and leaning out the window, the governor sitting on a 'jump seat' a few inches higher than Kennedy) the need for a magic bullet disappears. There have been at least 2 moving car recreations (with real live dummies pretty closely resembling not only the size, but also the inside bodies of Kennedy and the governor.) In one of these recreations, the bullet wounds on the dummies match exactly the wounds on the actual bodies, minus the wound to the governor's thigh. (The bullet hit an extra 'rib' inside the dummy, and therefore didn't have enough momentum to injure the dummy's leg.

Some other less than honest claims...that Oswald was a poor shot. Not true. That Oswald couldn't get 3 shots off in 9 seconds. (A few marksmen were able to get off 3 shots, hitting the intended targets, in just under 9 seconds.) That he couldn't make it down 4 flights of stairs in 90 seconds without being winded. (A man of similar size and fitness was able to do it in 48 seconds without being winded.) That he couldn't make it to the point where he had the confrontation with the cop in under 15 minutes. (In another test, the same man was able to get to the destination in about 11 minutes.)

There have been a handful of documentaries shown on the Discovery Channel, History Channel, etc. Each of the above points, as well as many others, are demonstrated fairly clearly...Unsolved History: JFK Beyond the Magic Bullet; Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy; JFK: Case Not Closed; and Investigating History: JFK Assassination each dispel the mistruths demonstrated in the JFK movie. (all available on Amazon)

Bottom line, it's ok to have doubts about Oswald being the lone gunman, but the only hard evidence in this case all points to Oswald.

As far as the movie itself goes, I guess it was ok. The one scene that always stuck in my mind was the one with Joe Pesci getting choked by someone. In one frame, he has his hairpiece looking ok. As the choking continues, it flashes back between the hairpiece being halfway down his face, and then being back on right again. It looks something from a bad spoof movie. Or are we to believe that the guy choking him is also moving his hairpiece back and forth?",1265328000,2,2549,4.7342342342342345

This shouldn't come as a surprise as Oliver Stone has never let the truth get in the way of his movies.  Entertaining?  Yes, actually it is.

97094,5,0790729733,"I have this on DVD, and it's a terrific film that tells about one of the tragedies in American History. November 22, 1963 was the end of the innocence of this country when President Kennedy was assassinated. I wasn't alive at the time, but I've seen alot of footage surrounding this tragedy. I feel that there's cause for both sides....the one where the Warren Report said that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the killing of Kennedy, and the theory that's presented here that there was a second shooter. I honestly don't know how far a bullet can travel from M-1 rifle which I believed Oswald used, so it's possible that Oswald could've been the lone killer considering he was a sharpshooter in the Marines. I also think that there's creedence to there being a second shooter as the film shows the footage of Kennedy's motorcade, and one of the shots looks as though it hits Kennedy by his ear which to me would've been a hard shot for Oswald to pull off from where he positioned himself, so that opens up the possibility that someone stationed closer to ground as it looks like it's a side shot from the grassy knoll, or possibly behind it. As to who actually could've done this besides Oswald may never surface, and I saw an episode on the History Channel where it's been asserted that director Oliver Stone manipulated the footage of Kennedy's motorcade to show that Kennedy was assassinated by someone else. The History Channel asserts that Stone speeded up the footage to add a few extra frames. I assert that perhaps there was someone behind the grassy knoll, and possibly fired a rifle when he heard one go off, but that asks the question if there is another shooter who fired first? This may never be solved in this lifetime.

The actual story within this movie is about the lone trial in which someone is tried for having connections to Kennedy's Assassination, and the actual outcome of the trial was that he was found ""Not Guilty"", so that closes the lone attempt to find out the mystery surrounding the murder of President Kennedy. There are still alot of theories out there, but nothing to bring it all together. The film had an all-star crew ranging from John Candy to Kevin Costner. There was also memorable performances from Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, John Larroqutte, Sissy Spacek, and Jack Lemmon, and Walter Matthau. I don't know if this movie won any Oscars, or not, but if not then a grave mistake was made.",1251849600,,2432,4.655813953488372
97095,5,0790729733,"When Oliver Stone sat down to write and direct this picture, given that 95% of the data contained within was available in numerous books since the '60s and '70s, he must have expected the typically dismissive reaction those paperback treatises had largely received.

Instead, all Hell broke loose.

Not since the jaw-droppingly racist epic THE BIRTH OF A NATION seventy-six years earlier had a movie received such a startlingly prickly response or would become such a controversy.

Based rather loosely on New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison's prosecution of local businessman Clay Shaw regarding Shaw's alleged complicity in setting up Lee Harvey Oswald in the 1963 JFK assassination (""loosely"" because the investigation and trial is used as a format for presenting data uncovered in some cases by other investigators and at a later date) the picture is a mesmerizingly rich montage of fact and educated theory, Stone's quick-cuts editing style then highly unusual (though now used incessantly in movies about absolutely nothing) and evocative. He does an impressive job of communicating a massive amount of information to the audience in only about three hours. But it's exactly Stone's cinematic skill which caused ""JFK"" to explode into reviled critical consciousness in a manner all those assassination books never would, could or did.

Any honest student of the assassination won't be stunned by the content. But the media and governmental overreactive upsurge against the movie was almost more damning that the movie itself.

Even today, nearly two decades after the film was released, it's astounding how infamous it remains. Also astounding is how the LoneNut/Oswald-did-it mindset continues to hold on. If one checks out the numerous assassination Internet websites, for example, they are nearly all stalwart defenders of the Warren Commission, some surfacely affecting objectivity, some rabidly direct --- they are essentially the cyber version of Gerald Posner's 1993 ""Case Closed"", once called ""the most dishonest book ever written"" and a literary response to Stone's movie. ""Case Closed"" (and those websites) clearly know the data: they go into great, intricate detail in an effort to meticulously deconstruct all of the pro-conspiracy material.... only they deconstruct falsely. As anyone who knows the material will quickly realize. But, to the uninitiated, such sites' endless, 24/7 ""debunking"" (a favorite phrase by the fervent and on-message-beyond-belief LoneNut bloggers who haunt the Internet) of the conspiracy can appear quite convincing, just as these more casual audiences are so easily fooled by the authoritative yet selectively sloppy Untruths of Peter Jennings' 40th Anniversary Special for ABC in 2003 or (that other Stone's) ""Oswald's Ghost.""

The eternal rationalizations, the endless manipulations from the pro-Warren Commission crowd. The unending assertions of, ""Oh, I use to be a conspiracy believer, too, until I learned that.... ,"" and the ubiquitous world-weary faux tones of, ""Let's just finally get this behind us, people. If you would read the superb and painstaking investigation by ...... then, you would know that this was all concretely disproved years ago when.....""

On and on and on.

Apparently, the only massive conspiracy this seething, vitriolic army of LoneNutters finds credible is that countless otherwise unconnected witnesses --- even those first-hand witnesses from Dealey Plaza! --- all somehow colluded in their shameless efforts to clear Oswald, frame the CIA, or just to frame faceless gunman in the trees behind the picket fence. All for money or attention or to achieve some other unspecified spineless agendum.

At this late date, however, with nearly all of the conspirators presumably long gone (and ~75% of the American public still convinced of the conspiracy, as they have been since the '60s) why is maintaining The Lie so important in some corners? As clearly it is. It has, after all, been nearly half a century since Kennedy died on the streets of Dallas.

Perhaps because the dynamic behind the assassination of the 35th president (or the dynamic behind misrepresenting it) is still essentially in place. 'The Secret State' is an awfully mysterious phrase, but it simply reflects large corporate business interests and those interests' determined defense of their rights to circumvent our democratic processes at every possible turn... Up until the recent near-Depressional economic downturn, the national news media (generally in bed with the same corporations) wouldn't even fleetingly address arguably the most pressing issue of our time: corporate corruption and Big Business's stranglehold on all levels of our government. And even now, such coverage is superficial and grudging at best.

So when famed Watergate burglar E Howard Hunt's 2004 handwritten and audio-taped confession of personal and CIA/LBJ involvement in JFK's murder can't even receive coverage in the national media decades after the event, where are we still?

It seems there is no pro-conspiracy revelation, no matter how dramatic and credible, which can receive coverage. And no anti-conspiracy evidence, no matter how flimsy and contrived, which can't.

Many detractors have sneered that it's dreadful that millions of youngsters perceive the JFK assassination thru the ""distorted lens"" of Oliver Stone. But I say, ""Thank goodness for Oliver.""",1249344000,3,5402,5.478365384615385
97096,5,0790729733,"""JFK"" is not really so much about President Kennedy as it is about New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison and his attempt to find the truth about JFK's assassination, and if there was a conspiracy, to bring the conspirators to justice. Though he didn't get a conviction, he at least went farther than any other law enforcement entities. He brought a murder and conspiracy charge against one of the alleged participants. According to this movie, the jury believed there was a conspiracy, but they didn't feel his case met the burden of proof as far as the individual charged was concerned. Subsequently, it was revealed that he worked for the CIA.

""JFK"" is Oliver Stone's favorite Oliver Stone film. He considers it his 'Godfather.' ""JFK"" is also Oliver Stone's most controversial film, with some who share his high opinion, and others who consider it blasphemy, tantamount to treason. Walter Cronkite, who was at one time the most trusted man in America, thought it was rubbish. The head of at least one media empire suppressed a 34 word capsule review that was too favorable. The writer complained about it and was fired. I think they were killing the messenger because they didn't like the message.

-----------------------------
Jim Garrison: Thank you for your time, David. I'm sorry this has to end inconveniently for you but I am going to have to detain you for further questioning by the FBI.
David Ferrie: Why, what's wrong?
Jim Garrison: David, I find your story simply not believable.
David Ferrie: Really? What part?
==========================================

Likewise, some may find Oliver Stone's story simply not believable, but it is a lot more believable than the conclusions of the Warren Report.

-------------------
Jim Garrison: Once you conclude the magic bullet could not create all seven of those wounds, you'd have to conclude that there was a fourth shot and a second rifle. And if there was a second rifleman, then by definition, there had to be a conspiracy.
===========================

The director of a film can manipulate the truth -- omit certain details, highlight others, cherry pick certain facts to support his thesis, or completely fabricate from beginning to end. Fiction, as a literary form has been called ""lies that tell the truth"" and when you are talking about film, you just might be more in the realm of lies that tell even bigger lies."" But I think that JFK was researched and put together well, and it was much more than either mere entertainment or propaganda. It actually was very entertaining, but in a way that makes you think. Though the truth of what happened that day in November may be ""a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma"" -- obscured so much that we may never know the real truth, Oliver Stone has really done a masterful job. I think that just like Jim Garrison, Stone has shown that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, if he was in fact an assassin and not just a patsy. The sequence in the courtroom where Kevin Costner, as Jim Garrison, lays out his case that there was at least a second rifleman is a masterful sequence. Filmed in one long take, requiring prodigious memorization by Costner, it is the compelling highlight of  JFK. Once you get past the hurdle of the idea foisted on the American Public by the Warren Commission that JFK was killed by a lone assassin, then all kinds of questions open up. It really gets you thinking.

-----------------------
X: Fundamentally, people are suckers for the truth. And the truth is on your side, Bubba.
===========================

Most people who were alive when JFK was killed remember where they were that day. It seems that when JFK died, our innocence died also. Jello Biafra of the punk band, The Dead Kennedys says that the name of his group was thought up by some hippies, Grateful Dead Heads who threw it out as a possibility in a long list of possible names. He grasped the significance of that name, as it expressed the death of our innocence. Jerry Seinfeld, trying to deal with the fundamental contradiction -- the rift in our society, used humor. In a parody of ""the single bullet theory"" called, ""the single lugie theory"" a baseball player is spat on in an incident after a game. Wayne Knight, who played Newman, Jerry's nemesis, is in both the TV Show, and the film, ""JFK."" In both, he plays the same part in the courtroom reenactment. I don't know exactly what all this means, but I would submit for your approval that the JFK assassination is the tragic touchstone of our generation, and that Oliver Stone, in taking it as the subject of his film, was tackling the biggest issue of our time. It was bound to be controversial. Perhaps you will walk away from it still unconvinced. But even if it just gets you thinking, ""JFK"" has done its job.

97097,1,0790729733,"As a political progressive with a lifelong interest in forensics - perhaps triggered to some extent by my childhood experience of the Kennedy assassination - I don't know which dismays me more: Oliver Stone's `truth-y' fiction about the JFK assassination; the credulity of those filmgoers who've given it 5 stars; or the way `JFK' has become the definitive version of events in so many Americans' minds.

Actually, I can relate. When I first saw the film in 1991, I wept alongside many others in the audience, shaking with indignation at LBJ, the CIA, and all the others implicated in Kennedy's `execution'. In retrospect, we could all be forgiven for our gullibility.  After all, `JFK' used real footage and was about real people, and its director had appeared on countless news shows, passionately defending himself and saying in all sincerity that he wished for nothing more than to set the record straight.  The conspiracy in the movie was, he claimed, a composite of the various true findings by researchers and investigators, and although he had employed `dramatic license' here and there, he stood by the basic conclusions.  Garrison was a hero who was onto something. Oswald & Ruby were pawns in a CIA conspiracy. The highest levels of government were directly involved.

`JFK' also boasted a terrific cast. It was hard to take your eyes off people like Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, and Gary Oldman.  (One bizarre note: the real Jim Garrison could be spotted in a cameo playing Earl Warren - a nasty irony if ever there was one.) Then there were the actual figures of the day, cleverly spliced from newsreel footage and conscripted into Stone's service without permission in order to lend the proceedings a veneer of documentary verisimilitude.

Make no mistake: `JFK' was exceedingly well-crafted - its editing and cinematography won Academy Awards - and my wife and I found the result powerfully compelling. Here's the problem: `JFK' is a crock. The movie not only gets the facts wrong, but willfully and hurtfully so.

Let's put things in perspective: JFK, LBJ, Oswald, Ruby, Clay Shaw, and Jim Garrison were real human beings. Understanding who they were and what they did is worthwhile and potentially precious to a country and its people trying to make sense of a painful event in the past that changed the course of history. But when a director - Oliver Stone or anyone else on the right or left - decides to portray history using actual footage and characters, success cannot be defined simply in cinematic terms. This is particularly true when director and producers are exploiting a national tragedy - think 9/11 - and profiting from it in direct proportion to the intensity of our feelings about it.

Frankly, I question Stone's motives. Surely he knew he was doctoring the facts, not merely indulging in `dramatic license', when his characters made demonstrably false claims about Oswald's skill as a marksman, the timing of the shots, and the so-called `magic bullet' that careful examination has revealed to have been perfectly ordinary in trajectory and effect. By 1991, when `JFK' was made, there was little doubt that the Warren Commission's findings about these matters were correct: Oswald was a crack marksman whose Marine target practice scores show he could hit rapid-fire bullseyes at 200 yards - more than twice as far as in Dealey Plaza.  He knew how to fire and reload the Carcano rifle smoothly and accurately, unlike Gary Oldman, and probably took 8.3 seconds instead of 6 or 7 because he lingered on the last shot for accuracy, as plenty of other marksmen have since demonstrated.

But the biggest absurdity of `JFK' was the very premise at the heart of the movie - that the deeply disturbed, manipulative, grandiose paranoid Jim Garrison was some kind of American hero. He wasn't, and his malevolent conduct was quite different than that portrayed in the film. For the record, it only took the jury 45 minutes to acquit Clay Shaw. Garrison outed him as a gay and ruined his life, but Shaw had nothing whatsoever to do with Oswald...and neither did Carlos Marcello, Sam Giancana, Fidel Castro, LBJ, or the CIA.

It has been hard for many Americans to accept the truth about the JFK assassination.  If you look at the state-of-the-art forensic and computer analyses of the assassination that have been done in the past two decades, it is clear that Oswald acted alone.  Furthermore, he did it in a surprisingly coincidental, random fashion after reading in the Dallas papers on November 16th that the presidential motorcade was going to pass right in front of the building where he'd gotten a job one month earlier.  As is well-known, when Oswald made the decision to commit an assassination, he actually had a different target in mind: the ultraconservative General Edwin Walker, who lived across town. Unlike the Kennedy murder, the Walker attack on April 10th was carefully planned for more than a month and included surveillance, an alias, and mail-order purchases of a pistol and then a rifle. Of course, both were eventually put to other uses on November 22nd.

Remember, Oswald was an expert Marine-trained sharpshooter. Detectives estimated that his one shot at Walker from 30 yds would have been a hit if it hadn't been deflected by the window's crossframe, whose fragments struck Walker and knocked him out of range. Oswald was also volatile, erratic, and rage-filled - a loose cannon who had called an inordinate amount of attention to himself in the preceding year with his pro-Castro antics and embassy visits.  He was not the sort of man who would likely have been recruited by the CIA, KGB, or the Mob.  The same goes for Jack Ruby, whose decision to kill Oswald was clearly impulsive - he had actually gone out on Sunday morning to drop by the Western Union office and wire some cash to a stripper in his employ. On the way home he swung by the police station, and when he saw the commotion outside, he decided to park the car, leaving one of his beloved dogs on the front seat while he ran inside to catch a last glimpse of Oswald.  Ruby, a staunch Kennedy supporter who had been obsessively hanging out at the station since Friday, later told his rabbi that when he saw Oswald smiling, he snapped - `I just had to shoot him'.  Of course, he thought everyone else felt exactly the same way he did, and was reportedly stunned to learn that murdering Oswald had not made him a national hero.

But why was Ruby carrying a gun? He was a strip club operator who disdained bouncers and often threw out unruly customers himself. His friends and employees later said that he always carried a loaded revolver - hardly abnormal in Texas culture then or now. It's likely he'd wrestled all weekend long with his rage at Oswald, and perhaps with the notion of shooting him. When Ruby went out to Western Union that Sunday morning, though, he didn't know it was going to be his last hour of freedom. He just happened to show up at 11:20, and out walked Oswald at 11:21. It all happened in an instant, as so many murders do.

Was Ruby part of a conspiracy? In the film he's depicted surreptitiously planting the `magic bullet' on a hospital gurney, but the idea was as preposterous in 1991 as it is today, and Stone knew it.

Back to Dealey Plaza - forensics, computer simulations, and reenactments of the shooting have all been consistent with the autopsy findings and demonstrate that both `hits' -  the Kennedy-Connally first shot, and the fatal head wound third shot - were fired from the 6th floor window of the Texas Book Depository, not from the picket fence or grassy knoll. The first shot passed through the president and then the governor in a relatively straight line, not the zigzag claimed by the movie Garrison. Although flattened in the process, the recovered slug was sufficiently intact - though hardly `pristine' - to be matched conclusively to both Oswald's rifle and the fragments in Connally's right wrist.  As for the third shot, a careful examination of the cratered entry wound in the posterior aspect of Kennedy's right parietal bone, coupled with a comparison to his filmed position at the instant of impact, confirms that the bullet was fired from above and behind.  The subsequent head motion `back and to the left' - endlessly intoned by Costner in a truly dreadful sequence - could be expected and has been replicated numerous times in various kinds of simulations.  This was all in the Warren Commission report, and available to Stone.

In forensic, behavioral, and circumstantial terms, the case against Oswald as the lone gunman was always overwhelming and extremely robust.  Were it taken to trial - then or now - conviction would be a certainty. But if you ask a broad sample of Americans for their opinion about the JFK assassination, a majority believe the movie version is closer to the truth. In my view, this is yet another layer of the Kennedy tragedy, a fire on which Stone et al have thrown gasoline.  `JFK' is an entertaining film, to be sure, but for the wrong reasons. The Kennedy assassination was one of the most shocking, puzzling, and painfully tragic events in the lives of many Americans, and yet somehow Stone managed to exploit and distort its indelible images into a film  that is anti-history, and whose legacy is ignorance. One star, and less if I could.",1247961600,26,9375,4.826059850374065
97098,4,0790729733,"The film:

Plenty of ink has been spilled with regard to Oliver Stone's ""JFK."" I won't add much to a critical debate of it. I think it is enormously entertaining as a movie, is a valuable exercise in stirring up doubts and passions about a critical period in our history, and is a superb exercise in style - no other film better captures the ""through the looking glass"" feel that anyone who has researched this topic must feel. I watch this film every other year or so, and I never tire of revisiting the dense, compelling world Stone has created. This or that aspect of the film's thesis may be outdated or inaccurate, but that's not the point. The point is to stir up doubts, and plenty of the material Stone has presented in this drama still succeeds at that.

The Blu-Ray:

The video transfer is a faithful and restrained HD version of this film. It preserves quite well all of the wildly different film stocks that Stone employs. Black and white material is quite detailed and has a lovely grain structure. Color footage varies in lighting and filters depending on the year portrayed and the mood. So some material is quite hazy, while other material is relatively sharp. All of it is a good upgrade over previous DVD editions. The audio is a good Dolby TrueHD 5.1ch mix that presents dialogue and John Williams' wonderful score very well.

Extras are where I have some problems with this disc. Several features from previous DVD editions (and there have been MANY) did not make it into this one, and the ones we have are of a generally low quality. The best of the bunch is 1 hour of cut and extended scenes. They are presented in 480p SD, with the option of a Stone commentary. Many are just extensions of existing scenes, however. A 90-minute film called ""Beyond JFK The Question of Conspiracy"" is a making-of with critical review and interviews of experts. It admirably tries to present all sides, but the production values are terrible. A new 30-minute doc about declassified documents post 1992 is kind of meandering and tough to follow. Unfortunately it ends up sounding like a conspiracy nut (it is narrated by the editor of a conspiracy magazine) happily confirming his own previously held opinions. Finally, we have an 11-minute shot on video interview with Fletcher ""Mr. X"" Prouty. A/V quality is terrible and for the most part nothing terribly interesting is said. In the end, as far as extras go, there have been much better productions by various outlets (BBC, History Channel, CBS, PBS) that you would do much better to watch than these extras. The best extra on this disc is Stone's commentary.

The packaging is a ""digibook,"" a nice idea that doean't really deliver. We get some pap about the movie's critical reception, and some biography pages of the director and actors. Which is to say, nothing that isn't better done than it is on the Internet. We also do NOT get a list of materials on the Blu-Ray. Kind of irritating, if you ask me.

***********

This is a must-own for Oliver Stone fans. It's one of his best films, easily. It is taut (quite a thing to say about a 3.5 hour film), moving, thrilling, and provocative. It caused a huge stir upon its release and had a real effect on the government, inspiring Congress to act to release documents. It's definitely one of the most important films of the 1990s, and any cinema fan should own it.

It's not a perfect edition. The Video is good but not great, owing to the stylistic choices of Stone himself. It's way better than the DVD, though, and may be the best it can look on Blu-Ray. What is not better than some previous DVDs are the extras in this edition. So buy this edition for the film itself, not for the supplements.

One final note: there are two anniversaries coming up - 2011 marks the 20th anniversary of the film itself. 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination. Take it for what you will, but I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that there will be a new edition of this movie on Blu-Ray during one of those years. This edition will probably have an entire extra disc of extras filmed in HD and produced at a much higher level. The film itself may also look better, given inevitable advances in film transfer technology and the learning curve of a new format (think of how DVD looks now vs. in 1997...).

97110,5,0790729733,"Before I watched this film for the first time in 2003, I regarded the JFK assassination as a mere detail of history - a President killed by a gunman out to extinguish the imagined villain of his own personal tormented mind. Boy, was I wrong! Watching JFK opened a whole new window for me and I walked away with more questions than answers on the assassination. You may certainly challenge the conclusions of this movie (or rather Jim Garrison) but you cannot deny the many holes it punches into the official line. In my personal view the circumstantial evidence does suggest conspiracy at a high level bordering on treason. My readings post viewing JFK have led me to believe (like many others) that JFK was martyred because of his refusal to toe the line of the covert empire builders (the military industrial complex or whatchamacallit). The assassination was an inflection point in history and as we look at the subsequent fate of the world it is hard not to ask the question of what might have been had JFK survived. Do watch this movie for its sheer epic scale, great direction, and the questions it raises. It is a great piece of cinema even if you have issues with the politics of Oliver Stone.",1242518400,,1201,4.616822429906542

Altbough some of the more abstract conspiracy theories will make you rub your head, there's no doubt that there were alot of mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, not the least of which was the arrest of Oswald and the defense he himself put forth the short time he was in custody.

This is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen.  Beautifully edited, with a terrific performances (Gary Oldman is so eerie as Oswald, you'd think they had resurrected the lone assassin), this is definitely Oliver Stone's masterpiece in a canon of interesting films.

The scope of the film is epic, and although he gives you a hodgepodge of theories, the beauty of this picture is that you, the audience, can walk away with your own theory.  But most importantly, Stone's message is that we the people must take a stance and interest in our government and hold those who break the law accountable.  We need to question those around us.  And above all, we must demand PEACE from our leaders and for the world.

When I saw this film in 1991, is was overwhelmed by it's sheer power and unforgettable imagery.

97113,5,0790729733,"If you ever thought about Eisenhower's wise words in his farewell speech : ""beware of the military-industrial complex"", and kept wondering what he really meant, well, look at this film.  President Kennedy wanted a Pax Americana for the world.  (By the way, when was the last time you ever heard those words ?)  President Kennedy wanted to make peace with the Soviet Union, and he wanted to retreat all troops from Vietnam by 1965.  The day after he was killed, Johnson took over and immediately sent more troops to Vietnam.  The US would stay there till 1975.  The war was lost in human and political terms, but the ""military-industrial"" complex got richer and more powerful.  Bell sold their helicopters, General Dynamics their fighters, etc.  War is the biggest industry in the US, but the public doesn't know how it works.  We aren't allowed to know, because of ""national security"".  So there's a lot of money to be made, since furthermore, there's no sharp line to be drawn between the military ordering equipment and the industry offering it.

This film is very important.  It shows the exact point in history when the US lost the very significance of its democracy.  Since then, the US are an evil empire, where foreign politics doesn't depend on the personal ideas of the elected president, but on what the military-industrial complex wants.  Obama already said he would increase the defense budget.  He also said he wanted to retreat troops from Iraq, but immediately added that the situation in Afghanistan merits more attention.  Obama promised change, but he didn't even remove the secretary of Defense of Bush !  What kind of change is this ?  In his place, I would be scared to death also.  Remember Kennedy fired Dulles from the CIA, and who ""helped"" trying finding out who killed president Kennedy in the Warren commission ?  Yeah, precisely : his good old buddy Dulles...  What kind of ""democracy"" is this ?

This film shows in quite some detail how the conspiracy was forged.  To begin with, all standard security procedures were violated.  The major of Dallas changed the route of the presidential car, so that it included a slow turn.  A lonely shooter was blamed, and killed before the public could hear him say he really worked for the military intelligence - where he was taught Russian and was sent to Russia as a double agent.  He just managed to say to the cameras he was ""a patsy"".  Then Ruby, Oswald's killer, was injected with cancer cells, so he couldn't tell who was ordering him.  Immediately after the killing of Kennedy, CBS reported that ""president Kennedy was hit by three shots"" !  How did they know that ?  Who said that anyway ?  It was false, to begin with.  The Zapruderfilm showed there were at least six shots !  And to prevent the truth to emerge, the autopsy of Kennedy was interrupted by some admirals, taking the corpse away to Washington, where the brain of Kennedy ""was lost"" and the photos of his dead body manipulated.  More intriguing is that in New Zealand the newspapers had the full story of Oswald and his fake biography four hours before he was actually charged with the murder of the president, following Colonel Fletcher Prouty, X in the film, and author of the book ""JFK - The CIA, Vietnam and the plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy"".

Hitler said in ""Mein Kampf"" : The bigger the lie, the more credibility it gets, ""since it would never come into the heads of the people to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation.""

Ambassador Joseph Wilson said : ""... a majority of Americans, wanting to trust in the president and his words, actually came to believe that Saddam had nuclear weapons and was somehow responsible for the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.""

Now, in the fake democracy the US is nowadays, it seems very likely that even 9/11 was orchestrated by the military-industrial complex.  I know you'll probably have problems believing this.  I had trouble to believe it myself, I'll tell you.  Hear me out, and above all : compare with what happened to Kennedy.  To begin with, the murderer was immediately identified.  No need to go through a thorough investigation.  Osama bin Laden was blamed immediately by Bush.  How did they know that ?  This is very weird, taking into consideration that the intelligence was apparently a total mess, since those attacks happened in the first place.  Now, as happened in the case of Oswald, Osama bin Laden was CIA, and the saying goes : once CIA, always CIA.  Now, if you have a suspect, like Osama bin Laden, then it's even stranger that you let all his family members fly away on 9/12, when not a single other plane in the US was allowed to fly.  Probably, like with Oswald, the military-industrial complex was not interested that the public became aware of the connections Osama bin Laden still had with the CIA, or maybe they didn't want to reveal the relationship of the Bush and the bin Laden families, shown by Michael Moore in his film Fahrenheit 9/11.  What's for sure is that the White House wasn't interested in a investigation.  George W. Bush also interfered with Congress investigating the attacks, saying - on the record, see Fahrenheit 9/11 : ""It's important for us not to reveal how we collect information.  That's what the enemy wants.""

We also have a clear problem with some ""evidence"" that was shown to all of us on 9/11.  They told us the Pentagon was hit by a plane.  Have you ever taken a close look to the small hole that was made in the building ?  This is far too small for a large 767.  There weren't any remains of a fuselage, the motors, the wings, no, nothing at all, let alone some bodies...  Compare with any other plane crash you have seen photos of...

To make the similarities with the Kennedy assassination complete, it is also very intriguing that the BBC announced the collapse of the Solomon Brothers Building (WTC7), a huge skyscraper, 23 minutes before it actually happened !  Even worse, when they announced it, you could still see the building erect on the live images behind the speaker.  Don't believe me.  I don't ask you that.  I prefer you check it out for yourself : do a web search with the words ""Solomon brothers collapse BBC"".

Now, the collapse of the Solomon Brothers building is at the same time the ""magic bullet mystery"" of 9/11.  I do not know of any law or force in nature that when two skyscrapers collapse, it will always take a third skyscraper down.  In this way, the Solomon Brothers represents the ""magic collapse mystery"" of 9/11.

As with the Kennedy killing, we have to look beyond the facts, and ask WHY this happened, and take a look on the consequences of this ""attack"".  The list is as follows : (1) the war in Afghanistan, (2) the invasion of Iraq, (3) the Patriot Act, limiting our democratic, civil rights and (4) the Guantnamo prison, where people were jailed without legal defense and even tortured.

When presidents of the US draw a line between Good and Evil, I always feel uncomfortable.  We first had to be aware of the Soviet Union, the ""Evil Empire"".  Now, Iraq, Iran and North Korea are considered the ""Axis of Evil"".  Bill Hicks saw it a little different : ""One day, we might find out that WE are the evil empire"".",1234483200,11,7492,4.665648854961832
97114,5,0790729733,"What really has set the Left back is not just the failure of this film medium to accomplish their goals, but also the lack of faith accorded college professors, school textbooks, and mainstream news. So who is left to tell the real story?
Weeeeeell, my friends, we are out there. We have been waiting in the wings all these years, gathering the facts in silence, not showing our hand, waiting for judgment day. The day of reckoning is upon us. Let freedom reign.
As for ""JFK"", it is a complicated piece of fiction that would require some real research to effectively discredit all of its lies. What it did in the theatre was have one asking, ""Jeez, did that really happen?"" or ""My God, is this true?"" or ""Holy cow, I can't believe this could be."" It is major sensory overload. Innocent civilians who knew things are killed. Deception and murder are used to cover up the sordid deeds. The film requires several viewings, and frankly time, probably years, to unravel it. What happens is that various reviews, reports from historical figures and historians are read and pieced together. After a while the discovery is made that a particular ""witness"" never existed, a certain ""police officer"" is a figment of Stone's imagination, smoke in the trees, conversations, special ops guys with the inside scoop (particular ""Major X"" played by Canadian Donald Sutherland) are invented out of whole cloth. A proposition is one thing, but ""JFK"" is ""Alice in Wonderland"", a ""riddle wrapped inside an enigma, tied by a puzzle"" or whatever it is Joe Pesci says. It is exhausting.
So who killed JFK? Oh, maaaaan! Stone's answer, as best I can tell, was Lyndon Johnson, in league with the joint chiefs, because Kennedy wanted out of Vietnam and they wanted in (because American industry needed the war?), working with right wing Birchers, who were part of rogue elements of the CIA (?), who were a ""track,"" whatever that is, that could not be stopped because it was an inexorable connection starting in Guatemala (""good""), Iran (""good""), and Bay of Pigs (""not so good""), that had become dominated by Cuban exile ""Republicans,"" working in league with the Soviets (KGB?), who recruited Lee Harvey Oswald, who learned to shoot in the Marines, who lived and married in Russia then came back, who promoted Marxism but was funded by Birchers (?), who was a patsy for the Dallas Mafia, who had Oswald-lookalikes say incriminating things, who worked with JFK, who worked with La Casa Nostra (who turned on him?), who were tied to Naval Intelligence (?), who operated out of a corner in New Orleans in which the Feds, the NIS and somebody else all had offices, who were tied to right wing homosexual businessmen, defrocked priests, gay prostitutes and guys with tempers like Ed Asner, whose activities were known by corrupt New Orleans lawyers and politicians, who were in league with the New Orleans International Trade Mart or something like that, protected by Dallas strip club owners, who hatched a plan that involved Cubans training in the Florida swamps or Latin America by gay militia commandos, who bought a bad Italian rifle with a bolt action release via mail instead of purchasing a better weapon through the black market or a store, who gave it to Oswald, who may or may not have fired at JFK but could not possibly have hit his mark from the Texas Book Depository, who with Secret Service agents working to kill the President had assassins disguised as police officers and bums in the bushes, a car wreck lot and a grassy knoll, and created a triangulated cross-fire that killed the President then got away.
Now, friends and neighbors, after all of that, at no time does Mr. Stone suggest that the assassination was the work of a fellow he later visited and said was a great man, named Fidel Castro, who is the most likely suspect.
Res ipsa loquiter.
Castro and the mob? Maybe. The confusion of Stone's plot twists is highly, precisely and to quintessential effect that with which the real killers want. Stone's film vastly hurts the attempt to learn the truth. He raises plenty of legitimate questions, mainly regarding the so-called ""magic bullet,"" and he operates on at least one fairly solid foundation, which is that the Zapruder film seems to show more than one shooter. Saying Oswald was not a lone gunman is a premise I can give credence to, but beyond that God knows.
One thing is puzzling, and that is that in all the years since nobody has ""stepped forward."" Every so often somebody shows up on Larry King Live and says his father, usually a ""Dallas cop,"" was the shooter, but these stories always have the crackpot feel to them. I want a deathbed confession from a Cuban, one of Sam Giancana's guys, something solid. When all the smoke clears, you still have a Communist sympathizer, Oswald, killing a President who just humiliated Kruschev over the Bay of Pigs, is a threat to Castro and is building up troops to fight Commies in Vietnam. It is plausible he had help and they were on the Grassy Knoll, they got away and Jack Ruby killed Oswald to shut him up. Maybe a little too convenient. The Warren Commission report came out only one year later, not enough time to sort out everything. The Church hearings were too open to get the real stuff beyond salacious sex. Secret CIA/FBI investigations might have been the only real answer, and who knows, maybe they were conducted, and maybe the gullible public cannot handle the truth. Who knows? Not Oliver Stone.",1233878400,,5460,4.76663146779303

97116,2,0790729733,"A total work of fiction and a sham. 'JFK' is the lie perpetrated on the American people. It has contributed to the nonsense that there was a conspiracy - it is convincing when it presents the 'facts' but this film is full of errors. Also, as an artistic film, the strength of the story / emotional drama etc... is carried by the gravity of the evidence / material but one you realize this is all a fake and a Hollywood bastardization of the truth it falls apart factually and artistically.

This film has more holes than a wicker canoe. True, some of the evidence was 'gospel' when the film was made but many errors and half truths made it into the film as absolute fact. Some examples:
-Oswald was a lousy shot: in truth he was an expert shot and a sharpshooter - they even have his shooting tests from the military
-3 shots in 6 seconds - it wasn't. It was 8.3 seconds, and it's easy (time-wise)
-the head back and to the left - the wound evidence that Cyril Wecht has made a career out of criticizing is conclusive that he was shot from the rear. Conservation of momentum shows that if a huge heavy chunk of head moves away at high speed that the body will move in the opposite direction - in fact ANY direction is possible depending on the entry and where the fragments blow out
-the magic spinning bullet - anyone with 2 eyes who has really looked at the Zapruder film can see that when that shot was fired that Connelly was sitting lower than JFK, towards the middle of the car, and sharply turned - not sitting square and facing forward as shown in the film - when you connect the lines it make a perfect straight line
-the pristine bullet - it was not pristine, the groove pattern matched the rifle, PROVING it was fired by the rifle found in the book depository and there are missing fragments that were found in Connolly.
-I don't remember if it was in the film, but the microphone evidence has all been disproved

Also, Garrison's testimony in the real case relied ona  witness who admitted he never saw Clay Shaw, Ferry and Oswald together - when asked under a polygraph yes or no, he said 'well if you ask me yes or no, it would have to be a no'

Garrison suborned perjury in this case - that seems clearer and clearer over time. We don't want to accept that this dysfunctional insignificant human being who even the soviets got bored of (and realized he was useless as a piece of propaganda and sent him back) could possibly have cut down such a great historical figure. We don't WANT to believe that, but it is true. Garrison makes him out to be a hero double agent! For God's sake, this guy was a personality disorder whose only double agent work was trying to act tough and be a commie wanna-be who would annoy anti-Castro Cubans then later appear on TV to advocate Marxism. He was an attention hound ! The 60s weren;t today - not everybody got on TV looking for 15 minutes of fame like today - you had to try hard... He would constantly mix himself up with these people to stir the pot like all dysfunctional personality disorders who live off the reaction they create in others. That's why everyone think he's tied up in some conspiracy - because of the company he kept, his changing positions etc...but in reality he was playing people for reactions. It's pathetic, really.

So save your money and watch any of the excellent documentaries that tear this apart entirely. And don't (like me) waste any money on 'The Men WHo Killed Kennedy' documentary from the UK either - more pseudo-science with a deep british narrator's voice which is also full of errors and omissions and even wilder theories than in 'JFK'

People like pathologist Wecht have done a huge disservice further stirring this pot. Sure the gov't has screwed up aspects of the investigation and autopsy etc.. Show me anything they get right!

It's time to stop this nonsense once and for all - don't waste your money on the upteenth reissue of this dog of a film and make Stone ever richer than he already is. Look for a book or documentary that tells you the real story.

So, yawn, this is all phony Hollywood melodrama.

This film tackled a lot in it's 3+ hours, but it did not get into the Oswald sightings/impersonations.  I guess that is neither here nor there, but I would have loved to see what Stone's theory on those episodes were.

Now, as far as the BD itself is concerned, the picture is true HD, although it does not look spectacular in the beginning due to artistic purposes, but as the color comes in, the quality also does as well.  The sound IS HD and you can hear the clear different switching from Dolby to Dolby TrueHD.

I am not too crazy about these book cases, but since this film is now almost 20 years old (hard to believe!), the book help to recall some things that were forgotten when this was coming out.

I noticed in the film that the Paines and Johnny Carson were left out of the film.  I assume it has to do with legal matters.  While Costner's performance won rave reviews, it would have been nicer if he tried to mimic Garrion's voice, which seems easy enough to do.

This of course is a must have film, especially if you are into history and while we wait for the government to develop a good excuse for what really happened when they let us know.

97143,3,0790729733,"As someone who experienced the assassination of President Kennedy as an 11 year old, I found myself rather engrossed in Oliver Stone's JFK.  I knew more about the assassination than the later trial in New Orleans.  Frankly, that whole episode seemed like a political side show.  However, I'm glad to have found out more about Garrison's investigation.  My own personal opinion of the assassination was that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.  The surge of conspiracy books and theories was overwhelming in the years after 1963.  I recall an earlier film that I believe was titled ""Executive Action"" which starred, among others, Robert Ryan and Burt Lancaster.  An impressive part of that film was the closing list of all the people directly or indirectly involved in the investigation who had died under unusual circumstances.  Frankly, it was the enormity of those who believed in a conspiracy that gave me the greatest assurance that there was none.  After all, how would you keep such an elaborate scheme such a secret over so many decades?  People eventually talk and the theory that those who knew were eliminated ignored the presumed fact that this would merely end up involving more and more people.

As a practical person, I found myself caught in between my self-assurance and the suspenseful creation of the conspiracy in ""JFK"".  I decided, for the sake of art appreciation, to just let myself enjoy the movie...and I did.  My one objection to the movie was the depiction of Garrison's family life.  It slowed down the movie, distracted us from the suspense, and unnecessarily made a bigger hero out of Jim Garrison than the movie required.  If it were all true then what did his homelife matter?

""JFK"" excels because even non-believers can set reality aside and enjoy an excellent suspenseful drama.  The acting, directing, writing etc is all very well done.

As a side light to ""JFK"", the next movie I watched was ""The Paralax View"".  I had no idea that I was watching essentially the same political assassination theme.  This one went out of its' way to be out on the fringe.  It's concept of assassination for assasination's sake made me realize that Oliver Stone knew that the greater the dose of reality, the more engrossing the suspense.  I got to thinking that too much of this sort of movie could be a bad thing.

97144,3,0790729733,"More has been written on this historical event than any other in history and I'll add a couple worthless lines of my own (if for no other reason than for some reason I decided to write up a bunch of reviews for spy/ conspiracy flicks on Amazon). I have virtually no interest in JFK or who killed him or why. The president that exists in popular imagination and media is largely a fabrication. The very fact Kennedy's brief time in the White House came to labeled ""Camelot"" perfectly illustrates mankind's tragic susceptibility to propaganda and favoring of myth over mere facts and empirical evidence. Always look at the voting record. Always look at the record. First thing to say is this is a movie. People always are saying, ""It's just a movie"" and of course often times because somebody they're responding to at least in their judgement is taking things too seriously. Well, I'd venture to say that this is indeed a great and in some ways brilliant movie, especially the editing. JFK is a classic crime mystery and political thriller. 4.5 Stars for the movie. However, Oliver Stone's JFK is not a subsitute for reading some of the many books--some of which aren't crazy at all--on this event. Oliver Stone wanted his film to challenge the official story, particularly the Warren Commission Report which he simply regards ""a great myth"". Stone took it upon himself to fight this myth, ""And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a countermyth"". Keep this in mind when considering the movie.

For my part I think Oswald did it and probably acted alone with nobody else involved in planning and carrying out the hit. A case hasn't been made to really convict any other individual or group even if there have indeed been many doubts and suspicions cast, most of which are unreasonable. But what if ""X"" individual or group was involved? What of it now? Without getting into the byzantine labyrinth of JFK assassination conspiracy theories I'd just briefly mention that as far as the bigger ones go in which fairly large numbers of people are involved--sometimes from different governmental agencies and other groups--these are mostly discredited by the fact that their isn't more proof of them and at this late date no death bed confessions.

And here we are as I add my 2 cents and people are still obsessing over this assassination. If you want to know what you can do for your country I would at least guess Kennedy would be of the opinion that you'd serve the common good by focusing on the many problems at hand, in the world now, geting involved with others doing work--taking action--to make America a great nation and in doing this you would best serve the idealism that JFK came to symbolize. That's how you fight the forces of darkness. Besides you don't ask what the government can do for you because it doesn't care about doing any good for most citizens--you join with other citizens to force the government to live up to its promise.

97151,5,0790729733,"I have made it pretty clear in the past that Oliver Stone is a director I just don't really get.  He is lauded by many and he is considered to be one of the most controversial directors of our time, but every film of his that I have seen has proved to be less controversial and more boring and absurd.  He just seems to miss the point.  I know that some do not agree, but I also know that I am not the only one to feel this way.

A friend of mine the other day stated that Stone was an `enemy of fun'.

That said; I absolutely adore `JFK'; I mean, utterly and unconditionally flaunt this film as one of the greatest political thrillers of all time.  From the first few seconds of footage I was completely engulfed in this film, and Stone's dedicated delivery never let up.  I was blown away because I really expected to pass over this as merely decent at best, but I honestly am taken aback by just how brilliant this film really is.  From the acting to the script to Stone's masterful art of filmmaking, `JFK' is an unforgettable masterpiece if I do say so myself.

It's safe to say that I really had no idea what this movie was about before I sat down to watch it.  I actually thought that Kevin Costner was playing Kennedy himself, that's how `in the dark' I was about the true nature of this film.  Instead, Costner plays district attorney Jim Garrison, a man on a mission.  After the horrendous murder of John F. Kennedy, Garrison makes it his personal agenda to bring the man (or men) responsible down.  When Lee Harvey Oswald is arrested and then murdered Garrison smells foul play and so he, along with his team, pursues the truth at all costs.  As Garrison sinks deeper into the seedy underbelly of deceit and betrayal he uncovers a truth that sadly only he can see, and this truth (what is truth really?) causes more problems than good for Garrison and his family.

First and foremost I really need to praise the script, up and down, inside and out because it is pristine on all fronts.  Not only is the film informative but it is engaging.  It doesn't just throw random facts at you and expect you to follow along.  Instead, it lines each commanding sequence of events with facts that melt down off the screen and caress our minds.  We never feel like we're being preached to, and we never feel like we're being manipulated.  We are merely being told a story, and story that twists itself and morphs into something so much bigger than we ever could have expected.  The opening sequences that map out Kennedy's term and his horrific murder are brilliantly constructed, for they immediately engulf you into this tragic tale.  The reshot footage of the murder is spellbinding and gut wrenching and totally effective in getting the audience immersed in the film from the very beginning.

Then there is the acting, all of which is superb.  I normally find Costner rather dull (except his wildly brilliant turn in `The Upside of Anger') and here he does skirt around to prospect of boring me (he just has a very monotone delivery) but he really pulls it all together when he needs to (his final courtroom monologue is brilliantly delivered).

The rest of the extensive cast though never misses a beat.  Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman take highest praises from me.  Jones (who was Oscar nominated) is sublimely sleazy as Clay Shaw.  There is a scene where he is being interrogated by Garrison and as he denies all the allegations he carries this smirk of satisfaction across his face that sent chills down my spine.  Kevin Bacon (who I am never fond of) is masterful here and Oldman is just plain chilling as Lee Harvey Oswald.  Singling anyone out is very hard though.  Joe Pesci is on the top of his game, as is Michael Rooker, and Sissy Spacek is heartbreaking as Garrison's conflicted wife.  Jack Lemmon, John Candy and Walter Matthau make the most of their limited screen time, and Donald Sutherland is flawlessly captivating in his cameo as the informant X.

The star of this film is none other than Oliver Stone though.  His direction, his complete grasp of subject, is astonishing.  Honestly, this was one of the most pleasant surprises in recent memory for me.  I really thought that nothing Stone did would ever move me, let alone be one of my favorite films of any given year, but `JFK' is just too perfect not to completely fall for.

There has been a lot said about the truthfulness of the film, many attacking it for manipulating facts and expressing opinion, but honestly, isn't that what film is all about.  Stone is able here to give us his own interpretation of truth without ever forcing us to accept what we don't want to.  Nothing is presented in a way that conditions us.  Instead he delivers a solid thriller than exposes what `could' have taken place without ever telling us what `did' happen.

Quite honestly, this film is a total triumph.",1223856000,4,4882,4.546391752577319
97152,3,0790729733,"I've rated Stone's 'JFK' 3 stars not because of quality or accuracy but because this movie had a major impact on me.  In my first watching of this film, I detected at least one major, and I think deliberate, factual error.  One of the characters is handing a Carcano rifle as another character says words to the effect, ""The three shots took 7.8 seconds to fire.  Let's time it.""  He then picks up a stopwatch and clicks, ""Go.""  The other character, works the action [once], he works the action again [twice], he works the action a third time [three].  ""9.2 seconds,"" the one man emotes.  ""Impossible.""

Well, from reading over reports of the shooting I knew that this scenario was an untruth.  The timing was from the moment of the sound of the first shot--a couple of seconds after the first levering.

Fascinated by such an obvious error and, considering the fact that I am a pathologist and a shooter, I decided to redo the entire shooting scenario--personally--using the same type Carcano-Mannlicher rifle and the same type ammunition that the FBI claimed Oswald used.  I performed accuracy, rate of fire, bullet penetration, bullet deformation, head deflection and other studies.  By the time I was finished, I probably did as much ballistic work with the Kennedy shooting as anyone in the world, not excluding the FBI and CIA.

97153,4,0790729733,"I haven't viewed this movie since it came out, but after tonight's viewing, it still holds up as an engrossing and entertaining experience. Some of it maybe fiction and some not, but as for Oswald being the lone assassin, I just don't believe it. When you hear Mr. X describe his theory, it comes eerily close to  what out current President has done with Iraq.
I gave this edition only 4 stars because they really didn't need to fluff this one up by 17 minutes, a reason why it was left on the cutting room floor for theatrical release is quite apparent.
But do watch and decide for yourself...it is up to you and every American to decide and debate amongst yourselves.",1219536000,,669,4.483606557377049
97154,5,0790729733,"If you jettison the politics of this movie (and Stone's reputation as a muckracker), and simply look at JFK as a film, it's arguably Oliver Stone's best film and it is absolutely rivetting.  It's a masterpiece of cinemtography, editing, writing, and performances.  I've only seen the initial 189 minute theatrical version, and that film is my favorite Oliver Stone film.  Stone's scope of this project is incredible.  He not only makes an epic about the JFK assassination, but he makes it so fascinating and enthralling that you marvel as his talents as a filmmaker.  The cinematography here is astounding.  Robert Richardson shoots in 35mm, 8mm, and 16mm, color, black and white, tinted color, tinted black and white, and it all blends seamlessly.  The editing on this monster is also a marvel (it deservedly won an Oscar for editing).  The film has a ton of cuts (something in films I don't like), but Stone and his editors do wonders with it.  The performances deserve special mention as well.  Costner is very effective as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor who believed in the conspiracy of JFK's assassination.  Costner does a New Orleans accent very well, much better than his rather pathetic ""English"" one for Robin Hood:  Prince of Thieves.  There are numerous cameos in the film, but they don't feel like cameos.  Stone manages to make each actor/character unique and interesting.  It never feels like star spotting.  Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, and Ed Asner (as a right wing demogagoue, which is funny considering Asner is a very left wing liberal) are standouts in a magnificent cast.

When you watch this film, think of it as ""Stone's interpretation of the JFK assassination"".  There are numerous discrepancies here (such as Garrison meeting with Mr. X, played by Sutherland.  That never happened), but if you look at this film strictly as a film, it's remarkable and worthy of the accolades it has received over the years.  It's one of Oliver Stone's most memorable films, and a reminder of what a great director he can be when he's on.",1217289600,2,2100,4.945714285714286
97155,5,0790729733,"This controversial film by Oliver Stone on the JFK assasination has taken on a life all its own.  I recently saw it again on HD Net and I was drawn into it all over again by the brilliant performances, Stone's direction and the story itself.  Many people have criticized Stone for taking liberties with the story but this is not a documentary this is a drama!! Costner is brilliant in particular and his summation scene in court is belongs to his best work (also counting his role in Eastwood's ""A Perfect World"").  The aim of an artist is to make us question the truth and Stone has certainly succeeded at that.  Remember how many people felt the plot in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" grows eerily factual as time goes by!!  If you are repelled by the current events now unfolding before us--the Iraq war, the recession--do see this film again!!",1216598400,5,843,4.630872483221476
97156,1,0790729733,"The real shame of a movie like this is that so many viewers think it has some relationship to reality.

Don't get me wrong.  I happen to be one of those people who believes that the Warren Commission version of the Kennedy assassination is full of holes.  It's probable that Oswald was part of a large conspiracy, and that, in his own words, he was ""a patsy.""

That does not mean, however, that Oliver Stone's paranoid fantasies have any basis in reality.

Jim Garrison, the character played by Kevin Costner, is a real person.  He was really the DA of New Orleans.  He really indicted prominent homosexual businessman Clay Shaw for conspiracy to murder John F. Kennedy.  After a legal persecution that lasted for about two years, culminating in a trial that took weeks, a jury of sensible adults acquitted Clay Shaw of all the charges against him.  They took less than an hour to review the paltry evidence before deciding in Shaw's favor.

In the years since the trial ended, gay rights organizations in New Orleans have erected plaques in various parts of the city commemorating Shaw's contribution to the city's economic growth.  He was a victim, pure and simple.  There was almost no evidence against him at all.

Garrison's entire career as DA might be looked at as one long publicity stunt.  Right after he got elected, he indicted his predecessor for malfeasance, but the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.  He staged a big crackdown on crime in the French Quarter, but got almost no convictions.  When he accused a bunch of judges of conspiring against him, they charged him with criminal defamation and won.  He accused the state parole board of accepting bribes, but couldn't even get an indictment.  Garrison was great at holding press conferences, but not so great at proving his numerous accusations.

In my own mind, there are two ways to view Jim Garrison.  One is that he was a glory-seeking opportunist.  The other is that he was a glory-seeking nutcase.  It is a travesty that any movie should be made about Garrison that features him as a hero.  In fact, he was a paranoid manipulator of the legal system who victimized an innocent man.  In the hands of an actor better than Costner, with a script that didn't sugar-coat the facts, this story about the wild ravings of a glory hound could have been a great comedy.",1211932800,6,2340,4.706896551724138
97157,5,0790729733,"The brilliance in this film's production is that, by the artful interweaving of historical footage with the dramatic scenes, the finished product seems like an insightful, revisionist documentary. This is the film's strength and weakness, because it is primarily historical fiction in that Jim Garrison's point of view is presented as incontrovertible fact. I would caution those viewing the film, who may have no familiarity with the Kennedy assasination, that its plot not only presents Jim Garrison (of whom I'd never heard before seeing ""JFK"") in quite a different light than any Google search would reveal, but even distorts actual individuals with whom the real Garrison had dealings.

If one can detach oneself from the slanted version of the facts, it is a totally rivetting film. Kevin Costner heads a sterling cast - the acting is superb, and so believable that, despite the many familiar faces of fine actors whom one has seen in many roles, one nearly has the impression of having an inside look at 'real people' revealing secret dimensions to the evidence. For example, Ed Asner shows a shocking side to the attitudes towards the assasination which some in Dallas may have held (seeing the murderer as hero, where I'd always thought of Kennedy as an esteemed, well loved president), with a rough but convincing demeanour which is both deep and chilling. Joe Pesci gives a multi dimensional picture, both moving and puzzling, of the bizarre David Ferry.

I've rarely seen a lengthy film (and one in which I recognised significant innacuracy in relation to history) which so totally held my interest.",1204416000,3,1611,5.0754716981132075
97158,4,0790729733,"Oliver Stone, a brilliant liberal film director with a skewed anti-American political agenda, is mildly entertaining at best but usually offensive to reason, truth, and fact.  The old saying of 'never letting the facts get in the way of a good story' is certainly applicable here with the JFK film.  Costner is great (as usual), but one can't stop thinking that possibly the supporting cast (all leftists by design) have an agenda similar to that of Stone.  If you really want the facts and the factual history about the assasination of JFK, do some literary research on your own.  Start with Posner's 'Case Closed'.  After you've assimilated that, read the Warren Commision Report.  The bottom line is this:  Lee Oswald was the only shooter; he also killed Ofcr. Tippet; Oswald was a leftist, Lenninist, Marxist communist.  The Left simply refuses to believe or consider that one of their own (Oswald) could possibly have commited such a heinous crime.  It must have been a Right-wing conspiracy! (sound familiar?)
Anyway, as far as FICITIONAL entertainment goes, this film JFK is every bit as good as 'Wayne's World', 'Animal House', or 'Cabin Boy'.  Just don't confuse this film with the truth.",1201219200,2,1197,5.0
97159,3,0790729733,"Of the theatrical release, that is. It looks like a lot of it was from the windy, overwrought closing arguments Jim Garrison made in the Clay Shaw trial. They bordered on Shakesperean soliloquy, suppressed tears and all. I found myself waiting for a bailiff or court reporter or someone to come out and offer Garrison a box of kleenex. I can't help but notice that Costner outgrew this type of overacting in later efforts. Still, this cri-de-coeur struck me on reflection as possibly being as much of an opportunity to rant for the pretentiously iconoclastic Oliver Stone as it was Garrison's words. Elsewhere in the story, I found myself wondering at the way Garrison ""took his job home with him"" by constantly ruminating out loud about the case around his family, or was it just another use of the hackneyed movie cliche about the resentment of cop/ doctor/ whatever spouses at their spouses' tendency to be consumed or endangered by the job. I guess this film had to be this long to tell the story, but it also serves to remind us of who Michael Moore's ""daddy"" was.",1200700800,2,1069,4.691489361702128
97170,4,0790729733,"Once Donald Sutherland starts talking he goes on and on. And the first hour of the movie could use a little more action. But the cast is great and the main points are convincingly made. If you choose to believe Oswald acted alone, then the question is why? Just the incoherent act of a madman? Whatever. The bigger question is what happened to the age of assasination? It was over relatively quickly. Could it be because the people responsible finally got the kind of country they wanted? A country where no one gets elected without the backing of big corporate money and Washington acts at the behest of big corporate money or it doesn't act at all.",1197331200,2,650,4.564102564102564
97171,5,0790729733,"`Oliver Stone's best filmed historical novel sees Costner bringing the overly aggressive Jim Garrison into the Kennedy assassination plot as a major player, years after his sun had set  nationally. In a highly realistic tale, Garrison and wife Spacek weave an intriguing story of mafia-Cuban relations, which many today still believe to be true. Fortunately, the book ""Best Evidence"", followed by modern forensics seem to have cooled down the hysteria concerning gunman Oswald's need of an accomplice. Meanwhile, even the bit players including Sutherland talking in his eerie manner on a park bench, deliver top rate performances. One has to alert the public however that this film is historical fiction on the screen, not pure history. President Ford went to his grave believing that Oswald had acted alone in Dallas as a ""nut"",with absolutely no Cuban backing. It's a great movie, just be careful of your objectivity.",1196726400,2,919,5.2517006802721085
97172,2,0790729733,"During the speech that Jim Garisson, played by Kevin Costner, gives towards the end of this film, he quotes Adolf Hitler:  ""The greater the lie, the more people who will believe it.""  I guess he had a point.  Recent polls show that almost 80% of the American people believe the story Oliver Stone puts forth in ""JFK"".  This is a film that even major conspiracy theorists such as Mark Lane consider preposterous.  Lie after lie, half-truth after half-truth and omission after omission pepper this film throughout. I won't list them all because they are legion but a little digging will turn them up.  Consider , for one, that the document signed by LBJ in which ""lies the Vietnam war""  was actually a reiteration of JFK's removal of troops ordered in a previous document.  True story.  When JFK is shown saying that he believes that it is South Vietnam's war to win or lose, what is not shown is the rest of the interview where he says he believes it would be a mistake to leave Vietnam.  Minor stuff like that.

One interesting note,also.  During the aforementioned speech, Garrison says how JFK's body was removed from Dallas in a sinister way, spirited out on Air Force One where a rushed swearing-in takes place (complete with a photo of LBJ taking the oath with Jaqueline kennedy conveniently cropped out) and brought to DC where his brain can be lost and the cover-up perfected.  That would have to mean Bobby and Jackie Kennedy were involved, as they would have to be.  Mrs. Kennedy wanted out of Dallas quickly, with her husband.  Bobby involved even though he is eulogized later in the speech.  Is that really credible?  Let's not forget that Jackie had Kenny O'Donnell, personal friend and trusted aide of JFK, make sure JFK was removed from Dallas.  This is interesting as Kevin Costner played the sainted O'Donnell in the film ""Thirteen Days"".  This must have been a portrayal of O'Donnell before ""they"" got to him.

Well, I could go on, but I'm not convincing anyone on either side of the issue to switch sides, so I'll just end by saying that I gave it two stars because it is a compelling, well-made and acted film, even though I think it is a load of bunk.",1192233600,7,2171,4.618798955613577
97173,5,0790729733,"The assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 was one of the most shocking historical events in American history, much as Pearl Harbor and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were. Director Oliver Stone does an incredible job of re-creating the events and somber mood of that dark day and its aftermath by using real film footage shot by witnesses in Dealey Plaza, along with his own staged reenactments.

Whether you believe in an alleged vast (in my opinion, Stone's and Garrison's a bit too vast) conspiracy or Lee Harvey Oswald as the ""lone nut"" shooter, ""JFK"" should be seen for its historical content more than for its portrayal of real-life New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison's conspiracy-fueled investigation and resulting 1968-69 trial of Clay Shaw.

If nothing else, the film raises some interesting questions about who and what dark forces may have been behind the assassination, all the while keeping your attention with entertaining, fast-paced editing. While telling Jim Garrison's theory of the assassination, the film immerses the viewer into the socio-political mood of the late 1950's and early 60's-era dark and covert Mafia/CIA/FBI liaisons, presenting at times a documentary-style view of Cold War events, the U.S.'s escalating involvement in Vietnam, and its war on Castro's Cuba.

John William's soundtrack is beautiful and moving, and is successful in enhancing the mystery and intrigue of the film's content. The all-star cast with Kevin Costner in the lead role as Jim Garrison helps the characters appear familiar and likable, although I felt as if Stone tried too hard in getting all these familiar faces to appear in the movie because he figured no one would be interested in watching the 3-hour epic if he hadn't. Gary Oldman does an admirable job of emulating the stuttering and nervous Oswald, and Donald Sutherland utterly rivets you the screen with his soft-spoken stories of government black operations. Also noteworthy is Joe Pesci, who puts forth a psychopathic -- almost comedic -- portrayal of David Ferrie, one of the alleged conspirators. Sissy Spacek plays the troubled and frightened, but ultimately supportive wife of Garrison, and Tommy Lee Jones is in the role of the man on trial, Clay Shaw. Last but not least are the cameo-like appearances of huge stars Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, John Candy, and Kevin Bacon.

Watch the movie, maybe a few times. If nothing else you'll walk away more historically enlightened, maybe even asking some interesting questions about the assassination yourself. And, a Hollywood film that stirred a public outcry over alleged government secrecy surrounding the event, ultimately forcing it to release assassination records and form the 1992 Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) is in itself historically significant. This should make anyone want to see it.",1189641600,2,2865,5.262582056892779
97174,5,0790729733,"Look, it's a big old bucket full of lies, and one should know this before watching, (Or maybe after, I don't know) but like The Blair Witch Project, the scare comes from it's deception.  This COULDN'T be true, could it?  If it is, the world is a much darker place than I ever suspected.  It's frightening beyond belief.

So while I am a firm believer of the fact that Oswald and Ruby each committed their heinous acts alone, and while I'm somewhat worried about the impact this movie has had on my very suggestible generation, I can't deny that JFK is one of my favorite, most beloved films.  It's fascinating, scary, and very well constructed.  It's also full of terrific performances, although Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald is a bit overrated.  (Did he know anything about Oswald before he took the role?  He was inaccurate, putting it kindly.)

  The question is, does Oliver Stone have a responsibility to history or not?  Films like JFK and NIXON are a strong argument that all he's responsible for is his art, and as long as his art conveys his point of view this well, he's deserving of all the praise he's received.

  JFK is a vital, wonderful film.",1188950400,2,1161,4.567961165048544
97175,4,0790729733,"Conspiracy theories get a workout in Oliver Stone's JFK--he has hit upon every conceivable theory, every point and counterpoint to be made and has produced an absorbing, involving, and ultimately entertaining film that makes you think about which theory you believe is the likeliest. And he has a cast that brings every important character to life, even though the physical resemblances are not always there.

KEVIN COSTNER, for example, is excellent as the doggedly determined D.A. Jim Garrison (but looks nothing like the real Jim Garrison) who will leave no stone unturned in his effort to find the truth behind the killing of JFK--even if it means ignoring his wife and family while he pursues justice. Costner uses his Honest Abe image to give the sort of heartfelt, man-of-integrity intensity that James Stewart and Henry Fonda might have given in their day. He is made to seem like a towering figure of integrity in the script Stone has written from Jim Garrison's point of view--almost like Atticus Finch resurrected, especially in his closing courtroom speech. Was the real Jim Garrison really this noble?

As a note of irony, Stone has the real Jim Garrison playing Earl Warren and defending the Warren Commission Report with a straight face.

Other roles are played with equal validity by Tommy Lee Jones (as Clay Shaw), Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner (infuriating as Guy Bannister), and Joe Pesci as David Ferrie. Pesci is a bit over the top as David Ferrie (and gets on the nerves) but that's the way the role was written and directed.

But the most remarkable moments in the film are provided by the exchange of information between Kevin Costner and Donald Sutherland as the extent of the conspiracy is revealed to come from higher places in the government. Sutherland gives an imposing performance, quietly restrained but chilling as he delivers his insider information.

Special mention must go to Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. His face, voice and gestures are strikingly similar and blend well with actual footage of Oswald intermittently seen.

Altogether a very competent piece of filmmaking which fulfills its purpose by making the viewer think about what might actually have happened on that awful day in Dallas when the age of innocence officially ended in American politics. Whether it's the Mafia, Castro's Cubans, the FBI, the CIA or LBJ and the Pentagon (with the help of the Warren Commission), it's all there for you to sort out and ponder--perhaps until 2029 when some new suppressed evidence will eventually be released.",1186272000,2,2559,5.023584905660377

The multitude of characters and events make the film require many, many viewings. For this edition, Oliver Stone included tons of extra scenes and sequences. The additional footage of Donald Sutherland's sequence and the court room sequence add enlightening information and drama. Stone's commentary is also amazing. The documentary is wonderfully fascinating. This is Oliver Stone's ""Godfather"" and I truly think JFK is one of the best films ever made.",1184716800,4,585,5.369565217391305
97177,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone is known to stir up controversial subjects.  His most recent film, World Trade Center, came at a time when the memory of the 9/11 attacks were still painfully fresh in our nation's memory (they still are).  Unlike Stone's previous films, however, WTC did not point fingers at anyone (aka ""Loose Change"") and instead just focused on the human impact of the attacks and chronicled a few people's experiences throughout the event.

Stone's 1991 film ""JFK,"" definately points fingers.  Stone's active name calling and muckraking will polarize audiences with differing views on the events of November 22, 1963.  People who really believe that the assassination was carried out solely by Mr. Oswald will be incensed at the film's implication of our nation's own government, and those who discount the Magic Bullet theory will be pleased that Stone dares to consider the alternative.

Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the same writer of the autobiography from which the film is based (the film also bases itself from the book Crossfire by Jim Marrs).  Garrison is a lawyer who sets out to disprove the then-accepted Magic Bullet theory and other commonly accepted theories revolving around his assassination.  The Magic Bullet theory was an explanation issued from the Waren Commission explaining how Oswald miraculously fired 3 rounds in a matter of 5.6 seconds with two of the three shots accurately hitting their marks.  On top of that, these bullets waltzed around the cabin of the vehicle ripping  multiple entry wounds into Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally.  In addition to speculating the Magic Bullet Theory, Stone focuses on the other mysterious figures who stood to gain from Kennedy's death, and there were a lot of them.

There are a number of factors that contribute to the greatness of this film.  Aside from the political intrigue that may rouse negative emotions from its audience, the film expertly develops its characters into real, breathing, multi-dimensional characters.  On top of that, Stone's inherent storytelling ability shines through in this one.  The story may sound bland to someone who cares little of the subject, but Stone tells it in a way that will capture anyone's interest.  His fierce and emotional style does well to win the audience over.  Stone is a hit-or-miss director.  This one is definitely a hit.

JFK was unfortunately too radical for the hardline right wingers of his time.  He was a visionary leader who set the needed leadership examples for the presidents to come, and this thrilling account of his final moments with immortalize his memory for ages to come.",1181606400,5,2625,5.1030444964871196

97190,5,0790729733,"""JFK"" is an eye-opener. The Warren Commission had nothing more in mind than conveniently whitewashing Oswald and building a case against him as the so-called ""lone assassin,"" and ignored numerous credible witnesses who heard a shot or saw a puff of smoke coming from the knoll area to the front and right of where the fatal head-shot obviously came. Anyone who hasn't been brainwashed by this false gov't Report has to know that when a person is shot they don't fall toward the direction from where the bullet comes, defying the law of common sense and physics, but is obviously pushed away from the source of the shot... What's most criminal of all is that the Warren Report tried to make these decent citizen witnesses, who saw a shot from that direction, into non-persons, by excluding or changing their testimony, and to discredit them, some of whom died under conspicuously strange and violent circumstances, such as Lee Bowers, who saw a commotion behind the picket fence area after the president was shot. These citizens are heroes! for standing up to the pressure of the FBI and CIA who tried to intimidate them... Oliver Stone did a great service to this country with JFK - to make people think! - and people are continuing to wake up from the Big Lie, created to keep the public in the dark for reasons of ""national security"" - or to protect the culprits from prosecution... Here's where the original witness testimony can be found and readers make up their own mind whether these conveniently excluded witnesses are credible or not:

http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=9554

Focus on original witness testimony, pictures, and film and what happened on November 22, 1963 becomes painfully clear, as well as the people who gained the most from the assassination, some of whom are still in power, such as Arlen Specter, the original foister of the ridiculous Magic Bullet *Theory* that supposedly created seven wounds and looks like it was never shot through anything harder than cotton or water. That's right: the federal gov't thinks the average American citizen is stupid enough to take such a treasonous fabrication at face value. (Yes, the ""t"" word.) Let me add that the SCRIPT of JFK is fully documented and is available for concerned citizens to read. Please look deeper into this important matter, because a nation that is built upon a lie will not stand - and the truth has already been buried in the closet for more than 40 years. The clock is ticking and the country is in a mess from these covert lies. If you think that the murder of our president and cover-up no longer matters, please think again. The lack of an independent investigation into the events of 9/11 shows a similar disturbing pattern of lies and covert deceit. --a Concerned Citizen",1174176000,,2788,4.904661016949152
97191,5,0790729733,"An Oliver Stone classic, this movie is packed with information, three hours and 20 minutes.  Based on the investigation by Jim Garrison that ensued the death of John F. Kennedy, it portrays the lengths that one man was willing to go to bring justice to the American people.

You feel like you are brought back to that period of time when Americans still believed that our politicians were good people, and devoted to the freedoms that this country is based on.  The lighting, the quality of footage, the costumes, down to the very innocent yet nave nature of the American public.

Gradually as Garrison unravels the case, the situation gets ugly and then uglier, unveiling the true intention behind the death of JFK.  Garrison is confided in by many, telling him the facts of what they saw that day, evidence that was not only ignored but altered by the Warren Commission.  People begin to turn on him, including his wife.  This part of the story in particular demonstrates how difficult it was for Garrison, that even though his facts all lined up and the people knew about them, no one wanted to confront the horror of what this meant about our countries' leaders.

Stone illuminates details about the war industry, and the policies that JFK wanted to enforce.  It is disturbing even today in 2007, that our government offices were so heavily involved in making certain that our president that wanted to bring about change for the better was assassinated because of it.  It brings light to what is happening with our President Bush and his war today.",1172880000,4,1552,4.757462686567164

97193,4,0790729733,"Throughout its run of time,history,as we all know,has served both its very high points and its very low points. And,out of all of the very low points of history,one of those very low points continues to prove itself to be,by far,the assasination of John F. Kennedy. An assasination that left America in shame and grief with a lot of unanswered questions,people continue to ask unanswered questions about the JFK assasination--something that is resolved well throughout this film.

This film is focused around not only around the assasination of John F. Kennedy and the controversy that aroused from the assasination and tore America apart,but also the investigation that New Orleans,LA lawyer/judge Jim Garrison (portrayed brilliantly by Kevin Costner in this film)launched for the assasination. In this film,not only does director Oliver Stone do a brilliant job at showing the obcession that Jim Garrison had with the assasination and solving the assasination,as well as how Garrison's investigation of the assasination kept Garrison apart from his family and the effect that it had on Garrison's marriage to his wife,Liz Garrison (Sissy Spacek). This film portrays both sides of the investigation--the lawyers and politicians who helped Jim Garrison investigate the assasination and how they helped Garrison through his investigation of the assasination,as well as their theories/opinions on the investigation,and the criminals who were happy that the assasination had happened and showed their hatred of President Kennedy,while they were willing to do and say anything to make sure that the investigation was not solved and remained a cover-up. These scenes are as fascinating as they are(mostly)informative,with good information and good chemistry between the actors. For example,in scenes that feauture the character of Jim Garrison with a character like David Ferrie (Joe Pesci)or a character like Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon),good information on the assasination is brought into the conversations in the scene,while ideas about what could have caused the assasination are presented,as well. These scenes make this film as interesting as it is as a good film,with great chemistry in these scenes and great performances. These scenes are good additions in this movie alongside the other theories/facts from the assasination (what lead to Lee Harvey Oswald commiting the assasination,the problems that Jack Ruby's assasination of Oswald caused for the case and the things that happened to Ruby's life out of it,among others)which are fit into this film quite well and do a good job at carrying this film on until its very end,when you are given a depiction of the trial that Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones)faced and not only what got Shaw on trial,but also how Jim Garrison was able to answer some of the unanswered questions about the JFK assasination,and,of course,who murdered Kennedy and why Kennedy was murdered (with all of this being said,it is worth noting that President Lyndon B. Johnson's Warren Commision stated that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman and that the assasination was not part of a conspiracy,but that several people question the accuracy and honesty of that statement to this very day).

Overall,an interesting and good film that does a great job at answering the unanswered questions of the John F. Kennedy assasination,and provides a possible theory with the issues and questions of who was involved with the assasination and why the assasination was committed. This film is VERY long (three hours--just a word of warning to those of you who do NOT like sitting through long movies),but is well lead and followed by Oliver Stone to make itself worth its running time. Kevin Costner is brilliant as Jim Garrison and allows viewers to take a walk through the mind of Mr. Garrison himself with Costner's portayal as Garrison,which shows who Garrison was as a person and how his personality was a large part of the assasination,with a good cast of supporting actors (Gary Oldman,John Candy,Brian-Doyle Murray,among several others) who bring richly executed performances to the screen and help the film come to life,with a good understanding of their character brought into their performance,at the same time. If you are a fan of history and have always wanted to learn more about the John F. Kenendy assasination,""JFK"" is the place to be,while this DVD has loads of great bonus feautures on it,as well.",1169337600,4,4431,5.283687943262412

I admit, the film inspired me to do some research on the Kennedy assassination, but all I found was that the film was one lie after another after another.  It really spooked me until I found out that it was almost completely created out of whole-cloth.  If you really want to watch it, just take it as a piece of fiction, that way it won't be such a let-down when you find out more about the topic later.

97197,5,0790729733,"Director Oliver Stone's perhaps most ambitious and controversial work is laden with an all-star cast, including Kevin Costner, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, Jack Lemon, Ed Asner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Michael Rooker, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland and Walter Matthau among others. Stone seemingly makes a big deal of this film, and the film captures a grandiose nature intended for such a big moment in American history. Like it or hate it, and there are many reviewers on both sides of this fence, this film is engrossing, fascinating, and captivating in terms of its production. The director doesn't seemingly leave any rock unturned without some type of explanation into what happened before, during and after the assassination of JFK. While many may disagree with the theories depicted in the film, the larger question that the film seemingly asks about not only JFK, but America is ""What if?"" What if things that were presented after the assassination weren't as crystal clear as we had thought they were? JFK certainly brings to the forefront an important day in American history, and questions the nature of what is real and what is illusion, and, for these reasons, I feel as though this is a film that everyone should see.

Kevin Costner's portrayal of Jim Garrison is outstanding, and he illustrates the very essence of a man who questions why Kennedy died that day in Dallas. While his investigation is momentous in its own right, it also is not a popular one in the public eye. After the assassination, he takes apart piece by piece not only those who might have been present or implicated in some way to that event, but reconstructs the entire time frame beforehand leading up to the assassination. He only manages to make some head way when he begins to ""ruffle some feathers"", such as an investigation into the CIA, FBI and even those in Congress. He also is able to reconstruct a time table for the whereabouts of Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). Garrison works tirelessly and laboriously to the point where it not only affects the support of those around him, but also his family life. As the man obsessed with discovering the truth, Garrison puts it best when talking with reporters, ""Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.""

Garrison is able to get to question some key figures in this case, such as Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), David Ferry (Kevin Bacon), and a man who goes by the name ""X"" (Donald Sutherland). Garrison asserts that things aren't as clear as they should be, and that his staff needs to think on a different level if they want evidence to build this case. Motives for why others would have wanted to kill JFK are questioned, and eventually he is able to get a case against Clay Shaw as being an accessory to the president's murder.

The film seemingly questions many different theories about what could have actually happened that day. For instance, Garrison questions over how 3 shots could have been fired in 6 seconds. He also excavates the shoddy job of investigation immediately after the president was killed. Oswald's role in the crime is debated, whether he could have been a decoy or fall guy for someone else, and Garrison questions some of the testimonies of the witnesses immediately following the shooting, namely Oswald's wife.

The film also depicts the violent and tumultuous times that were the 1960s, and equates them with JFK's assassination. Not only was JFK targeted, but other leaders such as Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King were killed during this era. The chaos and disorder and ultimate disbelief that were experienced by Americans during this time period are a statement as to how our outlooks can change in a relatively brief time when facing difficulties and painful moments.

Oliver Stone's film, as daring and controversial as it is, is quite an engrossing and powerful epic. The larger than life quality of the film is only minimized by the significant event it is investigating, and losing our president on that day was certainly a shocking tragedy to Americans. JFK is one of those rare movies that should be seen by everyone, whether you agree with its theories or not.",1167696000,3,4167,4.863380281690141

Kevin Costner is Jim Garrison,a district attorney who represents Lee Harvey Oswald who was accused of Kennedy's November 22,1963 assassination in Dallas. Sissy Spacek is Jim's wife. This film also features special appearances by Kevin Bacon and the late John Candy. Unlike Kennedy,then-Texas governor(now deceased) John B. Connolly survived the shooting although he was wounded. I dedicate this film to the memory of Kennedy and the surviving members of his family. Stone should make epics about the lives and post-presidency deaths of Lyndon B. Johnson,Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. I'm sure Nixon and Reagan saw this film(they were both alive in 1991 when this film was theatrically released).

What I will say is that there is alot of info in this movie that you will probably never hear in a history class and for good reason.  It simply makes certain factions of our government look downright evil. Oliver Stone may have taken some liberties with the facts(most of hollywood does), but just like he said in an interview once, if even some of what's portrayed in the movie is true, it would be proof that a conspiracy actually existed and should be a huge wake up call to the nation.  Any clear thinking individual (whether right or left) who sees this movie, should walk away deeply disturbed by the damning accusations that are made towards our government.  If you believe (as I do) that shadowy figures in our intelligence agencies plotted and carried out the assasination of one of the greatest presidents we ever had, you will never again look at your country the same way nor blindly trust your government again.

As for the movie, I think it would bring people into reading more deeply into JFK...possibly of the point of disregarding the movie over time after other facts surface in one's search.  Heck, we've all seen movies that started our interests in something that after the facts were reviewed that the movie was half-bogus, but still a fun watch anyway.  It is a fascinating topic and will always be just like Pearl Harbor, 911, Iran Contra and many other things.  The questions are almost always much more interesting than the answers.

97223,1,0790729733,"As someone who was born over twenty years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, my link to this event is more historical than emotional. This is important, for I think it helps me avoid the biases and passionate assumptions that plague so many of my predecessors in the Baby Boomer generation. Everyone alive at that time remembers where they were on the day Kennedy was killed, and since the man represented so many hopes, it is of little wonder that so much emotion and conspiratorial thinking cloud this issue. Some of it is unintended; Oliver Stone's film seems to intentionally mislead.

The fact is that everyone from Norman Mailer to Myth Busters has weighed in on the possibility that Oswald did not act alone, or did not shoot the president, or a patsy in the wrong place at the wrong time. Evidence and common sense have forced sources as disparate as these to one conclusion: Oswald had the motive, had the ability, had the opportunity, and was essentially found at the scene of the crime. To test the conspiracy theories, the Discovery Channel recreated the assassination. They gave a rifleman the same gun that Oswald used to shoot a watermelon in a car from the same distance and angle. The rifleman succeeded, and unless you think the CIA 'got' to the Discovery Channel, there is no reason not that Oswald could not have done the same. Oliver Stone should really watch that episode of Myth Busters. It takes apart the popular beliefs that Oswald could not have shot JFK. Mock the source all you want; you cannot mock their findings. Watch for yourself.

In my mind, there is a far simpler explanation for all these conspiracy theories that surround JFK and Lee Oswald. People - and leftists like Oliver Stone - simply cannot believe that a man of the left (JFK) was killed by another man of the left (communist-sympathizer Oswald). It is so much prettier to hang the crime on the cliched villains of the liberal drama: the evil right-wing military, 'sell-outs' like LBJ, and 'you-can't-handle-the-truth' g-men. When you also realize that Oliver Stone is an avowed communist and visits Fidel Castro on widely-publicized trips, the situation becomes even clearer. Stone can not afford to believe in the truth of JFK because to do so would besmirch his pet social theory. Then again, that is often the Baby Boomer way. Oliver Stone has really slowed down human progress here by his willful distortions of a complicated subject. Don't reward that.",1147824000,28,2464,4.8364928909952605
97224,5,0790729733,"I hate Oliver Stone and sometimes it's for odd reasons. Like this movie. This is a great movie, I loved it. But it makes me hate Stone nonetheless. A few months ago there was a special on the History Channel about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In it, they used a computer to determine just who killed Kennedy. After watching that program I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin, the guy had actually spoke with people about how he wanted to feel important and the only way to do that was to kill a National Leader. This guy was an attention seeker. Reading a little bit into Jim Garrison, I found people who have stated that Garrison was a cruel man who bribed, drugged, and threatened people in order to get them to admit there was a conspiracy to kill JFK. This movie makes Garrison into a good guy and presents a lot of interesting theories about Kennedy's death. Theories that I haven't heard in anything else as being untrue, so I'm left to completely reverse my thinking on who killed Kennedy. But, anyway, I'll start talking about the movie. Kevin Costner, in an Oscar worthy performance, plays Jim Garrison. Garrison is a D.A. in New Orleans, who like all Americans, was shocked the day JFK was assassinated. Garrison watches the story unfold on television. Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman, who's performance is massively underrated. He should've got an Oscar nomination)

is captured and then killed by a man named Jack Ruby, who was rumored to have connections with the mob. While the rest of America accepts this as what has happened, Garrison sees something wrong and launches an investigation into the death of JFK. Throughout his search, he meets people like David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon), and X (Donald Sutherland) who all agree that there was a conspiracy and that a man named Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) was in on it. I don't want to give away the ending, but you probably know what happened with the Shaw case. Anyway,

most of the people Garrison and his team interview wind up dead or backing out of what they said...Which ends up making this film all the more interesting. I do want to warn anyone who watches this movie to not accept all of this as fact. I don't know how much of this is true, although everything is pretty damn elaborate; but Oliver Stone has always had a reputation for ""creative licenseing"". Look at movies like Nixon, The Doors, & Alexander to see that. Nixon suggested that Richard Nixon knew something about the assassination of JFK. The Doors suggested that Jim Morrison was a blabbering idiot with an indian frequently coming in and out of his body. Oh, and then Alexader suggests that Alexander the Great was a homosexual who did not die in battle but at a later date. Stuff like that makes it hard for me to accept anything in this film. But the entertainment value here is enough to suggest watching it. It's truly a good movie that should not be passed up.

All the performances are great, the writing is great, and even the directing is great; Even though Stone still weaves in and out of black & white to color.

But, as I said, I think people should see this movie but don't make your decision on what really happened that day based solely on the film.

97225,5,0790729733,"Concerning the assassination of President Kennedy, I think it's important to keep in mind the colorful stir created by Oliver Stone's film, JFK. Whether from journalistic diatribe or vitriolic accusations of fraud by certain politicians, it's obvious Mr. Stone hit a sensitive nerve. So many conspiracy theories have been put forth. These groups and the hard-liners defending the Warren Commission's final report seem to actually be converging; the final combination will put the matter to rest. Or will it? Hopefully, this will happen before the documents are released in 2017 or 2029, or whatever date is now in vogue, if for nothing else, to allay the continued torment of American people. But the documents do not hold the answer; or at least, I believe it is unlikely.

From the X-Files, I think we can now say that, ""the truth is out there"". But what most people don't seem to realize, is that ""The Truth,"" is not written down in any kind report or manuscript. I am sure there are names, dates, addresses, points of contact, and associations between persons involved in the conspiracy, but many of these men are dead now and cannot be brought to trial. No one except New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison has tried anyone concerning the JFK assassination. This is why his case against business magnet Claw Shaw is so important. Not that Shaw might have been involved in the assassination somehow, but that the case brought attention to the possibility of conspiracy.

People waiting for the day when we will see irrefutable evidence for assassination conspiracy made public, are, I believe, misled. That day will probably never come. One can imagine how the decision to murder President Kennedy was concocted in someone's hunting cabin in the middle of nowhere, and surely was made by only a few, very influential men. These are men who have been dictating American policy since the economic successes of World War II. I think they call it ""The Military-Industrial Complex"", or sometimes, ""The Power-Elite"". Certainly, wars had been alive and well between corporations in America for many years prior to World War II. But the vying and maneuvering by industrial giants really got under way during the war, and after. Leaning toward the notion of ""Social Darwinism"", we see that the bounty goes to those who are most aggressive and controlling...amid liberal contrivances of political ideology...it's still ""survival of the fittest"", according to many moguls.

Of paramount importance is understanding that JFK had thousands of ardent enemies, some with formidable power and the means to carry out the murder. Imagine, if you will, in that hypothetical lonely cabin in the woods, the decision was made for a coup d'etat, and on November 22, 1963, in the course of about 8 seconds on a sunny day in Dallas, Texas, our government was realigned. Someone felt that John F. Kennedy was not only a threat to national security, but also a threat to continued economic growth. War might be ""hell"" for some, but for others, war is a way to make an enormous amount of money. I suppose I do not need to say that ""money is power"". The men who made this decision probably feel that they have been correct so far, but the new ""American Empire"" is becoming strained, and ultimately it might collapse, depending upon decisions made by the Bush Administration. But the real issue that came to bear upon the decision to murder JFK probably had more to do with Kennedy's insistence of diminishing troop presence in Vietnam than anything else. This is true even if a US military presence existed only in an advisory capacity. It is interesting to note that there were more bombs dropped on North Vietnam than all the bombs dropped during World War II, but the war industry requires soldiers, as well. Who had the most to lose from Kennedy's Vietnam warfare policy, which proclaimed the president's wishes for a large reduction in US presence throughout 1964, and almost all advisory troops being removed by the end of 1965? Obviously, the individuals who make money by funding warfare had the most to lose. Still, there were many discrepancies and contradictions in President Kennedy's Vietnam policy. Many were unsure exactly where he stood, and a few wondered if the president himself knew where he was supposed to stand. In the interim, a machination was launched by the Power-Elite to remove John Kennedy from office. But here again, I think it unlikely that these men acted alone. They simply couldn't. They had to have ruthless, nameless, stateless, and faceless individuals to pull off the assassination. In a nutshell...enter Organized Crime.

I still believe that the Mafia made it happen, but the decision was one of collective, conscious agreement between parties participating in the assassination. The CIA could not risk the chance of a government agent being implicated. Ironically, Lee Harvey Oswald had major connections with the CIA (he was known as an ""asset"" to intelligence officials). But Lee Oswald was considered a double-agent, in that, he was a deep undercover counter-intelligence operative, and was purportedly working in a systematic intelligence operation engendered to attract KGB spies toward himself and his wife. Would a true defector who lived in the USSR for an extended period be allowed to come back to the United States and work in a specialty photographic studio that developed and analyzed U-2 spy plane images? Again, he was there to attract Soviet agents. He was under orders to present contradictory personalities, sometimes being pro-Cuban, and sometimes being anti-Cuban. But Lee Oswald was never a communist. That was his cover. The intelligence community wanted him to appear as two different individuals. He most likely had several designations within the intelligence community, but one final mark became imprinted on his forehead: EXPENDABLE.

The Mafia (primarily Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante) knew of the Kennedy brothers' plan to invade Cuba and kill Castro in December, 1963, and they used this as a way to keep the government from putting the blame on them. Through their connections in New Orleans with ex-FBI agent Guy Bannister and CIA agents, David Ferrie (Carlos Marcello's personal pilot) and Clay Shaw, they also knew of Oswald and his intelligence orders. Interestingly, the shadow government's complicity in the matter was orchestrated by individuals who were also expendable...characters with much to hide, and many reasons to hold to their Mafia loyalties. Another misconception many people have is that Jack Ruby's murder of Oswald was an impulsive act. The truth is that this lowly figure in the underworld (a drug and gun-runner for Trafficante with ties to Cuba) was also expendable, and more so, since he was suicidal. He wanted to be known for something, maybe loved for something more, but his legacy is now shrouded in the darkest recesses of American history. Jack Ruby was the ""other"" patsy in Dallas, but contrary to Oswald, he was aware of his duty. He also knew that the failure to carry out his duty to his ""mob"" bosses would place himself and his siblings in grave danger. Jack Ruby was always concerned with the welfare of his family. While in prison, Ruby became paranoid, and truly began going insane, but on several occasions intimated to his involvement in a ""conspiracy"", and he begged Earl Warren to allow him to go to Washington to offer testimony involving the Kennedy assassination. One other individual who might have known ""too much"" was officer Tippit, supposedly gunned down by Oswald, however, the assertion that Oswald was involved in this crime is now overwhelmingly contested.

To simply blame the killing on the so-called ""Power-Elite"" or the Mafia is incomplete. In my opinion, it's impossible for either group to have acted alone. They needed each other. This is how I think it happened:  When the Power Elite decided that Kennedy had to be removed, they began asking, ""how?"" Since the Mafia had already done assassinations for the CIA, they would be the logical choice; it was well known that the Mob brotherhood (Marcello, Trafficante, Giancana, Rosselli, Hoffa, et. al.) hated the Kennedy brothers, and they were given free rein to carry out the deed. But the Godfathers could not use professional assassins from the US...at least not those who were known by citizenship. They had to have men outside the circle. This is why Trafficante utilized his connections with the Marseilles Mafia (French Connection heroin cartel originally based in Havana); it eliminated any connection to the US Mafia (or CIA) with the killing, just in case anything terribly wrong occurred during the assassination attempt. These professional ""killers"" floated effortlessly around the world with false passports and bogus identities under the auspices of their drug-trade leaders, and the secret, even if shameless, blessings of the CIA men who were involved. Many assassinations worldwide have been undertaken and carried out by these faceless killers. And this is still going on today...not a pleasant thought. Lee Oswald was necessary to cover the ""investigation"" long enough for the true killers to make their escape, and to lend support for Lyndon Johnson's and J. Edgar Hoover's assessment of the crime. The conspiracy trickled from the Power-Elite through the middle-men, and finally to the nefarious individuals who made their living by smuggling drugs and murdering people.

From an alternative viewpoint, it's important to understand that assassination is an important regulator of government bodies worldwide. Hundreds if not thousands of political elites and their affiliates were executed during the 20th Century, not to mention those murdered in the USSR and Germany. How many people did Stalin murder? It is a known fact that he killed upwards of 30 million people, but many thousands of top political adversaries were rubbed out in the name of Stalin's brand of communism. Hitler came to power by the same means. It is important to remember the political ideology belonging to Hitler and Mussolini; it was called Fascism, and yes, it utilized assassination as it's main impetus for change.

Some researchers speculate that the CIA had something to do with the murder of South Vietnam's Ngo Dinh Diem in Saigon on November 1, 1963, but that later, through an illegal alteration of certain documents, it might be investigated and found that the JFK administration had the Vietnamese leader murdered. In truth, the Kennedy administration had planned to fly Diem and his family out of Vietnam to Europe, but this failed and the coup became history. What other documents have been forged in order to implicate John F. Kennedy's malfeasance in both domestic and foreign affairs? This is why, for the CIA to make certain documents available for the public's scrutiny, may or may not be helpful in solving the mystery of the JFK assassination. This is because if ""Top Secret"" documents are not redacted to the point of being unreadable, then they can certainly be altered to change history. In reality, many CIA and intelligence documents probably have been altered to ""create history"" to the tune of the Power-Elites' selective agenda. Does this agenda reflect the attitudes and values of most Americans? The sad truth is that most Americans are clueless toward the inner workings of their government.

New evidence suggests that the Kennedy's were secretly carrying out a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro in December, 1963, and the fact that they were doing this outside the auspices of the ""Power-Elite"", and the major branch of the CIA and the joint chiefs, again lends credence to the possibility that someone (or group of individuals) decided JFK was a true security risk, since this deeply covered invasion might have easily propelled the USA into a nuclear conflict with Cuba and the USSR. Under the rules of the disarmament of Cuba (Cuban Missile Crisis), agreed to by Kennedy and Khrushchev in October, 1962, all thermonuclear, intermediate range ballistic missiles were to be removed from Castro's island, and the USA was to be allowed an opportunity for weapons inspections. These inspections never came into being, and for this reason, John and Bobby Kennedy continued with their plans to assassinate Cuba's leader. The Mafia was not included in this plan, but because of the mob's intimate connections with individuals within the CIA, they became aware of the secret plan, and used it to pull off their ultimate intended ""hit"". The Kennedy brothers had tirelessly pursued the Mafia dons and godfathers for years, but after John Kennedy's murder, most of Bobby Kennedy's aims ceased. The mobsters were free again. Interesting.

I believe that the conspiracy, in the end, will be shown to be extremely complex. Intelligence officials became aware of the possibility of assassination attempts on the president while he was campaigning in Chicago and especially in Tampa, Florida, but for some unknown reason presidential security was drastically reduced for the Dallas motorcade. Some secret service personnel were even told to ""stand down"", as another group would assume their roles. However, that other group of security personnel was not present on November 22. It is unlikely that Lyndon Johnson and/or J. Edgar Hoover were instruments for decision on the murder of JFK, but the fact that security for the president on that day in Dallas had been significantly reduced, and in some areas eliminated, points to the notion of high-level government involvement. If Hoover had caught wind of an impending assassination in Dallas, then here is where a seriously sinister aspect of the conspiracy kicked into gear. Reducing security simply allowed the murder that would not have otherwise been carried out. Are you with me? With JFK eliminated, Hoover once again had control of the FBI, and Lyndon Johnson became president. Four days after Kennedy's death, LBJ signed the authorization to escalate US activities in Vietnam, and nine months later the ""Gulf of Tonkin Resolution"" was passed by Congress. Although involved with Indochina's affairs since September, 1945...it was in August 1964 that the United States' Vietnam war began in earnest with operation ""Flaming Dirt"", a serious air strike against targets in North Vietnam. In another seven months, General Westmoreland's Marines were deployed in force to Da Nang (March 8, 1965). And, at this time, the CIA's role as the operational command in Vietnam was being shared with the military. Soon there would be over 500,000 American troops in-country, in Vietnam and surrounding regions, and ""before that `no-win' conflict would end, more than $220 billion would be poured into the coffers of the war makers""

[ 1996, Prouty, L. Fletcher; JFK, The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy ]

But who was at the top of the pyramid, and why was John F. Kennedy murdered? That's the big one...we will probably never know. The only question left to all Americans to ponder is whether or not the assassination of JFK ultimately was advantageous or detrimental to America. How can we ever really know this truth? Maybe the truth lies within the hearts and minds of the people, and that is where it should stay. The Warren Commission stated that Lee Oswald was the lone ""nut"" assassin of president Kennedy. Here in lies the crux of the matter vis-a-vis the sentiment of the American public before conspiracy became a household word. Any other truth is simply too terrible to consider. But we must keep open minds that do consider the possibilities, and no matter how dark the forces, they must be confronted publicly with determination and courage. America belongs to us, the people, and so do our leaders.

Oliver Stone's movie, JFK, will help to bring some of these issues to light. Recommended.",1146096000,8,15861,5.100076982294072
97226,4,0790729733,"MY IMPRESSION - - INCREDIBLY WELL DONE DRAMATIZATION: BUT WHERE EXACTLY IS THE TRUTH?

To evaluate this film fairly is like evaluating the book ""State of Fear"". If one agrees with the Author/Director's conclusions, the film or book is great. If not, it is garbage or worse, in one's opinion. I have chosen to treat both of these as prime examples of fictionalization. In that light, this film is terrific entertainment and does indeed get people thinking and politicians worrying.

A FICTIONALIZED INTERPRETATION OF THE FACTS - -

Of course, it is a shame that everything in the book is not pure fact. Watching this film, one becomes certain that Clay Shaw, played by Tommy Lee Jones in an Oscar-winning role, was certainly guilty as sin. After all, we all but saw him commit the crime. Jim Garrison played deftly by Kevin Costner proves every point including Clay Shaw's perjury as we see the answers to the questions Garrison is asking in flashback form which is followed by Shaw telling yet another lie. The same style is used with John Candy's character Dean Andrews answering the question, ""Did you ever met Clay Shaw?"", with, ""I never met the dude"", while he asks for more cashews from Shaw in a simultaneous flashback. Oliver Stone uses this flashback device as a sort of lie detector for the viewers' benefit and entertainment throughout the film to reinforce his point. The benefit is the immediate comprehension of the point that Stone wants to make, but the entertainment value is the more lasting one. In essence, watching these scenes over and over is just as comedic each time but as one gets familiar with the facts [as they are being presented], one can both see the flaws in the argument and be drawn to collecting the facts oneself from more objective sources. If only Stone had been a little more objective with his arguments/facts, this film would have been a great gift to humankind instead of just great entertainment for film fans/JFK conspiracy theorists.

ABOUT THE 2 DISK DVD SPECIAL EDITION:

There are scenes in this DVD that are not on the VHS or theatrical releases. These additions make much of the rapid-fire quasi-facts presented during the Garrison explanations at trial make more sense. Widescreen helps too, as this ensemble cast does not quite fit in full frame in some sequences.

FEATURES: THIS DIRECTOR'S CUT 2-DISK SET IS WORTH THE DIFFERENCE!

Deleted scenes are usually best left deleted. This film is no exception as they really slow things down, but they do add understanding to the heart of the film's premise. There is also a thought-provoking feature which details what the Congress has done regarding looking into this matter (JFK's assassination) after this film's release.

This is by no means the last word on the assassination of JFK or the definitive word.

97227,1,0790729733,"JFK, the worst of Oliver Stone, begins with General Eisenhower's 1961 warning to America about the complex miscegnation of the military & industry.  Eisenhower's warning, which has totemic or iconic status on the Left because it seemed to presage a half-vast right-wing conspiracy, was apparently abbreviated for public consumption.  According to the leftist New York Review of Books, the old general intended to denounce an unholy alliance of militarism, industry, and Congressional Democrats who berated Ike for Cold War bomber gaps and missile gaps that he knew didn't exist.  One of the Democrats demanding more billions of dollars for useless armaments against the USSR was Senator John Kennedy, who almost certainly knew the gaps, if they existed, were in our favor, not theirs.

Oliver Stone and his JFK fantasy are oblivous to truth and nuance;  they are deadly to history.  Even as dystopian fantasy, letting a thousand rotten fleurs du mal of fever-swamp conspiracy wilt & die in the light of day, Stone's JFK doesn't work.  That's mostly because Costner doesn't work as Garrison, Garrison doesn't work as Warren, & Warren probably got it right the first time:  the best evidence & our best guess is that the filthy little communist (Jackie's words) did it with the Mannlicher-Carcano in the Depository.

Stone emptied the asylum on this one.  He built his bogus bs on Jim Marrs (sane, but a mercenary for the unhinged), Prouty, & the jolly green giant who easily ran over the Big Easy until a sober jury took about one hour to laugh him out of court.  Jim Garrison was an American monster.  He got headline news in the most fevered swamps (Ramparts Magazine) of the Left at a time when the Left's fevers were almost terminal.  He destroyed a good man, Clay Shaw, in a judicial conspiracy of emotional blackmail & emotional extortion.  Emotional rescue for New Orleans came only when Garrison took his bad case to court where the case collapsed, like Shaw, for whom rescue came too late.

Stone should be ashamed of himself, but he's shameless, smirking all the way to his large-cap portfolio.  If he was going to make an Ed-Wood horror show, he should at least have hired a better man to play the lead, but hey, people bought their tickets & bought his septic-cesspool posturing anyway.  Then they went to see Stone's Natural Born Killers, maybe even worse than Stone's JFK.  Go, as they say, figure.",1143331200,15,2411,4.896551724137931

I have seen this movie a few times and still to this day I beleive that there was a coverup. I also have the same questions reguarding how one man could have shot the rifle that day. I also beleive in the ""One Miracle Bullet"" theory that there had to be more than one person and or persons doing the shooting. One bullet could not have possible done the damage they say it did.

Too many questions and not enough answers and I in my lifetime will not be able to find out exactly all the details of what could have happened that day. Like so many others I think that Oswald was used as a pawn. I also beleive it was made too easy for one gun man to come down to the jail when Oswald was being moved and was able to shoot him without one person stopping the event. All of which was caught on camera for the nation to see.

The movie brings up so many issues of events that took place that day and too many minor details that could have saved his life had they been implamented especially after all the warnings being told before he even made the trip to Dallas.

  Now that almost if not all of the people involved in this are dead I see no reason why the documents can not be made public. His daughter had to be way too young to remember that day as his son said he never really rememberred his father. True there are still family members of the Kennedy's alive but I am sure that they as well would want to know all that was found that day. To know the truth is what the Nation really wants to know.

97247,5,0790729733,"It was November 22, 1963, the day US president John F. Kennedy was assassinated marking one of the most overwhelmingly saddening and pivotal events in American history. A man by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald was caught the very same day and charged with the murder of the president. The next day, Oswald was assassinated by former FBI agent Jack Ruby as he was leaving the facility he was being held in. The investigation has since frozen, and it was Oswald's name that has been linked to that of the president as the lone gunman who killed him.

Less than 30 years later, controversial American filmmaker Oliver Stone reopened the JFK assassination files with this excellent movie that studies the assassination, and comes up with theories revolving around Oswald, and a plot to kill Kennedy that involved the CIA, FBI, Cuban exiles, Lyndon B. Johnson and many others. Now remember, it's all a matter of theory. But the theories presented in JFK are eye opening. How could Oswald shoot no less than 5 bullets in a mtter of 8 seconds and get the president from at least 3 different angles? (The magic bullet theory). What about the people who said that they heard shots coming from the picket fence right in front of the motorcade as it was passing by?

JFK is an interesting movie with a star studded cast including Kevin Costner as District Attorney Jim Garrison, who takes us along on an inspiring investigation spree of who did what, and for what reasons, Sissy Spacek as his impatient wife, Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw Bertrand, the man Garrison is trying to pin, Gary Oldman who does a brilliant job as Oswald, and many others including Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Brian Doyle-Murray, Donald Sutherland, and Michael Rooker.

One of the best movies ever made!

97248,2,0790729733,"In his landmark 1991 film about the assassination of President Kennedy -- ""JFK"" -- Oliver Stone has just about everybody east of the Rocky Mountains involved in one way or another in the elaborate ""plot"" to assassinate John Kennedy. This film is a veritable ""Melting Pot of Plots"".

A logical question to ask would be: How could so many different people, agencies, and organizations possibly ALL be involved in such a massive assassination plot and never have anybody from any of these agencies leak any information? Such widespread theorizing is utter nonsense, IMO. I guess Mr. Stone just wanted to touch every possible base, and throw in the kitchen sink, to boot. :-)

There's a point in the film which has Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his staff, while eating dinner in a restaurant, coming up with conspiracy theories seemingly out of thin air and off the tops of their heads. Mr. Garrison seems to be taking assassin Lee Harvey Oswald at his word when Oswald shouted ""I'm just a patsy!"" to the waiting press in the Dallas Police Department hallways. Of course, just exactly WHY this known liar (Oswald) -- who told one falsehood after another to both the police and the anxious press at the police station -- would suddenly be looked upon as a TRUTHFUL person by the conspiracy theorists, who believe he was telling the truth when he uttered his famous ""Patsy"" declaration after his arrest, is a mystery to me. Most curious indeed.

""JFK"", which premiered in U.S. movie theaters on December 20th, 1991, might very well make some people think twice about what really happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. But when weighed against all the evidence in the case, you soon begin to realize that the film is designed ONLY to make you think like Oliver Stone WANTS you to think.

And I would also ask those conspiracy theorists who take this movie to heart to consider the rationale and logic that would have been exhibited by any ""plotters"" who were attempting to ""frame"" their lone ""Patsy"" PRIOR to the assassination. Because placing your faith in the boobs who supposedly cooked up the kind of PRE-assassination ""Let's-Frame-Oswald"" plot that is proposed by Mr. Stone in this film is akin to drawing to an 'Inside Straight'! I'd sooner believe the sun will rise in the west tomorrow.

In other words -- In order to accept the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was the ""Patsy"" he said he was, and in order to buy into Oliver Stone's 3-Gunmen, 6-Shot ""Triangulation of Crossfire"" conspiracy theory that is the central ""shooting plot"" as depicted in this motion picture, anyone who accepts this film's proposed shooting scenario as ""fact"" MUST, therefore, also be of the opinion that these ""conspirators""/""plotters"" had no hesitation whatsoever to green-light and proceed full-tilt with a ""Patsy"" plan that would involve the POTENTIAL final results of having the one and only target (John F. Kennedy) being hit with UP TO SIX SEPARATE BULLETS fired from the guns of THREE different snipers (one of which was firing from the front, the exact OPPOSITE direction from where the ONE ""Patsy"" was supposedly firing in the Texas School Book Depository Building, which was located to the REAR of the President's car).

Even in a 'perfect conspiracy world', how in the heck could these covert ""plotters"" possibly have thought (on November 21st, the day before such a nutty plan would be taking place) that it was a GOOD idea to utilize three different assassins, who would ALL be drilling JFK's body (potentially) with many bullets in just a short 6-to-8-second time period -- with several of these missiles coming from OBVIOUS non-Oswald (non-""Patsy"") locations?

Were these conspirators of the opinion (somehow) that JFK would be pronounced ""dead"" right there in the limousine, right there in Dealey Plaza, and would then be driven IMMEDIATELY to some ""Conspiracy Morgue"" someplace where all the wounds that have just been inflicted upon the President would be ""controlled"" by the same evil henchmen who conceived of this plot?

Did the people who dreamed up this impossible-to-pull-off ""Frame-The-Lone-Patsy"" plot really NOT consider the possibility of ALL six shots striking President Kennedy (or all six shots hitting SOMEBODY in Dealey Plaza)?

Did these plotters just automatically assume that all of the ""frontal-shot"" evidence (that would have invariably blown the Patsy Plot to bits just minutes after the gunfire had ceased in Dealey Plaza) wouldn't be noticed by ANY Parkland personnel -- and that ZERO of these many bullets that would be potentially entering the body of John F. Kennedy (or any other victims who might be accidentally hit) would ALL simply ""get lost"" on their own or wouldn't be seen by ANY non-plotters?

Or was it the conspirators' belief that all of these bullets would immediately be collected by some additional conspirators within the hospital? Or -- did the plotters just feel it wouldn't make any difference how many bullets had pelted JFK's body, and that any 'Non-Oswald' bullet wounds would simply be ""taken care of"" by other ""after-the-shooting"" conspirators who were in charge of the ""Cover-Up"" operation? Kind of a reckless plan and a very large risk to take -- don't you think?

Plus: Did these clandestine assassins really NOT consider the potential eyewitness accounts of the literally hundreds of witnesses who were scattered throughout Dealey Plaza to watch the President pass by? (Many of them with cameras, who would be photographing the dastardly deed, potentially acquiring the filmed proof of conspiracy within their still photos and motion pictures!)

Did the plotters just GET LUCKY when not one single witness saw ANY assassin other than the killer located in the ""Oswald window"" in the Depository? And did they just get lucky that the vast majority of earwitnesses heard only three shots (the EXACT number that Oswald could have fired in the allotted assassination timeframe)?

And: Did the conspirators also just ""luck out"" when very, very few witnesses (less than 5% total) said that they heard shots coming FROM MORE THAN ONE DIRECTION? (And the vast majority of these witnesses heard shots from BEHIND the President's car, from the direction of the School Book Depository.)

Didn't ANY of these things go through the heads of these assassination-planning operatives? If these potential ""problems"" with their screwball plan didn't enter their brains, these guys weren't earning their covert dollars, that's for sure.

Shouldn't just a small bit of common sense and practicality have crept into the minds of these people (whoever they were supposed to be)? And shouldn't at least one of these plotters have spoken up and said on 11-21-63: ""Gee, fellas, this plan seems a little bit loony to me. We're asking three different killers to all fire rifle bullets at JFK at virtually an identical point in time and yet also expect ALL of the trace evidence to, somehow, some way, immediately lead back to Oswald's window and only Oswald's rifle. Hmmm....maybe we ought to re-think the probability of this plan succeeding. Ya think?""

But -- Per CTers, I guess nobody on the ""JFK Assassination Plot"" payroll made any such logical statement, and, therefore, the almost-certain-to-collapse plot was allowed to proceed, as planned.

The ""Common Sense"" truth re. this mess that Oliver Stone purports in his movie is this --- From a PRE-assassination standpoint, a conspiracy plan as depicted in this film would have been just plain suicide for any team of conspirators, and is a plot that only a crazy person would think of going forward with. Which is the main reason why no such plan of this nature would have been implemented on 11-22-63; nor would such a foolish plot have even been considered in the first place, given the many obvious hazards and complications that such a ""Patsy"" operation would have presented.

It's hilariously absurd from every given angle! Hard to believe any reasonable-thinking person can actually believe such ""Oswald Was Merely A Patsy"" nonsense.

A portion of the ""hilarity"" in it stems from the idea that these behind-the-scenes plotters (who were supposedly manipulating Oswald like a puppet on a string) couldn't have cared less about the precise whereabouts of their one-and-only ""Patsy"" at the time JFK was being murdered.

Because, per this movie, Lee Harvey is left free to roam the lower floors of the Depository building at his leisure (while supposedly waiting for a telephone call that never came), leaving him free to inadvertently establish himself a perfect alibi for his location and movements at exactly 12:30 PM on November 22 (should anyone happen to see him on the lower floors at 12:30).

A great job by those ""Real Killers"" at keeping Oswald WHERE THEY NEEDED HIM, on the 6th Floor, huh? I guess it was just another instance (among gobs) where the ""real killers"" simply lucked out that afternoon, by not having one single person inside the Book Depository get even a brief glimpse of Lee Oswald on the lower TSBD floors at the time JFK is being killed outside the building. Will the grand luck of these conspirators ever run out? Per most CTers....apparently it never has.

I think it's kind of interesting that Director Stone decided not to accept Robert Groden's complete version of the assassination. In his book (""The Killing Of A President""), Groden, who served as a technical adviser on the film ""JFK"", tells his readers of his conspiracy theory which involves a MINIMUM of 8 shots (and possibly even more). And, incredibly, Mr. Groden claims that NONE of these eight bullets likely came from the Oswald window in the TSBD! ~LOL break~ .... Please note that even Mr. Stone didn't ""buy"" that silliness.

But, as far as Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" filmmaking is concerned, I think it's quite good. Very authentic-looking 1963-era ""re-creations"" were filmed of Dealey Plaza and the motorcade (with an appropriate amount of old-time ""graininess"" added to the new imagery), which have been intercut throughout the movie with actual news clips and amateur film footage. At times, it is difficult to discern between the re-creations and actual archival footage (although JFK assassination experts will have no trouble spying the differences). The editing of this picture is on a level way above anything else you're likely to see anywhere. And the John Williams music score is also superb.

I have the 2-Disc Widescreen DVD edition of ""JFK: Special Edition Director's Cut"" (in the ""Snapper"" type case) that was released by Warner Home Video on February 6, 2001, which does not include the 90-minute ""Beyond JFK: The Question Of Conspiracy"" documentary that is available on the newer (2003) 2-Disc SE.

This 2001 edition, though, does sport a beautiful Anamorphic (16x9-enhanced) DVD transfer (in the wide ""scope"" aspect ratio of 2.35:1). That fabulous music of John Williams shines brightly, too, via the disc's rich-sounding Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. This DVD might own the record for most ""Chapter Breaks"", too (88 of 'em)!

The bonus features on this (2001) 2-Disc DVD set aren't really that much to write home about, IMO. There's an Audio Commentary Track by Oliver Stone and some ""Deleted/Extended Scenes"" (which I did enjoy seeing). But the totality of the extras on this older DVD edition seem to be a tad on the weak side -- especially the feature on Disc 2 called ""Multimedia Essays"", which is pretty much dry as dust, IMHO. (Of course, I say this as a staunch ""LNer"" who believes in Lee Oswald's lone guilt in the JFK and J.D. Tippit murders; so {possibly} that's part of the reason I fail to see a whole bunch of redeeming qualities in these conspiracy-slanted ""Essays"" that are presented here.)

----------------

Some Closing ""JFK"" Thoughts & Recommendations.........

I enjoy watching Mr. Stone's ""JFK"" -- but from the standpoint of ""fictional drama"" only; and certainly not from any kind of ""historically accurate"" POV at all. The ""CT-created drama"", along with the music score and the outstanding editing together of re-constructed scenes with real 11-22-63 film footage are all things that are noteworthy in the movie.

But I'll stick with my own (and Vincent Bugliosi's) version of assassination events (i.e., Oswald was guilty as sin and had no helpers), rather than take a huge leap off the conspiracy diving board, where every theory being discussed is as cloudy and murky as the ""Badge Man"" image in Mary Moorman's famous Polaroid photograph.

The next time you watch this movie, take notes and count the number of times where the evidence is presented in anything close to an ""unbiased"" manner. At the end of the 3-hour motion picture, you'll still be left with a blank piece of notepaper.

At the very least, the movie should have a disclaimer crawling along at the bottom of the screen every ten minutes while watching it. Something akin to .... ""What you are watching is a fictional account of a true-life event. Handle with care; and with lots of salt.""

I'd advise anyone interested in the JFK assassination to seek out (at any cost) the amazingly-good 1964 documentary ""Four Days In November"" (MGM/UA Home Video). It's a 123-minute journey back to November 1963 that is supported by the FACTS and EVIDENCE in the JFK case. It gives a detailed and thorough chronology of all four days surrounding President Kennedy's assassination, including Ruby killing Oswald and also a look at the hard facts supporting Lee Oswald's blatantly-obvious guilt in the murder of police officer J.D. Tippit.

""Four Days In November"" is the antithesis of Oliver Stone's fantasy film. I'd strongly recommend to everyone that they watch ""Four Days"" immediately after watching Stone's film. It's a night-and-day difference, of course. But at least ""Four Days"" is based on a little something that Mr. Stone's ""JFK"" doesn't get within a country mile of -- i.e.: The documented and verified facts of the events of November 22, 1963.

So, I'd say -- Watch Oliver Stone's slickly-presented piece of motion-picture entertainment by all means. But don't forget the salt shaker. Because it shall be needed.",1133481600,13,14094,5.026575225032148
97249,4,0790729733,"Sure, it takes all sorts of liberties.  Even after you subtract the understandable dramatic license, the combined characters, the name changes, and other switch-a-roos that you can expect from any movie based on real events or where mysterious amounts of money & lawyers seeming to be protecting certain individuals from needed scrutiny, there are still some inaccuracies in this film.  Stone admitted it and has said JFK is meant to get people to ask questions, not as the final authoritative word.  It's one undeniably plausible possibility, if you'll pardon the reversal of that phrase.  You also have to take into account that Newman and Prouty had as much influence in shaping the final conclusions this film comes to about the assassination as Garrison himself.  But on the whole, it gets enough of it correct and still manages to be surprisingly fair for such an admittedly subjective film.

In spite of even John Marrs' (???) alleged influence, the movie JFK does a phenomenal job portraying the story from Jim Garrison's own perspective -- paranoia, stubbornness, fixation on Clay Shaw, and all.  It even presents, in the heat of the moment, the automatic assumptions attributing the MLK and RFK assassinations to the same conspiracy.  I mean, who wouldn't?  It was insanity.  You had the CIA purposely sabotaging his investigation (Helms and Marchetti both admitted this later), death threats, witnesses changing stories or dying, evidence the FBI, Secret Service, Dallas PD, and Warren Commission had subverted the original investigation (which we now know is also a fact, regardless of the motives).  The whole world seemed to be closing in around him.  His wife even brings up his apparent persecution of Shaw's alleged homosexuality, something others would rely on later to try and discredit Garrison, including the next DA Harry Connick Sr (yes, the dad), who gained notoriety for trying to withhold the Garrison files from the ARRB by throwing a former cop and reporter in jail.

True, Garrison wasn't even in the courtroom for much the trial; he didn't need to be.  That wouldn't have been very interesting or entertaining for a film, though, which works best with a central protagonist up front and center doing the most visible work.  Garrison also wasn't present to see David Ferrie's rant about ""a mystery wrapped up in an enigma""... or words to that effect, but it works better than him hearing it from the colleague second hand.  Garrison did roughly make a similar, rousing closing speech at the trial, however.  And years later the judge even said he regretted that Shaw got off.  We know now that Shaw and Bertrand were the same person, he did work for the agency, and was involved in overseas plots.  We also know that Walter Sheridan at NBC was trained by the CIA and then sheep-dipped into NSA.  So they had been literally 'out to get' Garrison.  I would complain there's a lack of the religious and extremist component that Garrison stumbled upon.  It gets even weirder.  I suppose for the early 1990s, bringing that up may have prevented the film from even being made.

Whether he took full advantage of it, or not, Stone does have an exceptional knowledge of the subject.  In a forum coinciding with the film's release, he was clearly the strongest debater.  Others, like Edward Epstein, were forced to concede numerous facts to him.  Though on the right general track, I do not think Garrison was necessarily correct on all accounts.  That does not change the issue that justice was obstructed.  The excuse may have been that Shaw was innocent and national security was at stake.  Perhaps so, but there's a reason the process was not allowed to produce that conclusion itself.  Certainly you can't blame Garrison for pointing in the direction of the dirty laundry when he smelled something rotten.  Nor is it appropriate to disparage those who think there might be more to the case.",1128124800,4,3915,4.9479326186830015

A treasured picture that will be increasing gradually through years, once the actual generations or the previous who lived and witnessed the sordid JFK `s assassination and all the set of dark events hidden backstage.

Stone recreates through a superb edition work a true sinister puzzle of unknown mechanism, disproving the pretended and infantile argument that argues Lee Harvey Oswald was the only brain master and executor of  this horrid fact. Kevin Costner starring Jim Garrison will be the assigned spokesman to reveal step by step, the immense tangle and multiple circuital web of facts and characters evolved. The thesis of the self will bullet that described a curious path is a trick that hardly could be managed by the same Dave Copperfield.

97263,2,0790729733,"Oliver Stone has created a film ""monster"" that forsakes the facts of the Kennedy assassination, and focuses on a pure imaginary conspiracy that is the ""brainchild"" of New Orlean's District Attorney Jim Garrison.  Wow, does Stone ever take liberty with the facts to present Garrison's deeply flawed and unproven theory!  Yet, because he is a good dramatic filmmaker, Stone makes this film very interesting and intriguing, and leaves the (uninformed and casual) viewer with the sense that a great travesty was inflicted on the American public with the death of JKF.  In essense, Garrison's theory was that Clay Shaw, a prominant businessman in New Orleans, arranged for the assassination of JFK and recruited a bunch of shady underworld characters to do the job for him, one of which was Lee H. Oswald.  Garrison's complex theory has Lyndon Johnson as the eventual source of the asassination, as Lyndon's motivation was to obtain the power of the presidency.  Of course, there is actually NO proof of anything in Garrison's theory, and in a court trial (which is the film's climax), the case against Clay Shaw is dropped for lack of evidence and he is declared innocent.

Garrison got a lot of press out of his theory and antics, and he was a media darling appearing on late night talk shows giving the audience nothing but innuendos and half-truths.  Yet, the public was intrigued by a man such as Garrison who so confidently proclaimed he knew the REAL truth about the Kennedy assassination and would shortly break the news and case wide open.  Of course he never did.  What he did do was ruin Clay Shaw's business and life, and all because Garrision sought personal fame and the spotlight.  Garrison used Clay Shaw to elevate himself, destroying Shaw in the process.

Kevin Costner is excellent as Jim Garrison, and because of Stone's script and Costner's performance, the viewer wants to believe that Garrison was a man who was after the truth and acted with honor and within the law.  Unfortunately for reality, the cold hard facts say otherwise.

Stone sets back the Kennedy assassination light years with his untruthful account and his impact on viewers who have had little exposure to the real facts about the assassination.  This is why his book is a ""monster"", as Stone has set off his eager viewers down a path that leads nowhere.  If Stone wanted to do service to the Kennedy assassination, he could have least selected a conspiracy theory that had some basis in fact; in this case, Garrison's theory has been shown by several authors to be completely without truth or merit - a complete fabrication of Garrison's immagination.

While the acting and story are worth a 5-star rating, the real truth about the assassination takes a beating and I cannot give this film a positive rating.  If you want to view the film as a pure effort in fiction, then it could perhaps be rated a 4-star movie, however, it's message is that Lyndon Johnson had Kennedy killed, and this is a charge that must be taken seriously and not lightly.  Therefore, I say avoid this film.  It will fill your mind with half-truths and conspiracies and will not point you to the truth.

97264,3,0790729733,"First off I will start by saying that I thought this was a great film.  I truly loved it and bought into the conspiracy theories.  The acting is truly superb and despite the length of the movie it is never boring.  The characters are very compelling and it is a true ensemble cast with a lot of great cameo performances.

So why the 3 star rating?  Shortly before I left for Thailand I saw a documentary on either the Discovery channel, A&E, or the History channel sorry I can't remember which.  This documentary was basically done in a myth busters fashion going point for point over all of the conspiracy theories regarding JFK's assassination.  They use all of the material Stone and the cosnpiracy theorists used and nothing new.  They expose where facts were misrepresented and also where they were fabricated.

It was truly outstanding.  They recreated the shooting.  Showing LHO would have had a couple extra seconds to fire and most likely fired the first shot before the tree rather than after it.  A couple of shooters were also brought in and shot within the original time frame and the new time frame.  Only one person fell slightly outside the original time frame and that is because his rifle jammed.  He recovered and fired quickly.

They show the actual balistics of the firing and use real experts to do this.  There was no magic bullet of any sort.  No extra shooters from the grassy knoll.  One shooter could have easily and most likely have done all of the firing.

The escape down the stairway was not only accomplished it was accomplished rather easily.  In fact one could have done it twice in the allotted time.  The people doing this were only in fair shape and were not winded at all.

The escape from the boarding house was also discredited.  If you look at the witness statements none clearly saw LHO walk the established route.  Stone uses testimony from a very old and near sighted lady as his concrete evidence.  If you take the more plausible routes that LHO would have taken then he would have made it with plenty of time.

Why was Jack Ruby there to shoot LHO?  Jack Ruby was well known to always carry a pistol.  He was at the same place paying off a fine of some sort and decided to take his place in history.  He was there for a reason and not to kill LHO.

The documentary was awesome and changed my mind completely on the events surrounding JFK's assassination.  I highly recommend watching it.  I just wish I could remember its name.  The movie is still fun to watch to get a feel for all the speculation that went into the assasination.

Tippit was killed to draw attention away from Dealey Plaza because a number of men had been arrested there, including The 3 Tramps who were really CIA Agents David Lemar Christ, Howard Hunt & Frank Sturgis.

I'd love to tell you I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll, AND give you ALL irrefutable proof that it's the God's honest truth, but who would believe me?

97268,4,0790729733,"In 1969, New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison brought noted New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw to trial for conspiracy to murder President John F. Kennedy. To date, this is the only trial of any individual in reference to the Kennedy assasination.  This controversial 1991 film follows Garrison's investigation into the Kennedy assasination from the day of Kennedy's death to the conclusion of the trial--and it has prompted almost as much controversy as the assasination itself.

How much of this film are we to take as fact and how much of it are we take as fiction?  Critics have noted that as a historian, Stone is a great filmmaker, and with JFK Stone creates a vision so extreme that even some conspiracy theorists have denounced it as completely impossible.  But that may actually be part of the film's point: that we live in a society that typically subverts the truth, a world in which facts are hard to come by and in which speculation runs wild.

However you wish to take the film, there's no denying that it is exceptionally well done.  Much of its power rests on visuals.  JFK is presented on different film stocks with various grains and color qualities, and these scenes--some of them lasting only seconds--are combined like pieces of an jigsaw puzzle to create a slowly emerging picture of American politics at its worst. The script, largely based on Garrison's book ON THE TRAIL OF THE ASSASINS, works in much the same fashion, shifting rapidly from scene to scene and back and forth in time. In combination, cinematography and script have a cumulative power that is most impressive, and Williams' haunting score adds greatly to the effect.

The ensemble cast is easily one of the best I've ever seen. Kevin Costner is not, perhaps, ideally cast as Jim Garrison--but he plays in an extremely low-key manner completely devoid of any ""star"" trappings, and thus throws focus on the myriad of characters who swirl through the story. Gary Oldman is uncanny as Lee Harvey Oswald. His performance is such that you're often unsure if you watching Oldman or news footage of Oswald, and Brian Doyle-Murray achieves a similar effect with the smaller role of Jack Ruby.

But perhaps the most memorable are the host of actors who appear in unlikely roles and who aquit themselves exceptionally well. Joe Pesci gives a typically aggressive performance in the strange role of a right-wing paramilitary homosexual, Kevin Bacon is completely unexpected and flawless as a hard-bitten gay prostitute, and Tommy Lee Jones is impressive as the influential Clay Shaw. Other memorable performers include Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Sally Kirkland, and Donald Sutherland--and in a wicked twist of irony Jim Garrison himself appears as Justice Earl Warren.

The package includes a number of extras, including an often interesting director's commentary, an interview with famous conspiracy theorist Prouty, and a documentary on certain intriguing records recently declassified by Congress as a direct result of this film's impact. Then there is the film itself, which includes several previously cut scenes and which is extremely well transferred to DVD.

Historians and theorists will probably wrangle over the JFK assasination for decades, perhaps centuries to come. But whether you buy into Oliver Stone's scenario in whole, in part, or not at all, film is both extremely well-done and provocative to the max. If you want to stir conversation, this will do it.

97280,5,0790729733,"It's a great and fascinating film, but Stone should have framed it up more as a trip into one man (Jim Garrison's) mind rather than what it becomes: an authoritative litany of supposedly factual evidence.  Subtlety and understatement are _not_ this film's strong suites.  You start detecting a relentless one-sidedness that could have been alleviated by presenting both sides of the coin.. for instance, many people went on record as hearing more than 3 shots fired, some from the direction of the rail yard, but couldn't someone quip ""with all the tall buildings in Dealy Plaza, there must have been lots of echoes and accoustical artifacts"".  Or when Sutherland relates that the D.C. phone system went dead for an hour immediately after the shooting he could have added "".. or maybe this was just from a sudden overload of calls, I don't know"".

This picture is still visually and technically remarkable although some techniques, such as the unsteady slo-mo with tracer effect have been mimicked and made passe by reality TV.  Casting was great but more true-blue southerners in some of the high profile roles (esp. Garrison) would have been good, for more authenticity in accents and chemistry of interaction.

After first seeing ""JFK"" in 1991 I remember feelings of outrage and that my eyes had been opened to the way ""things really are"".  The second time around, I did notice in the opening credits that the film is based on a couple of books, one by Garrison, and this clued me in to the fact that this film is a journey into Garrison's world, however monomaniacal and obsessionist it may be.  Stone should have taken more opportunites to make this distinction clear.

What sticks with me after viewing ""JFK"" this time around, is the laughable lack of security for the Dallas motorcade, then after the shots were fired the cascade of chaos, human error, and implausible coincidence.  A lot of Garrison's theorizing and Mr. X's monologue seem obsessionist and half-baked (kind of like those intense conversations from your pot-head days that seemed so profound at the time but then incoherent when you think back later).

My money is on this scenario: that the assassination was planned and done by a motley fringe group of individuals including Oswald, who had ties to rightist Cuban exiles and indirectly to low-level CIA; that the shots went crack, crack, crackBANG with the 4th shot coming from the rail yard; that the behavior at Parklawn, Bethedsa, and by LBJ and the Warren Commission was not an orchestrated coverup but independent reactions of officials who saw red flags and inconsistencies but felt, in the heat of the moment, that the whole episode had to be put behind as quickly and cleanly as possible to avoid a descent into a national state of anarchy.  From our comfortable, relatively stable vantage point in the year 2005 this seems like about the worst thing they could have done, but I guess you had to have been there.",1110153600,,2946,4.881763527054108
97281,4,0790729733,"The Warren Report is the basic starting point for anybody who is even remotely interested in researching the JFK assassination. The book is massive - nearly 2 inches thick, 9 inches in length and 6 inches in width and clocks in at 888 pages. There are many illustrations and photographs to help break the monotony and they are helpful in understanding the text.

Be forewarned. This report is not to be taken at face value. It promotes itself while at the same time laying blame on everybody from Oswald to the Secret Service and the Dallas County Police. The movie JFK is critical of this book's findings, because of its omissions. This is what the movie JFK hopes to explore.

The warren commission report starts with its summary and conclusions - that Oswald acted alone in killing President Kennedy and that there was no conspiracy. It then gives a brief synopsis of the assassination and the circumstances surrounding the events on November 22nd 1963. We see these in the movie. The report continues by developing the scenario in the Texas School Book Depository including the evidence gained from witnesses at the scene and the recovery of the riffle, spent shells and prints. Connections are established between Oswald and the riffle and the School Book Depository building before moving on to the motive and Oswald's background, Oswald's detention, the media, Oswald's murder and his assassin - Jack Ruby. The film is mostly about dealing with investigating a possible conspiracy, challenging the Warren report in-depth with expert witness testimony, with the big court room showdown that in the end leaves you feeling that Oswald did not do it.

Great movie, through and through. Hard not to love it. Why only 4 stars?

Oswald was involved in the slaying of Officer J.D Tippit and this is a clincher. The murder of patrolman Tippit is a key event which shows that Oswald was capable of murder and was also on a killing frenzy at the time of the assassination. The movie really does bend the reality of this problem by saying that it was a number of agents pretending to be Oswald.

He also tried to shoot officers when he was apprehended in the film theatre. Did Oswald shoot President Kennedy? Probably Yes. Could the Magic bullet theory work? It is possible. Did Jack Ruby kill Oswald on the spur of the moment? The facts surrounding this are vague. Did Oswald act alone? It is possible but unlikely. Does the Warren report do justice for the American people and the people of the world? Absolutely not. Does the Warren report deliberately neglect important and relevant information? Absolutely. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald on the assassination of President Kennedy based on the evidence? Probably not because there is too much doubt at large to deal with. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald of the murder J.D Tippit? Yes. Is there a cover-up and if so why?

The truth is that there is probably a cover-up involved and the Warren report as it stands today is absolute proof that the US government at the time was knee-deep in a conspiracy of some kind simply based on its omissions and neglect to deal with highly important and relevant evidence. Was there a government conspiracy to assassinate the President? Probably not, but there was a cover-up of a conspiracy of some kind and this is what is at the heart of the whole assassination and the follow up events including this report. A blind eye has probably been turned to the truth surrounding the assassination because President Kennedy was considered an obstacle to many important people. In fact the Warren Commission report has all the hallmarks of a new administration that just wants to sweep everything under the carpet.

But in closing I will say this. Go try the real world simulation run of  JFKreloaded and you will see that it might be possible to actually reproduce the magic bullet. You can actually hit the President 3 times no problem, including the fatal headshot. Oswald could have done it. The simulation clearly shows that you can do it also.",1108944000,,4043,4.832369942196531
97282,5,0790729733,"Before I go into the film's speculations on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, I'll first review the film. It is a powerful film that is filled with intriguing characters played by an exceptional cast. The storyline fills the plot out rather nicely, and the courtroom scenes are intense and emotionally-charged.

Now to the theories the film presents. The Zapruder film makes it plainly obvious that the shot that killed Kennedy did NOT come from the Book Depository, but from the Grassy Knoll. The questions surrounding the assassination, and the questions about a possible cover-up, are presented quite well in this film. The film also presents a theory that is scary to contemplate, but still feasible: the only successful coup d'etat on American soil. The evidence for the conspiracy theories are presented accurately and faithfully.

The only segments I disagree with are the theories about Oswald. I still believe he fired shots from the Depository, and two of the bullets he fired hit Kennedy, but I do believe that he became the scapegoat for the conspiracy plot. Other than this little blunder, the rest of the case is presented real well in the film.

The bonus DVD features an exceptional documentary that goes beyond the film to discuss the many theories surrounding their deaths, as well as an interview with Fletcher Prouty. The deleted scenes present little good, and are a weak part of the second disc. But the doc makes up for it.

Overall, ""JFK"" isn't as good as Oliver Stone's most recent film. the epic ""Alexander,"" but it is a solid film that is fascinating in it's own right. Even if you don't believe that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy was part of a coup d'etat, you will still come out believing that Oswald didn't act alone!

97283,5,0790729733,"[This review is based upon the VHS copy of ""JFK: The Director's Cut"".  However, I recommend this two-disc DVD for the additional documentary material it brings to the table.  - Doug Peschka]

Since before ""JFK"" was first released in 1991, the national media have been jumping

all over Oliver Stone's case for not making a historically accurate documentary.

HELLO!  Oliver Stone said himself that never was his intention to begin with !!!

Folks, this movie is not about the actual facts of who really killed John Kennedy and why.

It's all about the value of every conscientious American thinking for themselves and questioning authority.

And that's what ""JFK"" does - it makes you think for yourself and ask your own questions,

and do your own thinking.  On that merit alone, it would make John Kennedy - and Robert Kennedy - both very proud.

That is what our schools' history books should do.  Not just feed us the official line that ""A lone nut named Oswald did it alone"".  But a present us with all of the known facts, and an encouragement to all students - and to all the American People - to search for the truth themselves.

In a book called Proverbs, we are reminded that ""Where there is no vision, the people perish.""

Nothing is more important than facing the world with our eyes and minds open.

That is the central meaning of ""JFK"".  When I sat in the theater in early 1992 and watched

""JFK"" I thought of the important words of Jackson Browne's 1987 hit ""Lives In The Balance"":

""You might ask what it takes to remember

when you know that you've seen it before,

where a government lies to a people

and a country is drifting to war.

They sell us the President the same way

they sell us our clothes and our cars.

They sell us everything from Youth to Religion

the same time they sell us our wars.

I want to know who the men in the shadows are

I want to hear somebody asking them why

they can be counted on to tell us who our enemies are

but they're never the ones to fight or to die.""

No, not all of ""JFK"" is fact.  But it does contain more truths

than the Warren Report does.

Question Authority.

While you still can.",1101513600,6,2147,4.415384615384616
97284,2,0790729733,"I really liked this film when I first saw it in theatres, even as I doubted a lot of methods in which Stone draws his conclusions and retells his ""facts.""  The cast is good and, to be such a long film, it holds together.

But in the years since then, a lot more has come out about the Kennedy assassination--and Stone's film.

I just watched a show on the History Channel last night that completely destroys this movie's entire conspiracy theory.  It WAS possible for Oswald to get off three shots from 88 yards (and an 89-year-old man did it nearly a dozen times to demonstrate it); the fatal head shot DID come from behind the president (as shown in the autopsy); the ""magic bullet"" DID create the wounds in Kennedy and Governor Connally without turning or ""hanging in the air"" (a computer recreation showed how everyone was sitting for that to happen).

Can these things still be argued?  I believe that anyone looking at all the data available now would have a hard time doing so.  But I know they will.  There's a paranoid guy at work who's passing out cheaply-made ""documentaries"" of what REALLY happened on 9-11, so crazy theories about everything will always be around.

It was also disappointing to find out that Jim Garrison, the crusading attorney played Kevin Costner, was revised by Stone for his movie--and that Stone completely embellished his final speech in the film.  Garrison never said that!

I don't really have much of a problem with that kind of artistic license, but only if it's acknowledged.  As long as Oliver Stone continues to insist that his version of JFK is reality, then it tends to make open-minded viewers a little squeamish.

""Well, if that's not how it happened, then it should have!""

That sounds more like something Michael Moore would say....",1100995200,5,1782,4.724919093851133
97285,1,0790729733,"Okay, the film is very entertaining.  There, I've said it.  Now on to the serious stuff.  Some people think that even if you don't believe the conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination, it is worth seeing this film because ""it makes you think"".  The tragedy of this view is that it destroys people's belief that there is something like ""the Truth"" and encourages mental laziness by not pushing people to look at the evidence, and the evidence clearly shows that the Warren Commissions conclusions about the roles of Oswald and Ruby are correct.  Many former ""conspiracy buffs"" like Norman Mailer and Gus Russo did this and admitted they had been wrong.

Oliver Stone's disregard of the truth is appalling.  First off, JFK and RFK were no ""liberal saints"" that were out to overturn a ""corrupt establishment"".  JFK was the best friend the ""military/industrial complex"" ever had.  He poured huge amounts of money into it by carrying out the biggest peacetime military build-up in history and by giving the go-ahead for the Apollo program to put a man on the Moon by 1970.  JFK moved very cautiously on civil rights and appointed segregations judges to the Federal Courts.  After the Bay of Pigs, he felt the CIA should be more tightly controlled and so he put in brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy as unofficial overseer of the organization, taking a VERY active role in Operation Mongoose which was to remove Castro from power in Cuba, by assassination if necessary.  Kennedy was making contradictory statements about Vietnam, but there was no real indication he had a concrete plan to pull out, and it must be remembered that President Eisenhower also decided in 1954 not to get involved in helping the French there, thus allowing a Communist takeover of North Vietnam and yet the CIA and the Establishment didn't decide to rub him out. We see that JFK and RFK were no threat to the ""establishment"" and even if he was, they could have easily gotten rid of them by leaking information about JFKs poor health or  his scandalous womanizing involving women who had Mafia or East German connections, all of which FBI Director J Edgar Hoover and many others including journalists knew about but handled discreetely, so there was no need to come up with the ridiculous assassination scheme Stone invents in this film.

In the ridiculous trial of Clay Shaw (who was acquitted by the jury after only a few minutes deliberation-showing how effective a prosecutor that charlatan Jim Garrison was) Garrison quickly points out that there were ""several teams of shooters"" in Dealey Plaza.  Where is there any shred of evidence of this?  Yet, this is presented as fact.  This is symptomatic of everything that is wrong with this genre of film.  It is unfortunate that this anti-intellectualism and cynicism is spreading throughout modern society leading to things like Holocaust denial, racism, support for international terrorism and the like.  I hope everyone takes note of this and steers clear of this film and its ilk.",1100649600,22,3019,4.9425742574257425
97286,5,0790729733,"That no, in this case it does not. Regardless of whether you believe that the assasination of JFK was a conspiracy, this movie is well worth the time. It is significant for its courage in bringing to the front of viewer's minds the thought that yes, our government can, and sometimes does, conceal the truth from its people. This movie's scope is not simply the assasination of John F. Kennedy, but the naive belief that our government, and indeed any government, should be blindly trusted. By reminding us that all power corrupts, this film illustrates the simple fact that every citizen must question his government's motives and actions, and that in order for democracy to continue, information must flow freely.",1100390400,7,715,4.966666666666667
97287,2,0790729733,"This film is without question effective and engrossing, done by a very talented director.

As a history of the Kennedy assassination, however,  it is a horrible joke, all the worse because people take it at face value. Stone comes from  the 'throw-it-all-at-them' school of conspiracy theories, where he's completely unconcerned whether all of his facts are correct, fit together, or even contradict each other; he just wants you to accept something, anything.

He had been a hero to me before this film, with 'Salvador', 'Platoon', and 'Wall Street', but he lost me completely and forever with this cynical pack of lies. He surely knew that much of what he was putting out here was false but did it anyway. An absolute disgrace.

To go through all the evidence here is, naturally, impossible, but perhaps one typical example wouldn't go amiss: Stone calls Oswald a good American, just trying to live a good life. Here's the truth, well-established and documented. Oswald bought the rifle and was even photographed with it, photos verified by top experts.  He used the rifle to try and kill General Edwin Walker 6 months before, a fact verified by forensics and by the testimony of Marina, to whom he admitted it. On the night before the assassination he stayed with Marina (they were separated), breaking what had been his habit (he generally only stayed on weekends), because he had to pick up the rifle which was kept in the garage. He took it with him, in the guise of 'curtain rods' wrapped in paper (what a phenomenal coincidence, to have taken something the same shape and length as a rifle to work the day of the assassination!!), to work the next day. That morning he left his wedding ring and almost all of his money with Marina (what a coincidence, to have done this on the day of the assassination!). Then, after the assassination, he abruptly left without speaking to anyone, rushed home to grab a pistol, left immediately, entered a cinema without paying (I'm skipping the murder of the policeman, assuming him a ""good citizen"")then fought a policeman who approached him, even pulling the trigger, which didn't fire. All of this is fact and well-documented by unimpeachable sources. Does this sound like the actions of an innocent man to you, as Stone would have it? What a joke!!!

If you must see this thing then enjoy it as drama, taking the rest with a grain of salt. I know there isn't the least chance of this, however.",1100390400,7,2439,4.779097387173397
97288,5,0790729733,"Stop the tape a minute, tell Mr. Zapruder to put down his camera, get comfy beside me here on this nice grassy knoll, and ignore that guy with the umbrella---he's probably one of ours---and let's ask one of the great, burning questions of our age:

Is Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" worth a watch?

Absolutely!---but you don't need to convene the Warren Commission to tell you that. Oliver Stone serves up a typically kinetic, visually arresting, deliciously conspiratorial and roaringly over-the-top film in ""JFK"", in which you're best served to worry less about historical authenticity, and just sit back and enjoy the movie for the feat of cinematic virtuosity that it is.

Right from the start, Stone leaps in with style, wit, a well-equipped army of solid ensemble actors, and a crack team of skilled editors helmed up by his faithful Director of Photography Robert Richardson (who has worked on all of Stone's projects, from ""Wall Street"" to ""Natural Born Killers""); Stone digs in from the beginning and goes to work with the aplomb of a natural---and gifted---storyteller.

Stone has a little help from his friends, to be sure: Jim Marrs, (who wrote ""Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy"") and the still-crusading Jim Garrison (the New Orleans DA who wrote ""On the Trail of the Assassins"" and even appears in the film as his old nemesis, former Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren!) worked with Stone on the screenplay.

That ""JFK"" is a work of passion is quite evident, and redounds to the credit of its screenwriters. That it is a work of somewhat dubious historical authenticity is, alas, not so evident---and again, that is due to the cinematic wizardry Stone works in putting you on Dealey Plaza on that sultry Dallas afternoon 40 years ago. But like the best New Orleans gumbo, it's not what's in the stew that counts, it's how it tastes---and this gumbo tastes mighty fine!

All of this style and substance is put at the service of a contention that seems an article of faith by Stone: that President Kennedy was cut down not by a raving Marxist madman with a grudge and a mail-order rifle, but by a shadowy cabal of politicians and industrialists entrenched in the very highest levels of American government.

""JFK"" puts you at the side of young New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison(played adroitly by Kevin Costner in one of his best performances), who, four years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, begins to delive into a sordid underground of New Orleans tycoons and orgiasts, spies and con-men, Cuban exiles and CIA spooks, mercenaries and mobsters.

His suspicion aroused, Garrison reorganizes his office into a single-minded legal SWAT team designed to investigate the shadowy New Orleans bon vivant ""Clay Bertrand"", who may have had a hand in a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy---and to not only question the findings of the Warren Report, but to launch an investigation into the complicity of the White House into the death of the former president.

For all of its political immediacy and slick cinematographic techniques, ""JFK"" is more sweaty Southern potboiler than stern Yankee conspiracy theory, owing far more to sultry Faulknerian southern town mysteries and the forbidden, sweltering interludes of Tennessee Williams. Stone uses every resource at his disposal to ratchet up an atmosphere of oppression and menace: characters don't just talk, they sweat rivers, their eyes dart nervously about, they pace like caged tigers, the camera tracking their edgy, jerky movements.

All of this is supported by impeccable acting: ""JFK"" is studded with top-drawer talent, most of whom engage in a feeding frenzy of scene-chewing. Costner is given a foil in Tommy Lee Jones at his most sardonic as the elegant and poised Clay Shaw, who exudes menace in even the most genteel purr. Kevin Bacon is creepy, sinister, and volatile as Garrison's useless 'witness' Willie O'Keefe, while Joe Pesci lets the hairpiece do the acting as the unstable David Ferrie. Jack Lemmon anticipates his ""Glengarry"" act as Jack Martin, condemned to be forever pistol-whipped by a hulking Ed Asner (who plays the bilious, mysterious Guy Bannister); John Candy literally sweats bullets, hides behind his Ray-Bans, and chomps a cigar. And what conspiracy theory movie is complete without an obligatory appearance by Donald Sutherland as the mysterious Agent X?

All of this works some powerful ju-ju: the movie is spookier than a decrepit New Orleans antebellum plantation at midnight, and spicier than a pot of gumbo. The new Director's Cut restores 17 minutes of material left cut from the theatrical run, and the new bits both reinforce and detract from the power of the original. On the plus side, we get a little more of the tactics used by Garrison's shadowy enemies to knock him off the trail of the assassins, including one of his creepier close calls at the New Orleans airport. On the down side, the restored sequence featuring Garrison on a campy, kitschy talk-show hosted by John LaRoquette feels like nails on a chalkboard; it plays like parody, and does nothing but detract from the seriousness and pacing of the film.

If ""JFK"" raises questions about one of the more dubious and traumatic periods of our collective American memory, that's well and good---though the viewer should beware: Stone plays fast and loose with the historical record. But in building up an account of the assassination, Stone has created a modern masterpiece, a film that transcends the limitations of its subject and produces a creepy-crawly classic.",1099699200,,5545,5.048087431693989

97304,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is a monstrous epic that revolves around the whole mystery around President Kennedy's assassination.  While it is a dramatic picture and Stone most likely twisted a few things to make this a more relevant and better movie, it is still an undeniable powerhouse that has you go through a whole set of emotions, ranging from fear, anger, paranoia and sadness.  There's no question that the majority of the country believes that there is more to the assassination than we were lead to believe.  I don't think it's exactly how it is in the movie, but that's not important.  What is important is that the film works for many reasons.

President Kennedy has been assassinated.  Lee Harvey Oswald is the suspect and gets shot shortly after.  There is a secretive and brief hearing on the whole assassination, and it is in stone that Oswald was a lone gunman and nobody else was involved.  Seems like an open-and-shut-case, but District Attorney Jim Garrison isn't willing to buy it.  With his staff, they decide to work on the case, until they are shut down by the government.  Three years later, Garrison isn't willing to stand by in silence anymore and decides to go ahead with the case.  The further he digs, the more horrible truths he uncovers.  Not only that, but people high up in the ranks are willing to do anything to make sure that the American Public will never find out about them.

As I said, this isn't meant to be an entirely accurate portrayal of how everything happened.  It suggests to you that it could've been this way, and it even does a good job of presenting its case to you.  What I think Stone was trying to achieve was to create his own commentary on how people feel about the handling of the whole assassination and how sloppily the case was handled.  The film wasn't made to merely exploit the death of Kennedy, but what it does exploit is the fact that we're willing to believe anything they tell us in the media.  It's a hard concept to grasp, because it's not too far from the truth.  The movie is brilliantly directed and well-acted.  Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career.  The film has a whole list of famous actors in it, like Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek and a whole bunch more.  They are all fantastic in their roles.

A word of warning; this is a VERY LONG movie.  It is about 3 and a half hours long in running time.  If you want to watch this, then you have to really commit to it.  If you're not in the mood for a very lengthy movie, then you will not be able to enjoy this.  The new 2-Disc Special Edition offers a remastered director's cut that looks and sounds great.  Another interesting feature is the documentary, ""Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy.""  Extras included are deleted/extended scenes, commentary from the director, theatrical trailer, essays and DVD-ROM features.  A very nice package that does the film justice.

JFK"" is an amazing picture that did not bore me for a single second.  Not only does it work as a powerful drama, but it also works as an intense thriller.  Did everything happen the way the movie proposes?  Maybe, maybe not.  What the film does is make you think about everything that happened around the assassination.  Any film that can get the brain thinking is more than okay in my book.  A very character-driven and passionate epic that is perfectly executed by Oliver Stone.

Based on one man's neurosis (albeit, hard to tell if that one man is Stone or Garrison), JFK purports to explain the ""conspiracy"" behind the Kennedy assassination.  If you choose to believe it, you delude yourself.  No good evidence exists that has not been explained logically in coherence with the single-assassin-Oswald theory.  Sadly, many more people will believe Stone's fraudulent tale than will ever consider investigating the details of the murder in a logical, un-hyped analysis.

97306,5,0790729733,"Understand this: film making is an Art / Industry. Art because of its all-dominant story narration (a film will always tell a story), that's why it has an Author (the director), with his or hers point of view of that single story. Its an industry because all of the human effort and huge amounts of money used to bring into screen any type of story. Unfortunately in many countries and specially in Hollywood Big Studio System, it's become all about making money, this is the Gringo way. And so, every once in while filmmaking is brought to the art level, and even better, more rarely a director with a soul and conscience delivers an important film to society and art in general, this is the case with Oliver Stone's J.F.K. Stone asks 150 questions about President Kennedy's murder, maybe he got 5 things wrong, but what about the other 145 things he got right? The Big Shots where afraid of a man that could have change things for better, wiping out their biggest moneymaker: WAR, taking away all their Power (both politically and military). Frustrated with this possibility, it became evident Kennedy had to be put to rest. If you follow the clues, understanding them in their context to the end, you will know WHO did it, and WHY they did it. J.F.K does something that has become more and more rarely in the USA film industry; it makes you Think!
Jim Garrison's fearless quest for truth against a corrupted Government has no parallel in U.S.A history, and Oliver Stone takes such a brave and honest piece of Gringo history, narrating it with his unique straight and Powerful style (the best word that describes this brilliant film). Stone has the courage to point you with his finger and say: How dare you sons of bit... The film's magnificent script was stolen twice beginning shooting. Censorship (back up by who knows who), tried to stop the movie from being shown in theaters. Fortunately the film made it to the screen. Only a keen and masterful director like Oliver Stone is capable to make such a Masterpiece, all the praises to him and his crew. More than speculations the movie becomes aware of the facts. The complexity of the script becomes a puzzle put in order. Kennedy's shot to the face, the most ridiculous bullet in all history (more spin offs and turns would had made this bullet a ballet dancer), the Shadow Conspiracy shown here with that breathtaking speech from Donald Sutherland's character inter cut with Stone's trade mark black and white documentary photography and fast paced editing. Vietnam, money, power thirst, the Zapruder film as the main key evidence, is right in your face; this is pure and honest patriotism. Further than entertainment, is captivating, the movie won't let you turn your face away. What more could you ask for? But there is more, this film will test time and go along for new generations to communicate and pass on the knowledge of this tragic event, provoking an insight conscience in every new spectator, it can't be forgotten by obvious reasons.
The new Directors Cut, features 17 minutes of never before seen footage, making the view richer, the extras will make more complete the whole picture as well as the points of view of the objective Insight especially the simultaneous commentary audio track by Oliver Stone, and the Assassination Update (The New Documents), Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy, feature-length documentary, and Meet Mr. X: The Personality and Thoughts of Fletcher Prouty. So, this is a must for your DVD collection (both the Double Disc Special Edition, Director's Cut, and the Single Disc Special Edition, Director's Cut are great).
The last thing to say about J.F.K is that it is more shocking today than it was yesterday. Why? Because it reflects today's corruption and manipulation of a Government that carries on with blood in its hands, and bloody hands are never washed clean, a lesson not enough thought in schools, its ugly but some one has to do it. J.F.K message is: Do not forget!",1092960000,5,3981,4.813138686131387

I'm sure Stone took many liberties in this film, creating kind of a conspiracy paranoia.  Acting was good, and the story was interesting...but IT'S JUST A MOVIE FOLKS!!",1092441600,,274,4.808510638297872
97308,4,0790729733,"""JFK"" is a movie that combines drama with a documentary style, and it's a shocking experience for many reasons. The movie was made back on those days when Kevin Costner was a superstar in a hot streak, with movies like ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Bull Durham"", and in this movie Costner gave one of his finest performances. He was the centerpiece of this daring and powerful movie.

But he was not alone, Oliver Stone surrounded him with an all-star cast, that includes big names like Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Walter Matthau, Wayne Knight and Vincent D'Onofrio.

""JFK"" is built with theories, some of them are obviously fiction or just a mere supposition, but a lot of them seem authentic and based in real evidence. Oliver Stone pointed the finger to almost everybody: the FBI, the CIA, Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, Clay Shaw and many others. But he seems to hit the center of the target when he practically says that Kennedy was murdered because he didn't wanted to take part in the HUGE industry that is the war, an industry that moves BILLIONS of dollars, and a big part of USA's economical power.

""JFK"" presented an innovative narrative style, it combined real footage with acted scenes, but the acted parts were processed as historical footage, he also used a fast, dynamic editing to create interest in the audience, and of course ""JFK"" is interesting and provocative at all time. ""JFK"" has great acting (although John Candy was over the top, and some hair wigs are just hilarious), great direction, a solid script (yes, some theories are too forced, but there are solid theories as well), and the movie achieves its biggest goal: the movie gives something to think about to the viewer.",1092268800,,1783,4.8202614379084965
97309,5,0790729733,"JFK is an amazing piece of cinematic propaganda second only to TRIUMPH DES WILLENS, Leni Riefenstahl's glorification of Nazi Germany, in its powers of persuasiveness.  In detailing New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner) case insinuating the involvement of prominent businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) in the murder of JFK, Stone paints several detailed scenarios of a conspiracy to murder the President.  These are so persuasive that even though he often goes a bit overboard on his ssumptions, you find yourself almost believing what he says.  I do believe there was a plot to murder Kennedy, although I wouldn't go so far as to implicate everyone in the world with the exception of Jackie O, as Stone does.

At first Costner seems totally wrong for the part, but he grows on you, and turns in a decent performance.  The rest of the actors vanish beneath the facade of their characters, including Joe Pesci, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, and Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald.  Sutherland's scene in particular is brilliantly directed and edited, as Stone has you hanging on every single word.  Forget Judi Dench in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE -- his is the best extended cameo appearance in the history of cinema.

The technical staff did just as good a job.  Editors Pietro Scalia and Joe Hutshing blend actual documentary footage with film shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson, and do such a fine job that you can never tell which is which.  The music score by John Williams is great, as almost all Williams scores are.

JFK is a film not to be missed.  Film buffs and students will admire it for its technical achievements, and the average moviegoer, regardless of whether they believe the magic bullet theory or not, will see this as top-notch entertainment.  Definitely one of the best movies of the 1990s.

EXTRAS:  The commentary by Oliver Stone is informative, focusing on historical details more than the production itself.  He definitely comes off as an authority on the era, and acquits himself nicely.  The 1992 hour-and-a-half documentary on disc two, BEYOND JFK: THE QUESTION OF CONSPIRACY, is relatively informative, but don't watch it after watching the movie, unless you want to experience conspiracy theory overload (as well, much of it is repetitive, like it's defending the movie -- and considering it was made by the film's producers, it seems almost a tie-in).  There's almost an hour of deleted scenes, with optional commentary by Stone.  All of these are very interesting, and add much to the experience of Stone's vision (especially the scene in which Oswald speaks from the grave).  Two shorter featurettes, on the real Mr X (Donald Sutherland's character) and the effect the film has had on the releasing of related documents round off the disc.

97320,3,0790729733,"Oliver Stone's JFK is a powerful, well-told story. I saw it twice when it originally hit the theaters and was impressed with the dark picture it painted of renegade government forces conspiring to kill the president. However, any perception I had that it might be true was completely undone when I came home and watched my own copy of a news clip that Stone had used in the movie.

 The news clip was from an interview that Walter Cronkite had with President Kennedy in the summer of 1963. Stone's movie used a portion of this clip to support the view that Kennedy was inclined to pull U.S. forces out of Vietnam. The movie portrayed Kennedy's desire for withdrawal as a major reason the ""military industrial complex"" wanted to kill him. In the part of the clip shown, the president tells Cronkite, ""In the final analysis, it's their [i.e. the South Vietnamese people's] war. They're the ones who have to win it or lose it.""

 The problem is, in the actual interview that I have on tape, Kennedy goes on to say, ""But I don't agree with those who say we should withdraw. That would be a great mistake -- a great mistake."" These two sentences, which were edited out of the movie, completely cut the heart out of the idea that Kennedy was about to withdraw U.S. forces from Vietnam -- thus robbing the ""military industrial complex"" of its reason for killing him!

 I asked myself, if the one place I could check the movie's claims showed the movie to be twisting the evidence in its own favor, then how should I treat the claims I couldn't check? From that point on I didn't take anything in this movie seriously. It was a good reminder not to get my history from movies. If moviemakers aren't caught tampering with evidence, they'll call their movie ""true."" But if they are caught, they'll say they were engaging in ""creative license.""

 JFK is a powerful and gripping tale -- and nothing more.",1091750400,2,1892,4.576923076923077

That said, this was an outstanding movie and really made you think about the unthinkable. There are coverups that most of us have no clue about. The higher ups regardless of what people may think pull many strings to get done what they want done. Those we have always sought to trust can also be the ones who betray us. War is money and I am convinced, that the murder of JFK was a well orchestrated event. Buy the DVD with the accompaining documentary. It amazes me how some people refuse to believe it. BELIEVE IT. I love America but we are no saints here.  Money and power is always a driving force. Don't ever think it can't happen here.

But suddenly, in the whirlwind of dizzying camera shots and angles, you realize you are witnessing dark and distorted history being unearthed.  By then you are so deep in, it is impossible to get out.
Kevin Costner is brilliant as New Orleans D.A. William Garrison, the man who brought the only public trial to this date on the JFK assassination.  A string of brilliant and well-known actors complement the film.  Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, and Tommy Lee Jones give the movie so much credibility because their performances are simply so believable, and way out of the usual roles they play.  In fact, this whole film represents a role the U.S. player that is far, far out of the role we usually play.

97323,5,0790729733,"I am a student of film, and scriptwriting. I've learned about lighting, budget cost, directing, and scriptwriting. I've even written scripts that are set in history. Ya go in cocky thinkin', yeah, I'll make this movie so historically accurate, everthing will be precise down to the very minute! But after printing out eight pounds of paper on every small detail, you start to realise that nobody, and I mean nobody can make a decent historically accurate film without losing your mind!
I've very carefully researched the assasination and I came across a very professional web site. Other web sites are very passonate, but this one was very by-the-book: something like ""I believe this, but not that, and here's twelve pages of info showing why,"" kind of thing. I E-mailed him and asked what he thought of Oliver Stone's JFK; he said he'd give it a C+. Based on my troubles, that's really good!
I have to make this clear: JFK is ENTERTAINMENT based on fact. Making a good story is hard enough, but researching facts to back it up is going to tear apart your brain!
Do we have to spell it out for you people! The film encourages you to YOUR OWN RESEARCH. Donald Sutherland even says it in the film: ""But don't trust me; do your own work, your own thinking."" Their are people out their that think they're so smart saying, ""oh look, that didn't happen in real life; I guess the movie is garbage, then."" I've seen it with ""JFK"", with ""The Passion of the Christ"", and even the fictional, ""Lord of the Rings.""
""Oh, the bullet that hit Kennedy was a tumbling bullet and that's why the bullet looks so perfect,"" they say. Let me ask you something: have you ever seen a tumbling bullet? They're flat, flat as a pancake. As if a steam roller went over it. And this bullet supposedly went through several bones. For all we know the bullet was squished AFTER it was collected (just a little, so no one will notice. Shhhh). I bet you skeptics don't know what frame of the Z-film the ""magic bullet"" hit the president? What's the name of the document stating the withdrawl of ALL U.S. troops from Vietnam by 1965? What mafia kingfish did Johnny Roselli have conections with? Do you even know who Johnny Roselli is? What about Beverly Oliver? Jim Marrs? James Tague? Perry Russo? What velocity was Oswald's rifle? WHAT WAS Oswald's rifle? Where did he buy it? Who's James Files?
This film is about judging for yourself. Check it out on the internet, buy a book, then buy the other guy's book and compair.
The more I think of the supression of this subject by the media today, the more I realise that this is not a 40 year old subject. It's here, it's now! It's in the TV! It's in the walls! It's on the radio! It's out the window! It's in the newspapers! It's just a question of who's willing to see it. Keven Costner said it best ""Don't you think THIS, has something to do with THAT! CAN'T YOU SEE!""
Who cares that there were no women on Jim Garrison's legal team (unlike in the movie). Who cares that Garrison never called Clay Shaw a liar right to his face(dramatic licence). Who cares that Garrison's closing statement was a composite of the speech he DID GIVE, lines in his book, and Stone's own additions(proper pacing of a story). That little stuff doesn't matter!

97325,5,0790729733,"What really has set the Left back is not just the failure of this film medium to accomplish their goals, but also the lack of faith accorded college professors, school textbooks, and mainstream news. So who is left to tell the real story?
Weeeeeell, my friends, we are out there. We have been waiting in the wings all these years, gathering the facts in silence, not showing our hand, waiting for judgment day. The day of reckoning is upon us. Let freedom reign.
As for ""JFK"", it is a complicated piece of fiction that would require some real research to effectively discredit all of its lies. What it did in the theatre was have one asking, ""Jeez, did that really happen?"" or ""My God, is this true?"" or ""Holy cow, I can't believe this could be."" It is major sensory overload. Innocent civilians who knew things are killed. Deception and murder are used to cover up the sordid deeds. The film requires several viewings, and frankly time, probably years, to unravel it. What happens is that various reviews, reports from historical figures and historians are read and pieced together. After a while the discovery is made that a particular ""witness"" never existed, a certain ""police officer"" is a figment of Stone's imagination, smoke in the trees, conversations, special ops guys with the inside scoop (particular ""Major X"" played by Canadian Donald Sutherland) are invented out of whole cloth. A proposition is one thing, but ""JFK"" is ""Alice in Wonderland"", a ""riddle wrapped inside an enigma, tied by a puzzle"" or whatever it is Joe Pesci says. It is exhausting.
So who killed JFK? Oh, maaaaan! Stone's answer, as best I can tell, was Lyndon Johnson, in league with the joint chiefs, because Kennedy wanted out of Vietnam and they wanted in (because American industry needed the war?), working with right wing Birchers, who were part of rogue elements of the CIA (?), who were a ""track,"" whatever that is, that could not be stopped because it was an inexorable connection starting in Guatemala (""good""), Iran (""good""), and Bay of Pigs (""not so good""), that had become dominated by Cuban exile ""Republicans,"" working in league with the Soviets (KGB?), who recruited Lee Harvey Oswald, who learned to shoot in the Marines, who lived and married in Russia then came back, who promoted Marxism but was funded by Birchers (?), who was a patsy for the Dallas Mafia, who had Oswald-lookalikes say incriminating things, who worked with JFK, who worked with La Casa Nostra (who turned on him?), who were tied to Naval Intelligence (?), who operated out of a corner in New Orleans in which the Feds, the NIS and somebody else all had offices, who were tied to right wing homosexual businessmen, defrocked priests, gay prostitutes and guys with tempers like Ed Asner, whose activities were known by corrupt New Orleans lawyers and politicians, who were in league with the New Orleans International Trade Mart or something like that, protected by Dallas strip club owners, who hatched a plan that involved Cubans training in the Florida swamps or Latin America by gay militia commandos, who bought a bad Italian rifle with a bolt action release via mail instead of purchasing a better weapon through the black market or a store, who gave it to Oswald, who may or may not have fired at JFK but could not possibly have hit his mark from the Texas Book Depository, who with Secret Service agents working to kill the President had assassins disguised as police officers and bums in the bushes, a car wreck lot and a grassy knoll, and created a triangulated cross-fire that killed the President then got away.
Now, friends and neighbors, after all of that, at no time does Mr. Stone suggest that the assassination was the work of a fellow he later visited and said was a great man, named Fidel Castro, who is the most likely suspect.
Res ipsa loquiter.
Castro and the mob? Maybe. The confusion of Stone's plot twists is highly, precisely and to quintessential effect that with which the real killers want. Stone's film vastly hurts the attempt to learn the truth. He raises plenty of legitimate questions, mainly regarding the so-called ""magic bullet,"" and he operates on at least one fairly solid foundation, which is that the Zapruder film seems to show more than one shooter. Saying Oswald was not a lone gunman is a premise I can give credence to, but beyond that God knows.
One thing is puzzling, and that is that in all the years since nobody has ""stepped forward."" Every so often somebody shows up on Larry King Live and says his father, usually a ""Dallas cop,"" was the shooter, but these stories always have the crackpot feel to them. I want a deathbed confession from a Cuban, one of Sam Giancana's guys, something solid. When all the smoke clears, you still have a Communist sympathizer, Oswald, killing a President who just humiliated Kruschev over the Bay of Pigs, is a threat to Castro and is building up troops to fight Commies in Vietnam. It is plausible he had help and they were on the Grassy Knoll, they got away and Jack Ruby killed Oswald to shut him up. Maybe a little too convenient. The Warren Commission report came out only one year later, not enough time to sort out everything. The Church hearings were too open to get the real stuff beyond salacious sex. Secret CIA/FBI investigations might have been the only real answer, and who knows, maybe they were conducted, and maybe the gullible public cannot handle the truth. Who knows? Not Oliver Stone.

97327,5,0790729733,"They say that the third time's the charm and this certainly applies to the latest DVD version of Oliver Stone's film, JFK. Previous incarnations included a movie-only edition spread over two sides of a single disc and an extras-packed two DVD set, part of the Oliver Stone Collection that came out a few years ago. What's new on this one? Aside from all the extras from the last version, only a feature-length documentary and that's it.
All of the extras on the previous edition are included as is one new addition, a 90-minute documentary entitled, ""Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy."" It uses Stone's film as a jumping off point in which to revisit the events of and surrounding the assassination and examine the cult of conspiracy theorists. There is some fantastic on the set footage of Stone in action and interviews with most of the star-studded cast. Detractors of the film (Walter Cronkite and a film critic from The New York Times) and its supporters (Robert MacNeil from the MacNeil/Lehr Report) are interviewed, providing an excellent snapshot of the controversy that swirled around the film at the time. This is an excellent, in-depth documentary that even includes interviews with Marina Oswald and fascinating archival footage of the real Oswald, including his infamous death on live TV at the hands of Jack Ruby.
For casual fans of the film who already own the Oliver Stone Collection version, buying this new one probably isn't really worth it. For hardcore fans of JFK and Stone, the inclusion of this impressive documentary is worth the price of purchase. For completists, however, one glaring omission is AMC's excellent episode of Backstory that was done on the making of the film. Perhaps this will be included on yet another future edition of this film. That being said, this is a solid two DVD set for a landmark film.

1.  If Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin, he could have gotten 3 shots off in time.  Real life snipers have proven it with the gun found in the School Book Depository.

2.  Jack Ruby didn't place the bullet on the Texas Governor's strecher.  In the movie, he wasn't wearing gloves (check me if I'm wrong).  There would be fingerprints.  No fingerprints were found on the bullet.

3.  If there was a ""Magic Bullet"" it didn't go right, left right, left, etc.  The Texas governor was sitting 3 inches below Kennedy, closer to the door than Kennedy, he was a little wider than Kennedy.  There are a few other differences.  This evens out the bullet.  The bullet has a straight path through both bodies.

4.  The last speech by Jim Garrison (the long one right before the jury voted) he never said.

5.  There were not 6-8 shots fired.  A police officer accidentally left his recorder running on his motercycle.  It recorded exactly 3 shots, not 6-8 shots.

Jim Garrison raised about the Kennedy Assassination in his book ""On The Trail of the Assassins.""  This film is a tour-de-force by Oliver Stone, and was very controversial for mixing new footage with real archived film clips in a way that many felt would only mislead the uninformed.  They have a point - some details of the arguments here don't hold up to careful scrutiny (truly interested persons should check out other sources, such as Gerald Posner's ""Case Closed"") but the amazing thing about this film is that in just a few hours, it gives an amazingly rich ""crash course"" in the controversies surrounding the assassination investigation.  It successfully conveys Garrison's point of view as a well-intentioned professional who descends from a normal sense of early-60s civic pride into a multi-year journey of doubt about U.S. democracy, and anxiety regarding social changes.  The Cold War, Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam, political unrest and assassinations of the 60s...  This is a truly impressive film at relating one man's loss of civic faith, even if you disagree completely with the premises it explores.  It is loaded with stars and cameo appearances.  It can be enjoyed (or studied) again and again.  Particularly notable on the DVD is an interview with Fletcher Prouty, the real version of the film's ""Mr. X"" that encouraged and guided Garrison's suspicions.  Gary Oldman gives a completely knockout performance as Lee Harvey Oswald, and in my opinion this film also contains the best performance I've seen from Kevin Costner!  Surely only its controversy kept this from Best Picture Oscar possibilities.  What an amazing piece of filmmaking!

97341,4,0790729733,"Oliver Stone does an excellent job of arguing the case for a conspiracy in the assassination of JFK. The facts, and some of the unexplained mysteries, all documented, are presented to the viewer in a most compelling way. You come away from the film wondering if there really was a conspiracy.
This movie does not have the feeling of paranoia that most other movies about conspiracy have, and here I am thinking of ""The Enemy of the State"" for example. The calm and rational development of the argument, with more information gradually added distinguishes this work from other more frivolous films. A line in the film which I think is quite telling is that if the assassination had happened in Russia, and the facts were as they are, would the idea of a conspiracy be that hard to swallow. It may be the willingness of the public to disbelieve the possibility of a Government that works against it's people, rather than the lack of facts, which makes conspiracy so difficult to believe for many people.
Even though Stone was true to the facts as he found them (or as others furnished them), he did take artistic license in some areas. This does not make the point that the movie is trying to make any less valid. Any movie about historical events, usually has some sort of creativity in it regarding minor events such as the flawlessness of the speeches, flashbacks, additional dialogues etc...
If you aren't one who buys into Conspiracy but who enjoys a good film, Costner's performance is stunning in this one and won't disappoint. The movie, in it's own right is excellent, and I would highly recommend it for it's own sake.

Did Oswald really pull the trigger that fateful afternoon in Dallas? Perhaps we'll never know. But the film is a potpouri of investigative threads and niche conspiracy theories that, at least for my money, hold more than an ounce of truth. At the very least it shoots holes in the Warren Commission Report which - for anyone who's read it - isn't hard to do.
TRANSFER: This is the same stunning transfer that Warner Brothers gave us several years before as part of the Oliver Stone Collection. It's the director's cut. Colors are rich, fully saturated and well balanced. Black and contrast levels are solid. There is a subtle hint of edge enhancement and minor shimmering of fine details but neither will distract. The audio is 5.1 and powerful on every level.
EXTRAS: Ah, here's the reason for the re-issue: the brilliant documentary, ""Behind The Conspiracy"" which is thought-provoking and chilling; sort of like Einstein meets The Silence of the Lambs. There's also all the DVD-ROM junket stuff that came with the previously issued disc.

97343,5,0790729733,"I love films that teach me to think, and ""JFK"" is one of them.  Reality must always take precedence over ""Official Reports"" or Celebrity Endorsed Statements, and that's what I learned from JFK.  I think it is an ASTOUNDING achievement of cinematography, script, editing, and direction.  The people of superior intelligence and talent who brought all the crucial elements of this true story and film making together at the level witnessed in ""JFK"" have my highest admiration and regards.  This film is an absolute Must-See for an intelligent, enquiring mind.

Now, for some of my own personal ""paranoia"".  There are good persons and there are bad people.  The good persons mind their own business, the bad people try to sell the undecided people the idea that the reason they are doing something bad in a bad way with bad results is for good reasons and a sublime outcome.  Bad people like crucifixions.  They'll stage them.  And they'll stage crucifixions to create a panic, a riot, a fear, an emotional response from a controllable MOB, a mass of people to aim and fire at whatever target they need to benefit their rise to power.

The Warren Commission told the American People it was a madman who committed the Kennedy atrocity, and there was no hyper-hysteria aimed at the people of America that could be Communists, the Mafia, or alleged bigots.  The American People had been defused.  That was the only purpose of the Warren Report.  Now, the defusers are not necessarily the culprits.  The culprits are the ones who wanted chaos in America and race riots and protests (and even suspicion).  The Communists came to power in Russia out of the chaos, political turmoil, and starvation of World War 1.  I also believe they intended to come to power here out of the chaos of assassinations, Vietnam, race-relations and unionism.  The liberalism we experience today is the American Way of avoiding all that.

If we can have crooked Intelligence Officers even as we speak,  in all powerful nations of the globe claiming there are WMDs in Iraq when there weren't any, making Iraq and Saddam out as more powerful than they actually were, hoping to give them more bargaining power when dealing with the U.S., don't you think this same evil element could have existed during the height of the Cold War, that we can have crooked intelligence officers in the 60's with ties to the MOB, the Mafia, the clergy, putting together not one but several assassinations of politically popular figures to go along with an unpopular war, left-educated, doped up college goons and their Marxist ideologies and their Manson-like families of stoned-out flower children.

That the good persons of this nation over came this attack is amazing and speaks of a silent and great group of men who have served us and are not getting the congratulations and adulations they deserve for vanquishing the bad people...repeatedly.  We can't even begin to understand all this until we understand that there are two sides to the equation for all political issues:  Reason vs Faith, Capitalism vs Socialism, and Individualism vs Collectivism.  Reason, Capitalism and Individualism is the good side.(Please read Ayn Rand).

If we were all programmed by our religions and social beliefs to react with a politically correct emotional response anytime the right piano keys were played at the right time, what would happen if the right keys were tinkled the wrong way at the wrong time, is it possible that the bad people who knew our programming could take control away from our elected leaders out of the chaos created by our unrestrained emotions (like Nixon)?  Due to the emotional health and obvious intelligence of the current ""good-persons"" of America, the answer is ""NOT"".

The good persons of America are showing themselves resistant to programming.  But we all know the Bad People will never surrender easily.  Never surrender is their slogan.  They will continue to stir up racial, religious, and sexual tensions to destroy us if we let them.  And their name is Legion for they are many...people, not persons.

Will we let them?  It's up to you.",1078185600,2,4116,4.927431059506532
97344,5,0790729733,"Sorry about the re-write of my review of this film and DVD --- but this is the last revision. Let me start off by saying that I'm not much on film critics. I'm certainly not trying to be one by coming on here and giving my two-cents. However, I do read Roger Ebert's movie reviews, and I try to choose some of the movies from his favorites. Now, most of the time, this never works. But in the case of Oliver Stone's JFK, I agree 100%. It is one of the best films of the 1990's. There I said it. Onto the movie. The movie's screenplay is really written from two books. One entitled 'Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy' (by Jim Marrs) and the other 'On the Trail of the Assassins' (by Jim Garrison). Now to say that this is 100% factual is crazy, but the simple fact of the matter is that we DO NOT know exactly who killed Kennedy (I believe Oswald was involved, but at a lower level) and the facts are that Oswald was shooting from behind the President and if you've watched the Abraham Zapruder film you'll see Kennedy's head go back when the fatal head-shot hit him. Now COMMON SENSE PEOPLE if you're shooting from behind, the impact from the bullet is going to send your head forward --- NOT BACKWARDS. I've just got a High School Diploma and I got enough sense to know that. To say that were NOT a conspiracy is just plain crazy. Four bullets accounted for --- only one riffle --- the only way this assassignation was done was with the help of at least one other person! COMMON SENSE AGAIN! It aggervates me that some people are still living in their fantasy world and don't want to face the truth, but I thinks it's vital for our country to know what really happened --- WE OWE IT TO JOHN KENNEDY. Back to the film, I think Oliver Stone captures exactly how America feels about this subject, even today --- that we're still saddened and some still mourning over the loss of a President who (if lived and served two terms as President) would've gotten out soldiers out of Vietnam about a decade earlier and imagine all the lives that would still be in this world. Any time I'm sitting around watching a war film on the Vietnam War, I feel the pain of those who have lost their loved ones. Oliver Stone ensembles an amazing cast headlined by Kevin Costner and his co-stars include -- Tommy Lee Jones, Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Jack Lemon, Walter Matthau, Vincent D'Onofrio, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight, Laurie Metcalf and Jay O. Sanders. Onto the DVD --- If you own the 'Oliver Stone Collection' Director's Cut of this movie, DO NOT buy this copy. It's the exact same material including the commentary track! If you haven't bought a copy of JFK on DVD then I'd pick it up. The commentary track alone is worth the extra cash. Not to mention the Deleted/Alternate Scenes and the Documentary With ""X"". The Director's Cut contains 17 minutes of un-seen footage, as well. This is a must! I don't want to ruin it for JFK fans, but if you haven't seen the Director's Cut, then I suggest you do so now! Awsome scene where Garrison is met at the Airport and --- well, you'll just have to pick up a copy of this to see. The DVD transfer is excellent as well as the sound (you don't have to hold on to the remote and wait for one scene to out-power the next --- sound-wise). One of the most provocative, mind-bending films ever released, this film will make you beg for more!",1075939200,2,3428,4.408517350157728
97345,5,0790729733,"It would be real cozy if Oswald had just been a disturbed individual who didn't get enough love and attention as a child, as in the Peter Gabriel song Family Snapshot, but alas, that might be an over-simplification.
Whatever you think about the Conspiracy/No Conspiracy battle, anybody should be able to appreciate this stunning movie, as a movie, which features a performance by Kevin Costner that is basically as good as it gets.
I won't repeat the rightful praise heaped on the movie by other reviewers, except to say that every good thing you have heard about this masterpiece is true.
As for the Conspiracy itself, the movie contains a few elements that may have arguably been discredited but on the whole, it asks a lot of questions that have never been satisfactorily answered. After the shameful whitewash attempt by author Gerald Posner, 'Case Closed' (gotta love his arrogance) JFK is like a breath of fresh air.
Personally, I didn't like or trust Kennedy, so I don't have a political axe to grind by aligning myself with the Pro-Conspiracy side. It's just that there is enough questionable data to make any reasonable person doubt the official explanations.
Gerald Posner's utterly laughable 'explanation' of the second shot as being a reflex action, in which JFK's head suddenly jerked backwards, is all you need to hear to know that the level of intelligence of the anti-Conspiracy side is enough to give Homer Simpson a superiority complex.
Olly Stone has got so much right here that the actual fine detail is almost irrelevant. He has gone a long way towards proving that a complex Conspiracy did in fact exist, and that's without including some of the most extreme (though not ridiculous) theories.
Just enjoy JFK as a piece of Art, because thanks to Stone, Costner and a stunning cast, that is what it is.",1075939200,5,1822,4.861736334405145
97346,3,0790729733,"The problem with this film is the character of Jim Garrison and especially the final scene where's he realises he's bundled the Clay Shaw prosecution and tries to get a 'guilty' verdict by making a speech about American Citizenship instead.  Shoddy lawman if you ask me.  He's not much of a father either.  His family sit in the courtroom at the end of the movie looking up to Garrison like he's some kind of hero and as if he was right to ignore them and treat them badly but he loses the case because of his own amateurishness not because of any judicial conspiracy.  Not much of a pay-off for his kids who've had to amuse themselves for a couple of years while their dad has his head buried in books.  I can't help thinking if it had been Atticus Finch he would have won the court case -and- been good to his family.
On the evidence Stone gives, it is possible to see Garrison as a courageous investigator but not as a rigorous or accomplished lawyer.  This for me definitely takes away from any of the points he's trying to make.  The Donald Sutherland theory is a little bit too much to swallow as well.  Most of the other people who have written about the JFK murder stop short of implicating Lyndon Johnson.
It's a shame because it's obviously such a landmark movie, accomplished in so many ways and Stone ruins it by staying so true to the District Attorney.  Maybe this was part of the book deal but I would have preferred to see Stone be a bit harder on him.",1074211200,,1468,4.347985347985348
97347,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is a brave, powerful, radical film. It's also scary as hell. The movie explores our collective national nightmare about the assassination of the President and its potential links to Castro, the Mob, the CIA, and of course Vietnam and the Military-Industrial Complex. It does not merely suggest that a great evil befell our country that horrible day in 1963, but shouts it from the rooftops. How Stone ever got this movie made is beyond me. But I'm glad he did.
""JFK"" is first and foremost a movie. It is not a documentary and it is not journalism. I agree with critics and others who find its value in its willingness to confront such a difficult subject and exhort its audience to question authority, use their ""eyes and ears and good sense."" Did Oliver Stone convince me that Lee Harvey Oswald did not, in fact, act alone -- that none other than Lyndon Johnson and military defense contractors were in fact behind the assassination? Not necessarily. But this movie intrigued me and scared me and got me to thinking, and that is really the highest compliment I can pay a Hollywood film. Most movies are interested in only one thing: money. This one is interested in ideas, enlightenment, and seeking out the truth. That alone makes ""JFK"" a rarity.
Besides all that, it's a terrific piece of filmmaking, period. I'm not a big fan of Oliver Stone, but what he pulled off here is remarkable. ""JFK"" feels like a combination of Hitchcock and Spielberg, with maybe a little Brian De Palma and Frank Capra thrown in. From the photography to the sound to the editing, it's a masterwork, vivid and alive. Though there is a lot of dialogue -- and two scenes that amount to soliloquies of Shakespearean depth -- Stone never bogs down, never loses steam, never loses his train of thought. The whole movie builds up to a climactic courtroom sequence that pulls all the threads together into a picture of what MIGHT have happened in Dallas that day. It then leaves us to think, and ask questions, and keep our own eyes open.
I want to mention three of the actors. First, Tommy Lee Jones, who is seductively evil as Clay Shaw/Bertrand. He deserved to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year, but of course there's no justice in that ceremony. Second, Joe Pesci, panicky and devilish as David Ferrie -- here's a whirlwind performance that dwarfs his fast-talking work in ""Lethal Weapon 2."" Finally, Kevin Costner, turning in a powerful portrayal of Jim Garrison. Costner is in almost every scene, sometimes just watching and listening, but always credible in a role that took a lot of guts for him to play (after all, he is Stone's mouthpiece for a lot of highly unpopular ideas). Anyone who doubts Costner's acting ability has obviously never seen this film.
There are disturbing moments, many of them highlighted by pungent dialogue that gets right to the point. Donald Sutherland gets the movie's most gripping scene, walking Costner through all of ""the facts"" behind the assassination (it's a brilliant scene -- Garrison almost literally shuts down, he's so overwhelmed by what he's hearing). Lines like ""subtle as a cockroach crawling across a white carpet,"" ""it's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma"" and ""people like you just walk between the raindrops"" have a strangely chilling effect; simple lines that cast the drama in a sinister light.
Look, I realize that Stone altered some of the facts to fit his cinematic story (Ferrie, for instance, did not die under such suspicious circumstances). I know that the movie is not unbiased -- that it's a bald representation of the ideas of the man behind it. So what? Here is a movie that takes more risks than any other, before or since. It has flaws, but they are minor. ""JFK"" was the best film of 1991 and stands as one of my favorites ... disturbing though it may be.",1071446400,4,3845,4.740298507462686
97348,5,0790729733,"No matter which side of the fence you're on regarding the JFK assassination, Oliver Stone's JFK is a provocative and frightening film which, as critic David Denby said, ""would scare God."" Critics have said that the film ought to be dismissed because it manipulates facts and history. Well, okay, but the same could be said about TORA! TORA! TORA!, THE LONGEST DAY, and PATTON, but the critics were strangely silent about the liberties those filmmakers took with history. And although there is no mistaking what Stone thinks happened on 11/22/63, Kevin Costner, as Jim Garrison, repeats countless times, ""Let us speculate..."", ""We can assume..."", ""What if..."". This is a movie about speculating, and about the frightful implications of the possible results.

As others have mentioned, most of the casting and the performances are perfect. For my money, though, nothing beats British-born Gary Oldman's convincing portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald. I was stunned by his brilliance. Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Cissy Spacek, and the dozens of other cameos were equally beyond amazing (although, at times, Joe Pesci sounded more like he was from New Jersey than New Orleans). In this edition of the film are scenes that were edited out from the version released in theatres, and you'll easily understand why. They aren't bad scenes at all (the scene of John LaRoquette and Mort Sahl as thinly disguised Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon is very good) but they don't add much to the story. The accompanying documentary ""Beyond JFK"" is interesting but flat when compared with Stone's film. Still it's worth a view.

The real stars of this show, however, are Oliver Stone's meticulous direction, Robert Richardson's eerie and engaging cinematography (for which he won an Oscar), and the frenetic editing job by Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia (also Oscar winners). This team flawlessly paces this three-hour film: rushing it up at the dramatic moments, cooling it down when the audience needs to digest the data. Like Scorsese's RAGING BULL, the filmmakers employ several types of cameras and films, moving from dolly shots to hand-held, color to black-and-white, grainy to clean. The effect is a dazzling and haunting recreation of what may have happened in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963 and what that day did to those, like Jim Garrison, who attempted to find the truth.",1071014400,10,2362,5.10077519379845
97349,4,0790729733,"JFK provides quite a dramatic viewpoint of several conspiracy theories surrounding the assination of John F. Kennedy.  First of all, I'd like to say that I know basically nothing about the actual details of the assination, so I can't say for sure how much of this movie is acurate to the historical fact.  However, I can say that it features a stunning preformance by Kevin Costner as investigator Jim Garrison and the movie pays much on the drama of the further investigation of the death of the president.  Overall, I thought that the movie opened America's eyes to the possibility of conspiracys surrounding the government.  The depiction of Oswald as being a ""patsy"" is one of the focal points of the film and it weaves a web of conspiracies involving Cuban guerrilla influences, Communism, and even questions about the American government's role in Kennedy's death.  The movie cultivates with the trial of Shaw.  The trial scene is where the intensity of the movie reaches its climax and although its depiction really does show how little of an actual case Garrison had on Shaw, it passionately attempts to unravel some of the mysteries involving the death of the president.  ""The magic bullet"" evidence really makes you believe that there has to have been at least some cover up of the details involving that famous day in Texas.  If anything, this movie brings the case into the spotlight, even if it will remain to be shadowed by some doubt.
There are, however, some problems with the movie.  Other reviewers have stated that many facts have been juggled in order to create a believable story, and I'm sure that this is true.  It is unlikely that a number of the cut scences actually took place in their entiretity.  Also, some of the ""star studed actors"" that were featured in the film seemed to be playing roles that were not suited well for them.  Joe Pesci seemed miscast and John Candy's character was almost laughable in such a serious movie.  Finally, the movie is about three hours long and seems to drag in some places.  I haven't seem the un-cut version, but I can't really see why the extra material in the directors cut is really needed.  So many conspiracies are tossed around that after awhile, some of them to disprove each other.
Overall, JFK may not be most perfect movie and probably did bend the facts a little, but it is worth seeing at least once.  If you don't want to wade through the whole movie, skip to the trial scence because it is the best part of the film.",1070409600,,2494,4.672768878718536
97360,5,0790729733,"I'm surprised, after 40 years, that so much effort is still made to discredit Jim Garrison's investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy and Oliver Stone's telling movie ""JFK"".
Peter Jennings and ABC made a ""heroic"" effort to convince viewers that Oswald was a ""lone nut"" assassin. Even PBS sold out with their ""Frontline"" program, and a couple of others, about the JFK assassination.
As someone who has studied the JFK assassination, as an avocation, since 1968, I highly recommend Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" as an excellent starting point to understanding why Kennedy was assassinated.
Stone had to abbreviate the story. How could any film cover everything that happened from before Kennedy took the oath of office in January of 1961 until the trial of Clay Shaw in 1969 in a couple of hours? It isn't possible unless some artistic license is taken. An example is ""X"", the mysterious military colonel, who was based on more than one person but primarily on Col. L. Fletcher Prouty (who wrote the excellent book ""JFK: The CIA, Vietnam and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy"". The conversation, in the film ""JFK"", between ""X"" and District Attorney Jim Garrison, never took place. But it precisely summed up events which happened over a long period of time in the planning and execution of the assassination. If not for these kinds of artistic license a movie spanning nearly nine years would have to be several years long to include all details exactly as they happened.
The jury in the Clay Shaw trial believed there was a conspiracy, they just didn't have the proof they needed to convict Shaw. And it was no wonder they couldn't. The FBI, CIA and many other government entities did everything they could to thwart Garrison's investigation. His offices were bugged, ""volunteers"" removed stacks of documents, The FBI threatened his investigators, witnesses were murdered, Governors refused to extradite key witnesses, the judge wouldn't allow the police officer who booked Clay Shaw to testify that Shaw said he used the alias Clay Bertrand when being booked ... no D.A. could win a case under those circumstances. Even Johnny Carson, on NBC's ""The Tonight Show"", attacked Garrison over national television.
Garrison did a remarkable job, under the circumstances, of coming close to solving the assassination. Garrison's book ""On The Trail of the Assassins: My Investigation and Prosecution of the Murder of President Kennedy"" illustrates exactly what he was up against in bringing Clay Shaw to trial. If you can find this book buy it.
Why is the Kennedy assassination of any importance 40 years later? You have to understand what happened then to understand what has happened since. Why would the government, the media, authors, television program producers and others want to make you belive a lone nut assassin killed our President? Why did so many witnesses die so quickly? Why was evidence destroyed and modified? Why was Oswald silenced by Jack Ruby? Why was Oswald given Russian language training while in the Marines, sent to work at the largest CIA military base in Asia, then allowed to ""defect"" to Russia? Why would our government stand by and do nothing when Oswald tells the U.S. Embassy that he wants to give up his U.S. citizenship and says he is going to give Russia secrets about our U2 flights? Why would he be allowed to do that? Why, when he wanted to come back to the U.S., was he promptly given his passport, never debriefed, and even given travel money by a CIA cover group? Why wouldn't he be charged with treason? Why did Oswald pretend to be pro-Castro working out of the office of Guy Banister, a private investigator who was former ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) and former head of the Chicago office of the F.B.I.? Why would Oswald hang out in a place within a couple of blocks of the Secret Service, the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the O.N.I. offices in New Orleans if he had truly defected to Russia? Was Oswald being set up to be the ""patsy"" for the assassination? Why didn't the Warren Commission take Jack Ruby to Washington, D.C. where he said he could tell the truth? Why did Ruby suddenly contract a virulent form of colon cancer in his lungs just after being told he would get a re-trial? He claimed he was being injected with cancer and he died within a couple of months. Why would JFK's brain disapper from the National Archives along with autopsy photos? Why did LBJ have the limousine flown to Ford Motor Company and the windshield with a bullet hole removed and destroyed, as well as the carpet and parts of the interior replaced destroying that evidence. These, and hundreds of other questions, will come up as you watch ""JFK"" and do some searching on the internet.",1070236800,26,4720,4.857320099255583

I become interested in the JFK case when I first seen this film in the theatre back in '91. I was really impressed by this film. Film has it's own langusge and Oliver Stone is a master of using film to tell a story. This is one of the most engrossing films to watch. It should be studied by film schools and used as a bible on the art of becoming a movie director. I SENSE STONE believes there's a conspircy and cover-up. And a clue leads me to think a general LANSDALE played a important part. All the actors were very good but I was especially impressed  by John Candy as Dean Andrews and Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw. I love this film and think its a one of our great american films but there's one or two flaws. First as much as  I love Joe Pesci I think he overdid the David Ferry  part. He comes off as a ranting clown. Also some of family comes of  f bad in diologue. I know Oliver used some F-words so Jim Garrison doesn't come off as  a flawless saint. I wish he could of been more

97363,5,0790729733,"The beauty of Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is that it has and will for a long time still, engender a mass of hate, love, incomprehension and good old America debate.
Just this last week, being the 40th Anniversary of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, there were two documentaries televised: one supported the claim of the lone gunman theory and the findings of the Warren Commission while the other supported the two+ gunman conspiracy theory with all the attendant evidence in support. Is there any wonder that we as a Nation have no idea what/who/why happened on November 22, 1963 in Dallas? Stone's ""JFK"" seems heavily dependent on the second 7 hour BBC produced documentary (ridiculous in that it is better researched that the Warren Commission!) for many of it's facts, though the BBC program looked at Jim Garrison's contribution to the investigation as a sidelight not the main event.
Be all of that as it may, this film is a lollapalooza: a fascinating, dramatic, though obviously slanted look at what was the most important and riveting event in American history until 9/11. And Stone does a tremendously effective job of marshalling all of the facts, fiction and theories into a dramatic whole. This is not a documentary, this is a film based on fact.  And since the only fact we all can all agree on is that someone shot JFK in Dallas on 11/22/63, it seems to me that everything else is open to speculation and interpretation.
Kevin Costner gives a bravura performance as Jim Garrison: a man so conflicted and so troubled by the assassination that he feels compelled to bring someone to trial for it. His summation scene, which goes on for nearly 45 minutes towards the end of ""JFK"" is so moving, so strongly felt, so incisively acted, so emotionally aware that we actually see Costner underneath the performance as Garrison: the third wall is removed and it is Costner not only speaking to us, he is speaking for us.
We will never know exactly what happened in Dallas on that Friday afternoon 40 years ago, but we do have this film and Costner's performance as a reminder of what can happen when someone of intelligence and foresight tackles a problem and proposes a hypothesis: right or wrong is not the issue, making the effort is.",1069632000,,2249,4.781491002570694
97364,5,0790729733,"sure, he's taken real life events and fictionalzied some characters and there alleged involvement with the assisination. most directors have creative license to make a movie that is more compelling to its audience. so the scripted words in JFK are not historically accurate.
what Mr. Stone manages to do is make swiss cheese out of the Warren Commission report. after viewing this movie, it appears to me that this report is the biggest work of ""non-fictionalized"" fiction ever written. many questions are posed that are not easliy answered. IMO the report isn't worth the paper it's printed on, with the exception of buttwipe.
this movie really is a remarkable achievement. kudos to OS for not scrapping the project after the original JFK script was stolen during filming/production....",1069632000,,787,5.2047244094488185
97365,5,0790729733,"You have to approach Oliver Stone's JFK in two ways: first as a motion picture, then as a representation of history.  It is often hard to separate the two, but one must never forget that this is a movie, a dramatization that features a number of added fictional elements to make it more poignant and gripping.  How true a representation of Garrison's life and work is this?  I can't say for sure, as I have focused most of my attention on the work and ideas of a number of other dedicated researchers, having always regarded Garrison's case as tangential at best.  Garrison, even with a little fictional help from Oliver Stone, never had much of a case against Clay Shaw, but the evidence he puts forth in his unwinnable case does, to my mind, satisfactorily prove that there was a conspiracy involving unknown individuals to kill the President.  Still, though, this is an over dramatized production wherein a number of facts are tweaked, created, changed, or deleted; Garrison is a controversial figure who comes off much better here than he does in real life, so one can certainly not accept this film as fact.  I have read and studied the JFK assassination at some length, and I consider Garrison's case an interesting but rather small, gnarled limb on the tree of conspiracy; there are a number of far larger and weightier limbs on that tree, and when these are eventually hacked down and fall at the foot of the American people, the whole world will be rocked by the force and immensity of the event, and the reverberations of that fall will echo throughout all of our future history.
JFK succeeds admirably as a movie.  The blending together of actual footage and historical re-creations in a sometimes almost surreal way is very effective, the humanity, passion, and integrity of Jim Garrison shines out like a beacon of truth, and Garrison's passionate closing argument is emotionally powerful and believable.  The film is rather graphic, but it has to be.  One of the reasons I bought this movie when it came out was its inclusion of the Zapruder film, the key piece of evidence that, among other things, shows the horrible force and destruction of the kill shot.  Autopsy scenes and photos, both real and re-created, may also be disturbing to some, but they are historically accurate.  The film features an incredible number of well-known actors and actresses: Kevin Costner, whom I don't really like as a general rule, delivers a truly powerful performance; Sissy Spacek is certainly convincing as Garrison's annoying, emotionally torn wife; Brian Doyle-Murray makes a convincing Jack Ruby; and Gary Oldman simply is Lee Harvey Oswald.  An almost unrecognizable Tommy Lee Jones brings Clay Shaw to memorable life, but the finest performance here, in my opinion, is that of Joe Pesci in his role of the unforgettable real-life character David Ferrie.  Great actors such as Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Walter Matthau, and Kevin Bacon are brilliant in small yet important roles.  Jim Garrison himself even makes an appearance as, of all people, Earl Warren.
JFK doesn't have very many answers, but it asks a lot of the right questions.  The one problem this film has, though, is the fact that it covers so much information and characters.  Those who have not studied the assassination in any depth before, those who have not read such material as Stone drew heavily from (principally Jim Marrs' Crossfire and the research of Robert Groden), may find themselves a little overwhelmed by too much information, much of it presented in the form of rapid-fire dialogue and dream-like video montages.
This movie, much like Garrison's case, spread the word to the public at large; it exposed the shadows of dark, mysterious forces whose possible connection to the assassination has never been fully explored; it tore down the incredibly shaky conclusion of the Warren Commission; it pointed fingers not so much at individuals and groups of possible conspirators as it pointed the finger of truth at the American public.  We all deserve to know the truth about Kennedy's assassination, and it is up to us to demand and get that proof, to tear down the walls of secrecy and confidentiality behind which what is left of the evidence lies, to take our country back from the kinds of men who would engineer a brutal public murder and then secretly change the entire course of our great republic for the worse.  I think that anyone who looks at this case will know that the government has lied to us all for the past forty years.  That's not really the point of this film, though.  JFK compels you to look at the evidence yourself, it exhorts you not to take the government at its word without sufficient proof, and it expresses the qualities a great nation must rediscover if it is to prosper in the future.",1069459200,5,4828,4.8432563791008505

If everything in this movie were fiction, it would still rank as one of the great political thrillers.  This superior piece of filmmaking that looks behind the mirror at the moment in American culture when our collective paradigm truly shifted.  Highest recommendation.",1069372800,2,930,5.03921568627451

The only problem with this film is that the viewer is not sure if everything that is presented as fact, really is fact and not the invention of Stone for dramatic affect.",1069113600,2,370,4.522388059701493

The new stuff was cool, and it came much later than when the DVD was originally released. However, this is the third JFK DVD to be released already. How many more should we expect. What makes this one anymore special than the Director's Cut. I appreciate trying to get as much stuff on the DVD as you can, but why could it not have been done on the second one. These DVDs are becoming like computers, as soon as you buy on you better beware because a new, sleeker model will soon be on the way.
It boggles my mind!!!",1068681600,10,729,4.251798561151079
97369,3,0790729733,"The movie ""JFK"" is a slick piece of movie making, for which I grudglingly give it 3 stars, but it is NOT history. It lionizes Jim Garrison as if he were a hero, when he was anything but. Garrison had no credible evidence, changed theories more often than he changed his shirt, and relied on a cast of witnesses that would make the average county jail population look like the Chamber of Commerce by comparison. He proceeded to railroad forward a prosecution of Clay Shaw that was so transparent it became a national embarrasment. When the case went to trial, it was not Garrison who courageously argued it in court (like the movie depicts). He assigned that suicide mission to his deputies. He had started his investigation in early 1966, arrested Shaw over a year later in March 1967, then took nearly two more years to get the case to trial. He thus had over three years to investigate and assemble his proof, but when it finally went to the jury, the evidence was so insubstantial that in 45 minutes (and just one ballot) they acquitted Shaw. For a prosecutor, that's like getting pantsed in a Louisiana downpour.  One juror later reported they would have been back in half the time, but a few of them needed to use the restroom before returning to court.
Stone (a gifted film maker) took Garrison's fantasy, then ""dramatized"" (changed) some of the facts, and created others, to make things seem more plausible. For example, the Donald Sutherland character in the film didn't even exist (check Garrison's book).  Also, Stone portrays supposed witness David Ferrie as being forced to ingest something which kills him -- a murder.  Garrison's original theory on Ferrie's death was suicide (he developed more sinister explanations later).  In fact, Ferrie died of natural causes due to a type of brain aneurysm that is impossible to fake or induce.  But that doesn't make good drama.
The resulting film is fiction based on fiction. It has the same relationship to actual history that the Jerry Springer Show has to investigative journalism.  A slick movie, for which I give it 3 stars, but in its underlying premise and point, pure fiction.",1068422400,8,2140,4.801630434782608
97380,5,0790729733,"This is one of the all-time great movies.
First, even if you don't buy the entire conspiracy as presented by Stone, it is a wonderful lesson in US history and politics and citizenship.
Second, it is just wonderfully entertaining.  The cast is superb.  Not only is it all-star, but Stone has somehow managed to cast against type and get wonderful performances.  He casts Ed Asner, a liberal in real life, as a stone-age murderous rightwing fruitcake.  He casts rockjawed Tommy Lee Jones as the swishy effeminate Clay Shaw.  He casts usually tough-as-nails self-sufficient Sissy Spacek as timid hausfrau Mrs. Garrison.  He casts Kevin Costner, real-life rightwinger, as partisan of JFK and nemesis of the Military Industrial Complex.  He even casts Jim Garrison himself as Earl Warren, the Supreme Court Justice who denounces Jim Garrison!
And they all deliver wonderful performances.  So does almost everybody in the movie.
I believe that Oswald was not solely guilty, that there must have been some kind of wider gallery of shooters.  But unlike Stone, I don't think the killing of one president, however charismatic, really did change or really could change US history much.  The US is an oligarchy, of by and for the wealthy, and that isn't likely to change.
But the movie is wonderfully inspiring, and almost Capraesque in its faith in democracy.  Everyone, particularly those too young to have witnessed Kennedy's death, should see it.",1067904000,4,1439,5.1068376068376065
97381,5,0790729733,"JFK is a brilliant and indepth story about the day America cried. What this movie does not do is tell you what you already know about 22/11/1963, but rather the evidence New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner, in a wonderful performance) stumbles across and slowly pieces together to create the greatest conspiraacy theory man has ever known, including that of the Lunar landing in 1969 never happening!?!
Director Oliver Stone takes what facts are already known about the assassination, as well as informed guesses, and weaves them smootly into the story of the investigation that occurred several years after JFK died. They include the 'magic bullet' theory, Mr X and the military's involvement, and the underworld connections of the CIA.
This two-DVD set also includes a very interesting commentary by Stone, where he talks about his interest in Kennedy's murder and the attention to detail in the movie.
The documentaries are interesting to watch once, after you've seen the film, but are useless otherwise as they are complicated and repeat issues addressed in the film.
Kevin Costner is wonderful as Jim Garrison, showing how the man cared more about a murder mystery than his family and the lives of his employees.
For those relatively unfamilar with the details of JFK's death, such as myself being an Australian teen, it is easy to understand why people still want answers and why they haven't got them yet.
Also, for fans of legal dramas or with a passion for the law it is very interesting to watch the trial of a businessman connected to an anti-communist, as Garrison continually brings evidence into play.
An outstanding film about an unforgettable time in history, put together by the master of historical dramas, Oliver Stone. For people with an interest in JFK's assassination, or modern history, this DVD is a must-have.",1066348800,4,1842,5.022875816993464
97382,1,0790729733,"I have no love for this film and i have no love for JFK as either man or President.  I've watched this film several times including when it was playing in the theatre that i owned. The dumming down of America started with JFK.  Why were people impressed and why do people even care who shot him?  I was about 16 when he was killed,,,it had no impact on me at all.  Actually anyone who was brought up properly would of had the same reaction as i did but somehow that generation of people fell in love with basically a sex symbol to many women and men loved him because he appeared to be athletic and said things that they thought was impressive.  The famous quote ""Ask not what the country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."" I love this country and i believe in taking care of this country but that stupid statement was the start of bring in the new order of corrupt political leaders and has put us in the worse shape we have ever been in.  I'm not talking about anything outside of the walls of the US.  I'm talking about the United States low class thinking, uneducated kids, trailer trash type of attitude when it comes to sports heros, the what's in it for me thinking. Yes people you can thank one jerk for the start of this and his name was JFK.",1066262400,5,1271,4.184426229508197
97383,5,0790729733,"The Lunar Landing. The Hindenburg. Stock market crash of 1929. Titanic. Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech and finally JFK's assassination in 1963. What do these things have in common? They're moments in history that everyone remembers, researches and studies. So much has happened in the past 100 years but these events and others just like it actually happened and they're part of American history. The difference between the assassination and the rest? It's a controversy, it's a mystery. It's something that can't be explained unlike the others.
November 22nd, 1963. Dallas, Texas. Dealey Plaza. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in his motorcade during a visit. The suspect: Lee Harvey Oswald. The main investigator: Jim Garrison. The film follows Garrison and his investigation into the assassination and what proves to be the mystery of all mysteries.
This film will make you think. Why? Because the explanation by the government(called the Magic Bullet Theory, your first clue that the government had something to do with it) is wrong, and they explain why. Why Oswald could not have performed the shooting alone and they explain why. Director Oliver Stone delves deep into this and literally rips things apart. A lot of it is speculation and theories but that's the whole point, to keep you thinking and to raise questions.
All in all, a controversial but brilliantly constructed attempt to show that what happened that day near 40 years ago is deeper and more complicated than what you were told by the big boys in Washington",1064880000,4,1554,5.07421875
97384,1,0790729733,Oh my goodness this is a bad film. There aren't any gnomes. What in the world!?!?!?!? Show me the money! watch jerry miguire instead. It is more truthful to the jfk assassination than this movie.,1064880000,7,195,4.6
97385,5,0790729733,"Now that some time has passed and the dust has settled, JFK can be looked at as a movie that is NOT historically accurate portrayl of what went down on that fateful day in Dallas, but rather an engaging, nail-biting thriller.
Whether you agree or disagree with Stone's view, there is no disputing the craftsmenship that went into this film. The use of multiple film stocks that create layers upon layers of interpretation of the events depicted. The editing alone is masterful as Stone juggles many subplots at once. Robert Richardson's cinematography is incredible (there's a reason why he won the Academy Award that year) and has become Stone's signature look.
And there is the cast: Kevin Costner does a fine job as the Gary Cooper-ish Jim Garrison who doggedly pursues his investigation. From here on in, there is a staggering who's who of big name and character actors filling in major and minor roles: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Vincent D'Onofrio, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, and the list goes on. Everybody does a great job and give the film an authenticity and believability.
This new, 2-DVD set is a HUGE improvement over the old, single flipper-disc. The entire movie (Stone's preferred cut) is now on one side and included is a fascinating audio commentary by Stone who manages to keep it going for the entire running time! His commentaries have always been a real treat to listen to and he does not disappoint on this one.
The highlight of disc two is a nice collection of deleted and extended scenes with commentary by Stone. It's pretty obvious why they were cut but nice that he included them.
This is a DVD that should be in every movie lover's collection. It's an important work and a cinematic landmark. It's influence can be felt in the TV show, 24 and the made-for-TV movie, The Pentagon Papers. I would also recommend picking up the annotated screenplay to the film which acts as the perfect companion to the film.",1064275200,8,1963,4.776470588235294
97386,5,0790729733,"If you want to know what really happened in 11,22,1963, watch it, or read the book.
The movie is exciting, Oliver Stone presents the picture in a way that is so easy to understand, and he gives us all the facts, and makes the conspiracy theory easy-enough to follow. This movie will make you question everything - do the CIA and FBI have a hold over the President of the biggest countries in the world? If the said President stands up for his own beliefs, is he in danger of his very life? ""JFK"" tells us the answer is ""yes"",
At the beginning, there is a short biography of JFK and we can see him young.
In addition, the film has phenomenal performances by Kevin Costner  as Jim Garrison, Sissy Spacek as Garrison's long-suffering wife, Joe Pesci as David Ferrie), and Donald Sutherland. In addition to these fine performances are Tommy Lee Jones.

In the beginning there is a short biography and we can see young JFK.

97388,5,0790729733,"This film is capable of far more than simply entertaining it's viewers for a few hours. For me, this film evoked one of the strongest emotional reactions I've ever had to a movie. This film will leave you in a cognitive, and perhaps even betrayed, state of mind.
First, I would like to point out that I am fully aware that this film is not entirely factual. I understand that some liberties were taken with the way that the historical events actually unfolded, but that doesn't mean that it's completely false. While this movie is a work of fiction, there is a great deal of true information that accompanies the aforementioned fiction. From what I understand, Stone did not intend this film to be taken as entirely factual, but instead for the viewer to get the overall message that it's important not to believe everything the government tells you just because it's what the government tells you. As the character Jim Garrison says in the movie (I'm paraphrasing here), all it takes is a few corrupt individuals with power to perpetuate a massive lie. I think that this is something that all would do well to remember for the next time the government, or any one else for that matter, proposes a questionable story, such as the non sense one shooter/magic bullet theory.
Now that the history vs. fiction aspect is out of the way, onto the movie itself. I can honestly say that this is one of the most solid movies I've ever seen. From direction, to acting, to writing, to editing, this movie is absolutely remarkable. I personally believe it to be Oliver Stone's finest cinematic offering to date, with Natural Born Killers coming in at an extremely close second.
The film features an ensemble cast who all turn in fantastic performances, especially Gary Oldman and Kevin Costner. Costner's portrayal of Jim Garrison is entertaining and wholly believable. Gary Oldman also gives a fantastic performance as Lee Harvey Oswald, he truly manages to capture the character. The rest of the cast is also very good. Micheal Rooker, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, and Donald Sutherland all provide great supporting performances. Donald Sutherland is terrific as Garrison's CIA insider source. His speech he gives while walking in the park is one of the finest points in the movies. I also liked John Candy's performance as Jim's friend from law school who had been asked to be Oswald's attorney. He was one character I don't think we saw enough of.
Stone's direction here is also incredible. He does a marvelous job at depicting society's reaction to the assassination of JFK. Many are saddened by the loss while others are thrilled by the idea of removing a ""Castro sympathizer"" from the highest office in the country. Stone is also very adept at 'taking the viewer along for the ride', for lack of a better phrase. The deeper into the conspiracy Garrison goes, the deeper you go and I at least felt as though I were there every step of the way, until the final courtroom seen where the viewer is put more in the position of the jury than in the position Garrison.
The editing in this film is remarkable as well. Splicing of black and white footage into the film as well as the use of 35 mm footage is genious. I can't imagine the amount of time and work that must've gone into the editing process of this movie. I think that's it's probably the best I've ever seen.
The writing is also phenomenal. The script is very well researched and the dialog is very absorbing. The conversations are informational, but not to the point that they become boring. I think the writers managed to strike a nice balance in that respect.
But even with all that aside, even without the great editing, directing, and writing, the film still works on a personal level. The JFK era may be well before my time, but I can still identify with Garrison's quest for justice and truth. I think that Garrison's desire for honesty is the real universal message hear, and I think that it's something all viewers will be able to identify with. The need for truth is something that humanity will always have, and I think that through that need this film will live on for a very long time.",1056326400,2,4156,4.6789617486338795
97389,5,0790729733,"This film is based on Jim Garrison's book, which tells of his investigation into the conspiracy. JG joined the National Guard in 1940, served five years in Army artillery, went to law school, joined the FBI, went home to New Orleans, and was elected District Attorney (3 terms) and then a judge. The controversy around this movie is due to Oliver Stone's dramatization of the facts. In one scene DA Garrison points out that LH Oswald's Camp St. address was across from the FBI, the CIA, and Naval Intelligence. At that point in time the offices of the FBI and CIA were a few blocks away. But the point is dramatically made: the ""Fair Play for Cuba Committee"" was practically underfoot. Who was watching them?

I think it was a mistake to cast Ed Asner as the private detective who was former Naval Intelligence, former FBI. Efrem Zimbalist JR had a better resemblance. Walter Matthau played Senator Russell Long. The movie generally follows the book. DA Garrison hears of the connection to David Ferrie, and turns him over to the FBI; nothing happened. A few years later he talks to Senator Long and learns of his doubts on the Warren Report. JG then opens his own investigation into any crime committed in New Orleans. When his secret investigation is uncovered, the corporate media vilify his operation. There was NO cooperation from either J Edgar Hoover, President LBJ, or government agencies. The trial ended with a 'not guilty' verdict. The Congressional investigations in the 1970s revealed many more facts. Many books were written from this new information.

The ""Mister X"" brought in as a 'deus ex machina' is not in Garrison's book. He is based on L Fletcher Prouty, whose articles or books were available to Oliver Stone. LF Prouty joined the Army in 1941, and retired decades later. His experiences were in ""Black Ops"": executive action for the Government. Prouty was in the Philippines, Vietnam, etc. Prouty pointed out that it was SOP to have Army officers scout any location for a Presidential visit. It was not done in Dallas. The questions of ""Mr X"" remain: who benefited from JFK's assassination, and, who could cover it up.

So watch and enjoy this drama. You should read ""On the Trail of the Assassins"", or other books on the unsolved mystery of the Assassination of JFK. Is the conspiracy still trying to kill JFK's reputation? JFK was neither the first or last Ruler to enjoy female companionship as a perquisite of office, like stars in music or sports. Politicians are not moral role leaders, like ministers, priests, or rabbis.
An assassin who uses a pistol will be caught or killed. They are fanatics who sacrifice themselves for their cause. As assassin who uses a rifle will be able to get away to collect his pay; this implies a conspiracy. You can decide for yourself.",1055808000,2,2798,4.800829875518672

The direction is brilliant, the acting is stellar and the script is so well researched (I know, I own the documented script), so sharp, so thoughtful and so intriguing. Every aspect of the movie comes together perfectly, keeping you hooked throughout the entire film.
The movie takes on the hefty approach of an inner-governmental conspiracy brought to light by the unpopular new Orleans DA Jim garrison. Many people thought he was a flake, a radical, and completely insane for pursuing what seemed to be an unanswerable mystery surrounding the assassination of Presidnet Kennedy. In the film, Stone has used documents, historical facts and leads from Garrison and co.'s investigation. According to the film, Oswald was most likely exactly what he had claimed...a patsy.
I won't, under good conscience, ruin any more of the plot for any potential first-time viewers, but I will say this: this is a landmark film for american cinema.

97413,5,0790729733,"Great DVD, more than six hours of intrigue included in the full package.  Donald Sutherland's character sums up the most essential questions for understanding the events of 11/22/63 and also the events of 9/11/01: why did it happen? who benefitted? and who has the power to cover it up?  Just as the Kennedy assassination was immediately followed by a military adventure into southeast Asia, we now seem unable to stop our runaway war bandwagon leading to Iraq.  And based on what happened in Dallas to JFK, it might not be such a great idea to try.
One factual error Stone misses in both the movie and the editor's cut is the purpose of sending Gov. Conally's bloodied suit to the cleaners, which Lyndon Johnson ordered.  The film implies that this was done to destroy evidence.  In fact, Lyndon knew that the Governor's suit -- with a bullet hole in the back of the jacket, one just under the right front lapel, and then a third bullet hole in the left leg -- was Big John's lucky suit.  Compared to what happened to the guy riding behind him, Nov. 22, 1963 was Conally's lucky day all around.",1045958400,,1095,4.561224489795919

 Now, much has been said about Stone, in the media, but we must understand that this same media has CIA Agents working for it, which makes the media's opinions pure government Propaganda.
The scoundrels who attack this film are trying to do your thinking for you.
 Dont let them. Watch ""JFK"", and learn many of the facts concerning the Conspiracy to kill President Kennedy.
In ""JFK"" you will learn about the obstacles that New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison had to overcome, as he tried to tell this great country the truth about Kennedy's Assassination.
 You will see how the media used lies to try to discredit Garrison, like they did to Oliver Stone when this movie came out.
 You will see why the Magic bullet theory can ONLY be a lie.
 You will see how the majority of witnesses thought that shots came from the Grassy Knoll.
 This movie will hit emotional nerves in you, that you never knew you had.
 You will never forget it, once you watch it.
It will make you think, it will make you cry, it will make you ashamed to be an American, and happy to be an American all at once.
 Ashamed of the government that lied to us, but proud of the enduring spirit of Americans like Oliver Stone, who refuse to let the government lie to us about who nullified our votes in 1963.
 This may be the most important movie in American History.
It is the movie that opened the eyes of Americans.
 This movie has many, many facts in it. Some things are just speculation, others are a counter myth to the Warren Commission myth, but all in all, this movie will lead you to the real killers of our President, and to those who hold our very Freedom in their cold calculating hands.

Oliver Stone practically offers us a complete 2nd screenplay and talks enough facts to fill a class's worth of material. If I was a teacher, I would play the director's commentary to my students. It's THAT informative. Fascinating.
JFK on DVD is truly rare in that this is one of the FEW movies out there that really offers something substantive on DVD...you know...truly exploits what DVD is all about. There still is some useless stuff in the DVD such as ""interactive menus"" (useless), ""multimedia essays"" (haven't seen them), ""deleted/extended scenes"" (kind of interesting, but useless because they are worth watching once and not worth paying extra for).

  The title ""JFK"" unfortunately is a misnomer, as the film is not about JFK at all, but about the assassination.  And this film bombards you with so many facts and scenarios your head will be spinning more than Linda Blair.  The main flaw is that the film simply offers too many scenarios and crams them into a film that is too long (189 minutes/add 20 for director's cut).
The most compelling scene is that of X (Donald Sutherland) as he gives Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) details of ""Black Operations"".
As X says, ""noone said aloud 'let's kill Kennedy', but it was understood and the conspiracy took shape in the traditional form of a black op"".  Unfortunately this doesn't gel with reality.

  But the film is actually focused on Jim Garrison, the New Orleans attorney who investigated such unlikely characters as Clay Shaw and David Ferry.  The final court case he puts together is laughably inept...basically the only evidence he has against Shaw is the Zapruder film.

I saw this film when it first came out, but it was so controversial then that many people sought to debunk it.  Like Orson Welles's ""Citizen Kane"" (Okay - it's good, but not THAT good.) JFK, and its director Oliver Stone was subjected to incredible criticism.  Now that time has borne out Jim Garrison's version of events, JFK is even more accurate than originally thought.
The directors cut, along with the deleted scenes, has Oliver Stone admitting that he was playing a little fast and loose with the facts, but in a more conservative direction most of the time.  In other words, he downplayed some things that he believed to be true but could not adequately document.  The extra disk with an update on the Garrison version, and the interview with the mysterious Mr. X is priceless.

97430,5,0790729733,"first of all, JFK is probably one of the greatest and most contriversial movies EVER made. JFK was so contriversial, that the government themselves were scared about the threat this movie posed. because of all the uproar from the american people, the government formed an assassination committee which released certain files into the assassination of John Kennedy.
the movie centers around Distric Attonrney Jim Garrisson's investigation into the murder of the century. you follow Garrisson's every move from his interrigation into the ""most important witness in history"" in David Ferrie to the conclussion of the trial. Great movie with many factual events and many interpretations of what could have happened. you can't fit all the information of the JFK assassination into a 3 hour movie, so you compress some of the information, like Oliver Stone did.
the DVD features are great. you meet Donald Sutherland's character, X, and you see a 30 minute film on the new documents of the assassination. you also get to see a whole bunch of extra or deleted scenes. you have to watch the extra and delected scenes in order to appreciate what job the film editor and Oliver Stone did to make this masterpiece complete.
great film that moves you in one way or another.",1034640000,3,1261,4.981042654028436
97431,2,0790729733,"Walter Cronkite came up with probably the most accurate assessment of this Oliver Stone fiasco: he called it ""a bill of goods."" More fully, Stone plays recklessly with a pivotal and defining tragedy in American history by putting virtually everyone in the ""grassy knoll,"" from the slain President's successor and even to LBJ's successor, Richard Nixon. Along with them is the nation's entire intelligence community, from the CIA and FBI to most every known anti-Castro Cuban-American. ""JFK"" is nothing more than a dangerously misleading packaging of virtually every assassination theory ever developed. For anyone who hopes for any credible reason for the insanity in Dallas Nov. 22, 1963, they're not going to find it here. Instead, we're left with the dangerous and (at least because of the lack of evidence cited) unfounded impression that literally everyone in government service was part of the probable conspiracy that ended the Kennedy Administration. Granted, this is only entertainment. But its subject is too important to play as dangerously loose as Stone does with known facts. Pass this one up.",1031702400,3,1107,5.295454545454546

For years, Jim was bashed and destroyed by the federal government and media. However after viewing this movie, one can't help but finally give Jim Garrison the credit he deserved for having the courage and guts to bring the jfk assasination to trial. There are alot of people who to this day question Jim, but as years pass, it is proven more and more that he was right in his theory of a conspiracy to kill the president. This movie is based on Jim Garrison's book ""On The TraiL Of The Assasins"" and also on Jim Marrs book ""Crossfire: The Plot to Kill Kennedy"". Once you view this movie, i suggest you read those 2 books and i'm sure you'll have all the facts you need. The special edition DVD includes many special features including the ""new documents"" which further proves Jim's theory. Jim Garrison was a very special man and Oliver Stone knew this and finally let Jim fight back against the people that belived his investigation was a fraud.

97433,5,0790729733,"If you only ever listen to one commentary on a DVD, it should be this one.
First off, I'll just let you know that I'm leaving my opinions out of this review. Just take three hours and sit down and watch this movie. If thats all you take from it, then that is fine. If, for some reason, this movie inspires you to head to your local library and write a few request letters to the National Archives, then you have truly found the meaning of Oliver Stone's film JFK. This is not a rewriting of history, it is an interpretation by a man who put 4 plus years of research into the work and uncovered as many new leads and facts as anyone had in the twenty years prior.
It is amazing how many of the so-called ""made up facts"" and ""rewriting of history"" has been proven to be correct in the subsequent releases by the house sub-committee on assasinations and the freedom of information acts committee reviews following the release of the film in the early and mid 1990s. Thank Stone and this films controversialities for much of the information you now have about the JFK assasination. Put the facts together for yourself, they would expect you to believe everything you see and read. There are many books and resources on this and many websites where you can read or listen to the actual testimonies, I would ask all those who slam this film to do the same. Do a little free-minded investigation of your own. Good luck.",1024444800,,1412,4.434615384615385
97434,5,0790729733,"Director Oliver Stone tackles the biggest conspiracy theory of all time in this all-star cast, big budget production. It is not that easy to defend a theory like this, but Stone packs in a great deal of believable evidence to back his claim. The idea that there was more than one individual involved in the assassination of President Kennedy doesn't seem that far off the mark after viewing Stone's three hour plus masterpiece. Kevin Costner brilliantly plays District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man in history to bring someone to trial for the murder of President Kennedy. The rest of the cast is great, I especially loved Joe Pesci and John Candy - two very different roles than what they were used to. What you may not read on the trivia section for JFK is that Martin Sheen did the voiceover narration for the film, he played President Kennedy in the TV series ""Kennedy"" and in THE DEAD ZONE he plays a politician that faces an assassination attempt. JFK took two Academy Awards for best cinematography and best editing. These two awards were well deserved as Stone is now notorious for editing black & white sequences with color sequences which blend together beautifully. This film will always be a milestone, in my opinion, in risk-taking cinema. Whether you believe it or not, you have to give the man credit for going against the common ideology and making a bold statement that we don't have to believe everything we hear and we don't have to swallow everything whole, that it is good to question things no matter how tragic they are.

97435,5,0790729733,"To say Oliver Stone's epic JFK was a little generous in exposing half truth's about the JFK assasination would be a gross understatement. In fact, some of the most chilling moments in this 'true' story are mere heresay. However, movies were not made to educate, but to entertain. And this movie comes through. Filled with numerous cameos (Walter Mathau, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon) this ensemble piece really manages to focus upon one man's lone struggle to prove that the asssasination of JFK was not only done by someone else than Lee Harvey Oswald, but that the government knew Oswald was innocent. Second maybe to only To Kill A Mockingbird, this film delivers the best courtroom scene ever produced. And even though this movie winds much longer than 3 hours, there is not a dull moment. If you want to know the truth read a book, but if you want Oliver Stone's truth, watch JFK, Stone's best film and Kevin Costner's best too.",1017792000,7,960,4.789156626506024
97436,5,0790729733,"Upon release JFK was heavily criticised for being a speculative film that was liberal with its account on the JFK assassination. I believe it is the greatest film ever made, and that these critics are probably the same people who predicted Fight Club would inspire a generation to start beating each other up. It is not my favourite film but JFK is perfect in every way, and showcases the heights at which this medium can reach.
There are two DVDs available. Warner were hasty when DVD arrived and shipped off loads of films that had zero features (the odd trailer here and there) and JFK was one of them. Thankfully there is now a Special Edition DVD that spans over two discs. The first contains the film and Stone's commentary. The second disc's notable inclusions are the ""multimedia essays"" and a near hours worth of deleted scenes. The second disc is great but even if it were not part of the package I would still be urging you to buy it because the commentary Stone provides is ridiculously good.
If you look at JFK on merely a filmmaking level you will appreciate it all the more. It is probably the most accomplished, daring and epic film ever made. Lord Of The Rings may have been difficult to film (understatement) but no one can tell me it is as complex as JFK in terms of plotting and editing. There are so many scenes, cuts and speaking roles (think Traffic times ten!) that it startles me how under appreciated the film is. The courtroom scene alone should be analysed by film students across the world. Then think of the cast (the best ever assembled?): Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Michael Rooker, Kevin Bacon, John Candy and many more. How Stone managed to handle this many stars proves his strength as a director.
Anyway, the commentary covers everything. The filmmaking, the writing, the politics, justifications of excluding certain events, scenes and characters and he responds to each criticism of his film and makes the people who voiced them look like idiots. And Stone is not like a monosyllabic Tim Burton (whose commentaries can be so boring and painful at times). He speaks with an articulacy that is rare among any Hollywood director. He is an educated man whose intelligence overwhelms the listener. He ends on an ambiguous tone. He questions my generation (I am 18). He asks if I am an institutionalised consumer in a capitalist society who blindly accepts the information fed by the media. That is DEEP! Stone's intention in this film was to elevate the importance of the JFK assassination. To show how a country that was once founded on the greatest of ideals allowed such a horror to occur. It is also a very relevant commentary as the face of Lee Harvey Oswald could easily be replaced by the face of Osama Bin Laden.
I thought the Fincher/Pitt commentaries were good but Stone puts them to shame. This director has proved to me that film still matters, that it is a serious medium which can make serious changes in the world. If you care about film you should own this DVD.",1017792000,9,3100,4.700367647058823
97437,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone, to say the least, is one of the most controversial directors in film history. Many see him as a dangerous loose cannon who rewrites history to fit his own agenda. I see him as a filmmaker who has the guts to speak his mind on controversial subjects -- even when his point of view flies in the face of ""conventional"" wisdom.

Nowhere is this more true than in JFK. Despite the fact that a large majority of Americans believe that President Kennedy was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, the media lambasted Stone for his interpretation of the events of November 22, 1963. Various journalists and columnists called Stone everything from a revisionist historian to a crackpot when the film was released. To be sure, New Oreleans Disctrict Attorney Jim Garrison wasn't the knight on a white horse of Stone's film -- his investigative tactics were very shady. Garrison mysteriously did not investigate possible mob connections to the assassination. And Stone does implicate almost everyone, including Presidents Johnson and Nixon, J. Edgar Hoover and almost the entire Dallas Police Department.

However, Garrison is merely a catalyst for Stone's thesis as the only person who ever indicted a suspect (Clay Shaw) in the murder of John F. Kennedy. And even with its myriad of conspriacy theories, the sad fact remains that Stone's interpretation is much closer to the truth than the Warren Commission Report. We can, for example, see on the Zapruder film that JFK is suddenly and violently slammed backwards and to the left by the shot to his head, indicating a firing position from the front and not from the Texas School Book Depository where Lee Harvey Oswald was. Most Americans don't believe that Oswald, who, at the height of the Cold War, defected to Russia with the intention of passing on U.S. Government secrets, married a Colonel's daughter, then somehow regained his U.S. citizenship and returned to the U.S., was just the ""lone nut"" the Warren Commission claimed he was. And most Americans don't believe that Jack Ruby killed Oswald merely to ""spare Jackie Kennedy the trauma of having to return to Dallas for Oswald's trial."" In spite of this, however, the media jumped all over Stone's film, lambasting him as loose with the facts and irresponsible.

Stone does in JFK what the Constitution gives Americans the right to do -- namely question authority when the answers it gives us do not satisfy and enlighten. I don't think that the media was part of the plot. But the media does act as a unwitting aid to the conspirators when they whitewash the work of an Oliver Stone as the work of a crackpot. Perhaps the media collectively does not have the courage to risk its reputation or maybe they are frustrated and angry that they didn't dig deeper at the time of the assassination. Whatever the reason, they do no service to either the people of the United States or the truth when they issue their blanket dismissals of JFK and other films like it. I agree that Stone should be held accountable for any inaccuracies in his films. However, the press should be held just as accountable when they back the utterly useless Warren Commission version of the Kennedy assassination. Gerald Posner can shout ""CASE CLOSED"" all he wants from the highest mountain top, but the questions and the doubts remain.

Last June I visited Dallas, Dealey Plaza and the Texas School Book Depository. To say it was an eerie experience was an understatement. Most of the museum on the sixth floor (where Oswald allegedly fired from) was dedicated exclusively to the assassination. However a large portion of the museum was dedicated to President Kennedy's life and administration. Almost as heartbreaking as the memories of his assassination and funeral were the reminders of all the hope and potential that was snuffed out on November 22, 1963. JFK brings back the pain and anguish of not only the assassination, but America in the years after John F. Kennedy's assassination. Thank you, Oliver Stone, for showing us what we lost and for inspiring us to demand the truth.",1014768000,69,4079,4.890173410404624
97438,5,0790729733,"As a student of history (majoring in the latter 20th century), this film provides one of the definative overviews of the conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of JFK. The film mostly follows the book by Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins, although there are some times when Stone throws in ideas from other conspiracy theories.
In addition, the film has phenonomal performances by Kevin Costner (an actor whom i normally find mediocre at best) as Jim Garrison, Sissy Spacek as Garrison's long-suffering wife, Joe Pesci as David Ferrie (with Pesci playing one of his trademark annoying characters, but this time it actually serves to advance the plot), and Donald Sutherland, in my favourite role in the movie, as X. In addition to these fine performances are Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, John Lemmon, Walter Matthau and many more: this movie is virtual 'Who's Who' of Hollywood~ and don't forget Jim Garrison himself as Chief Justice Earl Warren!
While this movie does not make everyone's top ten list, the movie portrays exactly what it was meant to: Garrison's exhaustive obsession with the events surrounding Kennedy before, during, and after his murder. Whether or not you agree with his conclusion is beside the point: this is the documentation of Garrison's search for his own personal Holy Grail. (You need to give the man credit on one point at least: how many people can actually slog their way through the Warren Commission Report in its entirety?)
Summary: this film is a very moving story of one man's search for the truth despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles. As long as you keep an open mind through the film, it is informative as well. While i am wisely choosing to keep my personal beliefs to myself, as they have no point in the review of a film, it should be remembered that there are several sides to every story, and a wise person will utilize as much information as is available to come to an educated conclusion as to whether Oswald acted alone, or the CIA had a role, or the mafia, or whether JFK is hiding in a log cabin in the mountains, playing cards with Jimmy Hoffa, Elvis, and Jim Morrison (as one tabloid printed several years ago.) This movie helped America to realize that the case of Kennedy's murder still has questions that still need to be answered (Why is the government still holding onto documents that should be viewable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act? Why did the CIA finally admit in 1977 that Clay Shaw *was* an Agent after all?)
All in all, see the film. It does provide an interesting perspective on one of the most defining moments in the 20th century.",1012953600,8,2659,4.79520697167756
97449,5,0790729733,"Before I saw ""JFK"" I knew what, basically, everyone knows about the timeless president. I knew he was a great leader, and a good president, and that his death was a shock to the world [which illustrated how popular he was]. So, being only 15 when I first saw this film, you can forgive me for being a little ignorant about the growing resistance to JFK the President.
After watching this movie, my world changed. Oliver Stone presents the picture in a way that is so easy to understand, and he gives us all the facts, and makes the conspiracy theory easy-enough to follow. This movie will make you question everything - do the CIA and FBI have a hold over the President of the biggest countries in the world? If the said President stands up for his own beliefs, is he in danger of his very life? ""JFK"" tells us the answer is ""yes"", and shows how other Presidents will be merely puppets when forces like the Secret Service are in existence.
After watching this movie about 100 times, I can honestly say that I am never bored. It still leaves you with an ominous feeling of helplesness, and sorrow - but also makes you feel that you have been ""let in"" to the secret that has plauged the world since the 1960os. The actors are amazing - it is Kevin Costner in his best role [although he was, too, excellent in the 2001 film, ""Thirteen Days""]. He can keep the viewer going for 3 hours of film, without growing tired, which is excellent.

97451,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone's JFK is a brilliant piece of gritty analytical cinematography. It's much, much more than a film though. It would be a mortal sin to dismiss it as such.
This is the story of Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his search for the truth within a system riddled with lies and treachery. His research, following the death of John Kennedy, uncovers a shocking conspiracy manifested deep within the most elite realms of the US Government. The deeper Garrison digs, the more dangerous it becomes and the greater amount of compelling evidence comes into focus; revealing how, in true Shakespearean style, one of the world's greatest leaders was rubbed out by his own.
Even though his marriage was to suffer, his life thrown into the most unimaginable turbulence, Garrison never gave up his quest for justice and truth until his death in 1995. This is a film that any one who rejects the status quo should watch. Garrison's closing speech to the court is tear-jerking, articulate and above all, logical.
This film is a classic regardless of whether it proves to be true or not. It represents something that is very rare in Hollywood today - that is, disputation over the axiom. Sadly, made in 1991, it doesn't seem to have set a trend.
Maybe the true meaning of this film shall be realised when the innumerable amount of classified documents currently held by the likes of the NSA are released for public consumption sometime this century. Maybe...",1011312000,2,1449,4.846774193548387
97452,3,0790729733,"Oliver Stone is a brilliant director and storyteller.  If you understand going in that his story is not fact, but a collection of unrelated conincidences, unsubstantiated anecdotes and pure rumor that is woven together as a fictional account of the Kennedy assassination you will do fine.  If you accept the film as gospel, you are doomed and there is nothing we can do to save you.
Based partially on the memoirs of Jim Garrison (the Oliver Stone of the legal world) and partially on the unsubstantiated claims of others, this film paints a dark and bizarre view of the most important event in our nation's last sixty years. It is as fascinating to watch as it is depressing to contemplate.
In this world, most everyone in the federal government at the time (including, apparently, the President's family) actively participates in a world-wide coverup for a group of cross-dressing anti-communists who murder John Kennedy for revenge.  Those that do not aid the coverup are actively involved in the plan itself.  Their allies may or may not include the Communists themselves, Organized Crime and Texas state and local governments.  They would also have to have the ongoing help of a good number of those that have held power in each of those groups from 1963 to the present as well.
Coming away from the film, you recognize Stone's genius as a storyteller and want more.  You should also recognize that what you saw was a story - the greatest urban legend of all time.
If Stone must have a conspiracy to investigate, here's one:  the CIA gives him the idea for ""Any Given Sunday"" as payback.",1011225600,7,1592,4.788321167883212
97453,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is a remarkable film that is too often overshadowed by the very real events upon which it is based and by the perceived political agenda of its director. But, as Stone himself has stated on numerous occasions, the movie is not meant to stand as a definitive historical document but rather as an alternative look at what might have happened on that fateful day in Dallas given the conflicting and incomplete information that came out of the official final word on President Kennedy's assassination, The Warren Commission Report. Much of ""JFK"" is based on known fact but Stone has taken it one step further and extrapolated out a variety of possible realities based on the many unanswered questions and perplexing coincidences that surround the case.

The central character in the film is Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the district attorney from New Orleans who actually brought the case of the Kennedy assassination to court -- some three years after the fact. Although his attempt to convict Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) of conspiracy in the assassination of the president was doomed to failure, the facts that he uncovered, and continued to pursue through his later writings on the subject, gave a certain legitimacy to the claims by conspiracy theorists that all was not right with the official investigation. Through countless scenes, the government's assertion that Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) was in fact a lone gunman who acted of his own volition and with no outside help is continuously under siege. By the end of the film, every preconceived notion that the viewer may have had regarding the assassination has been called into question.

In addition to the actors mentioned above, ""JFK"" is a virtual who's-who of Hollywood talent. Rounding out the cast are Kevin Bacon, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, and even John Candy. In all instances, the performers bring a certain degree of mystery to their roles that really reinforces the overall disconcerting feel of the film.
Enough about the film already, what about the DVD? Well, as many of you know, Warner first released ""JFK"" as a movie-only edition back in 1997. While this DVD featured Oliver Stone's preferred director's cut of the movie with some 17 additional minutes of footage reinserted, the video was non-anamorphic and the audio was a merely serviceable DD 2.0 mix. In addition, the lack of any extras was a shame and the disc itself was a dreaded ""flipper"". With this new release, Warner has addressed all of these issues and ""JFK"" is at long last available in a fine special edition DVD.

""JFK"" is presented in anamorphic widescreen, preserving the 2.35:1 aspect ratio of the original theatrical release. Sharpness is usually quite solid although the extensive use of filters lends a somewhat soft appearance to the image in a number of scenes. Black levels and contrast are good with only the darkest of scenes losing fine shadow detail. Colors are accurate and exhibit no signs of bleeding but the palette is, for the most part, somewhat muted. I could spot no instances of compression artifacts and the edge enhancement that plagued the original release is mercifully gone. The video is a marked improvement over the old release and, while it isn't a perfect transfer, I could find no glaring issues with the work Warner has done preparing this release.

Just as the video has been upgraded for the new special edition, so too has the audio. Replacing the fairly good Dolby Digital 2.0 mix on the previous release is a brand-new 5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack available in both English and French. The increase in dynamic range afforded by this new mix really makes John Williams's moving score come alive and adds some overall depth to the soundtrack as a whole. Surround use is frequent and well-integrated and dialogue is always clear and firmly anchored to the center. While this new 5.1 mix certainly won't give the best soundtracks a run for their money, it is a fair improvement over the previous release and is very well done.
Now we come to that facet of DVD that truly defines a special edition -- the extras. Seeing as how the film itself is quite long, Warner has taken the step of making ""JFK"" into a two-disc release in order to accommodate the plentiful bonus features.

Disc One features the movie itself and provides a very engaging commentary track by Oliver Stone. I've listened to a number of his commentaries and they are always informative, entertaining, and full of great personal and professional recollections. ""JFK"" is no exception as the director delves into every facet of this remarkable film. His tone is always conversational which makes the three plus hours spent listening to him more enjoyable than one might expect. Rounding out the extras on Disc One are cast and crew bios and filmographies as well as a list of the awards that ""JFK"" has garnered.

Disc Two is where the real strength of this special edition resides. First up is a 15 minute interview entitled ""Meet Mr. X: The Personality and Thoughts of Fletcher Prouty"" in which the real-life Mr. X discusses his particular take on the assassination. Played by Donald Sutherland in the movie, Mr. X was to Jim Garrison as Deep Throat was to Bob Woodward -- a shadowy source who provides the hints needed to further the investigation. Next up is ""Assassination Update: The New Documents,"" a 30 minute multimedia essay hosted by noted conspiracy theorist James DiEugenio. Combining text, photographs, and video clips, Mr. DiEugenio delivers a very riveting, if not a bit overwhelming and scattershot, look at the facts of the case that have come to light in recent years.

Are we done yet? Not even close. Also included on Disc Two is 50 minutes of additional footage that can be viewed individually or as a complete set and with or without Oliver Stone's accompanying commentary. Combine this with the 17 minutes previously added back into the film and you have well over an hour of footage that wasn't in the original theatrical release. As is the case with some of the scenes that were added to the director's cut, much of this bonus material is redundant. Nevertheless, there are some real gems here and it's great that this abundance of cutting room casualties are included on the DVD.
Rounding out the extras on Disc Two is the DVD-ROM content that features links to a number of websites, a series of theatrical trailers for this and other Oliver Stone films, print reviews of ""JFK,"" and a link for a future online chat with Oliver Stone. Whew!

Now we turn to an aspect of this DVD that I rarely mention in a review -- the packaging. ""JFK"" is presented in Warner's preferred snapper case, which should come as no surprise. But, in order to accommodate the two discs, a pocket has been added to the cover flap and Disc Two resides there in a flimsy little envelope. It really is a screwy method that may be a bit rough on that second disc over the long haul so it's best that the buyer be forewarned. But, on the plus side, Warner has taken the negative comments about this packaging to heart and have promised to come up with a better alternative for any future two disc sets.

""JFK"" is a thought-provoking film that remains almost as big a conundrum as the subject upon which it is based. Many viewers and critics see it as nothing more than another political rant by that crazy Ollie Stone. Others have had their eyes opened wide upon seeing it and no longer view the world in quite the same rosy light as they once did. Skillfully filmed, well-acted, and at its very core quite unsettling, ""JFK"" stands as one of Oliver Stone's finest films.

And what better way to treat a great film than with a brand new two disc special edition DVD? Featuring vastly improved video and audio, the new release presents ""JFK"" in fine fashion. The wealth of bonus features that examine the film itself, and the real-life events it revolves around, add some much needed depth to the understanding of this pivotal moment in American history. Throw in the fact that Warner is offering this two disc special edition for much less than some studios sell their bare-bones DVDs for and you have a sure-fire winner. The film and the DVD both come very highly recommended.",1009324800,100,8292,4.816713483146067
97454,5,0790729733,"Stone's masterpiece is a marvelous work of cinematic choreography and script-writing.  It is equally a profound contribution to media genres which strive to stimulate thought rather than repress it.
The film's importance does not simply end with the movie theaters and reviews.  And it is no less significant that even cable-TV channels seem bent on avoiding the film.  It had a deep impact on American government, provoking a landmark piece of legislation in the US Congress, passing as the 1992 JFK Records Collection Act.  The Act itself was unprecedented, mandating a unilateral review of classified government documents across the entire cabinet-agency landscape by independent academics appointed by the President.
Immediately after the preview of the film before both houses of Congress -- and before its release to the public -- critics scrambled to destroy the film, arguing that it was filled with misleading fiction about Dealey Plaza and that it shamefully revised history, placing a false understanding of historical fact in the minds of America's young.  Let's examine those criticisms carefully.
Stone used dramatic artifice to protect living witnesses of the events surrounding Dealey Plaza, and to chronologically relocate factual correspondence and exchanges between the two star consultants to his film-making -- Jim Garrison (d. 1991) and Col. L. Fletcher Prouty (d. June 5, 2001).  He replaced Perry Russo --  Garrison's keystone witness in the 1968 Clay Shaw trial -- with a fictional homosexual prostitute in Angola Prison, portrayed by Kevin Bacon in the film.  Russo got a bit part in the barroom scene at the beginning of the film.  The correspondence between Garrison and Prouty occurred between the late 1970s and the early 1990s, so Stone moved it into the context of the Clay Shaw trial with the fictional meeting of Garrison and ""Mr. X"" near the Lincoln Memorial on the Capital Mall.
Except with some minor liberties taken with the film's reporting about the death of Eladio del Valle, it dramatically presents the Shaw trial in a reasonably accurate evidentiary context.  The film draws much material from Garrison's own book -- ""On the Trail of Assassins"" (1987).
Viewers who wish to expand their understanding of the facts and suspicions presented in the film will do well to pause the second VHS tape during the black-and-white flashback recalled by Mr. X of the phone conversation presented from the perspective of ""General Y's"" office, so that they can read the US government nameplate behind the vase on the General's bookcase.  With the passage of the Records Act, several witnesses and investigators came forward to publish their memoirs, absolved of their non-disclosure agreements with the government.  Viewers who want to examine the publications precipitated by the film can begin with Mr. X and read Prouty's memoir -- ""JFK:  The CIA, Vietnam and the Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy"" (2nd ed. 1996).
Some viewers and many dabblers in the forthcoming literature of the assassination are glib in their recommendation of Gerald Posner's ""Case Closed"" -- a work that is suspect just in its timeliness, and which can be torn apart with new evidence and facts.  I argue that Stone, despite his many detractors and criticisms of the ""Natural Born Killers"" film satire, is a film-maker committed to the Truth.  That ""JFK"" merely presented pointers on the assassination-research compass to a general audience was sufficient to Stone's apparent purpose.  Its instrumental role in catalyzing the Records Act is irrefutable history.  To say he took some liberties with his material is equivalent to saying that Shakespeare adapted the history of Julius Caesar and took advantage of the Elizabethan stage as a money-grubbing opportunist.
The difficulty with the history of Dealey Plaza is the political layer of reality which surrounds it.  When the trail-signs enter the exchange of political dialogue about the Dealey Plaza history, certain partisan ""believers"" either tend to run away or throw stones -- no pun intended.  Stone avoids noting those consistent trail-markers that bear a particular partisan stamp -- preferring instead to examine the overall landscape of special interests surrounding the government agencies central to the film's plot.  He looks beneath the political icing to reveal the actual cake itself.  As the historians of American film-making add to the public's appreciation of the genre in the Future, Stone will be remembered every bit as well as Orson Welles for ""Citizen Kane"".  In fact, both directors bore deep scars on their careers that were consequential to the release of their respective masterpieces.",1007510400,11,4680,5.295945945945946
97455,5,0790729733,"This is the best film you could ever watch about the JFK assassination.  The movie compells you to research the events leading up to the conspiracy that ended the life of the 35th President of the United States.
Some people have complained that elements within the ""JFK"" version of the conspiracy are historically inaccurate and fabricated.  This was done on purpose by Oliver Stone so people will look at the real-world evidence for themselves and discover the truth.  What is the truth?  The truth is that a conspiracy occured on November 22nd, 1963 because there is no way in the entire existence of universe that one man could engineer all the events that led up to Kennedy's assassination.
Those who continue to believe that Oswald did it alone will always be in denial and are forever brainwashed by the Warren Commission.  Anybody who watches the Zapruder film and doesn't see the glaring evidence of a gunman on the grassy knoll when Kennedys head falls back and to the left during the head-shot is either ignorant, stupid or both.  People who believe that Arlen Specters ""magic bullet"" can pause, stop, spin and do U-turns in mid-air to make the seven wounds in Kennedy and Connally, will believe the moon is made out of green cheese and walk off a cliff when told to do so.
Two versions of history have been a war with each other since that fateful day in 1963; written history and memorized history.

UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS SO MUCH OPPOSITION AGAINST HIM, IT MADE IT HARD TO TRY A CASE.

97457,5,0790729733,"By in large most of the criticism of JFK is based on Oliver Stones' use of poetic lisence to rewrite the events of October 22, 1963. Personally, I find for better or worse the most plausible explainations surrounding the JFK assassination to be found in Gerald Posner's brilliant book, ""Case Closed"". Whether you want to believe it or not, 90% or more of the findings in the Warren Commission's report are irrefutable. Yes, there are many unanswered questions, and JFK the movie sheds little or almost no light on these. But, that does not take away from the stunning artistic value of this great motion picture.
Stone treats the entire story, start to finish almost as a Hitchcock thriller. Sure we know where the story is heading and of course there is no surprise ending. So how does he keep us intrigued for two solid hours? How do we remain transfixed on the characters; Osewald, Ruby, Clay Shaw, Jim Garrison and others? Simplely put this project was flawlessly cast, expertly edited, well written and masterfully directed.
Oliver Stone has made some great movies, The Doors, Wall Street, Platoon and Natural Born Killers to name a few. But, JFK will remain his masterpiece. Forget the historical incorrectness. Don't get hung up on the conflicting information from the Warren Commission and other sources. It's easy to dismiss this flim as inaccurate or half-truth. It is however, much harder to dispute the artisic value found here. This is simply one hell of a movie.",1002844800,13,1476,4.884462151394422
97468,5,0790729733,"Most of the controversy over this movie has to do with whether it is historically accurate. But Oliver Stone's JFK does not make a grand statement as to what the facts are; it merely pokes about a hundred holes in the Warren Commission's account of what happened. At the end of this riveting film, you are left with the sense that Jim Garrison may not have been barking up the right tree, but the lone nut theory (along with the single bullet and all the rest) seems equally implausible.
Regardless of the historical facts, this is not a documentary, it's a fascinating film inspired by real events, a scary imagining of what might have been. The acting is first-rate, the editing is the best Stone has ever done and the soundtrack is haunting.
Slamming this film over accuracy alone would be like slamming Shakespeare for taking liberties with the lives of certain British rulers and ignoring the work itself.
BTW, I felt that the director's cut did not do much to advance the film. I would have preferred these as deleted scenes, because they slow down the otherwise very taut direction...",1001289600,3,1091,4.717277486910994

So he made it into a movie with the help of real life New Orleans District Atttorney, Jim Garrison.  The result, an entertaining, but thought provocative film.  We'll never know the answers about what happened, but Stone gives us some food for thought.",1000425600,,361,4.885245901639344
97470,5,0790729733,"First off, I will state that this is a fabulous piece of film-making.  The direction is strong, the period recreation is amazing, the editing is mind-blowing, and the cast is phenomenal...particularly Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald.  His performance is right on key and he looks incredibly similar to Oswald...just as he looked like Sid Vicious in ""Sid and Nancy"" and Ludwig Van Beethoven in ""Immortal Beloved.""  Oldman is a chameleon who can seemingly look like anyone.  He becomes the characters that he plays, and his turn as Oswald is no exception.  Now...on to the substance of the film.  This film is not 100% accurate, nor does it purport to be anything other than an educated guess as to what MAY have happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  It is, however, leaps and bounds ahead of the Warren Commission Report, which isn't even believable in the slightest.  I may not be convinced that this film's vision of the truth (based on books by Jim Garrison and Jim Marrs) is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but I've done my own research and I find it to be far closer to a believable theory than that proposed by the Warren Commission, whose report was...let's face facts, America...pure fiction.  Anyone who believes that lone nut Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK needs to take his or her blinders off and start living in the real world.  Still, one cannot say that Oswald (one of the most fascinating characters in American history) was not capable of amazing feats...like simultaneously being active in the Soviet Union and the United States...though that's easily explained when one takes the time to find a copy of the memo sent from J. Edgar Hoover himself to the Department of State on June 3, 1960, which reads in part ""Since there is the possibility that an imposter is using Oswald's birth certificate, any current information the Department of State may have concerning the subject will be appreciated.""  There you have it...as far back as 1960, there were at least two Lee Harvey Oswalds running around.  Not to mention that the LHO who was treated for tonsillitis twice during his stint with the Marines was obviously not the LHO who had his tonsils removed at the age of six.  Nor was the LHO who had a 3-inch mastoidectomy scar behind his ear and a gunshot scar on his elbow the same LHO who was autopsied after being gunned down by Jack Ruby.  There were AT LEAST two Oswalds active at the time of JFK's assassination...and many eyewitnesses have stated that they saw the police escorting Lee Harvey Oswald out of the rear exit of the Texas Theatre at the very same time that the Lee Harvey Oswald who was charged with JFK's murder was being led out the front.  It is, therefore, possible that while Oswald's double (who is said to have resembled the real Oswald a great deal) may have been involved in the assassination and killed officer J.D. Tippitt, the real Oswald was taken into custody, while his double was led out the back of the very same theatre and set free.  At any rate, there is a wealth of information out there, waiting to be discovered.  My advice is to watch this brilliant film, but not to take it at face value.  While you're at it, read up on the assassination.  Start with ""Crossfire"" by Jim Marrs, and once you've made it through that lengthy volume, move onto other independent research.  Much can even be found on the internet, including Armstrong's detailed outlines of the existence and movements of the two Oswalds...up to and including the day of the assassination.  Gather all of the information and decide for yourself.  But don't swallow the answers that are being force-fed to you...because almost invariably, they're lies.",998092800,9,3688,4.738654147104851

Oliver Stone worked more of his magical directing in this film with Kevin Costner. I especially liked the paranormal quality of the cinematography, the way it switched from full color to black and white flashbacks to grainy ""home video"" style was superior in style to many other mvoies I've seen. Unless your thoughts are set in stone before you watch, this movie will make you believe by the end. Considered by many (and me) one of the finest movies to date.

Costner's performance is superb, providing an image of a morally driven, anguished Garrison that makes all of the (highly embellished and short-sighted) conspiracy ""proofs"" immensely believable.
Those of us who can remember the end of ""Camelot"" will find a few thought-provoking surprises. As one who remembers everyone's weeping for the real JFK, it surprisingly was not until I saw the tavern scene in this film that I realised that Kennedy would hardly have been mourned by those of certain Southern mindsets.
Several scenes are especially powerful, among them the report which makes it appear that Oswald was a CIA agent and Garrison's meeting with the military man who described how deliberately security precautions in Dallas had been violated. In the latter case, the explanation of how a nation's power is in war, and how Kennedy was killed to avoid putting an end to ""police action"" in Viet Nam, is delivered so powerfully that, at least for a moment, one thinks one finally has the key!
The presentation is narrow, of course, and should not be taken for the last word on history. Yet powerful cinematography and acting, and well developed story lines, make this a winner.",996624000,4,1323,4.963963963963964

97476,5,0790729733,"A lot of viewers do not like Oliver Stone's films because they have had the misfortune of seeing and hearing Oliver Stone on television in real life.  It is wise to keep the two totally separate.  Oliver Stone the filmmaker is a great artist with a masterful hand at cutting edge story telling and ""JFK"" shows that talent at its peak.  Oliver Stone the real life person can be grating, obnoxious and offensive to just about everyone and would do himself a big favor by not making personal appearances.  This is his personal, artistic version of JFK's assassination.  He makes a compelling case for the proposition that JFK was murdered as part of a conspiracy by powerful forces in our own government rather than Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone.  JFK was obviously a hero of Stone's and Stone even believes that JFK would have prevented the escalation of the Vietnam War.  In fact, he believes that the Vietnam War was made possible only by getting rid of JFK.

I buy more into Stone's  conspiracy theory than I do this lofty, ultra hero view of JFK.  However, this is his vision and he certainly can put on quite a case, which he does through Kevin Costner, acting as District Attorney Jim Garrison of New Orleans prosecuting Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) for conspiring to murder JFK.  Costner shows his full leading man appeal plus the intensity, earnestness and idealism that had become the trademark for a Costner leading role.  Stone is known for getting fabulous male performances and that is true of every male performance in ""JFK.""  For example, Gary Oldman is fabulous as Oswald as is Jones as Shaw and Joe Pesci as David Ferry.

Sissy Spacek is reduced to a wife as wallpaper role, which is also typical of Stone, but you don't go to an Oliver Stone film to see great roles for women.  This is a long movie that seemingly is over too fast since Stone really knows how to keep things moving.  If you see this film back to back with ""Thirteen Days,"" also with Costner and about JFK, you will see an incredible difference in both film making ability and acting deliveries.  I've seen this film 3 times and been glued to the screen each time.

97489,5,0790729733,"Even now, ten years after it was first unleashed, Oliver Stone's 1991 epic JFK continues to provoke controversy and debate, like many great films have been known to do.  Perhaps he can be faulted to a point by raising so many conspiracy theories and for making a hero out of New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison, who was the only one to prosecute a JFK-related case.  What Stone can't be faulted for, however, is taking on this whole thing in the first place, and with good reason.
The assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963 remains one of the darkest events in our nation's history.  This is made even more so because the official version of the murder propogated by the Warren Commission and apologists like Gerald Psoner stopped being believable to a lot of Americans a long time ago, well before Stone's film was ever conceived.  Stone offers what he calls a ""counter-myth"" to the Warren report, one that involves a cabal of individuals from the Mafia, the CIA, organized crime, and the military/industrial complex coordinating to do in a man who might very well have ended the Cold War during his term in office and might very well have stopped the disaster that befell our nation in Vietnam.
His theories on the ""Who"" are open to question, but the ""Why"" is far more believable and far more troubling.  As played by Kevin Costner (perhaps his greatest performance), Garrison dwells into a New Orleans connection to the Dallas tragedy and indicts local businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) on conspiracy charges.  Lack of tangible evidence caused a jury to acquit Shaw of the charges, but this didn't mean that Garrison was wrong for bringing the case to trial.  And if U.S. history since November 22, 1963 has shown us anything, it is that he certainly wasn't wrong for suggesting that JFK's murder was not only a turning point, but an elaborate coup d'etat.
Stone crams in a great deal of material that has to be absorbed during its 205-minute running time, but he is aided by a cast that is to die for: Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Bacon, Walter Matthau, Laurie Metcalfe, Donald Sutherland, Michael Rooker, Gary Oldman (as ""alleged"" assassin Lee Harvey Oswald), and many others.  With the Oscar-winning help of editors Joe Hutsching and Pietro Scala and cinematographer Ralph Richardson, Stone also masters the ""montage"" complex, editing together in great rapidity footage shot in 16-millimeter, 35-millimeter, color, and black and white.  Nobody had used the montage method with this kind of power since Sam Peckinpah did it in his 1969 classic THE WILD BUNCH.  John Williams contributes another one of his masterful music scores.
Even if it seems to be too ambitious and zealous for its own good at times, JFK is essential viewing for people who want to come to grips with everything that has happened to America since that dark day in Dallas.  It is gripping from end to end, a true American epic.",994636800,,2971,4.828740157480315

I was in Dallas on the eve of that fateful day. I remember an eerie, blood-red moon hanging over the flower-strewn grassy knoll at midnight.

I heard many bizarre stories regarding the immediate aftermath of the events of that day including a witness, a local weatherman on WFAA, who claimed he saw Ruby and Oswald together at Dealy Plaza 24 hours before the death of JFK.

97493,5,0790729733,"Ever since I was born I've heard the claim that America is the land of the free, with a strong belief in freedom of speech. Why, then, does a film that presents an opinion get dragged through the mud?
Before seeing the film I'd read many books regarding the assassination. Going in, I had my own opinion that Oswald could not have killed Kennedy. There was definitely the possibility that he'd been involved, but he couldn't have done the shooting.
This film presents the idea that the CIA had been invloved - something I agree with - but primarily it follows the case of Clay Shaw. Personally, I don't believe he had been involved. And if he was, it was unknowingly. Like Oswald, I think he was used. Like many people it would seem.
The films most positive trait is its willingness to leave room for you to come to your own conclusions. It presents many well known, and some not so well known, facts. As an assistant to Jim Garrison [our main character] says, when referring to Oswald supposedly doing the shooting from the Book Depository, ""that's the whole essence of the case to me. The guy couldn't do the shooting"". Coupled with all the reports of witnesses to a man behind the fence on the knoll, and the clear evidence that more than three shots were fired, we know that many of the reports are a fabrication.
The most important question it asks is not who killed Kennedy, but why he was killed. The idea of it having to do with Vietnam is a little far fetched, but worth considering. Garrison's meeting with Mr. X is especially revealing, when you discover how much basic Secret Service protocall was ignored that day.
The special features are excellent. Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful, and the 50 minutes of cut scenes worth watching twice [with and without commentary]. Also impressive was the enourmous amount of chapter selections, coming in at over 80. The multimedia essays are a little dull, but it's to be expected. A lot of effort has gone in to this DVD and it shows.

JFK won a well deserved OSCAR for editing and it shows. There is a unique and quite riveting mix of actual footage with re-created footage of assassination in Dallas.  The collector's edition includes several plusses. The theatrical trailer is just as riveting as film itself. The B- disk includes several deleted scenes. I felt that Stone should have left in the scene involving the Colorado businessman offering Garrison a bribe if he would stop the investigation. There is a sequence involving man-X that was the original ending(Stone felt, initially, that the Man-X and Costner exchange needed an intermission in order for audiences to absorb all of that intense information connecting the military-Pentagon involvment) of the film, and there was a great deal of ending credits that were cut explaining how Garrison was indicted for bribery following the Shaw Trial, de Mohrenschildt's suicide, divorce of Jim and Liz Garrison in 1978, etc. There is a director commentary option as well that is interesting.  The collector's edition sound is good quality, but use of rear channels does seem limited. I have the VHS and there is more of a surround effect on it! Picture quality is excellent, and highlights the use of the light coloring at the beginning and color increases as we are taken to 3 years after assassination(notice how the color changes during the beginning of scene with Senator Long(Matthau) and Garrison), and Stone explains why this was done on the commentary disk.

However, to think Oswald was the lone gunman in the Kennedy assassination is being very nave. Not even the best marksman with far superior weapons could get off the number of shots Oswald supposedly did in that amount of time using a bolt action rifle, let alone score two head shots ( one in the throat and the other in the head). But I do not want to concentrate on that point but the movie. The acting was superb from all the actors which included: John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, and of  course Kevin Costner.

This great new DVD edition that contains extra material not in the original VHS or previous DVD edition shows even more that what Stone is trying to do here is educate the viewer. ""JFK"" is an eye-opener, it warns against trusting the official version of events when the evidence points to something differently. It paints a chilling picture of how governments and power really work in the world. There is so much information in this film, and yet it never seems confusing. We know exactly what Stone is saying here. Sure there is dramatic license, but look at how intelligent and plausible the speculation he uses in certain scenes is. And do your own research and you'll see that ""JFK"" is most likely correct in it's theories and insights into the assassination of John F. Kennedy. It is clear, and has been known by anyone with an open mind and who has read his/her stuff that Kennedy was killed as the result of a conspiracy. This is how the world works. Artistically the film is a visual triumph, it is hypnotic in the photography, editing, music, writing and acting. Stone also adds exuberance. Like Stone's ""Platoon,"" ""Born On The Fourth Of July"" and ""Heaven And Earth,"" and even ""The Doors,"" ""JFK"" is not so much a documentation or visionary dramatic interpretation of an era, but also a look at us ourselves. At LIFE. This is an important film that should be shown in high schools, because students should see this. ""JFK"" forces you to think for yourself, to look at the facts, to use your mind. Stone is an artist who directs with a passion, he's driven by his subjects and presents stunning films that will endure and are already standing the test of time.",983145600,,1809,4.673981191222571

There are many stars in this movie that give great performances, among others Kevin Costner, of course, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau as a U.S. Senator, Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald, Kevin Bacon as a male prostitute, Joe Pesci as a principal part of the conspiracy, Donald Sutherland as an ex-CIA man who helps Garrison, Tommy Lee Jones as a conspirator with a few secrets, and Seinfeld fans will recognize Wayne Knight (Newman).

97514,5,0790729733,"JFK is Oliver Stone's controversial film about the conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of President John Kennedy.  The film is based on the investigation that was started by New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison.  The film is a visual marvel, with flashbacks, quick cuts, some scenes in color, some in black and white, all perfectly weaved together for a tight cohesive film.  The view of the film is that President Kennedy was killed by Cuban sympathizers and Lee Harvey Oswald was a part of the conspiracy, but was set up as the fall guy.  Whether you believe this theory to be true or if you think Mr. Stone is full of hot air, one can't deny the power of the film.  Kevin Costner stars as Jim Garrison and leads an all star cast that includes Sissy Spacek (as his wife), Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldham who is perfectly creepy as Oswald.  JFK followed Platoon, Born On The Fourth Of July & The Doors and completed Mr. Stone's look at the 60's.

""JFK"" is a motion picture presentation of how many America FEEL about November 22, 1963....they FEEL that something much darker,ominous  and profound happened that day in Dallas than just a man in a window shooting at a man in a car and this FEELING is what Oliver Stone's movie is all about.
Even those of us who tend to discount Stone's conspriacy theory and believe Oswald acted alone have to acknowlegde the film's power and sheer technical cinematic brilliance.

97516,4,0790729733,"This new DVD Special Edition of Oliver Stone's JFK adds several new features to the classic political thriller.
First is commentary by Stone himself, which runs the gamut from fascinating behind the scenes glimpses to self-serving and intentionally misleading propaganda. Stone, to his credit, does correct a few inaccuracies including the ""three tramps"" contention which he now admits is bogus. He is occasionally defensive and refers frequently to critics of the film sometimes in a derogatory fashion.
A second addition to the disc is the deleted and extended scenes. Three of these stand out-a meeting between Garrison and ""Mr. Miller"" (a personification of the military-industrial complex or secret government, which ever you prefer), a scene where the ghost of Oswald speaks, and an alternate ending again featuring ""Mr. X"". Most of the other scenes are mere extensions or scenes rightfully deleted.
Rounding out the special features are two ""multimedia essays"". The first is a segment on documents released by the ARRB presented by Jim DiEugenio. The other is an interview with Fletcher Prouty, the inspiration for the film's ""Mr. X"". The essays will probably not enlighten those familiar with either gentleman, but newcomers may find them useful.

I remember seeing the poster for JFK in my local theatre and thinking ""He's dead!  Let him lie.""  I was about twenty years old and the national obsession with the JFK assassination was completely tedious to me.
At that time, the last great movie I had seen was Silence of the Lambs.  A great film, and one I was sure would win the Oscar for Best Picture that year.
Then I saw JFK.....(wow).... *spoken with great awe*
I changed my vote. JFK was awesome.  The funny thing is, I still don't care who killed JFK, but I really loved the film and how the conspiracy seems to just fit together.
This may be one of the reasons why some people dislike or refuse to see this movie.  They actually care about the subject matter.  Sort of like examining The Bible as literature without looking at it as religion.
But if you can put your opinions and feelings on the Kennedy assassination aside and simply watch the movie, JFK is a tour de force in filmaking.  I highly recommend it.",979689600,3,1012,4.403225806451613
97532,4,0790729733,"In response to garbages complaints, you have got to look a little deeper into the facts of this case.  The distance that Oswald had to shoot from was considered 'Expert range'.  Oswald was not a prize marksman.  And he was using a mediocre weapon.  They had experts shoot the same distance with the same type of gun and they could barely make the shot on 90% of the attempts.  Oliver Stone's depiction is riveting, no doubt, but I'm sure he takes plenty of liberties.  He is liberal as hell and loves to create controversy.  The movie is still full of real facts, including the reaction of Kennedy's body when he was shot and the muzzle flash from the knoll.  THERE WAS DEFINITELY ANOTHER PERSON SHOOTING AT KENNEDY'S CAR.  There are other facts that raise a lot of questions as well.  The route of the motorcade, Oswalds motive, Ruby's death.  If you want to create an opinion, get information from more than one source.  This debate has been going on for a long time and we know there have been cover ups and undisclosed information.  Posner's book is most likely a jaded and one sided opinion.

97535,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone did his homework and produced a great film that we may now enjoy some of the truth about the murder of JFK.
The best way to watch this movie is to not only pay very close attention to the film, but better yet, watch a two tape series called ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" before you watch the film JFK. It is to my knowledge the best comprehensive study of the circumstances in and around Dealy Plaza on Nov. 22, as well as giving many researchers a chance to speak about their findings over a 30+ year period of investigation. One of the things that makes the series so interesting is the research done into all the possible shooters that were retained for the job.
The only failing of the series is that there is no mention of the shot that came from the storm sewer to the right of the motorcade (which probably blew his head off ), or the dozens of people who died of mysterious heart attacks and accidents in the weeks following the assassination. As far as I know though, nobody has made mention of this to date except a few of the more eccentric researchers into the assassination.
The best research into the reasons that Kennedy was murdered for me, came from Prevailing Winds Research Magazine based in Santa Barbara Ca.. It was explained to me in an understandable way that Kennedy was trying to stop the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, and was setting up parallel intelligence agencies that were in direct conflict with the established CIA that was born out of WWII and the mass recruitment of NAZI's. These were just a few of the many things that Kennedy did to bury himself. Kennedy's brother later said it best when someone asked him why he did not run for president and he replied ""the bullets, the bullets, the bullets"".",977097600,2,1768,4.4937888198757765

97538,4,0790729733,"JFK is brilliant filmmaking.  Innovative use of period stock, timeline distortion, flashbacks, and great acting all combine to immerse the viewer in a world that feels decidedly real.  Stone succeeded wildly in technically innovating his way to a new kind of cinema verite. The problem is, of course, JFK's just a movie, but the people it depicted (mostly) existed.  That immediately opens up Stone's directorial tour-de-force to criticism on grounds of accuracy.  There, it languishes in ambiguity and doubt.
Though Garrison only barely lived to see the film released, his colleagues at the time have since given interviews in which they described the characterizations of Ferry, Shaw and other principles as unfamiliar.  As another reviewer has pointed out, no mention is really made of Shaw's meritorious military service in World War II, nor is Garrison's characterization of Shaw as a ""CIA operative"" really challenged (he was never on the CIA payroll).  Likewise, the film fails to directly explore what happened to Garrison in later life, and how his theories about the assassination kept getting broader and less fact-based.  There's no discussion of the allegations of bought witnesses, flimsy evidence, or corruption which swirled around Garrison at later stages of his investigation, and which ultimately helped to lose him a re-election bid.  Garrison is merely portrayed as a quixotic hero tilting at government windmills.
And indeed maybe he was.  Maybe the loss of David Ferrie (his star witness) was so devastating to his case that he tried to put it back together again, using flimsier evidence.  Maybe he really had a case and it just evaporated.  Or maybe, like some members of the Lousiana press were reporting at the time, he had nothing.
JFK does little to settle the debate surrounding Jim Garrison.  If anything- and maybe this was Stone's point all along--it's just deepened it.  That escalating debate is mirrored in the emotions evoked by the film itself.
At its worst, JFK is seen to be dangerous, fact-starved propoganda.  Some have found it easy to compare Stone to the acclaimed German director, Leni Riefenstahl, whose stunning art glorified Hitler's regime at the expense of literal truth.
At its best, Stone's vision is a dramatization of a few branches of the assassination story unknown to most Americans.  Prior to this film, many were unaware that there had been any sort of court case at all connected with the assassination, and that it might have led to a conviction, had Garrison been able to provide better witnesses.  It can be claimed that the many inaccuracies in the film are no more egregious than what generally happens in many historical dramas.
Whatever faults there are in the facts on display, though, there is actual history in Oliver Stone's film.  It's just not the history of the assassination, or even an entirely accurate record of Garrison's investigation.  Rather, JFK's strength is in dramatizing some of the main conspiracy theories.  And if viewed as more allegory than fact--if Costner's Garrison is seen as a theatrical lens through which to view the various strands of conspiracy theory that have long floated around the assassination--then it works less problematically than if you try to see it as a definitive history of anything that happened in Lousiana or Texas in the 1960s.
Fifty years from now, JFK will likely be seen as an accurate history of the way the assassination made people feel.  The assassination was the start of anger and rebellion against the government in America.  And, whatever its other faults, JFK shows why.  Even if many of the events in JFK aren't literally true, and real people take an unjustified beating in Stone's harsh light, Stone isn't exactly making it up.  He's putting on the screen the questions that so many Americans had then, and certainly continue to ask.  He doesn't arrive at his conclusions through meticulous academic research; Stone assumes, perhaps to his detriment, that Garrison and Marrs have already done his homework for him.  No, JFK Is history by reflection.  Stone has put a giant mirror in front of the American people and asked whether we like what we see.
[DVD Notes: Don't even bother with any other version but the new Director's cut.  Neither DVD version has any significant additional featres, but at least the Director's cut has 17 more minutes of footage.  It's very frustrating that the DVDs are so devoid of extra features, because there's so much that could have been included.

97563,5,0790729733,"That day America lost charismatic leadership elected by the people in  favor of secret government. After WWII, we realized we could not ever be  caught unprepared for war in a nuclear age, so we continued on in a state  of ""cold"" war. JFK wanted to change this in the middle of the  ""Cold War""; bad timing for sure. All of those that quibble (look  the word up) about Stone's details or pronounce the ""LHO did it""  have never fired a weapon in U.S. military service, least of all a cruddy  Mannlicher-Carcano. Get one and just try manipulating the bolt fast enough  for 3 shots. Then try aiming and proper breathing/trigger control. Next,  watch the head of JFK react backwards from a frontal shot in Stone's  showing of the Zapruder film, proving a frontal shot from a second gunman.  Next ponder on the FACT that the next U.S. Government assasination  investigation concluded it WAS a conspiracy requiring 2 or more gunmen. The  official U.S. Government position is that there WAS A CONSPIRACY. The  Warren Commission misconclusion has been superseded. Now what are YOU going  to do about it?

The point is the people of America have become cowards,  the secret government knows that it has to do all our dirty work because we  certainly will not do it. This is why they knew they could remove the  elected President by coup d'etat and get away with it, as they then  proceeded to kill RFK, MLK, Malcolm-X and George Wallace, don't forget they  shot Reagen, too---anyone who offered a shimmer of hope of ""being his  own man"" while in public office/position of visibility that could  awaken the lazy Gen-Me/X/Y generations.

What died that day in Dallas was  the belief that a charismatic leader could inspire the populace of America  to get involved in our government. Since that time its been all ""down  hill"".  And who is to blame?

We are.

When we become more  intelligent as Stone's films can make us realize the nature of things, then  we can take a more active role in government without the secret caretakers  of this Republic getting alarmed and feel like they have to assassinate us.  It took a tremendous amount of courage for Oliver Stone to make this film,  and I salute everyone in the cast, too. The point of this film is to be a  charismatic THINKING leader in your own right and not let the ""bad  people scare you"" as Garrison tells his children.

Stone shows why  the men who killed JFK were angry at him, and they have good reasons for  their wrong doing. Still makes it wrong, but ""good people"" can do  bad things. Look at Nazi Germany--we are not immune from mob or  group-think. You don't offer to disarm in the face of world communism. See  Stone's Nixon and this will be clear, too. However, the conspirators that  killed our charismatic leaders are wrong because America needs people of  charisma holding things together at every level, they alone can't do it  all. If they wanted JFK out of office, see to it that he was voted, not  SHOT out of office. What we have here today is a slow death of America at  many levels by a pervading lack of trust in the people in our government,  partially because we cannot seem to elect good people into office or if we  did, not have them shot out.

The movie clearly poses the question of  whether we are going to continue as a nation based on just a war footing  run by others or are we going to stop being selfish consumerists content to  let others handle the pressing matters of the nation? Or will we like  Garrison/JFK seek and find the truth, dare to be different and spend our  lives doing things far more interesting like space colonization and make  that our nation's reason for existance? We need a competent  military-industrial complex or we will not survive as a nation, but we will  not survive long if we don't get an enlightened citizenry that is able to  understand the complexities of the world (not quibble in order to sit on  one's rear) and assume the responsibility of our nation without disarming  in the face of the external enemy. The internal enemies are tougher. I  think we know who they are. We have met the enemy and he is us.",966729600,4,4125,4.565753424657534

He took as a premise, the case of Jim  Garrison, the only lawyer to ever take the Kennedy assassination to court.  This is only the excuse for Stone to bombard us with fascinating and  dangerous information that may or may not be true, but we all know that  something fishy was going on. Besides being a directorial triumph it is  also a technical landmark with outstanding editing, probably among the best  ever. A terrific all-star cast bring all these characters to life.

I was  astonished at the sheer brilliance of the filmmaking, JFK has to rank as  the best edited film of all time.  Technically, the film is brillant and  breathtaking.  A richly textured and dazzling cinematic experience.  However, this is not style over substance.  Stone presents us with a huge  amount of information:  names, dates, different theories, flashbacks,  flashbacks within flashbacks, ect... It's incredible how much information,  how many ideas Stone packs into his film, but his direction is so assured  that we are NEVER for one moment confused or lost in the material.  He and  his co workers have masterfully assembled all this material into a hypnotic  tapestry (his use of the Zapruder footage in the film is brilliant).  The  assassination of JFK is one of the most tragic events in modern American  history.  I've never subscribed to the Warren Commission explanation, and  Stone does a masterful job illustrating his ideas and theories.  It's  important to remember that this is NOT a documentary, its one filmmakers  exploration of a pivotal moment in U.S. history.  Even if you don't  subscribe to Stone's theory, you gotta admit, it's a breathtaking film.  This film will scare you, inspire you, and force you to think and act.

97584,5,0790729733,"Who did Oliver Stone make JFK for? Historians? He must have known that they would drag him through the mud for throwing in every popular conspiracy theory regarding the JFK assassination. He must have known they would scream about fabricated characters meant to represent an amalgam of  resources in the name of saving time. He must have known that he would be  railed for portraying Jim Garrison ( played by Kevin Costner ) as a white  knight of truth.
The fact is Oliver Stone didn't make JFK for historians.  He made JFK for non-historians of American history. At the time I saw JFK I  had read history, but only European history, and mostly the Middle Ages.  After JFK I read two books about the assassination and did a little  research on the internet. More importantly it lead me to reading books on  the Vietnam war, the cold war, the depression, the first world war and the  second world war. If JFK can get the jaded MTV crowd to get up off their  seat and read about history then JFK has done it's job. The argument has  been made that JFK teaches the wrong history. It is felt that our youth  will be harmed by believing that the movie is truth. In all honesty a  person who gets their history from films or the daily headlines is lost  anyway. The genius of Oliver Stones direction is to use Hollywood  pyrotechnics and a bitter time in our history to create desire in the  viewer - a desire to seek the truth.
...and what a film.
The great  director Martin Scorsese once said that he wasn't very original when it  came to the way he used his camera and the way he edited. He went on to say  that he had studied the masters and merely updated the means by which they  directed. Perhaps this is a humble oversimplification, but Scorsese, a  premier film historian should know. While some of the devices seen in JFK's  camera work and editing might have been used before, it has never been used  to such degree. Using stock footage, hand cranked cameras, black and  white/color jump cuts and overlapping audio techniques JFK creates a  dizzying cyclone effect (He would out-do himself in the same way, in the  great NIXON ).  I wasn't born when JFK was shot and killed, but I can  imagine that those days and the subsequent 10 or more years seemed like  wise - a dizzying cyclone effect.
I hope that JFK has found others  wanting to get up and look at history as a means of understanding our  future. It seems to me that the memory JFK deserves no less.",960076800,2,2463,4.442953020134228

97587,5,0790729733,"""The organising principle of any society Mr. Garrison is for war, the authority of the state over its people resides in its war power"" Mr. X to Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) in J.F.K. .
  Oliver Stone pretty much  lays out his case in the first 30 seconds of the film with a speech by  President Dwight D. Eisenhower warning against the accumalation of power my  the military industrial complex. His theory is that the army and the  overall war machine need a war inorder to justify their existance and  maintain their power. He names names, like Bell Helicopter and General  Dynamics, companies that had Billions to lose in the event of world  piece.
  The imagery, theories, drama and ideas contained in 30 seconds  of sceen time of this film exceed what other films contain in their entire  running time. As the film starts  we are told by voice-over that there is a  secret war being waged by the CIA and angry Cuban exhiles against Castro,  Kennedy inherits this war which leads to the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion  which ofcourse was a complete disaster. Kennedy wants to make piece with  the Russians, wants to pull out of Vietnam and thus is labeled a communist  and an ""Irish bleeding heart"". What follows is a vast conspiracy  between all branches of the government, the mob and the Cuban exhiles to  assasinate him. One of Jim Garrison's assitants logically asks him  ""How on earth can you keep a conspiracy like that running between all  these people when you know for a fact that you can't keep a secret between  12 people in this room?"" That is a logical question, and Stone  concedes that his film is partly a theory, but what he does is much more  important that prove WHO killed JFK, because ""WHO"" as the  mysterious Mr. X (Donald Sutherland) puts it is just scenery for the public,  what Stone does show is ""WHY"" he was killed.
  The root of  all the conspiracies in JFK is the office of an ex-FBI man, now working as  a PI in New Orleans. His name is Guy Banister(Ed Asner), and he doesn't  seem to do any PI work at all, through his office every character in the  conspiracy will pass, from Lee Harvey Oswald(Gary Oldman), Clay Shaw(Tommy  Lee Jones) and Dave Ferry (Joe Pesci). They are all rabid anti-communists,  scheming how to get rid of the beard(Castro), organising militias in the  anti Castro movement. All this in the same street in New Orleans as the  offices of the FBI, CIA, Secret Service and ONI. Bizarrely Oswald who as  the Warren Comission would have people believe was a ""communist""  chose to spend most of his time there. It is obvious that he was being set  up from the biginning, perhaps even setting himself up as the  ""sacrificial lamb"".
  All this may make this film look like an  incomprehensible flood of political jargon, but what make Stone's  achievement a near miracle is that all this is wrapped is a package that is  riveting, fixating, gripping and brilliant from start to finish. I could  use all the positive adjectives in the world and not come close to  describing the impact of this film. Stone mixes documentary footage with  black and white and colour photography to create a hypnotic whole that  feels dangerous. He manages to give the audience a feeling that they're  seeing classified information they are not supposed to see. There are  numerous cameos by big stars in small roles like John Candy, Walter Mathou,  Jack Lemmon and Kevin Bacon just to name a few, but these are not  distractions, they give a film a measure of importance. Throw in John  Williams superb score and Robert Richardson's beautiful photography and  turning away from the screen is simply not an option.
  There isn't space  to praise all the performances in the film, but three particularly stand  out. Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw, Joe Pesci as the manic Dave Ferry and  surpirisingly Kevin Costner in the lead role as Jim Garrison. This is  definitly Costner's best performance to date, his final speech in the court  room is riveting.
  Kennedy said ""We all inhabit this small planet,  we all breath the same air, well all cherish our children's future and we  are all mortal"". He was trying to breakdown the barriers between  people, and they killed him for it. Who ""they"" are will probably  remain an eternal mystery, but at least we know why they did it. JFK is not  only Oliver Stone's finest and most important film, but one of the best  films of the 1990s.",957657600,6,4402,4.639322916666667
97588,5,0790729733,"There is much to be said about this film.  For one thing, it is, in this reviewer's opinion, the best film of the 1990's.  Nearly every frame is loaded with huge amounts of information.  And regardless of what you have heard, with the exception of a few minor changes, it IS accurate  information.  As  director Oliver Stone had said in reponse to the critics  of JFK, a filmmaker must be allowed a certain amount of creative license.  After all, were the best biographical films before and since acclaimed for  their factual truth actually perfect models of accuracy?  Not likely.  So  why the urge to single this one out?  I believe it was because of the  controversial nature of the subject and all of the negativity the Warren  Report has received.  It was, in short, an attempt to discredit all  involved (much like the Warren Commission attempted to do with many of it's  witnesses) including the instigator of the only trial in the assasination  of the 35th president of the United States.  For all the mistakes made  during said trial, Jim Garrison alone stood up to the people and  organizations that tried to keep the truth about that fateful day in 1963  from surfacing.  He and he alone is the most responsible for bringing the  other theories out in the open.  Yes, there had been many books written  that criticized the slipshod way the Warren Commission  ""investigated"", but it was the trial of Clay Shaw in the late  60's that brought many of the speculative theories to the main stream  public for the first time.  Despite Garrison's sometimes questionable  methods, no one can deny the man his motive: to bring forth the truth in  what might very well be the crime of the century.
Stone is relentless in  HIS quest for the truth, and it's this marriage of director and story that  make the film so remarkable.  In scene after scene  he reinstates  Garrison's vulnerability with the public.
But this did not stop Garrison. Nor over twenty years later in  1991 did it even put a dent in the opinions of Oliver Stone.  The director  uses his connection and knowledge of the 60's that was so apparent in many  of his other films-PLATOON, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY and THE DOORS,  particularly-to attempt to tell the absolutely mesmerizing story of the  D.A. of New Orleans' search for the facts.  He holds the viewer with a  series of superbly edited but very quick sequences that really give a DVD  player a workout.  Thank goodness for slow motion.
The script wisely and  fittingly tells this story through the eyes of Garrison himself.  You  really feel the persecution he feels as he becomes more and more obsessed  with his search.  When his wife (well played by Sissy Spacek) finally  confronts Garrison with his obsession, your heart is in your throat.  It's  obvious that even with the people he had working for him, the D.A. is  basically a man alone.  In the final monologue, based on Garrison's final  address to the jury, you certainly hope he succeeds. Fortunately, Stone balances the emotions of a family torn  apart, with some stunning scenes based upon the beliefs and findings of  authors such as Garrison himself, Mark Lane, Jim Marrs and David Lifton.  For the first time we have a big budget, well exposed film that combines  all the theories together.
The director's cut only further proves Garrison and Stone's  opinions.  The scene in the washroom could make even the most secure person  paranoid.  And the light banter of the talk show host (played by John  Larroquette) while interviewing the District Attorney is more evidence of  how the public and the press treated the trial.
The cast is perfect.  Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon and  Donald Sutherland are all familiar faces here effectively placed in roles  that range from mere guest appearances to full fledged important supporting  roles.  The lesser known actors and actresses also excel, especially Jay O  Sanders, Laurie Metcalf and Michael Rooker as Garrison's assistants.  Gary  Oldman as the doomed Lee Harvey Oswald once again proves his chameleon  abilities as an actor and disappears completely in the role.  Hard to  believe that this is the same actor who was just as convincing as the Count  in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA and as Sid Vicious in SID AND NANCY, among  others.
But it is Kevin Costner's performance as Jim Garrison that always  pulls the film together.  He is very convincing.  It's true that he doesn't  look a thing like the real Jim Garrison.  Fortunately, Costner wisely opted  to use subtle characteristics of Garrison in creating his interpretation of  the man.  The aforementioned final remarks to the jury are not only  believable for what is being said but also for Costner's convincing and  heartfelt delivery.
Technically, the film couldn't be better.  The  recreation of the assasination itself, is absolutely perfect, right down to  the little girl that waved as she ran along the side of the President's  limousine just before the shots were fired.  The cinematography works well  with the Oscar winning editing, to hold the audience in the palm of it's  hand.  The atmosphere of New Orleans is beautifully felt.  John Williams  music score is another example of how the composer captures the very mood  of every film he scores.  The beautiful trumpet fanfare he composed for JFK  easily matches  anything from JAWS, STAR WARS, SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE,  E.T.-THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, SCHINDLER'S  LIST or the Indiana Jones movies.
After many viewings of this film,  I can honestly say that if I would choose to sit and watch it again today,  I would still catch something I hadn't caught before.  What better reason  for owning a copy of JFK (The Director's Cut)?  It must be viewed in it's  widescreen edition.  Watching in a flat or ""full-screen"" format  doesn't do justice to the abundance of information it revels.  And the  dedication to the youth and their search for truth assures that it should  be handed down from generation to generation so that perhaps one day we  will know the whole truth.",957312000,5,6102,4.8427734375
97589,5,0790729733,"After years of extensive research and a college course examining the subject, I am almost convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and that most of the conclusions made by Stone are wrong, especially his vindication  of Jim Garrison's flawed and corrupt investigation.
That being said, I  truly do think this movie is something special. Firstly, it is extremely  well directed and produced, the music is great and most of the acting is  top-notch. More importantly, this movie affected the American mindset like  almost no other. Almost immediately after its release, Congress passed the  JFK Act and began looking into the classified files. When Stone wrote his  screenplay, many files and studies which provided valuable information were  still sealed and the movie's conclusions were affected by that.
However,  I recommend this movie to all because it truly does challenge people to  question everything and to never be lulled into accepting the official  party or government line. That Oswald most likely shot JFK does not mean  that questions should not be asked. All the evidence must be evaluated as  well as the true reasons for covering it up.
Though I believe that Stone  has grossly misrepresented certain facts, it is not the job of the movies  to educate Americans about history. What this movie does is spur an  enthusiasm in its audience to learn more about a particular event and how  it affected us all.

Various notables have  interested themselves in this story over the years. Bertrand Russell wrote  a book about it after the publication of the Warren Report in 1967. Neither  he nor anyone since has had their questions taken seriously, least of all  by the American establishment.
Oliver Stone's film recapitulates all the  main evidence pointing to a conspiracy and does so in some detail. In the  end, we find ourselves asking just what are the limits of our belief (or  disbelief) in this matter.

The supporting cast was excellent,  with Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, John Candy, Joe Pesci, and the list  goes on. It might have had discrepancies in terms of its factual  accuracies, but it certainly is one of the most underrated and the most  riveting films of all time.",953510400,2,831,4.755244755244755

97605,2,0790729733,"I saw this movie in the theaters for its original release and have seen it a few times over the years since then.  Being something of a paranoid leftist myself, I might be inclined, out of sheer desire to believe the  worst of our government and ""the military-industrial complex,""  that this movie is A Good Thing  because it is such a watchable film, with  great characters, mostly great acting (Costner, of whom I'm usually a fan,  lagging behind his costars here), beautiful score, incredible directing and  a very compelling story.
But it's my opinion that this movie is in fact a  Bad Thing, because it is such a transparent distortion of history.  I think  it's irresponsible for a filmmaker who is doing a movie about a specific  historical event to allow his own passions and prejudices to totally  distort that history.  I believe our government has done some brutal,  brutal things.  Some behind closed doors and some right out in the open.  But in this case, it's really hard to argue government involvement, if you  know the facts.  I urge you to try and find them for yourselves, don't  depend on this movie to teach them to you, because this movie is NOT an  accurate portrayal of history, it's Oliver Stone's somewhat obvious and  recurring pathology of the two fathers conflict that i've notice crop up in  at least three of his movies....Barnes and Elias in Platoon, Michael  Douglas and Martin Sheens' characters in Wall Street and now Kennedy and  LBJ in JFK.  I think Stone dangerously simplifies history in this movie  with his idolization of JFK and his demonization of LBJ and his portrayal  of a vast sentient conspiracy within the federal government.  Again, not to  deny that such conspiracies exist and do evil, for I feel that they do.  But not in this case.
Go read ""Case Closed"" by Gerald Posner  (an independent author with no ties to the Government) and tell me I'm  wrong.
So the point of this review is that I feel that all of these other  reviewers who, in their praise for JFK, blithely gloss over the fact that  it's not historically accurate either don't understand just how incredibly  inaccurate the movie really is or seem to be missing the point that it's  dangerous and irresponsible to portay history as anything other than as  accurate as can possibly be done.  Oliver Stone clearly didn't do that  here.  The Jim Garrison case was a disgraceful fiasco that ruined the  reputations and lives of innocent men and has since been historically  discredited.  Maybe I'm making too much of this point, but I'm only doing  so because I haven't seen anyone else in all these reviews really mention  it at all.",952300800,7,2646,4.7312775330396475
97606,5,0790729733,Oliver Stone does a fantastic job here.the cast is incredible.with each passing year a new theory comes out about the death Of John F.Kennedy. Kevin Costner is Money through out.it's a real Epic that keeps your eyes glued to  it.,951523200,,229,4.725
97607,4,0790729733,"The movie JFK is in effect a who-done-it without telling you who-done-it. Oliver Stone gives us the story of New Orleans DA Jim Garrison in his quest to convict businessman Clay Shaw of conspriacy to assassinate President  John F. Kennedy in Dallas. However, Garrison's case against Shaw was never  strong. Truth be told, I myself am not a believer that Mr. Shaw had  anything to do with President Kennedy's death on November 22, 1963. With  that said, there are other factors in this motion picture which do offer  more than a few redeemable gems. Lee Oswald's very dubious movements in  Russia, New Orleans, and Mexico for one. The hostility of the CIA toward  the Kennedy White House, and the Agency's involement with the Mafia to  assassinate Cuba's Castro. The highly implausible saga of the Single Bullet  Theory. And the strange behavior of the Dr. Humes for burning the original  autopsy draft. Factors such as this, to name a few, have put a great strain  on the Warren Report's conclusion that Oswald did it- and did it alone.  Criticisms towards the Report have been around for years prior to the movie  JFK. Yet it was this movie that brought these critical factors to the  national stage and a new generation. History NEED NOT say JFK be the  definative word for the  killing of John Kennedy.  But the Warren Report  CAN'T make that claim either. The Government went into the investigation of  President Kennedy's death with a preconceived notion that Oswald was to be  blamed, and the presentation of evidence was to show that end-and that end  alone. The Comission was bullied by the Johnson White House to finish the  investigation before the 64 election. The ""autopsy"" the Comission  used to prove it's case was a shambles. The CIA's deception to the  Comission on assassination plots with the Mafia on Fidel Castro only adds  to the Warren Report's investigative impotence. True, Oliver Stone's movie  is a mixture of fact and fiction, that is clear. However, it does  illustrate key facts to the case which the Warren Comission failed-or  refused-to cover. That by itself makes this movie worthy of the four stars  I give it. But proceed with caution, dear reader: Be aware that this film,  like so many people's take on the death of John Kennedy, is a blend of  history and opinion. Watch the movie, but also watch your step...",950745600,4,2347,4.807017543859649
97608,5,0790729733,"This has got to be one of my favorite films of all time...I've watched at least a dozen times and pick up on a fact that I didn't see the last time. I am not certain that I agree with all of the facts that Stone is  presenting here, but you can't argue that he didn't do a superb job with  this film. Even if you don't buy the conspiracy theories he presents, the  acting is fabulous, the use of imagery from the period is right on the  money, and the three hours that this film runs is up before you know it.
You can't walk away from this film without at least considering the  information that Stone is presenting. If you really do your research on  this case, however, (and what I mean is read books on both viewpoints and  form your own opinions) you will notice this: any reasonably thinking  person will come to the conclusion that what REALLY happened on November 22  in Dallas and what we have been told throughout history is not the same. Is  Stone's version the ""truth""?  Decide for yourself.
Either way,  don't miss this film. At worst, it will make you THINK, and that is never a  bad thing.",950745600,2,1103,4.270531400966184
97609,5,0790729733,"I had forgotten that I have already reviewed JFK.  However, at the time I was a hard core conspiracy buff.  I probably watched this movie at least 15 times (just ask my wonderfully patient wife) for the sheer joy of the  conspiracy angle.  Well, folks, I am now convinced that LHO acted alone.  That's not relevant here, but if you want to e-mail me, I'll tell you why.  I still believe the movie is of very high caliber with a great cast.  I am  a fan of Mr. Stone and JFK does not disappoint.  I recommend it to anyone  who is interested in period work, but please don't take it at face value.  It is distorted and not very factual.  Do your own research.",946944000,,657,4.209677419354839
97610,4,0790729733,"I don't understand why people gave this movie such a hard time when it first came out.  Some people saw it as an awful piece of Stonian propaganda; I saw it as a film about a man's theories on the JFK  assassination and his quest for the truth--not necessarily, THE truth, but  Truth in general. (To you historians--lighten up! However, I will agree  with you about the ""enhanced"" Zabruder film --a complete and  total abominable fabrication.) Whether you disagree with me or not is  besides the point, however--politics aside, JFK is still a brilliantly  made, compelling and breathtaking film about a particular point in American  history (the mid-1960's) that's rarely been captured on film--of when  people started questioning those very institutions that up until then had  seemed rock solid. If you missed that, then I really feel sorry for you,  'cuz you missed a really great film.",946339200,,889,4.979591836734694
97641,4,0790729733,"A highly charged, in-your-face look at the aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination. Costner is nothing short of superb as Jim Garrison, the ruthless district attorney.

97642,3,0790729733,"I don't have an opinion on the events of November 22 1963, perhaps its because I don't live in America or had not yet been born. In spite of that I have always found this story intriguing. While it does make you think  there are some scenes in the film which make you think that Garrison is  incredibly naive. Nevertheless, the final half hour is gripping as his  theory of events unfolds.
The picture quality of the DVD is excellent and  the sound is good. On the negative side this DVD not only lacks any  features it is also a flipper. I don't mind too much as after the first 100  minutes the break was welcome. For those who hate flippers or want features  - avoid this one.",945388800,7,679,4.2578125
97643,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is an extremely well directed, edited and photographed film. Its editing and cinematography won well-deserved Oscars. It is amazing how Stone manages to include so much information and actually  creating momentum out of them. Despite the fact that it throws all sorts of  rumours and theories about the Kennedy-assasination at us (and this over  three hours long), the film is never confusing or boring. Another asset is  John Williams' very good score. The only weaknesses of ""JFK"" are  the rather uninspired treatment of Garrison's family life and Garrison's  overly sentimental oration at the end of the movie. But such knitpicking  pales in the face of ambition and achievement on offer.
""JFK""  was attacked for just creating new rumours instead of enlightening the  case, but films must first of all be captivating, not historically  accurate. They are pieces of art which show the vision of an artist. If you  want hard facts, read history books, the appropriate medium for that. As a  piece of innovative cinema, ""JFK"" is superior.",945129600,,1059,5.128654970760234
97644,5,0790729733,"Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is undeniably an extremely important film. This is a movie that is not just a study of the mysteries surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy, this is a study of power and the workings  of power. ""JFK"" goes into the dark corners of our government and  it's shadowy dealings. Anyone fascinated by the mechanics of politics and  power should see this film. Stone presents a thrilling piece of film that  is incredibly convincing and disturbing. He doesn't subject to all of Jim  Garrison's conspiracy theories. Instead, he uses Garrison as a vehicle to  search for the truth. He uses Garrison as the base to display the harsh  reality of how Kennedy was killed and why. In fact, Stone doesn't use this  to display HIS own thoughts, but to express many theories. This is also a  masterpiece in the technical area with the stunning effectiveness  ""JFK"" has in the cross-editing, inserting documentary footage  with film footage. The screenplay is brilliant and it's incredible how much  information, characters and powerful drama it contains. The cinematography  is rich and artistic. The acting is powerful like the story.  ""JFK"" should be shown in schools all across America, this is an  extremely important film every American should watch.",943315200,11,1268,5.057971014492754
97645,5,0790729733,"Forget whether this film is factually accurate--it's not.  But that's not the point.  As sheer cinema, it's a tour-de-force, one of the few times Stone's over-the-top antics make the film rather than derail it.  Though  Costner is only serviceable in the lead as Garrison, where this film  flourishes are in the bits: Tommy Lee Jones as an effeminate conspirator,  John Candy at his best as an FBI insider and man of great appitites, Kevin  Bacon gritty and real as a convict contacted by Garrison.  It's easily  Stone's best film--his two Viet Nam films are powerful, but this one has  the scope and sweep of an epic, and for once he lives up to his ambitions.  As a true detester of Oliver Stone's later work, I can honestly reccomend  this as not just palatable but powerful.",940464000,4,778,4.681481481481481

Anyone who watches this film and assumes that everything in it is exactly the way it was, has been led  down the wrong path.  How could anyone know EXACTLY what was said and done  by the conspirators and key players before and after the assassination?  Oliver Stone has done an excellent job in his INTERPRETATION of the events  surrounding the murder.  Those who criticize it are either wearing blinders  or are afraid of something.  Maybe the truth?

97647,5,0790729733,"There are those that criticize JFK, claiming that Oliver Stone disreguarded facts and rewrote history. True or not, this completely misses the point. Stone himself said that his intention in making the film was to  get his audience to question authority and think for themselves. The film  is presented as one POSSIBLE explanation (a combination of two separate  theories) for the unusual events leading to Kennedy's assasination, and it  actually raises more questions than it answers.  The cast is phenomenal.  The award-winning cinematography and editing are groundbreaking to say the  least. Despite your opinion of JFK's politics, the film is one of the very,  very few that I would dare say is perfect. It is the reason I am a  filmmaker, and is worth every second you spend watching it.
