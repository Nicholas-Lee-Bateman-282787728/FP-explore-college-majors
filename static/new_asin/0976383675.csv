174125,5,0976383675,"Dharma Mittra made this easy to follow and beautifully done, I highly recommend this for beginning yogi's. I don't know why I have to write 3 more required words...how silly amazon.",1379635200,,181,4.870967741935484
174126,5,0976383675,"Disclaimer: I took a few classes with Dharma Mittra several years ago, and I was impressed by his knowledge, his ability to teach, the fact that he's in better shape than most people half his age, and above all by his authenticity. This guy is the real deal. Although he is a great hatha yogi, he always underscores, like Iyengar, that asana practice is but one limb of a greater whole. Nevertheless, it's pretty to look at it and it made him famous and this DVD offers excellent instruction. It is his Level 1 DVD but I think if you have no experience with hatha yoga, it will be difficult to follow the moving poses like the sun salutations. I view this more as an aid to practice for someone with some classes under his or her belt who wants to develop a home practice away from the studio. There are different lengths or practices depending on your schedule along with a basic pranayama practice, guided relaxation, and a great lesson in concentration using trataka, gazing (in this case at a candle flame). I have maybe ten or fifteen yoga DVDs and this and the Level 2 are among my favorites. Also, unlike most of the DVDs I've seen, Dharma Mittra emphasizes the inner focus during the poses. The guy's a national treasure in Yogaland and this is a really wonderful DVD.",1367712000,3,1276,4.504310344827586
174127,4,0976383675,"I actually don't think any yoga video except Linda Arkin is good for the absolute beginner. If you have NEVER done yoga, please, find a live teacher.  Learn some basics so you don't hurt yourself by accident.  Then supplement your practice with a video.

I initially bought the advanced Dharma Mittra dvd.  I have been doing yoga daily for about two years and fancier myself not a beginner.  $29 seemed like a lot for video, yet I was encouraged by how much material was covered.  After receiving the level 2 video I thought maybe I'm not THAT advanced lol.  I did watch the section with tips and instruction and that was enough for me to want to buy the level 1. This man is a lovely teacher.  It is encouraging to think there are yogis out there older AND stronger than me!

This is my new favorite workout.  I like that he holds poses for three to five breaths.  The sequencing makes my body feel good, strong, stretched out, lithe and flexible when I am done. I am close to 50 years old.  I also liked that there were many choices, it's not just one workout. You can chose from two different sequences and make them longer or shorter.  IF you are used to bells and whistles, this video is pretty sparse. It's one guy doing the sequence while he voice over explains the moves.  This will not bother you if you are on the floor DOING the sequence, as you will not even be looking at the screen.  The background music is ambient drumming.

Be aware of: early on in the beginner sequence there is a shoulder stand.  Not much prep, you just roll right into it. If you have not achieved full confidence in your shoulder stand PLEASE learn how at a studio before you try this at home.  Second, if you practice shoulder stand ONLY with blankets and props, this dvd won't work for you because the shoulder stand is in the middle of a sequence. You roll in and out of it three times.  You would get annoyed if you had to turn off and on the player while you got your props out of the way.",1328313600,6,1982,4.293800539083558
174128,5,0976383675,"This video is a perfect way to start your Yoga practice - the postures and the physical practice are great, and the spiritual discourses are absolutely amazing.",1207872000,2,160,4.962962962962963
174129,3,0976383675,"Dharma Mittra has an engaging manner, and is a serious (and, of course, highly esteemed) yogi. In the practices I've done so far, though, there's too much repetition for me . . . and I'm not, by any stretch, a practitioner (or teacher) who needs variety. I felt, too, that more focus on alignment, and on coming into and out of postures, would have made the repetition more useful. He provides a physically challenging yoga class--at least, from the intermediate level up--and it's clear that he brings sadhana to his practice. As is often true with DVD instruction, though, the sadhana doesn't translate as well as it could. My guess would be that taking one of his classes, in his presence, would be wonderful.",1200700800,6,712,4.75
174130,5,0976383675,"Expertly sequenced to further develop one's practice, this DVD will definitely prepare one for more advanced poses. As an owner of many many yoga DVDs, I find my self returning over and over to this one. Contains everthing one needs to develop a solid meaningful practice Although, I don't completely agree with his spritual discourse he provides excellent asana and pranayama workshops. DVD Includes 3 beginning asana practices(53 min, 58 min, 64 min, which are basically the same with extended time on sun salutions)and 3 intermediate asana practices (46 min, 64, 82 min). I was initially afraid of pranayama after reading BKS Iyengar's Light on Yoga, he writes"" In Pranayama the yogi uses his lungs as pneumatic tools. If they are not used properly, they destroy the tool and the person using it."" This DVD gives good easy to follow initial pranayama instruction (26 min) and the practice includes rounds of Kapalabhati and Nadi shadona pranayama for a total of 8 min.",1199577600,29,971,5.0
174131,5,0976383675,"I have seen Dharma Mittra excelent asana performing in other videos or shows.  First I felt a Little disappointed because I was looking for hints on advances postures. Then I recalled it is a Level 1 video. Dharma Mittra really teaches a level 1 routine. It is very, very useful for people starting on yoga, specialy if they are over 40 years.  He shows the real adjustments needed for stiff columns and stiff legs. All yoga teachers play with their ego showing how flexibles they are. I know Dharma Mittra is quite flexible and an awesome yogi, but this video is focused on a real level 1 routine. Younger teachers should learn from this no ego teacher.",1194998400,19,654,4.581196581196581
174132,1,0976383675,"I bought it because the review said it is also for experienced student. Though I have just started regular yoga practice for six months, I found it is very slow paced, postures are for beginning level even though in the menu it is intermediate level.  It is said having a 4 hour practice, but many of the options are identical, only longer or varied a little. Also, I did not find the teacher is very helpful in the cue, he just explain the pose like that : bring you left foot forward to a square launch,.. but never remind you what part to take attention and did not mention breath at all..

I think I have wasted my money for this.",1166486400,4,634,4.231404958677686
174133,5,0976383675,"Sri Dharma Mittra has finally blessed us with an epic pair of DVDs for our home sadhana.  These DVDs are of the highest quality, and every facet of Sri Dharma's eight-limbed expertise shines through with radiant luminosity.  Because Dharma covers all aspects of the yoga practice, not just asana, these DVDs are really in a class by themselves.  Dharma's advice and instruction for us on the path of yoga are precise, inspirational, and light-hearted.

The special-feature montage of Dharma's life with music by none other than his good friend Krishna Das is elegant and moving.

I practice with these DVDs often, and am always inspired and challenged by some new nuance in the practice by this living yoga master.  I recommend them consistently to my students, and many of them report a similar experience.",1161043200,15,807,4.985074626865671

Since it's so well rounded those who consider themselves intermediate or advanced will also find much here. I started doing yoga in the 80s, have taken courses from many different instructors, and have many yoga dvds and books, and this would easily make my top 3.

The pace of this video is not fluid. it is very slow and repetitive. I had hoped for more variety, challenge, and greater experience.",1490054400,,281,4.529411764705882

7794693,5,0976383675,"Wonderful to get instruction from a genuine Yogi. Yoga by most Westerners is focused solely on ""exercise"" but there is far more to it than that, even in just the asanas. Hot, young babes in bikinis are NOT Yogis! This man presents TRUE Yoga, he lives it, breathes it. He has the spiritual foundation and practices it. If you want Westernized, aerobic Yoga that has you leaping about from one pose to the other without a chance to breathe properly or get the pose right, then this is not for you.",1476835200,,495,4.450549450549451

7794695,5,0976383675,"For yogis and beginners, this DVD has a nice sequence of basics. I've put this into my DVD player about 30 times a year for the last 5 years.
 Personally, my first yoga lessons were back in the early 1970's, and I still prefer the basic yoga asanas and don't care much for fancy difficult asanas.
 I also like other aspects of yoga, and Dharma Mittra talks about those other aspects in this DVD, such as Karma, Diet, and Pranayama (yogic breathing styles).",1440201600,,456,4.481927710843373
