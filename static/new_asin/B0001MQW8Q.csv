8014832,5,B0001MQW8Q,This introduction to playing my keyboard is very easy to follow and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I can understand every word from the instructor and my keys are right to the point with the video.,1402185600,,204,4.394736842105263
8014833,2,B0001MQW8Q,"This may be nice for someone else but I'm looking for the right venue.
 I ordered Pianoforall software cd instead.

The book cover was marred and the dvd froze a few times.",1396310400,,172,4.34375
8014834,5,B0001MQW8Q,This helps my eschooled daughter to learn the keyboard at home. She enjoys the lessons and loves learning to play music guided by this DVD,1355356800,,138,4.56
8014835,4,B0001MQW8Q,"I have no prior piano/keyboard experience. I got this and was enjoying every minute. I studied for about two or so months, then I had to stop a year ago, because I was too busy.

But, I'm starting again, and I'll be sticking with this book and DVD. Get the book, too, it's really worth it. The lessons are simple, and the book is well written. It teaches you proper technique, how to read notes, and how to play simple songs. I don't think it teaches chords--I'm not sure. But I'm not ready for chords, anyway.

If you have no idea how to play, and want to learn, then this is for you.",1338336000,,585,4.168141592920354
