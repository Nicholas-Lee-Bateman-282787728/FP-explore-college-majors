Even my mother, who is 81 has fond memories of watching this show with my daughter. This series made a great impact on our now grown children. It taught them to be kind, share, love and respect. This show is unforgettable.",983145600,6,365,4.154929577464789
8299320,5,6303627773,I can not believe I actually found these videos.  As a child I grew up watching them and learning more about how the world works just as Jeff would.  Today's Special is a timeless classic that I still cherish to this day.  I encourage everyone to buy a video and relive your childhood memories or share them with your children and watch the magic in thier eyes.,979430400,3,361,4.358208955223881
8299321,5,6303627773,"I loved watching these videos with my brother growing up. After I had kids, I wanted to find videos from my childhood because they were  educational and fun to watch. I finally found several copies of Today's  Special and bought them. It was the best thing I could have bought!  My son  adores them!  He watches them every day sometimes several times a day. He  is even getting good at singing the opening song. We spend many happy hours  singing along to the videos and playing the quizzes. He is learning alot  from them and I recommend them for any child who wants to learn and have  fun. These videos are a treasure to have in any household and great for the  entire family. My husband thought I was nuts because he had never heard of  them. But now he watches them and agrees that they are wonderful!  Jodie,  Jeff, Muffy, and Sam bring to life stories that will never grow old. We  give them two thumbs up!",967075200,8,912,4.351190476190476
