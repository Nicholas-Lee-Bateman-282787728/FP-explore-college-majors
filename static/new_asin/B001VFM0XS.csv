3822141,5,B001VFM0XS,"My 7 year old son gave this movie 5 stars. He's watching it right now - again - and laughing. What's not to like? A ghost, pirates, hidden treasure, kid heroes, idiot bad guys, action, suspense, friendship, humor, lessons learned, and of course the lovable Labou.",1245283200,9,263,4.739130434782608
3822142,5,B001VFM0XS,"Labou is definitely going to become a new children's classic movie. It combines all the great elements of classic movies. There is adventure, comedy, pirates, and buried treasure. It has a G rating so it is suitable for any age and also has a good moral lesson. I'm a teacher and showed it to my second grade class and they absolutely loved it. I recommend it to any parent or teacher who wants an engaging entertaining movie that has a great story. I loved that it was set and shot in New Orleans. The setting added a little something more to the film. Overall, just a great film!",1244073600,4,581,4.388888888888889
3822143,5,B001VFM0XS,I almost didn't get this movie but since it's a Kids First I did.  And I am so glad.  I am in constant search for kid movies that have African American role models.  I LOVED that the smartest character in this whole movie was an African American boy.  The creature was adorable and my 6 kids have already watched it 7 times.,1243555200,4,324,4.17741935483871
3822144,1,B001VFM0XS,"Overall, a disappointing movie with bad acting, poor continuity, and sub-par special effects. The Labou animatronic is reminiscent of a 1980's Teddy Ruxpin. More disturbing are the lessons that your child might learn from this film, such as: It's OK to mutilate a library book, particularly if it is the only copy in existence. And it's OK to wander around for 2 days in a swamp near New Orleans (the city with the highest rate of overall crime in the country) without any adult supervision.",1243296000,4,491,4.788235294117647
3822145,5,B001VFM0XS,"If you grew up in the 80's like I did, share this movie with your kids! It's a fun romp in the genre that created such classics as The Goonies, Gremlins, and Adventures in Babysitting. A heartwarming story about friendship and adventure, the whole family can enjoy it. And the creature is so cute! I hope they make stuffed animal versions!",1239235200,2,339,4.573770491803279

3822166,4,B001VFM0XS,My kids really enjoyed this movie (aged 4 and 7). Although it can be a bit cheesy in parts it gets them involved in a new adventure and if they like pirates they will really enjoy this.,1359158400,,185,4.027027027027027
3822167,5,B001VFM0XS,This is one of my 7 yr. old granddaughter's favorite movies.  She never seems to tire of watching it. The movie touches on how important it is to take care of our planet which I really liked.  Highly recommend!,1358121600,2,210,4.358974358974359
3822168,4,B001VFM0XS,"I choose this for my grand kids.  I watched it first and although it had a lot of ""corn pone"" it kept a good story line.  the younger ones raved about how good it was.  The magic the animations brought set it off.",1355443200,,213,3.9069767441860463
3822169,5,B001VFM0XS,I have yet to meet a kid that didn't enjoy this movie.  Watched partially with several classes and they cant' wait to finish it.  Being in Southwest Louisiana and raised here I am always looking got something fun and entertaining from or about our state to teach my kids or students.,1350086400,,283,4.529411764705882
3822170,4,B001VFM0XS,"It was a cute enough story which my grandchildren (ages 5 & 6) really enjoyed. They've watched it a few times already, choosing IT over any other movie. I liked it ok, too, although it was a bit silly and predictable as are so many family movies. Watching it the one time was MORE than enough for ME. LOL",1286064000,2,304,4.169491525423729
3822171,5,B001VFM0XS,My grandkids love this movie.  Delivery was quick and the item was in excellent condition!!,1282176000,,91,5.066666666666666
3822172,4,B001VFM0XS,"My eight year old boy LOVED this movie.  He thought Labou was ADORABLE and thought the high jinks in the story were hilarious.  As a parent, I did NOT like how the one boy seemed to be saying things like ""Idiot!"" and ""Losers!"" to the other kids.  He was a total brat for most of the movie.  Adults and teens would see that he was ""all talk"" but younger kids wouldn't catch on to it. They would just see a mean kid who the other two kids continue wanting to be friends with.

But all in all, it is fairly harmless and has a ""save the environment"" theme because the little creature Labou is in danger of losing his habitat.  So the kids end up trying to find the treasure AND save the swamp.  Fairly simplistic plot but enjoyable for my 8 year old.

My son is afraid of ghosts but was not scared by Captain LaRouge, except for a couple times that he jumped out unexpectedly.  I was happy about this because oftentimes he gets scared after seeing movies or shows dealing with ghosts.

My son was so taken with this movie that we have already ordered a t-shirt with Labou's picture on it.  He was very disappointed that we could not order a Labou stuffed animal.  :)",1267747200,4,1162,4.255707762557078
3822173,5,B001VFM0XS,"This is very entertaining kid's movie. My 10 year olds enjoyed it, so to me that is all that counts.",1263772800,,100,4.05
3822174,1,B001VFM0XS,"I really expected this to be better.  The acting was TERRIBLE and one of the first scenes of the movie is the mayor of New Orleans involved in what seems like a very shady deal.  The lessons to children are also very questionable.  Three kids (about 12 yrs old) alone in the swamps of new orleans in the dark!  The plot of this story is fabulous I only wish that it had been done better!  So as an adult I really disliked this movie, however my 5 year old son thought it was cute.  Even if we did have to interject from time to time to remind him what was inappropriate.",1259107200,2,570,4.09009009009009
3822175,3,B001VFM0XS,Movie is well worth the watch.  Gives the pirate theme but doesn't give your kids a nightmare.  Something the family can watch more than once,1246924800,2,141,4.6
