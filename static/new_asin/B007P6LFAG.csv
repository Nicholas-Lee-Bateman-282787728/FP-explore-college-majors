8520193,4,B007P6LFAG,"Hell has a lot of bonafied heroes running loose in the over-the-top, `hell bent for leather' action film ""The Expendables""; starring Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Stallone, Austin, Crews, Rourke, Roberts, Schwarzenegger, and Willis; co-written/directed by Stallone; co-written by David Callaham. If Dante had thought of better ways to stir up a hornet's nest in the Inferno - he might have sought an exit plan that involved recruiting this team of mercenaries, martial artists, and hardcore tough guys - who enjoy going into a small foreign country, tearing the place up, and rescuing a single woman (Sandra, played by Gisele Iti). All to prove it can be done, and because the despot-tyrant (General Garza, played by David Zayas) who is in charge of the sadistic army in that little country - needs to be dethroned and the people under his severe rulership - rescued from his cruelty. The themes of 'freedom & tyranny' run clean and straight. Rourke elevates the film by telling a tragic story and how it deeply affected him as a man of war.

It is solid, straightforward, nihilistic and robust `mercenary work' replete with high-end cinematography, low-end dialogue scripting, to-the-bone acting by several truly deadly warriors (in their own right), and non-stop 'hellion warfare' - once the odds are stacked against our heroes - and they opt to fulfill their own sense of noblesse oblige and go into that 'hell-hole' and set those good people free. Similar to the western classic ""The Magnificent Seven"" with Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen recruiting 'guns and killers' to ride down into a Mexican town and set free villagers who are plagued, humiliated, and routinely shot dead for disobeying a band of deadly outlaws. This film rinses clean in the end. It is a satisfying, old fashioned, profane retelling of the John Sturges' classic, which in turn was based on Akira Kurosawa's ""The Seven Sumarai"" with one of the most famous action heroes in cinema history, Toshiro Mifune.

All unities adhered to. Empathy runs strong on the `macho' dial-up. This is a `beer & sausage' movie if ever there was one.",1333411200,,2107,5.017142857142857
