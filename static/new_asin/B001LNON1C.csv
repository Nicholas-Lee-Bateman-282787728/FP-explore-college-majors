8339651,4,B001LNON1C,This is a transfer from a 16mm film copy but is much better picture and sound than I expected. The film is better known in it's full version in the UK as Dial 999 and was critically acclaimed and is one of Montgomery Tully's best thrillers of the era. If the transfer was perfect it would deserve a 5 star rating.,1392508800,,313,4.147540983606557
