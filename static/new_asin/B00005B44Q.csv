1420696,4,B00005B44Q,"CAN WE FIX IT?  YES WE CAN! is the rallying cry for Bob the Builder and his friends, including his cat Pilchard.  At age 2 1/2, my son LOVES this video, and he asked for it daily for several days after I had to return it to the library.
The characters are funny, and the episodes teach cooperation and respecting others.
The characters are not annoying at all.  I enjoy watching Bob the Builder myself.

7936548,4,B00005B44Q,authentic reproduction of the fun and follies associated with coping with pets and their owners. Malcolm Welshman's fiction conveys the veterinary surgeons'surface serenity beneath which exists a daily practice of quite and sometimes  extreme desperation. Very engaging.

This winning entry in the ""Bob the Builder"" series is terrific for kids and has enough charm and appeal that even adults can enjoy it.

 ""Bob the Builder: Pets in a Pickle"" is a delightful addition to anyone's DVD collection.",1090368000,2,383,5.063492063492063
7936552,5,B00005B44Q,"My two-year-old absolutely adores Bob the Builder. We play together frequently with his BTB toys and vehicles, recreating scenes from the videos or inventing new situations. The videos in general are excellent, but this is my personal favorite. The stories are fairly complex for a 2-year-old but deeply engaging. (""Can We Fix It?"" is also excellect.) Usually we watch it together and comment on what's happening, but it's also valuable that he's happy to watch it by himself so that I can get some quiet time to feed the baby or put her to sleep (my wife is often out in the evenings). No harm in letting your child watch some wholesome programming on his own so long as you don't let him overdo it. I guess ""A Viewer from France"" would have to have a child to understand this.",1048723200,5,778,4.564285714285714
