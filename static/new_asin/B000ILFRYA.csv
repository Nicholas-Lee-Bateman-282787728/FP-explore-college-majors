8146050,4,B000ILFRYA,"This dvd presents Karloff and Lugosi, each in a film that is not part of their usual fare seen in other collections.

THE INVISIBLE MENACE is a Warner Brother's quickie (clocking in at under 60 minutes) that shows that Boris Karloff could do far more than play monsters.  Most reviews of this film write it off as a poor example of his talents.
I disagree.  In it's 54 minute running time it manages to combine murder, red herrings, and an extremely quick paced mystery.  The comedic antics of Marie Wilson and Eddie Craven may be a bit trying at times for those looking for pure mystery, but they are far less intrusive than many other mystery films where comedy is injected at random.  At least their situation is part of the plot.
As to Boris's role being  beneath him, I tend to look at it as an extension of his abilities to create a character. His gray hair, glasses and quiet manner (except when he is gesturing wildly pleading for justice) are a precursor to his role as Professor Linden in The Linden Tree, which he would play on the New York stage in the late 1940's.
Overall it is an enjoyable little film.

The second feature, with the generic title NIGHT OF TERROR, comes as a welcome surprise.  I had only seen it listed on Bela Lugosi film bibliographies.
It is a variation on the old dark house thriller, with moving panels, tunnels, a gathering of heirs for the reading of the will, etc.
This film has the advantage of Lugosi's performance.
Reading other reviews of the film led me to believe that he was ""wasted"" in the part of Degar.  Once again I tend to disagree.  Bela is in almost every scene of the picture.  His mysterious delivery of his dialogue is perfectly in line with the film's eerie atmosphere.  As for him being ""wasted"" he turns out to be the most intelligent person of the lot-including the police and a wise cracking newspaper reporter.
Being a B picture, and over the years being subject to scrutiny, the plot discrepancies are pretty evident, but overall it is an entertaining film.
As to the peculiar ending, it is no more quirky that Edward Van Sloan's prologue to FRANKENSTEIN or his epilogue to DRACULA (cut from most prints of the film.)",1162771200,2,2181,4.549872122762149
