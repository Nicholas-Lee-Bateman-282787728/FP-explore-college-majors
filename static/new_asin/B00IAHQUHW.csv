6255673,1,B00IAHQUHW,Couldn't get it to play.  I saw about 3 minutes of it and then it started downloading again.  Wouldn't download after that.,1402185600,,123,4.545454545454546
6255674,1,B00IAHQUHW,"This was torture. Between the trailer and the average rating on Amazon, I was fooled into thinking it would be decent. I have no idea how people rated  5 stars. Besides the many inconsistencies and utter ludicrous-ness of the plot, the decisions being made, the film quality baaad. Suffice to say you were warned. I refuse to spend more time on this flick.",1400976000,2,356,4.650793650793651
6255675,2,B00IAHQUHW,Originally called Portrait of a Zombie. Check those reviews first before purchase. Great idea but really poor execution. I wouldn't recommend unless you are really bored.,1398816000,,170,5.576923076923077
6255676,2,B00IAHQUHW,"This movie was just annoying, weird and the characters were such idiots. Plus, it didn't make sense most of the time. I watched it with a few friends and everyone was confused and annoyed as well. The only reason we kept watching was because I rented it and forced everyone to watch it with me, which I feel badly about. Now everyone thinks I have terrible taste in movies!",1398643200,,373,4.420289855072464
6255677,5,B00IAHQUHW,"Not just your average zombie flick. Part of the movie consists of an older married couple, and their son, who has turned and is kept in a room in the house, with a device over his mouth and secured in a straightjacket. What makes it so pathetic is his mother, who can't accept the fact that that isn't her son anymore. Then there are the mobsters, who gets involved and becomes like heroes, refusing to give in to their fate. It takes place in a town in Ireland, and as more and more unfortunates are attacked and partially devoured, a camera crew, headed by an American seek out fame and fortune by filming the soulless creatures. This movie is the most violent of its kind that I've seen yet, but the script and acting are very good and chilling.
Watch it, if you dare.",1398297600,3,771,4.361111111111111
6255678,5,B00IAHQUHW,"There have been a lot of entries in the zombie movie genre over the past few years but this film does something original in making the zombie film focus around a family drama/documentary. Its a strange fusion of genres, a hybrid. In ways it has a connection to The Exorcist but with much more humor and plenty of stomach churning gore. I was surprised by this film a lot as I didn't know what to expect. Some parts disturbed the hell out of me for days.
Overall I would recommend this film to anyone who has seen everything in horror before and wants to see something unique.",1398124800,,575,4.383177570093458
6255679,3,B00IAHQUHW,"after (Dawn of the Dead 2003) ..nothing really compares as far as, big budget action...this,... while filmed well,... well made, acting good and believeible, special effects and so forth were really good...it was just 2 borring for me....and it was a bit silly...but overall boring...the 5 star reviews must come from the production team.",1397088000,5,338,5.277777777777778
6255680,5,B00IAHQUHW,"The DVD cover for this film, ABOUT A ZOMBIE, is a perfect example of how to draw me to a movie: put a gory, vicious-looking zombie on the front, and Im pretty much hooked. I know, I knowyou cant judge a book (or a movie) by its cover, but at least a zombie in the artwork gets my hopes up. Im happy to report this one lives up to its awesome movie cover, too. ABOUT A ZOMBIE is a brutal living dead flick that will rip your throat out and show it to you!

This movie has all the elements of a great zombie flick: good story, good zombie effects, and great gore. I will admit the zombie make-up on a couple of the extras could have been better, but you only see them in passing so its not a big deal. Otherwise, this is just about a perfect horror film.

ABOUT A ZOMBIE is shot well and is told from a couple of different viewpoints. Most of the story is told from the documentary filmmakers cameras. But there are a couple of scenes that use traditional third-person perspective shots, specifically when none of the filmmakers are around. This might sound odd, but it works well, and the transition from one to the other in the film is seamless.

The special effects are excellent, and theres plenty of gore to satiate the heartiest of gore-hounds. My sole complaint here is that most of the gunshot muzzle flashes are CG, and the animation looks a bit cheap. But as far as I can tell, most (if not all) of the zombie effects and gore are practical. Theres even an exceptionally brutal and gory scene when a zombie tears into a womans pregnant belly; this has to be seen to be appreciated (if you can stomach it!).

The acting in ABOUT A ZOMBIE is good, too. I am particularly impressed with the work of Rory Mullen and Geraldine McAlinden, who portray the parents in the film. Both give stirring performances as two people who love their son so much that they are blind to his condition. Their realism in their roles help to bring an air of credibility to the film.

ABOUT A ZOMBIE is a big win for me, and I highly suggest you give it a look. Its nice to see zombies done by other countries besides the U.S., and this Irish take is certainly worthy of praise. The film is available now.",1396915200,7,2188,4.288135593220339
6255681,5,B00IAHQUHW,"This film is fascinating, it draws you in and you can't look away.  It takes a bit to get going but once you're hooked, there's no turning back.  Disturbing, suspenseful and funny, it also tugs at your heartstrings and makes social statements that everyone can relate to.  Very good writing and interesting subplots as well.",1396828800,6,324,4.8545454545454545
6255682,4,B00IAHQUHW,"This flick is a talky bend on the zombie genre that no only gets under your skin but offers some nice social commentary.  Any zombie fan will appreciate the genre-bending that happens here.  And calling it talky isn't a negative.  It's told in mockumentary style, so interviews are a large part of the film, but they are funny and very well written.  This isn't a dumb zombie romp.  It's a zombie flick for people who dig Romero.  You know who you are.",1396742400,12,452,4.451219512195122
8640421,1,B00IAHQUHW,"Not at all what I expected, and not in a good way. I lost interest quickly. It was a stinker of a movie with characters who were hard to like or care about---even if you were able to keep track of who they were. Waste of money; very disappointed.",1417392000,2,246,4.040816326530612

8640423,3,B00IAHQUHW,I was disappointed in this movie because it had a lot of potential. I didn't like the interview style with the characters and was often confused and not sure where I was with the movie.,1409788800,2,185,4.314285714285714

8640425,3,B00IAHQUHW,"This strange zombie movie  As the credits rolled at the end, I was left feeling one of those mixed feelings  You know what I am talking about right?  Partly fulfilled, partly confused, and admittedly, a small part disappointed altogether.  This movie, while not unique in its engagement, is told from a documentary perspective, in a world that is adjusting to the dead walking the earth.  A film crew has chosen a family of one young man, who of course turned into a zombie.  He lives with his family, chained to the bed, where his mother seems oblivious to the fact he is rotting away before her eyes.  (The feeding is pretty gruesome!)  Additional subplots include a fianc, who just happens to pregnant and siblings who loathe life in the house with their zombie-brother.  The climatic ending makes it all worthwhile, although it is not necessarily what I had expected.  All in all, I would recommend this for a rental; especially for fans of the genre.",1407196800,2,955,4.733333333333333
8640426,2,B00IAHQUHW,"This film is done documentary style and is heavy into interviews. The movie opens with glimpses of news headlines. We know the meat is tainted. People have a virus and eat flesh and something about the Goat's Head pub.

We discover the Murphy family wants to care for their son Billy, who as been turned into a zombie. This causes problems with the neighbors who want all zombies dead and gone. While the film has some zombie action, it is at a painfully slow pace.

No subtitles.

8640427,3,B00IAHQUHW,"First off to say I have been watching zombie movies since about five years old so over the course of fiteen and a half years I know my way around a good, okay, and bad zombie movie. This one was okay. The acting not the best I have seen but I got into it some if I imagined placing myself as one of the people going through it. The setting was sort of bad I would have liked to see more of the zombies going around instead of all interviews for the entire movie. Seeing the interviews is fine but your movie cannot be just based on that. The make-up was  B- I could see some of the make-up was plain old eye make-up some more blending and blood in some areas could have covered this up. As for the story I got the point where they were coming from and what they wanted to do but the story needed more going into what had happened. In a zombie movie, and any movie, you need to know what might have caused the out break and in this case besides meat. Did Billy infect others by eating them or did the meat infect others as well? How did he get to the hosptial did someone find him or did his parents? Because I watched and listened so unless I missed something the story needed more to it unless they make a two.",1406937600,2,1211,4.024896265560166
8640428,4,B00IAHQUHW,"A great movie with lots of disturbing images.  Great social commentary on family dynamics, the power of denial,  and how easily we humans can get so wrapped up in our own little lives that we can ignore how our actions impact the world we live in.",1404172800,,247,4.3478260869565215
8640429,1,B00IAHQUHW,"I haven't even watched all of it, because I became bored.  Maybe I'll try it again, but aside from ""Shaun of The a Dead""
the British Isles have yet to make a good Zombie flick, IMHO.",1402704000,,182,4.055555555555555
8640430,2,B00IAHQUHW,"One of those ""socially conscience"" movies.  Not really my wife or I's cup O' Tea.  There was a Zombie outbreak at the end.  But by then we were pretty much done.",1402358400,,161,4.129032258064516
