8503794,5,B006SPZ060,I bought this a while ago and it was worth it. The exercise here is great for new people. I began seeing results with in the first three weeks.,1362787200,4,143,3.9655172413793105
8503795,2,B006SPZ060,"I got this set hoping it would give me something different.  The preview was motivating and inspiring.  I felt having a personal trainer advise you is much better than some model showing you some of their routines they have learned.  When I viewed the tape, I realized it is mostly geared for men and you need heavy weights or gym equipment to do them.  Spending almost $100.00 for DVD and still needing to buy equipment, I was not interested.  At least mention it at the beginning so the consumer won't be disappointed.  I will give it to my husband I guess.",1337817600,25,559,4.485148514851486

8503797,1,B006SPZ060,"As I pop in the first disk I'm listening and getting hype to workout, but soon as I see the start of the workout I read bench press.. WHAT!!! I buy a dvd to do at home workouts not gym workouts. Don't recommend at all, unless you have a gym membership. I mean what else is the point of a dvd? To watch and do the exercises at home!
