3112312,3,B0013J30YU,"Forget about Mike Myers for a minute. Let's begin with Ben Kingsley, the Oscar winning actor who actually appears in ""The Love Guru""; he plays a cross-eyed spiritual advisor from India, and his name is not a double entendre so much as it's a blatant sexual reference smushed into a single word. The sight of this man is hilarious, and yet I didn't want to laugh because I know that Kingsley has made so many better choices than this film. What possessed him to act in a film this unashamedly juvenile? Did he find the idea of nonstop [...] gags appealing? I might as well be asking myself the same questions, because in all honesty, ""The Love Guru"" often had me giggling like a six-year-old who heard his first dirty joke. But to call this movie a comedic masterpiece would be an insult to the very concept of comedy.

The plot focuses on Pitka (Myers), an American-born, Indian-raised guru who was taught by Kingsley's character to become an expert in matters of love. How, I'm not entirely sure; he was forced to put on a metal chastity belt at the age of twelve, and there it would stay until he learned how to love himself above all others. Be that as it may, he's now a world-renowned spiritual advisor, guiding hundreds of followers with his bits of wisdom. He even attracts celebrities like Mariska Hargitay, and that's really interesting because her name doubles as his blessing for peace, love, and tranquility. But for all his fame and fortune, Pitka feels empty inside because he's only the second most famous guru. The first, of course, is Deepak Chopra. There is, however, a way for Pitka to increase his popularity: he must heal a troubled relationship between a Hockey player and his wife, who left him for another Hockey player. If Pitka can help them, he will be secured a guest spot on Oprah's show.

This opportunity arises because of Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba), owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs; the team's star player, Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), broke up with his wife, Prudence (Meagan Good), and as a result, his Hockey skills have been waning. This shouldn't be a problem for Pitka, who's always ready with a slew of sayings hidden within acronyms. Examples: GURU is short for Gee, You Are You, and BIBLE is short for Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. He also has published a number of self-help books with such inspiring titles as ""If You're Happy and You Know It, Think Again,"" and ""Does it Hurt When You Do That? Don't Do That."" He introduces himself to Darren by rolling in on a motorized pillow and telling him that his wife has forgiven him. Low and behold, Darren's practice shots improve dramatically; Pitka then understands that the key to Darren's success is about distraction, not merely about reconciling a feuding couple.

Thus begins a strict regiment of spiritual guidance. Darren's first big obstacle is his wife's new boyfriend, a French-Canadian Hockey player named Jacque Grande (Justin Timberlake). His talent is huge, much like his ... well, let's just say that there's a reason this man is so fond of roosters. Darren's second obstacle is his mother (Telma Hopkins), whose loveable face hides an incredibly overbearing personality. If Pitka can convince him to face her, he might be able to overcome years of emotional scarring. This, in turn, will bring him one step closer to patching things up with Prudence.

Intertwined with all of this is the relationship between Pitka and Jane, which steadily grows. Jane feels inadequate because of what she calls the Bullard Curse; the long and short of it is that everyone in the city blames her for the Maple Leafs' losing streak. As a result, men stay as far away from her as possible. I have a feeling the audience won't care about this subplot one bit--all anyone will notice are the film's back-to-back sexual innuendoes related to male genitalia. There are also a fair number of gags featuring the Maple Leafs' coach, an angry, foulmouthed dwarf played by Verne Troyer. You remember Verne Troyer as Mini Me from the ""Austin Powers"" sequels, don't you? The dwarf jokes in those films wore thin after a while. The same can be said in the case of ""The Love Guru."" Truth be told, every joke wears thin at a certain point.

But I can't deny the fact that I laughed every now and then. Consider cameo appearances by Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan as sports announcers--they add nothing meaningful to the story, yet their one-liners are so outlandish that I found myself smiling. I'm not exactly proud of myself for that. I know that there are much better comedies out there, ones that don't begin and end with musical numbers and feature two elephants having sex in a Hockey rink. Again, I turn my attention back to Ben Kingsley, who chose to play a cross-eyed Indian despite his accomplished career: Did that same guilty laughter haunt him as he read the script? Was he actually tempted by the idea of telling masturbation jokes to audiences of immature teenagers? Maybe so, because goodness knows I wasn't strong enough to completely resist it. There's absolutely no good reason to see ""The Love Guru,"" even if you think you will find it funny.",1213920000,11,5150,4.762597984322508
3112313,3,B0013J30YU,"After viewing this film...I was left wondering where the funny Mike Myers was.  The film is about a guru who is a guide to a young hockey player's love life, but has never been in love himself.  It is the job of the guru to help the hockey player (played by  Malco) with his love life as well as his professional life.  I found the humor to be recycled jokes and puns that could have been better presented.  The humor from the Guru (books with long titles, telling people intimacy means 'into me I see', and making jokes about jacking off to an elephant) just didn't cut it for me.  I spent over an hour waiting to crack a smile.
 The same goes for Vern Troy's parts.  I suppose I was expecting the duo to do the same magic they did in Austin Powers.  He played the Maple Leafs manager and had a micro office that four other characters tried to squeeze into.  That scene was funny. Troyer's part had a number of short jokes (him being offered shrimp during dinner, and being called a gnome when 'name' was meant)and stunts, but again, not much to laugh about.

Jessica Alba played the owner of the T.O Maple Leafs and towards the end her indian dance moves reminded me of what I saw in 'The Guru'. It was lovely and colorful choreograpy. Not much can be said about her character; a nice woman who's team was cursed until the guru came along.

Justin Timberlake played a not-so-funny french hockey player who was known as Le coq (for his large penis).  I understood some of the french humor and curse words used, but again was not impressed. Particularly with the fight scene between he and the guru.

As for Romany Malco it was great to see him in a more interesting role where he's not swearing constantly.  I remember him from 'The Chateau' and never thought I'd see him again.  He played a broken-hearted hockey player who was afraid to contront his mother (played by Thelma Hopkins).

The critics were correct.  It leaves the viewer wanting more movie for thier money.",1213920000,5,1972,4.445682451253482
3112314,5,B0013J30YU,"Reading some of these reviews, i think people are taking the movie for something it is not. This is a slapstick comedy, with similar adult humor you came to enjoy in Austin Powers. Mike Myers was a joy to watch and listen to. I laughed the entire time. If you didn't like a single one of the Austin Powers, then save yourself the time and stay away from this movie. You won't get it, nor will you enjoy it. For everybody else...WATCH IT!!!

The star-studded cast took a bite out of traditional reality to bring us a childishly-fun ride; this movie contains a hilarious look at the guru genre, and pokes fictional fun at several stars including Deepak Chopra. Guru Pitka (Mike Myers) was an American child raised by a temple of monks (with hilariously dirty names) along side Deepak Chopra, however Guru Pitka never actually learned the full concepts of his teaching and was chastised. Years later Guru Pitka is found to be in competition with Deepak, and devises a plan to becoming a guest on the Oprah Winfrey; which he believes will lead him to national stardom.

3112357,1,B0013J30YU,"Holy insert-your-favorite-expletive-here, this is a BAD movie.  Not so bad it's hilarious like ""The Room,"" not so bad it's bound to be a legend in awfulness like ""Manos: The Hands of Fate.""  More like ""so bad I think I lost brain cells watching this thing.""  And the worst part?  I watched this movie on the recommendation of MY MOTHER, who said that was raunchy but hilarious and that despite the off-color humor there were some genuinely sweet moments and good lessons on maintaining relationships.  Note to self, just because your mother likes a movie doesn't mean it's quality...

""The Love Guru"" follows a guru named Pitka (played by Mike Meyers), who has millions of followers and lives a wealthy life from his relationship-based self-help programs... but who dreams of gaining a spot on Oprah's show and bears a deep grudge against Deepak Chopra for being the ""#1 Guru in the world.""  When Jane, the owner of a Canadian hockey team (Jessica Alba) recruits Pitka's aid in solving the marital woes of her star hockey player so he can help them win the Stanley Cup, he sees his chance to win Jane's heart and the spot of #1 guru, and leaps right in.  But his battle to win Jane's heart and break the player out of his funk will pit him against a well-endowed rival player (Justin Timberlake), his client's overbearing mother, and his own insecurities... and result in supposedly-funny hijinks.

Yes, I say supposedly funny -- this film is very deeply NOT funny.  Almost every gag relies on a tired pop-culture reference that dates incredibly quickly, racist/sexist jokes, or  sexual or toilet humor.  I'm no prude who demands all humor be squeaky clean, but at the same time sex, urine, farts, and other such subjects are not funny on their own -- they have to be used cleverly.  There is nothing funny about an Indian guru making his students fight with urine-soaked mops, elephants having sex in front of a captive audience, or a character whose entire personality revolves around his... ahem, physical endowments.  Also, this film is so incredibly racist when it comes to Indian and Hindu culture that I'm surprised there wasn't more of an outcry from the Indian community.  When a movie's only genuinely funny moment comes from a blooper included in the end credits, something has gone terribly wrong.

I'm not a huge fan of Mike Myers, but I harbored no special hatred for him either.  But boy, this film came close to making me loathe the man and everything he's involved in.  While he's genuinely funny in ""Wayne's World"" and the ""Shrek"" films (I haven't seen ""Austin Powers""), here he's given carte blanche with the story and jokes... and it's not a pretty sight.  Someone really needed to reel in his cruder and dumber jokes, and tell him that just throwing in an endless stream of vulgar humor and celebrity cameos isn't going to make a film work.  And speaking of cameos... it's highly embarrassing watching genuinely decent actors and personalities like Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Val Kilmer, Stephen Colbert, and Deepak Chopra make fools of themselves in this movie.  Did they really need the money that bad or did Myers have some kind of dirt on their pasts to blackmail them with...

To sum up -- this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I find I can't really recommend it to anyone.  Not to Myers fans (watch ""Wayne's World"" instead), not fans of bad films (watch ""The Room"" or ""Southland Tales"" instead), and certainly not to anyone's mother (thank heavens my own mom has since reversed her opinion on this movie and now despises it).  Avoid at all costs.",1494028800,,3594,4.768982229402262

3112361,2,B0013J30YU,"Mike Myers (""Austin Powers,"" ""Wayne's World"") stars in this satire of New Age self-help. He's an Indian guru Pitka who's a star for his cheesy acronym-laden advice, but wants to get to the next level. He sees his chance when the owner of a hockey team (Jessica Biel) wants him to help one of her star players who's devastated about his girl leaving him. Myers has to get the player back together to get his girl so the player will start hitting pucks again.

This was Mike Myers' attempt to start a new franchise and re-launch his career. It may just have killed his career instead. This movie was just so horribly misguided. It was everything terrible about Austin Powers and none of the things we liked.

I think this movie started with Myers going through his bag of accents to see which ones he could build a character out of: ""My British accent worked last time. I do a good Indian accent, let's do that."" But the idea of a white man playing an Indian guru is just such a bad idea that it should have killed the movie. Then they doubled-down by deciding to put a prosthetic hooked nose on Myers to make him look ""Indian,"" even though Pitka is supposed to be a white man adopted in India. When the movie opens with Pitka playing ""9 to 5"" on a sitar while riding around on elephants and fringed pillows, the racism crosses from kind of funny to flat-out offensive.

Besides the racism, the movie tries so hard to offend people, which I don't like. It's one thing to do edgy humor, but another to do humor just for the sake of being offensive. ""Love Guru"" has probably the most jokes about male anatomy of any comedy I've seen. For example, Justin Timberlake plays Jacque LeCoque, a well-endowed rival who is one of the few bright spots of the movie, even if his role is just a bunch of penis jokes. At a certain point, I felt like ""okay, we get it. Find another source of humor.""

I also felt like Myers only added the role of the coach (Verne Troyer) so he could make fun of him, since the coach's role existed almost entirely on short jokes.

All of the above could have been okay if the movie itself was funny, and it's just not. The tone is all over the place with jokes thrown at the screen every few seconds and very few of them are actually good. I did think a couple jokes were good, but they weren't worth grinding through the unfunny parts.

On the whole, ""Love Guru"" was a terrible movie with a terrible idea and a terrible story that wasn't very funny. I really hope Myers gets to make another movie, because he's a really funny guy. Maybe he'll do a better job next time.",1490832000,,2587,4.345755693581781

3112383,1,B0013J30YU,"This is one of those movies you really only need to see once. I originally saw it in the theaters, and while it has a ton of famous cameos, none of them play a part in the plot. It was an excuse to get people to the theaters. The plot is ridiculous. Mike Myers should not have been allowed to write his own jokes for this movie. They feel stale, boring, confusing, and just plain bad. The songs are silly and stupid at the same time, making you hate yourself a little each time you make a slight chuckle at them. It could have been an amazing movie, if they didn't give Myers carte blanche with the jokes and plot. There are definitely a few moments that were worth seeing but overall nearly everything in it was a bad choice. I actually really like Mike Myers and enjoy most of his other movies (Wayne's World 1 and 2, So I Married an Axe Murderer, all the Austin Powers) but this movie just can't stand on its' own two feet without putting its figurative head up it's butt (see attached actual screenshot from the movie). If you are a hardcore Mike Myers fan, you owe it to yourself to sit awkwardly for two hours through this film, so when someone else brings up how bad it was you can agree with them instead of defending Myers' arguably worst movie ever. 5 minutes in and I was already regretting watching this a second time in my life.",1486339200,7,1341,4.262745098039216

Movies generally have: a plot, characters that are distinguishable and/or relate-able, a lesson / moral / solved mystery or case - basically the viewer learns something by the end, and should also be compelling enough to hold you to the end. None of these things existed in The Love Guru. There is no plot - just a jumbled series of events that happens in no particular order. The characters are one dimensional, and Mike Myer's character is crude and obnoxious, only capable of using offensive / disgusting middle-school humor. The only reason  I sat through the whole thing was because I was shocked at how this movie was the OPPOSITE of a movie in every way, and I couldn't believe that this was something that actually made it to the big screen, let alone past the idea-phase of planning.

The story feels like a pretext to let Myers try his hand at creating another lovable funny weird character, but it comes across as ethnically tone deaf and even insulting in some instances. If the film was a laugh riot this could be overlooked (perhaps), but since it isn't, it is baffling anyone would think this was something a wide audience would want to see. The biggest mystery by far is why an actor of the stature and intelligence of Ben Kingsley would be in this film, in a role that is humiliating, unfunny, and racist. I liked Austin Powers, and although the comedy in The Love Guru is of the same style, it fails miserably for the reasons mentioned. It is such a bad film it is actually interesting to watch to see how consistently wrong/stupid/racist/idiotic it got as it went on.",1485475200,,862,4.532051282051282

The jokes and word plays got more and more obvious and less and less funny as the movie went on.  I like the people in it, but there was nothing there to offset the childish potty humor and make it worth seeing it through.  It crossed the threshold from funny to cheap pretty early on and didn't seem like it was going to get better.  We've got limited 'grown-up' viewing time and this wasn't worth it.  I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because a) I tend not to hate things, and that's the Amazon definition of 1 star, and b) there may have been some redemptive value if we'd gotten through the whole thing, but we only watched as much as we did because of the train wreck effect.",1484784000,,963,4.305555555555555

The plot was garbage.  The acting was garbage.  The comedy was garbage.  The characters were garbage.  The entire movie was garbage.  The one and only redeeming quality was the fact it was a AAA big-budget movie with high-quality video and sound.

This movie was so lazily thrown together that it had skits and bits that were exact copies of bits that cast members had done in other movies.  Remember that thing Mike Meyers did in Austin Powers 3 where he kicked both of his legs behind his head?  Yeah, he does literally the very same thing in this movie.

The endless dick jokes, cliched shallow characters, in short almost everything was pointless.

It seems anyone that hates this film only hates it because they either got offended, found it's comedy inappropriate or just flat out they don't like comedy movies to start with.

3112939,1,B0013J30YU,"Remember when Mike Myers was funny? Yeah, me neither. This movie has completely overridden any memories of comedic competence from Myers in my mind. Opening with a rousing version of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5"" on the sitar (please, no more: my ears are bleeding...,) the film promptly reveals its raison d'tre: jokes about reproductive organs and bodily functions that fifth grade boys would be embarrassed by. This movie is so truly unfunny, I don't know where to start.

While there are a couple of amusing bits skewering the whole pop-enlightenment culture (I have no idea how they actually got Deepak Chopra to be involved with this project,) e.g. presentations taking you ""from 'nowhere' to 'now-here,'"" the jokes are absolutely stultifying, but if it's scatological it's covered: I never again need to contemplate a urine mop battle, if that gives you some idea about what we're dealing with here.

There is talent aplenty on display, and an astonishing list of cameos far too lengthy for me to remember: Val Kilmer, Jessica Simpson, Kanye West, Jim Gaffigan and Stephen Colbert, just off the tip of my brain. Gaffigan and Colbert are color commentators and hockey broadcasters that get some of the funniest bits of the film (which isn't saying much,) while even Oprah (!) gets a moment of glory to bask in. Likewise there are big names in the cast: Ben Kingsley plays the perpetually cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudha (yes, that's the level of comedy being served) and Jessica Alba represents the Toronto Maple Leafs management. Oh didn't I mention this movie is all about hockey? Sadly it is, and it's enough to make hockey fans weep. Due to a love triangle of idiotic proportions, Alba needs Guru Pitka (Myers) to help Toronto win the Stanley Cup. Just think about that concept for a second. The best performances in the film (other than Colbert and Gaffigan, who have minor recurring parts,) are from the embattled hockey arch-enemies Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) and Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake) who face off on the ice and off. Suffice it to say that Timberlake carries what little of the film he can, and is leagues ahead of Myers in comedic execution here. On the positive side, there is one joke that did make me laugh: Grande's car, which you will have to see to fully appreciate.

There's a musical number in which Myers sings ""Surely you're a goddess of love who fills my heart with lugubrious recalcitrance."" At least they got lugubrious right, anyway. When the best scene in the film is a rooster attack superimposed over Celine Dion singing you know you're in for a rocky ride.

The film is a big budget flop that lost millions and was hated by critics of every stripe, but it's clear from the sets to the cinematography that no stone was left unturned to try to make a nice looking film here. If only the material hadn't been so utterly wretched.

I would actually rather watch ""Freddy Got Fingered"" again.

My husband said in order to really get the humor in a lot of the movie, you have to watch it more than once because you hear and see things you didn't focus in on before or just didn't understand exactly what he was implying. As you watch it again, and even yet again, you become more comfortable with the characters and then start to really understand more of the humor and references because it doesn't pass by so quickly. I don't like parts of comedies going by without knowing most of what they're referencing, so I googled a bunch of names, words, and references from the movie that I didn't quite understand... and I gotta tell ya, this movie was genius and hilarious!! I can even say that I LOVE it so much that it's right up there with Jim Carrey's best! After seeing this movie over and over again, I'm still interpreting different parts in different ways and I find it just as comical as before! My husband and I are walking around quoting many parts from the movie, all day long!!! I think the critics zonked out on this one and I won't trust their ratings because I think this movie should have been at least in the top box office hits. We are also big fans of his Austin Powers and Wayne's World... and even Shrek!!!

Perhaps we find it so funny because we are into Deepak Chopra, spiritual type stuff, and music, as well as Jim Carrey; so by mixing them all, We're in Heaven! :) Rented it once, bought it immediately afterwards, then watched it at least 15 times, and ready to watch it another 15 times!!!!",1372550400,,1623,4.370860927152318

The problem with The Love Guru is that it's not funny. You can tell easily when they are trying to put in the jokes, but you're just left scratching your head. A prime example is the guru rides into a room on an electrical magic carpet. Then somebody from the set (e.g. videographer) enters the picture, gets on it, and rides off. Not funny, just pointless.

Hockey fans will probably know the name Rob Blake, during one of the breaks in the action, started taking real shots on Timberlake. (Timberlake) who plays Jaques Grande the LA Kings goaltender, started to make some saves on the Rob Blake wrist and slapshots.

From Mike Myers, creator of Wayne's World and Austin Powers, I'd expect a solid comedy, but ""The Love Guru"" was obviously not written on one of his good days (Myers and cowriter Graham Gordy ""won"" a Razzie Award for worst screenplay). The story is weak but in comedies like this the characters and jokes are often more important than the story. Unfortnately, Guru Pitka is nowhere near as funny as Austin Powers for instance, and the jokes often fall flat, with some exceptions. Ben Kingsley's talents are wasted in an unfunny role as an older guru. 1+",1283731200,2,859,4.541935483870968
3113003,2,B0013J30YU,"Mike Myers has a certain comedic equation for this particular project, ""The Love Guru"": puns + man's crotch = 86 minutes of waving it around.

Nowhere in this movie is safe from provocative play-on-words, visual aids of the nether-regions, and simple double entendres; I'm a veteran at knowing double entendres, so no word of promiscuous implication, regardless of how subdued, ever flew over my aggravated head.  That's pretty much his schtick, because...what else does he have?  He's an aged hound relying on the same old tricks: speaking to the audience and winking from ""Wayne's World"", silly acronyms that spell out a vulgar word from ""Cat In The Hat"", midget jokes from ""Austin Powers"", men gettin' their testies smashed also from ""Austin Powers"", and sing-a-longs from popular hits...""Austin Powers"" as well; in fact, this movie is a step-backward regarding sing-a-longs since Myers only mockingly sang by lyrics instead of adding his own words.  ""Austin Powers"" also did the whole 'love' puns, but the movie was never funny for that; it was funny for Dr. Evil's crazy antics.  Reattempting familiar gags for this movie doesn't make them funny, they're just old.

It's just as unfortunate, since the main character, Guru Pitka, has to carry the humor for the whole movie.  He's the exact opposite of a spiritual adviser, being a narcissistic and materialistic fool.  Despicable in obvious ways, and his childish teachings for so-called 'wisdom' is actually creepy, almost as creepy as the scenes where Myers's head in digitally-inserted in a child's body.  The side characters are a letdown; I didn't expect much from Jessica Alba who's role is metaphorically spreading her legs for the entire movie or Justin Timberlake existing for a schlong joke and a phony accent, but I'm disappointed in Romany Malco.  Malco has been a funny guy in ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and the first few seasons of ""Weeds"", but he has no stellar material for his role.  His Canadian 'Tiger Woods of Hockey' character is a straight-forward object for Pitka to interact for screen-hogging gags.

For being a ""Love Guru"" whom is out to make the world a better place, he is very perverted and crude at times... well, most of the time! He is mega-rude to the coach of the Maple Leafs, played by Verne Troyer. The chemistry between the two is piss-your-pants funny as the coach tries to even the score with the Guru he literally cannot stand the sight of, which you can't blame him for!
The announcers at the hockey arena, Justin Timberlake's character, Jessica Alba (yeah, that freak show of a guru would have a chance with her), and an unusually funny Ben Kingsley all help add some flair to this ruckus tale of a Love Guru and his quest to cleanse the world with joy and peace.

One for Worst Movie, another for Worst Screenplay, and yet another for Worst Actor, Mike Myers. It was also a certified Box Office Bomb. Now, it's things like that which usually grab my interest.

I can remember years ago reading the reviews in the papers for Mike Myers' Austin Powers movies, and the critics would almost always trash these films. When I would eventually see the movies for myself, I would enjoy them immensely. It turned out that most times a reviewer would tear apart a movie, most times I turned out to really like those movies. And this is another example of one of those movies hated by critics, but loved by me.

Mike Myers plays the character, Guru Pitka, who is a spiritual self-help Guru who longs to be the #1 Guru in the world. He is a rather silly, crude, rude, and bumbling fella who manages to get into all kinds of zany situations. Sound familiar?

Yes, Pitka is similar in a lot of respects to Myers' other famous character, Austin Powers. Myers plays the character much like he did Austin, with a sly grin, a knowing wink, and a nod to the audience, and basically hams it up for laughs all the while milking every joke for what it's worth. And ham it up he does. Which is why I love this movie.

The jokes aren't the funniest and they're nothing we haven't seen before a dozen times already, but, to see the way Mike and the rest of the cast mugs it up in their roles throughout the movie makes it all worthwhile. I found myself chuckling and giggling quite a bit at their antics. Aside from Mike Myers, Justin Timberlake and Ben Kingsley particularly seemed to really have a lot of fun with their performances.

So, if you're in the mood for some award-winning and goofy lowbrow comedy, give the Love Guru a try.",1264464000,3,1850,4.461538461538462
3113009,4,B0013J30YU,"A bunch of wisecracking comedians gather around a hockey rink in order to assist the star player of the Toronto Maple Leafs come back to his prior level of skills.  Why have his skills diminished?  Because he recently lost his girlfriend to a rival hockey player by the name of Jacque Grande, played by Justin Timberlake.  Wait, did I actually watch a film with Justin Timberlake in it?  Yes, and surprisingly, it was very good.

The story focuses around just that, Darren (played by Romany Malco), a once all-star caliber hockey player, and star player of the Maple Leafs, has begun to lose his touch in the rink.  His once legendary skills have begun to diminish, due to his recent breakup with longtime girlfriend Prudence (played by Meagan Good).  As a result of the rapid decline of the team's record, Guru Maurice Pitka (Mike Myers) is called in by the owner of the Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) to try to help Darren get his game and his girl back.

Guru Pitka is considered to be the second greatest ""love guru"" in the world.  He has written several books on the subject matter, and his ultimate goal is to appear on the Oprah show and become the number one love guru in the world.  His best shot of achieving this goal is to help Darren and the Maple Leafs reestablish themselves as a highly skilled team.  The story can be lackluster, at times, but the jokes can be quite invigorating.  Through a series of offbeat jokes and major laughs produced by not only Mike Myers, Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Verne Troyer, and Romany Malco, but also by the wisecracking announcer played by Stephen Colbert, the laughs are consistent and frequent.

Everyone in the movie seems to have something to prove, not only to themselves, but to someone else as well.  For Darren, it's proving he's more of a man than his mom thought; for Jane it's showing the fans of the Leafs that she is a competent owner; and for Guru Pitka it's much more than what he initially intended.  Many of the jokes come off as ""childish"" and immature, seeming more like jokes that junior high students would find funny, while others are actually quite good.  Mike Myers does a great job at playing the second most famous love Guru, and his humorous acronyms and abbreviations are quite unique.  Jessica Alba, as usual, is beautiful, but looks aside, she does a great job at producing a few laughs of her own.  This seemingly all-star cast did a great job despite the somewhat lacking storyline.  The blooper reel is a great special feature worth checking out as well.

3113017,3,B0013J30YU,"I fully expected to dislike this movie, in which case I wouldn't have bothered to write about it. While I like many of Mike Myers comedy instincts, I'm not keen on his saccharine observations on relationships and I just didn't think he could pull of a whole movie with ""Love"" as its explicit subject. I knew that the movie had bombed and that even many of his fans had panned this effort -- this both confirmed my thoughts that I wouldn't like the movie while strangely making me want to see what was bad enough to turn off fans and critics alike.

What I didn't know, having not been interested enough to read any of the movie reviews, was that the major plot line of the movie had as one of its two backgrounds the game of hockey. While incidental to the theme of the movie, Myers and the production team lovingly recreated the game with just the right mix of reverence and irreverence. That is to say, both the grace and the not so graceful aspects of the sport are presented with equal fervor and humor. Contrast this with the one-sided adoration of musicians versus the cartoon bad guys in ""Wayne's World"" and I would argue that Myers writing skills have improved or were at least better inspired here.

Similarly, while making fun of devotees of eastern inspired religions, the non-stop clever acronyms, double-entendres and sayings have enough truth and heart in them that you can appreciate the spirit in which they were created even while laughing at the silliness.

Finally, the slapstick elements of the movie were (with the exception of the nose jokes, for whatever reason, I just don't go for pure gross-out jokes) often laugh out loud, or at least snicker worthy. The magic carpet, the smoke bombs, the barroom brawl ending up the macho contestants laughing at objects they were impaled with, ""mini-me"" as a hard boiled NHL coach who is at one point of the movie fired into the goal thereby waking up the scoring booth lamp lighter who had fallen asleep during an interminable break in the action, a ""bollywood"" dance number at the end... Nice subtle and not-so-subtle touches throughout.

So what about the ""Love""? Did the Love Guru learn to love himself thereby freeing him to truly love others by the end of the movie? I found myself thankfully not caring about this, there was enough goodhearted intent to remove my usual skepticism regarding Myers' musings on relationships. Indeed, the overall goodnatured attitude of this movie was undoubtedly what attracted several major celebrities to participate. And if you're a fan of Stephen Colbert, you'll want to see his numerous scenes rambling on as a color commentator for the hockey TV broadcasts.

In the end I'm really not sure why so many of Mike Myers fans reacted with such disappointment to this movie: maybe the background props involving hockey and eastern religion for so many of the jokes were not as popular as those in previous efforts? Certainly more people could relate to music jokes and parodies of James Bond cinema.... So I'm thinking if you have an interest in hockey AND eastern religions AND are a Mike Myers fan, check this movie out and you might be pleasantly surprised.",1246147200,,3162,4.762773722627737

3113020,1,B0013J30YU,"The problem with this movie is that it's one of the least funny comedies ever created.  Ever.  Not only did I stop watching Love Guru half-way through the movie - something I have NEVER done before - but during that time, the unthinkable happened: I looked down upon Jessica Alba.  In all seriousness, Alba's next movie could be a 90-minute monstrosity with her kicking house-pets, burning down soup kitchens, and feeding toddlers to hyenas, and I'd still probably look favorably upon her performance.  So why is this so bad?

Well, it's not me.  Into-Me-I-See.  I laughed hard at Super Troopers, Old School, Superbad, and Talladega Nights, so I'm a big fan of juvenile humor.  I quote daily from the three Austin Powers movies, as well as Wayne's World, so it's not Mike Myers.  I compared the Feast series to the Godfather series, and Johnny Knoxville consistently makes me laugh, so it has nothing to do with vulgarity.  I love Jessica Alba and midgets, so it's not Jessica Alba or Verne Troyer.  I even enjoy B-movies, so it's not the fact that this is a B-movie.

As far as the ""plot"" goes, Guru Pitka (Myers) is an American self help guru who learned his skills in India from cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudha (Ben Kingsley) (ba-dum-cha!).  Pitka is hired by a Jane Bullard (Alba), to help her emotionally dysfunctional hockey team (ba-dum-cha!).  Full of idiotic catch phrases and acronyms, Pitka hopes to dethrone Deepak Chopra as one of the resident mumbo-jumbo experts on the Oprah Show (ba-dum-cha!).  Midget joke here (ba-dum-cha!), genitalia joke there (ba-dum-cha!).

Make no mistake; it looks big budget.  The cast, crew, and everyone involved: top notch.  There are even big name cameos like Val Kilmer.  The problem is it's just not funny.  Just look at the name of Kingsley's character again to see how bad the comedy is.

3113023,1,B0013J30YU,"People are always saying that things were better ""back then"" and the sentiment increases with age. When it comes to Hollywood movies, things were most certainly better when the movie business didn't release so many movies or beat successful horses until every last original thought or joke devolves into boring and fatuous formula. Welcome to the career of Mike Myers.

Maybe if the bulk of Myer's resume wasn't bullet-pointed with sequels and he hadn't showed us all the goodies in his comedy tool box; e.g., an entertaining mix of sophomoric innuendo, spot-on satire of genres, cheeky names, and the always-popular jokes regarding genitalia or bowel movements, he wouldn't have exhausted his repertoire and we wouldn't have to suffer through The Love Guru. This newest offering is as predictable as the jokes you see coming a mile away. Making it worse is that the premise isn't even that interesting. Like so many comedy movies released of late, there is a thread of a plot wrapped around ninety minutes of extremely tired jokes. The actors do their best and there are some smiles and mild chuckles, but most of it is just groan-inducing and expected.

I really like Mike Myers and want to believe that he has some great movies left in him, but to take several years to come up with this yawn-fest makes me question my beliefs. Either he has to let go of the reins and work for someone else or he needs to enter the cryogenic chamber and shoot himself into outer space in a giant Big Boy vessel, returning only when the last of us who have seen his work and grown tired of it are no longer living.",1237075200,6,1600,4.670212765957447

3113026,1,B0013J30YU,"""The Love Guru"" stars Mike Myers who gave us two successful films years ago, ""Austin Powers"" and ""Shrek."" Both films, witty and hugely entertaining, featured characters you can identify with, had lots of funny jokes and clever parodies of a certain film genre. Then in 2003 he made awful ""The Cat in the Hat."" We waited for five years since then and what we get is ""The Love Guru,"" another disappointing film from Mike Myers.

""The Love Guru"" has none of the style that made ""Austin Powers"" such a success. Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka, an American-born self help guru raised in India. Without letting us know how and why he was raised in India and became a guru, the film proceeds to tell us that Guru Pitka is hired by a hockey team owner played by Jessica Alba because her team's star player, she believes, really needs the help of the spiritual leader. But why a hockey player?

I know comedy is a subjective thing. Not everybody is going to laugh at the same thing. Don't get me wrong. I like silly jokes. I like sex jokes. But something is definitely wrong with the comedy when the actors start to look like desperate standup comic or clown waiting for laughs that will never come, trying to make us laugh with whatever gags he thinks of - cross-eyed Ben Kingsley's mentor, repetitious ""Mariska Hargitay"" mantra and of course, elephants.

Perhaps ""The Love Guru,"" Mike Myers's Razzie-winning comedy, does not deserve the award given to the year's worst film.

However, there are *way* too many penis jokes (yes, it is a humorous organ, but there are other things to laugh at).  Unsuccessful bits were repeated with the hope that they would improve with familiarity.

Strangely, this would have been better re-worked as a hockey movie.  The Guru is assigned to restore the self confidence and love life of a hockey star, and in the process finds himself.

Now what do these comedies have in common with this movie? well to be perfectly blunt, nothing! except they have a ""Desi"" or Indian humor melted into it!  i was surprised how Mike (chastity belt wearing neo-philosopher) Myers was able to pull off the accent and the movements, gestures so perfectly.  The guy really reinvented himself in this film.  I heard allot from people that this film is not cohesive, not related to anything and just makes people loose interest!  I totally understand that especially myself being a mixed bag of potatoes myself!

Sadly the audience to really get this film have to have had some affinity with the following forms of humor:

British / American / Indo-Asian /

This might sound a bit wacky but every ""hybrid"" (which i define having been brought up in all those 3 cultural settings) i have spoken to finds this movie a masterpiece!  Other folks just could not get the humor which is fine! Overall this film has made me laugh no matter how many time i have watched it! (15 by my count)",1228003200,2,2230,6.251633986928105

I wish I had not taken any notice of the negative reviews this movie received when it was in theaters and actually gone to see it.

Mike Myers plays the Love Guru, not a dissimilar role to those seen in Austin Power movies, however, the comedy is definitely strong throughout this whole movie.

The Guru is a kid who is taken in by a group that look Indian, but pretty much fictional who teach him that to find love, you must first find love in yourself...yadda yadda... anyway, he grows up and is hired by a woman to go back to Canada with him to help there star Ice Hockey player get himself together.

It doesn't sound like much of a plot to be helping him, himself and others to find a happy ending sort of thing, but it's a comedy, and the comedy works pretty well through out most of the movie. Some things you feel are a bit stale as you have seen Mike Myers do them before, but there is a lot of gags and jokes that just make you burst out laughing during the movie.

It won't win any prizes for greatest character or plot, or any best film awards, but who cares, it's just a feel good comedy with typical Mike Myers humor all through it.

something I found great was I hate Justin Timberlake, but during his scenes, I didn't even know it was him till I watched a bonus feature. So for the others who cant stand him, it's ok, you won't recognize the dork (to put that very lightly)

Ignore the reviewers who consider comedy has to be as dull as Friends or something, and just sit back and enjoy the movie not expecting to see comedy for the ages, but something entertaining you can laugh at through out it even if you do think you wouldn't wanna see it again for a while... just give it a go and don't listen to the 1/2 star reviewers who just have it in for Mike Myers no matter what he does.

3113049,3,B0013J30YU,"First of all let me begin by saying that if I were a fan of Comedies I would have given this a four, but comedies because of their lack of realism are not my forte.

That being said, after viewing the average that this movie has (on Amazon) I was afraid to watch. I watched it however, because the cast seemed stellar enough.

After having watched the film I can honestly say that it was ammusing. There were parts that were meant to be funny and didn't do the trick and the unrealism found in most comedies was rampant but it was done in a very silly manner and the writing was sharp- atleast the way dialoque was used in order to get a smile (sorry not big on comedies) out of people. The acting was also quite good and some of the characters are flatline enough to be believable.

However, I don't think that this film is appropriate for a 13 year old. It is rated PG13 but I wouldn't show it to anyone under 15 and I think it would actually be appropriate for 16+. Some of the jokes have a tad too much perversion and I think that it will take an older crowd to understand them and more importantly understand the gist of it which is to ammuse and possibly shock but not to represent anything in particular.

All in all I would say that it was an hour in a half well spent.

Also, after reading some of the reviews it seems that most people are not impressed by it because of what they expect from Mike Myers. I honestly, don't expect anything in particular from him as I don't, as already mentioned, really have an interest in comedy or comedians. All I can say is that I would spend the time and the couple of dollars to watch a movie like this again. I think it was good work.",1227052800,,1683,4.166153846153846

The team has a chance to win the Stanley Cup if its star can focus on hockey and not on the fact that his wife has left him for a rival player, nicknamed ""Le Coq."" I know it sounds like a recipe for a bad sports movie, but it isn't. The movie really has little to do with hockey at all. The focus is on Mike Myers's schtick and Justin Timberlake delivering comedy gold (as Le Coq).

The movie had a few hilarious scenes, but was just decent overall. I know it has not been well-reviewed by anyone, but I think most people's expectations were way too high. This is Mike Myers rehashing a few of the old bits that have brought him success in the Austin Powers franchise. His interaction with Vern Troyer (more affectionately known as Mini Me) is silly and for some people it is past its prime. I still enjoy it and I still enjoy Mike Myers so I still enjoyed The Love Guru.

Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) is the star player of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. Unfortunately Darren is having problems with his marriage and the stress has caused his game to fall off and the result has been a losing streak for the Maple Leafs. Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) the owner of the team is determined to get them back to their winning ways and prove to herself and the fans that the poor performances of the Maple Leafs is not her fault. To do this she enlist the help of Guru Maurice Pitka (Mike Myers) in hopes of reconciling the relationship between Darren and his wife Prudence who is now involved in a passionate relationship with Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake) who is a goalie for the Maple Leaf's Rival. Guru Pitka, motivated by the possibility that he may overtake Deepak Chopra as the number 1 Guru agrees to take the job and hilarity ensues...

I have been a fan of a lot of Mike Myers' work including ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Austin-Powers-International-Man-of-Mystery-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/6304696221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery (New Line Platinum Series)</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Austin-Powers-The-Spy-Who-Shagged-Me-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B00001U0BN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me (New Line Platinum Series)</a>"" but since those it seem like his efforts have been on the decline.

I was skeptical going in as I wasn't the least bit impressed with the trailer but since I felt Myers had the talent to write good movies and carry them with his acting that I would give it a shot. Unfortunately my initial impression was the correct one and the movie was very disappointing.

The Good: It is always nice to see Jesica Alba on screen even when her performance feels half hearted as it did in this. I had no problems with the look and sound of the movie. As much as I hate to admit it, Justin Timberlake gave a decent performance or as good of one as could be giver for his character.

The Bad: It is always bad when the comedy in a comedy falls flat and doesn't work as is the case in ""The Love Guru"". The vast majority of the humor just doesn't work and feels forced. Myers also need to stop creating work for Verne Troyer or at least pull it way back to minor roles as that bit has run it's course as far as getting laughs. The story overall is ludicrous which is typical of Myers' movies and would have been fine had the comedy been strong enough to carry the movie but since it fell flat you as a viewer are left to pick apart everything else.

Overall: ""The Love Guru"" just felt like Mike Myers was trying to cash in on the last bit of buzz his name has to offer. If you are looking for a laugh try picking up one of Judd Aptow's latest movies or if you need a Mike Myers fix pick up one of his older titles but skip this one.",1225238400,,3479,5.423290203327172

3113059,2,B0013J30YU,"The Love Guru, starring Mike Myers, is a bad, horrible film in so many ways. I'm writing my review in honor of the many Razzies that the film was recently nominated for.

Mike Myers has been a part of some great comedies over the last two decades from Waynes World, to Austin Powers to Shrek. Mike Myers can't be funny playing himself, or at least hasn't really tried to in film. He is great, however, at creating characters. At least until the Love Guru came along.

The Guru Pitka is a horrible character that is horribly played by Mike Myers. First, the Guru is a satire on Deepok Chopra I guess. Deepok Chopra is an extremely obscure pop culture reference to make an entire movie about. Second, as I watched the film, I could easily pick out the parts that were supposed to be funny or inspired, but the were instead painful and sad. Myers looks pathetic as the Guru Pitka, and it is even more saddening to watch the joy and zest with which he gave the character. Myers for some reason thought America would enjoy this character.

If you do decide to watch this movie, you will wonder what movie executive thought this film should be released in the summer. This movie is historically bad. The only good part about the movie is the supporting cast with Romany Malco, Verne Troyer, Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake and Ben Kingsley.

Avoid the temptation to watch this movie. It is not funny under any circumstances.",1224720000,,1418,4.570866141732283
3113060,2,B0013J30YU,"Star and co-writer Mike Myers is far too clever to be dismissed entirely for a film burdened by his kitchen-sink approach to comedy. However, this 2008 film comes closest to making him downright intolerable despite a smattering of smart one-liners that barely save it from landing in the junk bin.  The concept would seem ripe with possibilities as the film lampoons the commercial intentions of self-help gurus like Deepak Chopra, but Myers and his writing partner Graham Gordy appear more interested in bodily functions, gross-out humor, repetitive gags (""Mariska Hargitay""), Canadian in-jokes, and celebrity walk-ons rather than keep the satirical aspects focused enough to make a point. Unfortunately, first-time director Marco Schnabel simply lets the star and the rest of the lackluster cast flounder without lending a perspective that could have balanced the lowbrow shenanigans with the highbrow aspirations. As unsatisfying as the film is, I wonder if Judd Apatow could have saved this material.

The overextended plot revolves around self-help guru Maurice Pitka, who was born in America but raised in India. With his long hair and beard and traditional Hindu garb, Pitka is known as a second-rate Chopra, but he is aggressively looking for an opportunity to change that and get on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Enter Darren Roanoke, star player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who goes into a scoring slump just as the team makes the Stanley Cup playoffs. Team owner Jane Bullard and coach Punch Cherkov seek out Pitka to help Roanoke reconcile with his wife Prudence, who has caused his beleaguered lack of self-esteem. She has decided to leave him for the conjugal joys to be had with Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande, the goalie for the opposing Los Angeles Kings known for his elephantine endowment. Pitka espouses his radical ""DRAMA"" method of enlightenment to alleviate Roanoke's stress and lead him on a journey toward self-love. Apparently that's the only chance that the Maple Leafs have in winning the Cup. At the same time, Pitka realizes his goal to usurp Chopak is a hollow one when he becomes romantically drawn to the comely Bullard.

Myers may have gone to the well one too many times with his smarmy, overly self-aware performance as Pitka. What goodwill he generated as Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers has almost evaporated here. As Bullard, Jessica Alba is a pretty but unavoidably wooden foil to Myers, and her character's attraction to Pitka remains one of the film's bigger mysteries. Somewhat better is Romany Malco as Roanoke and Justin Timberlake as Grande, though neither is imposing enough to be particularly believable as professional hockey players. As a more verbal version of Mini-Me, Verne Troyer plays Cherkov in constant foul-mouthed agitation. The most embarrassing performance, however, belongs to a cross-eyed Ben Kingsley as Pitka's spiritual mentor, Guru Tugginmypudha. I doubt if any other Oscar winner has taken quite as discreet a fall from grace. On the other hand, I have to admit I liked the sitar revamp of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5"" as the irrelevant opening theme, as well as Stephen Colbert's funny bits with Jim Gaffigan as the play-by-play commentators. But that's about it.

The extras are abundant on the 2008 DVD if you care to view them. First, there is a standard making-of featurette, ""Mike Myers and The Love Guru - An Inside Look"" that runs ten minutes with comments from Myers, Alba, Troyer, and Schnabel. There is a six-minute short, ""One Helluva Elephant"", showing how special effects specialist Ron Stefaniuk built an animatronic elephant and ostrich for the movie. More interesting is ""Hockey Training for Actors"" which has sports coordinator Mark Ellis explaining how the actors learned to play hockey. Rounding out the extras are eleven deleted/extended scenes, a four-minute blooper reel, a separate five-minute compilation of deleted takes with Colbert and Gaffigan (the best of the extras and even better than the movie), ten minutes more of general outtakes, and the original theatrical trailer.",1224633600,2,4056,5.178353658536586

But I sat through each of those stinkers, right through to the end titles.  This one didn't even earn that level of interest and respect.  By forty minutes, I had had enough of the idiotic humor, the flat jokes, the bad characters, Myers wallowing in his own grossly overinflated sense of comedic creativity and personal hip-itude, and I had no interest at all in seeing how it would all turn out.

Myers plays a wacky Indian guru, a holy man specializing in love and relationships, but he has neither love nor a relationship of his own, and a clanking elephant-head chastity belt to boot.  The guru comes across as self-centered, money-grubbing, commercially prostituted, demented, capricious, manipulative and foul.  There is no serenity, no grace, not the slightest indication of any kind of scholarly depth, just a rapid-fire stream of idiotic caca-doody and genital jokes.  It's all urine and feces, phallic goofs, simulated pain inflicted on male sexual parts, the kind of stuff I found trite once I matured into 7th grade.  Now, I love the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackass/dp/B000BDH69O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackass</a>&nbsp;movies, so I know from funny in slapstick agony, genitals and excretory humor.  But this film was just mindless, moronic junk, a collection of Myers' jokes and stupid puns, the stuff that didn't make the cut for the second Austin Powers sequel, run together with a contrived, meandering, patchwork, pathetically predictable story.

If you've seen the film, you'll know that Myers' Guru Pitka would say that this film is pure Comprehensive Radical Adjustment Participation.

I mean, in the scene in which Myer's guru and his destined love have their first big date, he has arranged a very special meal which looks exactly like human testicles.  Both he and Jessica Alba bray their way through the endless stupid jokes, it all ending with the hilariously beaten and mutilated edible having to be discarded.  We've already been beaten over the head that the guru wants Alba as THE love of his incongruously empty life, and so this is the way he, The Love Guru, the man who has so much depth and experience in love and relationships, creates his first impression for his one-and-only?  Absolute garbage.

Myers' Indian guru character offended even me, and I'm about as white-bread as they come.  His bad Indian accent drifted in between the Saturday Night Live/""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" Scottish Dad, Fat Bastard and Shrek.  I mean, he couldn't even take the time to get his Indian accent down, so busy was he working on these complex, meaningful, mutually reinforcing gags about elephant dung and fighting with mops dripping with the fresh urine of his deeply honored guru-master.

Vern Troyer is reduced to spewing profanities, being the butt of increasingly vicious little-person jokes and a series of demeaning, ugly sight gags in which he is always the victim of physical violence.

Ben Kingsley--the guy who played freeking Gandhi, and won the Oscar for it--is reduced to playing a cross-eyed clown.  Sad.

Jessica Alba is stunning, predictably, but still just can't act, even in this shallow story.

And then there was the endless parade of celebs who want to be in a Mike Myers film, from Val Kilmer to Oprah, bad and forced cameos all, the kind of overblown star-packing formula that made me puke in ""Goldmember.""

The only good part I encountered lasted all of 20 seconds, a wonderfully done, detailed spin on the typical Bollywood boy-girl musical number, with Myers and Alba.  It was great, right down to the disorienting camera zooms, the impossible physical backdrops, the music and lyrics, the nauseatingly deep, warbling color and a jittery box with understated yet funny subtitles.

In his quest to become the next Deepak Chopra, Guru Pitka (Myers) learns the valuable lesson that patience and doing things right the first time is best for all persons, including himself.

Clearly, not everyone is going to be entertained by this movie, but I bet a good percentage of you out there would think it's a so-so movie, just as I thought.  It had highly entertaining moments.

Mike is actually pretty funny. Sure the jokes are old, but they're still pretty funny. Justin Timberlake is really hilarious in this. I loved his French Canadian accent and he was so funny.

I felt Jessica Alba was a bit flat. I kept waiting for her character to do something, but she never really did until the very end. I wish they had used Meagan Good more in this film. I think she's a really good actress and I felt like many of the times when she was silent she could have said something to inhance the film.

3113068,2,B0013J30YU,"Poor Mike Myers. The guy has a talent for creating clueless catchy characters that all basically run on a fuel of catch-phrases, sight-gags, and pokes at then current points of pop-culture. And usually it works. Works well. From teenage Metal fans Wayne's World, to a stranger in a strange land Austin Powers, when it comes to original creations, Mike Myers really has done well for himself. But how far can you use the exact same template, just changing it's color each time before the format grows stale?

Six years seems about right.

Because it's been six years since the last Austin Powers film Goldmember, and now Myers is back with a brand new character Guru Pitka, a self-help spiritual advisor who's second only to real-life equivalent Deepak Chopra. When Pitka gets an offer to help the Tiger Woods of Hockey Darren Roanoke (the Chris Rock-lite Romany Malco) get out of his romantic funk after losing the love of his life, he himself finds the same in the team's owner, played curiously by Jessica Alba, who I figure she thought she was originally appearing in Austin Powers IV. Along the way, you get a variety of secondary cast members by the likes of Justin Timberlake (who steals the show as a Canadian well-endowed goalie who stole Roanoke's love), Stephen Colbert (doing his Report as if it was Sportscenter), Ben Kingsley (who has offically flushed his credibly down the toliet here as Pitka's crossed-eyed mentor), and ""please give me a job"" Verne Troyer.

But what is painfully obvious literally minutes into this film is that all it really is, is a reworking of those Austin Powers movies. Instead of big glasses & funky teeth, it's a beard and big nose. Instead of an exaggerated British accent, it's an over-the-top Indian one. He even stoops to a few musical parodies in this too, sound painfully familiar? And when Powers had tons of humorous innunendo borderline-risque sight-gags, Guru follows suit, but feeling extremely forced and stale this time around. There are tons of word-play style jokes here that just scream ""Yeah, Baby!"" that will have your eyes rolling back into your head faster than you can say Linda Blair. And 80% of them you will see coming. This was just too expected of Myers to do after patenting that style of humor he's known for from way back in his SNL days. Granted, about 3/4 into the film the character might grow on you a little more, but even with a second viewing you'll still think half these jokes would have worked better out of the mouth of say Dr. Evil.

The disc isn't too bad for extras with a documentary, outakes, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel (which looks like nobody on-set was really laughing all that hard to begin with), but this film won't sit next to Wayne's World or Austin Powers on your shelf without hiding behind it's fakey beard. Too much like a rehash of former greatness to be considered good on it's own, Mike Myers needs to find himself a writer that can present him in a whole new light without the crutch of body-part jokes and funny plastic faces to only carry him through.

On the other hand, there is another valid line of thought that would argue anyone who would watch a Mike Myers film is incapable of rational, conscious thought. A point well taken I must admit. With that said, if you're still reading this review we know what camp you fall into.

In the '08 film `The Love Guru' Mr. Myers plays Guru Pitka, the second most popular spiritual teacher in the Occidental world, second to Deepak Chopra of course. Guru Pitka finally gets the opportunity to possibly move out of the number two position when he's hired by the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team (Jessica Alba) to restore the broken marital relationship between their star player and his estranged wife who has moved in with the Los Angeles Kings well endowed goalie (Justin Timberlake).  If he's successful he will not only be handed a two million dollar check but has been promised a booking to appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show! As you should have already guessed his spiritual instructional methods are, shall we say suspect and the storyline loaded with the usual gag routines, inside jokes and shots at anyone and everyone. In other words typical Mike Myers faire.

Oh! I also enjoyed comedian Daniel Tosh in his minute-long role as 'cowboy hat' I think that in a film so, so terrible he was a shining star. Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan were also nice as the hockey announcers.

Other then that, the Guru Pitka(Mike Myers) is an unfunny and annoying Guru from India(with Catch phrases and everything!) who's trying to triumph over his rival Deepak Chopra and go on the Oprah show. And of course, the only way this is all possible is for Pitka to succeed in reuniting hockey player Darren Roanoke(Romany Malco)and his wife Prudence(Meagan Good).

3113076,2,B0013J30YU,"Ah The Love Guru.  You know, I think Mike Myers is a funny guy, and given the fact that I'm a huge hockey fan, I should really be into this movie...

... right?

Anywho, let's take a quick look at the film.  The plot:  Guru Pitka (Myers), while on a quest to become the next Deepak Chopra, is hired by Toronto Maple Leafs GM Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) to help Leafs star Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) win his estranged wife (Meagan Goode) back from Los Angeles Kings goaltender/crazy Celine Dion fan Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake), who's known for his large... you get the picture.  In helping out Roanoke, Pitka must put away his fears towards relationships himself, as well as determine whether fame or fortune are as important as living up to the standards he preaches.  Will he sell out or will he do the right thing?

(I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it shouldn't take a rocket scientist to answer that question because there are no surprises in this film.)

So how did it do?  The movie was as asinine as suggesting that the Kings or Leafs will be Cup contenders in the near future.  Unlike the Austin Powers movies, it's becoming harder to pretend that all of Mike Myers' characters are anyone else other than, well, Mike Myers.  The weak and redundant plot attempts to use a barrage of toilet jokes to keep it afloat, but largely fails after 20 minutes or so.  Had the style of humor been used less frequently, it would have elicited a better response.  Yet the use of the constant gags to keep the story line afloat should have given way to the notion that the move was less of an artistic endeavor and more of a vehicle for Myers to showcase his love of hockey and his celebrity buddies.

However, there were a few things that saved this movie.  For starters, despite limited screen time, Timberlake was oddly funny as his French-Canadian counterpart.  Further, Stephen Colbert was hilarious as the HNIC announcer and had great chemistry with the other co-announcer Jim Gaffigan.  Finally, in an oddly prophetic move, the two teams that L.A. and Toronto are shown having their way with en route to the Stanley Cup Finals were Detroit and Pittsburgh, who actually contended for the Cup.

All and all though, if you're able to rent this for a buck or for free at your local library, you may find enough humor to get your money's worth.  Otherwise, it was too unmemorable to be recommended.",1222041600,,2409,4.597189695550352

But, it is not as bad as everyone out there is apt to point out.

Agreed - the humor is mostly bad, it's full of genitalia jokes, and some really ""bad taste"" sequences (look out for the mop-fight!), but I wouldn't just trash the movie as yet.

Myers plays an Indian Love Guru (anyone said ""Peter Sellers in The Party""?) named Guru Pitka, taught by a squint-eyed Ben Kingsley (why? and more importantly, how?) to spread the message of peace and love to the world, but bound by a vow (read ""chastity belt""), until such time as he begins to love himself, above all else.

This last part didn't make sense (yes! even more than the other stuff!) to me. But then, we'll come back to this a little later.

He has nightmares about being the second-best Guru in the business, always behind the eponymous Deepak Chopra. To become numero uno, he must prove he is good enough by re-uniting an estranged hockey player with his wife, which would win him an invitation from Oprah, which, in turn, would make him No. 1.

The plot is not funny, and largely, neither is the cast. But I have to admit I couldn't keep from laughing my a** off on more than one ocassion. Myers' speciality is to shock you and force you to break into a laughter, a stunt which the Guru Pitka also pulls many times during the movie, and succeeds quite often in.

The sillyness index is quite high, but if you have time on your hand and have a chance to see this flick, you might actually give it a second thought.

Cameo appearances by Jessica Simpson, Val Kilmer, Mariska Hargitay (Det. Olivia Benson on Law & Order: SVU), and Deepak Chopra fill the gaps in the movie.

Uh, and yes, about that remark ""love yourself, above all else"" makes sense when Chopra meets Guru P. and says ""You are free"", to which the GP replies, ""I'm no longer the next Deepak Chopra, I'm the first Guru Pitka"".

Peppered by such quips intermittently, and a laugh here-and-there, the movie was enough to make me watch it full and not discard it simply because so many people did.

3113097,3,B0013J30YU,"From the moment I first heard Mike Meyer's new film ""The Love Guru"" and Steve Carell's new film ""Get Smart"" would be released on the same day, I was surprised. Common practice in Hollywood dictates you don't release two such similar films on the same day. At best, you are going to split the audience, and both films could suffer. This seems to have been born out by the box office, with ""The Love Guru"" suffering.

Because both films were released on the same day, I decided to see both, back to back. And I am going to write about both, back to back.

The Love Guru ***
Get Smart *

I really get the sense Mike Meyer's is trying to channel the spirit of Peter Sellers. Consciously or not, he has created two characters with more than a few similarities to some of Sellers' most famous creations. Austin Powers has more than a few things in common with Inspector Clouseau and now the Guru Pitka has more than a few things in common with Harundai V. Bakshi, Sellers character in the less well-known Blake Edward's film ""The Party"". Meyers is a talented guy, a funny guy, who seems to obsess over every detail in his films. Sellers was, reportedly, the same way. While Sellers' characters will continue to endure the test of time, we don't know if the more modern Meyer's work will have the same outcome. It's too early to tell.

Meyer's ""The Love Guru"" is a silly film. From the moment I first saw the trailer, I laughed, a lot. Filled with silly, ""Austin Powers""-esque comedy, there were a lot of jokes packed in that trailer and the movie delivers more of the same.

The movie is very silly and packed with jokes, many of which work and many of which don't. The jokes fly fast and furious, and Meyers certainly tries very hard to get the audience to laugh. I half expected someone to throw a cream pie at Meyers. But there is also the smack of familiarity to many of the jokes. They could easily have been trans planted into ""Austin Powers 4"" and provided the same laughs. It also seems odd that Verne Troyer is also in the new film, playing a different character, but his presence makes the comparisons to Austin Powers all the more prevalent. And many of the jokes concerning his character revolve around the same humor Mini-Me elicited in the Powers films.

If anything is to be learned from Meyer's comedy, he loves midgets and fart jokes, both providing equal opportunity for laughs.

Meyers has done a lot of interviews and in many he has mentioned the profound impact the death of his father had on his life. This led him to meet Depak Chopra, the very famous guru and self-help coach who has apparently provided Meyers with a lot of guidance. ""The Love Guru"" tells the story of Guru Pitka, the Number Two guru in the United States, behind Deepak Chopra. Pitka desperately wants to become Number One and the Toronto Maple Leafs provide him with an opportunity, their star goalie Darren Roanoake (Romany Malco, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") has broken up with his wife Prudence (Meagan Good) and is not playing well. With the Stanley Cup around the corner, the team's owner, Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba), hires Pitka to bring Roanoke and Prudence back together. Naturally, there are complications. Pitka finds himself attracted to Jane and Prudence is dating the star goalie for the Los Angeles Kings, a Celine Dion-loving Canadian, Jacques ""The Cock"" Grande (Justin Timberlake).

Meyers lets the jokes fly fast and furious; from the opening frames when we hear narration by Morgan Freeman, to the Guru Pitka's constant use of bad trademarked sayings, the film has a lot of laughs. But Meyers is also dependent on scatological humor and there are a lot of jokes involving farts, bowel movements, accidents and more, jokes too silly for even this film.

""The Love Guru"" suffers from a number of small problems. The first is the humor throughout the film is so juvenile; it is extremely hit and miss. Everyone can only take so many fart jokes or jokes about 'messing your pants'. The other thing I found odd about the film is that at a couple of key moments, they don't go far enough with the ideas. Early on, Pitka remembers a key moment in his life and we watch it much like a Bollywood film, complete with scratches and film burn. This is a great idea and only reinforces the wackiness of the story and the idea, but it only lasts a few moments. At the end of the film, Pitka claims ""I want to dance"" and a Bollywood musical number begins in a small seaside village. Jessica Alba dances out, his assistant becomes a part of the entourage, even Verne Troyer takes part. This is a moment, much like the end of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", when you would expect all of the characters to join in and start dancing in a highly synchronized way to an American rock song, in this case ""The Rocker"". But the dance number only involves the few characters mentioned and only lasts a few seconds. It seems like they ran out of money and simply had to get what they could.

Also, I have seen a number of films recently in which well-known comedians play Sports Commentators (most of these star Will Farell as he seems to have the lock on this franchise, ""Semi-Pro"", ""Blades of Glory""). In ""The Love Guru"", Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan play hockey commentators and they suffer from the same fate as the others; they simply aren't funny. Each of these characters is decidedly ""wacky"", and says ""off-color"" things, and tries to act like they are weird and funny. But in each of these films, the characters look like they are trying to act weird and funny and this does little than to slow down the rest of the story.

It is amusing that Meyers is making fun of something so ripe for parody. But he also takes aim at the very type of thing Chopra has risen above, making his character a more desperate version of someone like Chopra. It works, but not all the time.",1215388800,4,5854,4.539336492890995
3113098,4,B0013J30YU,"I'm usually quite tepid toward comedy films of any kind.  I like smart comedy, stuff that makes me laugh at more than seeing two elephants, um, copulating.

In recent years I've read all sorts of reviews that try to find more depth in a movie than it, on the surface, even proclaims to offer.

The Love Guru, for as silly as it is, had me laughing through about 90%.  Admittedly I'm biased toward all things Indian (and this didn't quite stand up to 2003 The Guru), but it showed the writer's paid due attention to the things they were parodying.  Plus, the issues they addressed (infidelity, self-help, work stress, etc.) are ones that can speak to a wide swath of people.  Sometimes reaching the widest target audience with politically driven comedies misses the mark (in my mind I refer to You Don't Mess With the Zohan).

Sure this movie has had a luke-warm response by many (the trusted Week magazine shamefully gave it a one-star..blech), but I think anyone who watches this film and expects any more than a good time with some fun Mike Myers past references, is bound to be disappointed.

Heck, I had to watch Dumb and Dumber 6 times before it made me laugh.  It's all about letting your mind open up.

As for The Love Guru cast, all had their high points:

Mike Meyers: Funny and goofy as ever.  I laughed most when he got the bathroom scribbling joke and when he sang More Than Words...the latter due primarily to his get-up.

Justin Timberlake: Why do people scoff so? I don't know much about the Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, but I imagine that Timberlake portrayed a fine parody of one.

Jessica Alba: Her character fit the least well, but she stood on her own.  A good sport for doing things Bollywood style.

Ben Kingsley: from Gandhi to Guru Tugginmypudha, what more shall I say?

Verne Troyer:  Not that this man wasn't funny before, but I really liked his bad-a** attitude as the Coach.

Overall, the names were silly (if you don't catch their meaning phonetically, then read them some where), the jokes were constant, the meaning was superficial, but it was all around a very good time.",1214784000,5,2099,4.639566395663957
3346809,3,B0013J30YU,"Forget about Mike Myers for a minute. Let's begin with Ben Kingsley, the Oscar winning actor who actually appears in ""The Love Guru""; he plays a cross-eyed spiritual advisor from India, and his name is not a double entendre so much as it's a blatant sexual reference smushed into a single word. The sight of this man is hilarious, and yet I didn't want to laugh because I know that Kingsley has made so many better choices than this film. What possessed him to act in a film this unashamedly juvenile? Did he find the idea of nonstop [...] gags appealing? I might as well be asking myself the same questions, because in all honesty, ""The Love Guru"" often had me giggling like a six-year-old who heard his first dirty joke. But to call this movie a comedic masterpiece would be an insult to the very concept of comedy.

The plot focuses on Pitka (Myers), an American-born, Indian-raised guru who was taught by Kingsley's character to become an expert in matters of love. How, I'm not entirely sure; he was forced to put on a metal chastity belt at the age of twelve, and there it would stay until he learned how to love himself above all others. Be that as it may, he's now a world-renowned spiritual advisor, guiding hundreds of followers with his bits of wisdom. He even attracts celebrities like Mariska Hargitay, and that's really interesting because her name doubles as his blessing for peace, love, and tranquility. But for all his fame and fortune, Pitka feels empty inside because he's only the second most famous guru. The first, of course, is Deepak Chopra. There is, however, a way for Pitka to increase his popularity: he must heal a troubled relationship between a Hockey player and his wife, who left him for another Hockey player. If Pitka can help them, he will be secured a guest spot on Oprah's show.

This opportunity arises because of Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba), owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs; the team's star player, Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), broke up with his wife, Prudence (Meagan Good), and as a result, his Hockey skills have been waning. This shouldn't be a problem for Pitka, who's always ready with a slew of sayings hidden within acronyms. Examples: GURU is short for Gee, You Are You, and BIBLE is short for Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. He also has published a number of self-help books with such inspiring titles as ""If You're Happy and You Know It, Think Again,"" and ""Does it Hurt When You Do That? Don't Do That."" He introduces himself to Darren by rolling in on a motorized pillow and telling him that his wife has forgiven him. Low and behold, Darren's practice shots improve dramatically; Pitka then understands that the key to Darren's success is about distraction, not merely about reconciling a feuding couple.

Thus begins a strict regiment of spiritual guidance. Darren's first big obstacle is his wife's new boyfriend, a French-Canadian Hockey player named Jacque Grande (Justin Timberlake). His talent is huge, much like his ... well, let's just say that there's a reason this man is so fond of roosters. Darren's second obstacle is his mother (Telma Hopkins), whose loveable face hides an incredibly overbearing personality. If Pitka can convince him to face her, he might be able to overcome years of emotional scarring. This, in turn, will bring him one step closer to patching things up with Prudence.

Intertwined with all of this is the relationship between Pitka and Jane, which steadily grows. Jane feels inadequate because of what she calls the Bullard Curse; the long and short of it is that everyone in the city blames her for the Maple Leafs' losing streak. As a result, men stay as far away from her as possible. I have a feeling the audience won't care about this subplot one bit--all anyone will notice are the film's back-to-back sexual innuendoes related to male genitalia. There are also a fair number of gags featuring the Maple Leafs' coach, an angry, foulmouthed dwarf played by Verne Troyer. You remember Verne Troyer as Mini Me from the ""Austin Powers"" sequels, don't you? The dwarf jokes in those films wore thin after a while. The same can be said in the case of ""The Love Guru."" Truth be told, every joke wears thin at a certain point.

But I can't deny the fact that I laughed every now and then. Consider cameo appearances by Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan as sports announcers--they add nothing meaningful to the story, yet their one-liners are so outlandish that I found myself smiling. I'm not exactly proud of myself for that. I know that there are much better comedies out there, ones that don't begin and end with musical numbers and feature two elephants having sex in a Hockey rink. Again, I turn my attention back to Ben Kingsley, who chose to play a cross-eyed Indian despite his accomplished career: Did that same guilty laughter haunt him as he read the script? Was he actually tempted by the idea of telling masturbation jokes to audiences of immature teenagers? Maybe so, because goodness knows I wasn't strong enough to completely resist it. There's absolutely no good reason to see ""The Love Guru,"" even if you think you will find it funny.",1213920000,11,5150,4.762597984322508
3346810,3,B0013J30YU,"After viewing this film...I was left wondering where the funny Mike Myers was.  The film is about a guru who is a guide to a young hockey player's love life, but has never been in love himself.  It is the job of the guru to help the hockey player (played by  Malco) with his love life as well as his professional life.  I found the humor to be recycled jokes and puns that could have been better presented.  The humor from the Guru (books with long titles, telling people intimacy means 'into me I see', and making jokes about jacking off to an elephant) just didn't cut it for me.  I spent over an hour waiting to crack a smile.
 The same goes for Vern Troy's parts.  I suppose I was expecting the duo to do the same magic they did in Austin Powers.  He played the Maple Leafs manager and had a micro office that four other characters tried to squeeze into.  That scene was funny. Troyer's part had a number of short jokes (him being offered shrimp during dinner, and being called a gnome when 'name' was meant)and stunts, but again, not much to laugh about.

Jessica Alba played the owner of the T.O Maple Leafs and towards the end her indian dance moves reminded me of what I saw in 'The Guru'. It was lovely and colorful choreograpy. Not much can be said about her character; a nice woman who's team was cursed until the guru came along.

Justin Timberlake played a not-so-funny french hockey player who was known as Le coq (for his large penis).  I understood some of the french humor and curse words used, but again was not impressed. Particularly with the fight scene between he and the guru.

As for Romany Malco it was great to see him in a more interesting role where he's not swearing constantly.  I remember him from 'The Chateau' and never thought I'd see him again.  He played a broken-hearted hockey player who was afraid to contront his mother (played by Thelma Hopkins).

Years later Guru Pitka is found to be in competition with Deepak, and devises a plan to becoming a guest on the Oprah Winfrey; which he believes will lead him to national stardom.

Not so bad it's hilarious like ""The Room,"" not so bad it's bound to be a legend in awfulness like ""Manos: The Hands of Fate.""  More like ""so bad I think I lost brain cells watching this thing.""  And the worst part?  I watched this movie on the recommendation of MY MOTHER, who said that was raunchy but hilarious and that despite the off-color humor there were some genuinely sweet moments and good lessons on maintaining relationships.  Note to self, just because your mother likes a movie doesn't mean it's quality...

""The Love Guru"" follows a guru named Pitka (played by Mike Meyers), who has millions of followers and lives a wealthy life from his relationship-based self-help programs... but who dreams of gaining a spot on Oprah's show and bears a deep grudge against Deepak Chopra for being the ""#1 Guru in the world.""  When Jane, the owner of a Canadian hockey team (Jessica Alba) recruits Pitka's aid in solving the marital woes of her star hockey player so he can help them win the Stanley Cup, he sees his chance to win Jane's heart and the spot of #1 guru, and leaps right in.  But his battle to win Jane's heart and break the player out of his funk will pit him against a well-endowed rival player (Justin Timberlake), his client's overbearing mother, and his own insecurities... and result in supposedly-funny hijinks.

Yes, I say supposedly funny -- this film is very deeply NOT funny.  Almost every gag relies on a tired pop-culture reference that dates incredibly quickly, racist/sexist jokes, or  sexual or toilet humor.  I'm no prude who demands all humor be squeaky clean, but at the same time sex, urine, farts, and other such subjects are not funny on their own -- they have to be used cleverly.  There is nothing funny about an Indian guru making his students fight with urine-soaked mops, elephants having sex in front of a captive audience, or a character whose entire personality revolves around his... ahem, physical endowments.  Also, this film is so incredibly racist when it comes to Indian and Hindu culture that I'm surprised there wasn't more of an outcry from the Indian community.  When a movie's only genuinely funny moment comes from a blooper included in the end credits, something has gone terribly wrong.

I'm not a huge fan of Mike Myers, but I harbored no special hatred for him either.  But boy, this film came close to making me loathe the man and everything he's involved in.  While he's genuinely funny in ""Wayne's World"" and the ""Shrek"" films (I haven't seen ""Austin Powers""), here he's given carte blanche with the story and jokes... and it's not a pretty sight.  Someone really needed to reel in his cruder and dumber jokes, and tell him that just throwing in an endless stream of vulgar humor and celebrity cameos isn't going to make a film work.  And speaking of cameos... it's highly embarrassing watching genuinely decent actors and personalities like Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Val Kilmer, Stephen Colbert, and Deepak Chopra make fools of themselves in this movie.  Did they really need the money that bad or did Myers have some kind of dirt on their pasts to blackmail them with...

To sum up -- this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I find I can't really recommend it to anyone.  Not to Myers fans (watch ""Wayne's World"" instead), not fans of bad films (watch ""The Room"" or ""Southland Tales"" instead), and certainly not to anyone's mother (thank heavens my own mom has since reversed her opinion on this movie and now despises it).

3346858,2,B0013J30YU,"Mike Myers (""Austin Powers,"" ""Wayne's World"") stars in this satire of New Age self-help. He's an Indian guru Pitka who's a star for his cheesy acronym-laden advice, but wants to get to the next level. He sees his chance when the owner of a hockey team (Jessica Biel) wants him to help one of her star players who's devastated about his girl leaving him. Myers has to get the player back together to get his girl so the player will start hitting pucks again.

This was Mike Myers' attempt to start a new franchise and re-launch his career. It may just have killed his career instead. This movie was just so horribly misguided. It was everything terrible about Austin Powers and none of the things we liked.

I think this movie started with Myers going through his bag of accents to see which ones he could build a character out of: ""My British accent worked last time. I do a good Indian accent, let's do that."" But the idea of a white man playing an Indian guru is just such a bad idea that it should have killed the movie. Then they doubled-down by deciding to put a prosthetic hooked nose on Myers to make him look ""Indian,"" even though Pitka is supposed to be a white man adopted in India. When the movie opens with Pitka playing ""9 to 5"" on a sitar while riding around on elephants and fringed pillows, the racism crosses from kind of funny to flat-out offensive.

Besides the racism, the movie tries so hard to offend people, which I don't like. It's one thing to do edgy humor, but another to do humor just for the sake of being offensive. ""Love Guru"" has probably the most jokes about male anatomy of any comedy I've seen. For example, Justin Timberlake plays Jacque LeCoque, a well-endowed rival who is one of the few bright spots of the movie, even if his role is just a bunch of penis jokes. At a certain point, I felt like ""okay, we get it. Find another source of humor.""

I also felt like Myers only added the role of the coach (Verne Troyer) so he could make fun of him, since the coach's role existed almost entirely on short jokes.

All of the above could have been okay if the movie itself was funny, and it's just not. The tone is all over the place with jokes thrown at the screen every few seconds and very few of them are actually good. I did think a couple jokes were good, but they weren't worth grinding through the unfunny parts.

On the whole, ""Love Guru"" was a terrible movie with a terrible idea and a terrible story that wasn't very funny. I really hope Myers gets to make another movie, because he's a really funny guy. Maybe he'll do a better job next time.",1490832000,,2587,4.345755693581781

3346880,1,B0013J30YU,"This is one of those movies you really only need to see once. I originally saw it in the theaters, and while it has a ton of famous cameos, none of them play a part in the plot. It was an excuse to get people to the theaters. The plot is ridiculous. Mike Myers should not have been allowed to write his own jokes for this movie. They feel stale, boring, confusing, and just plain bad. The songs are silly and stupid at the same time, making you hate yourself a little each time you make a slight chuckle at them. It could have been an amazing movie, if they didn't give Myers carte blanche with the jokes and plot. There are definitely a few moments that were worth seeing but overall nearly everything in it was a bad choice. I actually really like Mike Myers and enjoy most of his other movies (Wayne's World 1 and 2, So I Married an Axe Murderer, all the Austin Powers) but this movie just can't stand on its' own two feet without putting its figurative head up it's butt (see attached actual screenshot from the movie). If you are a hardcore Mike Myers fan, you owe it to yourself to sit awkwardly for two hours through this film, so when someone else brings up how bad it was you can agree with them instead of defending Myers' arguably worst movie ever. 5 minutes in and I was already regretting watching this a second time in my life.",1486339200,7,1341,4.262745098039216

Movies generally have: a plot, characters that are distinguishable and/or relate-able, a lesson / moral / solved mystery or case - basically the viewer learns something by the end, and should also be compelling enough to hold you to the end. None of these things existed in The Love Guru. There is no plot - just a jumbled series of events that happens in no particular order. The characters are one dimensional, and Mike Myer's character is crude and obnoxious, only capable of using offensive / disgusting middle-school humor. The only reason  I sat through the whole thing was because I was shocked at how this movie was the OPPOSITE of a movie in every way, and I couldn't believe that this was something that actually made it to the big screen, let alone past the idea-phase of planning.

The story feels like a pretext to let Myers try his hand at creating another lovable funny weird character, but it comes across as ethnically tone deaf and even insulting in some instances. If the film was a laugh riot this could be overlooked (perhaps), but since it isn't, it is baffling anyone would think this was something a wide audience would want to see. The biggest mystery by far is why an actor of the stature and intelligence of Ben Kingsley would be in this film, in a role that is humiliating, unfunny, and racist. I liked Austin Powers, and although the comedy in The Love Guru is of the same style, it fails miserably for the reasons mentioned. It is such a bad film it is actually interesting to watch to see how consistently wrong/stupid/racist/idiotic it got as it went on.",1485475200,,862,4.532051282051282

The jokes and word plays got more and more obvious and less and less funny as the movie went on.  I like the people in it, but there was nothing there to offset the childish potty humor and make it worth seeing it through.  It crossed the threshold from funny to cheap pretty early on and didn't seem like it was going to get better.  We've got limited 'grown-up' viewing time and this wasn't worth it.  I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because a) I tend not to hate things, and that's the Amazon definition of 1 star, and b) there may have been some redemptive value if we'd gotten through the whole thing, but we only watched as much as we did because of the train wreck effect.",1484784000,,963,4.305555555555555

The plot was garbage.  The acting was garbage.  The comedy was garbage.  The characters were garbage.  The entire movie was garbage.  The one and only redeeming quality was the fact it was a AAA big-budget movie with high-quality video and sound.

This movie was so lazily thrown together that it had skits and bits that were exact copies of bits that cast members had done in other movies.

The endless dick jokes, cliched shallow characters, in short almost everything was pointless.

It seems anyone that hates this film only hates it because they either got offended, found it's comedy inappropriate or just flat out they don't like comedy movies to start with.

3347436,1,B0013J30YU,"Remember when Mike Myers was funny? Yeah, me neither. This movie has completely overridden any memories of comedic competence from Myers in my mind. Opening with a rousing version of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5"" on the sitar (please, no more: my ears are bleeding...,) the film promptly reveals its raison d'tre: jokes about reproductive organs and bodily functions that fifth grade boys would be embarrassed by. This movie is so truly unfunny, I don't know where to start.

While there are a couple of amusing bits skewering the whole pop-enlightenment culture (I have no idea how they actually got Deepak Chopra to be involved with this project,) e.g. presentations taking you ""from 'nowhere' to 'now-here,'"" the jokes are absolutely stultifying, but if it's scatological it's covered: I never again need to contemplate a urine mop battle, if that gives you some idea about what we're dealing with here.

There is talent aplenty on display, and an astonishing list of cameos far too lengthy for me to remember: Val Kilmer, Jessica Simpson, Kanye West, Jim Gaffigan and Stephen Colbert, just off the tip of my brain. Gaffigan and Colbert are color commentators and hockey broadcasters that get some of the funniest bits of the film (which isn't saying much,) while even Oprah (!) gets a moment of glory to bask in. Likewise there are big names in the cast: Ben Kingsley plays the perpetually cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudha (yes, that's the level of comedy being served) and Jessica Alba represents the Toronto Maple Leafs management. Oh didn't I mention this movie is all about hockey? Sadly it is, and it's enough to make hockey fans weep. Due to a love triangle of idiotic proportions, Alba needs Guru Pitka (Myers) to help Toronto win the Stanley Cup. Just think about that concept for a second. The best performances in the film (other than Colbert and Gaffigan, who have minor recurring parts,) are from the embattled hockey arch-enemies Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) and Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake) who face off on the ice and off. Suffice it to say that Timberlake carries what little of the film he can, and is leagues ahead of Myers in comedic execution here. On the positive side, there is one joke that did make me laugh: Grande's car, which you will have to see to fully appreciate.

There's a musical number in which Myers sings ""Surely you're a goddess of love who fills my heart with lugubrious recalcitrance."" At least they got lugubrious right, anyway. When the best scene in the film is a rooster attack superimposed over Celine Dion singing you know you're in for a rocky ride.

The film is a big budget flop that lost millions and was hated by critics of every stripe, but it's clear from the sets to the cinematography that no stone was left unturned to try to make a nice looking film here. If only the material hadn't been so utterly wretched.

I would actually rather watch ""Freddy Got Fingered"" again.

My husband said in order to really get the humor in a lot of the movie, you have to watch it more than once because you hear and see things you didn't focus in on before or just didn't understand exactly what he was implying. As you watch it again, and even yet again, you become more comfortable with the characters and then start to really understand more of the humor and references because it doesn't pass by so quickly. I don't like parts of comedies going by without knowing most of what they're referencing, so I googled a bunch of names, words, and references from the movie that I didn't quite understand... and I gotta tell ya, this movie was genius and hilarious!! I can even say that I LOVE it so much that it's right up there with Jim Carrey's best! After seeing this movie over and over again, I'm still interpreting different parts in different ways and I find it just as comical as before! My husband and I are walking around quoting many parts from the movie, all day long!!! I think the critics zonked out on this one and I won't trust their ratings because I think this movie should have been at least in the top box office hits. We are also big fans of his Austin Powers and Wayne's World... and even Shrek!!!

Perhaps we find it so funny because we are into Deepak Chopra, spiritual type stuff, and music, as well as Jim Carrey; so by mixing them all, We're in Heaven! :) Rented it once, bought it immediately afterwards, then watched it at least 15 times, and ready to watch it another 15 times!!!!",1372550400,,1623,4.370860927152318

The problem with The Love Guru is that it's not funny. You can tell easily when they are trying to put in the jokes, but you're just left scratching your head. A prime example is the guru rides into a room on an electrical magic carpet. Then somebody from the set (e.g. videographer) enters the picture, gets on it, and rides off. Not funny, just pointless.

Once I watched the behind the scenes, I appreciated the movie more, when I found out how athletic Timberlake is. Hockey fans will probably know the name Rob Blake, during one of the breaks in the action, started taking real shots on Timberlake. (Timberlake) who plays Jaques Grande the LA Kings goaltender, started to make some saves on the Rob Blake wrist and slapshots.

He's hired by the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs because they think the only way they can win the cup is if their star player gets back with his wife and they hope Guru Pitka can get them back together.

From Mike Myers, creator of Wayne's World and Austin Powers, I'd expect a solid comedy, but ""The Love Guru"" was obviously not written on one of his good days (Myers and cowriter Graham Gordy ""won"" a Razzie Award for worst screenplay). The story is weak but in comedies like this the characters and jokes are often more important than the story. Unfortnately, Guru Pitka is nowhere near as funny as Austin Powers for instance, and the jokes often fall flat, with some exceptions. Ben Kingsley's talents are wasted in an unfunny role as an older guru. 1+",1283731200,2,859,4.541935483870968

Nowhere in this movie is safe from provocative play-on-words, visual aids of the nether-regions, and simple double entendres; I'm a veteran at knowing double entendres, so no word of promiscuous implication, regardless of how subdued, ever flew over my aggravated head.  That's pretty much his schtick, because...what else does he have?  He's an aged hound relying on the same old tricks: speaking to the audience and winking from ""Wayne's World"", silly acronyms that spell out a vulgar word from ""Cat In The Hat"", midget jokes from ""Austin Powers"", men gettin' their testies smashed also from ""Austin Powers"", and sing-a-longs from popular hits...""Austin Powers"" as well; in fact, this movie is a step-backward regarding sing-a-longs since Myers only mockingly sang by lyrics instead of adding his own words.  ""Austin Powers"" also did the whole 'love' puns, but the movie was never funny for that; it was funny for Dr. Evil's crazy antics.  Reattempting familiar gags for this movie doesn't make them funny, they're just old.

It's just as unfortunate, since the main character, Guru Pitka, has to carry the humor for the whole movie.  He's the exact opposite of a spiritual adviser, being a narcissistic and materialistic fool.  Despicable in obvious ways, and his childish teachings for so-called 'wisdom' is actually creepy, almost as creepy as the scenes where Myers's head in digitally-inserted in a child's body.  The side characters are a letdown; I didn't expect much from Jessica Alba who's role is metaphorically spreading her legs for the entire movie or Justin Timberlake existing for a schlong joke and a phony accent, but I'm disappointed in Romany Malco.  Malco has been a funny guy in ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and the first few seasons of ""Weeds"", but he has no stellar material for his role.  His Canadian 'Tiger Woods of Hockey' character is a straight-forward object for Pitka to interact for screen-hogging gags.

Well, and you have! Myers has played very similar wacky, crazy, strange, crude, characters for sure. Some have complained of these similarities and wrote bad reviews semi-based on this fact.
For being a ""Love Guru"" whom is out to make the world a better place, he is very perverted and crude at times... well, most of the time! He is mega-rude to the coach of the Maple Leafs, played by Verne Troyer. The chemistry between the two is piss-your-pants funny as the coach tries to even the score with the Guru he literally cannot stand the sight of, which you can't blame him for!
The announcers at the hockey arena, Justin Timberlake's character, Jessica Alba (yeah, that freak show of a guru would have a chance with her), and an unusually funny Ben Kingsley all help add some flair to this ruckus tale of a Love Guru and his quest to cleanse the world with joy and peace.

3347505,5,B0013J30YU,"This movie was voted the worst of 2008 by The Golden Raspberry Awards. It actually received 3 awards. One for Worst Movie, another for Worst Screenplay, and yet another for Worst Actor, Mike Myers. It was also a certified Box Office Bomb. Now, it's things like that which usually grab my interest.

I can remember years ago reading the reviews in the papers for Mike Myers' Austin Powers movies, and the critics would almost always trash these films. When I would eventually see the movies for myself, I would enjoy them immensely. It turned out that most times a reviewer would tear apart a movie, most times I turned out to really like those movies. And this is another example of one of those movies hated by critics, but loved by me.

Mike Myers plays the character, Guru Pitka, who is a spiritual self-help Guru who longs to be the #1 Guru in the world. He is a rather silly, crude, rude, and bumbling fella who manages to get into all kinds of zany situations. Sound familiar?

Yes, Pitka is similar in a lot of respects to Myers' other famous character, Austin Powers. Myers plays the character much like he did Austin, with a sly grin, a knowing wink, and a nod to the audience, and basically hams it up for laughs all the while milking every joke for what it's worth. And ham it up he does. Which is why I love this movie.

The jokes aren't the funniest and they're nothing we haven't seen before a dozen times already, but, to see the way Mike and the rest of the cast mugs it up in their roles throughout the movie makes it all worthwhile. I found myself chuckling and giggling quite a bit at their antics. Aside from Mike Myers, Justin Timberlake and Ben Kingsley particularly seemed to really have a lot of fun with their performances.

So, if you're in the mood for some award-winning and goofy lowbrow comedy, give the Love Guru a try.",1264464000,3,1850,4.461538461538462
3347506,4,B0013J30YU,"A bunch of wisecracking comedians gather around a hockey rink in order to assist the star player of the Toronto Maple Leafs come back to his prior level of skills.  Why have his skills diminished?  Because he recently lost his girlfriend to a rival hockey player by the name of Jacque Grande, played by Justin Timberlake.  Wait, did I actually watch a film with Justin Timberlake in it?  Yes, and surprisingly, it was very good.

The story focuses around just that, Darren (played by Romany Malco), a once all-star caliber hockey player, and star player of the Maple Leafs, has begun to lose his touch in the rink.  His once legendary skills have begun to diminish, due to his recent breakup with longtime girlfriend Prudence (played by Meagan Good).  As a result of the rapid decline of the team's record, Guru Maurice Pitka (Mike Myers) is called in by the owner of the Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) to try to help Darren get his game and his girl back.

Guru Pitka is considered to be the second greatest ""love guru"" in the world.  He has written several books on the subject matter, and his ultimate goal is to appear on the Oprah show and become the number one love guru in the world.  His best shot of achieving this goal is to help Darren and the Maple Leafs reestablish themselves as a highly skilled team.  The story can be lackluster, at times, but the jokes can be quite invigorating.  Through a series of offbeat jokes and major laughs produced by not only Mike Myers, Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Verne Troyer, and Romany Malco, but also by the wisecracking announcer played by Stephen Colbert, the laughs are consistent and frequent.

Everyone in the movie seems to have something to prove, not only to themselves, but to someone else as well.  For Darren, it's proving he's more of a man than his mom thought; for Jane it's showing the fans of the Leafs that she is a competent owner; and for Guru Pitka it's much more than what he initially intended.  Many of the jokes come off as ""childish"" and immature, seeming more like jokes that junior high students would find funny, while others are actually quite good.  Mike Myers does a great job at playing the second most famous love Guru, and his humorous acronyms and abbreviations are quite unique.  Jessica Alba, as usual, is beautiful, but looks aside, she does a great job at producing a few laughs of her own.  This seemingly all-star cast did a great job despite the somewhat lacking storyline.  The blooper reel is a great special feature worth checking out as well.

3347514,3,B0013J30YU,"I fully expected to dislike this movie, in which case I wouldn't have bothered to write about it. While I like many of Mike Myers comedy instincts, I'm not keen on his saccharine observations on relationships and I just didn't think he could pull of a whole movie with ""Love"" as its explicit subject. I knew that the movie had bombed and that even many of his fans had panned this effort -- this both confirmed my thoughts that I wouldn't like the movie while strangely making me want to see what was bad enough to turn off fans and critics alike.

What I didn't know, having not been interested enough to read any of the movie reviews, was that the major plot line of the movie had as one of its two backgrounds the game of hockey. While incidental to the theme of the movie, Myers and the production team lovingly recreated the game with just the right mix of reverence and irreverence. That is to say, both the grace and the not so graceful aspects of the sport are presented with equal fervor and humor. Contrast this with the one-sided adoration of musicians versus the cartoon bad guys in ""Wayne's World"" and I would argue that Myers writing skills have improved or were at least better inspired here.

Similarly, while making fun of devotees of eastern inspired religions, the non-stop clever acronyms, double-entendres and sayings have enough truth and heart in them that you can appreciate the spirit in which they were created even while laughing at the silliness.

Finally, the slapstick elements of the movie were (with the exception of the nose jokes, for whatever reason, I just don't go for pure gross-out jokes) often laugh out loud, or at least snicker worthy. The magic carpet, the smoke bombs, the barroom brawl ending up the macho contestants laughing at objects they were impaled with, ""mini-me"" as a hard boiled NHL coach who is at one point of the movie fired into the goal thereby waking up the scoring booth lamp lighter who had fallen asleep during an interminable break in the action, a ""bollywood"" dance number at the end... Nice subtle and not-so-subtle touches throughout.

So what about the ""Love""? Did the Love Guru learn to love himself thereby freeing him to truly love others by the end of the movie? I found myself thankfully not caring about this, there was enough goodhearted intent to remove my usual skepticism regarding Myers' musings on relationships. Indeed, the overall goodnatured attitude of this movie was undoubtedly what attracted several major celebrities to participate. And if you're a fan of Stephen Colbert, you'll want to see his numerous scenes rambling on as a color commentator for the hockey TV broadcasts.

In the end I'm really not sure why so many of Mike Myers fans reacted with such disappointment to this movie: maybe the background props involving hockey and eastern religion for so many of the jokes were not as popular as those in previous efforts? Certainly more people could relate to music jokes and parodies of James Bond cinema.... So I'm thinking if you have an interest in hockey AND eastern religions AND are a Mike Myers fan, check this movie out and you might be pleasantly surprised.",1246147200,,3162,4.762773722627737

Not only did I stop watching Love Guru half-way through the movie - something I have NEVER done before - but during that time, the unthinkable happened: I looked down upon Jessica Alba.  In all seriousness, Alba's next movie could be a 90-minute monstrosity with her kicking house-pets, burning down soup kitchens, and feeding toddlers to hyenas, and I'd still probably look favorably upon her performance.  So why is this so bad?

Well, it's not me.  Into-Me-I-See.  I laughed hard at Super Troopers, Old School, Superbad, and Talladega Nights, so I'm a big fan of juvenile humor.  I quote daily from the three Austin Powers movies, as well as Wayne's World, so it's not Mike Myers.  I compared the Feast series to the Godfather series, and Johnny Knoxville consistently makes me laugh, so it has nothing to do with vulgarity.  I love Jessica Alba and midgets, so it's not Jessica Alba or Verne Troyer.  I even enjoy B-movies, so it's not the fact that this is a B-movie.

As far as the ""plot"" goes, Guru Pitka (Myers) is an American self help guru who learned his skills in India from cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudha (Ben Kingsley) (ba-dum-cha!).  Pitka is hired by a Jane Bullard (Alba), to help her emotionally dysfunctional hockey team (ba-dum-cha!).  Full of idiotic catch phrases and acronyms, Pitka hopes to dethrone Deepak Chopra as one of the resident mumbo-jumbo experts on the Oprah Show (ba-dum-cha!).  Midget joke here (ba-dum-cha!), genitalia joke there (ba-dum-cha!).

Make no mistake; it looks big budget.  The cast, crew, and everyone involved: top notch.  There are even big name cameos like Val Kilmer.  The problem is it's just not funny.  Just look at the name of Kingsley's character again to see how bad the comedy is.

When it comes to Hollywood movies, things were most certainly better when the movie business didn't release so many movies or beat successful horses until every last original thought or joke devolves into boring and fatuous formula. Welcome to the career of Mike Myers.

Maybe if the bulk of Myer's resume wasn't bullet-pointed with sequels and he hadn't showed us all the goodies in his comedy tool box; e.g., an entertaining mix of sophomoric innuendo, spot-on satire of genres, cheeky names, and the always-popular jokes regarding genitalia or bowel movements, he wouldn't have exhausted his repertoire and we wouldn't have to suffer through The Love Guru. This newest offering is as predictable as the jokes you see coming a mile away. Making it worse is that the premise isn't even that interesting. Like so many comedy movies released of late, there is a thread of a plot wrapped around ninety minutes of extremely tired jokes. The actors do their best and there are some smiles and mild chuckles, but most of it is just groan-inducing and expected.

I really like Mike Myers and want to believe that he has some great movies left in him, but to take several years to come up with this yawn-fest makes me question my beliefs.

Then in 2003 he made awful ""The Cat in the Hat."" We waited for five years since then and what we get is ""The Love Guru,"" another disappointing film from Mike Myers.

""The Love Guru"" has none of the style that made ""Austin Powers"" such a success. Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka, an American-born self help guru raised in India. Without letting us know how and why he was raised in India and became a guru, the film proceeds to tell us that Guru Pitka is hired by a hockey team owner played by Jessica Alba because her team's star player, she believes, really needs the help of the spiritual leader. But why a hockey player?

I know comedy is a subjective thing. Not everybody is going to laugh at the same thing. Don't get me wrong. I like silly jokes. I like sex jokes. But something is definitely wrong with the comedy when the actors start to look like desperate standup comic or clown waiting for laughs that will never come, trying to make us laugh with whatever gags he thinks of - cross-eyed Ben Kingsley's mentor, repetitious ""Mariska Hargitay"" mantra and of course, elephants.

Perhaps ""The Love Guru,"" Mike Myers's Razzie-winning comedy, does not deserve the award given to the year's worst film.

Now what do these comedies have in common with this movie? well to be perfectly blunt, nothing! except they have a ""Desi"" or Indian humor melted into it!  i was surprised how Mike (chastity belt wearing neo-philosopher) Myers was able to pull off the accent and the movements, gestures so perfectly.  The guy really reinvented himself in this film.  I heard allot from people that this film is not cohesive, not related to anything and just makes people loose interest!  I totally understand that especially myself being a mixed bag of potatoes myself!

Sadly the audience to really get this film have to have had some affinity with the following forms of humor:

British / American / Indo-Asian /

This might sound a bit wacky but every ""hybrid"" (which i define having been brought up in all those 3 cultural settings) i have spoken to finds this movie a masterpiece!  Other folks just could not get the humor which is fine! Overall this film has made me laugh no matter how many time i have watched it! (15 by my count)",1228003200,2,2230,6.251633986928105

Mike Myers plays the Love Guru, not a dissimilar role to those seen in Austin Power movies, however, the comedy is definitely strong throughout this whole movie.

The Guru is a kid who is taken in by a group that look Indian, but pretty much fictional who teach him that to find love, you must first find love in yourself...yadda yadda... anyway, he grows up and is hired by a woman to go back to Canada with him to help there star Ice Hockey player get himself together.

It doesn't sound like much of a plot to be helping him, himself and others to find a happy ending sort of thing, but it's a comedy, and the comedy works pretty well through out most of the movie.

It won't win any prizes for greatest character or plot, or any best film awards, but who cares, it's just a feel good comedy with typical Mike Myers humor all through it.

3347546,3,B0013J30YU,"First of all let me begin by saying that if I were a fan of Comedies I would have given this a four, but comedies because of their lack of realism are not my forte.

That being said, after viewing the average that this movie has (on Amazon) I was afraid to watch. I watched it however, because the cast seemed stellar enough.

After having watched the film I can honestly say that it was ammusing. There were parts that were meant to be funny and didn't do the trick and the unrealism found in most comedies was rampant but it was done in a very silly manner and the writing was sharp- atleast the way dialoque was used in order to get a smile (sorry not big on comedies) out of people. The acting was also quite good and some of the characters are flatline enough to be believable.

However, I don't think that this film is appropriate for a 13 year old. It is rated PG13 but I wouldn't show it to anyone under 15 and I think it would actually be appropriate for 16+. Some of the jokes have a tad too much perversion and I think that it will take an older crowd to understand them and more importantly understand the gist of it which is to ammuse and possibly shock but not to represent anything in particular.

All in all I would say that it was an hour in a half well spent.

Also, after reading some of the reviews it seems that most people are not impressed by it because of what they expect from Mike Myers. I honestly, don't expect anything in particular from him as I don't, as already mentioned, really have an interest in comedy or comedians. All I can say is that I would spend the time and the couple of dollars to watch a movie like this again. I think it was good work.",1227052800,,1683,4.166153846153846

The team has a chance to win the Stanley Cup if its star can focus on hockey and not on the fact that his wife has left him for a rival player, nicknamed ""Le Coq."" I know it sounds like a recipe for a bad sports movie, but it isn't. The movie really has little to do with hockey at all. The focus is on Mike Myers's schtick and Justin Timberlake delivering comedy gold (as Le Coq).

The movie had a few hilarious scenes, but was just decent overall. I know it has not been well-reviewed by anyone, but I think most people's expectations were way too high. This is Mike Myers rehashing a few of the old bits that have brought him success in the Austin Powers franchise. His interaction with Vern Troyer (more affectionately known as Mini Me) is silly and for some people it is past its prime.

Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) is the star player of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. Unfortunately Darren is having problems with his marriage and the stress has caused his game to fall off and the result has been a losing streak for the Maple Leafs. Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) the owner of the team is determined to get them back to their winning ways and prove to herself and the fans that the poor performances of the Maple Leafs is not her fault. To do this she enlist the help of Guru Maurice Pitka (Mike Myers) in hopes of reconciling the relationship between Darren and his wife Prudence who is now involved in a passionate relationship with Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake) who is a goalie for the Maple Leaf's Rival. Guru Pitka, motivated by the possibility that he may overtake Deepak Chopra as the number 1 Guru agrees to take the job and hilarity ensues...

I was skeptical going in as I wasn't the least bit impressed with the trailer but since I felt Myers had the talent to write good movies and carry them with his acting that I would give it a shot. Unfortunately my initial impression was the correct one and the movie was very disappointing.

The Good: It is always nice to see Jesica Alba on screen even when her performance feels half hearted as it did in this. I had no problems with the look and sound of the movie. As much as I hate to admit it, Justin Timberlake gave a decent performance or as good of one as could be giver for his character.

The Bad: It is always bad when the comedy in a comedy falls flat and doesn't work as is the case in ""The Love Guru"". The vast majority of the humor just doesn't work and feels forced. Myers also need to stop creating work for Verne Troyer or at least pull it way back to minor roles as that bit has run it's course as far as getting laughs. The story overall is ludicrous which is typical of Myers' movies and would have been fine had the comedy been strong enough to carry the movie but since it fell flat you as a viewer are left to pick apart everything else.

Overall: ""The Love Guru"" just felt like Mike Myers was trying to cash in on the last bit of buzz his name has to offer. If you are looking for a laugh try picking up one of Judd Aptow's latest movies or if you need a Mike Myers fix pick up one of his older titles but skip this one.",1225238400,,3479,5.423290203327172

3347556,2,B0013J30YU,"The Love Guru, starring Mike Myers, is a bad, horrible film in so many ways. I'm writing my review in honor of the many Razzies that the film was recently nominated for.

Mike Myers has been a part of some great comedies over the last two decades from Waynes World, to Austin Powers to Shrek. Mike Myers can't be funny playing himself, or at least hasn't really tried to in film. He is great, however, at creating characters. At least until the Love Guru came along.

The Guru Pitka is a horrible character that is horribly played by Mike Myers. First, the Guru is a satire on Deepok Chopra I guess. Deepok Chopra is an extremely obscure pop culture reference to make an entire movie about. Second, as I watched the film, I could easily pick out the parts that were supposed to be funny or inspired, but the were instead painful and sad. Myers looks pathetic as the Guru Pitka, and it is even more saddening to watch the joy and zest with which he gave the character. Myers for some reason thought America would enjoy this character.

If you do decide to watch this movie, you will wonder what movie executive thought this film should be released in the summer. This movie is historically bad. The only good part about the movie is the supporting cast with Romany Malco, Verne Troyer, Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake and Ben Kingsley.

Avoid the temptation to watch this movie. It is not funny under any circumstances.",1224720000,,1418,4.570866141732283
3347557,2,B0013J30YU,"Star and co-writer Mike Myers is far too clever to be dismissed entirely for a film burdened by his kitchen-sink approach to comedy. However, this 2008 film comes closest to making him downright intolerable despite a smattering of smart one-liners that barely save it from landing in the junk bin.  The concept would seem ripe with possibilities as the film lampoons the commercial intentions of self-help gurus like Deepak Chopra, but Myers and his writing partner Graham Gordy appear more interested in bodily functions, gross-out humor, repetitive gags (""Mariska Hargitay""), Canadian in-jokes, and celebrity walk-ons rather than keep the satirical aspects focused enough to make a point. Unfortunately, first-time director Marco Schnabel simply lets the star and the rest of the lackluster cast flounder without lending a perspective that could have balanced the lowbrow shenanigans with the highbrow aspirations. As unsatisfying as the film is, I wonder if Judd Apatow could have saved this material.

The overextended plot revolves around self-help guru Maurice Pitka, who was born in America but raised in India. With his long hair and beard and traditional Hindu garb, Pitka is known as a second-rate Chopra, but he is aggressively looking for an opportunity to change that and get on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Enter Darren Roanoke, star player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who goes into a scoring slump just as the team makes the Stanley Cup playoffs. Team owner Jane Bullard and coach Punch Cherkov seek out Pitka to help Roanoke reconcile with his wife Prudence, who has caused his beleaguered lack of self-esteem. She has decided to leave him for the conjugal joys to be had with Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande, the goalie for the opposing Los Angeles Kings known for his elephantine endowment. Pitka espouses his radical ""DRAMA"" method of enlightenment to alleviate Roanoke's stress and lead him on a journey toward self-love. Apparently that's the only chance that the Maple Leafs have in winning the Cup. At the same time, Pitka realizes his goal to usurp Chopak is a hollow one when he becomes romantically drawn to the comely Bullard.

Myers may have gone to the well one too many times with his smarmy, overly self-aware performance as Pitka. What goodwill he generated as Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers has almost evaporated here. As Bullard, Jessica Alba is a pretty but unavoidably wooden foil to Myers, and her character's attraction to Pitka remains one of the film's bigger mysteries. Somewhat better is Romany Malco as Roanoke and Justin Timberlake as Grande, though neither is imposing enough to be particularly believable as professional hockey players. As a more verbal version of Mini-Me, Verne Troyer plays Cherkov in constant foul-mouthed agitation. The most embarrassing performance, however, belongs to a cross-eyed Ben Kingsley as Pitka's spiritual mentor, Guru Tugginmypudha. I doubt if any other Oscar winner has taken quite as discreet a fall from grace. On the other hand, I have to admit I liked the sitar revamp of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5"" as the irrelevant opening theme, as well as Stephen Colbert's funny bits with Jim Gaffigan as the play-by-play commentators. But that's about it.

The extras are abundant on the 2008 DVD if you care to view them. First, there is a standard making-of featurette, ""Mike Myers and The Love Guru - An Inside Look"" that runs ten minutes with comments from Myers, Alba, Troyer, and Schnabel. There is a six-minute short, ""One Helluva Elephant"", showing how special effects specialist Ron Stefaniuk built an animatronic elephant and ostrich for the movie. More interesting is ""Hockey Training for Actors"" which has sports coordinator Mark Ellis explaining how the actors learned to play hockey. Rounding out the extras are eleven deleted/extended scenes, a four-minute blooper reel, a separate five-minute compilation of deleted takes with Colbert and Gaffigan (the best of the extras and even better than the movie), ten minutes more of general outtakes, and the original theatrical trailer.",1224633600,2,4056,5.178353658536586

But I sat through each of those stinkers, right through to the end titles.  This one didn't even earn that level of interest and respect.  By forty minutes, I had had enough of the idiotic humor, the flat jokes, the bad characters, Myers wallowing in his own grossly overinflated sense of comedic creativity and personal hip-itude, and I had no interest at all in seeing how it would all turn out.

Myers plays a wacky Indian guru, a holy man specializing in love and relationships, but he has neither love nor a relationship of his own, and a clanking elephant-head chastity belt to boot.  The guru comes across as self-centered, money-grubbing, commercially prostituted, demented, capricious, manipulative and foul.  There is no serenity, no grace, not the slightest indication of any kind of scholarly depth, just a rapid-fire stream of idiotic caca-doody and genital jokes.  It's all urine and feces, phallic goofs, simulated pain inflicted on male sexual parts, the kind of stuff I found trite once I matured into 7th grade.  Now, I love the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackass/dp/B000BDH69O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackass</a>&nbsp;movies, so I know from funny in slapstick agony, genitals and excretory humor.  But this film was just mindless, moronic junk, a collection of Myers' jokes and stupid puns, the stuff that didn't make the cut for the second Austin Powers sequel, run together with a contrived, meandering, patchwork, pathetically predictable story.

If you've seen the film, you'll know that Myers' Guru Pitka would say that this film is pure Comprehensive Radical Adjustment Participation.

I mean, in the scene in which Myer's guru and his destined love have their first big date, he has arranged a very special meal which looks exactly like human testicles.  Both he and Jessica Alba bray their way through the endless stupid jokes, it all ending with the hilariously beaten and mutilated edible having to be discarded.  We've already been beaten over the head that the guru wants Alba as THE love of his incongruously empty life, and so this is the way he, The Love Guru, the man who has so much depth and experience in love and relationships, creates his first impression for his one-and-only?  Absolute garbage.

Myers' Indian guru character offended even me, and I'm about as white-bread as they come.  His bad Indian accent drifted in between the Saturday Night Live/""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" Scottish Dad, Fat Bastard and Shrek.  I mean, he couldn't even take the time to get his Indian accent down, so busy was he working on these complex, meaningful, mutually reinforcing gags about elephant dung and fighting with mops dripping with the fresh urine of his deeply honored guru-master.

Vern Troyer is reduced to spewing profanities, being the butt of increasingly vicious little-person jokes and a series of demeaning, ugly sight gags in which he is always the victim of physical violence.

Ben Kingsley--the guy who played freeking Gandhi, and won the Oscar for it--is reduced to playing a cross-eyed clown.  Sad.

Jessica Alba is stunning, predictably, but still just can't act, even in this shallow story.

And then there was the endless parade of celebs who want to be in a Mike Myers film, from Val Kilmer to Oprah, bad and forced cameos all, the kind of overblown star-packing formula that made me puke in ""Goldmember.""

The only good part I encountered lasted all of 20 seconds, a wonderfully done, detailed spin on the typical Bollywood boy-girl musical number, with Myers and Alba.  It was great, right down to the disorienting camera zooms, the impossible physical backdrops, the music and lyrics, the nauseatingly deep, warbling color and a jittery box with understated yet funny subtitles.  This was what this film should have been.

In his quest to become the next Deepak Chopra, Guru Pitka (Myers) learns the valuable lesson that patience and doing things right the first time is best for all persons, including himself.

Clearly, not everyone is going to be entertained by this movie, but I bet a good percentage of you out there would think it's a so-so movie, just as I thought.  It had highly entertaining moments.

Mike is actually pretty funny. Sure the jokes are old, but they're still pretty funny. Justin Timberlake is really hilarious in this. I loved his French Canadian accent and he was so funny.

I felt Jessica Alba was a bit flat. I kept waiting for her character to do something, but she never really did until the very end. I wish they had used Meagan Good more in this film. I think she's a really good actress and I felt like many of the times when she was silent she could have said something to inhance the film.

3347565,2,B0013J30YU,"Poor Mike Myers. The guy has a talent for creating clueless catchy characters that all basically run on a fuel of catch-phrases, sight-gags, and pokes at then current points of pop-culture. And usually it works. Works well. From teenage Metal fans Wayne's World, to a stranger in a strange land Austin Powers, when it comes to original creations, Mike Myers really has done well for himself. But how far can you use the exact same template, just changing it's color each time before the format grows stale?

Six years seems about right.

Because it's been six years since the last Austin Powers film Goldmember, and now Myers is back with a brand new character Guru Pitka, a self-help spiritual advisor who's second only to real-life equivalent Deepak Chopra. When Pitka gets an offer to help the Tiger Woods of Hockey Darren Roanoke (the Chris Rock-lite Romany Malco) get out of his romantic funk after losing the love of his life, he himself finds the same in the team's owner, played curiously by Jessica Alba, who I figure she thought she was originally appearing in Austin Powers IV. Along the way, you get a variety of secondary cast members by the likes of Justin Timberlake (who steals the show as a Canadian well-endowed goalie who stole Roanoke's love), Stephen Colbert (doing his Report as if it was Sportscenter), Ben Kingsley (who has offically flushed his credibly down the toliet here as Pitka's crossed-eyed mentor), and ""please give me a job"" Verne Troyer.

But what is painfully obvious literally minutes into this film is that all it really is, is a reworking of those Austin Powers movies. Instead of big glasses & funky teeth, it's a beard and big nose. Instead of an exaggerated British accent, it's an over-the-top Indian one. He even stoops to a few musical parodies in this too, sound painfully familiar? And when Powers had tons of humorous innunendo borderline-risque sight-gags, Guru follows suit, but feeling extremely forced and stale this time around. There are tons of word-play style jokes here that just scream ""Yeah, Baby!"" that will have your eyes rolling back into your head faster than you can say Linda Blair. And 80% of them you will see coming. This was just too expected of Myers to do after patenting that style of humor he's known for from way back in his SNL days. Granted, about 3/4 into the film the character might grow on you a little more, but even with a second viewing you'll still think half these jokes would have worked better out of the mouth of say Dr. Evil.

The disc isn't too bad for extras with a documentary, outakes, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel (which looks like nobody on-set was really laughing all that hard to begin with), but this film won't sit next to Wayne's World or Austin Powers on your shelf without hiding behind it's fakey beard. Too much like a rehash of former greatness to be considered good on it's own, Mike Myers needs to find himself a writer that can present him in a whole new light without the crutch of body-part jokes and funny plastic faces to only carry him through.

On the other hand, there is another valid line of thought that would argue anyone who would watch a Mike Myers film is incapable of rational, conscious thought. A point well taken I must admit. With that said, if you're still reading this review we know what camp you fall into.

In the '08 film `The Love Guru' Mr. Myers plays Guru Pitka, the second most popular spiritual teacher in the Occidental world, second to Deepak Chopra of course. Guru Pitka finally gets the opportunity to possibly move out of the number two position when he's hired by the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team (Jessica Alba) to restore the broken marital relationship between their star player and his estranged wife who has moved in with the Los Angeles Kings well endowed goalie (Justin Timberlake).  If he's successful he will not only be handed a two million dollar check but has been promised a booking to appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show! As you should have already guessed his spiritual instructional methods are, shall we say suspect and the storyline loaded with the usual gag routines, inside jokes and shots at anyone and everyone. In other words typical Mike Myers faire.

Oh! I also enjoyed comedian Daniel Tosh in his minute-long role as 'cowboy hat' I think that in a film so, so terrible he was a shining star. Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan were also nice as the hockey announcers.

Other then that, the Guru Pitka(Mike Myers) is an unfunny and annoying Guru from India(with Catch phrases and everything!) who's trying to triumph over his rival Deepak Chopra and go on the Oprah show. And of course, the only way this is all possible is for Pitka to succeed in reuniting hockey player Darren Roanoke(Romany Malco)and his wife Prudence(Meagan Good).

... right?

Anywho, let's take a quick look at the film.  The plot:  Guru Pitka (Myers), while on a quest to become the next Deepak Chopra, is hired by Toronto Maple Leafs GM Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) to help Leafs star Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) win his estranged wife (Meagan Goode) back from Los Angeles Kings goaltender/crazy Celine Dion fan Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake), who's known for his large... you get the picture.  In helping out Roanoke, Pitka must put away his fears towards relationships himself, as well as determine whether fame or fortune are as important as living up to the standards he preaches.  Will he sell out or will he do the right thing?

(I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it shouldn't take a rocket scientist to answer that question because there are no surprises in this film.)

So how did it do?  The movie was as asinine as suggesting that the Kings or Leafs will be Cup contenders in the near future.  Unlike the Austin Powers movies, it's becoming harder to pretend that all of Mike Myers' characters are anyone else other than, well, Mike Myers.  The weak and redundant plot attempts to use a barrage of toilet jokes to keep it afloat, but largely fails after 20 minutes or so.  Had the style of humor been used less frequently, it would have elicited a better response.  Yet the use of the constant gags to keep the story line afloat should have given way to the notion that the move was less of an artistic endeavor and more of a vehicle for Myers to showcase his love of hockey and his celebrity buddies.

However, there were a few things that saved this movie.  For starters, despite limited screen time, Timberlake was oddly funny as his French-Canadian counterpart.  Further, Stephen Colbert was hilarious as the HNIC announcer and had great chemistry with the other co-announcer Jim Gaffigan.  Finally, in an oddly prophetic move, the two teams that L.A. and Toronto are shown having their way with en route to the Stanley Cup Finals were Detroit and Pittsburgh, who actually contended for the Cup.

But, it is not as bad as everyone out there is apt to point out.

Agreed - the humor is mostly bad, it's full of genitalia jokes, and some really ""bad taste"" sequences (look out for the mop-fight!), but I wouldn't just trash the movie as yet.

Myers plays an Indian Love Guru (anyone said ""Peter Sellers in The Party""?) named Guru Pitka, taught by a squint-eyed Ben Kingsley (why? and more importantly, how?) to spread the message of peace and love to the world, but bound by a vow (read ""chastity belt""), until such time as he begins to love himself, above all else.

This last part didn't make sense (yes! even more than the other stuff!) to me. But then, we'll come back to this a little later.

He has nightmares about being the second-best Guru in the business, always behind the eponymous Deepak Chopra. To become numero uno, he must prove he is good enough by re-uniting an estranged hockey player with his wife, which would win him an invitation from Oprah, which, in turn, would make him No. 1.

The plot is not funny, and largely, neither is the cast. But I have to admit I couldn't keep from laughing my a** off on more than one ocassion. Myers' speciality is to shock you and force you to break into a laughter, a stunt which the Guru Pitka also pulls many times during the movie, and succeeds quite often in.

The sillyness index is quite high, but if you have time on your hand and have a chance to see this flick, you might actually give it a second thought.

Cameo appearances by Jessica Simpson, Val Kilmer, Mariska Hargitay (Det. Olivia Benson on Law & Order: SVU), and Deepak Chopra fill the gaps in the movie.

Uh, and yes, about that remark ""love yourself, above all else"" makes sense when Chopra meets Guru P. and says ""You are free"", to which the GP replies, ""I'm no longer the next Deepak Chopra, I'm the first Guru Pitka"".

Peppered by such quips intermittently, and a laugh here-and-there, the movie was enough to make me watch it full and not discard it simply because so many people did.

3347594,3,B0013J30YU,"From the moment I first heard Mike Meyer's new film ""The Love Guru"" and Steve Carell's new film ""Get Smart"" would be released on the same day, I was surprised. Common practice in Hollywood dictates you don't release two such similar films on the same day. At best, you are going to split the audience, and both films could suffer. This seems to have been born out by the box office, with ""The Love Guru"" suffering.

Because both films were released on the same day, I decided to see both, back to back. And I am going to write about both, back to back.

The Love Guru ***
Get Smart *

I really get the sense Mike Meyer's is trying to channel the spirit of Peter Sellers. Consciously or not, he has created two characters with more than a few similarities to some of Sellers' most famous creations. Austin Powers has more than a few things in common with Inspector Clouseau and now the Guru Pitka has more than a few things in common with Harundai V. Bakshi, Sellers character in the less well-known Blake Edward's film ""The Party"". Meyers is a talented guy, a funny guy, who seems to obsess over every detail in his films. Sellers was, reportedly, the same way. While Sellers' characters will continue to endure the test of time, we don't know if the more modern Meyer's work will have the same outcome. It's too early to tell.

Meyer's ""The Love Guru"" is a silly film. From the moment I first saw the trailer, I laughed, a lot. Filled with silly, ""Austin Powers""-esque comedy, there were a lot of jokes packed in that trailer and the movie delivers more of the same.

The movie is very silly and packed with jokes, many of which work and many of which don't. The jokes fly fast and furious, and Meyers certainly tries very hard to get the audience to laugh. I half expected someone to throw a cream pie at Meyers. But there is also the smack of familiarity to many of the jokes. They could easily have been trans planted into ""Austin Powers 4"" and provided the same laughs. It also seems odd that Verne Troyer is also in the new film, playing a different character, but his presence makes the comparisons to Austin Powers all the more prevalent. And many of the jokes concerning his character revolve around the same humor Mini-Me elicited in the Powers films.

If anything is to be learned from Meyer's comedy, he loves midgets and fart jokes, both providing equal opportunity for laughs.

Meyers has done a lot of interviews and in many he has mentioned the profound impact the death of his father had on his life. This led him to meet Depak Chopra, the very famous guru and self-help coach who has apparently provided Meyers with a lot of guidance. ""The Love Guru"" tells the story of Guru Pitka, the Number Two guru in the United States, behind Deepak Chopra. Pitka desperately wants to become Number One and the Toronto Maple Leafs provide him with an opportunity, their star goalie Darren Roanoake (Romany Malco, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") has broken up with his wife Prudence (Meagan Good) and is not playing well. With the Stanley Cup around the corner, the team's owner, Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba), hires Pitka to bring Roanoke and Prudence back together. Naturally, there are complications. Pitka finds himself attracted to Jane and Prudence is dating the star goalie for the Los Angeles Kings, a Celine Dion-loving Canadian, Jacques ""The Cock"" Grande (Justin Timberlake).

Meyers lets the jokes fly fast and furious; from the opening frames when we hear narration by Morgan Freeman, to the Guru Pitka's constant use of bad trademarked sayings, the film has a lot of laughs. But Meyers is also dependent on scatological humor and there are a lot of jokes involving farts, bowel movements, accidents and more, jokes too silly for even this film.

""The Love Guru"" suffers from a number of small problems. The first is the humor throughout the film is so juvenile; it is extremely hit and miss. Everyone can only take so many fart jokes or jokes about 'messing your pants'. The other thing I found odd about the film is that at a couple of key moments, they don't go far enough with the ideas. Early on, Pitka remembers a key moment in his life and we watch it much like a Bollywood film, complete with scratches and film burn. This is a great idea and only reinforces the wackiness of the story and the idea, but it only lasts a few moments. At the end of the film, Pitka claims ""I want to dance"" and a Bollywood musical number begins in a small seaside village. Jessica Alba dances out, his assistant becomes a part of the entourage, even Verne Troyer takes part. This is a moment, much like the end of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", when you would expect all of the characters to join in and start dancing in a highly synchronized way to an American rock song, in this case ""The Rocker"". But the dance number only involves the few characters mentioned and only lasts a few seconds. It seems like they ran out of money and simply had to get what they could.

Also, I have seen a number of films recently in which well-known comedians play Sports Commentators (most of these star Will Farell as he seems to have the lock on this franchise, ""Semi-Pro"", ""Blades of Glory""). In ""The Love Guru"", Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan play hockey commentators and they suffer from the same fate as the others; they simply aren't funny. Each of these characters is decidedly ""wacky"", and says ""off-color"" things, and tries to act like they are weird and funny. But in each of these films, the characters look like they are trying to act weird and funny and this does little than to slow down the rest of the story.

It is amusing that Meyers is making fun of something so ripe for parody. But he also takes aim at the very type of thing Chopra has risen above, making his character a more desperate version of someone like Chopra. It works, but not all the time.",1215388800,4,5854,4.539336492890995
3347595,4,B0013J30YU,"I'm usually quite tepid toward comedy films of any kind.  I like smart comedy, stuff that makes me laugh at more than seeing two elephants, um, copulating.

In recent years I've read all sorts of reviews that try to find more depth in a movie than it, on the surface, even proclaims to offer.

The Love Guru, for as silly as it is, had me laughing through about 90%.  Admittedly I'm biased toward all things Indian (and this didn't quite stand up to 2003 The Guru), but it showed the writer's paid due attention to the things they were parodying.  Plus, the issues they addressed (infidelity, self-help, work stress, etc.) are ones that can speak to a wide swath of people.  Sometimes reaching the widest target audience with politically driven comedies misses the mark (in my mind I refer to You Don't Mess With the Zohan).

Sure this movie has had a luke-warm response by many (the trusted Week magazine shamefully gave it a one-star..blech), but I think anyone who watches this film and expects any more than a good time with some fun Mike Myers past references, is bound to be disappointed.

Heck, I had to watch Dumb and Dumber 6 times before it made me laugh.  It's all about letting your mind open up.

As for The Love Guru cast, all had their high points:

Mike Meyers: Funny and goofy as ever.  I laughed most when he got the bathroom scribbling joke and when he sang More Than Words...the latter due primarily to his get-up.

Justin Timberlake: Why do people scoff so? I don't know much about the Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, but I imagine that Timberlake portrayed a fine parody of one.

Jessica Alba: Her character fit the least well, but she stood on her own.  A good sport for doing things Bollywood style.

Ben Kingsley: from Gandhi to Guru Tugginmypudha, what more shall I say?

Verne Troyer:  Not that this man wasn't funny before, but I really liked his bad-a** attitude as the Coach.

Overall, the names were silly (if you don't catch their meaning phonetically, then read them some where), the jokes were constant, the meaning was superficial, but it was all around a very good time.",1214784000,5,2099,4.639566395663957
