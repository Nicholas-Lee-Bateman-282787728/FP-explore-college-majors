2971732,5,B000WH5AX8,"I have done this workout and make no mistake it is definately cardiovascular! just because it is loads of fun doesn't mean it isn't an arobic workout. There are 3 15-minute workouts on the disc, each increasing in difficulty.
the title is not kidding when it says ""burn"" because there is a lot of bouncing involved. The moves take a lot of concentration as they require much coordination and you will feel very worked at the end of it.
There is much stretching so that you won't become sore. Every few minutes they lead you through a short period of stretches to workout mostly ankles and feet and shins because that is the bouncing areas.
The teacher, Hemalayaa instructs you with voice-over. Hemalayaa is an energetic, creative, knowledgable and confident instructor. I enjoyed myself, doing this video!
Special features include: a bonus performance of freestyle dancing and option of workout soundtrack without the intstruction.",1200268800,,931,5.0519480519480515
2971733,5,B000WH5AX8,"Part of our New Year's resolution, my honey and I, was getting back into moving and exercising more. Well, we really got into the swing with this one! The 15 minute segments make it easy to do, even when I'm feeling lazy.

It's easy to be happy with this DVD. We both worked up a sweat doing the shimmy and steppin' high with Hemalayaa. She's very upbeat and lighthearted, which kept us both engaged and relaxed. Laughing a lot makes it easier to not overfocus on our mistakes and lack of coordination. And right now, I'm pretty uncoordinated, believe me.

I had to modify some of the jumps and hops, but I've gotten used to that since I hurt my knee last year. It was great to have a man in the video and I noticed his moves were a little more subtle and solid, which gave my guy and I permission to not overdo it. But we still got a workout!

The best part? I put it on again a couple of days later and my partner got up from his desk (!) and came over on his own to hop around with me. No nagging required. Yaaayyy!!!

Definitely recommended!",1199491200,21,1045,4.1840796019900495

2971735,5,B000WH5AX8,"Hemalayaa is truly a gift and the real thing...her gift and goal is from the heart, not from or to a superficial ego-inflating place....I was fortunate to take a workshop with her at a yoga conference....behind all the strutting and effort and bouncing and preening was a true devotional practice, from the heart and with heart....I am happy that I can continue to work with her via dvd and absorb her teachings....love love",1199491200,3,424,4.821917808219178
2971736,5,B000WH5AX8,"I just did this workout and I must say that I sweated bullets. You can see a trailer at the acaciacatalog web site.
Setting:  Theatre stage with teacher and two dancers, 1 woman and 1 guy.  This time the backup dancers are quite good and look like they are enjoying the choreography.

workout:  the dvd is divided into 3 workouts, each with its own warm-up, learn the steps, routine and cool down. The cool down is brief for segments 1 &2 in the event you want to do segment 3.  The steps are easy and fun.  BE WARNED, MANY OF THE STEPS ARE HIGH IMPACT.  I have bad knees and I had to modify the criss cross jumping jacks, half jacks, hop turns and jumps.  No modifications are shown on the video.  However, I am aerobically out of shape and I still got my heart rate up doing low impact.

Music:  This is bhangra hip hop music. The music is different for each segment. The teacher is in voice over and she is much louder than the music.  There is a music only option and when you hear it without her talking, it is quite good and rhythmic.

Overall:  A good workout that is edited and choreographed much better than her bollywood workout dvd. There is also a free dance special feature with the 3 dancers clowning around.  Next time I do this, I will use the music only option as it is pretty easy to visually follow. the production quality is very good and the steps are in beat with the music.  The camera loves Hemalayaa and she and her dancers are a joy to watch,",1195084800,61,1468,4.245487364620939
2971757,2,B000WH5AX8,"Several times, the voice over says to do one thing while the dancers are doing another, and changes come too quickly to follow. There isn't enough instruction on posture and moves to keep me from injuring myself, and the hopping is way too much. I tried this workout a handful of times, but this last time, I injured a knee and a foot. I like Hemalayaa's energy, but this video isn't for beginners, even if she mentions that beginners can do it. It's for people who already know how to do this kind of dancing.",1423094400,2,510,4.378947368421053

2971762,3,B000WH5AX8,"It would take a lethal dose of caffeine for me to keep up with Hemalayaa's perkiness and propensity for jumping jacks.  While these routines are built up from basic moves, making it fairly easy to follow, good luck keeping up if you don't have excellent knees or a handy trampoline nearby.  These workouts are challenging and will burn a lot of calories if you can stick with them!  The problem is that it's rather boring to watch--just three dancers on a stage with a white background and the music gets repetitive after awhile.  I found myself thinking that actually just going for a jog would be an easier way to get in some cardio.",1408492800,,635,4.543859649122807
2971763,5,B000WH5AX8,"I am most certainly NOT in shape right now, but I love Bollywood movies, and I love the idea of dancing for fitness.  One original concern I had about this video was whether or not the instructions would be in English -- whew!  They are.  That's the first plus for me.  As much as I like Hindi language films, I don't speak Hindi or exercise to it.

My second concern was whether I would be able to do it.  Not only am I not fit, but I am also not a dancer.  Well, I'm pleased to say that I can keep up.  Hemalayaa starts out slow and repetitive and then she takes the moves we've learned and puts them into choreography.  It really is fun and easy enough to keep up with, although I'm hoping to keep getting more polished as I continue working with this video.

The third thing I especially like about this workout is that it's divided into three portions.  Since I'm just starting,  I'm doing one section per day.  I don't remember how long the last section is, but the first two are each about sixteen minutes long.  That's just perfect for where I am right now, and I am hoping to eventually gain strength and endurance enough to do the whole thing at once.

Finally, besides being fun dance moves, these exercises really work the whole body.  Hemalayaa states that we'll be working the thighs and buttocks, but I feel the burn all over.  As we are doing knee bends or lunges, for example, we are also doing arm movements and twisting the torso.  It feels good all over.

Incidentally, I also have arthritis, and so far the movements haven't felt damaging to my joints.  Of course, I really haven't taken the exercise to full energy yet or done as much jumping as Hemalayaa does, either.  She continually encourages the participant to do only what feels right, and she offers suggestions for alternative movements for those who can't do all of the choreography.  I really love this video, and I'm hoping not only to lose weight and get toned, but also to learn the full routine and someday perform it for my husband.  It gives me something to look forward to.  :)",1402444800,6,2067,4.4217506631299734
2971764,5,B000WH5AX8,"This is a really great and fun workout.  You're dancing Bollywood style.  It starts off slowly and works up to more difficult moves and tempo.  I look like a total clod but know I'll get better.

Hemelaya is very charming and encouraging.  She laughs a lot.",1399248000,,257,4.5
2971765,4,B000WH5AX8,"I have been using this video along with the bollywood dance video of hers!! These videos are great workout, and I always work up a sweat. Each is about 45 minutes of exercise. I love to dance, and I am pakistani and have experience in doing indian style dances. The moves are so fun, and easy to learn for me. I started the videos about three weeks ago, and changed my diet a little to lose weight. I have only done these two videos about twice a week, and I am seeing a result and a difference in my body. I highly recommend her videos!

This particular video has hemalayaa along with two back up dancers including a male dancer, and female dancer. There is a lot of bouncing, jumping and fast foot movements. It can be quite a stress on your feet, so make sure you warm those up pretty well. There are 4 workouts and after each workout, there are cool downs and stretches to help the body slow down and recover after the fast movements and jumping. This workout is totally worth it though, because it is definitely helping me slim down! Thank you Hemalayaa you rock!!! :)",1394236800,,1073,4.338308457711443

I only purchased this at all, because I had a special credit/discount for a video purchase. It covered the majority of the cost, but I still feel like we were ripped off.

2971785,1,B000WH5AX8,"This is not a workout.  It has a few cute moves with lots of shoulder shrugging, but:
1) the first 15 minutes have zero potential to raise your heart rate
2) the other 15 minute blocks raise your heart rate for only one minute, when you put all the moves together
3) the pacing is completely off -- any time you think you're going to actually work out, they start doing stretches and slow moves that blow it.
I especially don't understand the worthless foot twists, bows to the floor, etc....and suspect Hemalayaa is mostly using these as an opportunity for hair flips.  In short, don't waste your money (that's what you're doing, if you're actually buying this with the idea that it is about fitness).  The CRUNCH videos are easily as fun, and manage to get your heart rate up and keep it there, if only for 20 minutes or so.",1351296000,,826,4.421052631578948
2971786,1,B000WH5AX8,"I LOVED Hemalayaa's workouts on my On Demand Fitness channel, so I bought this video. Even though other people warned me about the poor choreography, the strange timing and the terrible hopping in place--which, the way she does it, is very very bad for your tendons and knees--I thought they were just overcritical and negative.
But they were not being overcritical.
I have been dancing my whole life for joy and exercise and I have never had any issues with my knees or ankles. This video gave me issues immediately. When I showed the moves to my doctor, she freaked out.
The entire middle section consists of jumping and hopping around in place.

Please be careful. Though I have truly valued her very loving and terrifically fun other workouts--I warn you not to buy this one!",1350691200,11,779,4.727941176470588
2971787,4,B000WH5AX8,"I enjoyed the video. The dances were appropriately challenging for a novice who is in generally good shape. Hemalayaa is charming too. The reason I didn't love it is that there was no culmination of the instruction in a final complete dance, and the music wasn't as exciting as it could have been.",1349827200,,297,4.622641509433962
2971788,3,B000WH5AX8,This is a fun workout than will have you sweating immediately! The music is great and the teacher gives good instruction and the pace is just right. If your a larger person like myself you may find some of the dance moves and the jumping around to be hard on your knees. I would be careful doing this video and maybe just glaze over those parts until your physically ready. Some of the thing she does in the video can be dangerous for a person carrying a lot of excess weight. Find your own limits and don't do anything that may lead you to injury.,1342310400,,548,4.228571428571429
2971789,4,B000WH5AX8,I really enjoy this on the days between my gym workouts. It stretches and the dancing is fun. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a fun cardio video that uses your own body against you. :),1342051200,,195,4.157894736842105
2971790,2,B000WH5AX8,You need space to dance and jump around. Good for a single person living alone. I recommend a yoga video or other workout video.,1341360000,,128,4.375
2971791,5,B000WH5AX8,"This is a nice set of cardio workouts. What's really great about this DVD is you get the genuine feel for Bollywood with playful and fun moves. Hemalayaa has included more of them in this than in some of her other DVDs. I'd rate this as the best of all the DVDs of hers I've purchased because you get more real Bollywood flavor.

There are three workouts that include a lot of high-impact moves. Although Hemalayaa does occasionally remind you to stay with lower-impact if you aren't comfortable, there is no demonstration of modified moves, so you'll have to figure them out yourself unless you can stick with the high-impact version. But Bollywood is bouncy and high-impact, so I guess it's worth it to see the real thing.

Besides three workouts, you get an extra Bollywood dance demonstration that's fun and cute. Hemalayaa is wearing the blue outfit she wears on the cover and the two other performers are wearing Indian garb. It's really the best part of the DVD. You get to see just how playful Bollywood dance really is.

What I really like about the Bollywood films I've seen is they portray more traditional Indian values. The main characters usually never kiss until they are married and the dance numbers are much more playful than the suggestive ones Hollywood puts out. Romance is a whole lot more fun when it's portrayed like that... traditional love and marriage. The first Bollywood movie I saw was Bride and Prejudice (a charming remake of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice). This DVD reminded me of that.

I really wish Hemalayaa would include dance numbers like this in all of her DVDs. This one was totally cute! I must have watched it at least eight times.",1337385600,3,1678,4.716723549488054
2971792,4,B000WH5AX8,"I recently started doing 30 minutes of dance workout videos in the mornings and wanted to find something new to extend my selection.  I found this and thought ""why not""?  I purchased it via instant video and gave it a shot and loved it!  I am a pretty picky with workout videos and was left fairly satisfied with the change of pace this workout video gave me.

Pros:
~It was a fun change to my usual dance workout videos.
~It really does change your body if you do it every day (I've lost 2 centimeters off my belly in the last week and half and my legs look more toned than before).
~I've noticed interval-like patterns in this video; She does a couple minutes of intense jumping and dancing, and then lets you catch your breath for a minute while taking you into a stretch followed by more high intensity moves.  Intervals are supposed to be amazing for burning fat, so this is a definite plus in this video, even if it isn't intentional.
~The moves in this workout are high-impact which is great for improving your cardiovascular health (among other things).
~It totally beats doing boring gym routines!!!

Cons:
~The music could have been a little louder.  This is one of my dance workout pet peeves, when the instructor's voice covers up the music.  How am I supposed to get my groove on if I can't hear the music very well?
~I would not suggest this workout for people with plantar fasciitis.  I have collapsing arches and my feet were killing me just after the first segment.  I have adapted by doing the workout barefoot on a thick exercise mat, which has cut down the pain significantly.
~The instructor is a bit distracted during the voice over.  The dance routine itself is executed with precision, but the voiceover seems discombobulated and at times confusing.  It is difficult to follow the first couple times because of the lack of clarity in her instructions, however, after doing it a couple of times you should get the hang of it just fine.  It is afterall, about having fun while working out, not about being a great dancer.

It looks like there are more cons, but I assure you, unless you have plantar fasciitis or are highly irritable when it comes to random giggling from your workout instructor, then I would recommend this workout video.  It is a fun change of pace, and gets you sweating without actually feeling like you are working out.",1332115200,,2363,4.57957244655582
2971793,2,B000WH5AX8,"I love the music and dance sequences in Bollywood films, and so I figured a DVD with that same spirit and moves would be a fun change of pace.  I usually workout with Jillian Michaels' DVD's, and I checked this one out from the library to alternate with those.  Mostly I will say that this video is annoying.  Hemalayaa does a voiceover explaining the movies, and she often breaks into giggling for no reason.  Her cuing isn't very helpful or timed well, especially when you're not in a position where you can keep your eye on the television.  Finally, I didn't even break a sweat.  It's just not that challenging and doesn't have much variety in moves.  I'm glad that I didn't buy this one years ago when I saw it for sale and it was new.

2971796,5,B000WH5AX8,"Bollywood dancing, in my opinion, is the top 3 best workout you can do.  You work your body from head to toe and you learn cultural indian dancing at the same time.  Can't get no better than that.",1297728000,,196,4.131578947368421
2971807,3,B000WH5AX8,"Be careful doing this workout! After a month of doing it regularly, my knees and calves were really suffering. Luckily, my husband told me how to align my joints differently so that I could continue without injuring myself (he studied martial arts for 20 years). But THERE IS NO HELP FOR YOUR BODY ALIGNMENT FROM HEMALAYAA!! There is almost no teaching from her at all. ""Bend your knees, if you need"" is the sum total of her advice. This is my major criticism for this DVD! I have done Pilates and running for three years with no injuries, and this workout nearly had me in trouble, because you can only get so far without help on proper posture, muscle use, breathing, etc. And moves like these dance moves involving prologed use of the same muscle groups have to be done properly or you will just strain yourself. Even since I have corrected my alignment, and have no more pain, I find that the overall effect of the workout is to make me feel tired, and somewhat drained. It is not well-planned exercise, such as Tai Chi or STOTT Pilates, that leaves you feeling better off (even if tired) than when you started. This video is fun for the music, pretty clothing, and bouncy moves, and it will get your heart-rate up, but I would not recommend it as a body-toning exercise (I had better results with toned behind, arms and belly after one week of Pilates and light jogging, than after a month of this video)or even as a healthy heart workout, because the moves are not planned carefully enough to give you an envigorating warm-up or VERY IMPORTANT cool-down.

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because if you are not careful, or you don't modify some of the moves it can be really hard on your joints because it is high impact aerobics.  I can't do all of the jumping in the video because of my back (and my weight), but you still get an awesome workout if you modify to a plie pulse.  I have been using the video for almost a month and everyone is telling me I look slimmer.  It gets you results and you don't feel bored.  I can't wait to get her other DVD's.  They say to switch up your workout every 3 months, and with her that is easy!  She is my fav and shows working out at home DOES work.  Also if you are pressed for time, or the workout is too heavy for you, I suggest just starting out with one of her workouts (there are 3 15 min ones).

2971815,4,B000WH5AX8,"I tend to get bored easily when I work out, and this DVD certainly kept me entertained.  It is a decent workout if you do segments 2 and 3, and a good workout if you do all three segments.  The dance moves are broken down so that anyone can do them, but if you have any dance experience at all, or any experience watching tons of Bollywood movies, you are likely to be able to pick this up very quickly and do the workout with the music on and the voice off.  Although Hemalaaya has quite a pleasant voice, it's much more fun to do the workout with just the music.

The only reason I did not give this DVD a perfect score is that the music could have been a lot catchier.  However, if you're willing to overlook that, not only will you burn the calories and improve your cardiovascular health, you could even pick up a few smooth moves for the dance floor!",1253059200,,856,4.163636363636364

Hemalayaa targets muscles that a lot of my dance workouts don't target, and she's such fun to workout with as well.  Laughing and smiling the whole time really helps you get into the workout and burn more calories.  I look forward to buying more of Hemalayaa's dvds.",1248912000,,348,4.40625
2971837,5,B000WH5AX8,"This DVD is so much fun and also the great thing about it is that it's divided into three 15 minute workouts. Each one is complete in itself, but you can also do all three together if you want. It gets your heart rate up, but in such a fun dancing way. You do have to be able to follow along well, though...you need to be a pretty good learner to watch their feet and keep up. Also, there is jumping involved, so for someone who has knee problems, it might bother you. Otherwise, you won't regret buying this!",1246665600,,509,4.151515151515151
2971838,4,B000WH5AX8,"I bought this after buying Hemalayaa's Bollywood Dance Workout.  I'll freely admit I am way, WAY out of shape and am just re-starting an exercise program.  I prefer to alternate my workout videos because doing the same one over and over and over gets boring to me, and when I'm bored, forget the workout.  Yesterday was Dance Workout day.  I got in just over 10 minutes (like I said...WAY out of shape).  Today was Bollywood Burn day.  6 minutes, 42 seconds, and I was done.  As other reviewers have noted, this workout could be called ""Thighs of Steel.""  Much more physically intense than Dance Workout.  And it's a small thing, but I prefer the set of Dance Workout better.  It's much more colorful, and I feel like I'm in somebody's living room with lots of Indian decor.  Bollywood Burn is just set on a very bland, monochromatic stage, so I feel like I'm in a gym.  Ugh.  On the whole, though, I recommend this.  Not much visual appeal set-wise, but fun music, relatively uncomplicated moves that can be adjusted for various physical needs (bad knees, etc), and good voiceover.",1245801600,,1082,4.656084656084656

It is great if you want to try something different or if you are getting bored with the same workout routines.  I have only tried the first segment and didn't find it all that challenging. I am not exactly a workout buff, actually I am quite the opposite. This video is great for a beginner working out or perhaps like a said someone who is bored with just the same moves. I think the direction given is good and the moves are fun to do.",1240358400,,511,4.268041237113402
2971841,5,B000WH5AX8,"I loved this video!

After doing another exercise video, I decided to create for myself a diverse exercise plan which included aerobics, palates, yoga, belly dance and Indian dance. I get easily bored with the same routine, so I thought by creating my own variety at home, I will have better results with continuing to exercise regularly.

For someone who has not exercised regularly for almost three years, and is 100 pounds overweight, I was pleased to see that I was able to get through the entire video without taking breaks.

I have done power yoga in the past on regular basis, so the yoga moves were a familiar and welcome addition.

I sweated a lot, and felt that the routine was fun, engaging and well paced.

I loved the narration as it was not screaming, but lighthearted and made me laugh a few times.

I am looking forward to doing this exercise video again.",1236470400,,871,4.587096774193548
2971842,4,B000WH5AX8,"This is a great work out. The 15 minute increments make it easy to do as much as you have time for and work up a sweat! Highly recomend it, lots of fun and Himalayaa is so cute!",1227484800,,177,3.6842105263157894
2971843,3,B000WH5AX8,"The first thing I notice is Hemalayaa's voice over.  I wish I could say that it was likeable, but I find her style of narration rather annoying; something in her intonation and giggling rubs me the wrong way.  It's not necessarily in sync with the video and doesn't cue very well; often it's not until she and the other dancers are doing the move that the narration identifies the change.

The workouts themselves are not necessarily well-paced.  The workouts go from bouncy dancing to yoga, then back to bouncy dancing.  This is also most assuredly NOT low-impact, so it's impossible to recommend for people with joint problems.  (It doesn't purport itself to be low-impact, at least, though neither does any preview or packing information present just how non-low-impact it is.)  That being said, the workouts also are rather a lot of fun, silly if not sexy, which goes a long way to redeem this particular video.

Overall, I enjoyed this video the few times I did it, but finally had to set it aside when all the hopping got to be too much for me.  I can't speak for its Bollywood authenticity, but it can still be a fun addition to the library of someone with excellent knees.",1224028800,9,1180,4.634615384615385
2971844,1,B000WH5AX8,"I wanted to like this exercise, but sadly, I did not. The problem about it for me is the jumping, it was too much, and not because I have bad knees or anything, it was just not fun at all to be jumping around.  I thought this was going to be an entertaining bollywood type of dance.  Another thing, afterwards I did not feel any burn, I did sweat a bit, but not burning the next day.  I need something more challenging, but overall it was not fun.  PS: the voice over was annoying too.",1223424000,2,485,4.073684210526316
2971845,5,B000WH5AX8,"Another workout which goes fast and leaves you feeling healthily tired. The stretching is integrated with the moves so if you don't like Yoga or stretching, this makes you do it anyway and get the benefit. The impacts on the knee and bare feet are conscientiously minimized by Hemalayaa with admonitions.

Also, this dance tradition is more ""earthy"" than Western classical ballet in which the goal, noble enough in its own way, is to ""leap and pause"" like Baryshnikov: to leave the earth. Whereas here you start by touching the earth to ask its blessing, and the result is it doesn't hurt you. It's a mystery.

You learn great moves and gestures with which to amuse your friends notably the ""lightbulb"" with a really cheesey smile that makes you feel like a film poster.

Also, there's a bloke in this one which provides reassurance to blokes as to whether these are for blokes as well as the hairies, the glamouries...the ladies, that is.

Only problem at this time for me is that this is a 45 minute workout. I track workouts in integer blocks of ten minutes and wonder whether I should round up or down.",1219276800,2,1106,4.627551020408164
2971846,1,B000WH5AX8,"Hemalayaa is beautiful to watch and the workouts use a well constructed arch of warm up, burn, cool down. The first time I used this DVD I enjoyed it, broke a sweat, and definitely burned. After that the production problems of the DVD turned me off. In the first section the movements are not in time with the music, making the workout very difficult. Throughout all three sections Hemalayaa's movements are often ahead of or out of synch with her verbal instruction. Other times she is doing something entirely different than the other two people in the video. This last point is a matter of taste, but I felt a little like a vaudevillian Ali Baba during some of the choreographies, or perhaps an Arabian line dancer. The light bulb? Really? Will that give me shapely wrists, 'cause I've been worried mine aren't svelte enough! My biggest problem with this DVD is that it was horrible for my knees. I have reasonable library of DVD workouts and this is the only one that hurts to use.  Not the muscle burn you want, but an actual damage to joint type pain.

I was looking for more of an Indian dance routine/workout like I saw on Fittv with Instructor Sarina Jina.  This DVD combines several Indian dance moves with crisscross jumping jacks, half jacks, squats...  However, the workouts were difficult to keep pace with because the instructional part was poorly done, there were no countdowns on the crisscross jumping jacks, half jacks, hop turns and jumps making it difficult to distinguish when to perform the next routine/move.  I've been playing the Workout II without the instructional part, just the music and attempting to figure out the moves sequences on my own.",1215993600,4,687,5.0

Instead, there comes Hemalayaa, a beautiful woman, very fit, but which lacks the grace of a real Indian dancer and all you do I guess is ordinary aerobics with some type of weird techno wannabe Indian music. Please... do yourself a favor, if you are looking for a Bollywood workout thinking you will be dancing like Karina Kapoor or Kajol... THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT. Go  get Bollyrobics with Julia Casper.

2971860,3,B000WH5AX8,"This is a fun video, but it moves very fast and doesn't give you enough time to learn some of the moves. I also had a problem with the pacing -- in the middle of an intense, high-impact cardio workout you suddenly stop and do yoga, then you suddenly start dancing again. I would prefer the workout more thoughfully designed, building up to the more difficult stuff, and having the yoga be a separate workout. There is a LOT of jumping involved, which is really bad for your knees. There should be alternate moves for people who prefer not to jump. Also, the instructions are good but could use a little more attention to detail -- for example, if you are bending forward and can't see the screen, there should be a little more instruction so you know to get up and start moving again. Finally, the outfits are fun (though hardly workout clothes) but I was a little confused at all the zooming in on the butt... this is an exercise video, people, not a music video.",1209859200,12,964,4.421348314606742

I did all three of the segments at once and really felt like I got a great workout, and it was so much fun!  The moves aren't so complicated that you couldn't get them down after one or two tries - I'm not even that coordinated, and I was able to keep up with almost all of the moves my first time through.

The only downside is that since the workout is broken down into three 15 minute segments, you get a warm-up and cool-down with each, so it cuts down on the length of the cardio, but it's such a fun workout that I don't mind.  I will definitely use this one over and over!",1206403200,5,684,3.9635036496350367

the title is not kidding when it says ""burn"" because there is a lot of bouncing involved. The moves take a lot of concentration as they require much coordination and you will feel very worked at the end of it.
There is much stretching so that you won't become sore. Every few minutes they lead you through a short period of stretches to workout mostly ankles and feet and shins because that is the bouncing areas.

It's easy to be happy with this DVD. We both worked up a sweat doing the shimmy and steppin' high with Hemalayaa. She's very upbeat and lighthearted, which kept us both engaged and relaxed. Laughing a lot makes it easier to not overfocus on our mistakes and lack of coordination. And right now, I'm pretty uncoordinated, believe me.

I had to modify some of the jumps and hops, but I've gotten used to that since I hurt my knee last year. It was great to have a man in the video and I noticed his moves were a little more subtle and solid, which gave my guy and I permission to not overdo it. But we still got a workout!

The best part? I put it on again a couple of days later and my partner got up from his desk (!) and came over on his own to hop around with me. No nagging required. Yaaayyy!!!

Setting:  Theatre stage with teacher and two dancers, 1 woman and 1 guy.  This time the backup dancers are quite good and look like they are enjoying the choreography.

workout:  the dvd is divided into 3 workouts, each with its own warm-up, learn the steps, routine and cool down. The cool down is brief for segments 1 &2 in the event you want to do segment 3.  The steps are easy and fun.  BE WARNED, MANY OF THE STEPS ARE HIGH IMPACT.  I have bad knees and I had to modify the criss cross jumping jacks, half jacks, hop turns and jumps.  No modifications are shown on the video.  However, I am aerobically out of shape and I still got my heart rate up doing low impact.

Music:  This is bhangra hip hop music. The music is different for each segment. The teacher is in voice over and she is much louder than the music.  There is a music only option and when you hear it without her talking, it is quite good and rhythmic.

Overall:  A good workout that is edited and choreographed much better than her bollywood workout dvd. There is also a free dance special feature with the 3 dancers clowning around.  Next time I do this, I will use the music only option as it is pretty easy to visually follow. the production quality is very good and the steps are in beat with the music.

While these routines are built up from basic moves, making it fairly easy to follow, good luck keeping up if you don't have excellent knees or a handy trampoline nearby.  These workouts are challenging and will burn a lot of calories if you can stick with them!  The problem is that it's rather boring to watch--just three dancers on a stage with a white background and the music gets repetitive after awhile.  I found myself thinking that actually just going for a jog would be an easier way to get in some cardio.",1408492800,,635,4.543859649122807
3206260,5,B000WH5AX8,"I am most certainly NOT in shape right now, but I love Bollywood movies, and I love the idea of dancing for fitness.  One original concern I had about this video was whether or not the instructions would be in English -- whew!  They are.  That's the first plus for me.  As much as I like Hindi language films, I don't speak Hindi or exercise to it.

My second concern was whether I would be able to do it.  Not only am I not fit, but I am also not a dancer.  Well, I'm pleased to say that I can keep up.  Hemalayaa starts out slow and repetitive and then she takes the moves we've learned and puts them into choreography.  It really is fun and easy enough to keep up with, although I'm hoping to keep getting more polished as I continue working with this video.

The third thing I especially like about this workout is that it's divided into three portions.  Since I'm just starting,  I'm doing one section per day.  I don't remember how long the last section is, but the first two are each about sixteen minutes long.  That's just perfect for where I am right now, and I am hoping to eventually gain strength and endurance enough to do the whole thing at once.

Finally, besides being fun dance moves, these exercises really work the whole body.  Hemalayaa states that we'll be working the thighs and buttocks, but I feel the burn all over.  As we are doing knee bends or lunges, for example, we are also doing arm movements and twisting the torso.  It feels good all over.

Incidentally, I also have arthritis, and so far the movements haven't felt damaging to my joints.  Of course, I really haven't taken the exercise to full energy yet or done as much jumping as Hemalayaa does, either.  She continually encourages the participant to do only what feels right, and she offers suggestions for alternative movements for those who can't do all of the choreography.  I really love this video, and I'm hoping not only to lose weight and get toned, but also to learn the full routine and someday perform it for my husband.  It gives me something to look forward to.  :)",1402444800,6,2067,4.4217506631299734

I especially don't understand the worthless foot twists, bows to the floor, etc....and suspect Hemalayaa is mostly using these as an opportunity for hair flips.  In short, don't waste your money (that's what you're doing, if you're actually buying this with the idea that it is about fitness).  The CRUNCH videos are easily as fun, and manage to get your heart rate up and keep it there, if only for 20 minutes or so.",1351296000,,826,4.421052631578948
3206283,1,B000WH5AX8,"I LOVED Hemalayaa's workouts on my On Demand Fitness channel, so I bought this video. Even though other people warned me about the poor choreography, the strange timing and the terrible hopping in place--which, the way she does it, is very very bad for your tendons and knees--I thought they were just overcritical and negative.
But they were not being overcritical.
I have been dancing my whole life for joy and exercise and I have never had any issues with my knees or ankles. This video gave me issues immediately. When I showed the moves to my doctor, she freaked out.
The entire middle section consists of jumping and hopping around in place.

Please be careful. Though I have truly valued her very loving and terrifically fun other workouts--I warn you not to buy this one!",1350691200,11,779,4.727941176470588
3206284,4,B000WH5AX8,"I enjoyed the video. The dances were appropriately challenging for a novice who is in generally good shape. Hemalayaa is charming too. The reason I didn't love it is that there was no culmination of the instruction in a final complete dance, and the music wasn't as exciting as it could have been.",1349827200,,297,4.622641509433962
3206285,3,B000WH5AX8,This is a fun workout than will have you sweating immediately! The music is great and the teacher gives good instruction and the pace is just right. If your a larger person like myself you may find some of the dance moves and the jumping around to be hard on your knees. I would be careful doing this video and maybe just glaze over those parts until your physically ready. Some of the thing she does in the video can be dangerous for a person carrying a lot of excess weight. Find your own limits and don't do anything that may lead you to injury.,1342310400,,548,4.228571428571429

3206287,2,B000WH5AX8,You need space to dance and jump around. Good for a single person living alone. I recommend a yoga video or other workout video.,1341360000,,128,4.375
3206288,5,B000WH5AX8,"This is a nice set of cardio workouts. What's really great about this DVD is you get the genuine feel for Bollywood with playful and fun moves. Hemalayaa has included more of them in this than in some of her other DVDs. I'd rate this as the best of all the DVDs of hers I've purchased because you get more real Bollywood flavor.

There are three workouts that include a lot of high-impact moves. Although Hemalayaa does occasionally remind you to stay with lower-impact if you aren't comfortable, there is no demonstration of modified moves, so you'll have to figure them out yourself unless you can stick with the high-impact version. But Bollywood is bouncy and high-impact, so I guess it's worth it to see the real thing.

Besides three workouts, you get an extra Bollywood dance demonstration that's fun and cute. Hemalayaa is wearing the blue outfit she wears on the cover and the two other performers are wearing Indian garb. It's really the best part of the DVD. You get to see just how playful Bollywood dance really is.

What I really like about the Bollywood films I've seen is they portray more traditional Indian values. The main characters usually never kiss until they are married and the dance numbers are much more playful than the suggestive ones Hollywood puts out. Romance is a whole lot more fun when it's portrayed like that... traditional love and marriage. The first Bollywood movie I saw was Bride and Prejudice (a charming remake of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice). This DVD reminded me of that.

I really wish Hemalayaa would include dance numbers like this in all of her DVDs. This one was totally cute! I must have watched it at least eight times.",1337385600,3,1678,4.716723549488054
3206289,4,B000WH5AX8,"I recently started doing 30 minutes of dance workout videos in the mornings and wanted to find something new to extend my selection.  I found this and thought ""why not""?  I purchased it via instant video and gave it a shot and loved it!  I am a pretty picky with workout videos and was left fairly satisfied with the change of pace this workout video gave me.

Pros:
~It was a fun change to my usual dance workout videos.
~It really does change your body if you do it every day (I've lost 2 centimeters off my belly in the last week and half and my legs look more toned than before).
~I've noticed interval-like patterns in this video; She does a couple minutes of intense jumping and dancing, and then lets you catch your breath for a minute while taking you into a stretch followed by more high intensity moves.  Intervals are supposed to be amazing for burning fat, so this is a definite plus in this video, even if it isn't intentional.
~The moves in this workout are high-impact which is great for improving your cardiovascular health (among other things).
~It totally beats doing boring gym routines!!!

Cons:
~The music could have been a little louder.  This is one of my dance workout pet peeves, when the instructor's voice covers up the music.  How am I supposed to get my groove on if I can't hear the music very well?
~I would not suggest this workout for people with plantar fasciitis.  I have collapsing arches and my feet were killing me just after the first segment.  I have adapted by doing the workout barefoot on a thick exercise mat, which has cut down the pain significantly.
~The instructor is a bit distracted during the voice over.  The dance routine itself is executed with precision, but the voiceover seems discombobulated and at times confusing.  It is difficult to follow the first couple times because of the lack of clarity in her instructions, however, after doing it a couple of times you should get the hang of it just fine.  It is afterall, about having fun while working out, not about being a great dancer.

It looks like there are more cons, but I assure you, unless you have plantar fasciitis or are highly irritable when it comes to random giggling from your workout instructor, then I would recommend this workout video.  It is a fun change of pace, and gets you sweating without actually feeling like you are working out.",1332115200,,2363,4.57957244655582
3206290,2,B000WH5AX8,"I love the music and dance sequences in Bollywood films, and so I figured a DVD with that same spirit and moves would be a fun change of pace.  I usually workout with Jillian Michaels' DVD's, and I checked this one out from the library to alternate with those.  Mostly I will say that this video is annoying.  Hemalayaa does a voiceover explaining the movies, and she often breaks into giggling for no reason.  Her cuing isn't very helpful or timed well, especially when you're not in a position where you can keep your eye on the television.  Finally, I didn't even break a sweat.  It's just not that challenging and doesn't have much variety in moves.  I'm glad that I didn't buy this one years ago when I saw it for sale and it was new.  I'm taking it back to the library today.",1330646400,,781,4.337931034482758

3206292,5,B000WH5AX8,So happy I rented this. I had so much fun with this workout that the time just flew by. I love to dance so this is the perfect way to get my daily cardio workout in. It is so nice that even if you only have 15 minutes you can work up a sweat and as a mom of a 3 year old I need that flexibility.  Hemalayaa has a fun and engaging teaching style. I can't wait to try more of her workouts.,1325980800,,387,3.607142857142857
3206293,5,B000WH5AX8,"Bollywood dancing, in my opinion, is the top 3 best workout you can do.  You work your body from head to toe and you learn cultural indian dancing at the same time.  Can't get no better than that.",1297728000,,196,4.131578947368421
3206304,3,B000WH5AX8,"Be careful doing this workout! After a month of doing it regularly, my knees and calves were really suffering. Luckily, my husband told me how to align my joints differently so that I could continue without injuring myself (he studied martial arts for 20 years). But THERE IS NO HELP FOR YOUR BODY ALIGNMENT FROM HEMALAYAA!! There is almost no teaching from her at all. ""Bend your knees, if you need"" is the sum total of her advice. This is my major criticism for this DVD! I have done Pilates and running for three years with no injuries, and this workout nearly had me in trouble, because you can only get so far without help on proper posture, muscle use, breathing, etc. And moves like these dance moves involving prologed use of the same muscle groups have to be done properly or you will just strain yourself. Even since I have corrected my alignment, and have no more pain, I find that the overall effect of the workout is to make me feel tired, and somewhat drained. It is not well-planned exercise, such as Tai Chi or STOTT Pilates, that leaves you feeling better off (even if tired) than when you started. This video is fun for the music, pretty clothing, and bouncy moves, and it will get your heart-rate up, but I would not recommend it as a body-toning exercise (I had better results with toned behind, arms and belly after one week of Pilates and light jogging, than after a month of this video)or even as a healthy heart workout, because the moves are not planned carefully enough to give you an envigorating warm-up or VERY IMPORTANT cool-down. Limited expertise on the part of the video creators, in my opinion! Proceed with caution if you purchase this!",1296950400,,1671,4.591973244147157

The workout is done on a stage with pleasant colors and setup. The background music and non-intrusive. I found it easier to follow the backup dancers because Hemalayaa can be too fast and ""hoppy."" At times there's no clear explanation of the move and she just jumps into moves quickly. The second workout is fast paced and more at an intermediate level but still lot of fun. Overall she does a great job of combining yoga, stretching, dancing, cardio fitness into one fun workout.",1276128000,2,623,4.621621621621622

3206310,4,B000WH5AX8,"This exercise video is totally addictive and fun.  I have to say it is the best workout I have ever done!  It will make you sweat!  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because if you are not careful, or you don't modify some of the moves it can be really hard on your joints because it is high impact aerobics.  I can't do all of the jumping in the video because of my back (and my weight), but you still get an awesome workout if you modify to a plie pulse.  I have been using the video for almost a month and everyone is telling me I look slimmer.  It gets you results and you don't feel bored.  I can't wait to get her other DVD's.  They say to switch up your workout every 3 months, and with her that is easy!  She is my fav and shows working out at home DOES work.  Also if you are pressed for time, or the workout is too heavy for you, I suggest just starting out with one of her workouts (there are 3 15 min ones).  Listen to your body and take it at your own pase!",1254096000,2,990,3.8275862068965516

But I did the whole tape and really didn't feel to woren out...I think its because we don't really do extended cardio work outs, she's always stopping to stretch. Well maybe if I do a strength work out before this one it help tire me out, and help make me sore the next morning! If you are a beginner I'm sure it will make you sweat!",1253232000,,383,3.987012987012987
3206312,4,B000WH5AX8,"I tend to get bored easily when I work out, and this DVD certainly kept me entertained.  It is a decent workout if you do segments 2 and 3, and a good workout if you do all three segments.  The dance moves are broken down so that anyone can do them, but if you have any dance experience at all, or any experience watching tons of Bollywood movies, you are likely to be able to pick this up very quickly and do the workout with the music on and the voice off.  Although Hemalaaya has quite a pleasant voice, it's much more fun to do the workout with just the music.

The only reason I did not give this DVD a perfect score is that the music could have been a lot catchier.  However, if you're willing to overlook that, not only will you burn the calories and improve your cardiovascular health, you could even pick up a few smooth moves for the dance floor!",1253059200,,856,4.163636363636364

Hemalayaa targets muscles that a lot of my dance workouts don't target, and she's such fun to workout with as well.

Each one is complete in itself, but you can also do all three together if you want. It gets your heart rate up, but in such a fun dancing way. You do have to be able to follow along well, though...you need to be a pretty good learner to watch their feet and keep up. Also, there is jumping involved, so for someone who has knee problems, it might bother you. Otherwise, you won't regret buying this!",1246665600,,509,4.151515151515151
3206335,4,B000WH5AX8,"I bought this after buying Hemalayaa's Bollywood Dance Workout.  I'll freely admit I am way, WAY out of shape and am just re-starting an exercise program.  I prefer to alternate my workout videos because doing the same one over and over and over gets boring to me, and when I'm bored, forget the workout.  Yesterday was Dance Workout day.  I got in just over 10 minutes (like I said...WAY out of shape).  Today was Bollywood Burn day.  6 minutes, 42 seconds, and I was done.  As other reviewers have noted, this workout could be called ""Thighs of Steel.""  Much more physically intense than Dance Workout.  And it's a small thing, but I prefer the set of Dance Workout better.  It's much more colorful, and I feel like I'm in somebody's living room with lots of Indian decor.  Bollywood Burn is just set on a very bland, monochromatic stage, so I feel like I'm in a gym.  Ugh.  On the whole, though, I recommend this.  Not much visual appeal set-wise, but fun music, relatively uncomplicated moves that can be adjusted for various physical needs (bad knees, etc), and good voiceover.",1245801600,,1082,4.656084656084656

It is great if you want to try something different or if you are getting bored with the same workout routines.  I have only tried the first segment and didn't find it all that challenging. I am not exactly a workout buff, actually I am quite the opposite. This video is great for a beginner working out or perhaps like a said someone who is bored with just the same moves. I think the direction given is good and the moves are fun to do.",1240358400,,511,4.268041237113402

After doing another exercise video, I decided to create for myself a diverse exercise plan which included aerobics, palates, yoga, belly dance and Indian dance. I get easily bored with the same routine, so I thought by creating my own variety at home, I will have better results with continuing to exercise regularly.

For someone who has not exercised regularly for almost three years, and is 100 pounds overweight, I was pleased to see that I was able to get through the entire video without taking breaks.

I have done power yoga in the past on regular basis, so the yoga moves were a familiar and welcome addition.

I sweated a lot, and felt that the routine was fun, engaging and well paced.

I loved the narration as it was not screaming, but lighthearted and made me laugh a few times.

I am looking forward to doing this exercise video again.",1236470400,,871,4.587096774193548

3206340,3,B000WH5AX8,"The first thing I notice is Hemalayaa's voice over.  I wish I could say that it was likeable, but I find her style of narration rather annoying; something in her intonation and giggling rubs me the wrong way.  It's not necessarily in sync with the video and doesn't cue very well; often it's not until she and the other dancers are doing the move that the narration identifies the change.

The workouts themselves are not necessarily well-paced.  The workouts go from bouncy dancing to yoga, then back to bouncy dancing.  This is also most assuredly NOT low-impact, so it's impossible to recommend for people with joint problems.  (It doesn't purport itself to be low-impact, at least, though neither does any preview or packing information present just how non-low-impact it is.)  That being said, the workouts also are rather a lot of fun, silly if not sexy, which goes a long way to redeem this particular video.

Overall, I enjoyed this video the few times I did it, but finally had to set it aside when all the hopping got to be too much for me.  I can't speak for its Bollywood authenticity, but it can still be a fun addition to the library of someone with excellent knees.",1224028800,9,1180,4.634615384615385
3206341,1,B000WH5AX8,"I wanted to like this exercise, but sadly, I did not. The problem about it for me is the jumping, it was too much, and not because I have bad knees or anything, it was just not fun at all to be jumping around.  I thought this was going to be an entertaining bollywood type of dance.  Another thing, afterwards I did not feel any burn, I did sweat a bit, but not burning the next day.  I need something more challenging, but overall it was not fun.  PS: the voice over was annoying too.",1223424000,2,485,4.073684210526316
3206342,5,B000WH5AX8,"Another workout which goes fast and leaves you feeling healthily tired. The stretching is integrated with the moves so if you don't like Yoga or stretching, this makes you do it anyway and get the benefit. The impacts on the knee and bare feet are conscientiously minimized by Hemalayaa with admonitions.

Also, this dance tradition is more ""earthy"" than Western classical ballet in which the goal, noble enough in its own way, is to ""leap and pause"" like Baryshnikov: to leave the earth. Whereas here you start by touching the earth to ask its blessing, and the result is it doesn't hurt you. It's a mystery.

You learn great moves and gestures with which to amuse your friends notably the ""lightbulb"" with a really cheesey smile that makes you feel like a film poster.

Also, there's a bloke in this one which provides reassurance to blokes as to whether these are for blokes as well as the hairies, the glamouries...the ladies, that is.

Only problem at this time for me is that this is a 45 minute workout. I track workouts in integer blocks of ten minutes and wonder whether I should round up or down.",1219276800,2,1106,4.627551020408164

The first time I used this DVD I enjoyed it, broke a sweat, and definitely burned. After that the production problems of the DVD turned me off. In the first section the movements are not in time with the music, making the workout very difficult. Throughout all three sections Hemalayaa's movements are often ahead of or out of synch with her verbal instruction. Other times she is doing something entirely different than the other two people in the video. This last point is a matter of taste, but I felt a little like a vaudevillian Ali Baba during some of the choreographies, or perhaps an Arabian line dancer. The light bulb? Really? Will that give me shapely wrists, 'cause I've been worried mine aren't svelte enough! My biggest problem with this DVD is that it was horrible for my knees. I have reasonable library of DVD workouts and this is the only one that hurts to use.  Not the muscle burn you want, but an actual damage to joint type pain.

This DVD combines several Indian dance moves with crisscross jumping jacks, half jacks, squats...  However, the workouts were difficult to keep pace with because the instructional part was poorly done, there were no countdowns on the crisscross jumping jacks, half jacks, hop turns and jumps making it difficult to distinguish when to perform the next routine/move.

I would prefer the workout more thoughfully designed, building up to the more difficult stuff, and having the yoga be a separate workout. There is a LOT of jumping involved, which is really bad for your knees. There should be alternate moves for people who prefer not to jump. Also, the instructions are good but could use a little more attention to detail -- for example, if you are bending forward and can't see the screen, there should be a little more instruction so you know to get up and start moving again. Finally, the outfits are fun (though hardly workout clothes) but I was a little confused at all the zooming in on the butt... this is an exercise video, people, not a music video.",1209859200,12,964,4.421348314606742

The moves aren't so complicated that you couldn't get them down after one or two tries - I'm not even that coordinated, and I was able to keep up with almost all of the moves my first time through.

The only downside is that since the workout is broken down into three 15 minute segments, you get a warm-up and cool-down with each, so it cuts down on the length of the cardio, but it's such a fun workout that I don't mind.

3206362,4,B000WH5AX8,This might just be one of the most difficult workout DVDs I have ever done. A girl at work mentioned that she had tried it and loved it so I checked it out. She warned me that her legs were burning after she did the workout but that was the understatement of the century. About 3 minutes into this workout you already feel like your thighs are on fire. This should be called Bollywood Thighs of Steel!  Don't let the fact that this is a dance video fool you. Its serious stuff! Definitely not for anyone for who has bad knees.,1202428800,27,526,4.207920792079208
3206363,5,B000WH5AX8,"I love all of Hemalayaa's videos.  She really inspires me to have fun while getting in shape.  I think this one is my favorite of the dance dvds, although I am happy to have them all.  I also really love Hemalayaa's Yoga For Young Bodies, even though mine is not so young, the yoga for couples is a nice feature.
Bottom line is everything Hemalayaa does is fun and it's a good workout.",1201478400,,385,4.2465753424657535
8223400,4,B000WH5AX8,"This is great as an easy day or as a rest day workout. If you are already doing any intermediate or higher level of cardio or strength training, none of these moves are going to leave you sore. This video gets your heart rate up, you'll sweat at least a little bit, and the time goes fast. The instruction isn't really on time with the movements, which is why this didn't get 5 stars, but it's still pretty easy to pick up (when I got lost, it was only for 4 or 5 seconds).",1500076800,,473,4.042553191489362
