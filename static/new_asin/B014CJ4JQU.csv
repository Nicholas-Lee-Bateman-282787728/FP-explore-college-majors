8730211,1,B014CJ4JQU,"Look closely at the DVD data and see that they tried to cram 444 minutes of documentary onto one single DVD. Poor quality disk skips, freezes, eventually refuses to play at all. Skip this one and get the 5-DVD set. Each disk has 3 50-minute episodes. Not only do the disks actually play, but several of the other installments are included that this disk has omitted. Costs more but worth it.",1504656000,,391,4.52112676056338
