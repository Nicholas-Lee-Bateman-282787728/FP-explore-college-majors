8021902,3,B000246MZG,"This film is sort of a curiousity as it was Stalin's favorite movie and he even sent a copy of it to Franklin Roosevelt.  For this reason, it's a nice one to have in a film collection.  However, while the VHS version may have subtitles, this DVD version does not.  The story of a town going to a music competition is not so complicated that it can't be followed, but it would be nice to know what they're saying.  The sound quality is uneven in parts of the film and the last few minutes looks like it was restored from a different negative as the picture quality is a little grainy.  The movie is entertaining, but subtitles would have made it better.",1297814400,,652,4.311475409836065
