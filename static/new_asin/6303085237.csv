I especially liked the portrayal of Dennis and Brian and Murray.

557968,3,6303085237,"I feel that this movie was not as good as ""An American Family"". Bruce Greenwood, although a good actor and good Dennis Wilson, did not have any resemblence to Dennis, whereas Nick Stabile did. I feel it does the movie better if the actor portraying someone resembles them a little bit, (I understand that may be hard to find but when you do the movie is better(: )It's been a while since i've seen either of these movies but I definately feel ""An American Family"" is a lot better. This movie is good, too, but if you a Dennis Wilson fan, then i would consider seeing ""An American Family"" b/c Nick Stabile portrays Dennis really well. Actually, I recommend seeing both so you can compare and decide for yourself. ***FOREWARNING: ""An American Family"" is really hard to find at a reasonable price***",1062288000,3,796,4.612676056338028

(--:  ) - I didn't know too much in the early 90's (when I first saw this thing) about the life of the early Beach Boys - I had heard that Brian Wilson had 'weirded out' somewhat.. so, this film, with its uncompromising look at the abusive, hard-driving father, Murray, hit me like a rock.. it also showed the troubled personality of a very unhappy Dennis Love and speculated on what might have led to his drowning.. the critics didn't like this presentation too much, and it's overshadowed by THE BEACH BOYS: AN AMERICAN FAMILY now, I suppose.. but, of the two, I still prefer ""Summer Dreams.""  it's shorter, and there's no candy-coated tribute words about Murray at the end either.  You will understand what Brian Wilson meant when he sang about needing sanctuary ""In My Room"".  With Wilson's recent beyond-belief performance at the Queen's Party in Britain, let's hope the dude is finally enjoying some peace of mind..",1045699200,5,1098,4.732984293193717

Now the mini serious takes a far better look at the Beach Boys from the start all there ups and downs and ins and outs you see the good beach boys and the druged out beach boys one thing i find weired in the movie is Murry Wilson hates rock & roll in the movie,but in the mini serious it shows Murry Wilson having no problem with rock & roll this i believe is or why would he have stuck out for long. So ive come to a conclusion the movie sucks and i cant belive what you people are asking for a collage of trash the mini serious costed me 17.99 and you get to see the whole real beach boys good or bad but the movie does have better actors and they look more like the beach boys than the actors in the mini serious this is my final conclusion..........",1406332800,,1173,4.017094017094017

558039,1,6303085237,"Note: this review was written by two people.

 This is a truly awful TV version of the Beach Boys Story. None of the actors even come close to capturing the real people they are playing, with the actor playing Carl Wilson being the absolute worst. With casting this poor I guess we should just be glad that Karen Lamm was not played by Moms Mabley. I mean seriously. there are hours and hours of footage of the real Beach Boys to study - didn't anyone bother to watch any of it? A lot of the costumes and make-up are also poorly done, even by low-budget TV movie standards. The long hair and big 70s beards look like cheap disguises that were stolen off the Halloween clearance rack at Wal-Mart. Brian's ""sideburns"" in one scene look more like Chia Pets in need of some pruning. Of course, We probably shouldn't put-down Chia Pets, as a Chia might have done a better job of fact-checking than the screenwriters of this movie. A whole lot of things are just factually wrong - from small details like the types of guitars used, to medium-sized gaffes like the order in which the Beach Boys biggest hits were released, to major offenses such as the way the death of Dennis Wilson is portrayed. In real life, Dennis's ""friends"" were drunk and didn't stop him from diving into the water, nor notice him missing, nor call the Coast Guard for hours. The way it's portrayed in this movie, everyone was so sober-minded and heroic that you almost expect the ""Baywatch"" theme to kick-in as David Hasslehoff runs down the beach to save the day. Also, the casting of Bruce Greenwood as Dennis seems ironic...Ironic because he seems to be playing someone other than Dennis Wilson. We also got quickly annoyed with the writers penchant for ""cutely"" dropping Beach Boys song titles and lyrics into people's conversations - after the first few We were thinking; ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" if this movie was over! For those of you who love trivia, it's interesting to note that for the video release of this film the tagline was changed from ""The Story of the Beach Boys"" to ""The Naked Truth About the Beach Boys"". This simply means that they added a few topless ladies that weren't seen in the TV broadcast. Sadly, the actors playing Carl & Brian are still the biggest boobs in the movie. All in all, This movie is to Beack Boys fans what the films of Ed Wood are to serious sci-fi buffs - something that is so bad it's fun to laugh-out-loud to once, but you probably wouldn't want to revisit too often.",1284076800,10,2481,4.535714285714286
558090,2,6303085237,"This is a terrible, exploitive movie.  Rent it on Netflix, it's not worth owning.",1278547200,3,81,4.785714285714286
558091,1,6303085237,"As a long-time Beach Boys fan, it saddens me to see this movie out in the public arena. It is not a worthy representation of the exceptionally gifted and talented Wilson family.

The acting is terrible... cringeworthy and painful to watch. My six year old can mime better than Greg Kean as acknowledged genius Brian Wilson. The dearth of credible acting results in glaringly inaccurate portrayals of Audrey as insipid and pathetic, Carl (whose voice remains unmatched in rock history except by the King himself) as whiny and gormless, and the rock-solid Al Jardine as almost invisible.

Arlen Dean Snyder is perhaps the standout in a rotten barrell, but his interpretation of Murry is devoid of sympathy and lacks humanity. Casey Sander is the only actor who actually looks like his character, Mike Love. The supporting characters pale into even further insignificance, with the unfortunate exception of Wendy Kaplan's retarded-clown performance. If I were Marilyn Wilson, I would have sued.

The starring role of the widely-adored Dennis Wilson, a deep and complex man in real life, is botched and wasted by an unchanging, uncharismatic Bruce Greenwood, trying vainly to substitute boppiness and cutesy-pie grins for Wilson's legendary energy and compelling presence.

The singing is little better. There is a rider at the start of the film about the music not being performed by the Beach Boys. Believe me, its quite superfluous to tell us that. We know within the first bar.

The film was based on Steven Gaines' book ""Heroes and Villains"" and that's probably where its multitudinous problems began. The book has never achieved credibility or respect, and the film certainly follows the same suit. At least the book was readable.",1260316800,7,1732,5.127659574468085

558093,3,6303085237,"A GREAT MURRAY WILSON > Arlen Dean Snyder. He should've been in the 2000 release ""The Beach Boys: An American Family"" as Murray and not in this cheesy re-make with a ""really short"" Brian Wilson. Kevin Dunn as Murray is okay in ""The Beach Boys: An American Family"" but Snyder ""is"" Murray Wilson.",1240704000,2,294,4.566037735849057
558094,3,6303085237,"I am a Beach Boys fan.  Let's get that out of the way first.  I have trouble being objective about them and their music.  I also have read, watched and studied many books, videos and articles about them over the last over 30 years.

So, for me this movies was a must see based on all of that.  And I kind of liked it.  It is more from Dennis Wilson's point of view (or at least the writers and producers version of that) and therefore some of the other Beach Boys get short shrift.  Also, the music is NOT the Beach Boys performing, however, it is pretty good ( I think former Beach Boys band member and current Brian Wilson Band member, Jeffrey Foskett had something to do with it).

As for the movie itself: it is dramatically at least a notch better than AN AMERICAN FAMILY, which suffers from classic ""Movie of the Week"" syndrome: campy overacting, some ridiculous conflation of parts of the history (this one has a lot of that also) and some stupid writing.  Truth is, I like both movies, God help me, because they tell the story, albeit very truncated and Hollywood versions of the story.

If you are a true Beach Boys fan, and like me some what obsessive-compulsive and need to have everything by or about the Beach Boys, you will probably want this, if only to have fun putting it down.  IF you are someone who does not know much about the Beach Boys and wants to know more, I would go for the documentary ENDLESS HARMONY instead.  It too has its bias and flaws, but it features the real Beach Boys talking about their music and their life (and each other!), as well as some great rare performances and recordings.

This is more of a dramatic ""shortcut"", that while not bad, is not great either.  It is entertaining though, and not expensive.",1221782400,6,1750,4.411214953271028
558095,4,6303085237,"When I purchased this DVD I was thinking this was the VH1 original movie that I saw years ago. It's not but it's not bad. The VH1 movie was better as it centered on Brian Wilson and his problems. This movie is centered on Dennis Wilson and his problems. As any Beach Boy fan knows, Brian was the genius behind the music. Dennis wasn't a real contributor to the music. He could barely play drums and wasn't much of a singer either.

The VH1 movie was also more about the music! It showed how Brian was inspired by Phil Spector's Wall-Of-Sound production style and how Brian incorporated it to his own use starting with the album Pet Sounds.

This movie is about Dennis and his rebel ways. The guy playing Charles Manson isn't even as good as the VH1 movie. This Manson looks like he's wearing a fake wig and beard (which he no doubt is).

For some reason, I can't find a DVD version of the VH1 movie. I would love to have a copy of it. When it aired on VH1, I recorded it onto VHS but it has since been lost. Believe me. That was a much better version of the story of The Beach Boys.",1210032000,6,1082,4.167464114832536

558098,4,6303085237,"ideas as opiates: there's alot of unpublished stuff out there that I would like to see come to light, if possible.  Obscure documentaries like, say the birth of Eric Burdon and War, or maybe the Isleys Brothers, Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, Tina Turner, Carole King just to name a few.  Or how about classic albums that weren't in Billboard's top 200...stuff you gotta drag outa the archives (if there are any) like Emerson Lake and Palmers Trilogy (how in the world did that really happen? try playing this live)that helped lay down the tracks for this overkill cliche ridden plagiarized corporation tee shirt crap we know today as popular music in this who's really black and who's really white new millenium.  But back to the Beach Boys (and your pseudo interest in a cynical burned out mid aged replicant like me)$$$.....good movie about the rise and fall of the California Dream.  Hippies and drugs and the end of the innocent but a major break in the career of a worth his salt actor Bruce Greenwood, the story of an unhappy and jealous father who exploits the talents of his own flesh and blood out of just pure good old-fashioned meanness.  God Only Knows why anyone would set out to mentally twist such a great and inherent God given talent as Brian Wilson but hey, it happens every day right, Dr. Phil?  And the ever loving Mother Wilson who sits quietly in the back seat as the twisted journey continues offering her disturbed son the one true thing she has to give...her love.  Bless her pure and genuine role in this movie. What I enjoyed most was the relationship between Dennis and Brian...Dennis had the balls, Brian had the brains.  Put the two together and there you have it...Summer Dreams... blowin' thru the jasmine in your mind.......",1168300800,2,1757,4.718954248366013
558099,5,6303085237,"Bruce Greenwood gives the performance of his lifetime in this made for TV classic soap operaish drama about the boys of summer. I caught this on TV in 1995 at the age of 11, I really didn't understand a lot of it then but it gave me a better understanding of my favorite band at the time. Most Beach Boys fans and critics absolutely HATE this film and The Beach Boys themselves probably think it's awful also. The film is based on the book by Stephen Gaines called ""Heroes and Villians"" (which is quite trashy if I say so myself). The book is based on various interviews that I personally believe to be about 90% true. The book is filled with mass stuff that they couldn't put in the movie so ""Summer Dreams"" is kind of watered down to a degree. Greenwood plays the troubled drummer in the band, Dennis Wilson and he does an excellent job. The only problem is he looks 32 throughout the whole film instead of being 18. The guy who was cast as Mike Love is perfect as well as the gentleman who plays Murry Wilson. This movie focuses a little too much at times on Dennis and his death, Carl Wilson has died also since this film came out so it's a little bit dated. If you want a more up to date film regarding the Beach Boys, check out the John Stamos (very watered down)mini series ""The Beach Boys: An American Family"". This is a much longer/detailed story of the Beach Boys and it was officially approved by the Beach Boys themselves, their actual music is used in the film although the actors poorly lip sync throughout the whole movie. If you want the real story though, buy ""Summer Dreams"", it's worth the money for a true beach boy fan.",1093910400,28,1640,4.3452768729641695

7837175,4,6303085237,"I am shocked at all of these negative reviews. In fact, Summer Dreams was a lot more enjoyable than the movie focussing on Brian Wilson that I just saw in the theater (Love and Mercy). It is true that for some reason, this movie focusses more on Dennis rather than Brian Wilson. However, it still also focusses on the entire band as a whole and how they got started. I feel the music sounded very good and I actually even thought it was the real beach boys singing the first time I saw it. I also like the fact this movie didn't keep doing flashbacks and followed chronological order, with the exception of it beginning with a flash-forward of Dennis jumping off the boat and drowning. Summer Dreams also focussed on the nastiness of their Father and portrayed Dennis as a womanizer going from one relationship to another, treating every girl he dated like dirt by cheating on them. (Not sure how accurate this was). It also seemed to skip a few years between the time Dennis became acquaintances with Charles Manson to Brian going into his depression. I was always curious as to how Dennis supposedly got involved with Charles Manson in the first place and what business exactly took place between them? Or if any of it was true from the start? I still give Summer Dreams a solid 4 stars because you can definitely feel the authenticity of the different eras throughout the movie that tells a story and  not a documentary. It takes you to about 1985 and doesn't focus on any of Brian Wilson's accomplishments after the 80's.
