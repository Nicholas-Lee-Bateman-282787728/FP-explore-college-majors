8433835,5,B004L589E4,"Draw and Color with Uncle Fred is an amazing video!  My mom got it for me back in the 80s when I was learning to draw.  I still draw my elephants, monkeys, and grapes like Uncle Fred taught me to!  I still have a copy of my old video, now I need to get a VHS player so my daughter can learn to Draw and Color with Uncle Fred too!  I wish the producers would put all of Uncle Fred's videos out on DVD.",1298160000,,400,3.7261904761904763
