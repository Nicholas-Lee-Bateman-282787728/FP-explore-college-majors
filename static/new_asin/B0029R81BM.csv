3880387,4,B0029R81BM,"So finally the release is happening that Disney kept leading us on saying would not happen, so guess what kids? You want Zorro you have to buy it from the Disney Movie Club. Disney touted Zorro being a ""Disney Club Exclusive"", so like an idiot I believed them, and went and bought each of the 5 dvd sets that comprised season one at $20-$30 a pop from the club, then they decided to release the full season into a boxed set of the same discs for cheaper, again still only to the Movie club chump members like me. These versions were in the horrible colorization they did for the Disney Channel some years ago and had not a single extra, but Disney still led on this was all they would have available for Zorro as it ""wasn't a big seller"" according the folks I called at the Disney Club. Now lookee here lo and behold somehow magically Disney seems to think there might be more milk to the cow of this franchise and is willing to squeeze it for all its worth. Part of me is very happy with these releases, but part of me wants to curse Disney's dark soul in their duplicity and dirty double dealings. This is not the way to treat loyal customers: lie, lie and lie some more if it makes more money. I love old Disney entertainment, but man do I hate the modern company that dishes it out.

All of my ""old man ranting"" aside, it is nice that finally Zorro is getting the release it deserves, I just wish...beg... hope.. plead that they be more honest in the dealings they have with fans. I seriously feel used AGAIN, I really don't feel like I can ever trust them again after all the times I have and have been let down (like the edits in the Disneyland USA set when it was CLEARLY advertised in print ads as being ""original and uncut"".) Not to mention the incredibly limited numbers for the last set compared to the entire rest of the Treasures series. Is it so wrong as a customer to expect full honesty and integrity from a company that constantly eschews the same morals in their products? Do they want my trust and loyalty or just a chance to rape my wallet?",1244937600,65,2060,4.295629820051414
3880388,5,B0029R81BM,"Finally, comes the horseman known as Zorro!  This is the Guy Williams Zorro that we grew to know and love along with many viewers from the Disney Channel before it became Tween Disney.  Often Disney is notorious for releasing their classic live action media in substandard DVD form.  But, when Disney goes the ""Vault Disney or Treasures"" route, you get a fantastic treat.

3880394,5,B0029R81BM,"The 2nd season of Zorro featured shorter serialized story lines, that featured famed performers, such as Richard Anderson, Cesar Romero, and Annette Funicello, and Zorro, for a time, was seen riding a white stallion rather than Tornado. Still, the action was fast and furious, and Williams still filled the bill as the best Zorro of all time.

Of particular note is the character development that occurs during the second season.......

This collection, like the first, has been long out of print......but, hopefully, you can find the set available somewhere. It is truly disappointing that Zorro, as an on-going series, ended with the episodes here, although hour-long shows were done after the 30-minute shows had their day.",1384041600,4,726,5.25
3880395,5,B0029R81BM,"This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest Disney productions EVER and is a great example of classic American television. It was a shame how it went off the air after only 2 seasons.

This was a positive television show that a family could come together around and enjoy the clean humor and fine moral characters presented as the heroes, which is a great contrast to today when the criminals are glorified everywhere you look, people are constantly berated, mocked and humiliated for amusement, and negativity is spewed everywhere on every channel.

It also came with some little collectibles in the tin case, but I didn't intend to leave mine shrink-wrapped for value. It's good TV and it's meant to be watched. I'm halfway through the first season on my 3rd time through the series since I bought it. It really is that good.",1380240000,2,827,4.696551724137931
3880396,5,B0029R81BM,"I'm finally getting back to the last two installments in the wonderful Walt Disney Treasures line. This review is for Wave nine's second and sadly final release - season two of Zorro. A glorious 6 DVD set that features all 39 episodes of the popular TV series and two (the other two episodes are on season one)of the four hour long episodes that would have been part of season three. There are also a few short features about the program and character.

Each disc host 7- 8 episodes and the last disc features the bonus material. The show looks great even though the opening is a bit grainy which is mostly because it's made up from outside night shots and the over use of these pieces of film.

I wasn't alive when this series first ran, but surely remember the opening from when it was on TV in the 60's Like most of the Disney productions from the era, the show is quick paced and lively and for fans of the series a welcome treasure indeed.

Besides the 6 discs, there is a collector's pin and picture of the series star Guy Williams. For fans of the series this is as good as it's going to get, but after market prices have made this release a pricey investment, you'll have to decide if it's worth the plunge.

Guy Williams does his natural great job of portraying El Zorro!

3880401,4,B0029R81BM,"As I have already reviewed(the price) for season or set one, this is my response to several of you who criticized my logic.

 First of all, I love the series. And the production IS great, as is nearly all Disney product. However, there must be some misunderstanding as I criticized the price for the 6-disc set of season one and thought the price outrageous. Someone came up with a price of $6 a disc, I see $229 for just this first six-disc set. That's over $38 a disc! A bit steep. I own most of the Disney Treasures sets and paid under $30 for each two disc set. Fine. But $229 for just season one??? If it were for the full series, then I might understand. Am I missing something here...?

(I just put them back in the tin in DVD envelopes.) What a wonderful series this was! Fine acting, realistic sets, brilliant guest stars--even the music takes me back to watching the TV series as a child and being transported to Old California.

The item is overpriced and doesn't encourage me to purchase further titles of this product - considering that you can purchase similar products of other TV shows ffrom the Golden Age of TV for far less!

With the production methods that we have today - charging such high prices is not justified and the makers should look at their pricing as a matter of urgency.

3880407,5,B0029R81BM,"This is a fantastic collection to have, in fact, it's a must for Zorro fans!  Guy Williams in my eyes WAS Zorro!  It doesn't matter how old you are, this will entertain you.  All of the episodes were so well made, it's like watching a movie each time.  Walt Disney was a genius in everything he did and this is certainly no exception. My only disappointment is that there were only two seasons.  It should have gone on forever!",1316390400,,427,4.3544303797468356
3880408,5,B0029R81BM,"There were so many firsts on TV in Walt's Zorro. The Jose Greco dancers have a wonderful scene, and little footage is left of them. The hero, Zorro, dresses in black and rides a black horse. Until then, in most westerns, the hero wore white and had a light horse. Zorro introduced children to ""classes of people"" that still exist today. Diego was in the upper class, and yet he was the defender of the lower classes. Britt Lomond, who began season one as Capitan Monastario, was a wonderful fencer, and brilliantly funny everytime someone came between him and catching Zorro. It was a subtle look of anger, a growl he sometimes did, and his funniest scenes were with Sgt. Garcia (beloved Henry Calvin). Because Britt had a sense of humor about this show, and so did Guy, we, the viewers, got a chance to see Guy throw his head back and laugh that wonderful laugh from his heart and it reverberated through his entire soul. We never ever saw that again on film. One summer I sat my four teen age kids down and made them watch two episodes a night. They were hooked by the sixth night, and kept reminding my husband and myself that is was the ""Zorro Hour."" It was a wonderful summer that culminated in a trip to the Mission San Luis Rey where Father Ben even let us go up the bell tower one at a time. He remembered that from what he had seen of the earlier Zorro releases, Zorro genuflected as he crossed the church and made the sign of the cross which has all been changed since then. Father thought it was wonderful to have it on film. Take a few months and watch volume one and two (Zorro gets a girl friend) and you will know why it is still shown in Hispanic countries daily today. The series taught honor, self sacrifice, and so many wonderful things that sure replaced the gold rush in my memory of old California. The second set is necessary just to watch for the guest stars and how they did or did not adjust to a ""South Western."" Section 2 has Dan Blocker before Bonanza. I dare you all to find him!  Season two fills in all of the gaps left by season one, including the question,""How could Zorro's own father not know??????"" You'll see in season two. The writers provided us with a wonderful 1/2 hour a week that was unmatched thanks to Guy, the ""McHearthrob"" of his time.  Suziola",1315958400,4,2292,4.377934272300469

I know there was some sort of squabble between Walt Disney and ABC as Walt was trying to move to NBC and color, but this was really an exceptional series and the viewer got the short end of it with the premature cancellation. A wit and a warmth to the characters, great production values, and all the swash and buckle that you could want with the sword fighting and daring do.

3880425,5,B0029R81BM,"Guy Williams and Tyrone Power, neck and neck for the title of Best Zorro Ever. ZORRO - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON treats us to 39 more swashbuckling episodes before the curtain falls on this classic Disney television series. Right away we note a few changes. The first thirteen episodes present a venue shifted from Los Angeles to Monterey. Also Zorro now rides a white stallion named Phantom. And Disney experiments with a love interest for the our brave bandido, except that it doesn't stick. No ongoing mushy stuff was apparently tolerated by the core kid audience.

Guy Williams never had it so good as when he was playing Don Diego and his beloved outlaw counterpart El Zorro, although, yes, he was great in Disney's adaptation of THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER and I even liked him as CAPTAIN SINDBAD. Years later he would score another hit television show with LOST IN SPACE, but that was more of an ensemble cast and his Professor John Robinson wasn't exactly as dashing and daring as Zorro. Whenever Guy Williams' name comes up, I right away think of him wearing the black mask and cape and sombrero, flashing that impudent grin and that quicksilver sword - and, sometimes, not only the sword. Zorro also proves himself a master of the bullwhip and the bow and arrow and very dynamic at leaping on his horse from all kinds of crazy heights and angles. And, in this season, Don Diego pretty much does away with the feigned foppish behavior, although, to the public, he was still exceedingly inept with swordplay.

The series keeps it going with the lavish, no-expenses-spared period costumes and sceneries and with the high spirited action sequences, with Williams performing all his sword fights under the tutelage of swordsmaster Fred Cavens. I still love that theme song. And, speaking of songs, Henry Calvin's spherical Sergeant Garcia throws his strong baritone into diverting ditties like ""Tamales"" and ""Viva El Vino"" - and note that all the songs on this show are original. Speaking of Demetrio Garcia, the good-natured but dim-witted sergeant continues to get tricked silly, mostly thru the lure of wine and food, with his good friend Don Diego being the most frequent manipulator. Sgt. Garcia is so hapless that he could even get outmaneuvered by belligerent skunks (""Zorro Versus Cupid"").

This show was a monster hit for ABC and, in its second season, it drew in recognizable names like Cesar Romero, Robert Vaughn, and Ricardo Montalban (although, okay, Montalban was actually in WALT DISNEY PRESENTS Zorro special, which was originally meant to be in the third season of ZORRO). Annette Funicello had such a crush on Guy Williams that, as a present for her 16th birthday, Walt Disney allowed her to guest star in ZORRO for a three-episode story arc.

As in the collected first season, a handsome tin can holds all the goodies. There's a collectible Zorro pin, a lithograph of Guy Williams as Zorro, a Certificate of Authenticity, and a tiny handbook featuring an overview by Leonard Maltin as well as listing Season 2's episode titles and air dates. The 39 episodes are on five discs, with film critic Leonard Maltin performing introduction duties. The sixth disc contains the bonus features: The one hour specials ""The Postponed Wedding"" & ""Auld Acquaintance"" from the anthology series WALT DISNEY PRESENTS, aired more than a year after ZORRO's cancellation and with an introduction from Walt Disney himself. ""The Postponed Wedding"" features Annette Funicello, playing a girl foolishly eloping with her dowry and she sings two songs along the way (this is not the same character she played in Season 2). In the terrific ""Auld Acquaintance"" Ricardo Montalban eyes the army payroll and thirsts for a rematch with the one man who defeated him in a fencing duel - Don Diego.

""Behind the Mask"" is an excellent 8-minute profile of Guy Williams, with thoughts offered up by his son Guy Williams, Jr. and his stunt double Buddy Van Horn. Lastly; ""A Trip to the Archives"" is an 11-minute Zorro show & tell at the Walt Disney Archives hosted by Leonard Maltin and Guy Williams, Jr. This is a neat segment as the two gents go over the Zorro and Don Diego costumes, piece by piece, as well as other Zorro paraphernalia and memorabilia.

Breaking down the Season 2 episodes:

- Episodes #1-5 - The first arc has Don Diego de la Vega and his mute man-servant Bernardo looking into a rash of robberies in old Monterey as potential investors and their couriers are being ambushed while carrying funds intended to purchase supplies from Spain. The beautiful seorita Anna Maria Verdugo (Jolene Brand) is introduced and quickly turns Zorro's head.

- Episodes #6-9 - Zorro is caught in the middle of a struggle between a hotheaded rebel and a crooked local adjutant and his enforcer, the abusive Capitan of the Monterey garrison. It's too bad that the young rebel is so resentful and prickly-tempered that he quickly becomes unlikable.

- Episodes #10-13 - Richard Anderson in as unrepentant prankster and Diego's old friend Ricardo del Amo. Del Amo also becomes Diego's romantic rival for Anna Maria, except that her eyes are firmly fixed on a certain bold renegade. Keep an eye out for ""Amnesty for Zorro"" as it features an unexpected revelation.

- Episodes #14 & 15 - ""The Runaways"" and ""The Iron Box"" are stand-alones and return the cast to Los Angeles and Zorro back on the splendid black steed Tornado. But I wonder what Diego did with Phantom?

- Episodes #16-19 - Cesar Romero strolls in as Esteban de la Cruz, the silky-tongued caballero who matches wits and style points with Zorro. In one of his early scenes Romero also dazzles us with his nimble dancing.

- Episode #20 - ""Spark of Revenge"" - is another stand-alone, and it's one of the few that bored me, even if it does have Robert Vaughn in it. The plot takes place during a drought season and concerns a neighboring peasant's absconding of a proud land owner's water reserves.

- Episodes #21-23 - Annette Funicello shows up for this storyline as a seorita with an overactive imagination come to Los Angeles to find her long-missing father. Her bold lies and exaggerations soon have everyone doubting her every word.

- Episodes #24-26 - A boisterous American mountain man invades Los Angeles and causes all kinds of grief for an outraged don and, inevitably, for Zorro. Good news is that all that time he spends hiding in a water barrel, he's gotta be the least offensive smelling mountain man in Spanish California.

- Episodes #27-30 - An avaricious emissary of the King of Spain, Seor Basilio, darkens the pueblo of Los Angeles to raise funds for Spain's war effort, and we know right away he's evil because he ruins Sergeant Garcia's birthday party. Basilio soon moves on to more sinister plans, and in fact he more than any other foe gets the closest to besting El Zorro.

- Episodes #31 & 32 - The next two episodes are stand-alone stories, involving, respectively, Zorro's fighting a duel and chasing a stolen golden chalice.

- Episodes #33-36 - This arc concerns a deceitful capitan and a conspiracy to assassinate the governor.

- Episodes #37-39 - The series's final three episodes are stand-alones, in which Zorro in turn deals with a crooked fortune teller, a mysterious captive Chinese boy, and bandits who frame Bernardo for robbery. And that's Season 2. To quote our brave bandido: ""Adios, muchachos!""",1266710400,3,7385,4.86624203821656

The stories are well written and it takes you back to a time that we don't see on TV anymore. I watched the series when it was repeated on the Disney Channel several years back and never tired of it. When it came out in dvd, I had to have both seasons. When there's the nothing on TV (all 100+ channels), my husband and I will watch Zorro. In fact, he commented one night that he couldn't wait to get home from work to watch it.

Some might say that it doesn't depict reality, well the same can be said for all the reality, blood and gore, and silly humor shows that are on TV today, not too mention the whole family can enjoy it without embarrassment or waiting till the kids go to bed.

3880442,5,B0029R81BM,"This is the second Collector's Tin Zorro release by Disney; as with the first season's tin a limited series of 30,000 were issued. Each contains an individually numbered certificate of authenticity, a 7"" x 4.5"" black and white publicity still of the title character (this time as alter ego Don Diego), a collectible pin, a booklet about the serial, and six disks.  This release covers the final 39 episodes (there were 78 total) of the series, originally broadcast by ABC during the 1958-59 television season.  Also included are two (of four) 60 minute episodes which were broadcast as part of ""Walt Disney Presents"" anthology series in early 1961.

It is a first class release with special features pretty much identical to the first season release.  Again there is a nice Leonard Maltin introduction and some on-point featurettes.

Made in the style of the old Saturday-matinee action-adventure serials; Disney began and closed each episode with a rousing theme song about the adventures of Spanish California's most famous swordsman.  The beginning song was replaced mid-way through the second season with a montage of clips from the preceding episode.

Out of the night,
When the full moon is bright,
Comes the horseman known as Zorro.
This bold renegade
Carves a ""Z"" with his blade,
A ""Z"" that stands for Zorro.

Zorro, Zorro, the fox so cunning and free,
Zorro, Zorro, who makes the sign of the Z.

He is polite,
But the wicked take flight
When they catch the sight of Zorro.
He's friend of the weak,
And the poor and the meek,
This very unique senor Zorro.

Zorro was a 1820's Mission California version of Robin Hood.  Although fictional (first appearing in a 1919 five-part pulp magazine serial by Johnston McCulley) he bears a resemblance to Joaquin Murrieta, a semi-legendary outlaw who was either an infamous bandit or a Mexican patriot, depending on one's point of view.

Guy Williams plays young Don Diego, who during Season One had returned to California from several years of university study in Spain with his mute manservant Bernardo (Gene Sheldon) to help his father Don Alejandro (George J. Lewis).  His newly acquired foppish ways are a disappointment to his father.  But playing the wimp is simply an act to protect his secret identity; as he has become the champion of the oppressed, donning the black outfit and mask of Zorro and carving a ""Z"" in places that embarrass the corrupt territorial officers and political appointees.  During Season Two Don Alejandro learns the real identity of Zorro and can once again be a proud father.

Bernardo and Sergeant Garcia (Henry Calvin) provide comic relief and would be paired a couple years later in Disney's ""Toby Tyler"". Disney sweetheart Annette Funicello appears in several season two episodes and is given a fair amount of actual screen time.

The film Zorro dates back to Douglas Fairbanks (Sr.) in the silent ""Mark of Zorro"" (1926).  The Disney entry's format is more the 12-episode cliffhanger serial ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"".  ""Zorro"" in total is a little choppy.  While many of the episodes are pieces of multi-part tales; each with a few new supporting characters; others have no link to the established time-line and are largely independent of what has gone before and what will follow.  So there is not always the sense of progress that held other serials together. This is more apparent when viewing this collection in broadcast order; something that was not an issue when they were later shown in hit and miss syndication.

I like the early California settings at the Missions, the music, the slick production and the charming beginning and ending credits.  The only thing missing would be the commercials and the station ID's for KABC.  TV series on DVD are always odd purchases for me because the completist in me craves having the entire series in order to savor, but yet I rarely watch an entire season of anything on DVD.

3880461,5,B0029R81BM,"(In the interest of your time, please note that this review is also attached to season one, but please read it if you haven't already. I think you'll find it interesting if you're a classic TV fan.)

I grew up knowing Walt Disney's Zorro TV show more from the famous theme song than the show itself. There were reruns in syndication and a revival on The Disney Channel (with special emphasis on the Zorro episodes featuring Annette) but I don't think I saw more than a handful, I must admit. I missed the show at the peak of its initial success in the late '50s.

That's why I wanted to experience every episode from both seasons on the new Walt Disney Treasures releases. I must say, after 78 shows and four extra Walt Disney Presents hours, it is an extremely rich and entertaining television, far and above most similar programs of its era. And while there are the issues of political incorrectness (ethnicity, roles of women, drink and smoking), there's an amazing relevance to the overall series and perhaps a social influence beyond that.

Zorro rarely opposes standard robbers and bandits. His main adversaries are authority figures who have exploited their positions for wealth and power. They use people like playthings and often have mental problems (after all, The Caine Mutiny was popular around this time).

Because the episodes, while somewhat self contained, are almost always multi-part ""arcs,"" much like today's episodic TV shows, these villains are permitted to oppress and pillage until they sink under their own weight. Zorro sees to it that their plans fail and eventually that they are put either in jail or outside any real influence.

Among the most interesting of these antagonists are, of course, Monastario (Britt Lomond), who sets the standard for the ""executive"" villain, but perhaps it is Jose Sebastian Varga, who has a secret identity as Zorro does -- 'The Eagle"" -- that is among the most memorable. Played by Charles Korvin (whom fans of The Honeymooners will recognize as Carlos Sanchez, who taught Ralph, Alice and Mrs. Manicotti how to mambo), Varga is a complicated man, with sharp mood swings (punctuated by a voice that becomes shrill) and a paranoid fear of being alone. Don Diego (Guy Williams in his Clark Kent identity when he's not Zorro) and his servant, Bernardo (Gene Sheldon) actually subject Varga to a ""Gaslight"" type scare fest.

Speaking of Bernardo, his role as ""servant"" is so much more, of course. As played brilliantly by Gene Sheldon, he is a mute who also feigns hearing impairment in order to listen in to conversations. By today's standards, Bernardo would perform the same role but perhaps be called a ""personal assistant.""

Sgt. Garcia, a role defined by the versatile Henry Calvin (who co-starred in Broadway's Kismet and did a brilliant Oliver Hardy to Rob Petrie's Stan Laurel on a great Dick Van Dyke Show episode) is classic middle management. He's always eager to please his boss du jour, hoping that each successive replacement might not be as corrupt as the last, and also yearning for a promotion that never comes. Don Diamond joins the cast a few episodes into the show as Garcia's sidekick, a role he repeated in a manner of speaking on The Flying Nun, when he partnered with Vito Scotti as the Clouseau-like Captain Fomento.

Scotti is among the legion of guest stars that appear on the series and the four hour shows. In The Complete Season One set, look for Vinton Hayworth (General Schaefer on I Dream of Jeannie); Joan Shaklee (Buddy's wife Pickles on The Dick Van Dyke Show); Anthony George (Burke Devlin on Dark Shadows), and the beloved Mary Wickes (of countless shows from I Love Lucy and Dennis the Menace to Sigmund and the Sea Monsters and the Mickey Mouse Club's Annette serial).

Annette plays two roles in The Complete Season Two package: a young daughter in search of her father (the role Walt famously gave to her as a sweet 16 gift since Guy Williams was her teen idol), singing Jimmie Dodd's ""Lonely Guitar,""  and as a feisty young woman with bad taste in boyfriends, singing Richard & Robert Sherman's ""Amo Que Paso"" and ""Como Esta Usted.""

Music features prominently in many Zorro episodes, from original songs created primarily for the operatic Calvin or Bill Lee (who sings offscreen for Williams and also guest star Cesar Romero) to William Lava's score, which weaves themes for Zorro, Bernardo and Garcia (the last of which reminds me a bit of the Nutcracker March).
Season two features more guests stars then season one, since the series was a huge hit by then. They include spaghetti western stalwart Lee Van Cleef, as well as Michael Forest and Barbara Luna (both seen on the classic Star Trek series); Richard Anderson (Six Million Dollar Man & Bionic Woman); Whit Bissell (The Time Tunnel); Tige Andrews (The Mod Squad), Neil Hamilton (Batman), Robert Vaughn (The Man from UNCLE); George Neise (Leo Fassbinder on The Dick Van Dyke Show) and none other than Lost in Space's Dr. Smith himself, Jonathan Harris!

The hour long shows all feature celebrity guests. In addition to Annette, there's Rita Moreno (the same year as West Side Story), Ross Martin (The Wild, Wild West) and Ricardo Montalban (Fantasy Island). Walt Disney introduces each of the hours.

It's interesting to speculate that Zorro, which was a huge hit in 1957, depicting a renegade romantic hero who flew in the face of errant authority, might have inspired the youth of the day to revolt ten years later when it seemed to happen in real life with Vietnam and Watergate. And today, those baddies can be compared with maniacal corporate cads like Bernie Madoff and Leona Helmsley.

It's a mistake to consider Walt Disney's Zorro as a footnote in television history or in Disney history. As the bonus features prove, the series was produced at a budget unheard of at the time and has a movie quality. The character never seems to go out of style -- just ask Antonio Banderas, who portrayed the hero in two recent films. But surely even he would acknowledge that Guy Williams in many ways made Zorro his own and may always be fondly remembered for the role.",1258675200,8,6126,4.833015267175573
3880462,5,B0029R81BM,"With Walt Disney's ""Zorro"" popular television series ending in 1959 after 78-episodes, for its 50th year Anniversary, Walt Disney is giving the classic action/comedy series special treatment with the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" release of ""ZORRO - The Complete First Season (1957-1958) and ""ZORRO - The Complete Second Season (1958-1959).

For the second season, this marks the tenth Walt Disney Treasures release in which a limited amount of DVD copies were printed (in this case - 30,000 were printed) and where the majority of the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" releases were animated releases, these two Zorro releases will be the first to receive an all-black tin case release.

This release contains the 39 episodes from the second season on five DVD discs and each episode has been digitally remastered.  Also, included are ""Zoro: The Postponed Wedding"" which aired January 1, 1961 on Walt's anthology TV series ""Walt Disney Presents"", ""Zoro: Auld Acquaintance"" aired on April 2, 1961 on ""Walt Disney Presents"", ""Behind the Mask"" about the life of Guy Williams featuring interviews with surviving cast and crew members, an author and his son Guy Williams Jr. and ""A Trip to the Archives"" featuring Leonard Maltin and Guy Williams Jr. visiting the Walt Disney Archives.  Included with each release is a certificate of authenticity signed by Roy E. Disney and Leonard Maltin (who personally selected the rare offerings in this set), a publicity still of Zorro and a Zorro pin (featuring the memorable silhouette of Zorro and Tornado the horse) and a booklet with episode listings for the second season and more.

""Zorro"" was the first major series that film man Walt Disney was very enthusiastic about.  Ratings were terrific with the first season earning over 35% and the second season earning over 40% in the ratings which is phenomenal but the only reason why the series was pulled off the air was because Disney was pursuing color and ABC wasn't and thus, because of this disagreement, both ""Zorro"" and ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" were pulled off the air.

The story of Zorro first appeared back in 1920 as part of a silent film starring Douglas Fairbanks. For the next 35 years, there would be several ""Zorro"" related films that were released.  But it was in Sept. 11, 1957 when Walt Disney introduced the character to audiences through the 4th Anniversary show of Walt Disney Presents and four weeks later, Zorro would debut on ABC on Oct. 10th. With the success of the first season of ""Zorro"", the second and final season was a ratings hit.

""Zorro"" takes place during the time of Spanish occupation of California (pre-1820 before Mexico won independence for California and took control of the state).  Where members of the Spanish colonial government are oppressing the Mexicans and Indians who occupy the land.  Meanwhile, Don Diego de la Vega (played by Guy Williams, ""Lost In Space"", ""Captain Sinbad"", ""Bonanza""), a scholar who trained in Spain makes his return to California along with his mute sidekick Bernardo (played by Gene Sheldon) and to see how people are being oppressed by Spanish rule.  With the success of the first season, the second season would feature guest stars such as Cesar Romero, Annette Funicello, Richard Anderson, Jonathan Harris, Jeff York and Ricardo Montalban.

Also, a few episodes in the second season would be three-parters instead of all stand-episodes.

The following episodes are included in ""Zorro - The Complete Second Season (1958-1959): The following are spoiler-less summaries of each episode.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""ZORRO - The Complete Second Season (1958-1959) - Walt Disney Treasures"" is featured in B&W and has been Digitally Remastered.  The series looks great for a television series that is over 50 years old.  For the most part, the blacks are nice and deep and grays are well-done.  There is a fine layer of grain and occasional dirt can be seen but for the most part, it is limited and I don't see any major banding or compression although the opening theme is a bit grainy.  But for the most part, the episodes look great.

As for the audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital.  The series is front channel driven and dialogue and music is clear.  For my preference, I watched the series with my receive set with stereo on all channels.

Subtitles are featured in English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""ZORRO - The Complete Second Season (1958-1959) - Walt Disney Treasures"" features an exclusive introduction by film historian Leonard Maltin on Disc 1.  On Disc 6, the following special features are included:

The following is the first special.  In this special, Annete Funicello plays the character of Costancia.
  * ZORRO: Auld Acquaintance (Original Air Date: April 2, 1961) - (49:00) Due to the series being pulled off ABC (due to disagreements of Disney pursuing color and ABC wanting to stay with B&W), the series made its return in the New Year (1961) via a two-part one hour special.  The following is the second special and stars Ricardo Montalban.
  * Behind the Mask - (7:52) In this featurette, cast members talk about working with Guy Williams and how he was as suave as Don Diego.  Guy Williams, Jr. talks about his father and we learn about his life up to his death from author Antoinette G. Lane (author of ""Guy Williams: The Man Behind the Mask"").
  * A Trip to the Archives - (10:55) Leonard Maltin visiting the Walt Disney archives with Guy Williams Jr. and seeing the classic Zorro outfit and talking about memorabilia for the show.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Zorro"" is an entertaining and classic hero-based series.  What made the series so exciting is that Walt Disney was behind the project and that the series was given the opportunity to have a higher production value.  So, you get that feel of an authentic old California during Spanish dominance.  The stories are light-hearted, fun, humorous but also very clever.  The high production values of the series were well-captured as evident in the set, production and costume design.  As well, as the music which helps emphasize the comedic or action moments in the series.

Although I was familiar with ""Zorro"" through the films, I have never seen any of the television episodes.  So, to finally watch them after hearing so much about Guy Williams stellar performance as the swashbuckling hero, I can see why many people enjoyed this series.

I can see how much Disney believed in this series and also spending money necessary to make sure that old California was presented well through the production design, the costumes and also the dialect.  I actually thought that a lot of the people on the show were Latino but later finding out that Guy Williams (Don Diego/Zorro) was Italian, Gene Sheldon (Bernard) and Henry Calvin (who played Sergeant Garcia) were Americans and Don Diamond (Corp. Reyes) was Russian.  But the series was also instrumental in hiring many Latino to have roles in the film, not only for this season but for the next.

Don Diego is the classic hero/vigilante that was created way before Bruce Wayne/Batman and he was a Robin Hood of sorts.  Taking down corruption and even helping out the poor.  He was a hero that many people identified with at the time and have heard from adults who remember those years when they would dress up as Zorro because they idolized him.  Granted, there are man portrayals of Don Diego in film and books but Disney was able to capture that flair of coolness with Guy Williams as the hero and for the most part, he is a hero that truly rocks!  It's been over 50 years since the series debuted on television and watching it, I can see why people enjoyed the series.  It's a well-done, enjoyable and highly entertaining series that captures that sense of adventure, action and tuning in for each episode watching Zorro take on those who would oppress the people, meeting the beautiful women but at the same time, remaining a gentleman.  I'll go even further to say that the show also had cultural impact.

""Zorro - The Complete Second Season"" was much different than the first in the fact is that there is more action sequences and also more special guest stars with Mouseketeer Annette Funicello, Cesar Romero and many others playing a character role in the series.  Also, unlike the first season which were all stand-alone episodes, the second series had a few episodes which were three-parters.  And these slight changes definitely help benefit the series in the ratings as it scored up to 40% which is incredible, especially for a series that is 39 episodes long.

Overall, if you were a fan of ""Zorro"" or are interested in classic television series, this series is quite fun to watch and I watched it alongside my six-year-old who was also entertained by the series.  The set as part of the Walt Disney Treasures line was pretty cool, especially the black tin case and the certificate of authenticity noting the limited production of the series.  But as a person who does watch classics, it's great to see Walt Disney release one of the highest rated television shows of all time on DVD.  Definitely recommended!",1257292800,35,13400,4.6
3880463,4,B0029R81BM,"Generally speaking, I do not purchase DVD's of old TV shows.  Experience has taught me that programs I thought were wonderful and really cool when I was 12 years old, usually turn out to be plain awful when viewed through adult eyes.  In fact, there were two of my childhood TV favorites that I simply ""had to have"" when they were released on DVD, for which I never even bothered to acquire the second season, because after 40 years, I found the productions were cheaply done and the plots simply made no sense.

However, when I was only four years old, a show debuted that I remember as a real event in my house.  Not being a member of the Disney Movie Club - I don't even know what that is - or a subscriber to the Disney channel, I had long forgotten the show that prompted my older brother to run around in a homemade mask and black sheet, pretending to be a swashbuckler.  But when I accidentally stumbled on this new release at Amazon last month, something nostalgic inside me told me to go for it, and I am very glad I did.

I received the boxed sets of both seasons yesterday, and sat down for a long evening to see if the shows were going to be as silly as I was afraid they might be.  What a pleasant surprise!  Based on the first seven episodes, the stories are well written, the acting is credible (especially for a 1957 television show) the laughs genuine and the action plentiful.  The stunts and special effects are first rate, and Guy Williams is every bit as charming and handsome as I remembered, even though I was only three when the show premiered.  The prints have been restored beautifully, and there is not a scratch on them.  The opening titles have not been digitally restored, but I can live with that.

I could have done without the intro by Leonard Maltin, who is probably my least favorite movie critic, but the other extras are pretty cool.  The inclusion of the four one-hour Zorro Disney specials is very much appreciated, and the keepsakes - each has a different Zorro pin, a photo card of Guy Williams and a certificate of authenticity - are very nice.  All in all, this is one of the first TV shows I've added to my DVD collection that was actually worth the price, and unlike some other TV shows from my long departed youth, I do not regret the purchase at all.

3880464,5,B0029R81BM,"The Complete Second Season is the definitive version that Disney Zorro fans have waited years for. Covering the 39 episodes that comprise season #2 (1958-1959), this limited edition (and numbered) 6-disc set of 30,000 includes a Certificate of Authenticity, a collectible pin (very handsome showing a silver sword with a shadow of Zorro & his horse superimposed on top), as well as a black-and-white photo postcard showing Guy Williams in his Zorro costume. A booklet outlining the contents of the set can also be found here. The set comes handsomely encased in a black metal tin, fitting of this B&W series where the hero wears an all-black costume.

A 3:29 intro by Leonard Maltin introduces the episodes and gives a brief overview of the series and these particular episodes along with the extras on these discs. The remastering is evident on these episodes. The picture is clear and so is the sound; naturally, with the way it was originally recording, a digital surround experience is not possible, but the Dolby Digital recording is crisp, clear, and the score sounds better than it has in years. And no...there are no colorized versions here. Just the genuine black and white originals.

Besides the 39 episodes (starting with ""Welcome to Monterey"", original air date of 10/9/1958 and finishing with #39 ""Finders Keepers"", original air date of 6/2/1959), there is a 6th disc of bonus material. Here you will find 2 hour long episodes:

1. ""Zorro: The Postponed Wedding,"" original air date of 1/1/1961, from Walt's anthology TV series ""Walt Disney Presents."" Clocking in at 49:04, this episode features Annette Funicello, who is beginning to mature into a very pretty young lady.

2. ""Zorro: Auld Acquaintance,"" original air date of 4/2/1961, from Walt's anthology TV series ""Walt Disney Presents."" Starring Ricardo Montalban & Ross Martin (""Wild Wild West"") this episode is 49:09 long.

There is also a featurette entitled, ""Behind The Mask"" (7:52) which is a short look at Zorro's leading man, Guy Williams. Also known as Professor Robinson on ""Lost In Space,"" Williams is often regarded as the quintessential Zorro. Well-liked by his costars (Suzanne Lloyd is quoted here as saying Williams was ""one of the most charming professional men I ever had the pleasure of working with""), he began as a model and then became a contract player at Universal. An injury sidelined him and caused him to take up fencing. A call to audition for Disney's Zorro was a fortuitous break for the actor, and catapulted him into stardom. Zorro's stunt double, Buddy Van Horn is also interviewed here, along with Williams' son, Guy Williams, Jr., who obviously has many fond memories of his father and this particular role. Interestingly enough, it is recounted that most action scenes were shot on Fridays so that any injuries would have the entire weekend to heal! Rare color movies of Williams performing at Disneyland as Zorro are shown here; Van Horn recalls them staying at the Disneyland Hotel and taking advantage of the carte blanche they had at the Hotel.

Finally take a trip to the Walt Disney archives in Burbank on the studio lot (10:55). Leonard Maltin and Guy Williams, Jr. display original costumes and sword from the show, calling particular attention to the lavish detail (genuine silver thread, exquisite embroidery, and heavy wool) that is evident in these pieces made by Western Costume. Two costumes are also shown with the famous ""Z"" emblazoned on them, including one for Henry Calvin's oafish and comedic Sergeant Garcia. Next up a generous sampling of the more than 500 licensed items that were sold to promote the Disney series, including lunch boxes, rings, child costumes, and even roller skates!

3880465,5,B0029R81BM,"Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment have announced the Region 1 DVD release of Wave 9 of their Walt Disney Treasures series. Available in limited quantity on 3rd November 2009 is Zorro: Season 1 and Zorro: Season 2.

The latest addition to the celebrated Walt Disney Treasures, Zorro, makes its fully restored black & white DVD debut. All 78 episodes of the timeless classic will be included on two new six-disc sets--making up the ninth installment of the popular Walt Disney Treasures, and for the first time, will be housed in collectible black, numbered unique tin cases.

From 1957 to 1959, Disney's Zorro was one of the most popular series on television starring Guy Williams, Henry Calvin, and Gene Sheldon. The show helped transform the literary character Don Diego de la Vega into the ultimate iconic, beloved swashbuckling masked hero of the time. The adventures of Zorro and his trusty steed Tornado have captivated audiences since their inception, gaining new audiences when it was re-aired on the Disney Channel in 1983 and re-colorizing the episodes in the 1990s. After the series conclusion, the Zorro adventures lived on from 1960 to 1961 on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color in the form of a four-episode anthology series of hour-long Zorro specials, all of which are also included in Walt Disney Treasures Wave IX.

Both debut Walt Disney Treasures sets are hosted by noted film historian, author and critic Leonard Maltin. Each limited edition, individually numbered volume includes a Zorro pin, an authenticity certificate, exclusive lithograph and comes in a unique, collectible black tin.

3880466,5,B0029R81BM,"I just received the latest information from Disney, that Zorro- The Complete First and Second Seasons will be available in very limited quantities. Both Zorro dvd sets are being specially made to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the series finale in 1959. Disney has restored and remastered the original black and white film of Zorro that premiered in 1957, and they claim it looks unbelievable, just like it originally aired, only in high definition and absolutely pristine! Each of these two seasons of Zorro will contain 6 discs, with new, never before seen Bonus materials that include introductions by film historian Leonard Maltin. The bonus materials will be 2 hours long per set and included in each Season will also be an exclusive Zorro pin and lithograph. Both sets will be individually numbered and include a certificate of authenticity.

After seeing what has been happening with other limited edition Disney dvd sets, such as Dr. Syn-The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh, The Mickey Mouse Club Presents Annette and the wonderful Donald Duck Chronological Series, it does pay to pre-order, as these sets are steadily rising in value. Disney originally made these first TREASURE sets in limited quantities of 150,000, but they are now extremely limited as they are being made in very small quantities of 39,500 or less. Both of these very limited Zorro Seasons will be released November 3rd, 2009, so it gives you a few months to save up to pay the pre-order prices when they arrive. It looks like Zorro will quickly join the Disney Treasures that will climb in value soon after it's release! I'm pre-ordering before Zorro rides away on his trusty horse Tornado, never to be seen again, unless you pre-order now or have unlimited money later!",1249171200,6,1748,4.986301369863014

Would like to know from the informed or Disney themselves, if this is going to be a limited release? As with their ""Scarecrow"" release it was gobbled up by sellers on this site and others, where now you have to pay thru the nose for a copy of ""Scarecrow."" Same has happened to ""Secret Agent Man"" and the ""Prisoner"" sets. All these sets are overpriced, especially in todays hard financial economy. If any one knows please a provide your response as I would like to pay a fair price for these items without having to pre-order before the item comes out. I like to read the reviews after the items come out to see if my hard earned dollars should be spent. Nuff said!

8358072,4,B0029R81BM,"As big a DisNerd as I am, there are still parts of the Disney legacy I have no clue about.  Such was the case when both seasons of Zorro were released as part of the Walt Disney Treasures series (a DVD series I wish they would continue).  And while I had never heard of it before, I enjoyed watching Zorro Season 2.

As with all takes on this character, the action revolves around Don Diego de la Vega (Guy Williams).  By day, he is the carefree son of a land owner in 1820s Spanish owned California.  But at night he is Zorro, a wanted outlaw who actually works to make sure law and order reign supreme in the territory.  Some times he opposes real outlaws and thieves; other times, hes fighting government officials who would oppress the people.  He works closely with his mute servant Bernardo (Gene Sheldon), and he gains another ally in this season.  The stories run from several episodes to just a stand alone adventure.

Actually, the action opens in Monterey as Diego is on a mission to deliver money there for supplies to help his native Los Angeles.  Hes just barely arrived when someone tries to rob him of the money.  The trouble only intensifies as Sergeant Garcia (Henry Calvin) and Corporal Reyes (Don Diamond) arrive with the money.  Before they all return to LA, Zorro must free the people of Monterey from an acting governor who is making unreasonable demands.  Then Diego and a prankster friend get caught up in a battle for a hand of a woman.

After thirteen episodes, the action moves back to LA, but things don't calm down.  A new Comandante always seems to bring problems, and thats the case again.  When two indentured servants are not permitted to marry, Zorro winds up involved.  A mountain man comes to the pueblo and almost gets himself hung.  And when the governor has an accident outside the Diegos, his life is suddenly in danger.

Some of the episodes are very suspenseful, but others are on the comedic side.  Even the suspenseful side of things has the lighter moments since Garcia and Reyes are still bumbling comic relief figures.  I love laughing at their antics, although the adult in me appreciates the fact that Diego still considers them friends and treats them with respect.

Each episode manages to find Zorro in a sword fight.  These are actually quite well done, especially for TV in the 1950s.  Some of the stunts are also impressive as well.  Frankly, all of this holds up well today.  Only a couple of times do they use special effects, and you could tell what was really happening, but it was inventive for the time and budget, and its not a huge distraction.

The acting is not award worthy, however it suits the tone of the show well.  I never have an issue believing these characters in these situations, and theres nothing that throws me out of the show.  Guest stars in this season include Annette Funicello. who shows up for a three episode story involving a young teen who arrives looking for her father  a man no one has heard of.  Also, Cesar Romero plays Diegos uncle who arrives determined to get rich after his time in California.

Every so often, they include some songs in the show.  Frankly, I feel they usually slow things down a little, but they are a minor complaint.

Likewise, there is a certain level of lightness to the entire production.  I don't mind, necessarily, but it does feel a bit dated as a result.  The more I got into the show, the more I forgot about that, however, and started to really enjoy it.  When you remember that the target audience was really kids, that lightness certainly makes sense.

This being a show from the 1950s, they did a new half hour episode every week.  When you think about that, the stunts and effects that don't quite work are certainly forgivable.  They were just cranking them out.

Anyway, all 39 episodes of the show are compiled here on 5 discs.  They are in their original black and white and full frame picture with mono sound.  While certainly not up to todays standards, they do look and sound very good.  Theyve been well preserved and restored.

This is a six disc set, and disc six has the bonus features.  The main bonus is the third and fourth of four hour long Zorro episodes that aired on the anthology show Walt Disney presents after the original show was canceled.  (The first two hour long episodes were on the season one set.)  There is also a profile of the actor with memories from his son and the stunt man who worked on the show.  We also get an up close and color look at some of the costumes and merchandise from the show.  Leonard Maltin, of course, introduces the season on disc one.

The show definitely feels dated, but there is still charm to Zorro Season 2.  If you are looking for some light action, this show will fit the bill.",1434067200,,4772,4.528103044496487
