When this film project was started, it was to show the loosening of restrictions in Czechoslovakia.  While still a part of the Soviet world, the Czechs were beginning to develop signs of openness in society due to some reformers and moderates in the government.  This period is known as the ""Prague Spring.""  The first half of the film documents some of these things, such as the budding youth culture that included an antiwar movement.  People were excited to participate in public debate and politics.  Here you can see some of the only footage of this brief moment where people were trusted to make some of their own decisions.

The boys in Moscow weren't pleased with the decentralization going on in Czechoslovakia.  To deal with the matter, they rolled in some Warsaw pact tanks.  The party was over and if you didn't think so you were literally beaten in the street.  The film's second half shows the occupation of Prague and it isn't pretty.  Destruction of property and suppression of dissent were immediate and it is difficult to imagine what it is like to experience these events while they were in progress.  That is one of the reasons this film is so important: to show just how fast things can go bad.  The spirit of the earlier months does show through at times.  For example there is a scene where we see students distributing literature that is critical of the Soviets, and a later shot of a soldier reading one of these pamphlets with great interest!  The narration says that perhaps the text will bring the soldier to a change of heart.

This film is not very long but it is important.  It wasn't that long ago that this took place!  Thank goodness Mr. Nemek was there with his camera to document this terrible event.",1252540800,2,1811,4.695238095238095
