8101784,3,B000CSNA8Y,"As Infants, Kwon Hyuk Joon and Yoon Jung Sook are arranged to be married in the future. Their families even sign a contract with each other to confirm their promise to one another. But shortly afterwards, Jung Sook's family disappears in the middle of the night due to financial problems.

Eighteen years later and Jung Sook, a feisty and hopeless romantic, falls in love at first sight with a man wearing traditional clothing. She soon finds out that the man she is arranged to marry is in fact the same man she fell in love with.

Jung Sook has always been unsure what she wants in life. After meeting Hyuk Joon, she decides she wants nothing more than to be a devoted and caring wife. After much thought, the two end up getting married, but it's not going to be an easy marriage. The two are complete opposites and are constantly clashing over every little thing. Plus, Kwon Hyuk Joon comes from a very traditional family. He will soon become the next head of the family, which comes with many responsibilities. Being Kwon Hyuk's wife, Jung Sook must learn the traditional ways of doing things, such as cooking the old fashioned way, trying to impress the strict and narrow-minded elders, learning traditional customs/manners/history of family, and there is even the added pressure of producing an heir. While Jung Sook is learning the ins and outs of traditional life, Kwon Hyuk is working hard as a prosecutor on a risky case that involves gangsters. The case puts both Kwon Hyuk and Jung Sook in danger. Can these two overcome all their obstacles and become a loving married couple?

This isn't one of my favorite Korean dramas, but it was an alright romantic comedy. It has lots of comedy and sincerity and even some action. It can be pretty entertaining. I recommend giving it a try. (16 episodes) (Also known as, ""Sweet 18."")",1390089600,,1834,4.707165109034268
8101785,2,B000CSNA8Y,"I completely agree with the previous reviewers and wish I had read them before purchasing from this seller.  The DVD disc quality is POOR at best.  The picture quality is grainy and at least 2 episodes ""lose"" their English translation. The English translation in an of itself is absolutely POOR.  Discounting the numerous spelling errors and typographical errors, the translation is incorrect many times.  Another reviewer gave more details on examples of the poor translation.  Also, in 2 episodes, the picture freezes in multiple segments.  I do not know why this seller, Rolling Donut, continues to carry this product.  Can they not obtain a good quality DVD AND fire the currently company providing the English subtitles/translation?",1303430400,,737,5.301724137931035
8101786,5,B000CSNA8Y,"This was the first ever Kdrama I have ever watched (back in 2004) and I have been watching them ever since.  I really liked the chemistry between these two actors. I am giving it 5 stars because I really liked the show, but the DVD's I received were poor. 16+ hours of shows smashed onto two DVD's. The chapter breaks didn't match the show beginning and endings.  The English subtitles were as poorly translated as I have ever seen. Complete misuse of pronouns.  Wrong translations - ""of course"", was ""cos"".  They were constantly mixing the gender references - he instead of she, grandson instead of granddaughter. There were was also 30 minute section which the English subtitles did not work.  The subtitles were good enough to follow the story line, but that is it.  The unfortunate part is you get a lot of this poor DVD production of Kdramas, because so much of it comes out of China.  You have to learn to set your expectations low and hope to be surprised.",1290988800,,963,4.563953488372093
