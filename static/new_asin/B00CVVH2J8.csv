8586871,5,B00CVVH2J8,"I still give it 5 stars because I love this show but I was an idiot and did not read that it was not for my region.. I was just too excited to get it... My fault.. But the show is amazing... I just have to find the 5th season somehow.. Agghhhhh What kills me is that this does not play here, instead we have stupid duck dynasty and swamp pawn and all these stupid redneck shows.. It is infuriating to say the least..",1394496000,,416,3.9642857142857144
