8416865,2,B0045VURL2,"2012 Supernova was very inaccurate, for the space center they show one of the buildings at KSC; however, the route they take to the space center is through desert country with mountains.  #1 Florida does not have any mountains, #2 the road to KSC is bordered on each side by swamps not desert, and #3 Florida does not have any desert.  Megafault was much better.",1446422400,,362,4.553846153846154

Great for having friends over, ordering some pizza and chucking back some beer and having a MST3K party if you can't seriously get into it. Cinema snobs, or Academy members need not apply; this movie wasn't made for you.",1367625600,,414,4.594594594594595
