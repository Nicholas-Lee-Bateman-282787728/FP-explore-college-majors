8082010,4,B000B5XPE2,"Volume one of the ""Atomic Age Classics"" series focuses on manners and courtesy with eight black and white shorts from the 50's and 60's. The shorts range from dull but genuinely educational (""Good Table Manners"") to bizarre and hilarious (""By Jupiter"").

Most people will buy this set as a humorous reminder of educational films seen as children; in that vein they are prime nostalgia. If only the problems facing America were no more serious than the situations presented here (look how wild the teenage party in ""Social Courtesy"" is); in that regard it's almost sad to watch these as they point out how far society has disintegrated in the last sixty years.

I was especially fond of the otherworldly ""By Jupiter"" in which the Roman god Jupiter grants veteran actor Chick Chandler a chance to re-live an especially bad day in his life, but found the boredom of ""We Play and Share Together"" trying.

For a blast from the past this collection is upbeat, fun, and sure to make baby boomers feel right at home.",1239235200,,1008,4.748571428571428
8082011,5,B000B5XPE2,"Atomic Age Classics is a well selected series to education school age kids. It's nice, classic, and fine selective mini movies to teach our kids good manners in a natural way. Both my preteen son and I enjoy it very much and decide to watch it again. It is even better for elementary school kids. It's especially helpful for kids with some social difficulty by natural or culture.",1183075200,6,380,4.602941176470588
8082012,5,B000B5XPE2,Manners seem to be a thing of the past and in this DVD they certainly are.  This is a great DVD for anyone wanting to sure up the teaching of manners to their children.  My kids loved watching these and they learned some things.  We tried to put in practice some of the things taught.  I really appreciated the reprint of these classics.  Manners and etiquette are severely lacking in our culture.  oh that America would once again practice these common courtesies.  Great DVD for homeschoolers!!!,1142294400,13,497,4.709302325581396
8082013,5,B000B5XPE2,"The price on these films are perfect for those who want to get a little 1950s education in the 21st Century. Manners never go out of style. Maybe if kids of today can watch these films, they'll be better behaved in public. Ever notice that school kids got out of control after they removed 16mm projectors from the classroom?  The titles in this collection include: We Play and Share Together, Good Table Manners, Are manners Important? Social Courtesy, Everyday Courtesy, Exhaging Greetings and Introductions, Helping Johnny Remember and By Jupiter.

This is the perfect gift for anyone who loved these films back in school or young kids that want cheap laughs at 1950s ideals.",1135296000,9,678,4.93859649122807
