4251463,5,B0042JSSG8,"'Colditz' was I think never broadcast in the US, not even on PBS, but it's a Brit classic. Made in 1972/3, it stars David McCallum and Robert Wagner among many others, and focuses on the fear, isolation, cold, danger and indeed, the relentless boredom of being a PoW in an inaccessible location.

It was immensely popular in the UK on first transmission but very rarely repeated. Having just been re-run on a popular history-themed channel, it's gained a new following. I remember watching it a pre-teenager and not really getting it; as an adult I can really appreciate it. Obviously a lot of the episodes centre on escape attempts - watch out in particular for the award-winning episode 'Tweedledum', in which an RAF pilot tries to escape by a novel methos i.e. trying to get repatriated by fooling his German captors into thinking he's insane - with tragic and very moving consequences.

The Germans are on the whole portrayed as decent individuals who are just trying to do their jobs (with one notable exception in season 2) so thankfully it avoids the usual goose-stepping Nazi stereotypes.

Worth a look. You won't regret it.  Note: don't confuse this with the more recent and more forgettable 'Colditz: the 2-part mini-series' or other similar titles. This one is the real deal.",1318809600,20,1286,4.885321100917431

8413776,5,B0042JSSG8,"Excellent. The series was first on air 40 years ago. I was worried that it may not have aged well, and that my memories of the series may be dimmed by time. However, these fears were alayed as soon as I started watching the first episodes. This is a cracking good series and well worth watching",1426550400,,294,4.267857142857143

8413778,5,B0042JSSG8,Guaranteed BBC quality. I had seen this series when I was a child and I can remember it was exciting. Now watching it again it offerd totally different aspects to follow. Absolutely enjoyable.,1383955200,,192,4.848484848484849
8413779,5,B0042JSSG8,"I highly recommend reading Steveacoustic's well-written assessment.

The full series never aired in the U.S., and I doubt that it would have been successful here. There was, however, a television movie entitled, ""Escape from Colditz"", that was developed from the series and aired in the U.S.

""Colditz"" deserves a five-star rating. ""Colditz"" was filmed during the early 70's, when there were few special effects, and great series had to rely on a well-developed, cohesive storyline. ""Colditz"" delivered on the storyline, told through intelligent scripts and excellent ensemble performances.

While I enjoy the entire series, my favorite episodes begin with first season's ""Maximum Security"", when the primary cast had been assembled. I particularly enjoy the second season episodes, with the on-going war of wits and wills between Flt. Lt. Carter, the ""Escape Officer"" (portrayed by David McCallum), and Major Mohn (Anthony Valentine) woven through the storyline.",1371340800,4,963,5.627586206896551

Anybody who has studied history is aware of how they brutalized American soldiers as well as all of Europe, especially gypsies, Jews, mentally ill,...  Nazis were the worst scum of humanity.

8413781,3,B0042JSSG8,"this is not some average bang bang go get em boys combat movie. it is, however, in my view, one of the best tv series ever done. if you or someone you know, that may like a british tv series about P.O.W.'s, then this may be it.
i myself enjoy this. some folks will call it a melodrama soap opera style.  i don't care about that. people can criticize all they want. it's my choice for a good ww2 series.",1329177600,7,402,4.025
