David Niven was known to be an excellent actor, it was quite odd that the movie was overlooked to be shown to American audiences. Perhaps it was skipped over as it tells a story of military personnel in England and Italy, no American servicemen.  Regardless, the small group of servicemen that watched this movie on our small site, loved it.  Even today, I would buy a copy of this film to see if it still holds the fun and laugher brought to me years ago.  It holds so much truth showing how opposing armies can treat each other and it does so with many chuckles.",1438992000,,703,4.33587786259542
