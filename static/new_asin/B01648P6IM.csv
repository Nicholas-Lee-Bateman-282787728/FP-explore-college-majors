7456215,1,B01648P6IM,"As a curator of high-end black panther velvet paintings, I thought that this movie would be a great documentary piece to showcase continually in my gallery. Having not actually seen the movie first due to my busy schedule of acquiring the ebony bikini clad women on pool tables with panthers series, I simply ran the movie on a loop in the gallery mini theater.
It wasn't till about three days later that one of the teachers of the third grade class previously touring the gallery approached me about the movie. She said she wasn't sure how the movie related to the gallery paintings and most of the kids were afraid to go outside after seeing it. The other kids in the group who had seen it as well were not afraid, but rather they had become enraged. So much so, they were bullying the other kids through various means of psychological and physical intimidation.
The bullying had gotten so out of hand, that the good police became involved to put a stop to it.
Obviously, my curiosity had risen, so I decided to watch the movie to see what all the fuss was about.
After viewing the movie, I can honestly say it had nothing to do with black panther velvet paintings. All I saw was a bunch of angry nonsense about this guy mad about that guy for something I just didn't think it was important enough to really care about. In fact, I found myself laughing at how poorly this movie was made in both production value and competence.
Maybe this movie was actually meant to be one of the mockumentaries by poking fun at the intended serious subject matter.
Bottom line, I am glad that Amazon has a great return policy.",1454976000,10,1613,4.489795918367347

7456228,4,B01648P6IM,"This is a cringe-worthy documentary for someone who was in her 20's when the Panthers came to power. It is in-your-face and you can't turn away or change the channel. Some of the violent scenes shocked me back to the 60s and the violence I watched on Huntley/Brinkley news every night in Atlanta. But the people in California and other States were living it!

In 1968, when Oakland and other cities were at war with the police, I was living in peaceful Atlanta. Never heard of Eldridge Cleaver, never heard of Soul on Ice.  The tranquility was broken on the afternoon of April 4th when we learned of the assassination of Dr. King in Memphis. Weeks later, we were thrown for a loop when Bobby Kennedy died.  I sold all my belongings and left the country.

From Atlanta I moved to Havana, Cuba.  Don't have any illusions that I had become militant and anti-American by that move.  It was simply that I had a friend who lived there who arranged for me to come stay there until I could heal from the double whammy of the loss of my heroes.

One afternoon, a few months after I arrived, I was standing in line to get ice cream from the famous Coppelia Cafe. They made the best ice cream in the world with an 85% butterfat content. I was speaking English with my Cuban friend when two African-American men came up to me and asked me where I was from. It seems so strange now to hear them referred to as 'negro' in this documentary. Yes, we have come a long way, baby!

Long story short, they were Black Panthers from Oakland.  One of them was Eldridge Cleaver.  I was clueless.  He introduced himself as someone else fearing I would recognize him and the U S government would find out he had come to Cuba.  We got together a few days later and he told me who he was.  He was stunned that the name meant nothing to me.  I explained I was from Atlanta, a Young Democrat working in Bobby Kennedy's presidential campaign. I was the farthest thing from a militant American. I remember him sitting on the sofa laughing for ten minutes when he realized I had no idea who he was and didn't care.

I was invited to a private party at the home of the British Ambassador to Cuba and took him with me.  There were European journalists at the party and they recognized Cleaver immediately.  The Ambassador and his wife invited the two of us to join them on the veranda and they started talking about his book, Soul On Ice. He was flattered they knew him and his work. Things deteriorated rapidly when the Ambassador's wife asked Eldridge who his favorite authors were. He thought for a moment and said, ""Well, I think my favorite story is entitled, 'Up Against The Wall Mother------.""  Uh, OK. Without missing a beat, the Ambassador's wife relied, ""I don't believe I'm familiar with that one.""  I remember removing myself and heading to the storage closet I had seen filled with British candies. I found a box of After Eight thin mints and devoured the entire box.  These items were not available in Cuba as there were no stores to buy them in.  A short time later Mr. Cleaver and I departed.

What was NOT mentioned in this documentary is the fact that he was in Cuba at all. His wife Kathleen talks about how Eldridge left the US for Algeria. Not true! I am the person who got him to Algeria! No one has ever reported the truth about Cleaver in Cuba. He was not welcomed with open arms by the Castro government. In fact, he never met Fidel. The government gave him a modest apartment with a cook and it was the meeting place for the Panther brothers who were living in Cuba and also visiting members of SDS and other militant groups. The word got out fairly quickly that these young people were bringing in marijuana as a gift to Eldridge.  I didn't indulge so I was never invited to visit when they were there.

Eldridge wanted to set up a Black Panther office in Havana, and was shocked and angry when he was told there was no need for such an entity in Cuba. As time went on he became more and more depressed about his situation. His wife Kathleen was expecting a baby in California and he was in Cuba. One night he reached a breaking point and became violent. I asked him if he wanted me to find someone who could get him out of Cuba. He said, 'Please!'  He told me he wanted to go to Algeria. I told him I knew a British correspondent with Reuters but didn't know if he was in a position to help him. He asked me to bring him to his apartment. He knew that in order to get help he would have to give him an interview which would expose the fact he was living in Cuba to the US Government. He didn't care. He wanted out.  That is how Eldridge got to Algeria.

When he did return stateside, he gave an interview to The Rolling Stone magazine.  He mentioned me in the story and called me 'Kitty' and not by my real name, Bunnye.  He called me a 'power f-----' because he thought I had a personal relationship with Dr. Castro. A lot of people thought that but it wasn't true at all. I still have that article somewhere in my archives.

He moved to Algeria and I eventually made my way to London to live and work.  Word got out through my friends at BBC News (I had met them in Cuba) that there was an American girl living in London who had just spent a year in Cuba, had met Dr. Castro and had spoken at-length with him.  I was 27 at the time. An Irish newspaper did an in-depth story on me which started the ball rolling with regard to publications wanting interviews. I did not grant anyone else access. One and done.  I was not a publicity seeker.

Young Americans living in Europe started a publication writing stories about revolutionary men and women living in exile, and they wanted me to give them an exclusive about Eldridge in Havana.  I told them exactly what I am writing here and they turned scarlet with embarrassment. ""We can't print THAT!"" the young New Yorker said to me.  Why not? It's the truth. ""I'm sure it is, but we can't write anything NEGATIVE about revolutionaries!"" This was over lunch, by the way. He paid for it with his US credit card and bragged he was maxing it out and had no intention of ever paying it off. I called his type (wealthy New Yorker, parents left-leaning Communist/Socialist) Credit Card Commies.  He was not amused.

I eventually returned to the States. Had a daughter, worked 48 years, retired. I have acquired so many memories from the 60s and 70s. You can imagine how shocked I was watching this documentary when Kathleen Cleaver skipped her husband's Cuban exile entirely.  Now you have the real story.",1508803200,3,6538,4.376344086021505

7456236,5,B01648P6IM,"i think that i am very lucky, in that i seem to have grown up in a bubble for most of my life.  racism was *a thing of the past* in the world in which i lived.  we, my brother and i, were taught to love everyone, no matter what.  we were taught to treat everyone with respect, and fairness.  we were taught that some people do bad things, but that this had no thing, whatsoever to do with one's skin color.

when i grew up and moved out of my bubble, it was shocking to that there are still places in this country that won't serve non white people.  that a young person can walk into an establishment and ask for a job ap, and be told that they aren't hiring....until the next person who walks in, who is white and asks.

i have watched businesses give promotions to someone who is black or mexican...even though they aren't qualified for the position, and meanwhile there is someone at the place of business who IS qualified to do the job, and nonwhite....just so that they  can say *see..affirmative action is racist and it doesn't work*

i have read some of the reviews (here and on netflix), and it is sad to me that someone can give a 1 star review without even watching the program.  it is ironic to me that people who are crying about movements like blm, and the black panthers...while they are so vehemently trying to protect the 2nd amendment and the right to free speech.

i think the thing that struck me the hardest in this documentary was when the man said that mlk jr was their champion, and once we killed him..this man who was trying to come at the racism situation, with a mind of peace...he was trying to bridge the gap....and we shot him....and from then on he had no use for us, and it was the reason the panthers took the turn that they did

i also think the idea that the fbi was pitting members and their followers against each other, was interesting.  right now...i feel like we are in a time where *SOMEONE* is pitting each major political party against each other, and i can't exactly figure out who it is, why it is, or who benefits from it....but it feels like that.

it has been my mission to soak up information on what black america thinks they are being treated like..why they feel this way...and instead of rolling my eyes and saying *well that's not the way to handle things*...i am trying to imagine myself in a situation where i feel so much pressure just to be alive...in a world that truly goes out of its way to still place a boot on my chest....and i think, well maybe i would react that way too...we can't know.  and then i try to act in a way that demonstrates that i am sorry.  i am sorry for the big things that have happened historically...and i am sorry for the big and small things that happen now...i am sorry if i say the wrong thing, or do the wrong thing..or come across as ignorant.

i want for us all to get along....please be patient with me, because while i am more than happy to be dethroned from this position of white power and privilege that i have unwittingly and undeservedly taken advantage of for my 42 years of living...i think that some people are fearful of the loss that comes with realizing that the color of our skins should afford us no luxury.  it makes no sense...and when i see fb posts, or tweets, or blogs that talk about *what white people do*...in a way that feels like we are being called out or demeaned...i will do my best to remember, that perhaps we deserve it a little, maybe not as individuals, but collectively.  i promise you, i very much wish to do my part to make things better, and i really hope that people will continue to produce movies and documentaries that will allow me to open my eyes to as many versions of your story that i can.",1494892800,,3727,4.306151645207439

7456275,5,B01648P6IM,"As an example of the documentary form, ""Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution"" effectively blends archival footage with the reminisces of participants and the observations of historians - a good mix of the real thing along with the talking heads to explain it.  Leaders such as Huey Newton, Eldridge Cleaver, and Bobby Seale are presented, and the Panthers' motivations - housing, education, and an end to discrimination and police brutality - are made clear.  The film may annoy partisans on both sides, as it is neither critical nor adulatory of the Panthers.  J. Edgar Hoover is also presented dispassionately in his use of COINTELPRO.  The information is presented, and the viewer invited to draw their own conclusions.

What's interesting is that despite the threats of violence, the Panthers were far more often the recipients than the perpetrators.  The present-day ""Black Lives Matter"" movement has been called terroristic, but in comparison with the Panthers, they're fairly sedate.  The film describes how men took advantage of California's open-carry laws, to follow the police (at a respectful distance) while carrying rifles and shotguns in plain sight.  BLM hasn't attempted anything even remotely similar to that, and I invite anyone reading this to speculate what the reaction would be if they did.",1460246400,7,1319,5.3076923076923075

7456292,4,B01648P6IM,"BLACK PANTHERS is a salutary piece that should be shown as a reminder to every politician past and present that racism is alive and regrettably flourishing throughout the United States.  Perhaps they should bear this fact in mind before making racist and inflammatory statements in their campaign speeches.

With the help of extensive archive footage plus first-hand reminiscences from those involved, Stanley Nelson's documentary tells the story of a movement that grew out of the Civil Rights Movement but favored more active forms of intervention.  Protests might be kept largely peaceful - at least in the early years - but members of the movement were quite prepared to carry weapons, especially in California, where a loophole in the law allowed them to do so.  The overwhelmingly white police force took strong exception to this, but there was little they could do within the confines of the law ... except to beat up miscreants in the name of preserving the peace.

Ideologically speaking, the Black Panthers had a lot in common with the liberation movements that sprung up all over Africa during the Sixties.  Many nations freed themselves at length from the shackles of colonial rule: the Black Panthers wanted to do the same for African Americans within the USA.  They garnered considerable support from within the African continent, and managed to attract a huge following for their various demonstrations.  The media found some of them highly attractive with their Afro hairstyles and alternative modes of dress through which they expressed their unique identities.

In a chilling reminder of the anti-Communist movement two decades previously, the government - especially under Richard Nixon - tried to limit the Black Panthers' activities through the work of J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI.  Although not exactly described as such, his determine to root out so-called ""subversives"" reeked of an anticommunist witch-hunt, taking place in a country that publicly speaking liked to proclaim its commitment to democratic values.

Perhaps the document was a tad one-sided, as it tended to concentrate on the Panthers' commitment to eradicate racism while not exploring some of its more violent tactics.  But then perhaps they could be justified; the days of the African American passively turning the other cheek or peacefully resisting in a manner prescribed by Martin Luther King were long gone.

My first memory of the Black Panther movement and its significance came at the 1968 Olympics, when the African American Tommie Smith raised his hand in the movement's salute just after he had received a gold medal.  Although the television companies tried to make light of the incident, it was a clear indication of how the movement had become part of the mainstream rather than remaining on the margins.",1458691200,3,2810,5.188053097345133

7456326,5,B01648P6IM,"What the establishment did to undermine the Black Panthers is deplorable and a violation of the UN's Convention of Human Rights.  J.Edgar Hoover was a white supremacist who used his power as FBI director to direct a dirty war against the Black Panthers.  The police officers who participated at the behest of the FBI are equally as culpable for simply following orders.  That may or may not have committed a crime is a real question, that being said, those who get to police, charge, prosecute, and account for that are not trustworthy and they lost any and all credibility.

7456327,5,B01648P6IM,"Powerful and enlightning! Its fascinating to hear and see reactions of society today when any word of Black Panthers is mentioned. An underappreciated and remarkable group, we could use a self defense group today without question. Pro-black does not equate to being Anti-white.",1456099200,10,277,5.465116279069767

7456330,5,B01648P6IM,"Just finished watching this on PBS and was glad amazon carries this dvd for purchase. Finally, the truth about this movement. A group who simply wanted equality and deserved it. What a shameful era in America about the treatment of Black American citizens. Recently we have heard about Beyonce's dance routine referring to this movement. Whatever you believe and if the dance was actually about Black Empowerment it was really symbolizing equality. Black lives matter, White lives matter, etc....Human lives just matter! With all the recent innocent police shootings and brutality against people of color, it gives reason to protest or symbolism. Those who do not understand it, check this dvd out and put yourself in the shoes of those who walked in this era. It's unfortunate that the ""few"" crooked people today in law enforcement cause so much separation. The riots in Maryland was an unacceptable protest but those affected wanted to gain national and world attention. There are definitely peaceful means to capture attention but the people who were being oppressed were at wits end. Great educational video.",1455926400,17,1112,5.183333333333334

7456332,5,B01648P6IM,"I saw this when it aired on PBS and thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.  The journalist interviews former Black Panther leaders, former police officials and does an excellent job of chronicling the rise and fall of the Black Panthers.  I learned things that I previously did not know and it was shocking to see how external forces instigated internal conflicts.  Don't believe everything you hear about the Panthers on the news. Hate them or love them, these were mostly teenagers taking a stand against injustices during that time. It's almost 50 years after the Black Panther party was created and their impact is still very relevant today.",1455667200,33,643,5.047169811320755

8735581,5,B01648P6IM,I had to watch this documentary for a cultural history class. I find it intriguing how history has so many different perspectives. This documentary started with the different ways the Black Panthers are perceived. I think it leaves out a lot because it's only one perspective that shares the story. That being said it's definitely informational and really awesome to hear from people who played Major roles in the Black Panther Party.,1535760000,,434,5.041666666666667
