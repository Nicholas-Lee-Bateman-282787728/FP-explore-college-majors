We also really enjoy the animation.  The kids want to play it all the time and they love to get up and dance along with classics like ""Hokey Pokey"" and ""I'm a Little Teapot.""  It is great to see them so thoroughly engaged and also active at the same time.  We are picky about what we let them see on TV, but we feel they get so much from this that we let them watch it pretty often.  We were especially touched when our daughter used her birthday money from grandparents to buy herself a toy guitar and brought it right home to play along with Susie and friends.  We've enjoyed the DVD so much at our house that we bought several extra to give as gifts to other kids in our lives.",1317600000,,842,4.122699386503068
4593414,5,B00571VY9I,"This DVD is so great! My Daughter loves to watch it every morning (and it keeps her entertained whilst I wake up!!!). There is a real mix of new songs I've never heard, and classics. The graphics are wonderful and each song has a different location/theme. You and your kids will love it!",1315180800,,287,4.433962264150943
4593415,5,B00571VY9I,"The DVD ""Come On Let's Go"" is so great !!  Susie Tallman mixes many types of children's music into one bundle of fun and she sings and dances with children helping her vocally and visually.  Her choices range from an elegant tea party singing ""I'm a Little Tea Pot"" with youngsters surrounded by delectable treats to watching ""5 Little Speckled Frogs"" eating delicious flies.  The title song will get your children - and you - on your feet with its joyful beat and message.  And to rest listen to a soft, sweet ""Lavender's Blue"".  Don't miss this one.  It will make a perfect gift on any occasion, or 'just because'.",1314230400,2,616,4.554545454545455

4593417,5,B00571VY9I,"We have been huge Susie Tallman fans for years, so it was very exciting to put this DVD in and see Susie (and her friends) singing and dancing to many of our favorites. She is as authentic and talented on screen as she is with her music. My children love to watch and sing along. They have their favorite songs, but all the music videos are fabulous and fun.  We've given the DVD to many friends as gifts - and they all love it too! Susie Tallman continues to shine!",1313452800,,466,4.177777777777778
8460196,5,B00571VY9I,"This is the cutest DVD to accompany the CD of ""Let's GO!"" And my four year old absolutely loves it! Susie could not be more adorable and the rest of the cast (including all the children) are great too. We just love this and plan to buy a copy for all our friends with kids for their upcoming birthdays!",1466121600,,302,4.135593220338983

THANKS FOR THE GREAT PRODUCTS

8460198,5,B00571VY9I,"This DVD is perfect for our music loving two year old! M has began trying to sing, and now that we have watched it a few times, he has hit that 'favorite movie roll' that most kids go through and all we hear all day when the show stops is ""Susie! Susie"" as he signs 'more' at the tv! Susie Tallman, you are quite the rock star in our house!",1430784000,,340,3.8714285714285714
8460199,5,B00571VY9I,Wonderful and entertaining for the young ones! Loved by all ! Good clean fun and a learning item !,1421971200,,98,4.2105263157894735
8460200,5,B00571VY9I,My daughter got this for her birthday. She has had it a week and has seen it several times a day. She LOVES it!,1364169600,,111,3.6666666666666665
8460201,4,B00571VY9I,The first viewing my 2 and 1/2 year old twins were not that into it. Now we have to watch it everyday. The songs are well done and the title track is very catchy. There is only one or two slow songs. The editing is not perfect but the kids would never notice. And there is one strange (person) in some of the videos but I would definately recommend this for children ages 1-4. I am going to buy the CD for car rides.,1362355200,,416,3.9642857142857144
8460202,5,B00571VY9I,"My toddler loves this DVD.  He has zero interest in TV, except for this DVD.  I'll play the DVD on a weekend morning (when my wife is sleeping in) and he loves it so much that it gives me time to feed the dogs and fish, pour a cup of coffee and then sit down and watch my son dance to the music.  We're going to be taking a road trip in a few weeks and I can honestly say that we wouldn't even consider taking a road trip with a toddler without the DVD.  Thanks Susie!",1355788800,,468,3.7938144329896906
8460203,5,B00571VY9I,"I can't say enough good things about Susie's work!  Her CDs are fantastic, and have traveled with us on many a car ride.  They are the perfect combination of fun (for the kids) and great singing (for the adults).

I was equally thrilled with her DVD, ""Come On, Let's Go!""  My 5 year old son liked it as much as his 15 month old cousin.  The songs and skits are varied.  The music is not auto-tuned to the point of inducing headaches.  And I love that my children will dance when they hear the first beat.

I bought a CD for every child in our family this year.  I'm saving the DVD for birthdays! :-)",1354838400,,599,4.139130434782609
8460204,5,B00571VY9I,Most of the time my daughter sits and watches TV! She doesn't move a muscle!  Put this DVD in and she is up and dancing!  I would highly recommend this DVD!,1335139200,2,156,4.0
8460205,5,B00571VY9I,"I found out about this video from seeing Susie Tallman's songs on PBS when my son watches Curious George episodes.  My son, Josh is turning 2 and the video is for him.  He absolutely LOVES the songs!  He dances and sings, well attempts to sing along with them.  I think the music is great and it has brought so much joy to my son.",1333584000,3,330,4.109375
