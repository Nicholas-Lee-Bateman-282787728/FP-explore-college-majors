But its not bad, good camera views and you can see the hole cards. Buy it you will enjoy about 20 hours of WPT poker. GOOD LUCK!",1112227200,15,277,4.245283018867925

8027152,5,B0002EJ83Y,"In 2003, World Poker Tour hit TV. What followed was the biggest poker boom in the history of the sport. From 2003-2006, poker had a meteoric rise-(from 839 entrants in the 03' World Series Of Poker to 8773 entrants in 06'). Obviously, when Party Poker closed their doors to American players in 2006, the Poker Boom started to die. And with ""Black Friday"" hitting the online poker world on the 15th of April in 2011, the poker boom in America is officially over.

This DVD set takes us back to the good old days of poker when that boom was just getting started. On the first disc alone, of this 5-disc set, we see Gus Hansen, John Juanda, Freddy Deeb, Scotty Nguyen, Phil Gordon, Jennifer Harman and Phil Hellmuth. These are the best of the best, and watching them play inspired millions to do the same. The production values are brilliant, Sexton and Van Patten are very good commentators-(though Van Patten with his ""Wired Pairs"" get a bit annoying) and the beautiful Shana Hiatt is always good to see. This is simply a must get if you are a poker fan.

I type this review on the 30-January-2012, and I hope that when you read this in the future, Black Friday is nothing but a memory, and Americans-(and the whole world) have a large and legitimate selection of online poker sites to choose from again.

Get this 5-disc set and reminisce.",1327795200,2,1339,4.547717842323651

8027154,5,B0002EJ83Y,"Sure Moneymaker won the WSOP in 2003 and folks heard of it, but it wasn't until the Travel channel started to show the World Poker Tour on TV that the Poker Boom started.
Very well produced live shows of Poker, excellent stuff, sadly only complete seasons 1-2 and a ""Best"" of season 3 has been released on DVD, own them all!",1253750400,,324,4.327868852459017

8027158,5,B0002EJ83Y,"In WPT Season I, we have the broadcast that we now love in its embryo stage. It arrived just before the full-fledged poker boom, and the tournaments shown are smaller, and their prizes smaller, than the ones we now know. Just as one would expect, Mike Sexton is present with all his syrupy enthusiasm and Vince Van Patton plays his model sidekick throughout. Interestingly, Shana Hiatt has a more wholesome, brunette appearance. Of course, with a face like hers, it's impossible to ever look bad. If you recall, it was Hiatt who gave us the wonderful quote, ""I like a real man. Not a pretty boy who looks in the mirror longer than me and who shaves his body."" Bravo, you're hired!--at least on my team. Anyway, the only difference in quality with the first season episodes and what we have now is that they do not yet show in boxes next to the cards onscreen the probabilities for each player's winning. For me, the statistics have been a highly helpful educational guide to better play; just as watching the videos have. If I were you, I'd consider buying this one from the z shop. It's half the price and I've never had any problem with any of their used copies in the past. One last thing, forward to the Hollywood championships just to see the blitzed Layne Flack at the final table. Why would anybody drink like that before a tournament? Men the Master looks like he was emptying the bottle with him. It's actually a riot because Flack, after showing Men his cards, humiliates Lakers owner, Jerry Buss, heads up. All the while, Sexton and Van Patton pull a Sergeant Schultz and see nothing.",1125273600,8,1595,4.580419580419581
