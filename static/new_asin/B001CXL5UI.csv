8290340,4,B001CXL5UI,"Well, finally.  For those of us who grew up in the years prior to and during the introduction of TV, afternoon after school was not complete without joining Bat Masterson for some quick, fast action, all in black and white (colour TV, whatever do you mean?) and always, but always, on the side of the righteous.  With his slick card moves and even slicker fight moves, Bat Masterson shaped many lives in those far off times, and always for the good.  In a world still comming to terms from the effects of the 2nd World War and the Korean conflict, he was an escape into a safe world where good always won.  I could still remember the theme song, which i sang to my questioning grandchildren, and was overjoyed to find out that Bat Masterson was now available on DVD.  So there he struts once more, blazing a trail across the west, in all his original glory, for a new generation to enjoy.  Thank you, God, for archives and digital format.  Seriously, if you want a great western series with a polish and aplomb not allways seen today, get your copy now.",1296432000,2,1053,4.453125
8290341,1,B001CXL5UI,The DVD's are not nearly as sharp as the ones being shown on the Encore Western Cable channel.  The DVD's I received have a washed out buzzy look.  I would say that the service and delivery time was great though.,1229904000,17,212,4.275
8290342,5,B001CXL5UI,"I am hooked on TV Westerns and I really don't remember Bat Masterson but since watching cable I have come to Love The series. AKA ""Gene Barry"" is just too cool.",1228089600,3,160,4.193548387096774
8290343,5,B001CXL5UI,"This is an excellent show that has only improved with age.  I loved this show as a kid and now that I can clearly understand the episodes. I love them even more so. The show took a tongue-in-cheek outlook, with Barry's Masterson dressed in expensive Eastern clothing and preferring to use his cane rather than a gun to get himself out of trouble (also the case with the real Masterson), hence the nickname ""Bat."" Masterson was also portrayed as a ladies' man who traveled the West looking for women and adventure. The black derby, fancy vest, black jacket, and elegant cane were his trademarks (and were widely marketed in miniature to child viewers as tie-in products during the run of the show).

Barry went on to star in Burke's Law, a detective series set in modern-day Los Angeles, as well as The Name of the Game, a series in which he alternated the lead with Tony Franciosa and Robert Stack, and appeared in most of his episodes with newcomer Susan Saint James.

Barry recreated the role of Bat Masterson in an episode of the television series Guns of Paradise (1990), alongside Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp, and again in 1991 in The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw, also with O'Brian as Earp, as well as Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick and Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie",1227484800,9,1278,4.5964912280701755
