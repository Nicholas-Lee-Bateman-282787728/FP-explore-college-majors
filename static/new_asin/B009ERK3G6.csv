5322452,5,B009ERK3G6,"I love the innocent, clean characters of the stories. Shocking to see so much crime in such a small city! :-)  Since I am learning Italian, this is a very enjoyable way to learn the language and see how the language is used.",1402617600,,224,4.209302325581396
5322453,5,B009ERK3G6,"Great acting and love to hear the Italian.  Truly an amazing series.  I would recommend it for the story, actor as well as the gorgeous scenary.",1387238400,,144,4.5
5322454,4,B009ERK3G6,"You can't find a series like this on American TV. It is a sweet tale about a parish priest in Italy.  All the characters are broadly drawn but so Italian.  Don Matteo solves murders and family problems -- a little like ""Murder She Wrote"".  Production values are not as slick as American series but that makes it even better.
It is in Italian with English subtitles.",1374969600,,365,4.5
5322455,5,B009ERK3G6,"We love this series!  The plots, cast of characters, costumes, and settings in Sicily are very entertaining.  We are working on Set 3 and have Set 4 ready to go.",1366243200,,161,4.333333333333333
5322456,5,B009ERK3G6,"I have all the Don Matteo DVD sets available here in the US.  I like it very much, not only it is well done and the episodes are interesting, the actors excellent, but there are no vulgarities or obscenities in these series, as unfortunately abound on the popular Detective Montalbano and the Young Montalbano series.

I and my friends hope the following episodes which are available in Italy will be made for use in the USA.

5322457,4,B009ERK3G6,"This set is part of the second season - 8 episodes - and third in comparison to the other three sets in story quality. Set 3 is best, followed closely by set1 with set 2 well behind the other three. The visuals also lag behind set 3 (1st half of season2). I live in Italy and have watched all 8 seasons and it has been a ""hit"" series during its run. Terence Hill was in his early 70s during its last season but looked younger.

I have enjoyed watching all of the episodes again, in fact looked forward to seeing them again. Father Matteo is treated with respect as a religious character. His actions are faith-based as he moves through each mysterious crime. season three had 24 episodes, not 16 as did 1 and 2, and I hope they will be available soon in one purchase. I will be a buyer!",1360368000,,786,4.2052980132450335
5322458,5,B009ERK3G6,"We got hooked on Don Mateo last year by accident. 'thought it was weird with a priest in an old town in Italy living with a couple of retarded people.  Then we found that the priest had a very special knack of being intuitive and the ""retards"" had a very special personalities a few pieces of which we recognized in ourselves.

There always a crime being committed, but Dom Mateo always has in his heart to extend help out to the perpetrator with the reminder that the man above has him included in his future.  A very refreshing program to the usual squat in TV.",1434067200,,563,4.3428571428571425
