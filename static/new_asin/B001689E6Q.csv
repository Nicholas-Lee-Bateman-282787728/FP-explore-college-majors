I prefer the whole atmosphere of the Japanese events MUCH better; the energy in the arenas was electric and you didn't have the camera panning onto fake-looking people (fake tans, bling clothes and jewellery) in the audience. Obviously the matches are what is important, but I really miss the Pride FC in Japan. A great one to get is Pride 10 Return of the Warriors---plenty of respect between the fighters, great (sometimes brutal) matches, and the audience appreciates the whole show so much---they're not there just to be seen. The Pride mystique was lost when it was americanized, but this one is worth it for the exciting matches.",1428883200,,660,4.901785714285714
8261527,5,B001689E6Q,"This is a MUST own for any true fan of MMA!  I haven't seen all of the Pride events, but this is without a doubt the best one I have ever seen.  In fact, this is one of the best complete cards I have EVER seen regardless of organization!  Every fight is action packed and even the undercard, lesser known fighters put on great fights with crazy knockouts!  One of the BEST FIGHTS IN THE HISTORY OF MMA is on this DVD!  Anyone who hasn't seen the N.Diaz versus T.Gnomi fight is robbing themselves!  This was a back and forth striking and grappling battle that was finished in exciting fashion!  This DVD is worth EVERY penny!!!",1344902400,,626,4.344827586206897
8261528,5,B001689E6Q,"Many sites have called this card the best PRIDE event ever and the Gomi/Diaz fight the best fight ever. While I give the first title to PRIDE 14 and the second title to Diego Sanchez/Joe Stevenson at UFC 95, you will not be dissappointed by the quality of this event. Several quick knockouts and a few extremely tight submissions on this DVD; only one fight goes to a decision. The full card is:
Joachim Hansen/Jason Ireland
Kazuo Misaki/Frank Trigg
Travis Wiuff/James Lee
Antonio Rogerio Nogueira/Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou
Hayato Sakurai/Mac Danzig
Sergey Kharitonov/Mike Russow
Mauricio Rua/Alistair Overeem
Takanori Gomi/Nick Diaz
MIDDLEWEIGHT (205) CHAMPIONSHIP: Wanderlei Silva/Dan Henderson

There is something for everyone on this card, and it is well worth the purchase. For those who complain about the lack of fighter entrances, they are on the DVD, just in the special features.",1280448000,3,888,5.3428571428571425
8261529,5,B001689E6Q,"This is IMO the best Pride event I've seen and one of the best MMA events I've seen. It's too bad it came at the end of Pride as an MMA Org.

Takanori Gomi vs. Nick Diaz is in my top 5 fights ever, the action is back and forth throughout with each guy taking some of the others best shots. It ends with a rare submission after one of the fighters runs out of gas. Great fight.

Wanderlei Silva vs. Dan Henderson is a very good fight another that has great back and forth action with a brutal KO ending.

Hayato Sakurai vs Mac Danzig is another very good fight with a great ending. This card also includes one of Frank Trigg's better fights against Kazuo Misaki and this event also introduced most MMA fans to Sokoudjou with his first of two big upsets.

If you're an MMA fan even if you're a casual one I highly recommend buying this DVD. You shouldn't be disappointed top to bottom this is a great event.",1243036800,,905,4.183908045977011
8261530,4,B001689E6Q,"yeah, i know, Wanderlei was knocked out,  but it was still a great event held in the States.  the match between Gomi and Diaz is worth twice the price alone!",1231286400,,157,4.2
8261531,4,B001689E6Q,"I was very happy when I received the DVD, because of reviews I have read. The entire event was exciting, living up to the hype and the DVD itself has no problems.",1222646400,,162,4.09375
8261532,4,B001689E6Q,"The Diaz/Gomi match, despite the post fight controversy, ranks as the most dramatic MMA match that I have ever seen. Throw in the Henderson/Silva match and this ranks as one of the best shows by any organization ever. Not impressed by Nick Diaz? You will be after seeing his heart against Gomi.",1211068800,3,294,4.673076923076923
8261533,5,B001689E6Q,"Antonio ""Rodrigo"" Nogueira is one of the top HWs in MMA (most rank him at No. 2 behind Fedor, who's in danger of losing his position at the top of the food chain after more than two years without facing a quality HW opponent). His brother, Antonio ""Rogerio"" Nogueira, is the LHW who was shockingly KO'd by Sokodju at Pride 33. Just to clear that up.

Finally, the later Pride events are making it to DVD. The Silva-Henderson fight alone is worth the price. All of you new MMA and UFC fans, check out the Pride events. You won't be disappointed.",1210550400,,544,4.3861386138613865
8261534,5,B001689E6Q,"What can I say.  Being in the 3rd row was insane.  This show has it all---knock outs, subs, and one decision by Trigg.  Sokoudjou turned heads.  Gomi vs Diaz was the fight of 2007 according to many.  Shogun, Hellboy.  Mac Danzig vs Sakurai---WOw.  Henso vs Wand---yikes.  The PPV showed the complete show from beginning to end.
This is an event that marked the end of Pride in the USA, and in general, as 34 was nowhere near the level of this event.

A must buy for any MMA fan.",1209945600,8,478,4.280898876404494
