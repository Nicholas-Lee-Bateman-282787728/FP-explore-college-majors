8478237,2,B005LKH76E,"The Boy She Met Online is an originally made for TV in 2010 movie. Basically an attractive gets good grades high school student (Tracy Spiridakos) with an overprotective smother mother (Alexandra Paul) who won't let her get a job or do what most teenage kids do, meets a guy online who she thinks is a college student. This guy is the freedom she desires and obviously her soul mate, even though she's never actually met him. However as we the viewer know, he's an inmate chatting to her on a prison computer.  You're probably expecting a thriller of some kind, maybe something along the lines of Fear, but really other than being the first thing the daughter finally stands up to her mother about which stresses out her mother more and more, who wants her to be five years old forever and still her best friend. The movie doesn't really do much before a ridiculous ending, where you're just thinking, how dumb are all these characters.  It's also the same ending you've seen in countless TV movies, many of which have Alexandra Paul in them playing the exact same mother character.

I realise prison isn't as hard core as it is in most movies, but this one seemed like it was a summer camp.  The guy is in prison for a violent armed robbery where a shop assistant was beaten to death for not handing over a measly $1000.  Yet at this summer camp prisoner's aren't even monitored online, they can chat to and seduce school children and no one puts a stop to it, notifies the victim or seems to even notice it.  Likewise you can use the prison phone (without the operator like most movies telling you an inmate from whatever prison is making a collect call, instead she just says the end part do you accept a collect call from and he yells his name.  Seriously even not knowing a guy is in prison, is a guy going to seem like a great catch if he needs to make collect calls to you a high school student.

The characters really weren't that interesting.  The most interesting character was the guy the ex con lived with, but he doesn't have much screen time.",1479340800,,2056,4.461333333333333

8478239,5,B005LKH76E,I  saw this movie on tv last weekend it was on lifetime. I thought it was a very good movie. As I was watching I started thinking about my granddaughter. I really felt like she should be watching it. She is 11 but wants to be 20. The more I watched the more I wished she could be watching. ( They were at the zoo)  I could really see her as the young girl in the movie .The movie to me could be a good tool for teaching young girls about getting involved with men on the internet. It showed how he lied to her & how him being in her life affected her & her mothers relationship. Among other things. I would want a parent to watch it with their daughter so they could bring things to her attention and get the most out of the movie .I highly recommend this movie. As usual I found it at Amazon........!!!!!!!  I won't tell any more  about it because I don't  want to spoil it for anyone that might want to see it & hasn't yet.,1427328000,,925,3.9783783783783786
