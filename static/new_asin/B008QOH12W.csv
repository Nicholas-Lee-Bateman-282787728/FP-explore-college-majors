8529725,3,B008QOH12W,"I wasn't really sure what to expect. The first DVD was interesting and gave a lot of cool history, but the second disk was strange. They had music from other bands in the background. It was very strange, and rather boring.",1482796800,,222,4.439024390243903
8529726,5,B008QOH12W,Muse is perhaps the most under rated band in America. It's sad how our youth idolizes Katy Perry and Justin Bieber and ignore real talent like these guys. Well lucky for them the rest of the world knows it. Long Live Muse!,1403222400,6,222,4.309523809523809
8529727,1,B008QOH12W,"This was not licensed by Muse and it shows. The production values of this film are so low that the title menu just has a static picture with three options.  No music in the background and no animated background (as one may imagine would be present in a modern day documentary).  There are no interviews with the band about their career, music, or lives.  There are people that came into contact with them that tell the story throughout and it comes off as extremely boring.  I am excited about the fact that Muse may one day release an official documentary however this is not that film.  I will be returning this item and would suggest that no self respecting Muse fan ever buy this.",1358208000,26,684,4.483870967741935
8529728,4,B008QOH12W,"I really enjoyed this because it gave me a lot of information about Muse that I had not known.
It gives their history from the small town in England all the way up to and including the beginning
of the Resistance. It's funny because one if them thought The Resistance would not be as big as
their former album. They all roundly agree that Muse will be one of the great international groups
and that they have very little in common with Radiohead besides a great singer.",1356912000,5,469,4.402298850574713
