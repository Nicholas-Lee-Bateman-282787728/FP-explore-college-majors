8090747,4,B000BPK28O,"This dvd, I actually liked. The newbie female to the debris section from the first movie wasn't acting cartoonish. I am considering buying number six.",1394582400,,150,5.04
8090748,4,B000BPK28O,"In 2075, man dwells in space as well as on the Earth. Space debris has become a dangerous reality. Ai Tanabe is a young lady who has come to space to collect and dispose of this dangerous debris. She meets veteran debris collector, Hoshino. Together with their friends, they keep space travelers and residents safe. As time goes by, the 2 fall in love with each other. It's harder to do a dangerous job with the one you love waiting and praying for your safety.

This anime is really good. It has action, drama, comedy, Sci-fi/adventure, and a bit of romance. It's pretty stacked. The animation and voice actors are good as well. I'm really surprised that this anime isn't more well known. The 1 thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is the depth of the story. The story backgrounds the characters well, but there is a little too much wasted time on goofiness I think. If that time were used to develop the romance between Ai and Hoshino more, This series could have been incredible. This series does have a very satisfying ending though. Overall, this anime is a joy to watch. I highly recommend it to anime fans of any genre.",1354406400,,1140,4.480769230769231
8090749,3,B000BPK28O,"But the beginning first few DvDs where great Science Fiction. I love how at lest one artist (Moonlight Mile)showed how Truly messed up muslims are when they follow the koran to the letter in conviction and the consequences thereafter in the death of innocent people for it. The man you see on the cover was what I call an ""raghead"" in mentality, but in this story it was {of course!} Eveell Americanos that suppressed the ""innocent"" third worlders by hogging all of lady gaia's precious resources for itself...

So why aren't we raping and pillaging Haiti. Declaring it now conquered and under the jackboots of it new Americano overlords? Ask a Kurd about them nasty Americans lately?

Sadly, '60s ~ '80s mentality invade many great stories made in Japan where the Big Bad Baddies are forever Americans from 'Appleseed' - 'Ghost in the Shell' - 'Silent Service' - 'Zipang!' - 'Grave of the Firefly' -'Planetes' and so forth. Heck even when a well read Manga writer draws the sordid details of Japans past like the Raping of Nanking, he is censured by his own readers and later company! To this day I wished I didn't just put it down and not buy that Monthly in Japan because I never saw it again. It was never compiled in the ""takubans""(volumes) that all manga usual do too!

Buy the first four and last one for a Completely great bit of science fiction, you can skip the fifth without losing a bit.",1265155200,,1399,4.610441767068273
8090750,5,B000BPK28O,"With this volume, the divergences between the manga and the anime reach a new level -- one which doesn't detract from either version of the story.

Hachimaki up and quits from the Debris Section because he feels the need to focus himself completely upon his goal of landing a spot on the exploration ship going to Jupiter, and this causes friction between him and his friends.  Cheng-Shin also applies to the mission, but as one of Technora's in-house applicants, while Tanabe struggles with Hachi's decision because he made it unilaterally, not discussing any of it with her.

Although Hachi appears strong and committed to his friends, he must deal with his inner demons as the grueling competition for the Jupiter expedition drags on -- but with his goal constantly in front of him, Hachi is confident that he will overcome any and all obstacles . . . but at what cost?

Hachi, however, is not the only one hiding things, as one of those undergoing the trials for the Jovian mission has much more nefarious secrets, and Hachi's ex-girlfriend Claire, now demoted from the elite Control Section to the pariah Debris Section, gets implicated in a terrorist plot to sabotage the Jupiter exploration mission.

The high production values which Planetes began with continue right up to the end, and even though the story ventures into areas unexplored in the manga, the writing retains its high quality, as well, and psychological isolation is added to the already long list of dangers to astronauts even as the political and economic debates over space exploration gain even more emphasis.

If you've made it this far, there is no reason not to continue supporting this excellent show; you won't regret it.",1144713600,2,1703,4.916376306620209
