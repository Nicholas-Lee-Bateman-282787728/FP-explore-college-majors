496126,3,6302676835,"Lets just say that Hammer's Dracula films were never on par with their(Terence Fisher's) Frankenstein films. And this film is proof positive evidence in Hammers all to soon delcine in the dracula cycle-already with the third entry! This time it's Freddie Francis who sits in the director chair(Fisher wasn't aviable due to health poblems)whom with his strong visula sense-but lack of building from his material and subtect it what drownes the film. Not only that,but Francis fails what Fisher conveyed so beautifully prior to his 2 preddeccors-The thesipan glow of repressed sensuality of Dracula's victorian victims--which in here--is total non-exsistent. And what u get is a bunch of annoying, rather boring foreground charcters-who seem to be occupied in some love circle that tends to stray from the whole basic plot of the film-which is not so sucessfully churned out by Fancis, who does(give the guy some credit) try to come to a engulfing, intresting  lovestory--but it's a rather hit n' miss-that and the fact what alot of what Francis was trying to get into it was left on the cutting room floor....or so they tell us. Christopher Lee as usual is criminally wasted and is forced to resort to his standard hissing, only mutering a few lines. Which is more than he did in the previous film(Drac:Prince of Darkness)-which adds nothing to his character with him destined to stay that one-dimensinal Count-that he would soon be reduced to--give or take another entry. Aside from Lee , the performances arn't that bad. Their not great, but decent to say the least...most notable is Rupert Davis's Priest, who by all means pulls out the best perfomance. On a visulal standpoint--the film plays on a higher scale-due to an icreased budget-who Hammer by this time was out of their money dilemma providing enlarged back drops and settings--with a much more spacy feel to it, not at all cramped like Drac:Prince of Darkness. The films camerwork is styistically dynamic(not surprising for a Freddie Francis flm) and though while Arthur Grants compostion is very well composed, enhaced by amber fliters that were inplied in the lenses--it's NOT Fisher's ""cinematic exercise"" full of master framing and compostion that is most lieky evident is his Drac: prince of Darkness) as well as his Tour de force Horror of Dracula(1958)and James Bernard's film score sounds a bit on the peachy side this time around-not only that but it disregards Dracula's main theme-one would have to wait for the next entry before they would here it again--for this was the only entry thats it's' abscent. All n' all Dracula Has Risen from the Grave is a good average effort and one hammer's second string films--mainly porviding entertainment value--if u want something that goes alittle deeper in subtect and something that will knock your socks off try--Fisher's Classic The Horror of Dracula(1958), and Peter Sasdy's Marvolous Taste the Blood of Dracula(1970)... or even Fisher's beautifully mounted sequel Dracula: Prince of Darkness(1965)..i'm sure you would be more than pleased.

496127,4,6302676835,"This sequel to PRINCE OF DARKNESS quite possibly one of the more interesting films in the series. When a priest accidently cracks Dracula's icy tomb and bleeds on the vampire's lips, the Lord of the Undead has returned! Finding his castle sealed by a crucifix, Dracula takes revenge on the monsignor who did it by turning his glamorous daughter into the undead, and killing the monsignor himself. All goes well for Dracula until the girl's boyfriend Paul and Dracula's former slave chase Dracula to his castle where the fiend is once again sent to his doom. The only problem I can see is the continuity. It would have been better if the same castle set were reused. The makers should've seen the ending to PRINCE OF DARKNESS prior to making this one. Terrence Fisher is gone and his absense is very evident. However, this movie is extremely good and remains as one of the best films Hammer made. The monsignor should've had a bit more ""oomph"" in him if you know what I mean. Lee is phenomonal as always. However, I believe he is more effective and chilling as Dracula without lines. His expressions of savage evil and bloddy fangs in HORROR OF DRACULA scared me beyond belief! Go ahead and get this one.

496129,3,6302676835,"The third Chrstopher Lee Dracula film starts with the discovery of a dead women with bite marks on her neck, the town immediately believes Dracula is alive again.  A visiting monsignor gets the local priest to accompany him  to castle Dracula, the monsignor seals off the castle with a huge crucifix.  The local priest flees, unwittingly brings Dracula back to life and then  becomes his slave because the priest obviously has no backbone.  Dracula  discovers his castle has been blocked off, so he and the cowardly priest go  to the monsignor's village to seek revenge on him by pursuing his niece.  This film starts out good and finishes very strong with one of the better  endings in the whole series.  There are a number of visuals in this film  that are just wonderful.  The supporting cast is overall good, ecspecially  Rupert Davies as the monsignor.  The main problem with this film is that  there is not much going on in the middle of the film.  Dracula is seen very  little, the other characters just kind of stand around looking like they  are just waiting for something to do. No excitement is being built and no  mood is being set, it just looks like everyone is waiting for Dracula to  show so they can go off to the conclusion.  Christopher Lee does very well  in his parts, but he could have been given more time.

496130,5,6302676835,"Dracula Has Risen From The Grave is awesome. I have always been and still remain one of Christopher Lees Biggest Fans.  What I can recall about Dracula Has Risen From The Grave, is the scene when Christopher Lees under  the ice and a steak is  driven through his heart-at that moment his eyes  open in suspense,then he delivers another one of his best performance, as  he dramatically holds the steak in disbelief that his resurrection of  darkness has come upon him once again.  The last time I viewed Dracula Has  Risen From The Grave, I was a teenager and was truly amazed by Christopher  Lees acting.  I recently had a desire to look at horror films and my first  choice was to buy all of Christopher Lees films for myself as a christmas  gift. I only located the following 3 films:  The Satanic Rites of Dracula,  Dracula A.D. 1972 and The Prince Of Darkness.  My favorite is Dracula Has  Risen From The Grave.

Watching the film again, after more than 15 years, I was surprised by how well it  holds up. Although some of the acting is a bit stilted, and the dialogue  tends to be rather uninspired, the direction, cinematography, sets, and the  presence of Christopher Lee as Dracula are all top-notch. Several scenes in  the film are quite horrifying, and there is a pervading sense of dread in  the production. Like a lot of Hammer films, the key word here is  ""atmosphere,"" and ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave""  delivers impressively. Also, don't let the ""G"" rating fool you.  Although there is no sex, nudity, or extremely graphic violence, a great  deal is suggested (which only adds to the suspense and tension), and even  older viewers may find themselves lost in the spell that this film so  admirably casts.",944524800,8,946,4.538461538461538

496311,3,6302676835,"Warner Bros BD release: 5 stars for the film. 3 stars for the blu ray presentation. This is a superb Dracula film - one of the best in the series, masterfully directed by Freddie Francis (as originally chosen director Terence Fisher was incapacitated due to a car accident). Creative use of lighting, colour and filters adds mood to the evil of the drama. The music score is somewhat repetitive yet this becomes quite haunting as the plot develops, which works well. The opening sequence of the buxom wench falling upside down from the church bell was deftly handled creating some genuine alarm.
Picture quality on this blu ray is certainly good but nothing exceptional - it lacks the fine detail of Hammer's 1958 'Dracula' and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell, both lovingly restored. Warner Bros should have authorised a full and detailed restoration on a film of such pedigree. Apart from the original trailer there are no extras on offer which is a further disappointment.
The blu ray disc comes in a cheap flimsy 'Elite' case - not surprising as behind the artwork sleeve the case is about a third full of holes!

496368,5,6302676835,"so, in honor of christopher lee, i watched dracula has risen from the grave. i've always been esepecially drawn to this movie, i think partly because much of it has to do with faith, or lack thereof. additionally, freddie francis directs beautifully, as we'd expect, and just gives us a gorgeous film. christopher lee is all menace and sexuality, and it's easy to see why he managed to put his signature on this iconic character.

like any good hammer movie, the blood flows in bright red technicolor, the sets are lush and colorful, and the bosoms are heaving. but what's really kind of interesting about this movie are the three male leads, who represent different aspects of religious and non-religious belief. the priest is a coward, an alcoholic, and uncertain of god's ability to protect his flock from christopher lee's wolf. the monsignor, however, is absolutely devout and unflinching in his knowledge that god will deliver them from evil. then there's paul, likably played by barry andrews, who is an athiest and avowed scholar. these three must somehow come together to defeat dracula, made all the more difficult as the weak priest quickly falls under the thrall of the vampire, and paul is getting hot and heavy with with the monsignor's niece. she is played by veronica carlson, and is all that is virginal and pure, making her all the riper for despoiling at christopher lee's hands...and teeth. lee is smoldering darkness here, almost guttural, and his impetus in this particular movie is revenge, revenge for having his home violated by the placement of a crucifix on the doors to his castle. the first scene when he puts the bite on the monsignor's niece, in particular, is played with almost total eroticism, and it further drives home the allure of dracula, and by extension, soulless evil: it's hot.

francis shoots a beautiful movie that is a mix of location shots, rooftops, craggy mountain ranges, and nifty sets. dracula's reemergence is especially gripping, as the sad-sack priest cracks his head and bleeds through he ice that holds the count; we can see through the cracked shards of ice lee's blood soaked lips curling into a smile as he awakens from his frigid prison.

dracula has risen from the grave is filled with typical vampire tropes of that era and it also contains interesting meditations of religion, sexuality, and the struggle between good and evil. i think it makes its' point most strongly when the monsignor, on his death bed, calls for paul to protect his niece maria because the monsignor recognizes that, despite his unapologetic atheism, paul will protect her because ""he truly loves her."" good stuff.",1434153600,4,2650,4.937219730941704

The Movie is one of my favorite, when actors had to convince you how wicked and evil they were with their expression and acting.  Christopher Lee Pro-trays Dracula as it is in the book, a heartless creature of the night, who is very selfish and soulless.  He is an actor that pulls out a story no matter how bad it might be.

the blood from his Head floods Dracula's Ice tomb with Blood
and then Dracula becomes alive once again
the Plot/storyline is very ridiculous but the performances are excellent
Once again Christopher lee gives a fantastic performance as Dracula
back in the late 60'S Hammer studios were just Dishing out sequel after sequel for money sake
it did not matter if the script for the sequels were well written screenplays or totally ridiculous plots
Hammer would make the sequels regardless
in the case of Dracula, Dracula has risen from the Grave was one of the sequels
where the storyline was just plain ridiculous but the Performances of the Actors/Actress's were excellent
plus having Freddie francis Direct, helped aswell
a Direct QUOTE from Christopher Lee about this particular Dracula film
He turned the film down cause the script was plain ridiculous and He hated it
he was only Persuaded to do the film cause Hammer executive Michael carreres
told he had to do the film otherwise he would put all the crew out of work
so Chris Lee played Dracula again out of Loyalty really

this Warner bros DVD release is rated G from the Theatrical release
 but is the UNRATED version by today's standards
which is surprising considering some of the Blood/Gore scenes are very Graphic
the scene where Dracula gets staked in his coffin, you see the blood spurting out from the impact of the stake
about 1min or more footage just on that scene is very Graphic
I Don't know what the ratings board were thinking back in 1968 when they released this film to cinemas
i guess they didn't think much of it, otherwise they would have got Freddie francis to edit some more scenes

the Film is what it is and from a big hammer fans point of view i still enjoy watching the film
mainly cause of Christopher lee's performance as Dracula, he steals the film for sure
even thou he Did not want to do the film, his performance is fantastic

the picture quality is pretty Good in 1:85:1 Widescreen better than the VHS release, the Audio sound is MONO
there are no special features, Just the Trailer
this film is still waiting for a blu-ray release if it ever gets one from Warner bros
the only website that is getting a petition going to try get Warner bros to release this film on blu-ray
is Diaboliquemagazine.com
if your a big fan of this film and want it on blu-ray then go to the website
and post a comment and Hopefully one day warner bros will get the message and release this film on blu-ray
with new extras hopefully
i gave the film 4 stars based on the picture quality",1413936000,2,3079,4.580762250453721

Hammer' s horror flicks had vibrant technicolor, Gothic mood and horror, realistic gore, and a sense of moral resolution and religious themes.  Dracula Has Risen From the Grave has all of these elements but it was also made in 1968 and with the Beatles and the summer of love of 1967, the younger generation was questioning many of the ideas of their parents and society as a whole.  This film touches on several of these concerns and while trying to appeal to a younger audience, it also suggests that in the face of soul scorching evil, the classic approach is the only hope.  The younger generation may have doubted the reasons for Vietnam, but sometimes one may have to look beyond the repulsion to war to confront the fundamental threats to the human psych.  Many of the older generation fought against Hitler because the cost of doing nothing was greater than the distaste of war.  This film is directed by Academy Award winning cinematographer Freddie Francis.  Francis used unique camera angles and a variety of colored lenses to add to the stylish atmosphere of the movie.  Christopher Lee is once again genuinely scary as the blood thirsty prince of darkness.",1373673600,,1264,4.819444444444445

496448,4,6302676835,"Released in the USA in the Winter of 1969, Hammer's ""Dracula has Risen from the Grave"" was the fourth entry in the series and the third with Christopher Lee in the title role. Here's a list of the nine films for those interested:

Horror of Dracula (1958)
The Brides of Dracula (1960)
Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)
Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968)
Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969)
Scars of Dracula (1970)
Dracula AD 1972 (1972)
The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973)
The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974)

""Dracula has Risen from the Grave"" suffers from a weak prologue and first act. The prologue takes place a year prior to the main story. The first act involves two priests hiking up to Dracula's castle to exorcise it. One of the priests unwittingly resurrects the count and the vampire wants revenge on the other priest whom he discovers blessed his abode. The final hour involves Dracula going after his niece in a neighboring village. The niece's boyfriend and the priest must defend her.

Like I said, the whole first act isn't very promising, but things perk up with the introduction of the niece's boyfriend, Paul, and the pub his dad runs. Barbara Ewing plays Zena, the redhead waitress at the pub, and the film shows the close relationships between Paul, his father and Zena. The characters ring true and it draws the viewer into their world. Excellent job on this front.

A great scene takes place when Paul's girlfriend, Maria (played by the stunning Veronica Carlson), takes Paul to her home to introduce him to her mother and the priest, who's a Monsignor (whatever that is). Paul is cornered in a conversation and forced to reveal that he doesn't believe in God. The Monsignor is initially offended and rude, but this can be excused on the grounds that he's the father-figure to his beloved niece; besides there's a warmhearted scene later in the film where the Monsignor proves his loving nature.

Another unusual highlight of the film are the multiple scenes that take place on the labyrinthian rooftops of the  Victorian village. I can't help but wonder how they accomplished this. Were they really filming on the rooftops of a village or is it an illusion accomplished through matte paintings or other effects? I'm sure it's the latter; regardless, it's excellent film work and a unique feature of this film.

Of course, Hammer films are renown for their curvaceous women and here we have two: Redhead Barbara Ewing as the very likable Zena, and Veronica Carlson, who can also be seen in the outstanding ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Must-Be-Destroyed/dp/B0001FVE5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed</a>"".

As with most of Hammer's horror flicks, the movie possesses a beautifully lush, gothic atmosphere.

Despite the weak first act, the positives noted above compel me to place ""Dracula has Risen from the Grave"" as my second or third favorite of the series. My favorite being ""Taste the Blood of Dracula.""

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, England.

Instead, one of the priests is placed under Dracula's hypnotic spell, and the two speed off to Kleinenberg, where the Count stages his revenge against the Monsignor by seducing his young niece. Freddie Francis directs the fourth installment in Hammer's Dracula series with a distinct visual flair that makes for many memorable moments in DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE. His most impressive shots are taken from the incredible rooftop sets that overlook the Kleinenberg skyline, where Dracula will eventually beset his victims in one of several climactic confrontations. Christopher Lee is as ruthless and menacing as ever, spouting his lines with signs of pure hatred while showing a smug sense of satisfaction as he closes in on his revenge. The scene in which he attacks the barmaid, Zena, is particularly frightening, but better still is the picturesque image of Lee perched upon the rooftop with his cape flowing gently in the breeze. A beautiful yet terrifying moment, to be sure. Ewan Hooper stands out above the rest of the crowd as the unfortunate priest who falls under Dracula's evil spell, but Barry Andrews and Veronica Carlson are also very good as the young lovers, Paul and Maria. James Bernard succeeds with another wonderful score, as well. DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE is a notable improvement over the second sequel, and a fine film overall.

In closing,my 3 favorite Lee/Dracula movies are Horror of Dracula,Dracula Prince of Darkness,and Scars of Dracula.

496541,4,6302676835,"I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...

All Hammer horror movies are a little campy, and Dracula Has Risen From The Grave (1969) is no exception.  Hammer mixes camp and horror well.  That's what makes Hammer movies fun to watch.  OK, this movie has nothing to do with Bram Stoker's 1897 novel.  It's a sequel invented by Hammer Studios that Bram Stoker obviously never had a hand in writing.  Putting this aside, when I take this movie at face value, it's a good vampire movie that features the character of Dracula.  Dracula Has Risen From The Grave is a much darker and more gothic movie than the first Hammer Dracula movie Horror Of Dracula (1958).  The 1958 movie is brightly lit throughout much of the movie, which dilutes its scariness to a certain degree, in my opinion.  Dracula Has Risen From The Grave uses colored filters in a lot of the scenes with Dracula and his castle in them.  The colors used are reds and yellows.  It's kind of weird, but really doesn't detract from the movie overall.

This movie, believe it or not, was rated G.  It's the bloodiest G rated movie I've ever seen!  Nowadays this movie would get a PG-13 rating.  This movie stars Christopher Lee, Rupert Davies, Veronica Carlson, Barry Andrews, Barbara Ewing, Ewan Hooper, George A. Cooper, Michael Ripper, and John D. Collins.

Christopher Lee was good as Dracula.  He really doesn't get much screen time.  He says a few lines here and there.  The rest of the cast did a pretty good job.

Overall, this is a good vampire flick that features Dracula.  I recommend it.",1301529600,3,1561,4.6036363636363635

496543,4,6302676835,"This was amazing.  A G-rated Dracula film!

I actually saw this Hammer film out of order, seeing the later one first (Taste the Blood of Dracula&nbsp;] , also with Christopher Lee).

A monsignor is riding down the path to the village to see how it's going after he got rid of Dracula the last time.  (See, I need to watch the earlier films!).  However, little does he know of the horror that is already taking place!

A happy boy on a bike rides into church, takes two or three swishes of his broom (There, it's clean!  I do this too, but usually it goes under a rug.  But I digress.).  He is about to pull the bell rope when he notices blood dripping off it.  When he goes to investigate he screams bloody murder (literally) and runs off.

The priest also discovers what's in the bell -- a buxom female body with a very large hicky, courtesy of Count Dracula!  Eeek!

the story continues on, with the monsignor berating his drunken priest, scolds the town for not showing up for church (the shadow of Dracula's castle falls on it -- great excuse to go to the tavern and play balance the beer glass on the broomstick -- no, I'm not making this up!).

After Dracula wakes up (thanks to the clumsy priest who falls down, cuts his head, and has the blood from said wound conveniently drip into an unconscious Dracula's mouth -- who said vamp is lying under a very thin sheet of ice) he enthralls the priest and tries to return to his castle.

However, when the monsignor blessed the castle with an exorcism rite and placed the big cross from the village church on the doorway, Dracula wanted to know: ""Who has done this thing?""  The priest opens his big mouth: ""The monsignor!""  Dummy!

The attempt at shock and horror is light fare, although the woman with the hicky hanging upside-down in a bell would probably increase the rating to a PG in my opinion.

It's interesting how Dracula puts key people under his power and then has them do his bidding (the drunk priest and the barmaid Xena).  In this case, Drac wants that monsignor.  He could use the fact that the monsignor's niece, Maria, is marrying an atheist, Paul, for his own dark ends.

The subplot of Paul and Maria is interesting, but this is no romantic comedy!

Blondes balancing on rooftops and hugging atheists and a Barbie dolls make for interesting cinema.  Dracula meeting his end through the actions of an atheist -- the irony is classic.

Mood music and the colorful scenes and red lighting, the blood-shot eyes and the hunger deep in his soul -- dang, Hammer Films, what happened??

Recommended!

496547,4,6302676835,"Not having seen this for a long time, to watch it again now in widescreen on a big TV was a real treat. Its certainly as good as Dracula Prince of Darkness, though not as good as the original, which for me is the best Hammer film as made.

The main reasons for its success are Freddie Francis direction, James Bernard for another classic score, and the films use of Christopher Lee. Unlike in the later sequels, in this film Lee has plenty to do and makes many appearances throughout the film. Interesting watching it for the first time on DVD it does look to me as though Christopher Lee was wearing a wig. Not that surprising since he was 46 years old when this was made.

The film has a genuinely gothic feel to it, and although not in the least bit scary by todays standards, there are nevertheless one or two creepy moments. Of the rest of the cast Rupert Davies as the Monsignor is perhaps the best, in fact I would of like to have seen more of his character in the film.

The only extra on the DVD is the original trailer. There are no commentaries or outtakes which is a pity.

Its a shame that Peter Cushing didn't appear in the first two sequels. His presence would have improved the film. Nevertheless this is probably equal 2nd best with Dracula Prince of Darkness and gets 3.5 stars from me.",1240272000,,1304,4.331967213114754
496578,4,6302676835,"Though there are mixed reactions to ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"", I personally found it to be very interesting and thought-provoking. The story here begins with the little village in which Castle Dracula is located. It's been a year since the count's reign of terror ended, and yet mysterious events still plague the villagers. When the Monsignor [Rupert Davies] returns for a routine visit, he finds the villagers cowering in fear, including the Parish Priest himself [Ewan Hooper]. When the Monsignor undertakes to exorcise the Castle once and for all, events transpire differently - an unfortunate cut on the Priest's head proves to be the nourishment that brings the Count back to life, though the Monsignor remains oblivious of this fact, returning to his own village. The Count and his now faithful servant, the priest follow hot on the Monsignor's heels, bent on revenge - the target being the Monsignor's lovely niece, Maria [Veronica Carlson]. It's left to the Monsignor and Maria's atheist boyfriend, Paul [Barry Andrews] to save Maria before it's too late.

The production values in this movie were actually quite good - the sets, the score, and cinematography all enhanced the storytelling and made this movie very dark and menacing [the cellar under the inn where the Count is forced to reside looks very authentic].

The acting was good - Christopher Lee returns as the Count and this time, he is really mad and bent on revenge, with more screen time and dialogue to convey his anger. His lust for his prey is convincingly portrayed as usual and the female victims once again fall hopelessly under his spell, baring their necks in anticipation of the Count's 'embrace'. Rupert Davies is also strong in his portrayal of the Monsignor and special mention needs to be made of Ewan Hooper's fallen priest. His guilt and conflict comes across as genuine, and this was one aspect of the movie that made it really good for me - the corruption of good by Dracula, and the test of faith in both the Priest and also the atheist Paul.

All in all, I found this instalment to be well-made and entertaining and  would recommend it to all Dracula fans as well as those who like classic vampire movies.",1226275200,,2207,4.846153846153846

496581,4,6302676835,"I knew to expect good things from the opening frames, which show a tide of blood washing down the screen. The blood flows around the letters of the name DRACULA like river water flowing around big rocks and continues to drip down the screen. A good sign, giving the impression that the movie will be drenched in blood.
  We open on a young simple looking fellow cruising along on a goofy early 1900's looking bicycle, the type Mr. Burns from the Simpsons might have ridden in his youth. The fellow cruises through a small Eastern European looking burg, the kind of place that looks to have a strudel-based economy. He's the church groundskeeper and at some point decides to ring the church bell. When he grabs the bell rope he jerks his hands back and we see that they are now COVERED with blood!

A priest comes in and decides to investigate all the blood and climbs to the top of the bell tower, where a buxom village girl is hanging upside down inside the bell. A close-up of her throat reveals a pretty ghastly wound, punctuated by two, tooth sized puncture marks. Wuh-oh! Time to immigrate to America! ( Sometimes pursuing the American Dream meant pursuing the dream of not having all your blood sucked out by an Eastern European aristocrat.)
  Luckily, a doughty monsignor manages to show up and only a year later. He dresses down the priest, who now drinks heavily, The towns people are still freaked out and the priest hasn't done anything to alay their fears. So the monsignor persuades the priest to join him on a little nature hike up to Castle Dracula, where they'll install a big golden crucifix in the Count's doorway and perform a Rite of Exorcism. That should take the wind out of the old Count's cape!
  The priest however is a wuss, and halfway up the mountain he starts crying about how he can't go any further. The monsignor, who is schlepping the big, heavy golden cross, tells him to stay where he is and rest. Monsignor will take care of the dirty work.
  Long story short, the monsignor reads the Rites while a scary storm whips up; throwing lightning bolts all helter skelter. The priest, Father Nancy-Boy, stumbles in a fit of drunken panic and falls on some rocks and cuts himself. The blood trickles out of the priest and down through a hole right into Count Dracula's mouth, Drac having been frozen in the ice in the last movie. Drac is revived. The priest, as the broken often do, becomes a Servant of Evil.
  The Count is madder than a wet hen because he's been evicted from his Castle thanks to the Crucifix and Exorcism Rites and decides to get revenge on the Monsignor. And that's the plot right there.
  Turns out the Monsignor's niece, Maria, is the hottest fraulein in the Shire or Fatherland or wherever they live and she's seeing a local wise acre named Paul, who works in a bakery until he can find something more meaningful that will engage his (imaginary) great intellect. When Paul's boss asks him why he studies so much, Paul answers that he wants to learn about Truth and become a success. ""Well,"" the old baker replies,"" If you want to be a success you better steer clear of the Truth"". Paul shows us how brash and headstrong he is by laughing off this sound advice and heading off to the tavern, where he meets Maria.
  At the tavern, a gaggle of college boys are singing ,playing drinking games,enjoying the spirit of Bon Homme a little too much, not that there's anything wrong with that, and suppressing their Homme tendencies by group commenting on the waitress, who has bigger endowments than Harvard Law School( Ba-DUM-Dum). Zena is the Quintessential Saucy Tavern Wench. When the lads nod at her cleavage and tell her that her ""dumplings are boiling over"", she's the kind of girl who laughs it off and then cracks them over the head with her serving tray. . She's contrasts Maria who comes across as the type who would make you wear a tie to Sunday dinner and make you take all your Gwar posters down because they are ""Icky"". Give Uncle Hammockrider the Saucy Tavern Girl every time!  Once you see Maria's innocent beauty, you know how the Count is going to direct his thirst for vengeance. There's a great scene where Dracula puts the Hypno-Whammy on Maria, seducing her with the power of his evil mind.

The rest of the movie is Paul and the Monsignor trying to rescue Maria and take the Count down for...the count. (sorry)

Christopher Lee is so good as Dracula his performance is usually taken for granted. Veronica Carlson reminding me of a young Linda Evans during her big Valley days, is one of the sexiest would-be-vampire brides. Barry Andrews is brash and brave as Maria's devoted lover and Rupert Davies does a great job as the Monsignor, wise backbone of the anti-Drac Squad. My favorite character though, was Zena, who was funny, sweet and tragic and well played by Barbara Ewing. She deserved better than what she got.
  The ending features one the best Dracula death scenes ever filmed. And when you see whom it is who REALLY gets his revenge, you'll agree that he deserves it. It was a strong note to end the movie on.

The plot is a bit thin but there are lots of memorable Hammer moments here, and it's just plain fun. There will always be an audience for old-fashioned entertaining monster movies like this one. FANGtastic!",1222041600,,5296,4.600849256900212
496582,4,6302676835,"For the US release of Hammer's fourth Dracula film (only the third to actually feature Christopher Lee, the Count sitting out Brides of Dracula), Warner Bros. used a one-sheet of a woman's neck with a sticking plaster on it, following the title Dracula Has Risen From the Grave with the single word 'Obviously.' The film itself, however, is anything but tongue-in-cheek, and played deadly straight with a conviction the series gradually lost over the years. It's probably the best-looking of all the Hammer Dracula sequels, and also the first where Christopher Lee actually speaks. As usual he's almost a background figure for much of the film, with the bulk of the film carried by Barry Andrews' atheist student romancing Veronica Carlson's niece of Rupert Davies' Monsignor, who inadvertently starts the blood flowing again when his attempt to exorcise Dracula's castle only results in the Count being revived from his icy grave by blood from a convenient cut. Finding himself cast out of his home and aided by Ewan Hooper's terrified priest (Renfield presumably being otherwise engaged), Dracula determines to take his revenge on Davies and his kin, stopping off en route for a light snack with Barbara Ewing's busty redheaded barmaid.

With a prologue that takes place before Dracula, Prince of Darkness and the main body of the film taking place a year later, it takes some liberties with the vampire mythology: the revived Dracula's first appearance is as a reflection, he has no problem removing crosses from willing girls' necks while a stake alone is no longer enough to kill him: you have to pray as well, which is a bit of a problem when your hero doesn't believe in God. Yet they're not as jarring as they might be, the latter resulting in one particularly memorably gory sequence. The change in director from Terence Fisher, sadly in decline at that time and unavailable due to a car crash, to Freddie Francis gives the film less of a production-line feel than most of the studio's Dracula series and, despite an awkward filter in some scenes and a distinctly jaundiced look for the Count, the film has a much more expansive look and feel almost unique in the series, with a striking and well-employed rooftop set courtesy of undervalued production designer Bernard Robinson and some relatively unfamiliar Pinewood standing sets rather than the overused backlot at Bray. He gets good performances too, with a particularly nice turn from Michael Ripper as an amiable innkeeper (as opposed to his usual miserable and terrified innkeepers).

Unfortunately while the DVD boasts excellent colour and definition, some shots look oddly distorted, as if stretched, and the sound wanders in and out of synch far too often for comfort. On the plus side it does restore the censor cuts of about half a dozen gallons of blood spurting from Dracula's chest after he gets staked and includes the original trailer.",1204675200,,2912,5.002061855670103

I still get a kick out of it when I watch it again...I am used to watching Christopher Lee acting as Count Dracula and have a good collection of films with him as the main actor. In the late 1950s to early 1960's the Hammer Film Production (Pine Studios) of England did a splendid job both in cinematograph and conveying the Gothic mood in their films of Dracula. Its choice of Christopher Lee was splendid because he just fitted in the role appropriately. Other scenes included the frightened  villagers  gathered in a tavern to drink beer and discussed in whispers about the terrifying powers of the Count; the sound of horses galloping down the deserted village road on a driverless carriage; the  final dissolution  of the Count's body into dust only to be resurrected again with a few drops of human blood by his bat companion;  the Count himself engaging the lonely traveller in a prolong dialogue in the candle-lit hall of the castle; and he telling the traveller that he had earlier ""eaten"", then the distant crowing of a village rooster which was hint for the Count to rise up and go back to his stone coffin before struck by the sunlight were naturalistic atmosphere that only Hammer Film Productions had successfully interpretted in all its classic films on Dracula.

496606,5,6302676835,"This film, the fourth of the Hammer Dracula Series (third with Christopher Lee), is in my opinion, the best.  As a few other reviewers have noted, HORROR OF DRACULA seems to have maintained it's status as ""Best vampire film"" based on years of people believing it because some film critic once said so.  Is it a bad film? No, it's quite good, but this one is better.

 Why? Because the film has such a dark, gothic look and sound to it. Because the story is interesting in that it is the holy men of the church who set Dracula loose (one of them even becoming his henchman), while the unbelieving atheist sets out to save the day (or least  save his girlfriend). Further, this film clearly demonstrated the fact that for all their faith, knowledge and effort the protagonists can't always do it alone. They need for the antagonist (Dracula) to make a fatal error or series of errors to bring about his own destruction. This time around, Dracula does just that, setting-up his own demise on the cross.

496608,4,6302676835,"Among the countless horror figures the film industry exploited throughout the years, there is no doubt that Dracula is the most popular and immortal icon of them all. From Max Schreck to Bela Lugosi to Christopher Lee to Gary Oldman, and more recently resurrected yet again in Wes Craven's Dracula 2000 and in Van Helsing; Dracula has steadily grown to be the most popular vampire and horror character of all time. Yet, no matter how many more Dracula versions will continue to exist in the future (seeing Hollywood's continuous fascination in milking every last drop from a franchise); I will always remain to cherish two particular versions of Dracula in my heart. And these are Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee. I don't think I need to expand on the greatness of Lugosi, as every respectable horror movie fanatic should know who he is and what he contributed to the vampire genre for several years to come. In the case of Christopher Lee, he managed to become a horror legend back in the 50's, 60's and 70's thanks to his Dracula Hammer films. And I dare say that every inch of success he obtained was well deserved; given the fact that he created one of the most charismatic vampires in cinema history. In my book, no Saruman or Count Dooku would ever come close to the coolness that was Count Dracula.

Dracula has risen from the grave is actually the fourth film in the whole Hammer series (which can boast of a total of eight entries), and one of the seven films out of all these to feature Christopher Lee. Ironically enough, the producers had no choice but to make the second instalment, Brides Of Dracula, without Lee; the reason being that Lee himself was afraid of type-casting at the time. He seemed to eventually change his mind over time since he then came back for no less than six sequels. Many fans of these movies seem to agree that Dracula has risen from the grave is the last real good entry into the series. It is actually a very good film in its own right, made back in the days when atmosphere was preferred to false scares and suspense was preferred to giving petty theories on why Dracula acts the way he does. This is as a matter of fact one of the main gripes I have with several modern versions. Remember the ending to Dracula 2000 and all that Judas Escariot nonsense? Many horror movies nowadays try too hard to construct an interesting story, and seem to forget that their primary reason of existence should be to frighten the unsuspecting viewer as effectively as possible. The Hammer Film producers were definitely aware of this, and Dracula has risen from the grave is living proof. The film doesn't give us any information on Dracula's background and evil origins, partly because it's a sequel and partly because this was the way many horror movies were approached back in the days. As soon as Dracula is out of his grave he immediately jumps into action, without any clear motives except for the fact he wanted to seek some sort of revenge on the Monsignor that tried to exorcise his castle. This is actually quite secondary to the whole premise though. All we need to know is that he's Count Dracula and he's an evil force. If we acknowledge just that, we are almost guaranteed to enjoy the movie. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, and I think it even helps to make the entire Dracula mystique all the more frightening. One of the golden rules I've learned from my experience in watching horror movies is that the less you know about the villain, the more scary the movie will turn out to be. Just compare Halloween to its sequels as one example.

Surprisingly, this movie also featured a recurring sexual element in it; and it's one of the first movies responsible to introduce the concept of the seductive vampire. There is absolutely no form of nudity in it; yet the film still fells strangely erotic in some places, particularly evidenced by the clothes worn by the female bartender and the sensual face expression of a female character lead when she's bitten by Dracula. The film manages to be sexy without feeling the need to include sex, also partly thanks to the natural beauty of Veronica Carlson, whom director Freddie Francis successfully exploits every angle of her charm to full effect.

The film's flaws are quite minor, and they usually have to do with some plot-holes or continuity errors. For example, it is never explained why Dracula didn't order the priest to take off the crucifix attached on his castle the first time he sees it. Instead, he decides to leave it there for no apparent reason; and when he goes back to the castle at the end of the film, he quickly orders Maria to take it off herself. This factor should be quite noteworthy since it will eventually influence Dracula's fate. Another thing I noticed happens during the chase scene between Dracula and Zena. This scene should've taken place at night; yet the shots seem to jump from dark night to early dawn continously. And I never fully understood where the first victim hidden in the church bell came from, since Dracula was still sleeping for over a year when the bell ringer finds the body.

Such trivial inconsistencies shouldn't nonetheless stop you from enjoying such a well-made vampire movie. When you hear James Bernard's haunting score in the opening credits, when you see Christopher Lee light the screen with his presence, when you experience a movie filled with such eerie atmosphere; you know you have just found a long- forgotten little gem.",1130544000,5,5491,4.698857736240914
496609,3,6302676835,"""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave"", was probably the best of Hammer Studio's Dracula sequels.  The film was hurt considerably by the lack of Peter Cushing, who was in the pseudo-sequel, ""The Brides of Dracula.""  However, in its favor was that Lee's Dracula was no longer expected to turn in an actual acting performance, but to serve only as a presence, an almost animal presence at that.  This is where he was only expected to hiss and bare his fangs constantly, in a Sir Francis Varney sort of way.  By now the orgiastic reactions of the victims were wearing thinner than their negligees.

My main reason for enjoying ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave,"" was that it was so lush.  The night scenery was awash in deep blues and reds.  The houses were full of realistic Victorian clutter.  The movie covered some of the religious sensibilites of Bram Stoker's original novel, where they read the Prayer for the Dead over those they staked.  So having an atheist hero who couldn't pray was an interesting sub-theme, as well as his eventual conversion, because of his having to fight an evil he never knew existed.  Even the scene where Dracula wrenched a stake out of his own heart was significant, because it echoes a myth I read where a vampire actually thanked the villagers who staked him for, ""...providing me with a post to fight off the dogs with... .""  Uninformed critcs cried foul over this scene at the time, because the only legends they were familiar with were the versions provided by Universal Studios.

The only major drawback in the film was in the actresses.  Starting with ""Brides of Dracula,"" the actress were looking more and more like young women of the 1960's and less and less like the 1890's.  Negligees, hairstyles, and even eye make-up were clearly for the hoochy factor, not realism.",1122336000,3,1808,4.73482428115016
496610,4,6302676835,"While Christopher Lee isn't the ultimate Dracula (that honor will always be Bela Lugosi's), DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE is fine, engaging, budget horror from Hammer Studios.

In this installment of the seemingly eternal vampire saga, the indefatigable Count has taken up residence under the local tavern in a small German town (excuse the British accents), and is busily slaking his thirst courtesy of the local tavern wench and the young, dashing hero's pretty blonde girlfriend.

Dracula has turned the local Monsignor into Renfield, and is thoroughly enjoying himself when the townsmen realize that something is amiss. The inevitable battle between good and evil follows.

Lee's Dracula is intense and compelling. His hypnotic gaze would be frightening except for the fact that his eyes become fiery red just before he feeds. Rather than being mesmerizing though, Lee merely looks eyestrained. The word ""Visine"" kept coming to mind. The good thing is that except for this bit of unintended camp, the film never sags.

As is typical of Hammer Films the sexual element of the Dracula legend is played up. Hammer's treatments were always stylish, wonderfully atmospheric, and vividly memorable.

496673,5,6302676835,"I have yet to see another actor portray the famous Transylvanian Count as well as Christopher Lee!  He seems to have been born to play the part of Dracula (or a variety thereof).  It's hard not to shudder with fright when Mr. Lee's cape-draped image is shown on screen. His presence is quite imposing indeed! And his evil presence looks even better when viewed on DVD.

Lee sharpens his fangs once more for ""Dracula Has Risen From The Grave"", a late 1960s Hammer Film and the third in its ongoing Dracula cycle (following ""Horror Of Dracula"" and ""Dracula -- Prince Of Darkness"").

In my view, it's a bit difficult to pick a clear-cut winner between these first three Hammer vampire entries. Each has its own set of good qualities, with all of them worthy of collecting on DVD.  In other words, each movie has quite a lot of ""bite"" to it. (Er...sorry, I couldn't resist.) *wink*

""Risen From The Grave"" has a bit of a more modern flavor to it; but the old-fashioned Gothic touches are still in place here too, with plenty of dark, eerie camera angles, foggy and misty rooftops, and dank cellars occupying space in this motion picture. The movie is also greatly enhanced by a marvelous musical score (by James Bernard). It fits a Dracula movie to a tee!

The scenes that take place in the basement/cellar of the bakery are even tinged with the proverbial sounds of dripping water that are many times associated with this type of horror flick. I love those ""dripping"" sounds coming from Dracula's temporary cellar hideout. (How Dracula or his assistant were able to get the large coffin down the basement stairs without a soul noticing is yet another matter. But, I suppose that's the kind of trivial thing that we're not supposed to dwell on in too much detail. In fact, the very same thing occurs in ""Horror Of Dracula"" as well -- with Dracula planting his daytime home in the basement of the house of one of his victims, without anyone even noticing. Oh, well...)  :)

The first three Hammer ""Dracula"" films sport very good continuity, with Dracula's inevitable resurrection being explained in the succeeding films in ways that don't strain credibility to the breaking point (well, at least as far as ""Dracula credibility"" is concerned at any rate).

The DVD is 1-sided, with excellent front cover art (plus other good pics of Chris Lee on the snap-case packaging and on the Menus). The only extra feature on the disc is the film's Trailer (run time of 2:26), which is shown in anamorphically-enhanced form and is in very good shape (picture quality-wise).

When you load up this Warner Brothers' DVD you're greeted by an anamorphic Main Menu, featuring an image of a ready-to-bite Dracula/C. Lee, and a portion of the film's outstanding music score (which plays once before the main feature begins automatically, per most Warner DVDs).

496675,3,6302676835,"Dracula Has Risen from the Grave is an entertaining addition to Hammer's Dracula series. Terence Fisher, who directed the first three in the series, had to pull out at the last minute due to an accident, and it was left to lighting cameraman Freddie Francis to take the reins. The film reveals a shift in the underlying worldview: Fisher's triumphant vision of good conquering evil, God defeating Satan is supplanted by Francis's bleaker universe, where God is apparently no guarantee against the Devil, and whose central religious figure (Monsignor, played by Rupert Davies, no match for Andrew Keir or Peter Cushing) is blustering, naive and impotent in the face of evil.
There are some great scenes, as one would expect from a distinguished cinematographer like Francis, although some of the most visually compelling moments (eg. Maria's bedroom scene with the Count, by far the most explicitly sexualized portrayal of vampirism seen up to that time) sit uneasily alongside the bizarrely artless, shakey, badly focused handheld shots.
Still, it's vintage Hammer hokum, and certainly miles ahead of later additions to the Dracula series. I bought this for nostalgic reasons -- hadn't seen it since I was a kid -- and I wasn't disappointed.

496678,4,6302676835,"Seems like people either love or hate this particular entry into the Hammer Dracula line of films.  I, myself, enjoyed it very much, and would recommend it to anyone interested in the vampire genre.
Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1969) has Christopher Lee reprising his role as the ultimate blood-sucking creature of the night, which is kind of strange as in the last film, Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966), he was destroyed...or so we thought.  The film takes place a year after the last film, as Monsignor Ernest Muller (Rupert Davies) visits the small village near Dracula's no empty castle to see how things are getting along.  Well, things aren't getting along too well as the Monsignor finds the church empty and in a rather poor state of housekeeping.  Finding the priest at the local bar, he learns that the villagers believe that while Dracula may be dead, his castle projects an aura of evil, casting a malignant shadow of evil on the town.  The Monsignor decides the only course of action is to trek up to the castle, say a prayer of exorcism, and place a fairly large cross at the doorway, expelling the curse forever.  Taking the priest with him, the two begin a long and arduous journey up the mountain, but, as they near the castle, the priest balks from fear, and the Monsignor continues on alone.  He reaches the castle, says the prayer, and places the cross (the result of both actions cause a rather freakish lighting storm...good thing he rid himself of that big, metal cross).  Meanwhile, the priest, who remained behind, starts freaking out, and begins to stumble down the mountain, trips, cracks his head open, and lands on and cracks a pool of ice, one which contains the body of Dracula, and begins to bleed onto the ice, to which the blood revives the dark, yet frozen, one.  Upon waking, Dracula takes the weak-willed priest into his service, and returns to his castle only to find his entry spoiled by the cross affixed to the doors.  This angers him, as his house has been defiled, and being a creature of evil, seeks revenge on whoever did this.  Good thing he's got the priest to fill him in on the details...
The Monsignor leaves the village to return to his home, which he shares with his sister and her daughter, Maria (Veronica Carlson), soon followed by Dracula and his new little buddy.  We also get to meet Maria's boyfriend, Paul (Barry Andrews), who works in a local bakery/bar/hotel (interesting combination, to be sure), but is only doing so until he can complete his education, and move on to bigger and better things.  Anyhow, Dracula moves into the sub-basement (the sewers) below the bakery/bar/hotel, setting up his coffin and such, and begins with his plans to exact vengeance on the Monsignor and his house.  He learns of the Monsignor's niece, and sees a perfect opportunity to carry out his goal...does he exact his revenge?  Can anyone stop this monster once and for all?
Directed by Freddie Francis, who won academy awards for cinematography for his work on Sons and Lovers (1960) and Glory (1989), Dracula Has Risen from the Grave is certainly stylish, oozing with atmosphere and providing a good deal of suspense.  Christopher Lee provides an excellent performance, despite his overall lack of dialogue.  The settings are very suitable for this kind of film, enhancing the performances, and certainly add to the overall presence of oppressive evil throughout.  Not really embraced by the critics when it first came out, with claims that the gore was a bit much, now it seems rather understated to the 21st century viewer.  The film does proceed slowly, but the pacing seems methodical, all building up to the thrilling climax.
Warner Brothers provides a crisp, clean looking wide screen print here, but very little along the lines of special features, including only a theatrical trailer for the film.  I am appreciative that this film finally made it to DVD, as Warner Brothers, in general, is pretty stingy about releasing their catalog of films to this format, and even stingier when it comes to enhancing their releases with special features, falling back mainly on recycling ones released for the laserdisc format.  If you are interesting in seeing the other films in this series, look for Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966), Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969), Scars of Dracula (1970), Dracula AD 1972 (1972), and The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973).

496679,5,6302676835,"Everyone has their favorite Hammer Dracula film. Opinions vary from different perspectives. I like this installment for several reasons. Christopher Lee has always been my favorite Dracula and ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave"" serves him well. He is at his most sinister here and even though Peter Cushing is missing, Lee has the Catholic church to contend with and this seems fitting due to the overall Gothic aura that surrounds the vampire myth. He has overtaken a weak priest and seeks revenge due to a large crucifix that has been placed over the door to his castle during an exorcism by the Monsigneur (Rupert Davies) because the shadow of the castle is falling across the church--- effectively spooking the priest and keeping the parishoners away. Dracula is out to avenge his throne by seeking out the Monsigneur's lovely niece Maria (Veronica Carlson). But he first enslaves the local barmaid Zena (Barbara Ewing). I liked the juxtaposition between ""good girl"" (Carlson) and ""bad girl"" (Ewing) as well as the crisis that arises when Maria's boyfriend announces his athiesm but must confront his beliefs when spirituality is called upon to defeat Dracula and rescue Maria. But the best thing of all for this reviewer is the DVD print from Warner Bros. which I found virtually flawless. This is a particularly colorful Hammer/Dracula film with some great location shooting and good Gothic atmosphere---especially the shots of the village rooftops where Maria meets her lover and Dracula comes to seek her out. The casting is good and the acting first rate right down to the small roles. Included is a wonderful theatrical trailer that I remember very well from this film's release in 1969---so well done as to guarantee to bring in the business. So I am recommending this disc to the fans. For the price, you can't go wrong. Enjoy.",1083110400,,1839,4.974025974025974
496680,4,6302676835,"It's about time Warner got around to releasing more of their Hammer films on DVD!  As someone who has been waiting patiently for years to see a great print of this film, I find it hard (though not impossible) to find any faults with this release.  Like WB's previous releases of Horror of Dracula, Curse of Frankenstein and The Mummy, pretty much the only extra here is a theatrical trailer.
As for the film, I've always felt it was a bit underrated.  DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS, the previous entry in the series, has been revered for reasons I've never fully understood.  It's incredibly slow-moving, is almost entirely set in one location, and Christopher Lee doesn't even speak!  At all!  At least DRACULA HAS RISEN has a bit more going on, so to speak.  OK, there's too much religious ""symbolism"", which doesn't hold (holy) water upon even minor scrutiny.  Sure, Drac just took a HUGE wooden stake to the heart...but ya gotta PRAY over it for it to work?  Huh?  The early scene in the church is creepy however; so much so, that not much else that follows it seems scary.
On the plus side, there's the fetching Veronica Carlson, some fabulous sets (love those rooftop scenes!), and the ever-imposing Mr. Lee doing his blood-red-eye thing.  Director Freddie Francis has been elsewhere maligned as being no Terence Fisher (Hammer's most prolific and arguably gifted craftsman).  But Francis holds his own here, despite his over-reliance on filters and the occasional out-of-focus zoom.
So, what we have here is this: A first-rate transfer of a solid entry in Hammer's Dracula series.  Oh, and for the uninitiated, here's the complete series in order:
HORROR OF DRACULA, BRIDES OF DRACULA, DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS, DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE, TASTE THE BLOOD OF DRACULA, SCARS OF DRACULA, DRACULA A.D. 1972, THE SATANTIC RITES OF DRACULA, THE LEGEND OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN VAMPIRES.
And yes, I know BRIDES and LEGEND don't feature Christopher Lee.  They still have Peter Cushing as Van Helsing and are part of the series.",1083024000,7,2027,4.871720116618076
496681,5,6302676835,"This is without doubt the absolute best of the Hammer Dracula films! This film is interesting, exciting and FUN! Sure, Dracula is a one-dimensional character, but that's part of the fun. Check out the orignal book - Dracula is a demonic embodiment of evil, and that's the Count's role in this film. Dracula is sort of a background presence of evil who uses hapless humans to do his bidding!
This outing starts out splendidly with a scary scene in a church. When I was a kid this film was a staple on the CBS Friday night late show. It took my sister and I about three tries before we could make it past the body falling out of the church bell. Of course that was a more innocent time, today it takes a bit more to scare jaded kids.
But this film is a nostalgic delight! Today it can be enjoyed as the campy fun it is. The story is interesting and has a wonderful sense of irony. It never takes itself too seriously, but just sets out to be a good-old fashioned, mildly spooky yarn.
After the scary church prologue scene, the story proper gets started  with the arrival of the Monsignor to a little village (the home of the afore mentioned church) which falls in the very shadow of Dracula's castle. It is Sunday morning, but the church is empty. The monsignor finds the priest in the tavern. No one will attend mass because of the terrible attrocity committed in the church by Dracula in his last rampage.
The monsignor reminds the frightened villagers and priest that Dracula is dead, drowned in the river in the mountains (See Dracula, Prince of Darkness.) They contend that the Count's evil presence still haunts the district.
The next morning the Monsignor drags the reluctant priest along and off they climb to Castle Dracula to perform an exorcism. Now the fun really begins - what they actually accomplish is inadvertantly reviving Dracula and freeing him from his icy tomb in the frozen river; locking him out of his castle by a huge cross chained to the front door ( their intention was to trap his spirit inside, instead they lock him out); and royally piss of the ill-tempered Count, sending him on another rampage!
The characters are all pretty well developed. Ewan Hooper is excellent as the tortured priest, enslaved by Dracula and forced to do horrible things. Barry Andrews and Veronica Carlson are interesting and likable as the young lovers that are the principle story line. Barbara Ewing as Zena is one of the most well developed and sympathetic of all Hammer heroines. Rupert Davies is a stand out as the well meaning Monsignor. And, of course, Christopher Lee is the coolest Dracula of all. Mean as hell and taking no prisoners.
Like ""Romeo and Juliet"", released the same year, 1968, the film, though a period piece, is given a comtemporary feel. Here it is accomplished by the young hero's atheism and Barbara Ewing's ""lovable whore"" Zena character. Young people of the late sixties must have identified with these characters and situations which mirrored the changing times and youthful rebellion against previous mores. Maybe that accounts, along with a campy advertising campaign from WB, for the film being the highest grossing of all Hammer films. That, plus it is a damn good flick.
The sets are wonderful and, along with the simple story line, evoke the feeling of a fairy tale. It seems much grander than the average Hammer horror. The acting is great, the story is excellent, the music is good, the production values are high. It plays like a mini- vampire epic! This film, along with the next year's ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed,"" and ""The Devil Rides Out"" also from 1968, represent the best Hammer had to offer.
Buy this in the Hammer box set from WB. ""The Horror of Dracula"" (which all the stodgy old critics always rave about, ""yawn,"") is good, as are ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""The Mummy."" But the real fun are the late sixties offerings - ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave"" (1968) and ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" and ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" both from 1969.
Hammer never made a film that wasn't at least watchable. But for me their fairy taleish fable, ""Dracula Has Risen Risen From the Grave"" is their high point and their REAL classic.",1082851200,,4189,4.699319727891156

A great scene in the film is when Dracula is put to the stake, and then pulls it right out.

496693,5,6302676835,"Dracula returns from his watery demise in Dracula: Prince of Darkness.  Dracula Has Risen from the Grave is probably the best known film in Hammer's canon after One Million Years BC.  And it is a big, exciting entertainment.  Hammer went all out to load this one with all the ingredients for which they were justly famous: a vicious and sensual title character (Christopher Lee of course), a charming and attractive leading lady (Veronica Carlson, touted at the time as ""Dracula's most beautiful victim!""), an action-packed story-line, and vibrant and colourful visuals courtesy Academy Award-winning cinematographer (no, not for this film!) Freddie Francis, here taking a turn in the director's chair.  Some feel that the story takes too many liberties with vampire lore, but that's just nit-picking.  Hammer created their own vampire mythology, and who's to say what a real vampire might be like anyway?  THIS IS ONE EXCITING FILM!  With one of the most graphic and intense climaxes of any vampire film! Long overdue on DVD.  Thank you, Warner! (Now how about Dracula AD 1972?)",1078963200,,1079,5.1257142857142854

In John Elders script, Lee's character is even more one dimensional, continuing the trend Dracula Prince of Darkness did by giving Lee no dialog.  Many of the scenes were shot through a red colour filter, which strangely falls flat, Freddie Francis direction offers a lot of evil, but just does not live up to promises.  Veronica Carlson is beautiful, the music is great, but the whole movie starts the decline of the quality Hammer Vamps.
Still, is a must for Lee - Dracula fans.",1067990400,4,718,4.813008130081301
496696,4,6302676835,"""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"" opens to the sounds of James Bernard's evocative, ominous main musical theme. Directed by Freddie Francis, the film stars horror icon Christopher Lee in one of his many portrayals of cinema's most celebrated vampire. This version features a lean, effective screenplay by John Elder.
The film opens in a small, pre-industrial village that had previously been terrorized by Dracula, who is presumed to have been destroyed. As the title of the film indicates, however, Dracula soon rises from his grave to begin a new campaign of bloodsucking villainy. His foes in this film are a Catholic monsignor and the boyfriend of the monsignor's lovely niece.
Bernard's solid score is complemented by good art direction. Francis makes effective use of forest and rooftop settings as Dracula pursues his ends. Lee gets solid support from the rest of the cast. Barry Andrews makes a particularly appealing young hero as Paul, the boyfriend of the monsignor's niece. I also was impressed by Barbara Ewing's performance as Paul's sexy co-worker.
There is a pronounced sexual feel to vampirism in this film (as in the other Lee Dracula films I have seen), so there is a delicious irony to the fact that one of Dracula's key foes here is a Catholic monsignor, and thus presumably celibate. Also, a religous controversy among Dracula's foes makes for an interesting contrast to their battle against the undead villain. Overall, a well made and solidly entertaining film.",1025913600,17,1486,5.094262295081967
496697,3,6302676835,"Nice entry in the long running Hammer films Dracula series.  Although Peter Cushing is absent, Christopher Lee still sends shudders up your spine.  In this film he is taking revenge on a  Monsiegner who performed an exorcism on his Castle.  The priest is foster father to his pretty niece, who becomes the target of Dracula's revenge.  Dracula is aided by another cleric who has lost his way and fallen under the spell of Dracula. Some bawdy bedroom scenes would fetch this film a PG-13 today. Good film overall.  This VHS release is not available in Widescreen. I could not find the film at all on Laserdisc.  Perhaps it will be released on DVD in the future.",1022284800,,660,4.637931034482759
496698,5,6302676835,"I think this flick is a terrific piece of work. THe dialogue, casting, and setting combine to produce a tremendously satisfying feature.
The plot is outstanding, contrasting the faith of age with the atheism of youth, the two very different yet both attractive women and revenge versus redemption. The plot is simple but compelling. Dracula has risen and has corrupted a weak priest to do his bidding. The Monsignor has blessed Dracula's castle so Dracula decides to kill him. It's interesting to hear Dracula demand who has done this blasphemy against his castle.
Dracula corrupts a beautiful experienced red-headed barmaid to get to the Monsignor's beautiful, virginal blonde niece, Marie. The contrast between the two women is deliberate and striking. Both want the same young man, Paul, an atheist. But both women succumb to Dracula's power. The Monsignor catches Dracula but dies after warning Paul. Paul grabs the corrupted priest to fight Dracula because Paul doesn't believe. The priest fails but Paul discovers the priest's corruption. On the wild flight back to Dracula's castle, Paul & the priest chase Dracula and Marie. In the struggle Paul knocks Dracula over the cliff who falls onto a cross. THe priest tells Paul to pray but Paul can't so the priest does, securing his redemption. After it's over, Paul crosses himself, revealing a new-found faith and securing his redemption in Marie's eyes.

It's a terrific film with weighty questions and answers. It stands alone so if you're looking to get just one Hammer film, this one is it.",1010620800,3,1549,5.074509803921568
496699,4,6302676835,"Christopher Lee's third appearance as the sanquinary Count Dracula. The virtuous niece of a stern monsignor falls under the spell of the resurrected vampire. Her pristine demeanor notwithstanding, she is defiled by evil lusts. As Dracula approaches, she eagerly unbuttons the high collar of her otherwise diaphanous gown and yearns for the kiss of the vampire. As time went on, the implied sex of these Hammer films was more conspicuous. Of course, the penetration is of the fangs-in-the-neck variety, but the sexual symbolism is there. A willing young barmaid with desire in her eyes, her mind clouded by the vampire's mesmerizing mist, gazes with longing on the Prince of Darkness, and rushes to his embrace. Lee's personification of Dracula is by now classic. His towering, menacing presence, draped in the trademark flowing black cape is one of the attractions of the film. Cool and seductive, he also rages with fangs showing and bloodshot eyes glaring. Villagers tremble behind barred doors when evil is ascendant. The director emphasized visual presentation over heart-pounding suspense, but there are enough thrills and chills to satisfy. The typical Hammer traits of great color photography, prominent bosoms, and a 19th century European setting are present. Even if the local villagers of Central Europe do speak with a British accent, so what? Peter Cushing as Van Helsing is absent from this scenario, but viewers won't be disappointed. As a suspense flick, it is a good change of pace from insane killers stalking teenagers. Recommended viewing for horror fans. ;-)",1000771200,3,1578,5.265873015873016

7829618,5,6302676835,"Leaving aside the basic problems with the Dracula series such as the obvious that the concept of Dracula is impossible and the idea that Dracula can only be controlled by using objects associated with Christianity, there are many illogical elements in the series. One primary example is that we are told that Dracula has the power, which we see in all the films, to look at a person, male or female, control their minds, and forces them to do what he, Dracula, wants them to do. Yet, over and over again, people confront him to hurt him, as when they approach him with a cross, and he does not use his power to tell them to drop the cross. Yet in other instances he does tell women and men to take off the cross some wise man (never a wise woman) placed on the sleeping woman to protect her, and he then approaches the woman and bites her. (Note: it is always women he is after  with biting most likely indicating sex.) This failure to use his power is strange. Problems aside, thinking aside, the Dracula series is fun to watch.
This film is the fourth Dracula film produced by the horror experts at Hammer Studios. It is the third featuring Christopher Lee. The first, of course, starred Bela Lugosi. Lee would go on to reluctantly play in a total of seven Dracula films. While he did not talk at all in the second of his roles, he does so on occasions in this film. And, unlike Lugosi, he is very brutal. He does use his hypnotic power in the film several times, but not, curious as usual, at the critical moment.
In his prior film. Dracula played by Lee, dies in water where he is frozen. In this film, a priest falls near where Dracula lies under the frozen water and bleeds, the blood resurrects Dracula, and Dracula makes the priest his slave by using his hypnotic power. Just before the resurrection, a monsignor, places a huge cross on the door of Draculas castle to control the vampire. Dracula decides to take revenge. He goes to the town where the monsignor live, bites a bar maid making her his slave, and then goes after the monsignors niece, a beautiful young woman.",1508803200,,2081,4.447643979057592
