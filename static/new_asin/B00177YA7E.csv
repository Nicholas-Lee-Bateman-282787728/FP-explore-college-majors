8265402,5,B00177YA7E,If there is one UFC PPV to own its this one. UFC 84 was simply fantastic there are submissions and knockout and TKO's. That really keep this DVD going. There are full of great fights and I was never bored during the DVD. It was one of the best ones I own and when my friends want to watch one this is the one I always put in because Its full of Non Stop Action.,1344729600,,361,3.8266666666666667
8265403,5,B00177YA7E,"This is one of the best UFC PPV ever.  ALmost all the fights made it on the PPV.  They are all exciting.  Even the Tito fight, which was a bit slow, was still a great show.  Sherk and BJ, wow.

And Wanderlei Silva.  We now know why he is called the Axe Murderer in America again.

Read the other guys reviews, they know what's up.  I can just say that this event is permantly etched in HD on my DVR.  When it evaporates, I will be getting this DVD.",1225929600,,448,3.943820224719101
8265404,5,B00177YA7E,"B J Penn just knew that UFC 80 was his time. And he knew that he had something to say after he whooped Joe Stevenson with a rear naked choke. And in front of everybody, ""SEAN SHERK, YOU'RE DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!"" Well, as anybody might imagine, Sherk was pissed. And Sherk simply said, ""In order to be the champ, you have to beat the champ, and B J didn't beat me!"" Sherk still says that he did nothing wrong. Only Sean Sherk knows the truth. Now for the real question, can Sherk keep his Lightweight title? That's the main event, and the first of 3 featured fights for UFC 84 ILL WILL!!!

The co-main event is interesting as well, and quite frankly, it could raise some questions. Wanderlei Silva is taking Keith Jardine. This is interesting for several reasons. Let's start with Wanderlei. He's nothing less than a killer when he fights! You don't take the likes of Wanderlei Silva lightly. And even though he lost a unanimous decision to Chuck Liddell in UFC 79, he still fought a great fight. Chuck didn't knock him out either. Now we go to Keith Jardine. If ANYBODY knew who was going to win in UFC 76, it was Keith Jardine. And he proved it. He won a split decision that many thought was unanimous. But with Jardine, you have the other hand. Like, ON THE OTHER HAND, in UFC 71, he was pissed off that he had to take on newcomer, Houston Alexander. As a result, Alexander dismantled Jardine in less than 50 seconds! The crowd went berserk. But, ON THE OTHER HAND, if you go all the way back to UFC 66, it was Keith Jardine who TKO'd Forrest Griffin in the last minute of the first round. So seriously, how's this fight going to play out? Wanderlei Silva makes no bones about it. He wants this fight to end very quickly. Keith Jardine wants to beat Wanderlei and make history. Now just looking at these two, this is the making of either fight of the night, or a highlight reel for years to come!

The third fight that is featured is Lyoto Machida taking on Tito Ortiz. This is supposedly Tito's final fight in the UFC. He made quite the statement at the weigh-ins with his T-shirt. What always makes a Machida fight is the elusiveness of Machida. Tito says that he's sure Machida will have a great future in the UFC, just not with this fight.

Just like in UFC 83, there are 11 fights, and all of them are worth taking a look at. 11 fights that I'll list below. Another event that is quite enjoyable!

Christian Wellisch vs. Shane Carwin: A nightmare from Hungary takes on a man who's yet to fight out of the first round. This fight doesn't make it out of the first minute!

Jason Tan vs. Dong Hyun Kim: Simply put, one man absolutely DOMINATES the entire fight until it is called shortly in the 3rd round. Great fight for one man, way to hang in there for the other fellow.

Jon Koppenhaver vs. Yoshiyuki Yoshida: The War Machine is ready to go to war with man with some serious judo! Well, war or no war, this doesn't even last a minute!

Rich Clementi vs. Terry Etim: How convenient that a man like ""No Love"" Clementi would be in the UFC called ""ILL WILL"" That's great! Giving nothing away from the fight, he starts to have no love for the referee, Yves Lavigne. But the fight goes to a unanimous decision. And it is a good fight!

Rameau Sokoudjou vs. Kazuhiro Nakamura: What do these 2 have in common? They both fought Machida in the UFC, and they both lost to him! And one of them can't continue after the first round.

Ivan Salaverry vs. Rousimar Palhares: All I'm going to say is that this is one of the sweetest endings I've ever seen! It ended in the first round. I loved it!

Thiago Silva vs. Antonio Mendes: Two Brazilians ready to bring it! One of 'em finishes it in the 1st round!

Lyoto Machida vs. Tito Ortiz: People can make this out to be a boring fight. I disagree and say that it stayed interesting, especially near the end of the 3rd round. It still went to a unanimous decision.

Wilson Gouveia vs. Goran Reljic: Wilson has a few things to say about the new man from Croatia. The result is fight of the night with a TKO in the 2nd round.

Wanderlei Silva vs. Keith Jardine: This fight doesn't even go 40 seconds!! What happened? Watch the fight.

B J Penn vs. Sean Sherk: After all has been said and done, the fight is on! It ends after round 3. Hopefully all hatred is quashed because going into the fight, the words were quite bitter.

Some good surprises in lots of these fights! I really enjoyed this one.",1220745600,6,4428,4.350303030303031

This event had a little bit of everything. Actually it had a lot of everything. Knockouts, and not just TKOs but brutal knockouts that had guys on the mat for minutes. Submissions that put guys to sleep were also presented at the hands of UFC newcomers. Enough about that, you should know what to expect by now...this is the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

If you have been keeping up to date with UFC news you would know the controversy with Sean Sherk and his title being taken away from him. Testing positive for the steroid Nandralone post UFC 73 title defense against Hermes Franca, Sherk always claimed his innocence. Will we ever know if he used them? Probably not but the man who won the title at UFC 80 without defeating the ex-champ added fuel to the fire for Sherk. BJ Penn is as confident as ever and finally taking his training seriously. Now holding the title he didn't win from the ex champ, Sherk is looking to have redemption and win what he has worked all his life for. This was a good battle until the end and didn't make it to the final bell. Lets just say the man who won looks about unbeatable right now.

On December 29 07, UFC fans got to witness one of the best fights of the year between Chuck Liddell and Wanderlei Silva. His first time in the octagon in years, Silva was looking to make a huge statement in the LHW division but came up short losing a 3 round decision to Liddell and marked his 3rd loss in a row! People thought his career was coming to an end until he challenged Keith Jardine, a UFC contender waiting for his title shot and coming off a huge win of Chuck Liddell at UFC 76. This fight doesnt make it past the first round, man it doesnt make it past the first minute! but it is just something you have to see. One of the most brutal knockouts I have seen recently and well, it didn't suprise me!

Lyoto Machida, a Brazilian with a undefeated record was definately already in line for a title shot when he challenged Tito Ortiz with what would be Ortiz's last fight ever to take place in the UFC. Machida is one of my favorite fighters. His style is just so amazing and elusive, people cant stand it. Ortiz never seemed to be into the fighting game ever since his second loss to Liddell and wanted to show everyone that he still had a long career ahead of him. Will Machida continue his winning streak or Ortiz come out on top and leave his mark in the UFC?
