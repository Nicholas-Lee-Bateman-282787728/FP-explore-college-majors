Sparks fly when the old-family Audrey gets together with the parvenu Richard  theres fun and fighting and romance in the English countryside!

I have been a fan of British comedy...well, for my entire life, and this show is one of the first I remember. Superbly written, with a great cast and lovely scenery, this is a great show, one that is sure to please the whole family. My family and I love this tape; in fact we have watched it more times than I can count. We all highly recommend this tape to you.

This tape contains four of the half-hour episodes:

Losing Grantleigh Manor  Series 1, episode 1 (September 30, 1979)  With her husband dead, Audrey must sell up and leave Grandleigh Manor, but she has no intention of staying out for long!

The New Owner  Series 1, episode 2 (October 7, 1979)  Horror of horrors, Richard has a secret  hes not English! Can Audrey forgive him for that?

Going to Church  Series 1, episode 3 (October 14, 1979)  When Richard fails to show up to church, Audrey figures that it is now time for her to let him know, in no uncertain terms, just what responsibilities the lord of the manor has.

The Fireplace  Series 1, episode 4 (October 21, 1979)  When Richard rips the old fireplace out of his study, Audrey lectures him on not destroying the nations heritage. So, when Audrey helps Richard buy a horse, he knows just what to give her, his old fireplace. The problem is, she doesnt want it!

By the way, if you liked this tape (and you will), then try to get Peter Spences novel of the same name. It is the basis for the show, but has some delightful differences!",1461369600,,2016,4.602240896358543

7925064,5,B00004WG36,"This is a wonderful series. I have only seen Volumes 1 and 2 so far,(8 episodes)but I can't wait to see the rest.

The humor and acting are great,and so is the chemistry between the two leads.

I also appreciate that the language and humor is 'clean'. Although the female lead's character is far from an admirable person, it is handled amazingly well and non-offensively. Terrific job from the writers to be able to accomplish this so well.

Anyone who appreciates great humor that is non-offensive should not be disappointed in this series. The scenery is a treat,as well.",1202601600,,573,4.767676767676767
