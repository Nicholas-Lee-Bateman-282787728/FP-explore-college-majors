5101586,5,B007OWPR6E,"I live in NYC, so I've been taking the Kettlebell Kickboxing classes for some time. Dasha Is a great instructor, and I could not wait to purchase the DVDs.

There are 4 DVDs in the set, with each DVD focusing on different muscles.  Believe me, after doing one DVD, your whole body will be feeling it!

I was afraid that exercising with the DVDs would be a letdown in comparison to the class.  I didn't need to be concerned at all.  They are just as challenging as being there!  Dasha shows alternative moves for those who are new to the world of kettle bells.  It truly is for everyone at all levels.

Since doing the DVDs, I have definitely felt my core getting stronger, and my cardio fitness improving.  I've dropped several inches from my waist and have had to buy new clothes, which has been pretty awesome!

I've tried many DVDs at home, and I'm one of the first to say that doing exercise at home is very hard to commit to.  This is the only workout that I have wanted to do and have done consistently (at least 3 times a week.)

For those who want to jump start their exercise routine and thrive on a challenge, these DVDs are it!",1335571200,5,1138,4.291079812206573
5101587,4,B007OWPR6E,"I'm 59 years old and one would think its too much for my age....a little, but I challenge myself in exercise and this is great for that.  There are some exercise routines that I adjust for me.  I still get the benefits.  It's a great addition to  one's exercise routine....try it!",1467158400,2,280,4.431372549019608
5101588,4,B007OWPR6E,LOVE this workout series!! It is the best Kettlebell workout DVD I have found this far. My only complaint is she mumbles alittle so you have to strain your ears to hear her.,1457827200,,173,4.2727272727272725
5101589,5,B007OWPR6E,I was looking for A workout that would be challenging and different and I definitely found both with this series. I love the mix of kettle bell and martial arts. I especially like the ab workout! Highly recommend!,1457568000,3,213,4.631578947368421
5101590,1,B007OWPR6E,"I have never been so disappointed in a product in my life. The workouts in this program are awfully boring and beyond basic with no intention of pushing athletic ability in any way. The instructor is dull, monotone, and seems to not know what is going on within her own workout program. If you have any athletic ability whatsoever, and do not have any medical problems keeping you from doing a real workout, then I would recommend this program.

Also, the customer service is horrible.  I reached out immediately after ordering this product about an error in my order and never heard back. I gave up on hoping for a response after a month.",1455148800,2,639,4.5964912280701755
5101591,5,B007OWPR6E,Didn't play! Something was wrong with the DVD. I really wanted to try this out because this series is supposed to be great!,1454803200,,123,4.391304347826087

5101595,3,B007OWPR6E,"I purchased this DVD series here on amazon and have been doing it off and on for about two months. OK, here is what I think of the series:
1. It combines kickboxing and cardio moves with Kettlebell weight training which is a great all over the body workout, so I was so excited to try it.
2. You will work up a sweat and improve your upper body strength, I have super scrawny arms and I started with a 10lb kettlebell for this workout. 5lbs was too easy for me.
There are four discs in the set, each about 40min long (10min warm up and 30min workout). I gave this set 3 stars because even though the workout is good, it really is the same moves over and over again for all four discs. And the music sucks, the movements do not sync with the music. I usually play my own workout mix and mute the video. And Dasha, talks waaaay tooo much during the entire workout. Basically her idea for a workout is good, but the execution and overall production quality needs work. It is really easy to lose interest in this series because the music is lame and her constant talking ruin it. There is nothing ""fun"" about the series or something to make it pop. If you can get past that, then you might actually love this workout. But as I stated in the beginning I couldn't keep myself consistently interested in it. I prefer Chalene Johnson and the TurboKick/TurboFire series. If you like good music and dancing combined with kickboxing then you will love it. I tried this DVD series because I wanted to get into kettlebell, but it wasn't what I was looking for.",1444694400,4,1547,4.337931034482758
5101596,4,B007OWPR6E,"I think this workout is great...however; listening to Dasha repeatedly talk about sexy bodies and looking good in short skirts makes me feel guilty for even owning this workout. I, personally; love to see muscular women. I love having muscles and being strong. I guess I just assumed that a martial artist would stress the importance of strength and fitness over how good you'll look in a dress. It's really really disappointing.
Maybe when I'm more accustomed to the workout i can just turn off the sound and listen to music.",1443744000,4,526,4.791208791208791
5101597,5,B007OWPR6E,I have had this series for some time and love to mix it up into my workout schedule. Every time I do one of these workouts I always feel sore and they work out your whole body. No matter how many times I do these I still love them. It goes by quick and they give you a 1 minute cool down period between sets. As you get more advanced I just bought more weight to see better results. This is the best DVD series I have ever bought and so not get sick of it. I do mute the TV and turn my own music own during the videos.,1442620800,2,518,3.7181818181818183

5101599,5,B007OWPR6E,"I really enjoy Dasha Libin and the Kettlebell Kickboxing series.  I know she seems to annoy some people, but I find her charming.  Cute and fun!  These are higher energy - and definitely kick my butt.  For reference, I am an intermediate-level exerciser and had a baby about 5 months ago.  I wear a heart rate monitor during these workouts and my heart stays up in the 80%'s- often creeping into the 90%'s on certain moves.  I never reach the magic 500 calories burned- possibly because I can't go as fast as they do on the screen.  I am usually in the 380-420 Calorie range for the full 40 minutes.  I'm still working to get my pre-pregnancy strength back, so I am using a 15 pound kettlebell with this video.  While I was once doing it 3 times per week, I have now dropped down to about once per week after a couple of months because there are other kettlebell videos / instructors I like to incorporate as well.  Particularly Lauren Brooks (Kettlebell Body and Kettlebell Revelation) because they are slower paced, but I can use much heavier weights to build strength.  I find it's nice to mix it up.  But even after a few months working out with Dasha, I still want to die about halfway through her videos!  That's a good thing!  A great, fun workout to add in to my mix of Kettlebells, Yoga, Pilates and Bodyweight Training weekly!  Highly recommend!!!",1438041600,6,1357,4.504098360655738
5101600,5,B007OWPR6E,"I've had this DVD set about a year, and although I only have time to work out once or twice a week at most, it is my favorite workout DVD. The four discs allow me to switch out routines so I don't get bored. Each DVD has a different focus. It is amazing how good of a workout you can get just by swinging a kettlebell around. Most of the movements are easy (I say ""most"" because there are some burpees that my knees don't like). But, I just skip those parts or do a different movement. It is also helpful that one of the people in the video does a modified form so you don't feel like it is just for jocks. Some people say her narrative is annoying but I don't mind it. She does it to motivate and educate. And, if you do find it annoying, you have the option to play it without the narrative or without the music track.",1437696000,,820,4.0060975609756095
5101601,5,B007OWPR6E,Can't say enough about this scorcher series. I'd been an avid runner for years until my knees started to act up. Was hard trying to find something that would give me the same results and intensity. This dvd will have your heart pumping asap and your body sore for days - which is what I wanted. Slims down your entire body - especially the legs. Would highly recommend adding this to any workout routine.,1436140800,,404,4.472972972972973
5101602,5,B007OWPR6E,"I love ALL of Dasha's DVDs. I recommend them all. If you combine all of them--they are a great way to get in shape and trick your body into not getting bored. I feel stronger and leaner. I find that she coaches you instead of belittles you--she doesn't yell--she coaches. She is encouraging and reminds you to tune into your body. And most importantly, she teaches you to breath correctly. I love her motivation and her community she's built surrounding all of her programs. Check out the previews on YouTube. Her program might not be for everybody, but her program works for me.",1434758400,,579,4.631067961165049
5101603,5,B007OWPR6E,"I've done other kettlebell work outs and they were good, but I tend to get a bit bored with just 1 or 2 dvds. I decided to try Dasha's, because I liked the idea of also incorporating kickboxing. I love love love this workout. I've been doing it now consistently for a little over 4 months and I'm still excited to workout with them. After I've consistently worked out for 6 or 7 months, I will treat myself to another one of her workout series. I still have a ways to go on my weight-loss journey, and look forward to trying some of the other workout DVD's she has",1430784000,,564,4.18348623853211
5101604,4,B007OWPR6E,I like it! I like the combo of kickboxing and kettle bells.,1430352000,,59,4.0
5101605,5,B007OWPR6E,Excellent workout!  Dasha explains everything!  It is an intense and effective workout!,1429747200,,87,6.166666666666667
5101606,4,B007OWPR6E,"I like the workouts.  I like their length.  I like the set.  I like kettlebells.  But bottom line:  I'd like this series more with a different instructor.  This instructor doesn't mirror cue, she has a sassy (another reviewer called it ""street tough"") attitude I'm not particularly fond of, she claims she invented exercises you've seen since before, and she talks non-stop in a shrill voice.  You may say to yourself you don't mind non-stop talking or that you won't even hear it anyway because you keep the volume down low.  I was once like you.  My survival tactic seems to be to tune her out or turn off the volume altogether, which is too bad because she does give some form tips.  It's kind of like shopping at TJ Maxx:  you'll find some hidden gems, but you might also give up after getting overwhelmed looking for them.

I also bristle a little whenever workouts are labeled as ""female only,"" because it usually means you won't be able to lift a heavy enough weight with their higher reps to gain significant muscle (newsflash to these instructors:  it's not just men who want all the incredible benefits that go getting a lot of muscle).  This is no big exception -- the instructor clearly says many times over that speed is preferred and that you should increase your speed rather than your weights as you advance -- , though you can pull out your heavier 'bells for the few sets of swings and other traditional kettlebell moves that do find their way in.

""Female only"" workouts tend also to have talk of getting you to look sexy (just look at KBKB's website and their bikini challenges.)  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I know some mothers who keep the ""you should strive to be sexy"" workouts away from their daughters (surely women get enough pressure on how to look and so much less encouragement on being healthy and strong), so I point it out that it is here in case that matters to you.

This is definitely more cardio than strength, but you'll get strength too.  In my case, it's been good for coming back to working out after having to take some time off.  This is not quite an advanced set; I'd put it around low- to high-intermediate depending on which weights you select.  It's nice they show someone do the workout with a dumbbell; you don't need to buy a kettlebell just for this.  The background exercisers are all women around the same age, skill level, and slim physique.  I kind of like when there is a greater mix shown, but that's a minor quibble.

I would highly, highly recommend looking elsewhere for kettlebell form pointers.  They're practically non-existent here, but you can find plenty of youtube clips by reputable kettlebellers.  Do that first thing.  Also I tend not to do the abs workout because some of the moves look a little iffy according to the newer back research (Stuart McGill, etc.)  I've just been doing the other workouts every other day, along with my walking and some other exercise I like to do.

If you want a workout with a similar style yet (in my opinion) done more professionally and perhaps a little more oriented for advanced exercisers, try Ilaria's Atlectica.",1429660800,6,3140,4.6292947558770345
5101607,5,B007OWPR6E,"Really love the exercise routines. They get your heart pumping. Not the best kettlebell instruction or demonstration of proper form so I suggest sticking with very light, aerobic weight bells (5-10lbs) if you are new to them and using this DVD as your intro. If you have experienced proper in-person instruction or studied from DVD's like SKOGG, Lauren Brooks or the MB45 series' you can go heavier I would say to enhance the strength and muscle building aspects.

The concept here is good.  maximize your workout with body weight and weighted movements that activate your heart rate and use multiple muscle groups efficiently, strengthening and stretching often at the same time.  The martial arts aspect keeps it fun as well as the variety between the four workouts, a good job of introducing new moves.",1429228800,3,805,4.992537313432836
5101608,5,B007OWPR6E,"Whenever I feel like I have lost a little momentum in my weight training and fitness plans, I pop in these DVDs and get right back on track. Dasha makes kettle bell movements fun, but still manages to produce a high-intensity workout that yields immediate results. I use the videos religiously as I can always count on them to guide me through an effective workout that I will be able to call upon for the rest of my life. This series is an option for EVERYONE, no matter one's current level of fitness. Its' a great place for beginners to start, and for pros to continue building from.",1428537600,,586,4.435185185185185
5101609,5,B007OWPR6E,"Best Kettleball Workout Ever!!  I have dozens of DVD workouts. I love all of Shawn T's worrkouts.  Insanity, T25, and Insanity the Asylum.  But this workout really targets ""trouble zones"".  My stomach is flatter, my legs are toner and it even is improving my posture.  And it does all this in about 35 to 45 minutes daily.  This work out is not easy, but it is the most rewarding (especially in terms of results) I have tried in several years. When I do the routines, I am using a 12 lb to 20 lb kettleball.  It really keeps you challenged, and I am hoping to finally fit back into a two piece bathing suit by summer.",1426464000,11,617,4.267241379310345
5101610,5,B007OWPR6E,"These are great workouts!  Have all three sets of her DVDs and just love them.  Dasha is so right about following a program!!  With these workouts and her guided program, I have lost twenty pounds, feel great, and have much better mobility, strength and balance.  This has become my go to program for over a year now and for many more to come.  Dasha is so positive, provides great guidance on form and you just get the sense she really cares and loves what she does.  Kudos to her programs!!",1422921600,,492,4.411111111111111
5101611,5,B007OWPR6E,"This set really mixes up the traditional kettlebell work out. I love kettle bells but it's nice to throw in different, safe movements for variety. Was pretty sore after the first video so no complaints here!",1419897600,,207,4.777777777777778
5101612,3,B007OWPR6E,Some good workouts.  Dasha is a little annoying.,1419724800,,48,5.0
5101613,5,B007OWPR6E,GREAT workout.,1418774400,,14,6.5
5101614,5,B007OWPR6E,"I have to say, I NEVER write reviews on Amazon, but this DVD set is that good. I waited a few months so that I could use the set for awhile and write a more accurate review. First off, I'm 24 years old and 5'7"" with an athletic build, for reference. I have always been muscular, especially in the legs. I am also not a cardio fan - I am not a good runner or jogger, but since I learned that I have a heart arrhythmia I was told that I need to 'get my heart in shape.' I picked this set up because I normally only work with weights and do some interval training. Since starting this series, I honestly don't really need to do the weights or the interval training anymore.  I only do the workouts 2-3 days a week because I am a student and work, but I have seen great results. I am getting more toned, I feel stronger, and my clothes are fitting better and better.

Dasha Libin is likable, she gives great tips, and she knows how to make workouts extremely efficient. I didn't buy this to lose weight, but I have not changed anything about my diet and I've lost 5 pounds in a month - seriously, I still eat pizza, pasta, bread, rice, dessert... it almost seems too good to be true. I also have bad knees and shoulders from years and years of being an athlete; Dasha's routines never hurt my knees and never make my shoulders pop. I won't lie, they are difficult. I have to stop and rest often, but it gets easier the more you do it. If you are someone with bad joints or who has trouble doing squats/lunges because of knee pain (like me), or if you're looking to change up your routine, then you should really give this a try. :)",1418428800,10,1627,4.1455696202531644

5101616,5,B007OWPR6E,Good 4 disc set. The warm up and cool down are a little long and boring and I am not a fan of the breaks after each set. Other than that I enjoy them and think they are worth it.,1417305600,,178,3.475
5101617,4,B007OWPR6E,"I like these workouts with the exception of the last one.  It is too much on the floor for me with tailbone issues.

5101622,5,B007OWPR6E,"Ive been exercising at home for several years. I like variety so i have many different types of DVDs (taebo, P90X, HipHop Abs, Yoga, Pilates, etc), but the Scorcher Series is by far my favorite workout. I began with the intermediate program and saw results in under 3 weeks. Tighter arms, thighs, abs. The best part is the increase in stamina. I can run to catch my train in less time, with better form & feel less winded afterwards. Thats when you really feel the rewards of these workouts. I started with 5lb kettlebell and now 4 weeks later im using 11lbs with little difficulty. For some of the abdominal workouts i bring the weight down to 5-8lbs. Another thing I love about the Scorcher Series is that even though your getting an amazing workout and breaking a crazy sweat, there is no pain in any part of my body.  All the moves are well balanced and evenly distributed for a full body workout. Some moves are very challenging but not impossible & once completed I feel such a sense of accomplishment. I highly recommend Scorcher Series for anyone looking to look great and feel great.",1413936000,8,1092,4.571428571428571
5101623,5,B007OWPR6E,"This is really an amazing workout program.... I have been doing it a little less than three weeks and my body is changing visibly.  It makes you strong and lean.  My only suggestion to anyone new to Kettlebell training is to make sure that your form is correct.  There isn't really anything that really goes over the proper swing  form.  Other than that it is an amazing full body workout....you really only need to do the suggested routines three days a week to start getting results.

5101626,5,B007OWPR6E,"I enjoy these DVDs so much I bought Dasha Libin's 11-DVD series.  I appreciate the variety, intensity, and efficiency of these workouts.  I have been using kettlebells for about 2 years and find these workouts challenging and fun.  I don't mind Dasha's (yes, constant) talking-- it's kind of charming, and distracting in a good way.  For me, these DVDs have been a great complement to more traditional kettlebell workouts (e.g., Lauren Brooks).  For reference - in case it's helpful, I use a 20 lb kettlebell for most of the movements, and sometimes drop to an 18 lb or move up for two-handed swings to a 26 lb.  Outside of these DVDs I use a 35 lb for 2-handed swings and a 45-lb bell for heavy swings.  I have problem ankles so I avoid super high-impact stuff; I don't have trouble with these workouts, but the few higher-impact moves involved can be easily modified.",1408838400,4,869,4.640522875816994
5101627,5,B007OWPR6E,"I've been working out and have really gotten into crossfit the last year. So when I saw this, I didn't think it was going to do much for me, being that I do a lot of HIIT workouts and what not, but I absolutely loved this workout. It got my heartbeat up and stayed up the whole 30 minutes. There is a woman in the workout doing advanced moves and one woman doing an easier version of the movements. The spokeswoman was energetic and pleasant to watch; not annoying like some others you'll find.

(If you've been working out for a while, I would suggest a 12-15 lb kettlebell, but for beginners, you should start with a 5-8 lb kettlebell.)",1406073600,4,638,4.316666666666666
5101628,4,B007OWPR6E,I find that I get a great cardiovascular and all over body workout with these DVDs- I typically do my cardio on the treadmill so this is a great way to mix it up and the workouts are pretty fun so they do go quickly. I really appreciate the countdowns on the exercises and there are breaks between sets that give you enough time to grab some water without having to pause it. However these workouts won't replace actual weight lifting to build muscle particularly in the upper body. For me this is more cardio/all over conditioning and strengthening. I don't have a kettlebell so I have been using a 10 lb dumbbell.,1405987200,3,615,4.451327433628318

I got in great shape a few years back with kickboxing/heavy bags, and these workouts combine the best of  kickboxing moves with kettles, so even thou there is no heavy bag, the moves, transitions, speed of workouts feel great, powerful and MOST important safe, precisely because of Dasha's ""constant"" talking, which I prefer to call it ""coaching"".  If you like empowering workouts this might be great for you!

Yes, the cardio parts use kickboxing moves, but it's not super exciting.  I've done hundreds, maybe thousands of workout tapes (still have a ton of VHS ones), as well as DVDs and the instructor in this set is annoying to listen to.  Also, I've purchased a ton of workout DVDs from amazon.com and even more since purchasing this set and I cannot tell you how many are damaged.

I'd been doing Tae Bo and Jillian Michael workouts.  I needed a change.  I'd used a kettlebell in Jillian's workouts and like the cardio of Tae Bo...so this seemed like a natural fit.  I LOVE it.  Dasha is a bit of talker...but after 3 weeks, the results are amazing.  My arms are much more firm and my abs...well...I have them.  Dasha assumes you know the kettlebell moves; it's not for a beginner.  I also purchased Iron Core Kettlebell (it was $8).  I highly recommend you use this workout first.

5101639,5,B007OWPR6E,"I am a 34 year old sedentary female who has never enjoyed activity or fitness until I tried the Kettlebell Scorcher Series. My poor eating habits and unhealthy lifestyle had caught up to me in the form of belly weight and low energy so I decided to try Dasha's Kettlebell class in Manhattan.

I couldn't stick to a fitness routine for more than a couple of weeks and generally hated exercise but seeing results with Dasha's kettle bells motivated me to keep doing the program. After 3 sessions, my abs, hamstrings, and glutes felt more toned. I was shocked. My body probably couldn't build muscle that quickly but the feeling was enough to motivate me to stick with it.

I couldn't make it to Dasha's class because of work so I purchased the scorcher series. I preferred the Scorcher series to her class because it was only 25 minutes of activity (10 minutes of warm up and cool down), cheaper (one class is $15), and I could do it on my schedule in the privacy of my home.

I have been doing the dvds 3-4 days a week on and off for about 7-8 months and it's made a big improvement in my life.  Physically I am more toned but more importantly, my attitude about fitness has changed in a lot of ways. As someone who didn't see themselves as 'fit', I never tried any physical activity.  I preferred to watch from the sidelines.  This scorcher series opened my mind to finally learning tennis which I have started to play once or twice a week and hiking.  The addition of tennis and hiking to my kettle bell routine has made a drastic change in my legs. They have gotten thin and sculpted out.  I always had somewhat slim legs but they lacked definition and my thighs were bigger than my calves, resulting in a V shape. Now that my calves have toned up, they have gotten slightly bigger, and dip in before my knees and my thighs are thinner, giving me a shapely leg. No more V legs!

If it worked for me, it could work for you.  It's worth a try.",1393372800,7,1943,4.342541436464089

5101645,5,B007OWPR6E,"I absolutely love this DVD set. I would consider myself a low to mid Intermediate exerciser, and found the workouts suitably challenging but not impossible. There's certainly enough variation and challenge to keep me on my toes and inspire future improvement and growth!

Some reviewers have mentioned Dasha's constant talking. Yes, it is constant, but it doesn't bother me in the slightest. In fact, I like the talking - it is unpretentious, motivating and quite funny at times! It keeps me on track and focused, but in a light-hearted way. I feel encouraged and supported, as though Dasha is actually in the room directing and guiding me.

I have been doing the DVDs for a couple of weeks. I haven't seen particular results yet, but I know this is because my eating has been very poor in this timeframe. My body has felt stronger though, and every workout hits the spot in terms of calorie burn, the feeling of having been challenged and worked really hard! (On this topic, my calorie burn is between 300-350 per session, excluding Diversity, which is lower again because it is ab-focused). This is likely due to my height - 5'2"" - and my weight, which is semi-low - 132lb/60kg.

I would definitely advise you to watch the introductory video before starting the routines, as it's easy to misunderstand some of the moves - especially the swing! I did this move incorrectly during the first workout (squatting, instead of hinging at the hips) and subsequently gave myself a crazy inner thigh ache for the next few days! Fortunately, I figured out what had happened and paid better attention to my form next time. She is very good at giving directions and explaining how to do (and not do!) the moves - I just rushed a little bit and didn't pay quite enough attention the first time!

In short, I LOVE this workout and really look forward to doing it each day. Sometimes I want to do more of the routines but remember that Dasha talks about how important the rest days are! It takes no time at all, yet packs a crazy punch and makes you feel AMAZING. I can't wait to see what the program has in store for me and my weight loss and fitness!

P.S. I love this series so much, I've ordered the other KBKB DVD set - ""The Body Series"". This looks fabulous as well!",1382400000,4,2258,4.565432098765432
5101646,2,B007OWPR6E,"I was really hopeful about his DVD set.  I like kickboxing and kettlebells and was looking for something to get rid of some of the fat pockets between the waist and knees that just doesn't seem to move no matter what.  Before this, I used Jillian Michels DVD for several years. I lost 2 sizes (worked out 4-5x per week for 1/2 hour) and was just hoping to target some stubborn areas with a new routine. I like routines that stay to 30 minutes as I have a job and 3 kids.

I started with the beginner suggestion routine but didn't see any results.  After 3 weeks I moved to the moderate program.  I ended up doing all four disc's at least one time per week.  I used a 15lb kettle bell for most exercises (they use 10lb in the video) except the floor work out where I used an 8 lb wieght.
The abdominal work out DVD is defective and constantly stops in the middle of the routine so that was really discouraging.

After 3 months or so I lost about an inch around the abdominal area. I never lost a single lb in 9 months. I eat healthy.  I gained a bit of strength in the arms and shoulder but I LOST strength in my quads.  This workout does not tax them at all. The only way I could begin to lose weight (1/2lb per week or so) was to add in Jillians Blast Fat, Boost Metabolism DVD in between work outs.

Unfortunately this workout is not complete.  Not enough quad work to keep existing muscle tone or aerobic work.  I bought this workout because the workouts were advertised as 30 minutes, most were longer, up to 45 minutes without getting extra results for the time spent.  You get winded and sweaty BUT I felt the results should show.

I can't say that I would buy it again, knowing what I know now.  It just didn't do the job.",1382313600,12,1729,4.181268882175226

If you are younger, or in better shape than me, you can do all of her workout without modifications, or use heavier Kettlebells and you will get a fantastic work out.

Before this tape, I had done several weeks of a Kettlebell workout, but no kickboxing, and the kickboxing makes a huge difference in the aerobic workout. Kettlebells alone do not give an aerobic workout.

I had only been able to do 5 pushups in a row, and that was difficult. After 5 weeks of doing a workout with Kettlebells, I can do 15 pushups with ease. I am also starting to do some of the movements with a 15 lb. Kettlebell, but for the fast movements I will stick to 10 lbs.",1379980800,5,926,4.138888888888889

5101651,4,B007OWPR6E,"Pros:  These are good total body workouts.  They are geared toward lighter weight and more cardio if you are looking for that.  If you're looking for something to put on a bit more muscle, using heavier weight with fewer reps, then these DVD's probably aren't quite as appropriate for that. But still, the workout is good for what it is.

Cons: The instructor talks nonstop and tries to project a bit of a street tough persona, both of which are a bit annoying.  I feel like she should only be marketing these videos to 22 year old girls.  She constantly tries to motivate during the workouts by saying things like I will be able to do more push-ups than my boyfriend or dad.  Boyfriend or dad????  Really?  That target audience is definitely not middle-aged fitness-minded married women.  Also, she provides lots of attempted motivations during the workouts by telling me how great I'll look in all my tight clothes.  I don't mind a little of that, but for me these videos are a little too much.  It just feels a little juvenile to me.

Having said all of that, since overall the workouts are good, I'll give the DVDs a 4.  I still use them from time to time, but they're not my favorites.",1375315200,14,1190,4.5

I tried the Diversity once and while it was fine, if I am going to do 30 minutes of mostly ab work - I want to feel it the next day, and I did not with that workout. I like the format of the workouts - feels good to push myself in one-minute intervals - I am definitely sweating by the end of each workout. The format also keeps the boredom factor low. The instructor does talk non-stop, and I mean non-stop, but most days, I just turn the volume down and listen to other music or the television instead of her. After doing each workout once, you really do not need her instruction - the moves are not complicated and she really isn't giving too many pointers on form.

I had read about Dasha and her studio but being a Cali girl, I'm unable to attend one of her studio classes.  I decided to give her DVD series a try and it is honestly one of the best investments I've ever made.  Each video is between 35-40 minutes of intense kick boxing and kettlebell moves.  In this amount of time, Dasha claims you will burn 500 calories and she delivers! My Polar F6 says I burned from 500-650 with each DVD....in 30 min!! I am 5'6"" in my 30s and weigh 135. This is golden for me because I don't have time to put in 60 minutes of workout time. I have been using these DVDs for the past 3 weeks and I've seen some great results.  My abs are much flatter and my butt has lifted significantly.  If you're looking for a quick no nonsense workout that delivers, this is it.  Dasha is very personable and although she does get a bit chatty, I like it because she distracts me from the burning in my muscles.  Don't expect classic kettlebell form.

5101662,5,B007OWPR6E,"I'm in love with this workout series!  I'm a pretty avid home fitness user, and have relied on Jillian Michaels videos (I own them all) to help meet my fitness goals.  I lost over a 100 pounds working out with them and eating right in about a year, and I'm finally at my goal weight.  However, if you know Jillian videos you know that a lot of moves are repeat moves, and I really needed something new and exciting...specifically to achieve some final definition and tone.

I love kettlebells and came across this DVD on amazon.  On the first day of using it, I stacked two of Dasha's dvds for an hour long workout.  I hate to continue comparing to Jillian, but I've never been compelled to go for a second round of her workouts after doing one.  This was different though.  I was pouring sweat, the moves were innovative & fun, and clearly isolated my remaining problem areas (such as that tiny pooch in the lower abdomen, hips, and butt).  I am HOOKED.  The great thing about kettlebells is the ability to combine cardio and strength into one workout, so you're really getting a 2 for 1.  No need to add in substitute cardio after doing this, which is great because I simply dread running in the winter.

The reviews are correct in saying that Dasha talks and talks and talks and....talks.  There is *rarely* a silent moment.  This doesn't detract from the quality of the workout though.  You have a mute button for a reason.  I mute the DVD and play my own music in the background, so this is really a non-factor in my opinion.

I'm very happy with this purchase, for the mere fact that it's almost plateau-proof.  There are four DVDS that you can rotate as you wish to increase muscle confusion.  On top of that, you can increase the weight of your kettlebell as you progress.  I started the warm up with a 10 lb bell and it was way too light.  I quickly switched to my 15 and will continue to use that for 3-4 weeks until increasing.  I'll definitely update this review in a month or so with my progress.  =)

*UPDATE* 3/10/13 -- I'm down 14 pounds!  I do cardio 2-3 days a week, (usually the stepmill/stairmaster) at the gym, and do one of these dvds the other 3 days of the week.  I've also noticed a VAST improvement in my cellulite.  Last summer I was thin but still had horrible cellulite on the back of my thighs.  It looks so much better after two months of this dvd and clean eating.  I'll definitely be buying short shorts this summer and I couldn't be happier!",1357344000,7,2475,4.389867841409692
5101663,1,B007OWPR6E,"I purchased this from another retailer (not Amazon) for variety; I've been training with Kettlebells for over three years and I'm always looking to add to my DVD collection.  This was one of the worse purchases I've made.  The instructor is nice, but she talks way too much.  Also, her form is not great on several of her moves; she clearly has not been certified in kettlebell training.

This may be fine for people who enjoy her ""class"" in NY, but it is not a good purchase for those who wish to learn kettlebells from the ground up.  I recommend DVD's by Lauren Brooks or Anthony Diluglio; they offer much better instruction on form, kettlebell selection, etc.  Some of their DVD's may seem expensive, but they are well worth the investment.  Additionally, Amy Bento Ross is another good trainer; her ""KB2"" (kickboxing and kettlebells; advanced workout) is much better than this ""Scorcher Series"".  Her kettlebell dynamics video is also a fantastic workout.  Each of these trainers is certified in Russian Kettlebell training.  See also, Keith Weber (awesome) and Tracy Reifkind (great swing instruction).

Overall, this four DVD set by Dasha Libin is overpriced and overrated.

I actually look forward to working out which is not usually the case!  I'm excited to workout mostly because of the results I've seen in only 3 weeks.  I do enjoy the workouts - all 4 of them are difficult but I am still able to do them.  You can modify all of the moves if needed and work up to the more advanced movements.

I've never heard of Dasha before but I really hope she will release more workout DVDs since this one is fantastic.  Her form is excellent and she does not rush through the exercises.  I do recommend you watch the DVD first if you are new to kettlebells so that you can see the correct form when doing the moves. Also, I don't mind that Dasha chats a lot.  It actually makes the experience more personable and real instead of overly rehearsed like most workout videos. Plus she can be funny sometimes.

So far  I've been doing it for 2 weeks and I'm already seeing definition in my abs.  Also, kettlebells are just a fun and convenient exercise to do at home.  Very highly recommended.  Release more videos Dasha!

5101669,4,B007OWPR6E,"I found this DVD to be a great workout for me.  While some complain that the instructor talks too much -I didn't find this irritating - she tries to make sure your form is correct, as well as explaining the purpose of a particular exercise.  I like the fact that there are 4 other ladies training alongside Dasha and they show differing intensity levels of each exercise.  For a beginner this is a great option.  You can choose to do the warm up/cool down or skip them - and choose with or without the background music.  The minute countdown for each exercise plus the overall workout countdown is wonderful - so you know exactly where you stand - especially helpful for those if us who do our workouts early in the morning before getting kids and husbands off to school and work.",1346025600,7,780,4.464788732394366
5101670,4,B007OWPR6E,"I've taken Dasha's class in New York City many times, but often my schedule is too hectic to allow me to go more than once a week. The Kettlebell Kickboxing DVDs have been awesome for supplementing real classes, and they're just great as an at-home workout, especially if you hate going to the gym like I do. Kettlebell gets a lot done in a little time, with moves targeting multiple areas of the body all at once. Working out with Dasha will have you feeling fitter and stronger, and the 4 DVDs allow you to switch up your routine to avoid getting bored and always create a challenge for yourself.",1341792000,6,598,4.445454545454545
5101671,5,B007OWPR6E,"I'm so glad that I found the Kettlebell Kickboxing Scorcher Series because it absolutely works! I've been using the DVDs for a month now, and I am experiencing great results. When I turned 50 a year ago, I started working out 5-6 times a week. I've mostly used Jillian Michaels DVDs, but others as well. Though I still love those workouts (and lost about 20 pounds in the process of using them), I am seeing more physical changes with this Kettlebell Kickboxing series than any of the other workouts that I've done. I still use the others as an ""extra"" day sometimes, but I don't feel guilty about my rest days thanks to Dasha's guidelines.

At 51, and just one month into these DVDs, I feel strong, confident, and balanced. Others have mentioned that Dasha talks too much, but it actually makes me laugh when she says, ""I have to stop talking now,"" and then keeps going. Her cueing is fabulous, and I appreciate her encouraging words throughout. I don't like group classes, so I probably wouldn't go to her live class even if I lived close enough to attend. These DVDs are just perfect for me, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for an effective and challenging workout at home!",1340755200,38,1190,4.586854460093897
5101672,5,B007OWPR6E,"i have been doing this workout for a couple weeks and love it.  there are 4 dvds.  i love all of them.  they are challenging workouts and just when your heart is pumping like crazy and you need to take a break, she gives it to you.  there are 4 one minute intervals followed by about a minute of rest.  this is repeated 3 times.  the first two intervals are the same - just switching sides.  the third is different and works both sides.  with the 4 dvds and the way the intervals are laid out,  you will not get bored.  very fun.  not really for beginners.  i am not in the best shape - about 30 pounds overweight.  but my stamina is very high.  i am actually mixing this workout with insanity.  i  am seeing results slowly only because of a medical issue.  (thyroid)  so i have to work extra hard.  this is recommended for you ladies who like to get your heart pumping and get a kick ass workout.  also for you kettlebell enthusiasts - i have many kbell dvds... and this one is different but she does show great form unlike brooke benton.  there is an instructional section where she shows you proper form.  if you are new to kettlebells id use 10 pounds or less.  i am using 15 and find it quite challenging.  those who are experienced with kettlebells i recommend starting with 10-15 just to get the ""swing"" of things, because it is a bit different and there are some plyo kickboxing segments at the end of each interval.  also,  i did find dasha's voice a tad annoying at first but i have fell in love with the workout and can get past it.  i believe it is her first set of dvds and they did a great job.  i really hope to see more from her.",1339804800,5,1645,4.169329073482428
5101673,5,B007OWPR6E,"I've done everything from yoga to spinning to TaeBo (remember Billy Blanks?) to P90X to pilates and back. I have been training with Dasha in her sold out class in NYC for over a year, and KB has been the most rewarding workout of my life! I leave each class feeling exhausted, challenged, and ready for another go! The results have been amazing!

I am very excited for these DVDs because I have been so eager to introduce my latest workout obsession to my family and friends who are too far or too busy to make it to Dasha's live class.

KB Scorcher Series DVDs are a great & quick workout! They are shorter than Dasha's live workouts but still pack a punch.  I burn anywhere from 500-600 calories per workout! After each workout I'm drenched in sweat, but feeling energized.

The Series includes 4 different workouts which you can combine 2 at a time to get a mega workout or one at a time so you can spread them across the week. My favorite combination is the Power DVD (by far the most challenging of the 4 because of some serious high impact plyometric sets) followed by the Diversity for some core centralized mat work.

The workouts are done in sets, and each move is repeated for 1 minute.  The moves target your whole body. Nothing gets a break! Dasha breaks down the moves so they are easy to pick up. There's also a bonus clip in each DVD that breaks down basic moves in further detail, helpful for all those who are new to training with kettlebells.

Even though I think the DVDs are stellar, I have two cons: One is the lack of motivating music the other is that Dasha is talking non stop throughout the sets which is NOT something she does in her live classes.  She gives great knowledge and pointers, but after a while you just want to tune out and let the music get you through the workout. To rectify this I have lowered the volume of the DVD and pumped up my own jams. Do that and the DVDs are perfection!

Buy a set today. You won't regret it!",1339372800,62,1961,4.321525885558583
5101674,5,B007OWPR6E,"I just started using the Kettlebell Kickboxing DVDs with Dasha two weeks ago and it honestly the best workout I have come across in a long time!  It is an intense 30 minute work out but it feels great to be done in just 30 minutes!  I have noticed such a difference already in how I feel and look.  Dasha is great in the video also, very encouraging and really breaks down each technique making it very easy to follow!

What is also so amazing about these workouts is you can never plateau!  You can always change your weight and speed of how you do the work out! I also hate going to the gym and startinga new class and never knowing the moves.  It is so nice to be in the comfort of your own home learning to do these work outs and succeeding!

If you want something that is going to make you sweat, feel toned and great this is exactly what you want!!

I love it!",1338422400,3,866,4.0828402366863905
5101675,5,B007OWPR6E,"This is the best workout I have ever done! Every time you do a workout the moves get easier and you can push yourself farther. I did a workout 3 times a week for about 3 weeks and I can already see a difference! My arms are more defined, I can run up stairs, hell, I can run! If you are thinking about getting this, just do it. It is totally worth the money! You will have fun and get fit!",1338249600,4,389,3.814814814814815
5101676,4,B007OWPR6E,"Kettlebell Kickboxing is an interval style workout using kettlebells, or a dumbbell. Most of the moves are pretty straightforward, and the addition of weight makes them more intense. Overall, I really like these workouts, they are shorter, the longest one is 45min with warmup/cooldown, but you work hard during this time. I don't have a dread factor with these, and they go by really quickly. I think Dasha does a good job sequencing the moves, so the higher impact moves are spread throughout the workout. Dasha also encourages you to work at your own pace, and provides lower and higher intensity modifiers in the workout. I will say if you are new to burpees/sprawls, you may want to look at something with less sprawl/burpees/planks, or plan on using a step or some kind of bench to put your hands on. I do wish she would have included a brief tutorial on some of the more unique moves, but I did get it down after doing it once.

Production- Production values are good, the set is bright without being too bright, picture is clear

Set/ outfits - Gym type set- Dasha and crew wear different style workout gear, mostly capri/ sports bra combos, nothing too crazy

Music- Supposedly there is music, however it is so quiet I can't hear it over Dasha, or my breathing:)

Instructor- This is what I took one star off for, Dasha is never quiet, she does have a lot of good form pointers, but she chats, a lot. I reallly wish there was a music only option for this, and I plan on muting her and playing my own music once I have done the workouts more. Overall, she is likable, and seems to know her stuff, it is more the ""stream of conciousness"" style of chatting that was annoying.",1337817600,37,1681,4.519736842105263

8519889,5,B007OWPR6E,"I love this because it's appropriate for people who are relatively out of shape to re-enter back into the world of metabolic workouts (the kind that use medium weight and repetitive movements so you feel out of breathe and the burn together...supposedly to jumpstart metabolism, etc.) but it would appropriate for advanced and middle of the road exercisers too since you can push as hard as you want, use whatever size kettle bell you want, slow or quicken pacing...it is very adaptable. It's also one of those workouts I do not seem to want to turn off halfway through, which for me a true testament to the quality of a workout video. I hope this helps! I definitely think it's a great video to pick up.",1502236800,3,704,4.595238095238095
8519890,5,B007OWPR6E,"Like others have said, she talks nonstop during the videos, however, I am good at tuning things out.  This is a great workout series combining kickboxing and kettlebells.  I really work up a sweat during her workouts and feel like I'm getting a great workout.  You will need a light kettlebell for this, it is not like regular kettlebell training where you are focused on increasing the weight, it is more like endurance.",1492992000,2,421,4.739726027397261

She is a little chatty but I am willing to over look that as I find the workouts to be sweating inducing and also fun. I gave this 1 star ONLY because the DVD package arrived damaged and for spending $45 that made me pretty grumpy. I won't be purchasing any more items from Home Fitness. Thankfully the DVDs work just fine. If you are looking for a fresh, heart thumping workout pick this one!",1474588800,,565,4.330188679245283

Plus, you get the benefit of seeing harder and easier variations of each exercise from four ladies working out around Dasha. Just as a side note, it appears they are using around 10 pound kettlebells. All I've got is a 20 pound k-bell, but I go at my pace and get a great workout.",1473638400,2,420,4.197530864197531
