8677825,5,B00NG39M5M,"This is a stupendous disc of Shostakovich offering revelatory compulsive and dramatic readings of both works

The disc opens with a reading of the Shostakovich Cello Concerto 1 that simply redefines the previous emotional and dramatic boundaries of the work. In short, and however implausibly, Isserlis arguably succeeds in making proverbial mincemeat of most previously familiar readings, and that even includes the dedicatee, Rostropovich.

This is essentially a reading of extremes, but all within the true context of the work. A volatile approach such as this requires considerable musical and technical virtuosity, not just from the soloist, but also from all members of the orchestra and, not least, from the conductor whose total empathy is essential. In this case absolutely all of these ingredients come together at once and the result is completely compelling and convincing. A completely engrossing and a redefining moment fortunately caught on camera and in sound.

The rest of the disc features two opus 1 works, the Sinfonietta by Britten and the Symphony 1 by Shostakovich.  Both of these works were written as graduation pieces by the two young composers, both aged 19 years at the time. The two works fared very differently initially and subsequently.

Britten was unable to secure a performance until a private one was given in the presence of an audience of critics. The one review, by William McNaught in the Musical Times, summarised the work as being by a composer who wanted to show `how knowing I am, how much wiser than my years.'  The Shostakovich symphony however, was given immediate and enthusiastic public recognition following on from a performance by the Leningrad P. O. under Nikolai Malko and that success has continued worldwide ever since.

On this disc, the Britten Sinfonietta is given a masterly performance by members of the orchestra without conductor.  This is of such quality that supporters of the work will be more than satisfied. However, there can be no doubt that posterity was correct in recognising the Shostakovich symphony as on a completely different level of inspiration, the only adverse early review comments being that the first two movements, by being relatively lightweight, may be out of balance with the apparently more seriously conceived remaining three movements.

On this disc that imbalance is addressed by Currentzis taking a far more incisive and dramatic approach to the first movements than usual, with biting detail and dynamics drawn out throughout the first movement and with a greater sense of desolation within the second movement. That approach, offering greater dramatic and emotional heft, is also applied to the remaining three movements and as a result a strikingly different, cohesive and alternative reading is produced. The solo timpani notes in the final movement, for example, would easily match the emotional bleakness of Mahler's hammer blows tears later in his sixth symphony.

The camera work is totally involving and the image resolution is excellent working within a suitably dark environment.  The sound is offered in stereo only which will be a minus point for collectors of modern recordings presented in the Blu-ray format. The lack of surround sound in a new recording is, inevitably, incomprehensible to collectors of modern recordings. Having said that, the stereo sound is superb - one of the best yet experienced and at no time was the lack of surround sound an obstacle to the enjoyment of what is an unusually outstanding disc judged by any criteria. There is an interesting booklet provided although references to Shostakovich's symphonies 9 and 14 as part of the program are confusing. Presumably this must refer to a general program of performances rather than to this specific one.

Those who pass this disc by because of the lack of surround sound will also pass by a remarkably enriching musical experience. The loss will be theirs and the gain will be for all of those collectors who value such a rarely caught musical sensation such as this and secure a copy for themselves.",1415059200,4,4084,5.161875945537065
