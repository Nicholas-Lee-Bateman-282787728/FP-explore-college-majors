183358,1,1562196650,"I was told this was the sequel to Ninja Scroll, IT IS NOT! What it is, in fact, is the single worst anime I have ever seen. Poor animation, lame  plot, weak characters and voice acting almost as bad as ""Battle  Angel."" It is absolutely unbearable. NOT RECCOMENDED!",966384000,2,264,4.479166666666667
183359,4,1562196650,"I would say that I really enjoyed this movie.  The plot was ok, and it was confusing some times but over all it seemed pretty fast paced, exciting, and had very good fight sceens and a pretty good collection of monsters.  I  must say that the voices did get a little anoying after a while.  But I  love ninja movies so I had to give it a good rating.  A word of advice  first, rent it before you buy it.",962841600,,403,3.9625

183361,1,1562196650,"Wraith of the Ninja has only one good quality going for it, it makes us appriciate Ninja Scroll even more. The characters in this over rought film are litteraly and metaphorically two dimesional. The animation is o.k., I  can say that I have definitly seen worse animation. The voices are down  right annoying. The story is absolutly rediculous. Take my advise pass on  this one and get ""Ninja Scroll"" instead. If already own  ""Ninja Scroll"" then try ""Street Fighter II:THE ANIMATED  MOVIE"". WARNING THIS FILM CONTAINS SCENES OF STRONG VIOLENCE. Sugested  viewing age is 15 and up. Yet nobody under seven would even find this waste  of animated cells entertaining.",961286400,2,664,4.9818181818181815
183362,5,1562196650,"This is truely great anime.  The animation, the dubbing, and the storyboard although confusing were all great.  There are so many monsters and other cool stuff.  YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!",955670400,,183,4.838709677419355
183363,2,1562196650,"When I saw the Yotoden series, subtitled, I was thrilled to find a Yotoden movie. Sadly, Wrath of the Ninja is only a rehash of the three volume series. This tape basicly takes the three earlier yotoden videos and cuts them into one. Now I am not saying that this type of idea is bad. Armatige  III Polymatrix does this very well. Unfortunetly to get the three tapes  into one numerous sceens are cut. Worse yet the deleted sceens are helpfull  in understanding the plot.  Oh but thats not all. The dubbing on this tape  is some of the worst I have ever heard. The original japanese voice talent  not only sounds better, but actualy seem like they have acting ability.  I  don't realy have anything good to say about Wrath of the Ninja. I only give  it 2 stars because it shares most of the Yotoden plot. My advise is to see  the three subtitled Yotoden tapes. They are excellent, and among my  personal favorites. If you have seen them don't even look at the Wrath box.  If you don't have the time to see the 3 tapes, then don't bother at all. I  would rather you not see Yotoden than see this.",953769600,11,1095,4.3088235294117645
183364,1,1562196650,"I must admit...I was duped. It's a popular anime title, and the animation on the box peaked my curiosity. Once I popped it in to watch, I was deeply dissapointed. Here's a list of why:

The animation is awful
The  plot is confusing
It's terribly boring
Overall, it's really  ""cheesey"" - they fight monsters out of the blue for no apparent  reason, the monsters just show up. I think this is a disgrace to japanese  animation. Want a reccomendation? Go with Akira or Ghost in the Shell.",953164800,2,485,4.528735632183908

183366,1,1562196650,"I'm sorry I even SAW the movie! The plot was horribly cheesy and the dialouge sounded like it came out of a low budget horror film. When I bought this, I thought it might be as good as other ninja animes, such as  Ninja Scroll, but I was terribly mistaken. For anyone that knows a good  movie if the saw one, please, don't buy this movie. You'd be better off  keeping your money.",951177600,,379,4.164383561643835
183367,5,1562196650,"This movie is one of the best I've seen in awhile,but I'm probably biased because I love the whole mystical,ancient type anime theme. The characters are great and develope well throughout the course of the movie(esp.  Raun-Maru! Who'd have thought it! COOOL though,he's my fav.),and the  animation is very good. The fighting scenes are good too. But there is one  thing I didn't like about it. It was that some scenes were toned so darkly  that it was like 'what in the heck just happened?'.But all-in-all Wrath of  the Ninja is worth every penny you spend on it!",951177600,,563,4.704081632653061
183368,4,1562196650,"I rented Wrath of the Ninja from Blockbuster video and found after watching it 2-3 times it became one of my favorites. Besides the demons, blood, gore, spiritual sword flying action it also has a great storyline,  romance and complicated characters. I admit at first i found it confusing  but the more i watched it the more i understood. It is a full length  feature film, not 50min like so many other animes'. The Demon God  storyline, the doublecross by Ranmaru, the Hosts' of Oboro, and the thought  provoking question of fate were all perfectly woven together to produce one  of the greatest anime films. I also found it a refreshing change that the  heroine Ionoskai [forgive my bad spelling] did not have the blond hair, big  breast, blue eyes look that is typical  of so many other japanimations. She  and the other female characters actually looked like real women and not  some artists fantasy, this made the movie so much more realistic and easy  to watch. I give this movie 4 stars and i highly recommed it.",947203200,,1019,4.662921348314606

183370,1,1562196650,"This may not be the worst anime i have ever seen but it sure comes close. A covuluted and unbelievable plot, another weak female character and a lousy ending combine to get this film a 1 star rating! Stick with Ninja  Scroll.",946771200,,225,4.357142857142857
183371,5,1562196650,"It is my favorite anime I have. It does have corny  music, but has a good storyline and action. You can tell it was edited, because new characters come out all the sudden. But other wise awwssomme.",946166400,,197,4.324324324324325
183372,4,1562196650,"When I first saw this movie in the video store I thought that the plot sounded interesting enough. And it was for about the fist half of the film. After a while the plot seemed to wane and became quite obscure as the movie  went on. I will admit that the transitions from scene to scene weren't the  clearest, but they weren't horrible. I have seen my share of bad anime  films, but this just doesn't fit in with any of them. I think that the  creators did a pretty descent job of putting this film together. But, I  must admit that I did lose interest from time to time. Perhaps if they  wouldn't have cut out anything from the series, I  probably would have  enjoyed the movie much more than I had. However many of its flaws, it still  was a pretty good movie. I would definately recomend that anyone interested  in this film to watch it and make your own decision.",945820800,,867,4.263803680981595

183374,2,1562196650,"At the start of this movie, it seemed rather interesting.  But the the movie rambled on from subject to subject, time period to time period, and the plot twist toward the end was so inaudible, that only a computer could  understand it completely.  I never know the intentions of any of the three  shadow warriors, and it is impossible to keep track of the seven obero  ninjas (unlike the 8 devils of Kimon in ""Ninja Scroll"") and the  love between Sakon and Ayama was not very beleivable.  This movie needed a  better introduction, and more time to straigten out the plot.  189 minutes  would be more suitable than a meager 89 minutes.  Throw in irritating  cheesy fight music, fights in which you don't know who is who, and plot  twists involving characters who were never really in the movie that much in  the first place, and you have one dissapointing movie that could have  ranked among great Ninja movies like ""Ninja Scroll,"" or ""The  Dagger of Kamui.""",943488000,2,957,4.640718562874252
183375,3,1562196650,"I have mixed feelings. It was hard to follow and will require multiple viewings. The female characters are particularly sympathetic. The narration to get around the action was distracting.

7796306,4,1562196650,"Originally written 6-18-10

In the year 1580 during Japan's Sengoku period, Lord Oda Nobunaga seeks to unify Japan with the aid of his warriors the Seven Oboro Ninja. His armies are destroying entire clans, but one of his goals is to wipe out the descendants of the Three Shadow Schools. One descendant, a female ninja named Ayanosuke barely escapes the total annihilation of her people and village. Before her escape, she is given a short sword with a legend. The legend states that the sword will eliminate evil and bring peace. During her travels, she encounters two other ninjas with weapons that carry the exact same legend.-summary

Age really hasn't effected Wrath of the Ninja in a negative way too much. For an anime feature made through 1987-1988, visually it's good and doesn't feel too dated. Some people like to point out the similarities to Ninja Scroll and there's a few, but Wrath of the Ninja quickly becomes its own entity, and the truth is that it does pre-date Ninja Scroll by 5 years anyway.

Where Ninja Scroll boasts fantastic visuals and over the top excessive violence, with intentions to cover its weak story and lack of character development. Wrath of the Ninja is more story driven but lacks the excessive violence. However, don't take this statement the wrong way because the OVA is no slouch in the violence department.

The OVA moves at a good pace with some good action scenes. The scenes could have been a lot better had some of them not been reused, which brings me to the animation. There's quite a bit of reused cels, stills during battle, and sword swipes simulating action. This type of combat has grown to annoy me over time, but I tend to give a small break to very early titles. In other cases, the action scenes can be pretty brutal with some vicious and disturbing killings. Some may have a problem with a few of the battles consisting of magic attacks that puts on a light show. I don't have much of a problem with it, but I would have preferred only weapon to weapon ninja combat.

The artwork is very good with some creative character designs, which have a small bit of variety. The backgrounds are pretty well detailed with pretty mountain designs. The soundtrack is very good at times with additional songs being added as the series continues, and most of them fit with the style and setting of the OVA. One song does come off very annoying to me, and just really didn't seem to fit with the action at all. Thankfully, this lousy instrumental is actually used sparingly. I also did enjoy the use of the sound effects in the very beginning, because it helped develop the first action scene. The OVA is only in Japanese, which is a plus because the English voice acting for the movie is terrible.

Character development has its moments here, and the main cast for the most part are well developed. The villains are interesting skill wise. However, their personalities are too much alike, and the lead villain didn't feel like too much of a threat to me. I also didn't like the use of any of the secondary characters. They weren't really developed and I didn't find much of a reason to care for these people. As a result, the overly dramatic death scenes for them had absolutely no effect on me. Although very straightforward, the story at times does feel hard to follow later on, due to many characters being introduced. If one isn't paying close attention to clans uniforms at the very least, then it's difficult to tell who's who.

I also liked the setting, which was combined with historical events, people, and the combination of fantasy and horror. There's a good deal of monsters and demons that are used in some freakish scenes. The fan service is kept relatively low, and there's no form of hentai to be found.

There are some good and unexpected plot twist. Plus, the ending was good with loose ends tied up. This is a very good title to pick up if you love older anime. Also, the two disk set is the one to get. It contains two versions of the same movie, but there is a world of difference. Yotoden: Chronicles of the Warlord Period is the OVA set, which is broken into three chapters with a 138 minute run time and is unedited. Wrath of the Ninja is the heavily edited and shorter version with an 87 minute run time. The story can still be understood but there are key points omitted.

There's also a good amount of extras consisting of historical & cultural notes, art gallery, and previews. The total run time for both film and OVA is 225 minutes.

Pros: Nice Japanese cast, good action, OVA is the best

Cons: Sometimes hard to follow, animation issues, secondary characters",1411689600,,4635,4.619684082624544
7796307,5,1562196650,"This was one of the first animes I ever owned growing up and when I wore out  the VHS copy I loved so much, i never thought I'd get to watch it again!

7796308,5,1562196650,"I recently purchased a bunch of miscellaneous anime, and had a viewing session over a few days.

Wrath of the Ninja actually was one of my more favored of the bunch. I watched the ""movie"" version. This is a relatively classic anime. The animation is good. I enjoyed the voice acting as much as most other decent shows/OVA's out there. I definitely preferred this over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Cadets/dp/B0000296QB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Cadets!</a>, and far and above&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harmagedon/dp/B00006HAYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harmagedon</a>.

I rather liked Spriggan, despite a less-than-perfect ending (I still thought the anime was better overall than Akira; by my preference anyway). I figure that, despite being of different genres Wrath of the Ninja was on par with Spriggan. I haven't watched the OVA feature included on the special edition yet, but I assume it will be of as high of quality if not higher quality than the ""movie"" version.

In all, I think this is worth a ""buy"" rating. Certain more so than Harmagedon or Ninja Cadets mentioned above.",1177545600,,1384,6.942528735632184
7796309,4,1562196650,"this was a good buy. the movie of coarse was good, but i liked the mini series a little better. it goes a little more indepth to the story and explains a few things that were skipped. but hold a finger on the pause button, the subtittles run a bit fast and its hard to read it all in time. but well worth it.",1174867200,,308,3.828125

A young ninja escapes her village's destruction armed with a mystical dagger, one of the three legendary weapons that can end the warlords rule. To do this she must join her fellow fugitives, bearers of the remaining blades, warriors who are destined to free Japan ... or die.

This is a two disc set with both the movie and the series I love it. I love ""Wrath of the Ninja"" every since it first advertise on television back in the 90's.",1155254400,3,564,4.529411764705882
7796311,5,1562196650,"For the first time ever on dvd we get the complete version of 'Yotoden: Chronicle of the Warlord Period' which originally only made it on to VHS.

Orginally made in 1987, Yotoden boasts a strong budget of detailed and fluid animation with a complex and thought provoking story but it doesn't lack action either. It's set in 1580 and embarks on a very accurate historical timeline.

I must say i really love the character designs and diverse colour palletes used. There is some absolutly stunning scenes which just sparkle on screen visually. I literally freeze frame on some occasions to take in all the detail in the forest scenery. It really does make me miss the era of cel animation.

Alot of fans may be familiar of this title through the name 'Wrath of the Ninja' which is the 90 minute theoretical version of Yotoden which was originally released on dvd in 1999. Unfortunately this had 45 minutes of plot cut out of it.

Why Central Park Media in 1999 originally chose to release the edited version over the uncut version is beyond me. But all is forgiven and forgotten now we have all 3 episodes which amount to the complete 135 minutes.

Those videophiles will be pleased to know CPM have given fans a brand new and digitally remastered transfer which is crystal clear with no visible signs of artefacts or grain. I only wish CPM had put this much effort into their other releases.

CONCLUSION - Fans owe it to themselves to see the original Yotoden in all it's unedited glory. This title certainly has impressive writing. Infact i was so suprised by the quality of the story that i didn't realise that i could enjoy and be so engaged in a story revolving around a group of Ninjas.",1153785600,15,1690,4.598006644518272
