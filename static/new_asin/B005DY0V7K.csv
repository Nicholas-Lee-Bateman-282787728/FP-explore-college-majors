4663152,5,B005DY0V7K,"We purchased this series from a vendor other than Amazon, because they had a B.O.G.O sale. My wife and I have become addicted to BBC Mystery.  'Inspector Morse', 'Inspector Lewis', and 'Touch of Frost' have topped our list. We also enjoyed the Kenneth Branaugh Wallander series, and elected to try the original Swedish version with Krister Henriksson. What a delight!!! We now count this as our favorite. We also note that Henriksson was hand picked by author Mankell to play the role of the taciturn, enigmatic eponymous detective. After watching all 13 episodes in an extraordinarily short time-frame, we thoroughly grasp Mankell's enthusiasm for this gifted Swedish actor.  We can only hope for more!!!",1344124800,39,705,5.175438596491228
4663153,5,B005DY0V7K,"This second series of 13 90-minute episodes is more slickly produced than the first series. The stories are solid and well-written. All episodes are again based on story outlines written for TV by Henning Mankell, and I have found each to be thoroughly engrossing. In addition, series 2 maintains the high level of acting from a group of very talented Swedish performers.  Even though two of the main characters from series 1 are gone, Krister Henricksson remains fantastic as Kurt Wallander, and, IMHO, gives the best portrayal of the character. The subtitles can be a bit clunky at times even if one is very familiar with British English. A minor annoyance is that the subtitles do not denote when the characters are speaking a language other than Swedish, such as Russian or Polish, and sometimes that distinction is important to the plot.
I eagerly await series 3 in 2013.",1343606400,70,876,4.879194630872483
4663154,5,B005DY0V7K,"While the absence of Linda and Stephan is felt, the plots and subplots are great and the acting is supurb, expecially Krister Hendrickson as Wallander. it's also worth watching for the scenery around Ystad.",1343001600,7,206,5.088235294117647
4663155,5,B005DY0V7K,"In response to T.W. Yates review, the complete first season of Henning Mankell's Wallander is available from Mhz Networks; for some reason Amazon is only selling the first season in three DVD segments, rather than complete.

The Music Box collection of the second season is exceptional, as well as only enhanced by the addition of Lena Endre to the cast.  The only caveat comes with the direction and over-use of soft, light-diffused cinematography in the episode titled Arvet (The Heritage), which is sadly intrusive.

While I have enjoyed both Rolf Lassgrd and Kenneth Branaghs'interpretations of Kurt Wallander, Krister Henriksson's characterization here remains, for me, the definitive portrayal of Mankell's world-weary detective, and the 26 episode Swedish television series the best of Wallander's appearances in film.  If you are a fan of Mankell's detective in print, or Scandinavian crime dramas in general, this is not to be missed!",1339632000,200,943,5.394557823129252

Don't get me wrong, in this version, he is still a messed up detective, to be sure. But somehow he's more human in this version -- maybe more intermittently clueless before he gets it -- but he DOES get it. I love the actress who played his daughter in the first two seasons -- it's sad she's gone. This Wallander has more interesting, complex relationships that sustain, and I don't miss the father issue of the British version, or the sexism of the original (first) version. In this one, you also get a much better sense of the small town, and of Malmo. It's not as gorgeously filmed as the British version, but it's very solid, interesting cinematography that captures the weather, the place, the people.

Last season had an episode about illegal guns and a teenage assassin that was shot mostly handheld but it was probably the best of the series.  Dynamic pacing and thoughtful direction was obvious.

The second season moves like a snail and you lose interest if you don't have a lot of patience. Season 1 is the best and Season 2 is average at best.

4663209,5,B005DY0V7K,"I grew up watching Columbo, and ended up becoming a fan of the Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis series.  Wallander is probably among the most realistic and cerebral of this genre.  Definitely better than the British version featuring Kenneth Branagh, which was at time overly dramatic.  This version, produced by the author of the Wallander series of books, Henning Mankell, seems to possess a more genuinely ""Swedish"" tone.  Krister Henriksson's acting is a key part of this realism, in my opinion.

This set of DVDs, from the second season, was well worth the cost, and now one of the most valuable parts of my DVD collection.",1391644800,,631,4.915094339622642

4663225,5,B005DY0V7K,"Just to be clear, this is a boxed set of Wallander Season 2. Other actors have played this famous Swedish detective but consensus in that Henriksson does it best and i completely agree!  This is a very nice boxed set that gets you all the S2 90-minute movies, most of which were aired on SE TV.  At the current price of $40, that's only about $3 per movie, which is a great deal considering the quality of this great series.  This is somewhat similar to Season 1 (filmed about 3 years prior), but you will notice a few differences. On the upside, the production values are better than S1. The other main difference is that most of the characters are different. Aside from Wallander, maybe 2-3 others come back from S1 but there is no Linda Wallander in S2. That being said, the new characters are actually very intriguing, especially the 2 rookies. The music also changed but doesnt have a major impact either way imo.  If I had to chose, I would say i preferred S1 but only slightly over S2 and both would be a welcomed addition to any fan of good, solid international crime mysteries!",1376092800,5,1086,4.46969696969697
4663226,1,B005DY0V7K,I am not familiar with the book however I could not tolerate this show.  I only watched all three episodes because I thought I would start to enjoy them.  Wallender's character is the most annoyingly depressed person in the world!  He is in so much pain that he walks around like a zombie.  I don't find this entertaining.,1375142400,,322,4.5
4663227,5,B005DY0V7K,Well worth the money.  Several episodes of the Swedish production with English subtitles with outstanding actors.  A very satisfying complement to the BBC version.,1374624000,2,163,5.75
4663228,5,B005DY0V7K,"This series is stellar in its delivery, richly shot, and Krister Henriksson is fantastic in the lead role.  Comments here about the series being available on NetFlix or Itunes are valid; you can see this cheaper.  But however you see it, see it.  It is not often i see i drama so well crafted that i am thinking about an episode 2 or 3 days later.  With respect to the first season, i think Season 2 is better in terms of pacing and storyline (i suspect that is because Season 2 is not beholden to written novels).  i cannot compare it to the Branaugh version, because i haven't seen that yet, but i seriously doubt Braunaugh could match Krister Henriksson in this role.  i only wish Henriksson would make more.

Update:  August 6, 2013
I have now watched all of the Branagh Wallanders on Netflix.  They are certainly worth watching, and it is nice that there is no real overlap between the Branagh and Henriksson series (in the sense that the Branagh series is based on earlier Mankell stories, and is in this sense, a prequel).  But i still think Henriksson's portrayal of Wallander is better, and urge anyone who enjoys the Branagh version to give Henriksson a try.

Henriksson is steely-eyed and stony-faced; understated; and as genuine as the Gracean formula in his hair and the Every-Who-in-Whoville-ness of his beer gut.  Branagh, in contrast, looks like he just left the set of the View (where he was part of an intervention) and took Hollywood lessons on how to brandish a gun.  Henriksson wears a cheap suit and tie (in which he appears demonstrably uncomfortable); Branagh wears a laid back army jacket, and the fashion-appropriate amount of razor stubble.  It is obvious, when watching Henriksson's Wallander, why his daughter is mad at him (because he is, after all, a callous prick, who has always put his job before his family); but it never seems justifed when her counterpart is upset with Branagh's Wallander.  Branagh is, in short, too warm and fuzzy. Henriksson is spot on.

all that said, it could be that things just seem smarter when you are reading subtitles.",1368489600,6,2083,4.728531855955679
4663229,3,B005DY0V7K,"These episodes were a great disappointment for me. Right from the start Wallander was smoking and drinking, two things he was not to do for health reasons. He was protrayed as not being in control of his group. The two new cadets, Pontus and Isabelle, showed no interest in learning from Wallander and even ignored most of the rules with no actions taken against them. Martinson came across as a jerk out for Wallander's job. It was stupid that he watched a pedifile's house for many nights and while he watches it , it is spray painted and yet he stops watching so they come back and throw rocks and the mother is killed, with no follow up on catchng the culprits even though  he had a good idea who they were. Swvartman came across as a totally stupid cop who has more interest in his mobile phone than his job, and with no actions taken against him. He was always one who very quietly followed something until he solved it. he couldn't even guard a hospital room without playing games and would never have allowed his kids to run all over a crime scene. Katerina made Wallander look foolish and useful only as a babysitter.",1368057600,,1126,4.466019417475728

4663231,5,B005DY0V7K,"Season 2: would love to find that a 3rd season had been, or was being released. In spite of the language being Swedish with English subtitles, the stories flow and the subtitling is not a problem. Excellent!!!",1367452800,2,209,4.675675675675675
4663232,5,B005DY0V7K,"Very well written stories; very well acted. I have read comments that season 2 is more slickly produced than season 1, but I don't notice that difference.  (I probably would never have sought out this 2nd Swedish production if it wasn't for the recent British production, which clearly pales in comparison, IMHO.)

Some of the episodes are much better developed than others and some are much too intense for me (e.g., coincidentally, episode 4 in each of the 2 seasons). But these programs are so well produced and balanced between visual images and dialog, I completely forget I am reading subtitles.

The European and British police procedurals tend to be 60- or 90-minute episodes rather than the, at best, 45-minute US episodes, so they have a very clear advantage from the get-go.  AND they clearly demonstrate they know how to use that advantage (plus they rarely chop them up to fit the action between commercial breaks!).  All-in-all, this advantage makes for a much more interesting and satisfying viewing experience, even when viewing the US programs on DVD/downloads; they chopped up story lines & action are VERY distracting.",1365897600,2,1137,5.0588235294117645

4663234,5,B005DY0V7K,"While the first twelve installments co-starring Johanna Sallstrom and Ola Rapace were superior in complexity and characterization, the thirteen stories in this set are extremely well-crafted and deserve a place in every mystery lover's video library.  Though Krister Henriksson and Rolf Lassgard are both excellent in their portayals of Kurt Wallander, I always visualize Henriksson when I read the novels.  Kenneth Branagh, a first rate actor and director, is definitely not my vision of Wallander.  My only quibble with this particular box set is the avante garde packaging of the discs.  I scratched a couple of the dvds in extracting them before I learned the proper procedure.  Perhaps it's due to my ineptitude, but a simpler system like Arrow, a British video firm, with each disc on its hinged plastic page would be far better.  It's a minor complaint and not worthy of any deduction in stars.  Wallander is always entertaining, whether on paper or video.",1364256000,,963,5.134615384615385

4663241,1,B005DY0V7K,"The Swedish series ""Wallander"" is probably the best police drama ever filmed for its comprehensive attention to quality in every aspect of film making. Anyone that has seen it rates if 5 stars and with good reason. Unfortunately, Netlix has this season 2 (not noted in the product description) in its entirety as part of its membership archive (for $8). Equally unfortunately Amazon has Season 1 in it's entirety BUT which they have decided to hack into four pieces and charge $30 for each piece of 3 episodes each or $120 for the 13 episodes. Or you can rent each episode for $5 ($75 for the privilege). To date this is the most egregious exploitation of its customers Amazon has engaged in. Not many are going to rent this for $5 let alone pay $120 for the series. Nor are they going to pay $80 for a Netflix-like subscription to watch Amazon films many of which are available with Netflix and those that are not only $2.99 - a fair rental price. Nor are they going to refer anyone to this service. If Amazon wanted to promote its rental streams they would not gouge the price of their best material in rentals or sales. As a store manager one told us (as we negotiated to buy a few dozen surplus glasses he had) ""Better in your house than in my store"" and gave us a price that was much less than we expected. We have been back there a dozen times and referred at least six dozen foreigner visitors to that store. Eventually this will be available elsewhere and we will simply wait for it (there are other excellent Danish and Swedish and French police drama series out there right now).

4663246,5,B005DY0V7K,"I have a fondness for mysteries in book form, particularly well-done series, and in recent years have enjoyed several of the older cinema mystery series classics, like Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto series from the '30's, or the competing Charlie Chan series -- period pieces, both, but good-to-great fun, and in part fascinating simply as glimpses of their era.

I read Mankell's Wallander series a few years ago, and became curious about this set of films after watching a recent German mystery film on Dutch TV (while traveling) that seemed quite well-done -- and different from American film/TV.  Of course, as any Wallander fan reading this has no doubt figured out by now, there is the Kenneth Branaugh Wallander series, and there is this series, in which Wallander is portrayed by Krister Henricksson.  I like Branaugh well enough, but various sources seemed to be of the view that Henricksson is ""the"" Wallander, so I decided to try the Henricksson series out first, beginning with this box.  (As others have noted as well in their reviews, this box also consists of the 2nd series of Wallander movies made by Henricksson, not the first, but no matter; this turned out to be a great place to start, and some say it is a bit better than the first series.)

If you get this series (and I could not recommend it more highly, whether you've read the Wallander books or not), here are some things worth knowing:  Although these films -- each 90 minutes, by the way -- are not based upon any of the Wallander books, Mankell had a hand in the writing...my impression is that he was at least involved with the creation of the plots.  Also, Wallander, as played in this series, is somewhat less hard-edged, impulsive, anti-social and difficult than as pictured in the books -- and this was with Mankell's approval.  In the documentary Lone Wolves & Dragon Tattoos (which is about Scandanavian crime fiction and is available from Amazon and highly recommended by this reviewer) both Mankell and Henrickson are interviewed about the making of this series.  It is clear that they have tremendous respect for each other, and when it is described how, over the course of the making of the two Wallander series, Henricksson ""became"" Wallander, it rings true...especially when one sees the films.

There are 13 films in this series, directed by 7 different directors, with scripts by a variety of writers.  The first film, The Revenge, was the only one released to the cinema (according to Wikipedia).  It is the only film in the series directed by Charlotte Brandstrom, and struck me as -- perhaps unfortunately for the series and certainly inauspicious -- the weakest of the bunch.  The remaining films -- 2 for each director -- are surprisingly consistent in style (with some variation, especially the 2 by Mikael Marcemain, who seems a bit overly fond of hand-held camera work and sudden scene shifts for this viewer's taste).  The atmosphere is ""real-world,"" sometimes gritty, sometimes violent, but also with much of the steady marching forward of police work, yet well-paced so that the tension moves us forward to climactic and generally satisfying conclusions.  As one might expect from this many films done in a relatively short time (I think about a year), there are some plot weaknesses here and there, but the pacing is such that it is quite easy to suspend disbelief (as with any good story-telling).  And -- what probably draws many of us closest to series characters -- there is development of the characters over the course of the series.  (Which means they are best seen in order.)  Again, no doubt as a result of the circumstances of their creation, the character development is not always completely consistent, and not every thread is followed through, but as a package, it works, and works well.  The characters resonate as real people.  The subject matter of the plots -- as is Mankell's style -- resonate with various important issues of the times: immigrant workers, the drug trade, gangs, predatory medical fraud, etc.  And the acting throughout is first rate -- especially that of Henricksson.  Henricksson can express a good deal without ever saying a word.  But, really, the whole cast is superb.

Highly, highly recommended.  We'll be moving onto the first series next.  (What was it I said about watching these in order??  Oops...but my partner Dorothy came in after the 3rd film and couldn't resist finishing out the series without even going back to catch up on the first 3.  We'll do that after we see the first series...and then maybe the Branaugh versions.  But by then, there is talk of a 6-film 3rd series with Henricksson coming out, which is said to be the last of the bunch...but we'll see.)",1353888000,9,4716,4.86
4663247,5,B005DY0V7K,"Loved the books, loved the PBS Kenneth Branagh version and then discovered the Swedish TV series.  I felt the Branagh series was how non-Scandanavians picture Sweden although the last 3 produced are grittier and more like the TV Series.  The Swedish version is superior in reproducing Mankell's vision.",1353801600,2,302,5.270833333333333
4663248,5,B005DY0V7K,"The following refers to the 13 episodes of Season 2.

It sometimes seems as though the world is divided into two groups: those for whom subtitles pose no problem, and those for whom they do. If you fall in the former group, and you enjoy police-procedural dramas, then this series is for you. If you fall in the latter group, or if your comfort level plummets when you venture beyond BBC productions, then try the series with Kenneth Branagh and a supporting cast of English-speaking actors pretending to be Swedes - it's not as good, but it is in English.

I am a big fan of British police-procedural/detective series, and it was only because I was having trouble finding ones I had not seen that I turned to the Swedish-language ""Wallander"" series with Krister Henriksson in the lead role. I was impressed: it holds its own against the better British series.

Which actor you consider the definitive Kurt Wallander may depend on which version of the series you see first (assuming you see more than one). As much as I like Branagh and admire his work, he runs second to Henriksson in the Wallander Stakes. Indeed, the character of Wallander is not the same in the two series. The focus is much more on Wallander in the British series - a choice perhaps necessary to attract Branagh to the role - and he is portrayed as something of a loner, while in the Swedish version the members of Wallander's squad get significant screen time, and Wallander is portrayed more as an intelligent man with good instincts who is effective as a detective, a leader and a mentor. Branagh's Wallander is a man grappling with emotional issues, while Henriksson's comes across as reflective and world-weary but a man largely at peace with himself. I have not read the books on which the series is based, so I do not know which portrayal is truer to Mankell's character, but I do know I'd rather spend time with Henriksson's Wallander than with Branagh's.

The supporting cast is excellent, and, as indicated above, we are allowed to get to know their characters. The plots of the episodes held my attention, production values are high, and the locations and Swedish-speaking cast added to the verisimilitude. I especially liked how the relationship between Wallander and the prosecutor (an attractive divorce who is also his neighbor) was handled. They are two adults of middle-age who develop feelings of mutual respect and affection (though they occasionally butt heads on the job), but their attraction is tempered by the baggage each carries from previous relationships. Their mating dance is cautious and restrained -very Scandinavian, one could say - and strikes just the right notes.

I rarely sit through the end credits, but the song ""Quiet Night,"" written and performed (in English) by Swedish singer/song-writer Anna Ternheim, which serves as the end theme for many of the episodes and which so effectively captures the mood of the central character and the Scandinavian settings, kept me in my seat as long as they rolled. This song is available from Amazon UK as an mp3 download or as part of a compilation of music from the series. But if you live in the US, it appears that you'll have to listen to it on YouTube.

[To fans of the detective/police-procedural genre who are not subtitle-averse, I highly recommend the Swedish series ""Beck"" and ""Van Veeteren"" and the French series ""Spiral"" (originally ""Engrenages"").]",1353542400,35,3412,4.874137931034483
4663249,5,B005DY0V7K,"I've been watching this and really like it....even better than the BBC version with Kenneth Branagh, who I can't quite buy as Kurt Wallander. This is a Swedish tv production with subtitles but it seems more authentic to Mankell's novels to hear the actors speak Swedish, to see Swedish architecture in the background, to see the reserve of the characters' behaviors. The episodes are a meaty 1.5 hours, so you really get the complexity of story lines and the detailed steps undertaken in solving the crimes. The Wallander character in the tv show seems more 3-dimensional than the novel...he has a party at his house, he owns a dog named Jussi, he develops relationships with his co-workers. The character in the novel is more of a workaholic who lives an unhealthy lifestyle and has diabetes...and in the final book, (SPOILER ALERT) ends up with Alzheimers. I'm going to get the earlier season (2005) and hope they're as good as this 2009 season. I'm transfixed.

I  like the  characterization of a detective (in both versions)  who is passionate about his job that he  sacrifices  his family life  & his wife & daughter have difficulty coping with him.

It has complicated plots (good for the mind) but promotes a recognition of our weaknesses. It has made me reflect quite often.

Good plots , excellent dialogues , perfect timing, nice sceneries & soothing background music .

Was first exposed to the Swedish version ( with  Krister Henriksson) before trying out the English version . Both are good with slightly different slants - I find the English version more intense while I find Krister Henriksson equally passionate but a much cooler guy.

I am saddened that the English version has ended with Season 4 but glad there are more episodes to watch in the Swedish version after Season 1. I look forward to watching the next series from Season 2 onward.",1524700800,,987,4.815476190476191
