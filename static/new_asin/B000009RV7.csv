1198270,1,B000009RV7,"There is nothing about IF YOU ONLY KNEW which makes it worth watching, much less purchasing.  I mean, NOTHING.
The very best that can be said about the acting in the film is that it's mostly inoffensive.  There's no chemistry between Alison Eastwood and Jonathan Schaech, who spends 90 minutes disproving the audience's THAT THING YOU DO!-inspired belief that he could act.  His reading of the final scene is especially unbearable.  Eastwood is, if possible, worse.  She has no ability whatever to make an emotional connection with the audience.
Of course, it may not all be their fault.  The screenplay is utterly inane.  It's so obviously formulaic, it might as well have been written entirely using a computer screenplay program.  The only way we were able to make it through the film was to jokingly guess what the next scene would bring--and we were right every time.
The direction hardly lifts the film out of it's doldrums.  It, too, is predictable, down to camera angle and blocking.  You could call the last scene with more than an hour left in the film.  Worse than the complete lack of technical innovation, the director is unable to pull any performances from his actors.  Not only does he allow his stars to languish, he seems unconcerned that most of his supporting cast are giving garishly over-the-top readings.
As for the overall essence of IF YOU ONLY KNEW, well, it's derivative of THREE TO TANGO which in turn is essentially a TOOTSIE remake.  It does it with nothing of the style of those other films, though.  If you want ""mistaken identity"", go for TOOTSIE.  If you want ""mistaken gay identity"", THREE TO TANGO is clearly the superior.  But if you just want to wonder why you mistakenly spent your money, this is your gig.

1198297,3,B000009RV7,"Every so often I find a movie that absolutely holds my interest, even though it isn't a 5 star movie with lots of hype. This was one of those appealing movies. As for Allison Eastwood, I didn't realize who her father was. I thought she was quite good, and the love interest who pretended to be gay was darling. I laughed out loud several times. Only seeing the twin towers in the background of this New York-based movie was tugging on my heartstrings.",1016236800,2,451,4.445783132530121

1198300,4,B000009RV7,"I finished ""If you only Knew"" with a smile on my face. Unlike the big bugdet, fomula commercial films out today, this film actually had heart, combined with a story that anyone who's ever cared about someone can relate to. Allison Eastwood, like her Pops, has real acting chops. The additional cast was right on target, bringing the film to a level you seldom see in an independent film. David Snedeker's direction rocked. His vision captured the essence of the story without being intrusive, cleverly using the camera as the tool of observation. Highly recommended, spend the three bucks.",976060800,2,589,4.959595959595959

7905733,2,B000009RV7,"I bought this movie because I remember seeing a bit of it many years ago and thought that the storyline was interesting (a straight woman falling for her ""gay"" friend). Well now that I have watched the dvd, I don't think I'll be watching it again. The acting is bad, the hero works for a fake psychic hotline and I just didn't feel the connection between the hero and heroine.

7905737,5,B000009RV7,"Generally, I hate romantic comedies and avoid them like the plague but I came looking for another Paul Sampson flick (he also stars in Night of the Templar). Even though the story is completely predictable, the chemistry between all the characters is refreshing. This indie film is refreshing because it's not overly dramatic, no over attempts at being funny - it's all very natural and flows very nicely. Miquel Nunez and Paul Sampson are hilarious and they should've spun off on their own sit com after this flick! Definitely good for date night. No sex, no violence, no nudity but kids would be bored. lol",1402531200,,608,4.8
7905738,3,B000009RV7,"I enjoyed it, but sometimes it moved slowly. It was fairly predictable of course. If you like romantic stories, you'll probably like it.",1399593600,,136,4.956521739130435
7905739,3,B000009RV7,"Admittedly the lead character has a run of bad luck: he's working for a ""fake"" psychic 900 line (and a friend of mine is working for one of these, so I know they're not routinely fake) after getting fired from his journalist job, and then his apartment goes up in smoke after he falls asleep with a candle burning.  He sees a woman in a shop he is immediately attracted to, but she turns out to be his prospective roommate, and the reason why he's a prospect is because he's been mistaken for being gay.  (All that sensitivity and a certain naivete on his part has led to the necessary misconception to get the plot going.)  So ""meet cute"" doesn't automatically correspond to cute couple, as he wants to live in the apartment and be close to her, so that necessitates his pretending to be gay, rather than risk getting tossed out.  Alison Eastwood and Jonathon Schaech are the leads, and there are problems right there, with the casting.  Alison Eastwood has one quality right that serves the production; there is a common earthiness to her, she could easily be mistaken for ""white trash,"" and this coarseness works for the part.  You can imagine how a straight guy would automatically make her his object of desire, unlike a cold and blandly wholesome type blonde like Kate Hudson, who could have been considered for this same role.  Hudson is better at keeping a man at bay rather than drawing him in thru a combination vulnerability and earthiness as Eastwood embodies.  What is wrong, however, with Eastwood's casting is she is an extremely limited one-note actress, with a nasal voice.  Without finesse in comedy her dialogue scenes fall flat, especially since her voice itself is flat and nonexpressive; she is far better as a physically expressive actress, especially in scenes in which she is attired the way Marilyn Monroe would have been.  In fact, in another time, this would have been a perfect Monroe feature, and she would have been able to handle the comedy.  Much more experienced co-star Schaech is quite good here, but there is a loophole in the screenplay that has the physically gorgeous actor strangely lame when it comes to women (the guy can't seem to get a date), though gay men find him attractive (maybe because the occupancy of the pool is slimmer pickings?).  But even Schaech has no real funny moments, which means the direction is at fault, as a comedy requires a certain lightness which is missing here.  He's also as an actor very talented, and certainly leading man attractive, but lacks the star quality of a big name movie star (Cruise, Roberts), which is why as a film actor he still falls below the radar (a fate shared until recently with actors'-actor Christian Bale ""Batman"").  Sometimes only a star's charisma can save a production.  The only true hilarity in the film comes from the invented character of ""Boris"" (and it's over-the-top, neatly out of place in this film), a friend of the lead pretending to be a gay boyfriend so girl roommate will stop setting up pretend gay guy on gay dates.  But not everything else is bad: there is some sweet bonding going on between the leads, their friendship, based upon a misconception (his being gay) which allows them to have a freedom to explore each other as people rather than potential romantic contrast.  As well, he is able to feel relaxed around women in a way he's never been before: the conflict isn't there, as there is in normal straight woman-straight man sexual awareness.  And the straight man pretending to be gay is interacting with more gay men, which also allows his own self-awareness and self-confidence to strengthen.  The soundtrack is forgettable, except for a bar scene where the lead singer is impressive.  But the screenplay doesn't know whether it wants to be a gentle comedic exploration of male-female bonding or should be more traditional comedy of errors, which involves more loud, outrageous happenings.  So I'd recommend a rental on the film, rather than an outright purchase, unless you're a fan of either Eastwood or Schaech and require the personal copy to sit on your shelf.  It will get watched, it's not a bad film, but it's not as good as it could have been: the screenplay was trying to do too many things and the direction was heavy-handed, and the film required a Monroe, and there doesn't seem to be one out there.  (And I'm not a Monroe fan, so that says a lot from me.)",1142985600,8,4401,4.724183006535948
7905740,5,B000009RV7,"This was a cute movie. If you're looking for something deep and meaningful, this is not it. If you're looking for something lighthearted and entertaining, then it's definitely worth watching. I have several gay friends, so certainly enjoyed the humor in the movie. I've even had a crush on a gay friend and would have loved to have him tell me he wasn't really gay! In a way, this was kinda like watching my own fantasy play out! This was such an enjoyable movie that I'm definitely adding it to my collection.",1091491200,2,510,4.554347826086956
