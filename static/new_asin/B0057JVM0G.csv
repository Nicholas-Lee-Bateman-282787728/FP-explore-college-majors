8460824,5,B0057JVM0G,"This is a great dvd! Who can argue with the main event of Sugar Ray Leonard vs Thomas ""The Motorcity Cobra"" Hearns! This main event features two of the greatest fighters of all time and the drama that unfolds is what any sporting event aspires to be. it is very interesting how these fighters both changed there game plans during this fight with Hearns starting out as the puncher and Leonard starting out as the boxer and midway through the fight Hearns started boxing and Leonard started slugging for the K.O.. What a great fight! Plus you get to see other boxing greats like Manny Pacquiao,Sugar Shane Mosley,Jorge Paez,Genero Hernandez, and Ricardo Lopez. Ricardo Lopez should be Ranked very high among Boxing historians but the under exposure of his strawweight division leaves him mostly forgotten. In this dvd you get to see a true master of boxing in Lopez who retired undefeated in 52 fights. This dvd is a great addition to any fight collection.",1342310400,2,955,4.793939393939394

- Manny Pacquiao vs. ""Sugar"" Shane Mosley (May 7, 2011)

This may have been the most heinous fight in Manny Pacquiao's career, even more reprehensible than the Agapito Sanchez bout in 2001. Because this one, we thought, had such potential. But, really, the writing was on the wall. We should've bought a clue when Sugar Shane Mosley performed so dismally against Sergio Mora, a boxer who hits with the full might of a three-year-old. I blame HBO's 24/7 which, okay, suckered me too into believing that, hey now, Shane might actually have a shot against the world's best pound for pound. But nuh-uh.

This was probably the most boring scrap I've ever seen Pacquaio in, and maybe the only fight of his in which boos rained down vigorously from the crowd. Manny tried his best, but whether it was his reported leg cramps or Shane's height or long reach or constant safety-first demeanor, this fight was a chore to watch. It takes two to tango, and after two rounds of feeling out, Mosley had managed to introduce his jabs and right hands. But all that noise stopped in the third round once Pacman's quick left hand crumbled Shane to the canvas. And it didn't help that Shane and Pacman were engaging in frequent respectful love taps.

Things finally heated up in the tenth round, the scene of a disputed knockdown but actually a push from Mosley that deposited Pacquiao onto the floor. An enraged Pacman made a concerted effort to turn it on, and when the bell had rung, you can see a fatigued Mosley stagger to his corner. Honestly, If you want to see a video which excitingly encapsulates the fight, go to YouTube and type in ""FIGHT CAMP 360: Pacquiao vs. Mosley - Full Episode 5 -SHOWTIME Boxing."" After the tenth round, you can hear Shane asking his corner to stop the fight... because of a blister on his foot (but probably because he was concerned about the hellstorm Pacquaio was about to bring in the coming round). You can also check out Shane's hot model girlfriend dis her man. At one point, she screams at Mosley: ""He's making you his f------ bit<h!""

- Ricardo ""Finito"" Lopez vs. Alex ""Nene"" Sanchez (August 23, 1997)

Even when Ricardo Lopez naps, his hands are up. It's how well-trained he is. I don't know that we should even talk spit about his opponent, Alex Sanchez, whose role in this play is one of ambulatory punching bag. It's a shame that the minimum weight division doesn't get more love, that more people don't talk up Finito Lopez, undefeated champion, a master ring technician, a true craftsman. And whenever I think of him, I think of that classic hands up stance of his. Anyway, he made quick work of Sanchez, dropping him in the second and the fifth, with Sanchez resorting to dirty pool in the fourth round. In the fifth round a monster Lopez left hook propelled Sanchez to the floor again, and the ref mercifully waived it off. Just another tutorial on the Sweet Science conducted by one of the most accomplished and disciplined pugilists in the history of the sport.

- Genaro ""Chicanito"" Hernandez vs. Jorge ""Maromero"" Paez (March 31, 1995)

Rest in peace, champion. Classy in and out of the ring, Hernandez was unbeaten at this stage when he took on Maromero Paez, he of the ugly mohawk 'do. And it's pretty easy to break down this fight. Even though Paez was as game as they come, Hernandez was taller and rangier and more polished. There were some decent engages in this one, but a bad cut would do Maromero in, to the tune of an eight round TKO. But why did Paez have ""Tyson"" shaved into his head?

- ""Sugar"" Ray Leonard vs. Tommy ""the Hitman"" Hearns (September 16, 1981)

This one is the highlight of the DVD, and it's not even close. The 1980s was sheer heaven for boxing fans, an era in which the best fighters fought each other. Hagler. Hearns. Leonard. Duran. And, sure enough, the first Leonard/Hearns bout was a classic, a corker, a doozy. The ebbs and flows and role reversals of the fight had you reeling. This one took place back when a boxing match went fifteen rounds.

The first few rounds unfolded as expected, Sugar Ray as the dancing master and a showboater so eyecatching that Maromero Paez probably took frenzied notes, and Tommy Hearns stalking, mocking and big grinning. On this night, Leonard's slickness wasn't working out. Hearns' snapping jabs seemed to throw Leonard off and then the Motor City Cobra was also blasting him with his battering right hands. Leonard's left eye was soon puffy, and then swoll.

And then the game changer. Near the end of round six Leonard's hybrid uppercut-left hook shook up Hearns' world, and did you notice that grin promptly vanishing? In round 7 Leonard really sat down on his punches, came forward, and began to crank vicious body shots, and the momentum had definitely turned. But then Hearns began to box. Skillfully. Staying out of harm's way. Wary of Sugar Ray's power. And a funny thing happened. The Hitman's boxing, his movement and excellent jabbing, began winning him the late rounds, prompting legendary cornerman Angelo Dungee's famous blast at Leonard: ""You're blowing it now, son! You're blowing it!"" Leonard proved to be a good listener. His rocket right hand in the 13th round hurt Hearns all over again, and Leonard went kabonkers with the furious combinations. Scheduled for 15 rounds, Hearns wouldn't survive past the 14th, on a semi-controversial referee stoppage. This was a great, great fight and, ultimately, the outcome hinged on who had the braver chin. On that night, Sugar Ray Leonard had the heroic chinny chin chin.",1317427200,3,5563,4.723711340206186
