5404756,4,B00AADAIMM,"I am very glad that I came across this DVD as it turns out it was released just last month (June 2013).
Well made and carries a good pace..

I have seen tens of documentaries and this one stands out, not so much because it was flawlessly made but because the content is very rich, relevant and clearly presented. Footage of the excavation of the boat from 1986 is shown.  The interview with the two fishermen who had dreamed of finding something significant in the sea of Galilee all their lives..

A four year drought in Israel before this incredible find made it illegal to even wash one's car because water was so scarce.  This caused the recession of water in some areas of the the Sea of Galilee which caused this 2,000 year old boat to appear.  The boat was buried in mud which preserved it from bacteria and decomposition.  The moment the researchers found the boat, it started pouring rain!

This film also discusses the prophetic aspects of Israel as a nation such as the predicted diaspora (dispersion of the Jews) and the eventual return to the land in the late 1940's.  The predictions of the destruction of the temple which Jesus clearly stated are portrayed in detail when in A.D. 70 the Romans destroyed the temple.  ""As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, ""Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!""
""Do you see all these great buildings?"" replied Jesus. ""Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."" [from Mark 13]

A great archeological find and the journey of its discovery and rescue as well as the prophetic trail of the nation of Israel from ancient history to this day following many Old and New Testament predictions that tie the text to history.

Good for skeptics as well as believers
Well worth it
Two thumbs up!",1373414400,5,1820,4.62111801242236
5404757,5,B00AADAIMM,"This film is about a very ancient boat found in the Sea of Galilee.  The cinematography and narration are superb.  It helps build up one's belief in Jesus. It points out bible passages supporting the existence of Jesus, his apostles, his ministry as well as prophetic verses which have been fulfilled and those that are still yet to be.  This DVD will definitely be a part of my collection.  It is worth viewing again and again.  I highly recommend it.",1372291200,6,452,4.6

8549098,5,B00AADAIMM,"In the last few months our Bible study has been looking at what the Bible has to say about the end times. We will be studying Revelations in the fall with this theme in mind. Jesus Boat gave some insight into the importance of understanding how the future prophecies related to Israel play a role in all this. I found the movie fascinating. It made some points about the history of Israel, specifically how it was formed shortly after WWII, that I had not thought of before. Overall, I highly recommend watching it.",1465171200,,515,4.548387096774194

Wow.  Jesus Boat Witness to Prophecy was an absolutely awesome movie.  I previewed the DVD documentary this evening with my Bible reading, history loving teenagers and my husband.  All want to watch it again.

This was a well organized historical documentary that was anything but dry and boring. The entire nation of Israel is a miracle. It is the only nation that was ever born in a day. Jesus Boat revealed prophecies from thousands of years ago from both the Old and New Testaments, including those of Jesus himself, and showed their fulfillment. That was so valuable to me.  Although I've read the Old and New Testaments repeatedly, I simply do not understand prophecy.

Jesus Boat Witness to Prophecy showed not only how the Jesus Boat was found in 1986 by fishermen, excavated, and preserved, but gave a super overview of the history of the area of Galilee in Israel that Jesus lived and preached in as well as a history of Jerusalem.

In our family, music often makes the movie.  The music that accompanied this movie set the mood and built interest and intensity at the appropriate times.  Well done.

I highly recommend this movie. This is the best documentary I've watched in ages. I think my children would agree. I've made them watch many documentaries over the years. They wanted to watch this one and want to watch it again. I invite you to watch the trailer, then read the press release below.",1420588800,,1452,4.703557312252965
8549101,4,B00AADAIMM,"Drawn against a strong historical background of Israel's destruction and reemergence in the last few decades for the first 22 minutes or so, this archaeological documentary shows the boat in question was first discovered in 1986 by two fishermen who stumbled upon it in the mud of the Sea of Galilee.
Archaeologists confirmed the vessel dated from the first century and eventually moved it to a nearby museum. What is considered almost a miracle is that the wooden ship survived decomposition in fresh water for almost twenty centuries!

Drawing a parallel around this discovery and the life of Jesus as we have learned from the Bible, the movie JESUS BOAT does not claim the boat was used by Christ but was in fact of the type built and used by fishermen of the region, such as Jesus and his disciples used to cross the sea of Galilee.

I found  it fascinating that when most boats used 2 or perhaps 3 different types of wood this one used 12 different woods, another parallel with the 12 known disciples perhaps? Then you have the fact that this boat was lost about the same time as Jesus walked on the very same shore...

Coincidence or not, it is none the less a valuable artifact and the scholars featured in the movie agree this almost forgotten find should not go unchecked!

Well worth seeing and thus earning 4 stars.

8549102,5,B00AADAIMM,"I don't remember hearing about the discovery of the boat, but the documentary did sound intriguing. The DVD is is better than I had hoped for, and one that I recommend to all believers and history buffs. Called the Jesus boat because it has been dated to the time when Jesus was on Earth, it was discovered by brothers, Moshe and Yuval Lufan, during a severe drought in the 1980s. This story alone, with the trials of carefully excavating the boat, various groups claiming ownership, and time factors that had to be considered, along with the tales of God's blessings and solutions to problems are fascinating on their own. But, I was completely absorbed in the realization of all of the prophecy fulfilled as Scripture was compared to historical events. This DVD is one that historians (particularly of Jewish history) and those with an interest in archaeology...or even fishing, will enjoy. As a Christian, this documentary made the Bible come even more vividly to life.

Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this DVD from Elliot Wallach to review. I was not required to write a positive review.",1417219200,,1098,4.840425531914893
8549103,5,B00AADAIMM,"This is a nonfiction movie about Israel, Jesus, Jewish history, and finding a boat. Not just any boat, but a boat that was used during the time that Jesus was on Earth, particularly the area in which the boat was recovered.

The movie shows the importance of Jesus and his predictions during his life time. Many of his predictions came true although they were made thousands of years ago. The movie also shows the importance of boats like these which were used by fishermen. Fish was indeed a staple for the people of Jesus time. The movie also shows the struggles of the Jewish people due to the Romans and other invaders.

The boat was actually located due to ancient coins and other artifacts that were found in the same area. The archaeologists painstakingly dug it up and today it is in a museum.

An interesting event occurred after the boat was completely uncovered, they found it was being eaten away by worms once out of the water and mud. It was a fisherman of the area who solved the problem by using goldfish to eat the worms.

If you enjoy history, I believe you will find this movie fascinating and worth taking the time to watch it.

8549104,5,B00AADAIMM,"2000 years ago much of what was Ancient Israel was destroyed and with it the hopes of the history of the Jewish people and their culture. It is also surprising that with each day, discoveries are being made that not only validate Ancient Israel but fulfill Bible Prophecy and Jesus' Words to the most minute detail. Following some of the great theologians of our day including Franklin Graham, Joel Rosenberg, Jay Sekulow, Skip Heitzig, and Chuck Smith along with some notated archaeologists as they share with you the most recent discovery ever made in the Sea of Gailee.

In the DVD documentary Jesus Boat: Witness to Prophecy by Edify Films, we get a look at not only the history of the destruction of Ancient Israel, the Jewish Temple to the fall of Ancient Rome, but also a divine unveiling of what could quite possibly be one of the fishing boats that the disciples used or even the very same one as Jesus used. The Sea of Gailee is quite small by comparisons of most seas you would think of, measuring just 12 miles long by 7 miles while. Jesus' ministry all took place in a 12-mile radius. His disciples according to the Bible were fisherman.

Scripture references of Isaiah 9:1-2, in which ""he will honor Gailee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan - the people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in a land of deep darkness, a light has dawned."" This brings a discovery of a boat found beneath the mud in the Sea of Gailee by two fisherman brothers, the Lufans, after a 4 year long drought in Israel. What they found there besides the 2000 year old fishing boat, were Jewish and Roman coins along with a Widow's mite which is what Jesus said the widow placed in the offering that was greater than all the other money given by the people. It was the equivalent of bread and lodging for a day.

Just as the archaeologist's laid their hands on the boat, it began to rain, after so many years of drought in Israel. While the men were praying, the rain suddenly stopped and a double rainbow appeared. The boat would turn out to be 27 feet long and 7 1/2 feet wide, handcrafted by 12 different types of wood. There are more surprising divine signs as you watch this documentary that showcases not only how relevant this is to Israel's history but to further document the Bible in its authenticity.

I received Jesus Boat: Witness to Prophecy compliments of Edify Films and Edify Media Group for my honest opinion. Aside from a free copy of the DVD, I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review. The opinions expressed in this review are strictly my personal opinion. I love that the Bible is being authenticated with new discoveries happening all the time. It validates what I have believed that the Bible is 100% accurate. This is a great documentary that showcases Israel's history from the destruction of Jerusalem as predicted by Jesus, to the discovery of a plaque in a Rome coliseum that validates the Temple to what these discoveries mean from authenticating Bible prophecy. I easily give this one a 5 out of 5 stars.",1416182400,,3095,4.581227436823105
