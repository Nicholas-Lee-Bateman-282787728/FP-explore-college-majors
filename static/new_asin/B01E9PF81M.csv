7734154,3,B01E9PF81M,"We have most of the Lego super hero movies and they are all pretty silly but this one is the worst. I dread when the kids put this one in. If you're not sure which to buy, i recommend you go with any of the others.",1473638400,,214,3.6739130434782608

7734157,5,B01E9PF81M,"It's the new favorite between me and my four-year-old son.  As incredible as The Lego Movie was, don't let the direct-to-video nature of these releases have you thinking that they're inferior. On the contrary, I think the humor and charm rival its big-screen counterpart.  A fun and cute little movie for all ages, especially overgrown kids such as myself!",1472256000,,356,5.016949152542373
7734158,5,B01E9PF81M,"Great, funny addition to the DC animation verse.",1471910400,,48,5.125
7734159,5,B01E9PF81M,"My son's newest favorite movie. He has recently started to get into legos and super heros, and this is the best of both worlds for him. We just got the movie today and he's already watched it twice. He likes it better than the Lego Movie, and I think it's because of the super heros.",1471737600,,283,4.163636363636364
7734160,5,B01E9PF81M,"My son could not be happier with this birthday gift.  If you have children, grandchildren, relatives, or friends who enjoy the Lego Batman movies, this is a great addition.  We love the convenience of also being able to stream this movie on VUDU wherever we go.  It is great to not have to bring the physical DVD along with us if we travel, or even if my son wants to view it in a different room.",1471392000,,396,4.184210526315789
7734161,5,B01E9PF81M,The latest in the Lego Justice League videos.  My son is a Batman fan and this line of videos caters very well to him.  My son loves them and I don't mind at all watching them with him.,1471305600,,185,3.8421052631578947

7734177,5,B01E9PF81M,I'm not sure why everyone is acting like this movie is out yet. It comes out 7/12. I'm giving it five stars now because I know my son and I will love it. We love all these movies.,1467590400,,179,3.736842105263158
7734178,5,B01E9PF81M,Great superhero fun for all ages!,1467072000,,33,4.666666666666667
7734179,4,B01E9PF81M,"First off, my kids liked it so it can't be all bad.  As a parent it was okay but not as good as some of the others. It is worth renting and watching once but probably not past that. And yes I have seen it.",1466985600,2,205,3.5555555555555554
7734180,5,B01E9PF81M,I don't think the other reviewers have seen this movie. I certainly haven't. But LEGO Justice League has stepped up its game significantly since LEGO Batman The Movie: DC Super Heroes Unite (basically a supercut of the LEGO Batman 2 video game). Each Justice League release has been better and funnier than the last. I'm excited about this one because we finally return to Gotham City and meet the Bat-family!,1466294400,3,409,4.857142857142857

8758208,5,B01E9PF81M,"My 2 year old loves this movie. It is one of those movies that you end up watching repeatedly; however, it is tolerable even after the 3rd viewing.",1508803200,,147,4.285714285714286
8758209,5,B01E9PF81M,Fun movie. Special packaging gives you free nightwing lego figure with movie. These are the lego movies before they started making major release features so they don't have famous voices and are fairly short. About 1hr to 1:15. Fun for the kiddos and good way to allow some screen time without dedicating 2hrs to on movie.,1508112000,,322,4.767857142857143
