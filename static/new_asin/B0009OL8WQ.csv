8064249,2,B0009OL8WQ,"Black and white Alpha video. Hester Engle (Evelyn Brent) is accused of murder and is being framed. Ex-policeman/detective Duke Martindale (Neil Hamilton) and his sleuth wife Phyllis (June Storey), whom just happened to be attorney, believe that someone in the police force is doing the framing. Meanwhile his nemesis in the force, Police Sergeant Brent (Douglas Fowley) thinks that duke is responsible for a murderer and covering up for Hester.

Unfortunately, this movie is mediocre in many ways.

See June Storey again, in ""The Lone Wolf Takes a Chance"" (1941) which is part of the Lone Wolf series of movies.",1264204800,2,611,5.1
8064250,2,B0009OL8WQ,"I had high hopes for this since I love June Storey. Ever since I saw her adorable performance in ""In Old Chicago"", I've been a fan. This was one of the few ventures outside of the Gene Autry territory for her. It's too bad it's mediocre.
June Storey and Neil Hamilton play married detectives a la Thin Man but they don't have the chemistry that William Powell and Myrna Loy supplied. The plot concerns them proving Evelyn Brent's innocent of murder. It's kind hard to follow. Even with only being a hour long this movie dragged. Film quality also left much to be desired.
I hope her movie Dance Hall with Carole Landis gets released one day.",1147046400,3,641,4.487179487179487
