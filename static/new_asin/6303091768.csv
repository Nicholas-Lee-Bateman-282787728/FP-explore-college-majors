7838039,4,6303091768,"Good thriller. great performances from Eric Roberts and John Lithgow. Mdchen Amick, beautiful woman. Please, I want it on dvd",1253059200,4,125,5.3
7838040,5,6303091768,"John Lithgow and Eric Roberts are two fantastic actors. John Lithgow is not a bad guy this time, but outsmarts Eric Roberts who is the ultimate of scoundrels. This is a very seldom heard of movie that should not be missed!!!",1227571200,,224,4.487804878048781
7838041,2,6303091768,"Skinny leads who confuse sadomasochism for a meaningful relationship double-cross one another along with John Lithgow, until everyone, by default, is double-crossing him- or herself, not to mention everyone in the phone book whose surname starts with the same letter as theirs. If this is your idea of entertainment, seek this one out. I'm thinking of feeding mine to the dumpster. Two stars, and only because the brilliant John Lithgow can make anything worth watching while he's on the screen.",1043798400,,495,5.2
7838042,5,6303091768,"A stylish keep 'em guessing thriller with top-notch talent and clever twists and dialogue.  The writer-director really knows his stuff and keeps the pace moving.  Roberts is excellent as are many of the secondary characters.  Unfortunately, the girl isn't very good.  Five stars.  Better than anything on TV and much of what's on the big screen.",983404800,3,345,5.089285714285714
7838043,4,6303091768,A tight noirish thriller with some surprising twists and turns.  Definately a cut above the usual fare.  I especially liked the acting and the look of the picture.  Writer-director Curran gets high marks for his stylish direction on a shoe-string budget and his imaginative plot and snappy dialogue.  A top recommend.,983318400,,317,5.1568627450980395
7838044,4,6303091768,"Eric Roberts probably deserved an award for his performance in this flick.  Roberts plays a convicted bank robber who was set up and sent to jailby his ex-wife who he discovers has since married a rich banker in California.  . Roberts breaks out of jail, kills 2 guards, promptly bangs a girl he picks up at a landromat and then proceeds to find his ex-wife and make her life a living hell.  I don't want to give the whole movie away, but it's worth the buy.  The whole cast is pretty good (John Lithgow, Madchin Amick, etc.)  Eric Roberts is a sinister sociopath and this is a vintage performance for him.",920764800,9,606,4.423423423423423
