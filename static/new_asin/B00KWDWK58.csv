8662172,4,B00KWDWK58,"This all-region disc was the only media I could locate for viewing this film so I just bought it outright.  And, after viewing it, I'd say it comes close to (or possibly) exceeds the original.  All the characters here get stronger backstories and the backdrop is far more politically charged.  Those elements, to me, make this a much more compelling drama - and I'm a HUGE fan of Eastwood's original film.",1496102400,,405,4.676056338028169

8662174,4,B00KWDWK58,"Is it better than the masterpiece that it is based on. NO but it is very damn a good film. Beginning and ending is different. Middle is slower?Ken Watanabe is magnificent as the Eastwood role. See the original first and if you want to see a slightly different version via eastern mindset,check this one too.",1470614400,2,307,4.6
