1655659,5,B00005RHGK,"Finally - a teen horror film that actually looks creepy. It looks like the best teen horror film since THE FACULTY. JEEPERS CREEPERS is about a brother and a sister coming home from college. Along the road, they end up being chased by this strange creature who is out to get the brother. Although the two main actors in this film are hardly unknown (this must be their debut film), they are very good actors. The plot is pretty simple so the movie can actually have more time to scare you. JEEPERS CREEPERS looks really good and I can't wait to see it!",999216000,,552,4.368932038834951
1655660,3,B00005RHGK,"Okay, maybe watching the movie with a theatre full of jaded movie obsessed freaks ( myself included ) was a bad idea. However as fate would have it I found myself doing just that. Jeepers Creepers DOES possess a certain element of campiness which I haven't seen since oh, 'The Forsaken' It not only manages to match 'The Forsaken's' level of cheesiness and predictability but exceeds it. While Jeepers Creepers is not a BAD movie, neither is it good, and therefore I cannot fully endorse it.
The Good: It's not your average hack and slash thriller. Tons of gratuitious violence, a surprising lack of nudity, and a moderately intrigueing premise. I must also give the actors credit for not breaking down while the camera was rolling, at times it seemed like a game of trying to count how many times they could shout ""hello, Is anyone there?"" Some of the scenes are atmosphereic enough and I actually liked those few centering around the diner for both dialogue and characterization.
The Bad: What promises to be a somewhat interesting premise degenerates into typical banality. The direction was alright, however the key establishing shots managed to make everyone in the theatre burst into laughter rather than have the desired foreshadowing effect. Plot points remained unresolved, and those that were tied up did so unsatisfactorily.
In conclusion: A slightly above average campy horror film with lots of blood and gore to make all but the most jaded horror fans cringe. If that's your thing, you'll love it. If however you're more conservative in your tastes give it a miss.",999216000,,1577,4.932330827067669
1655661,4,B00005RHGK,"I saw ""Jeepers Creepers"" at the Fantasy-Film-Fest in Hamburg and I must say that I couldn't have been more pleased by a movie of this kind - a very creepy monster-flick with extreme suspence!",997574400,10,191,4.647058823529412
1655662,5,B00005RHGK,"Since Halloween,Psycho,Friday The 13th,A Nightmare On Elm Street, there haven't really been any good scary movies. Now this looks like its gonna be really scary!!.On the theatrical release commercial at the movies,two teens are in the middle of nowhere see a weird guy throw a rug down a tunnel in a cave. The teens stop by the cave to investigate. The boy teen looks down the tunnel while the girl teen holds his feet. Then the girl teen sees an animal or something and lets go of his feet. The teen slides down the tunnel and when he finally gets to the bottom of the cave, he finds millions of bodies wrapped in rugs. Then the teen sees a guy in a black dark robe and screams as loud as he can. To me it looks really good. There were a couple of failures before this. Like Urban Legends:Final Cut, a terrible sequel,Stigmata, which wasn't even scary or gory. Jeepers Creepers will be released in all theatres widely August 31st. Rated R for strong horror/violence,language, and brief nudity.",994982400,18,994,4.589887640449438

1655687,2,B00005RHGK,"Movie suffers from being too predictable. Every bi-stander or authority figure just seems to serve as a plot device to keep them in town where the monster lives. Tons of cheesy exposition by the resident psychic, too many cops just being stupid, and other parental authorities are non-existent.

They also show the monster too early, have written lines like ""You know that in horror movies this happens? Well you are doing something dumber."" Whatever tension the film had was suddenly lost as they show him in almost full light. Why not have him hidden in the shadows like in ""The Mothman Prophecies""? Why not give him some more backstory? It just feels like plain lazy writing.

Another thing, In 2001 at least one person should at least have a working cell phone. An lastly, a serial killer / missing person case as consistent as the monster should at least have more than a handful of cops on this case.

I wanted to like this movie, but it might as well have ended with a huge ""TOO BE CONTINUED""  too campy, gross and predictable.",1503014400,,1034,4.633879781420765

 This movie really had a lot of potential, but fails to deliver.

1655767,3,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers (it seems to me) is a throwback to the 1950's horror movies. The first half of the movie is awesomely great until they go to the diner and get the mysterious phone call from the black woman. And what does the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" have to do with the plot? To me that is the silliest part of the whole movie. This movie should have (could have) been made better. I give it 3 stars for the ""creepers"".
  But don't get me wrong: this is a good scary freaky movie to watch on a Saturday night with your girl or friends if you are horror movie lovers.",1474329600,,566,4.18348623853211

1655771,3,B00005RHGK,"Damn, this started off so great for me. It had everything going for it until it became obvious that Justin Long was going to carry the movie. That was just one of the reasons this movie kept me from completely enjoying it. Now, I know that a lot of horror movies requires the plot and cast to do a run down on every possible cliche in order to build mood and suspense but at some point this movie was nothing but that. Could there be two characters more annoying and unwittingly stupid than Justin Long's and Gina Philips' characters. It took the old cliche of creating a situation where you put yourself in more danger and then just took it over the top, only this time with Justin Long's character behaving as annoyingly erratic as he could possibly be. I attribute this not to the character but to Justin Long being one of the most amateurish actors around. The interaction between them was so forced and hammy that an attack by the creature was a welcomed relief. Every character in this movie was portrayed to have absolutely not a single ounce of common sense if only for the purpose to propel the action and the bloodbath. Characters hung around and stared at the beast instead of fleeing, cops stared at the beast devouring an inmate without firing their weapons and on and on... Then they bring out the psychic character portrayed by an actress who appeared to be performing as if she were on a theater stage and was trying to recite the dialogue from memory. Just some good old fashion bad acting. I don't recall ever hearing an explanation why the beast existed in the first place. A wasted opportunity from a hammy director and a clueless cast.",1471824000,,1656,4.54180602006689

  Sometime later, on the same highway, Darry sees the truck again parked by the side of an old church. The weirdo is taking something out of the truck, wrapped in a sheet and dumping it down a large sewer pipe in the ground. The sheet had blood stains on it. They see the man's darkend face (Jonathan Breck). Trish tries to use her cell phone, but it is not working way out there. Suddenly again, the man chases after them in the old delivery truck on the highway. This time Darry and Trish are ran off the road into the field.

1655792,5,B00005RHGK,"Horror movies are not really my favorite types of movies to watch, esp. if they have a lot of killing & gore. I like certain horrors like ""The Exorcist;"" ""Amityville Horror;"" (the 1st) ""Halloween"" & ""It;"" horror movies along these lines because there's a story line of some substance; not just a bunch of killing & gore. Well, I saw the trailer for ""Jeepers Creepers"" & I wasn't going to watch it because I thought it may be too much killing & gore but surprisingly it was not; it had some but not too much. This movie had a good story line, the acting was great; esp. by the creature; the lady who could see things before they happen; the cat lady & definitely Justin Long; the lead character who plays the brother. He really knows how to play somebody who is traumatized & distraught; I know I really believed him. That human-like creature was very creative and he was also scary as hell to me because he seemed a little bit more human-like & real rather than fictional. That creature walking around all hard like a man with that scary face & flying around all fast & hard had me nerved up after I watched this movie. It took me a while to get myself together. It's a good movie but if you're scary it would be best that you watch it in the daytime rather than nighttime so you'll have time to get over it & avoid having nightmares.",1458086400,2,1334,4.318725099601593

1655794,5,B00005RHGK,Jeepers Creepers is the film that I think the horror genre needed. Since nowadays there hasn't been many original horror films to come out in the last few years. Too many pointless remakes of classic horror movies. Jeepers Creepers adds something fresh. Finally a new monster. One thing I enjoyed when I first saw Jeepers Creepers is you don't quite know what the creeper is at first. Slowly as the movie goes on it reveals the creeper. At first one night think that he is simply just a killer but more is revealed you realize that he is something completely different. Trish and Darry are really good and likable characters they are the ones we spend most of the movie. I really liked them as lead characters. the creeper is revealed to be hungry and feeds on body parts from certain people that have something that he likes. the creepers tracks Trish and Carry when he senses that one of them has something that he likes. The Creeper van is also a very cool thing it fits the creeper its a very creepy truck. I think Jeepers Creepers is a very good monster horror movie it does have a lot of original elements. The Creeper is a very different creature he gets to eat every 23rd spring and he starts his feeding spree. If you're a fan of horror films I would recommend Jeepers Creepers and the sequel Jeepers Creepers 2,1457308800,,1320,4.481327800829876

It was unfortunate that his career was derailed as I am sure he would have gone on to bigger and better things but going to prison did not help him. The two lead actors were very good and I thought their careers would have reached greater heights also but sometimes early promise does not pan out into more high profile careers. I thought that one of Salva's other films Powder was also very good. I liked Salva's visual sense in both films and Powder was also well acted like Jeepers Creepers.,1446249600,,627,4.557522123893805

1655851,5,B00005RHGK,"Every 23 years, it feeds for 23 days...

I've watched this film several times and it's always as scary as it was when I saw it in a theater.  Perhaps it's because it doesn't follow the usual cliche and when you think it's going to go the accepted way, it doesn't.

There's no explanation of what the creature is or why he's only allowed that small span of time to terrorize but in the end it doesn't mater because terrorize he does...aplenty.

Whatever the reason, this story of two homeward bound college students who run afoul of a mansized cannibalistic gargoyce is eerie, scary, and simply a very good horror film.  From the moment the two bickering siblings meet up with the armor-truck like vehicle on the deserted road past the point where the brother teases his sister about falling for the investigating officer while that same officer is being killed tin the car behind them to the shock of a finish, it's passes on all point for being all a horror film should be.

Justin Long with his huge, horror-filled eyes is great as Darry and Gina Phelps stubborn and determined as his sister.  I give it 5 stars (every time I watch it).  Knowing what's going to happen ahead of time doesn't change it one bit.",1430265600,,1211,4.522935779816514
1655852,4,B00005RHGK,"The road trip to hell, featuring two irritating siblings (Gina Philips as Trish and Justin Long as Darry).  They bicker, they snipe, they call each other names, argue, quarrel, maintain an endless squabble throughout.  It was actually a relief when the Mad Max type vehicle began to chase them.  It did not, as hoped, shut them up.  Instead, these two nitwits thought it a swell plan to investigate what looked like a body dump.  They quickly gave into curiosity and soon discovered a body-filled room beneath an abandoned church.  Everything they did from that point on confounds rational behavior in favor of cheap thrills and low-grade fright.  Especially annoying (not to mention bizarre), these infuriating twits spend an inordinate amount of time just gawking, mouths agape, standing stock still, gawking.  When they're not arguing about a stupid song while a cop is being killed.  A scene that allows them to get out of their car and gape while the Creeper strolls around whistling the tune they were arguing about.  Also, there are several too many scenes where these siblings actually park during a chase sequence and waste time arguing.  They have a monster on their trail but heaven forefend they give up fighting and do something that might actually save their lives!  I might have had more sympathy for their plight had they not been so obnoxious.

But.  Even so.  I still liked this movie (mainly because of the Creeper and some of the supporting characters).  There was also a well realized sense of impending doom rather than any genuine scares, which I appreciated.  I just wish the brother and sister hadn't been so thoroughly unlikeable.  The whole point is to feel sorry for the victim(s), not want them dead sooner rather than later.  If it isn't already, it should be a crime to be that stupid.",1429574400,,1816,4.856677524429967

1655879,2,B00005RHGK,"Unnecessary teen film has echoes of a lot of older horror film products (from ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" to ""The Silence of the Lambs"") but lacks the urgency and imagination of those older titles, so essentially it remains quite an empty experience. It is interesting that Francis Ford Coppola has attempted to transfer himself into the Godfather of underground horror (acting as a long distance cousin executive producer, no less) but here, he has not created a paradigm for himself in a critical sense at all. Director Salva has a lot of enthusiasm, but due to a shaky budget, he was forced to cut down the final act of his script dramatically, and thereby short-changing the audience of any suitable finish to the story. However, this development did not seem to hurt what was essentially a rather tepid bit of tripe from the get-go; Salva thinks that it was wise to not explain anything about the film's dominating monster figure, but really it only renders this story even more ridiculous than it is. If you're younger, you might find the opening scenes a bit disturbing, but this is not at all that scary, and it really is not an essential stop along the back roads of horror movie history either.
The cast (especially the vibrant, beautiful Gina Phillips) is quite appealing really, and for a rushed affair sometimes the film builds up a genuinely taught pace and energy. But really, there is so little to recommend the film, despite the beginning scenes which feature some lush cinematography. The MGM DVD has a passable widescreen transfer, and the film comes with an audio commentary by Salva in which he talks you through the making of the film and offers some insights about the production (I did find it amusing that he put himself up on the wall as one of the serial killer's many victims; those who create horror are usually the first victims of such things, Salva seems to be saying, and I can appreciate his black sense of humor here). A good DVD presentation as far it goes, but it can't save this wannabe children's film hiding in the skin of an adult horror movie and masquerading around as a potentially fun picture.

As all horror movies, or any movies for that matter, goes it does has it's downfall.  However, it was surprisingly well made and entertaining.  I won't repeat what other reviews already stated.  I do however recommend that if you like the horror genre and have couple of hours to kill, this movie is sure to make the time fly.  Be sure to check out the sequel also, which I think is better than this first one which is already good.  How how many sequels can claim the title of out doing the first one?",1421193600,,599,4.2105263157894735
1655881,5,B00005RHGK,"Aaaaaack!!!! Major league cringe factor.

One of the things that's so brilliant about this film are the siblings. They behave and bicker like siblings and you grow to like them; they're just a pair of nice college kids coming home from college. Justin Long is wonderfully charming in all his movies and the sister was portrayed well also.
You really get to know them both and their distinct personalities, but the director also draws cleverly on the classic cliches yet they work so beautifully here.
If you have a dread fear of long dark deserted roads and running out of gas, this movie is for YOU!

There's also a bit of the battle of the sexes thing between brother and sister which is also very charming and amusing. It seems it's the boys that always look for trouble and make the bad decisions, whereas it's the girls who are more sensible......so they say.

The director is also a genius in understanding how to psychologically evoke the viewers sensory reactions; when the brother falls into the sewer pit you really believe that he comes out smelling real bad. I think any director can show someone falling into a pile of manure but that in itself doesn't necessarily make you hold your nose. This director just has that touch. Bravo, excellent thrill ride!

Applauds for the costume/makeup/special effects people too. The creature was really well done, not ridiculous, overdone or sloppy. It just worked....perfectly!

BTW, watch Justin Long in ""Drag Me To Hell"", another excellent horror film; more humor actually than scare value but it's a winner.",1421107200,,1561,4.875471698113207

The story is about a brother and sister on the way back home for spring break. On the way they encounter a creature that eats human flesh. The first half of the movie is quite good, establishing a believable brother-sister relationship and setting the tone of what is to come. However, the second half is a bit more routine and could have done better without trying to explain what the creature was. Still, the ending was pretty good and I was never bored throughout the entire running time. The creature effects were also really well done.

I LOVE the gory stuff, not to common...but my favorite scene is also like the Urban Legend of the high beams.....The rest is a rant....which we'll get to in a minute. But my FAVORITE scene is when they're in the car....and they play that cool version of Jeepers Creepers on the radio.....while completely oblivious to the creature who's on top of the cop car behind then....THEN.....it hacks the cops head clean off! Now for the rant......1st and foremost...why do they keep changing the creature? It's like 3 times in the movie, the cat lady scene is confusing and REALLY NOT needed.....and they should've had an ending that made sense.....cause a creature (who's changed 3 times.....suddenly has become like a human stalker that knew about this guy like years back because he was keeping tabs on him? That Doesn't make sense! And it certainly doesn't add up to let's go make some sequels....so except for my scene....I'm giving this a big thumbs down!",1385683200,2,1246,4.720183486238532

One of the worst horror movies that I have seen. Skip this movie.",1376265600,,346,4.375

And the second story just sucks so bad.

The two stories are in chronological order, so it won't be hard to figure out which one I'm talking about, and I'm sure you'll end up agreeing with me.

If you like horror, it's 100% worth watching the first half of this movie.",1375488000,,408,4.4
1656048,4,B00005RHGK,"The acting by both main characters, a brother and sister was superb. The only question is why Justin went on to have an ongoing successful career in moviemaking when the incredibly gorgeous young lady that played his sister hasn't been seen by me anyway since I saw this movie. She is certainly a good actress and is one of those heart stoppingly gorgeous women that a person sees about once a month if they both get out a lot and are lucky. Man, ""hot"" doesn't quite cover the lass as a description. She would literally take the air out of a room full of men when she entered.......oh well.
Great movie full of just about everything wants in a typical horror movie. Evil, eteranal shape-shifting monster with his own dungeoun covered in his years worth of victims bodies. A spooky psychic black lady that sees all and knows all but who of course is ignored by everyone and........well, to go any further would ruin the movie.
If anyone knows where I can find a poster of the actress that plays the sister role in this movie, let me know. If anyone knows of her appearing in anything else besides this movie, let me know that as well!
I highly recommend at LEAST renting this movie. Purchasing a used copy from one of Amazons many vendors might be a good idea as it is worthy of an additional viewing from time to time and the small businesses that depend on Amazon for a large portion of their income could use the very few dollars this movie would cost.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys the horror genre. The only disappointment was that the gorgeous old Chevrolet the brother and sister were driving was a four door rather than a two door. I would consider giving up a testicle for a two door version of the (initially), very clean old classic 1959 or 1960 Chevrolet the two are featured driving across country.",1375401600,,1832,4.504504504504505

1656056,4,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers is a straight-forward horror movie with a more intimate feel than the typical Jason/Michael unstoppable supernatural monster antagonist chasing around teens trope. It focuses on a brother and sister who have the unfortunate luck of crossing the path of the bad guy, who is convincingly frightening. The siblings do their share of dumb things to get all of the mayhem kicked off and proceed to partake in a tense cat and mouse game with what appears to be an unstoppable force of nature. The movie is fun, tense, and handled well enough to never become insulting and the ending is particularly surprising. See, Jeepers Creepers actually builds the siblings' characters up enough that you kind of care about what happens to them. They are not just the proverbial meat market of cliche weekend camper killer bait.  So, at the end, you are invested in what happens to the two of them, which is a factor that is missing from a lot of other films in the genre.",1370736000,,971,4.745562130177515

1656062,5,B00005RHGK,"Since I discovered this film at a rental store and liked it well enough to buy a copy, I had no idea how many viewers actively disliked it. [On Amazon, the number of ""4 Star"" reviews is virtually identical to the number of ""1 Star"" reviews!] After reading some of the more negative responses to the film, I think I realize better why I like it as much as I do. It is clearly not a typical modern ""Raimi/Romero/ slasher/gore horror-fest, but a throwback to the classic thrillers that established an existential (albeit) supernatural menace...and then left us to enjoy the excitement (and terror) of imagining ourselves in the protagonists' position. Boris Karloff once complained in an interview that he disliked hearing his early films like FRANKENSTEIN and THE MUMMY referred to as ""Horror Movies."" [He preferred the word ""Terror.""] He pointed out (very politely) that any idiot can throw gruesome images on the screen and edit them in such a way as to make an audience scream and clutch each other. [It's the cinematic equivalent of startling a child by yelling ""Boo!""] But it takes a certain amount of ingenuity to persuade an audience that they should be frightened of something that they know (intellectually) doesn't really exist. It takes a special talent to make intelligent people yield to a willing suspension of disbelief. If you like rapid-paced slasher films, you might want to give this film a pass. But if you like the supernatural stories of E.F. Benson or Arthur Machen, or films like Karloff's THE MUMMY, you should enjoy the ride.",1368144000,,1549,4.871212121212121

1656074,3,B00005RHGK,"""You know the part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid, and everybody hates them for it? This is it."" Trish and Darry are stalked by a terrifying man-eating creature while on their way home for spring break in 2001's JEEPERS CREEPERS! Victor Salva directs from his own original screenplay, which is lazy, messy, and misguided from the very start. JEEPERS CREEPERS opens as a suspenseful thriller, before revealing that the killer creature is actually rooted in the supernatural. Whenever the action lulls or our interest in the characters begins to fade, Salva throws in some desperate new gimmick to try and gain back his lost momentum without ever actually attempting to improve upon the story itself. The creature goes from being an axe-wielding maniac to being a cannibalistic ghoul to then tranforming into a cannibalistic ghoul with wings and mandibles which serve no other purpose than to show off the flashy special effects. At one point, Salva writes himself into a corner when attempting to explain the creature's origin or why it only eats certain people and parts of the body, and hence ""Jezelle the Psychic"" is born out of convenience and necessity. If we are to believe that the creature can only replenish its limbs and vital organs by eating the flesh of its victims, just how is it supposed to grow back those wings, anyway? As annoying as they often can be, Justin Long and Gina Phillips are goofy enough to keep us entertained as the unfortunate brother and sister team, while Jonathan Breck adds a frightening new villain to the modern Slasher genre.

1656085,3,B00005RHGK,"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.

Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.

Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.

The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.

The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over.",1352592000,2,1681,4.688135593220339

I worked at a movie theater and got to ""build"" the print (and its 2003 sequel), and I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. I didn't know if the Creeper was a man or monster. I wasn't disappointed to find out it was the latter; I would've been mad had it been some mutated hillbilly.

I love the Florida country atmosphere (I grew up in places much like the ones shown in the movie), so the film brought back some memories. There are also some great action sequences that break up the slow moments. Justin Long and Gina Phillips are great as brother and sister, with fantastic chemistry. There's just something more frightening about siblings battling a monster than boyfriend and girlfriend.

Overall, I think this is a great horror film that's very satisfying...until the depressing ending.",1351728000,,850,4.5855263157894735

I love good intelligent horror (and some really stupid horror, but not so much).  This movie is smart, funny, well-paced, and terrifying.  The relationship between the brother and sister is also very believable (and they are also both nice to look at).  Be aware that the ""F"" word is used many times.  The movie itself looks a lot better on blu-ray than the standard def version I've watched (again and again) over the years.  It is pretty gory, if you consider decapitation or running over a body multiple times to be gory.  There are a lot of dead bodies, if that bothers you.  Watch for the face off between the ""Strip-O-Gram"" cop and the Creeper; truly over-the-top.  This is one of my favorite horror films, somewhere in the top ten.

It was also nice to have a villain who wasn't a resurrected evil human or psycho killer.

Pic Quality 8/10....slight grain in certain places but not consistent!
Sound Quality 8/10......it isn't too overbearing, just perfect!

The kids investigate and see a man in a long coat and big hat dumping something down a drain, after going down said drain they discover a multitude of bodies and from then on it seems as if they are being targeted and after a few run-ins with the tall figure its clear he wants something from them but what?

Well people of course, or at least the parts of people he needs to stay alive and heal. So both brother and sister must try to avoid becoming a victim of the creeper and kill him if they can.

The story is simple, the acting is basic, the action is fun and the cliches are abound but for some unknown reason this is one fun horror flick. The ""creeper"" is a very effective monster as he just kills for the sake of killing to get what he wants and there's a great scene where Patricia & Darry run the monster over a few times, of course it doesn't end up killing him, or it wouldn't be a very good creature would it?

First of all, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is an ""okay"" horror film I guess, nothing original. But the thing that bothered me when I first saw these two movies is that there is a weird running theme that goes against normal movie convention. In Part 1, Justin Long plays the male protagonist but assumes the role of the ""female victim"". For some reason the creature becomes obsessed with him, starts stalking him and steals and sniffs his laundry. Isn't this what normally happens to the female protagonist in horror films? Unless of course the creature is gay. In Part 2, a bunch of high school football players and cheerleaders get stranded while traveling in a school bus. For some reason, the football players use this opportunity to take off their clothes and sun bathe on top of the bus. Huh?? How many men would do this? Isn't this what female characters normally do in horror films to achieve the obligatory T&A shots? Why aren't the slutty cheerleaders taking their clothes off? It gives a strange, uncomfortable quality to both movies. Later I found out the director was a convicted child molester who molested boys. NOW IT ALL MADE SENSE!!

Only thing is that don't expect a lot of gore or anything when watching this movie if you haven't seen this movie already.

So, I got this copy of ""Jeepers Creepers"" and settled in to watch it on my 60 inch HD t.v. with digital surround sound. I tell ya people, hearing flesh rip and blood spurting has never sounded more realistic. What a refreshing pleasure. (!!!).

The plot revolves around a brother and sister driving home together from college. Trish and Darry Jenner do the typical sibling annoyances we all know and love. They pass a house and see this shadowy figure dump tied up bodies into a tunnel. If that wasn't enough to freak them out, the stranger gets into a truck and tries to run them off the road. After he passes, Darry, stupidly, gets hit with some perverted moral conscience and decides to return to investigate. Trish is not happy, and even more unhappy when Darry drops into the tunnel. What he spies down there is a horror beyond his wildest dreams. He eventually finds his way out and they take off to contact the authorities.

Without giving all the plot away, this movie is about the evil stranger pursuing them. I like the suspense this movie provides and the jolts of horror throughout.
Wisely, the unknown terror is what gives the movie it's impact. You never really see the Creeper from the start. As the scenes unfold, you get to glimpse, slowly, what this creature is and, eventually, why it is pursuing them. To say that the Creeper is hideous would be an understatement. To say that Metamorpho writes the best reviews in the universe, is an understatement as well. But, that is where all similarities end, thank-you.

We learn that this creature surfaces every 23 years and has to feed off bodies (especially young people), for, to do so, he develops regenerative ability. Thus,  it's hard to kill this thing. The creature is a living, breathing, Wright Brothers Beelzebub, and also a Kitty Hawk. But, in order to really get that insanely clever line, you have to see the movie. In truth, I jumped out of my seat quite a few times and there was popcorn all over the floor. It's a good thing I hired a cleaning crew to take care of such matters.

Anyway, a pretty entertaining horror film. I gave it 3 1/2 - 4 stars. It held your interest by maintaining an underlying dread. My other underlying dread was the fear of running out of Halloween candy for the kiddies. The movie I can deal with, but egging my castle windows is another situation entirely.

1656112,4,B00005RHGK,"As ridiculous a title as this movie has, you might assume that it's a teen slasher gore-fest. But the graphic violence is minimal, and much emphasis is placed on the relationship between the two adolescent siblings, Trish and Darry. Their sibling rivalry, with its petty bickering and silly games that only the two of them understand is refreshingly accurate, and they don't become all lovey-dovey when trouble comes their way.

And trouble they have. A demon who, according to psychic Jezelle [Patricia Belcher] is permitted to feed for 23 days every 23 years is on day 22 of its eating binge. It captures young healthy people whose scent makes it wild with desire. It takes only certain parts, eyes to help it see, hearts to help its own heart stay strong and beating, and so on. Then it sews up the corpses to preserve them in a quilt, which it keeps in the basement of an old church (desecrated, no doubt). When Trish and Derry see one of the demon's sewn up, quilt-bound bodies dropped through an old pipe that leads into the basement of the church, they feel compelled to go back and see if they can help the victim. But the victim is beyond help, and now the demon has their scent, and it loves what it smells of one of them--which one, we do not know. But the demon is after them as a final addition to its collection.

Along the way, Trish and Darry never suddenly turn into best friends--they annoy the heck out of each other up until the very end. But they do band together, as siblings will, and their private games and one-ups-manship tells us that their relationship is deeper than either would admit. The love-hate feelings of siblings is very well done, and is one of the highlights of the movie. Too, like most horror movies with teen protagonists, we never see parents, and parents would be of no help. This movie, and others like it are an allegory for the transition to adulthood that we all must make on our own.

I do wish they'd thought more about the title, but Jeepers Creepers is an effective coming-of-age movie, with authentic characterizations and a fairy tale plot in a modern setting, with the traditional fairy tale goal--make the transition alive.",1288483200,,2180,4.61340206185567

1656136,4,B00005RHGK,"Writer/director Victor Salva's did intend to launch a monster franchise, but that's how things worked out, as his scary thriller Jeepers Creepers (2001), was successful enough to spawn the high action sequel Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003), and the third entry in the series Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral, is reportedly in production at this time.

The strange being known as ""The Creeper"" (Jonathan Breck), is tremendously powerful, and has the ability to fly.  He surfaces every twenty three years, and for a period of twenty three days, driven his sense of smell, he consumes humans for their body parts.  Siblings Trish (Gina Philips) and Darry Jenner (Justin Long) are travelling in Florida, when they cross the path of the Creeper's vehicle.  Later, passing an abandoned church, they again spot the Creepermobile, and observe a huge figure, grabbing body shaped bundles from the back, and tossing them down a corrugated pipe in the ground.  The Creepermobile suddenly appears behind them, and runs them off the road.  Going back to the church to investigate, Darry makes a horrific discovery in an underground cavern.

Daylight turns to darkness, while the pair awaits for police assistance.  Darry gets a phone call from a mysterious woman who warns him that something bad will happen, when he hears the song Jeepers Creepers.  The action ramps up when the Creeper gets Darry's scent, and will stop at nothing to satisfy his needs.

With lots of intimate dialog, Salva does a wonderful job of making the relationship between Trish and Darry, seem very real and natural.  It is the central thread that holds the film together, and both Justin Long (Live Free, Die Hard) and Gina Philips (Ally McBeal) turn in strong performances.  Long goes overboard at times, but that is kind of what he does.  Philips was 31 at the time, but easily passes for much younger.

The suspense is sustained, by keeping the Creeper obscured for most of the film.  Psychic Jezelle Gay Hartman (Patricia Belcher) provides key information about the creature, and a deadly prediction.  The ending is a bit unexpected, but remains true to Salva's vision.  Jeepers Creepers has its faults, but is still a well-crafted, and very effective monster movie.

The double sided DVD release, is a comprehensive package, including both widescreen and full screen versions of the film, and lots of cool bonus materials.  Victor Salva, a longtime horror aficionado, provides a fun and informative commentary track, and there are also an excellent series of featurettes covering the making of the film.  Unfortunately, nothing is heard from executive producer Francis Ford Coppola.  If you like creepy monsters, check out this series, as Jeepers Creepers 2, picks up where the first film left off, delivering big time action.  Gina Philips will reprise her role as Trish, in the upcoming third entry in the series, Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral.",1277683200,,2906,5.086497890295359

It's a horror movie that not only has blood shed in it but also suspense and thriller to it. This is a film of today that I like very much compared to many of the other horror movie's today which are mostly remakes or movies about blood and gore throughout. I like the idea of that The Creeper has to feast every 23 years on human parts in order to keep itself together. The acting I thought was prett descent too and Johnathon Breck does a great job on playing the Creeper. I had fun watching this movie throughout as well as my friends did so for that I give it 5 stars.,1249084800,2,700,3.971631205673759
1656145,1,B00005RHGK,"There's probably little more that could be done to make this the dumbest horror film ever.

A pair of siblings are driving along a lonely road and are almost run off it by a strangely looking super fast truck. Later they see the truck by a church and someone throwing what looks like wrapped up bodies down a hole in the ground.

Why there's a body dumping ground near an interstate is the first of many dumb plot points. Why the guy dumping bodies is doing so in daylight, only to chase after them and then, after running them off the road, continues on.

The siblings don't think it's a good idea to go to the cops but to go back to the site and see what was happening. Do they consider that anyone else might be around there. No. The girl says she won't be getting out of the car, but that's precisely what she does. The guy says he only wanted to look down the hole but he insists on his sister holding his feet as he dangles down the hole. They're trying to pack in so many dumb things here it's amazing.

1656156,5,B00005RHGK,"Writer/director Victor Salva's intelligent creature feature is chock full of depth, substance and an opening that will make you think twice about driving on a seemingly solitary open road.

The two charismatic leads are three dimensional portraits of two kids in the right place at the wrong time. Justin Long proves he is much more than a pretty face. His performance offers texture, subtext... and the thrilling finale provides him with a genuine tour de force. Here is a fine actor working at the top of his game (and this was back in 2001). Watch for him on a red carpet, someday... as a nominee for that famous golden statuette.

Gina Philips, whose strength and ballsyness is reminiscent of ALIENS' Ripley and H20's Laurie Strode, delivers a star-making turn. She is utterly believable, whether engaged in juvenile banter with her brother or face-to-face with the object of her nightmares.

Eileen Brennan's cameo as The Cat Lady proves how important casting even the smallest of roles is. In her all-too-brief screen time she is hilarious and touching... chilling and endearing.

Jonathan Breck's Creeper offers a truly original, thought-provoking monster; effortlessly giving Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees a run for their money as title holders for the genre's scariest baddie.

The flick's behind-the-scenes wizards deserve special mention. The cinematography, art direction, score and editing expertly compliment this first class spook fest.

1656157,5,B00005RHGK,"I am a big fan of horror movies and very rarely get scared by them, but of all of the ones that I have seen, Jeepers Creepers is deffinatly one of the scariest. Surprisingly, the movie succeeds in being very scary and creepy just from suspence and the idea of The Creeper. Don't get me wrong, it is gory and gruesome in parts, as the Creeper stalks people and steals parts of their body) but its doesnt need the gory to be scary, it is a scary movie on it's own, the gory bits are juast an added bonus!

Brother and sister college students, Darry (Justin Long) and Trish (Gina Phillips) are driving home from college to visit their parents for spring break when a mysterious stranger in a big rusty truck with a registration plate BEATINGU leads them on a harrowing car chase and tries to drive them off the road.

1656164,4,B00005RHGK,"Someone reviewed this movie before and wrote what i'm about to say again:

""I suppose that a lot of people going to the movies today have grown up on such tripe as Scary Movie, the Friday the 13th series and other crappy horror films. I suppose these same people expect that every little detail of a film must be explained on an adolescent's level, so as not to confuse them while they watch the films with their eyes as their mouths cannot keep from running while in the theatre. It's a funny thing - sound when added to a film allowed for certain nuances of the theatre to be present, so that the visual didn't have to do all the work. So to those who would call this film bad, I say: turn off your cell phone, stop talking to your buddies, and pay attention to the movie.
Jeepers Creepers isn't the finest horror film ever made, but it certainly is one that can scare the bejesus out of you. Certainly there are very standard plot devices in action here - but isn't that part of the formula for a horror film? ...

Jeepers starts off using bits and pieces of known scare tactics and then milks them with a wink and a nudge. Should the lead characters go back and see whats up at that creepy looking house where the even creepier looking guy was ....? Of course not! The characters even acknowledge this fact. However, pulled by the same force that requires everyone passing an accident to rubberneck, they do. (And let's face it - if they didn't - the movie wouldn't have been made).
At once scary, silly, laughable, and immensely frustrating, Jeepers Creepers shows us a new (albeit traditional and truly old hat) villain: a monster! .
Just what this monster wants is never fully explained as the film truly frustrates us by setting itself up for an obvious sequel (which I truly hope gets made).
The film features fine actors performing honestly and well. Eileen Brennan appears in an extended cameo that is quite unforgettable. The script is good, the cinematography is quite well done.
When you get up from a horror film, you are hopefully intelligent enough to know that the action on the screen is not possible in the real world. You have just been treated to little fright akin to a ride on a good roller coaster. If the movie made you jump, squirm, turn from the screen, or possibly yelp, then its done its job.
Jeepers Creepers does far more than that. This is a good film that delivers on the scares and leaves you wanting more.
Check it out!""

1656165,5,B00005RHGK,"I read a sampling of the 5-star reviews and a sampling of the 1-star reviews. My own review of Jeepers Creepers comes much closer to the 5-star reviews.  Like many others, I also think the 1-star reviewers failed to grasp the real horror of this film.  It's not about a scary monster so much as it is about a morbidly scared kid who in no way, shape or form deserves his fate - even though he inadvertently brings about that very fate.  The 1-star reviewers all wondered why Derry and his sister don't just keep on driving till they're safely away - and they might have been able to if Derry hadn't been unwilling to simply turn his back on the body thrown down the well. But once they gave up that one and only chance to get away, they will never be safely away from this creature who has fixed on Derry as his next victim.  This isn't your typical grab someone, anyone, and chow down monster.  This is a monster who chooses his next meal very carefully, following a very rigid protocol.  This is truly a serial-killer monster.  Okay, he flies; okay, he drives a truck that looks more like a Sherman tank.  Granted, that's a bit over the top: your typical monster wouldn't drive and fly.  He also leaps in a single bound.  And I have to admit the whole Jeepers Creepers bit falls flat; it's like the director wanted to work that song in somehow - but forgot to give some idea how the monster got addicted to it.  Most of all, the 1-star reviewers are 180 degrees off about the acting.  The acting is absolutely perfect for the movie; and Justin Long's Derry is as well-acted as anyone you're going to find in this genre.  Before the movie's half over, you know Derry like a book, inside and out - and there is more to him than just being scared out of his mind.  That happens to be good, not bad, acting.  And you genuinely care about him and what happens to him - because you come to realize that, of all the people on the planet, he's the least prepared to cope with something like this.  That counts for a lot in a movie.
By far the most disturbing aspect of this movie - and I'm tempted to think the real reason a lot of people hated it - is that the bad guy wins.  Even for a horror movie devotee like me that's quite a jolt.  You just come to expect - especially in this genre - that good will always triumph over evil.  But this time it doesn't.

Typical of that age, Darry is bringing his laundry home for his mother.  All is normal until they encounter someone with what appears to be the most severe case of road rage ever.

Out of nowhere, a massive, paint smeared, rusted, ominous truck appears.  It even comes with the loud, obnoxious, fog horn.  In a matter of no time, it's on the kid's bumper, tailgating and honking, scaring the hell out of them.  They eventually let it get by, and the license plate is revealed: BEATNGU...foreshadowing.

Just as their fear and worry has subsided, they run upon the same scary truck parked at an old, abandoned church.  The driver is outsie of the vehicle, and appears to be tossing bodies wrapped in bloody sheets down a large pipe of some sort.  Unfortunately for them, the person sees them and quickly jumps in the Fearmobile for the chase.  This time, however, the truck starts ramming the kids' car and scaring Darry and Trish until they run off the road.

What follows is a tale of fear, as brother and sister go back to investigate the pipe, and uncover a grisly reality that will shock and terrify them.

The unfortunate part of this movie is that the bad guy turns out to be a completely cheesy, winged, alien of some kind.  When it is presumed to be a mysterious, evil man, the fear is much more palpable.  But when the large human/bat/chicken thing shows itself, the tone is completely different.

1656172,5,B00005RHGK,"I saw this movie in the theatre and was a bit let down by the ending, the whole movie was full of tension and some intense images, I loved the fact that the director decided to go with the brother-sister concept and not the worn out lovers, which would have meant an unnecessary sex scene somewhere along the line(sorry all you pervs). If you listen to the directors comments, he specifically says that he did not mean for anyone to know exactly what the creeper was, he's not a demon or a gargoyle, he's just something that likes to eat parts of you.
Now this may be thinking to hard about a trivial subject BUT if you're into horror movies then you know that most of the modern day monsters are basically humans who have become immortal through their evil ways , example Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers etc etc, here we have a true supernatural being, bullets do bounce off him, you can drive over him 4 times and he keeps coming for you, with a creature like that, these circumstances are acceptable, within the movies universe.

I do have to say that this isn't your usual horror, cut-em-up, splatter flick. It actually is a creepy, spooky, intelligent scare movie with fantastic acting.
Because the main characters are teenagers the basis for this old fashioned horror has elements of innocence, fear, and the overt feeling that these kids are really terrified and alone in their nightmarish isolation.

You would kind of thought that when this beast with wings was going for its driving test someone at the driving test centre would have been alarmed in thinking this creature with wings might not be so human and seems a little bit odd but no it managed to pass its test and soon takes to the road with its truck to try run some guy & girl of the road and even when the creature itself is then ran over and then also reversed over 9 times it still manages to survive and just fly's of somewhere which makes you wonder why the hell it needed its driving licence in the first place.

1656186,3,B00005RHGK,"This is a fun time at the movies... especially the first part of the film.

But after a wonderful beginning, it does fizzle. The plot gets nonsensical and they show WAY too much of the monster. Should have taken a page from the first 'Alien' or from 'Jaws'.

It's no slasher flick, so pass if that's you're style. This is a nod to those simple but suspenseful horror films of the 70's (Duel comes to mind, as does Race With the Devil). And this movie includes a big amount of Alfred Hitchcock suspense, with a dash of tongue-in-cheek humor thrown in.

There are plot holes, yes... but there's no perfect scary film, really. And there are a couple of those cheap ""jump"" moments (you know, when there's a loud sting of music as a character pops into view out of nowhere; it's been done to absolute death in so many horror films, it's the biggest dead horse in Hollywood, and I wish directors and writers would stop that once and for all).

And yet I've got to give this movie credit for a few terrific things, including but not limited to: the realistic presentation of the siblings on a road trip in Florida, the discovery of something very creepy, and what the brother finds underground. These things alone were really done nicely. I wish I had seen this in the movie theater instead of on dvd.",1177286400,3,1294,4.470338983050848

1656189,4,B00005RHGK,"""Jeepers Creepers"" is a fairly stupid name for a horror movie. It certainly didn't inspire confidence in me that this would be anything but another lame teenager based slasher flick. As it turns out, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is much better than it sounds, and while it falls a bit short of classic status, is certainly not to be underestimated.

Darry and Trish Jenner are traveling home for spring break when they are violently harassed by a seemingly psychotic truck driver. Soon after they witness the same driver dumping what appear to be bodies wrapped in sheets into a drainpipe. From this point on, the siblings are torn between helping the victims and escaping this malevolent madman intent on tracking them down. To make matters even worse, it soon becomes apparent that their attacker is far from human.

I'll start with the positives here. The first half an hour of this movie is sensational! If it had managed to keep the standard set in this early period for the entire running time, it would indeed be a fine horror movie. Darry and Trish have fabulous, believable brother and sister chemistry. Their acting may not be award quality, but it's far above typical horror genre fare. When the terror starts, and it starts within the first few minutes, the viewer already has a connection with these characters and that's a credit to the actors and the direction of Victor Salva. These first scenes are seriously intense and I love it. To continue with the positives, the creature itself (The Creeper) looks fantastic. They really created a horrific and fascinating being. Without giving too much away, the filmmakers slowly reveal more and more features of The Creeper as the movie goes on. By the end of the film, you can see him in all his glory and it's a quite a site to behold.

So why don't I consider this to be a classic? Basically, it goes downhill in the second half of the film. I've always been opposed to the use of psychics to tell a story and ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a classic case. With no easy way to tell the audience of the monster's history, nor his reasons for killing, the writers created a psychic woman that for reasons completely unexplained, has a complete knowledge of not only The Creeper but can also see into the future. I admit, it's not done terribly, but it does annoy me. Secondly, ""Jeepers Creepers"" can't quite decide whether it takes itself seriously or not. In my opinion, the first half worked so well due to its intensity and the seriousness of the scenario. Once it starts making self-referential gags and The Creeper starts whistling the Jeepers Creepers tune, I feel it loses that intensity. There seems to be quite a market at the moment for movies that mix comedy with horror. I just feel this wasn't the movie to do it.

Do the positives outweigh the negatives? Yeah, I think so. I really enjoy the movie as a whole and recommend it to any fan of creature features and horror in general. The sequel also has some merit and I hope we see more of The Creeper in years to come.",1170892800,,3022,4.632462686567164

1656191,2,B00005RHGK,"Lets pretend for a second that it's perfectly normal to write two reviews based on one movie:Heres the first

Jeepers Creepers is one of the most painstakngly tension filled and nerve fraying experiences ive had watching a movie in a long time.

And now the second:

Jeepers Creepers is a steaming pile of crap whose biggest asparation is to be ranked among other tepid monster/slasher(is that redundant) flicks that should be lucky to get more than one pass but who somehow will inevitably land a sequal.

Why two reviews? Because it is two movies ad just for that reason is one of the most frustrating experiences Ive had watching anything.

The basic plot is this:A brother and sister on a cross country trip happen upon a site covered(literally) with bodies and find themselves stalked by what seems to be the man responsible.he turns out to be something completly different. This unfortunatly, is the exact place the movie turns into something completly different too. In the first half, the movie builds slowly, the siblings relatonship is portrayed realistically as they are shown bickering about just about everything but through it all show genuine care for each other. The tension starts to build when thy come upon the lair of the creature. Of course at this point they have no way of knowing this terrifying spectacle is not man-made. Inside they find bodies lining the walls, looking eerily laminated. Then they are discovered and a car chase begins as they are being followed by a faceless man driving a black pickup truckin in a sequence that plays out alot like the classic movie Duel. All this works terrifically with mounting tension and shock after shock. I genuinly felt and was afraid for the characters. At this point I was so excited to see how this thing worked itself out I couldn't stand it. i also couldn't stand what the movie descended into after that.

Any horror movie that plays on the type of fears the first half of this movie does should know that not only is less more, but that oftentimes the unknown is more terrifying than anything a movie can produce. Especially if after all that buildup, the reveal turns out to be Bat-boy. After that great beginning, the movie disintegrates into schlock jump scare horror with no sense of fun and having answered the question of what the stranger is, the only thing that gave me a case of the willies was realizing it wasn't going to get any better. I did appreciate the ending, at least they had the cajones to end the movie in a way i wasn't expecting, if thy had just had the cajones to give a second half that could live up to the first.",1168646400,2,2618,4.668112798264642
1656192,1,B00005RHGK,"And the award, for the worst horror movie of all time goes to...""Jeepers Creepers"" OK, I wasn't expecting much when I saw this film, but I didn't expect to watch something that made absolutly no sense. If you like movies with no plots or character development, espically about the lead character then Jeepers Creepers is right up your alley. The movie actually starts off very cool. A brother and sister are on a highway out in the middle of no where, when some maniac tries to run them off the road. They come across this maniac a few minutes later stuffing a body down a sewer pipe, and then they decide to go and check out the scene. What awaits at the bottom of the pipe is creepy indeed, and I thought that this was going to be one hell of a movie. But I was tricked and fooled, because in the next hour, the movie goes from looking like its going to be a sick and twisted thriller to a laughing stock. IF you have seen the movie, read ahead, as they are SPOILERS listed below. IF you haven't seen the movie, read anyway, so you can save yourself an hour and a half of your life doing something more productive, like watching the grass grow. Here is a list of what is completely wrong with this movie.

1. When the teens reach the diner, they get a strange call from a women who knows both their names. It is later reveled that this women is a pyschic who can predict the future through her dreams. She explains that the teens will be at a house later full of cats, and when they here the songs ""Jeepers Creepers"" to watch out. OK, this is completly stupid. If the women wanted to warn the teens they were in trouble, she should have explained who she was (which she never revels on the phone) and told them they were in great danger and to get out of town. Case closed.

2. When the killer is finally reveled he looks he a stupid demon with wings. He looks like the goblin from Spider Man....Ughhh

3. When the women (the pyschic) finally reaches the teen at the police station, she revels who she is, what she sees, and a brief, story, that makes no sense of who this demon is. This is what really kills the movie since we really have no idea of who the demon is and what is his motives about why he kills are. Instead we get some garbage story about how he feeds on humans to stay alive. Sounds like a vampire to me.

4. THE ENDING SUCKS...The demon is in his sewer pipe listening to Jeepers Creepers and there is one of the teens (the guy) standing there with it seems like the life is sucked out of him. It looks like a cardboard cut out with the eye missing and then the demon pears through the eye, and fade to black, movie over. I am sitting here puzzled as I just watched a movie that gave me nothing about the identity of the killer, expect it likes to feed on humans..Wonderful. I have seen low budget B-Horror movie that were better then this, and yes I mean slasher films that have more plot then this. Avoid this movie. You aren't missing anything here. If the writer wanted to make a movie that was confusing and had intentions of making you use your head about what the demon really was, then he needed a much more polished script, that give you a sense of what really could be happening. It just never happens.",1168646400,,3232,4.241883116883117

1656195,4,B00005RHGK,"Trish and Darry Jenner are brother and sister coming back home via the back roads for the holiday break. Their journey is uneventful until they are terrorised by 'some jerk' in a beat up old truck - an event they get over until they later see the driver unloading what looks like bodies into a hole as they drive past. Escaping the ensuing chase, Darry insists they go back to see what he was doing - something he deeply regrets doing when he finds mutilated and preserved bodies all over the inside of the pit. They escape the truck again but their attempts to get help lead to nothing and they find themselves battling much more than the psycho driver that they first feared.

This film was overly praised on its release because it was refreshingly free of the self-awareness and irony that many modern horrors had been full of since Scream. For my money though, the lack of irony didn't mean it would be a good horror movie and, not being good with the scary stuff at the best of times I decided to give it a miss. When it came on TV, I decided to give it a go even though I'm not really a fan of the teen horror genre. However this film is actually a lot better than the normal teen horrors because, like the critics said, it isn't full of the usual clichs and so on. Instead the plot is a pretty tense and simple affair where we are only given two teens rather than a group that will slowly be picked off. The film is not terrifying but it is pretty creepy and has a good, consistent tone to it that is quite unnerving.

The strength of the film is that it doesn't lose momentum when the creature is revealed; usually modern creature features lose a lot of their tension when the (usually CGI) beast is fully seen. Here we have several stages (truck/shadow/man/creepy man/beast) and they all are effective. Salva directs well and injects a good sense of tension into the film but he also knows how to frame a shot - his use of darkness and the tunnel spotlight effect both being pretty effective. Of course it is still just a horror movie and is not perfect but I must admit that I was drawn into it easily early on, even if it did tend to flag a bit as it progresses.

Even though it is not strictly a teen horror, we still have to put up with two rather annoying teenagers in the lead role but I suppose that is to be expected from Salva - according to the courts he has worked with minors before! In fairness to both the actors in the lead roles, they do pretty well, managing to come across real when required (as opposed to fodder filler) but also seeming genuinely afraid. Both Phillips and Long were better than I expected and did well acting as the core of the film. The creature itself is also a good presence even if it does lose a little bit of its creepiness when the wings come out.

Overall this was a surprisingly enjoyable horror movie but of course it is still a teen horror of sorts so don't assume that it will be perfect - it still does pretty much what you expect it to. Like the critics though, I enjoyed its lack of knowing cynicism and it did have a good sense of pace and tension even if it wasn't really 'horrifying'. Still a teen horror then, but one that is better than the norm and worth seeing if you like the genre.",1161043200,14,3251,4.2727272727272725
1656206,2,B00005RHGK,"This was a train wreck. If I hadn't recognized Justin's face from Dodgeball (ugh, another train wreck), I wouldn't have stopped clicking through the channels. When I saw him, I was interested in how he acted. Dodgeball was all I had seen him in, and I thought he was one of the better aspects of the movie. I hadn't been following his career, so seeing him in this film was new to me.

What intrigued me was the polarity of characters that Justin portrayed. One was a terrified teenager, running from your typical Freddy, Jason, Michael, etc. Seriously - there was absolutely nothing unique or interesting in the ""bad guy"" in this film. Who was he/she, and why did the delightful song ""Jeepers Creepers"" mean anything to him/her? Are you hard pressed to come up with a logical answer? Me too. This would have been better if the killer had popped out of a lake, or a meteor. Better yet, a cactus. That would have taken some intellect and creativity to resolve.

In Dodgeball, Justin was simply running scared because he was absolutely unathletic and didn't have a prayer in that silly game they played. (My opinion of the movie itself, for what it's worth, is, well, it was abysmall. Dogeball was rank. That said, the ""gaffer"" on that film probably made more in one month than I make in a year. Jerk.) Still, Justin made his character believable in Dodgeball, and honestly saved the film for me (although in such a tiny, minute fashion).

In Jeepers Creepers here he did the same, but to a greater extent. I never thought I'd tie two characters of such wildly divergent (B) movies together and say they did an excellent job, but I have to break rank here.

The female lead in ""Jeepers Creepers"", Gina Phillips was an extreme bore. This is unusual in boy/girl horror films. It's usually a given that the girl is favored. Not so here, and that says quite a bit about Justin's abilities. He's only 28, so he has quite a while to catch on to something huge. I hope he does. At the time of the filming of ""Jeepers Creepers"" he was about 22. Success awaits. (And, lucky guy, he looks far younger than his years account for.)

Regarding the film - my lord, this was awful. How did it spawn (or spam) a sequel?? This movie was so lame I can't imagine it making any money on a sequel. Yet the sequel did better with Video Rentals than the original, so all in all it made more money. I've yet to see the sequel, but now am very interested in seeing it.

Coming back to the movie at hand...

I've read reviews where the reviewer has said that the ""villain"" was fully realized. I just have to add to this to that...""What?"" Were they high? Seriously, the villain in this film was one of the absolute worst I've seen in any horror film. He had no genesis, no modus operandi - in short, he was simply some devilish form that really liked to kill teenagers. Let's all say it togather... ""DUH""

There isn't much more to say. The movie was no good, but somehow made enough to spawn a sequel. (Blech.) I have a sinking feeling that the original lead actress contracted walking pneumonia and that her understudy played her role. Well, I *had* that ""sinking feeling"" until I just now when I looked her up on imdb.pro. I was happy to see that Justin has fared better than she has, which makes my semi-prediciton correct. Or, at best, it makes me that much more of a snot. Take your pick.

Being a snot is a bad thing. <grin>",1159488000,,3401,4.4375

Come on, a monster that no one can kill, has 23 days to eat whatever organs or body parts that you have that it wants?

I have to admit that the scene down that pipe was pretty cool. It had a lot of potential, and it reminded me of the catacombs and that one church that was on the history channel that was lined with skulls and bones.

Like its sequel, it's the kind of movie that starts off extremely strong and compelling, and doesn't lag for a single second, right through the end credits.  What it starts out with is a brother and sister driving across the prairielands on a crosscountry trip home during a college break, when they encounter something dark, sinister, and dangerous, but which they're left compelled to investigate because of the simple fear that others may be in deep danger if they don't.  What they encounter is the Creeper, and his lair; and one of the most inventive and flat-out awesome of all horror mythologies to ever spring out fully formed upon the screen.

1656210,4,B00005RHGK,"I found this VHS at a thrift store for a dollar and added it to my collection.  I had never seen it before and I must admit I was surprised that a post-2000 movie could deliver such chills.

The most chilling moments were in the first half of the film.  Our two main characters, a brother and sister driving home from spring break along a desolate stretch of country roads somewhere in central Florida, are chased off the road by a maniac in a horrible old truck.  Seemingly a salute to ""Duel"", the director here really outdid Steven Spielberg in casting the ugliest, most horrifying old truck in existence!  If all we ever see in this movie is the truck it would be scary enough!  They later pass an abandoned old church along the roadside where the same old truck is parked and see the driver tossing what looks like wrapped bodies down an old pipe.  The art of the filmmaker is exquisite here.  The driver, clad in a long tattered overcoat and hat, turns and stares at them as they pass.  The scene takes place in broad daylight and yet is one of the most chilling and creepy movie moments I have ever seen.  He gets back in the truck and pursues the teenagers and the story goes on from there.

Only the southern values of the kids could dictate going back to help someone they believe is in trouble, and our characters do just that.  What they discover in the basement of the old church is more frightening than they had first suspected.  The movie loses some momentum from this point on.

The actors give good, competent performances and the location shooting in rural Florida lends a frightening sense of isolation.  Eileen Brennan is good as the crazy old backwoods cat lady.  It is an entertaining movie I don't regret owning.  Victor Salva is a talented campfire storyteller and this movie will probably be his masterpiece.

From main characters acting stupid and stubborn when wisdom says otherwise, to procrasting when you should be running away for help, to making bad decisions at every turn.  This was just a very pathetic way to string together what you would normally call a plot.

The story itself was pretty decent and the main actors gave a nice perfomance too.  If the script had been written by someone who actually had a triple digit IQ, it might have been entertaining.  There were just too many illogical or unreasonable elements that made this movie seem so dumb, for a lack of better word.  On top of these elements, the flow of the movie was also too simplistic.  Not only did they give away the ending halfway through the movie, you can basically call out what would happen next, two-thirds of the time.

My little brother watched it, walked out, and a cat crossed his path.  As he tried to call my mother to tell her about that, his cell phone died.  The church from the scene with the bodies really DID burn down in real life, not too long after the movie was made.  And of course, they had no control over those crows.

1656241,5,B00005RHGK,"Man, talk about bad timing!

Let's say you're happy-go-lucky college kids heading home for college break: brother Darius (Justin Long), sis Trish (Gina Philips), two kids motoring it across those lonely, barren stretches of miles and miles of---well, miles and miles.

You'd think that in America these days, we've digitally connected and sewn up every last b*stard inch of the Great Lonely Howling Spaces, that we've blasted microfiger and digital optic networks and cable stations with five-thousand channels into the back of beyond: that there really is no wild stretch of highway where the normal laws and conventions of society hold sway.

Oh, but there is. Go on a road trip: look at all those lonely diners marooned along vast, forsaken strips of blacktop. Take one of those empty little roads to nowhere, three turns away from the Interstate: go bumpity-bump down a dusty trail to a gas-n'-go that closes shop on Sunday because---well, there's just no business in these parts on Sunday, Old Hoss.

Flip the radio on right about now: chances are you're going to get a load of Jesus. Come to the Lord! Hell awaits! Satan stalking the Earth, hungry as a lion, seeking those who He can devour, Hallelujah!

Thousands of Americans disappear every year, in our great interconnected Republic: it's true, many run away, change their names, disappear, start new lives.

But it's also true, I think, that many of them set out on road trips, and get eaten alive.

So you're Darius and Trish, and you have the worst timing ever. Because, see, on this particular stretch of blacktop, you've got this Thing. A Troll, let's say: an Ogre, the Boogeyman, a Monster. Every twenty-three years it awakens: for 23 days, it gets to Eat. And by Jesus, it sure is hungry!

Timing is everything.

Now: director Victor Salva is a real sicky: I'm going to avoid into the man's history of pedophilia---though I do think his peculiar obsessions very much inform his deeply personal vision of horror, and---at least from a cinematic standpoint---in a good way. The Creeper doesn't just stalk Darius---he has a lark sniffing his undies!

But look: the true ghoulish glory of ""Jeepers Creepers"" lies in its simplicity: you're on the road, you're tired, you're hungry, you want to sleep. Without meaning to, you see a dark, hulking figure---all inky shadows in its duster and broad-brimmed hat---dumping what appear to be bodies down a corrugated pipe, into God knows where.

It sees you.

And oh God, though you wish it weren't so---though you later wish desperately you hadn't seen *it*---it comes hunting for you.

It's outside your window right now. Looking in.

That's the guts and bloody viscera of ""Jeepers Creepers""---forget the goofy psychic lady, forget the gratuitous Eileen Brennan---and focus down on the dark, stark, deeply twisted sickness of this flick about the Boogeyman hot on your trail, looking you up, coming calling to your bedside to give you one of those great parting gifts and---oh yes---a long, sweet kiss in the Dark.

Pucker up.

1656243,4,B00005RHGK,"The idea of traveling on the open road is both inviting and horrifying. On one hand, the road is paved with values that can shape and change your life. On the other more mysterious and deadly hand, the road is filled with the worst thing of all, the unknown. ""Jeepers Creepers"" seems to capture that perfectly. Instead of coming to the unknown a la ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", the unknown comes to them. That's a scary thought...

Justin Long and Gina Phillips as the two protagonists, Darry and Trish, are driving home to see the old family. Along the way, across barren terrain, they are daunted by an unusual, hollowed out truck that almost throws them from the road. It's only later down the road when they see it again, but by then, they're already a part of something much bigger.

""Jeepers Creepers"" is by far one of the better horror films to have come out in the past ten years. There's something original and real in the whole mess. Victor Salva, the director, never tries to be overly stylistic and keeps the film simple. There are dark edges, but never too dark (i.e. Alex Proyas, David Fincher) and the film never sets a certain date, leaving the audience to feel very general about the whole thing. In a way, the film is a bit timeless.

Story wise, Salva creates two great characters. Darry and Trish are perfect examples of young adults in any generation. Not to mention both Philips and Long play them very well with such chemistry too. I like how it's a brother and sister ordeal and not the usual boyfriend and girlfriend motif that's been outdone in horror films, especially for the past twenty years. There's a lot going for it. While I must admit the film's first half is stronger over the latter, it's the ending that makes this film most memorable and actually horrific. Ballsy might be a good word for it.

Between the fluid storyline, the dark visuals, chilling soundtrack (of course, the title track too), ""Jeepers Creepers"" is one of the better modern horror films to have come out in awhile. Just stay far, far away from the sequel...

That's a scary thought in itself.",1130112000,5,2097,4.626344086021505
1656244,4,B00005RHGK,"Basic Plot: When a brother and sister driving along a desolate desert road witness what appears to be a man dumping corpses down a chute in the ground, they attempt to investigate. What they find is a horrific surprise. But even after they flee in terror from the hellish scene, the mysterious man catches up with them. They soon find themselves out in the middle of nowhere with their only company as a few locals and the baffled small-town police. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Before long, they discover the vicious predator isn't even human. And, to put the icing on the dreadful cake, the answers of why it is here and what it wants are revealed!

Few modern-day horror films include original, interesting, and iconic monsters. Well, Jeepers Creepers does! Although a superb cast and talented crew contribute to the greatness, the best part about it is the creature itself. Despite a few scenes (that are actually so realistic you can't tell CGI is used), the monster is the product of a very believeable full-body-suit, not cheap computer tricks. Before the inhuman identity is revealed of The Creeper, it's wardrobe is eye-poppingly awesome. Like the darkest of the darkest superheros, his long trench-coat flaps in the wind and his rugged hat shades his evil face. Like some kind of demon-cowboy, he's intimidating to the characters, yet mesmerizing to the audience. Eventually, of course, the clothing comes off and one hell of a creature is presented. I won't give a description of that -- you've got to see it for yourself. All I can say is that monster fans will not be disappointed!

In short conclusion, this is a great comeback for the old-fashioned creature flicks. It's not very scary, but it's a whole lot of fun! Jeepers Creepers excludes over-the-top gore and sexuality, trading in another cliche storyline for an unforgettable experience of pure monster mayhem.",1123804800,12,1894,4.915625

Great performance from Justin Long, some fantastic camera work and eerie sound effects help to create a solid monster movie and makes for some really tense moments!

The Creeper is a very cool creature, and the arguing brother and sister aren't really a common set of main characters in other movies, so they help with the believibility of the story.  The story pretty much revolves around two siblings trying to get away from a monster guy who drives a really sweet (yet durty and old) truck and tries to eat them.  The whole point is that he likes to scare people and that's why he doesn't kill them at first.  He only is awake for 23 days every 23 years (I own the movie and I'm not for sure on that though).  There are some pretty cool scenes that add a little suspense and some locations that add to the overall creepy (no pun intended) mood of the story.  Victor Salva, who has an interesting past that I won't go into, does not focuse as much on blood and gore as he could, but goes more for suspense and scares, which is cool since we get enough gore in this day and age.  I think horror fans should go for this, but I'm not sure if the casual moviegoer will enjoy this.  They might not understand it's purpose.",1122508800,,1285,4.237704918032787

1656250,3,B00005RHGK,"I personally believe the Horror movie industry began a slow decline in the mid 1980's. It seemed like every possibility had been used up and audiences could not longer be spooked with gory special effects or imaginative use of the cinema camera. Auteurs like Dario Argento, Mario Bava, George Romero and even hacks like Lucio Fulci began to get progressively worse as the 1980's wore on. At this time, American horror movies began the development of ""character"" driven horror movies (since the good guys where all victims, only the baddies could get character development) and this led to serial series including horror stalwarts such as Freddie Krueger, Michael Myers, Jason Voohees as well as lesser knowns like the Tall Man (Phantasm). These serial horror movies (Jason X, Freddie VII, Halloween H20, Puppet Master 15) led to the downfall, because while the series runs out of ideas after the second movie, the movies are continued to be made.

The 1990's brought some interesting ideas. I liked movies like People Under the Stairs (1991), Scream (1996) and others, but the genre has not recovered. In the early 1980's, Jeepers Creepers would not be considered much of an atmospheric movie (compared to movies like ""The Fog"" or ""The keep""), but in a genre in which movies like Jason X and The Haunting exist, Jeeper's Creepers does pretty well.

The movie starts with a brother and sister pair going home for Spring Break. Darry (short for Darius) is the younger brother, who is a goof and easy going. Trish is the older, more cynical sister. As they drive, they play silly road games (like we all used to during long road trips) and pick on each other, however, there is always an air of tension in the air that lingers even in the most lightest moments. It is helped by the fact that the soundtrack is very much in the background, not manipulating the audience.

Terror does appear in the form of an old battered truck that terrorizes the teens. It is an homage to Duel, one of my favorite movies of the 1970's. However, soon we find out the identity of the driver as the kids pass by and see him dropping body bags into a sewer. In a scene that defies all logic, but falls under the ""rules"" that govern horror movies, the two go back and investigate what is happening. What they find is horrifying, but not too original (Salva and his production designer must have seen one Coffin Joe movie too much).

The being catches their scent and begins tracking them down and the movies turns into a cat and mouse game, with the protagonists frantically running and the antagonist turning into the indistructible shape. While the movie begins to term generic and the baddies turns into another Freddie like character, the ending was great and does provide a slight twist.

Victor Salva, who was notorious as being the ""child molester"" director has directed two movies that I have seen. Clownhouse is a low budget movie that was fairly well done, but his first big budget movie ""Powder"" was simply horrible. With Jeepers Creepers he starts out well, but as the story develops, the audience learns too much of the creature and it begins to lose it's mystique (One of the reason why the movie Duel was so great was because we never understand the motives of the crazy trucker). At the end we find out he's just another movie monster, another demon that has no appeal because the only thing that makes it interesting is taken away from it.

The brother and sister duo do better. They are believable as siblings and do what they can with the simplistic script. However, they are not given a chance to progress their relationship past the setup phase so when one of the siblings are taken away from the other, we don't feel the great sense of loss that we should.

Overall, this movie is good in a genre that has consistently given us crap over the past 15 years. But, this movie is in no way going to be a classic.....Rating: C+

The DVD has several featuers, but it is not full of them. The minimalistic soundtrack gets creepy at the right momemts and has decent (but not great) dynamic punch. The transfer is average...DVD features rating is C.",1120694400,,4138,4.674450549450549

If not the best nor my favorite horror-movie I find it amongst the better ones (it is original as a big plus) -this being said; hm, let's be honest here, most horror-movies (I repeat; Most!) contain some lack of intelligence and fantasy to make the ""utilmate complete story"", and scores instead on style and special-effects, it seldom depends too much on the acting, what matters are the fit locations and the sound-effects play a big part too.

There are exeptions of course; We have masterpieces like the classic ""The Excorsist"" and ""The Omen"" (and many more), and also the more recent ""The Sixth Sence"" and ""The Others"". Fantastic!

""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" are perhaps even creepier than them all, but let's face it; Not much story behind the effective camera-work and sound-effects that make the viewers sit tightened to their seats biting their fingernails off. Some stories have more to tell than others.

The best part of ""Jeepers Creepers"" is the car, that alone looks scary (""Who drives something looking as mean as that!""). Bravo!

I thought the first half like many others is the best part, but the second part is anything but boring. Predictable perhaps, not livivng up to its' premise, but indeed entertaining.

3) The physic.

Entertaining and quite different horror thriller that harkons back to the 70's horror movies of it's era, there is some decent acting, fine gore and scares to go with it. The opening sequence is quite terrifying and it's twist ending is definitely disturbing as well, i think it's the one of the better horror offerings in recent memory.

Victor Sava goes through all his thought processes, telling us how he made this movie work.  He describes how he developed the characters, how he conceived the story, how he used lighting and mood in the film and many other fascinating details that make you feel like you're really on the inside of the process.  One of the most interesting parts of his commentary is his description of how he had to fight the studio/producer to keep certain scenes in the movie:  the essential tension being that he wanted to develop the characters so that we would care when something happened to them, and the producer wanted to get to the slashing.  I've watched  lot of these commentaries and they readily devolve into a bunch of anecdotes that, in the end, are not very interesting.  (This is exactly what happened in the commentary to Jeepers Creepers 2, which is a stinkfest of Sava and bunch of young actors telling in-jokes about the production.)  This one really is good, though, it's almost like a mini-film school, or at least one of the better lectures at a mini-film school.  Similarly recommended are the special features included in the special edition DVD of Robert Rodriguez's Desperado/El Mariachi.",1106179200,2,1576,4.803703703703704

1656271,2,B00005RHGK,"Just knowing that there is a sequel to this movie led me to want to see this movie.  After watching it, the reason is obvious.  The first movie answers little to nothing.  If anything, this movie was one big question mark.

Without going into detail of the story, suffice it to say that the main characters, the police, the psychic, and we the viewers have no idea what the creature is.  For horror aficionados, the creature is well done and scary.  Ideas of demons and or animal hybrids may come to mind.  Unfortunately for us, the movie never goes into detail.  The attempt of the creature to appear somewhat human is thrilling.

The main characters are a brother and sister traveling home from college.  Part of their discussion, as well as their trip to begin with, border on urban legend.  The siblings argue back and forth as only siblings can, but these actors do almost too good a job.  Before too long into the movie, I found myself completely siding with one and losing my temper with the other.  (Who hasn't yelled at the TV?)  Although this seems to detract for the story, the emotional response added to the movie experience for me.

Although I haven't seen the next one, I would hope that it answers the questions raised in this one.  Given that, I would recommend not watching this unless you are going to be watching the sequel soon afterwards",1106006400,,1359,4.576763485477178
1656272,1,B00005RHGK,"I love horror movies. I can't get enough of them. For me and this is my opinion, this has to be one of the worst horror flicks in recent years, along with Cabin Fever. My husband and I were left staring at the screen in awe of how bad it was. I seriously felt my brain cells possibly melting away with every minute I watched it.

I try not to write bad reviews, because everyone tastes are so different, but nothing about this movie was great. The acting left much to be desired. The filmed lacked intensity. While the plot wasn't terrible, it could have been been delivered in a much more entertaining way. While it had plenty of gore, it was missing the ""sitting at the edge of your seat"" feeling. Instead of biting my nails, I was scratching my head wondering what the heck were they thinking.

All in all, I was bored out of my mind. I would rather kick back and watch classics like The Thing, Halloween, or Poltergiest. For me The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time. If you want to be freaked out, that one will do it for ya.

I would save your money on this one, and just rent it if you are curious to see it at all. Again, everyone has there taste in horror flicks. Those of my friends and family members who watched this all agree that it would have been better to leave it on the shelf.",1105401600,3,1303,4.183266932270916
1656273,4,B00005RHGK,"I hear an amazing amount of chatter nowadays about the generally poor quality of recent horror film releases. Fans of the genre point to films plagued with cliches, the endless stream of remakes, and just about anything else they find objectionable as evidence that the era of horror is over. I'm not absolving myself here; I do a fair amount of complaining myself from time to time. It's easy to do when you watch something like ""Shatter Dead"" or ""Slash."" If I truly thought these two films represented the future of horror, I would volunteer to shovel the first bit of dirt on the grave myself. Then again, there are people who genuinely like these two movies and wish to see more films like them. Personally, I am getting to the point where I welcome the good with the bad. For one thing, I secretly enjoy watching terrible films. There is something enormously entertaining about trashing a real piece of schlock. Too, I would rather see ANY horror film arriving on the scene than none at all. Think about it: if people quit renting horror, the next wave of fans turned talented directors and producers might never fulfill their destinies. All of this is a rather convoluted way to say the following: ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a pretty good modern horror movie. It's definitely not another ""Shatter Dead"" or ""Slash.""

""Jeepers Creepers"" tells the horrific tale of Trish Jenner (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long). The problems begin when Darry drives his sister home from college. This isn't your normal jaunt across town or through a couple of neighborhoods, but a cross-country excursion that takes several days. Worse, the two have to navigate their way through the flat plains of the Midwest, which, as I can assure you from personal experience, is a daunting expedition. In the true tradition of Hollywood, they can't pick anything up on their radio except some loudmouth preacher bible thumping about the apocalypse. Since the trip takes place during the summer, the heat makes them antsy. The opening sequences of the movie show the two quibbling with each other about personal problems and their parents. Trish also takes Darry to task for straying far from the security of the interstate system in order to take the ""scenic"" route. Needless to say, she's more right than she knows. Things take an ominous turn when a souped up black truck/van hybrid roars up behind them. With horn blazing away, this vehicle repeatedly swerves, bumps into Darry's car, and generally acts like most drivers in my hometown. He runs the two kids off the road but doesn't bother stopping.

Later, when the two happen to cruise by an abandoned church just in time to see the driver of the aforementioned black vehicle dumping what looks like a body wrapped in a bloody sheet down a drainpipe, the trip takes on ominous dimensions. He--at least we think it's a he although it's hard to tell with all those black clothes and a coat on--jumps into his car and comes after them again. Trish and Darry manage to avoid another confrontation but foolishly decide to head over to the church to see what went into the pipe. Down into the ground goes Darry, only to discover an enormous cavern decorated with human wallpaper. It appears that the guy dumping corpses into this pipe has been doing it for eons considering the number of bodies hanging all over the place. Darry manages to get out, reunite with Trish, and hightail it down the road to the nearest diner to make the obligatory call to the cops. But yet another weird incident occurs, this time an out of the blue phone call to the kids on the payphone from a woman claiming to be a psychic. She knows all about what they saw and warns them of extreme danger. What we eventually learn about this guy is that he's no guy at all, but some flying demon awakened from his years long sleep. He's out collecting humans and now he has his sights set on Trish and Darry. Throw in the Cat Lady (Eileen Brennan), a couple of cannon fodder cops, good gore, and you have all the makings for a fun filled horror romp.

The first part of ""Jeepers Creepers"" works better than the second half. The rather calm world of the Jenner kids suddenly shattered by a weirdo in a spooky vehicle out in the middle of nowhere is a terrifying proposition that the film pulls off well. Just as eerie is the glimpse of this black clad figure dumping the corpse in the drainpipe. Although I can't find it anywhere on the web, I swear that the writer got the idea for this scene from an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" where the same situation happened to several travelers somewhere in the United States (minus the flying demon, of course). Once the psychic Jezelle (Patricia Belchar) physically enters the picture, the movie loses some of its steam. By this time Trish and Darry are in a police station facing the prospect of the Creeper running rampant in the building. The resulting scenes of carnage reminded me too much of a similar scene in ""Darkness Falls"" even though ""Jeepers Creepers"" did it first. In short, I think the movie is scarier when we don't know what Trish and Darry are up against.

Still, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is definitely worth watching. For once MGM actually loaded up for bear with the extras. We get a commentary track with director Victor Salva, plenty of deleted scenes, stills, cast and crew filmographies, and a making of featurette. Followed by an intriguing sequel that is in and of itself entertaining although it doesn't quite capture the magic of the first installment, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a prime example of how horror movies can still attain a measure of originality and scares.",1102118400,4,5639,4.721827411167513
1656274,4,B00005RHGK,"I read a lot of bad reviews on this movie and I just have to say it was not as bad as they say. The ending was not as terrible as some think, however the middle part was a little confusing. This said, I really enjoyed watching this movie and the two main characters were very good and believable. The creeper is tremendously cool, however I do think they could have made him a little more gruesome instead of futuristic looking. The first 45 minutes of the movie is wicked scary with the truck that chases them and the part where the see the creeper staring at them after dumping off the bodies in the pipe (probably the scariest image I've ever seen). I haven't seen the sequel, but this movie was really fun to watch and is not as awful as some reviews set it out to be.",1102032000,,772,4.1879194630872485
1656275,3,B00005RHGK,"Two charming siblings, Trish and Darry (Gina Philips and Juston Long) are returning home from college and driving down one of those long, lonesome, country roads (the ones that are so commonplace in horror films). They witness a man throwing bodies down a drainage pipe at the back of an old church and in an act of absolute stupidity, Darry (the dumber of the two), decides to investigate. He soon discover hundreds of perfectly preserved *dead* bodies all stitched up and artistically spread out throughout a dusty, dark cellar. His nosiness fuels the wrath of the killer who isn't a man at all but some sort of monstrous, murderous demon who has risen from the depths of the earth to feed on human flesh.

I must frankly state that it was very difficult for me to feel sorry for the two main characters. Although they were both youthful, attractive and somewhat likable, it was their foolishness that got them in trouble in the first place. I am no expert in profiling but the film still begs me to ask the question: What part of the man's appearance/demeanor had they not mistaken for a vicious killer? He was only about 10 feet tall, was wearing a freakish, dusty, moth worn hat, a Jack The Ripper-ish over coat and was clearly dumping bodies (most likely dead bodies) into a drainage pipe. And let's not forget his mode of transportation and really bad driving skills.

With that said, at the time of its release in 2001, ""Jeepers Creepers"", directed by the controversial and notorious Victor Salva, was one of the more original horror films. It has good performances by its young cast, some built up tension and a very mysterious killer. Although the film follows the typical slasher movie formula, it rises above most due to its enigmatic and supernatural storyline. The origins of the killer is never really explained and its face is not clearly shown until the final frames adding a sense of mystery and intrigue. When the monster is finally revealed, up close and personal, it is quite the beauty, possessing a face that any reader of ""Fangoria"" would love to pin up on their bedroom wall. Also add in to the mix some peculiar characters - the psychic and mysterious cat lady come to mind, some scenes of gore (not over-done), slaughter, and a surprise ending and you have an enjoyable, eerie tale of human idiocy, bloodshed and tears. Oh and who can forget that song?

1656276,5,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers is a superior monster movie and necessary viewing for Horror junkies.  A seemingly unstoppable beast that waits 23 years for 23 days of human munching gluttony. What really works with this film is the abundance of implications of greater evil, in particular the ""larder"" scene.  The onscreen body count is relatively low but the creep factor is high because as humans we like being at the top of the food chain.

The Creeper is one heck of an interesting beast, a winged humanoid fond of dusters and wide brimmed hats that drives the scariest on screen vehicle since Duel.  He makes his own weapons and can track you down by the scent of your fear.  One more thing, he's got his own theme song.

""I don't know if it's a demon or a devil, or just some hungry thing from some dark place in time.""

There is some gore and carnage in this film but nothing over the top, playing more to our fears of helplessness and the unknown.

""Whatever it eats becomes a part of it.""

Any movie that messes with my primal fears of being something's lunch and pitted against an unstoppable foe is going to get high marks in my book.  Jeepers Creepers does that incredibly well and therefore I can't recommend it enough.  I just wish more studios made movies like this.

1656297,5,B00005RHGK,"I saw Jeepers Creepers in the theaters on the date of its original theatrical release.  Considering that audiences have been dealing with Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and other slash flicks, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Needless to say, I was blown away.  The music that was played during the surprisingly brief opening credits creeped me out early on, and I remained horrified throughout the remainder of the film.  It opens with siblings Trishia and Darry driving home through the country for their Spring Break.  I won't get too much into details as not to ruin this for anyone who has yet to see this film(anyone?).  However, this movie succeeds on so many levels.  No, the murderer is not your mere Michael Myers, or Jason Vorhees... he's the ""man"" right out of your darkest nightmare.  He sticks to the shadows throughout the film, and when he is revealed he only becomes even more terrifying.  Another high point of Jeepers Creepers is the well developed bond between Trishia and Darry.  These characters aren't paper, they're real people who viewers should be able to get behind.  And it's very easy to see the movies through their shoes, and to feel their fear.  The conclusion is the best I've seen in a horror film, and I certainly left the theater in shock... and didn't sleep until 4 in the morning.  The DVD extras are excellent.

1656298,2,B00005RHGK,"Why rehash the plot when you've probably read the editorial reviews and many user reviews? I'll just tell you what I liked/disliked about ""Jeepers Creepers,"" give you a conclusion and let you make up your own mind.

The Good: The first 30-45 minutes or so of ""Jeepers Creepers"" are excellent. Unlike many horror film directors, Salva has the restraint to slowly build a truly creepy atmosphere and introduces characters -- siblings Trish and Darry -- who are even more stupid than your average horror protagonists but at least come across as actual human beings and not just cannon fodder. Even when they did something stupid (about every 10 minutes by my count) I found myself rooting for them. Salva's direction is also very stylish, from the initial haunting shot of a car slowly, silently coming toward the camera from a deserted mid-West all the way through the well-choreographed action scenes. And finally, the art direction is very interesting. The style of car the protagonists drive and the desolate country settings add up to a sort of retro-50s, drive-in movie look that I liked.

The Bad: Wow, does this movie fall apart fast. After spending nearly an hour showing remarkable restraint, introducing characters that we like and building a sense of dread in the audience, ""Jeepers Creepers"" spills all of its secrets and completely ruins what could've been one of the best horror films I've seen in years. What made the Creeper so frightening in the first part of the movie is that the audience doesn't know what the protagonists are up against. Once Salva reveals his (admittedly good-looking) creature from the black lagoon ripoff, ""Jeepers Creepers"" descends into incoherent self-parody and isn't frightening in the least.

One particularly stupid move was to stick a psychic into the picture about midway in one of the most hamhanded information dumps I've ever seen. Here's a tip for all screenwriters: Never include a psychic in your movie if 1) He/she doesn't actually clarify anything, anyway and 2) the character has no effect whatsoever on the plot. Just plain stupid.

Overall I'd like to give the movie 3 or more stars, just on direction and atmosphere alone. Salva obviously knows how to frame a shot and the beginning of the picture is excellent. But the script and the second half of the movie is so totally inept that I can't justify more than two stars; watching what could've been a great movie unravel was truly disappointing.",1098316800,,2456,4.953883495145631

The opening scene with Trish and Derry bantering back and forth on their drive home  is a masterful one.  What seems to be a comical engagement between a teen brother and sister takes on a sinsiter backdrop  when that vacation camper pulls off the highway and clears the path for the star of the show. What at first is a tiny blur on the back screen quickly looms to reveal a real terror. The whole scene has a Hitchcock feel to it as it sets the stage for the events that follow.  The revelation of the demon and the horrors he brings with him is gradual and the visions of him are not overdone.  He earns his reputation as the ""Creeper"".  There are excellent stunts in this film, as the demon shows up in dark and eerily lit places.  The scenes are atmospheric, memorable and fun to watch.

That was the filmmakers' surprise. but i don't think that was the right appraoch. After being creeped out for half the movie, it is just a terrible dissapointment to see the monsters face, and it will ruin the rest of the movie.

I found The Creeper much more effective early in the movie when it was just him in his hat and rags, driving his truck. Once he was fully revealed he lost a lot of his menace. The psychic angle was okay to get some back-story into the movie, however she kept telling the kids ""you don't understand,"" but refused to explain. You're right, I don't understand - and while I may fear what I don't understand in other circumstances, here I just got annoyed.
So much of the movie is a mixture of other films that I got frustrated trying to follow it toward the end. Think of it as Duel meets The Birds meets Urban Legend meets The Hitcher meets Silence of the Lambs meets Mimic meets who-knows-what-else.
The movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as: ""What is The Creeper?"" ""Where did it come from?"" ""Why is Trish willing to sacrifice herself for Darry? (Does it have anything to do with Mr. Poly-Sci-Track-Team Guy?)"" and ""Are Jezelle's dreams ever wrong?""
The movie does have some redeeming qualities, though. The actors do a good job with their roles; Eileen Brennan gives a delightfully off-center performance as The Cat Lady. The music is effective. There are some good gross-out moments and some good suspense. Unfortunately, the movie is less than the sum of its parts, a disappointing muddle.

Jeepers Creepers (2001) is a fun, interesting, stylistic film that runs out of gas about halfway through, but still had enough going for it to earn critical and commercial success, spawning a sequel, Jeepers Creepers II (2003) which broke Labor Day box office records for that year.  Written and directed by the controversial Victor Salva, who also did the chilling horror film Clownhouse (1988) and Powder (1995), Jeepers Creepers brings to life (or death) a new figure in the Hollywood creature pantheon with the Creeper, a demonic looking figure that awakens every 23 years and feeds for 23 days, according to legend.

The film stars Gina Phillips as Trish and Justin Long as her brother Derry, traveling together by car a lonely and desolate country highway on their way home from college.  After a scary incident with an old truck, the two witness a sinister, cloaked figure unceremoniously dumping what appears to body sized parcels wrapped in cloth and rope down a large, corrugated metal pipe next to a boarded up church.  Also parked nearby is the same truck that nearly ran them off the road earlier.  Once past the old church, the two begin to question what exactly they saw, but are soon joined again by the mysterious truck, more intent than ever now to ram their car, and drive them off the road.  After losing the truck, the two go back to the church, despite Trish's protests, to investigate.  Derry proceeds to do something stupid, and see something no human was mean to see...oh, he did confirm what they originally thought, that the figure was indeed dumping bodies down this large drain, but that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.  What other secrets are uncovered?  What is the nature of the creature?  Do Trish and Derry survive long enough to get help?

I thought the makeup and such on the Creeper looked quite good and suitably malevolent.  And the revelations revealed about this character came at a nice, even clip as the plot unfolded.  There were a number of minor points where one could argue that the plot is weak or very thin, and I would have a hard time disagreeing, especially during the last half hour of the film.  I really enjoyed the scenes that focused on something in the foreground, but provided enough leeway on the screen to see something in the background, even if it was fuzzy and out of focus, before the characters on the screen understood what was happening.  Cheap scares are had here, as things pop out `and go boo!' but there is also a nice build up of real tension throughout the film, along with a smattering of comedy, usually of the sarcastic kind, to temper the horror.  The weakness of the film comes from the predictability of the second half of the film.  The original beginning had brought forth high hopes, but these hopes diminished slightly as the film eventually tread the path repetition as most end up doing, but at least this one did so with style and professionalism most uncommon with those in the same genre.  You may recognize Justin Long from TV's Ed were he plays Warren Parker Cheswick.  It's pretty much the same affable character played in this film, but a little bit older and a little more cynical.  Gina Philips is quite lovely, with her flowing, brownish hair and doe eyed appearance that conflicts with her more cynical than her brother attitude.  Both actors did a wonderful job, showing a mixture of inherent and hard earned talent, the kind gained through lots of work and dedication.

The picture here, available in both wide screen and full screen, looks wonderful and crisp.  Special features include theatrical trailers, a photo gallery, deleted, extended, and alternate scenes, behind the scenes featurettes (six), and a commentary track with director Victor Salva.  Many of these features are located on the flip side of the disc, with the film being on the other side.  I guess the one thing I took away from this film more than anything else is if you see a darkened figure dumping what appears to be bodies down a sewer pipe next to an abandoned church, just keep on moving.  You can make a report at the next town, for sure, but avoid actually crawling into the pipe to confirm what you already know.

1656326,5,B00005RHGK,"Trish (Gina Phillips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are on their way home from school in Trish's old car. On a long, lonely stretch of highway, they encounter a maniac driving a souped up truck that's as fast as a rocket-sled! Said maniac keeps crashing into the rear of their car and zooms off around them and into the distance. While still recovering from this experience, Trish and Darry see this guy, loading what appear to be bodies, down a pipe by an old abandoned church. Of course, they simply MUST investigate or there wouldn't be much of a movie now would there? So, when the big guy leaves, they go to the pipe, and Darry  crawls into it! In the darkness below, he discovers a subterranean nightmare of death! This is no ordinary stalker / slasher story after all. Darry, now in shock, staggers up and out through the church and Trish drives them to a diner to call the police. It just gets creepier from there. The cops arrive, adding a sense of false security. Things are about to spin wildly out of control for everyone concerned, once The Creeper makes ""his"" intentions known. The Creeper is one of the better movie monsters I've seen in years. He'll definitely stick in your head! JEEPERS CREEPERS is a grand combination of familiar horror / thriller elements. The beginning is a lot like Spielberg's ""Duel"" in it's relentless chase between car and truck. The unveiling of the creeper's cathedral of death reminded me of the discovery of the queen's egg-chamber in ""Aliens"" or the living-room scene in the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", shocking and disturbing. Also, there's a scene at the police station that reminded me of Arnold's infamous ""I'll be Back!"" sequence in ""The Terminator"". JEEPERS CREEPERS is one of the best horror movies I've seen in quite a while. Great acting, eerie situations, a scary monster, and a continual sense of dread should be enough for any fan of the genre...",1079395200,,1919,4.745508982035928

1656339,5,B00005RHGK,"I have seen some scary movies in my time, but this one is even better than the first one! The cinematography is the key, which is why even in broad daylight, the very thought of the Creeper being nearby can still titillate the senses! He's here, then he's gone; he can fly, and that is the one flaw in the movie: with speed and stealth like that, where does the concept of ""Creeper"" come in?
The kids are on their way home from a game. Of course, the bus is integrated, but hints of homophobia filter in and out of the teasing and bullying that takes place. But that doesn't last long, as a crisis brings together this most divergent of groups: a flat tire is just the beginning of the nightmares these high schoolers are about to experience, and as each chaperone disappears, the kids are left to what little wits they've got to try to make something good out of an ultra-bad situation!
Without giving it away, let me add that the ending is anti-climatic -- which paves the way for a ""Jeepers Creepers 3."" Congrats on the unique story line, a combination of Disney's ""The SCarecrow of Romney Marsh"" and ""Nightmare on ELm Street."" A must see!",1078099200,2,1142,4.442857142857143
1656340,4,B00005RHGK,"Stylish, scary horror film that is one of the most creative and original to come around in years. It's good old-fashioned horror at it's best, with a hip cast and returning director Victor Salva.
Whilst Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are driving back from college for summer break, they are run off the road by a monstrous and ugly, beat-up truck with the license plate ""BEATINGU."" Later on, they see the same truck again by an old church and realize that the driver is shoving a body down a dark pipe. When the siblings go back to investigate and try to help, what they find is beyond their wildest nightmares...and actually apart of a local psychic who knows what is going to happen next to the brother and sister.
The only complaint I have about this film is the fact that the ending becomes very silly, and the way the creature becomes naked looks very computerish and spoils the old-fashioned feel of the film which is part of what made it so frightening. However, the VERY end is quite creepy and as I've already said, this is one of the best horror films to come around in years. Enjoy.",1077321600,2,1119,4.517241379310345

So is when they were escaping and they were at the house with the lady with all the cats. There was little action and the pyshic was really stupid. Were we supposed to be scared when she was singing. This movie was also really sick at points too. When the lady at the gas station says ""He was sniffing all your clothes and it looked like he was enjoying it too"" was nasty and did we have to see him ripping the toungue out of that guy. I wanted to see the cops shoot him so bad. I don't think they should've put all the sick scenes in without putting a stronger plot. The whole movie was really a conversation between Darry and his sister with ten minutes of them running away. This movie was not worthy of a sequel and it was trying to be a Halloween movie or a Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff.

1656342,4,B00005RHGK,"'Jeepers Creepers' is a strange thing - for the most part, it's a genuinely impressive and extremely well-crafted horror movie, with shades of the true greats of the genre like the original  'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Friday the Thirteenth', but then it goes and lets itself down with a predictable, tensionless ending.
'Jeepers Creepers' follows the story of brother and sister pair Trish and Darry Jenner (Gina Phillips and Justin Long) as they make the long road trip home from college for the holidays. Along the way they have a nasty altercation with a large black truck, and that starts a chain of devastating events with a highway murderer, out for their blood and refusing to let go.
On so, so many levels this movie works better than most other contemporary horror movies. Hithero-unknown actors Phillips and Long prove themselves to be excellent actors, creating genuinely tense atmosphere and credible emotion in their roles. Direction, too, is excellent, with the hazy, summertime country highway vistas contrasing violently and to great effect with the chaos and noise of the Creeper and his truck. The images of the Murderer as a tall, all-in-black stranger work so very well - he's a genuinely scary character, an imposing figure straight out of a nightmare. The sense of isolation and tension created by director Victor Salva are strong, and give this movie the bulk of its strength.
Shame, then, that the ending is effectively ruined by a predictable, unscary cliche involving the supernatural and a fat psychic. 'Jeepers Creepers' goes from sublime to ridiculous with action-movie style scenes and when the bad guy is finally unmasked, we can;t help but feel so disappointed.
If you can overlook this fact, though, (and to be fair, the bad guy is visible in the rather good sequel from the get-go, not spoiling anything) 'Jeepers Creepers' is an excellent horror movie, and really one for any horror buff's collection.",1075507200,,1944,5.05607476635514

This is NOT a revisitation of any kind of vintage horror..... it's a company taking a shot in the dark.  This one seems to want to borrow the ""rural legend"" theme from Pumpkinhead. The end product is nowhere near as well put together. Flavor of the week horror flicks CAN be good, suspension of disbelief included..... it's just that this one doesn't even seem to make an effort to convince (I mean c'mon, the only reason the curious guy gets his eyes eaten is because he thinks one of those ""dead bodies"" the demon is dropping down the pipe might be alive, for some stupid reason) the viewer at all. Mind you, the idea of a creature that regenerates itself by consuming the parts of its victims would be rather scary if implemented in say, a sci-fi horror movie, in this it just doesn't work. Add the fact that this movie got an even higher budget sequel is proof that God hates us all. If you want a good chill, go rent any of the movies mentioned above.

1656346,3,B00005RHGK,"Let me tell you folks, this is the most difficult review I've ever written.  Why?  Personal politics about director Victor Salva.  I won't rehash the reasons since so many reviews here tell the story, but let it be said that I feel he's a detestable human being.  But I'm trying to put those feelings aside(it's difficult though) and just review the film itself.  After all, I learned to do it with Woody Allen's films.  Most of the bad reviews of this film are bashing it for all the wrong reasons.  They're most likely written by ""Scream"" generation horror fans looking for the same kind of thing.  Well, in Jeepers Creepers you won't be getting that, but instead a throwback to the 70s/80s school of bizarre, grindhouse horror flicks.  Very much like the style of Rob Zombie's House of 1,000 Corpses.  This style is more appreciated by the fans of obscure horror films of glory days past.  I'm not defending Jeepers Creepers 100% coz it certainly has it's flaws.  The biggest flaw is an overdose of the ""Creeper.""  It was much more effective to see him from a distance in his attire.  Even as we get closer to him and see what he looks like, it still isn't bad.  Once he sheds his clothes, revealing a silvery, bird-like body, he ceases to be the least bit mysterious or creepy from then on.  They should have kept it simple.  Simplicity with this kind of formula works wonders.  Yes, I agree the main characters are annoying.  The frightened expression that the leading man wears throughout 90% of the film is fake looking and comical.  Reviewers bash this coz all their questions regarding the monster weren't answered.  Does everybody need explanations spoon fed to them?  I thought horror lied within what we don't fully understand;  The unknown.  The current trend in horror films is to have an explanation for EVERYTHING!  That's why older horror films are so much better.  A director had a crazy idea and went with it.  Many classics were made this way.  No one liked the ending.  I don't think the ending could have been any better.  Hero dies and monster gets away.  That's the way a horror film should end if you ask me.  Why make it fluffy and Disney?  Doesn't really belong in horror.  If you want that kind of closure, watch a romance film or a Bruckheimer action flick.  Basically three stars is the best route to go considering it's pretty much Even Steven.

Overall, if you appreciate monster movies like Creature from the Black Lagoon, Gargoyles, The Wolfman, The Relic, The Thing, Pumpkinhead, et al, then you'll most likely enjoy Jeepers Creepers.
On the other hand, if you get easily hung-up on minor plot quibbles or if you're looking for a ""teen slasher"" or, most importantly, if you have trouble suspending disbelief (""This movie is stupid--there's no such thing as monsters!!"") then you may want to look elsewhere for your scares.

1656362,4,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers is one of those disposable monster movies that is reasonably entertaining while not offering anything particularly new.  While it's not a waste of time, if you missed it, your life would be none the poorer for it.  Executed with slightly more intelligence than usual, Jeepers Creepers does offer some fun.
A brother and sister are traveling along a near-deserted highway when they are nearly run off the road by an old truck.  Later they see the truck near an abandoned church and see its owner dumping what appear to be bodies down a pipe.  The sister is smart enough to want to get away as far as possible (and notify the police in the process), but the brother wants to investigate, motivated by curiosity and a desire to save anyone who might still be alive.  What they find is far worse than they imagine.
However, in an inversion of most of these horror films, the characters are actually at their greatest peril not when they stupidly head towards danger but rather when they intelligently go to safety.  Therefore, the more the brother and sister do what the viewer thinks is the right thing, the worse things actually get.
This is pure monster movie.  There is little in the way of plot twists or deep characterization and no romance to speak of; on the other hand, there is a little bit of humor and some okay effects.  Overall, this is slightly above average, a weak four stars, and a pleasant diversion even if it is not anything overly special.",1071187200,,1474,4.642307692307693

1656378,4,B00005RHGK,"One of the best things about JEEPERS CREEPERS is the on-screen interaction between the brother and sister characters played respectively by Justin Long and Gina Philips. Like regular teenagers, they sardonically bicker, tease, and pick at each other when things start out, but when faced with a life-threatening crisis, the genuine love and respect that they have for each other shines through.  In fact, so genuine are their performances that, after watching the film, it is difficult to accept the fact that the two actors are not actually siblings.  Hopefully these excellent young performers will go on to even greater stardom as their talents mature and they fine-tune their art.
But the two young stars aren't the ONLY good thing about this movie.  No siree!  With JEEPERS CREEPERS, writer/director Victor Salva has pulled out nearly all the stops to craft an enjoyable old-fashioned spook-show.  Most of the action takes place in a rural setting during what appears to be early fall, and this creates a very eerie and unsettling atmosphere that harkens back to Tobe Hooper's THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.  In fact, aficionados of the genre will no doubt notice that JEEPERS CREEPERS is replete with nods to horror greats from the cinema past, including not only Hooper's cult classic, but also such films as DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, PSYCHO, Spielberg's DUEL, HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13th,...and the list goes on and on.  In addition, Salva playfully and lovingly pokes fun at many horror clich&eacute;s--worn-out devices like the old dark house, the darkened tunnel, the urban legend, the barely audible warning from a dying victim, the phone call from a stranger, the warning from a psychic, and many more--yet he does so in clever and witty ways that add to the fun of the film and the logical progression of the story.
What would an old-fashioned monster movie be without a monster?  And does JEEPERS CREEPERS ever have one!  Somewhat reptilian in appearance and extremely cunning and intelligent, it is of the coolest, creepiest monsters to hit the cinema since 1979's ALIEN (and its sequels).  Extendable and retractable facial appendages, a mouthful of sharp teeth, big fold-out bat-like wings--all this, and it sews, carves wood, and drives, too!  And in keeping with the nostalgic undertones of the rest of the film, this monster also has characteristics that are reminiscent of nasty cinema favorites from days gone by: DRACULA, the FRANKENSTEIN monster, THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, television's GARGOYLES (1972), the aforementioned titular ghoulie from ALIEN, and more contemporary monsters like Freddy, Jason, and even HANNIBAL the Cannibal.
Filmgoers who enjoy the fun creep-shows of yesteryear will get a real kick out of JEEPERS CREEPERS, but it is also modern and hip enough that younger, less nostalgic genre fans should enjoy it, too.  The DVD from MGM is loaded with cool extras, not the least of which are a feature commentary from writer/director Salva, alternate openings and endings, and some interesting behind-the-scenes featurettes. This one's well worth the price of admission.",1069718400,,3114,5.218436873747495
1656379,4,B00005RHGK,"I have seen this recently, and have to say this is a great film.  Some parts are predictable like ending up down the drain pipe and a ""red herring"" camper, but some parts are not, like the ending is a good example.  Also makes you realize women should not drive stick shifts vehicles with a clutch(just kidding).  The only reason this did not get five stars is the line the guy fed to the woman to go back and see if it was a body in the drainpipe.  There should have been a better reason to go back, or totally take out that part of the framework/film, and just drive back.  A must see film.  You will not be disapointed if you enjoy dark films.  Will remind you of an older movie called ""Gargoyles"" from the 70s, but is better in my opnion.",1069632000,,742,4.146853146853147
1656380,5,B00005RHGK,"The tension in this piece of cinematography  is built up and conveyed superbly- the Creeper's van looms casually into view, just like a normal vehicle, until it lets out a harsh, grinding blare of noise , and we know instantly that the driver is up to no good.
The identity of the killer is revealed with excellant subtlety- the two main charectars see a shadowy figure drop what appears to be a body down a pipe, and we don't see his face very clearly till near the end..
The hepless isolation of being stranded away from home with a monstrous figure after you is conveyed magnificently by the two main charectars.
I know that a lot of noise has been made about the revelation half-way through about the killer's identity- he is eventually revealed to be some kind of cannibalistic demon called the Creeper, with immense strength.
Before we know who he is, however, we are given hints about his supernatural identity via how he drives from the cafe to the church in such a short time.
Personally, I no problem with the charectar turning out to be some kind of monster.
The ending is a bit grim, but this is still a great horror film.",1067904000,2,1134,4.504854368932039

It's great in the use of shadows, lighting and music to keep ones suspense without too much actually gore. Just like the early Universal monsters, i.e. Frankenstein, Dracula... the director recaptures a better ear of horror complete with color and scared teens. A great film for high schoolers. I really liked the monster's appearance and superhuman abilities, especially the wings. The monster certainly has good taste too!
Enjoy this DVD for suspense and don't miss the DVD 'Powder' either.

1656383,2,B00005RHGK,"I didn't really have many expectations when I rented Jeepers Creepers.  It's October, and I thought a horror movie would be appropriate.  So, if the chill of mid October inspires you to watch scary movies, you might want to pass on JC and go for something a little better.
The movie begins with a brother and sister driving down a desserted country road on their way home from college.  From out of nowhere a terrifying truck appears and nearly runs them off the road.  A jolting experience.  Soon thereafter the brother and sister (Darius and Trish) see the truck parked next to a dilapidated building.  A very sinister looking figure is doing something quite suspicious, and he's not too preoccupied to notice Darry and Trish drive by.  Immediately, the 'Creeper' gets in his truck and eventually runs the two off the road.  Good, so far.  And then it gets lame.
Darius insists that the two of them return to the Creeper's apparent home and see what he was up to.  Trish objects, but gives in.  There (the Creeper apparently had other business to attend to and hadn't yet returned) Darius continues to make decisions that will make you yell at the tv in frustration.  Is that good?  There were times when my heart was beating faster than normal, but at the same time I was truly mad about the idiocy of the boy.  And his idiocy and irritating factor never tones down (his character reveals the sophistication of the movie).  After a while I was hoping the Creeper would do him in and get it over with.  The sister, Trish, is likable, and I found myself rooting for her up through the end - I didn't want her to get hurt.  But the slack jawed darius, who's mouth seemed to gape in proportion to his dumbness made the movie too much to bear.
The final scence was also comedic, at least I think.  Maybe it was supposed to be that way, I don't know; it certainly wasn't scary.  Also, the Creeper should have never been shown, at least not in full body shots in ample light.  It was more sinister when he was unknown; being disrobed or unmasked or whatever you want to call it detracted from his creepiness.
Plus (not that the unmasking had everything to do with it), the Creeper was obviously a supernatural being.  Supernatural beings are ok if they're intelligently done, which JC certainly isn't.  For me, being able to identify with the characters and become immersed in the movie, perhaps to the point of feeling like I could be in their shoes or that it could happen to me, is big part of what makes a horror movie scary.  I knew that I would never encounter a supernatural creature the likes of the Creeper; a good horror movie would have manipulated my feelings and thoughts into feeling and thinking that I could have.  But when you rest the weight of your burden on a goof like Darius and get the story rolling with an imbecilic act by the said brother, then it's a good bet you won't succeed.  And Jeepers Creepers doesn't succeed.",1065830400,3,2940,4.5227272727272725
1656384,3,B00005RHGK,"I actually managed to watch this movie without having ever seen the trailer, which accounts for my reaction.  ""Jeepers Creepers"" begins with a pair of bickering siblings, Patricia (Gina Philips) and Darius Jenner (Justin Long) driving home from college along a fairly deserted back road.  Shortly after discussing the local rural legend, a nice little cautionary tale about drinking and driving, a speeding truck (a late 1940's Model Rio, a flatbed truck with the back built up to look a bit like a meat wagon from Hell) sneaks up on them and just about runs them off the road.  Shaken by their escape, the kids become even more rattled when they drive by a rundown church and see the truck, with its odd looking driver now doing something rather unsettling.  To make matters worse, he sees them, and once again the truck sets off in pursuit.
In terms of contemporary horror films, the opening for ""Jeepers Creepers"" is extremely effective.  After all, it takes place in the bright light of day and still manages to creep you out.  But then, as Patty notes, we get to the part where the kids in the movie do something stupid that ultimately dooms them to the horrors of the rest of the film.  Actually, when Darry discovers the grim truth of what has been going on underneath that old church, this 2001 horror film reaches its high point.  At that point ""Jeepers Creepers"" goes off in a rather unexpected and ultimately unrewarding direction.  If you have seen the trailer, then you already know what the payoff is (although why a movie would want to give that much away in the trailer is, as always, beyond me), but I was not only surprised, but rather disappointed.
This is a shame because the performances by the two leads in this film are way above the traditional low bar set in a splatter flick.  Phillips and Long do not especially look like siblings, but they fight like them.  More importantly, they manage to maintain a sense of realism as the proceedings get more absurd.  They are clearly the best thing in this film (Long was nominated for a Saturn Award), along with the truck.  But once Darry learns the truth, writer-director Victor Salva throws away the film's powerful momentum to enter the familiar slasher silliness of Freddy and Jason territory.  Given the level of tension that is created, I was actually a bit miffed that suddenly the film was invoking humor.  The final shot of the film is rather predictable given the premise, but its greater sin is in running counter to the tone of the film's opening.
Admittedly, I might have rated this film higher if I had known what it was really all about because then the payoff would not have been such a disappointment.  To be fair, given how strong the opening of ""Jeepers Creepers"" is it might have been impossible to come up with an ending as good, but I sure would have liked to have seen Salva come up with a better effort.  Now there is a sequel to this 2001 film, which just reconfirms another of my working hypotheses, that a really great horror film precludes the possibility of a sequel, whatever the appeal of the box office.",1065571200,7,3104,4.635036496350365
1656385,5,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers is one of the most effective, fresh, creepy horror films to come along in the past few years, and I enjoyed it immensely.  You may find some of the elements from this film elsewhere, but Jeepers Creepers really does have its own unique story to tell.  The plot breaks down a little bit in the final half hour, but everything up to that point is simply superb.
I love the opening scenes; this really doesn't even seem like a movie for the first half hour.  You have a very typical brother and sister cruising down a deserted road in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the day.  I entered this film with dark aspirations in mind, so the bright, peaceful setting of the opening really grabbed my attention.  It may be a lonely stretch of road, but the setting is one of safety and serenity - until, that is, a character in a super-charged old van tries to wreck the car holding our protagonists.  For Patricia and Darius Jenner (Gina Philips and Justin Long, respectively), this frightening bit of road rage proves to be only the start of a horrible night.  On down the road, the pair catch sight of the evil van parked beside an old, crumbling building; looking closer, they see the driver of the truck tossing a couple of items that certainly look like bodies wrapped in blood-soaked sheets down a big pipe.  The bad guy sees the kids pass by and immediately starts out in pursuit, doing all he can to wreck them.  Darius eventually has the brilliant idea of going back to the pipe to see if anyone is still alive down there, and his much smarter sister cannot talk him out of this notion.  Here marks the upping of the creepiness factor.  There are many significant things to be found in the chamber below; finding a way out, though proves to be a challenge as Darius soon discovers.  Eventually a shell-shocked Darius and Trish make it to a roadside restaurant and call the police.  Things get weirder, though, when an anonymous stranger calls Darius and Trish and explains the things she has been seeing in her visions, warning them that the ""thing"" will not stop coming after them.  This proves to be quite the understatement.  The Creeper, whoever or whatever he is, is relentless in his pursuit of the scared youngsters, leading to one exciting confrontation after another in a variety of venues.  Things progress quite nicely to an ending that is both good and bad; good in the sense that it does not pull a fairy tale ending out of the hat, but bad in that the final five minutes prove anticlimactic, forced, and generally unsatisfying.
Personally, I have to say I wasn't that impressed with the costume and special effects of the Creeper; from a distance, or coiled in shadows, he's pretty intimidating, but his visual effect on the viewer decreases as we see more of him.  Writer/director Victor Salva envisioned this film as his own ""monster movie,"" but I think that a more human boogeyman would have served this story more effectively.  Justin Long has some kind of David Schwimmer thing going on at times, but he is otherwise quite convincing in the role of Darius; he is the one who sees firsthand the handiwork of the Creeper, and the effects of what he has seen are reflected dramatically on his face and spirit.  Gina Philips is fantastic; she may well be the sexiest female on the planet, as well.  More than just a pretty face, the depth of her commitment and talent are demonstrated quite convincingly in the six featurettes on the making of the movie.  These featurettes, by the way, are quite good.  The deleted and extended scenes housed on the DVD, though, aren't that impressive; for the life of me, I could hardly find the difference between the alternate and final versions of a few scenes in the movie.
Jeepers Creepers is just a terrific, vastly underrated horror film.  Relying more on suspense than blood and gore (although there is a certain amount of gore to be found here), this would make an especially good introduction to the genre for those yet to dip their feet into the deep, dark side of the entertainment pool.",1065225600,,4072,4.617198335644938

1656407,3,B00005RHGK,"Victor Salva (Powder) wrote and directed this surprise 2001 horror hit in which two teen siblings (Gina Philips and Justin Long) come across an ancient flesh eating demon who feasts every 23rd spring, and naturally, both of them are next on the menu.  What could have been another modern day teeniebopper horror fest manages to be tenion fueled (the opening truck chase nicely sets the tone), but Jeepers Creepers fails to live up to it's full potential.  Horror vets will appreciate the heart that Salva and co. had in making the film (which despite it's small budget manages to shine more than some big budget horror films a la the last Halloween movie), but don't expect anything really special from it.

1656408,1,B00005RHGK,"The film starts out on a deserted highway, which should give you the clue that this is one of those horrors that intends to go nowhere, in no great hurry. The story (if you can call it that) centres around a brother and sister returning home when after they overtake a dusty old lorry, wait for it, awaken an ancient demon's reign of terror.
  The movie has no fear factor, the supposed demon looks a cross between Victor Meldrew and Alf Garnett, (the latter's more scary) and the suspense is non-existent. Which is a shame because it is one of those hippy left-wing horrors that chooses to eschew horror for suspense. Director Victor Salva thinks all you have to do is crank the violins up and force eyedrops into his actors to sustain the horror induced wide-eyed look. How wrong he is.
  Salva has conjectured a film of bluff. Just when you think the film is about to deliver the gruesome goods, it falls flat on its face. The siblings reach an old lady's large rundown house, and we can only see the back of her head. The viewer is anticipating that when she turns around, we'll be confronted with the apparition of a nasty gargoyle, but no such luck, it's just an old lady.
  Without giving the ending away, you'd think its a given for the protagonists to win, expecially given the fact Salva has little left to play with other than a morality tale (having lost the signpost for horror a while back.) But Salva isn't one for convention. If you consider this a twist, you're either very undemanding, or your someone that having sat through its 86 mins (sounds short doesn't it) you cant believe how the most hyped horror film since A Nightmare On Elm Street is such a flop. I know I belong to the latter.",1063843200,2,1708,4.47588424437299
1656409,4,B00005RHGK,"Let me start off by saying that when it comes to scary movies I'm a big wussie.  So when Jeepers Creepers came out in theatres I didn't rush to see it.  About a year or so later they showed it on Showtime and I figured I was safe within the confines of my own home.  The boogie man couldn't get thru my two inch thick wooden door or cheap window glass pane (I know, I'm an idiot).  So I sat down and since there was nothing else on, I watched.  Let me continue by saying this movie was not scary.  The people that said this movie was the scariest thing they've seen in years either have to get out more or are bigger wussies then I am (and I am up there).  Now even though the movie was not scary it was still an ok movie that's good on a rainy day or when you've got an hour and a half to kill.  So sit back and read on while I tell you the story of the Creeper.  The movie starts out with two collage siblings Trish and Darry.  They decide to ride home together and on the way they play brother and sister games like who can read a vanity license plate first and calling each other names (basicly bugging each other, if you have a sibling like I do then you know what I mean).  While driving, they almost get run off the road by a big old farmers truck with a suped up egine, his license plate: BEATNGU.  The truck passes them and the kids contine down the road.  A few miles down they see the truck again.  This time it's parked next to an old church and this (looks like a) man is throwing a few things down a sewer pipe, things resembling dead bodies wraped in bloody sheets.  Now this is the part of the movie where you stand up from your chair, point your finger to the screen and yell ""IDIOT"".  Instead of going straight to the cops the kids decide to make a u-turn and head to the old church to see what is at the end of the sewer pipe.  Sister Trish holds brother Darry by the ankles to get a closer look in the pipe but when they both see rats they both freak out and Trish lets go of her brother and down he goes.  The pipe leads to the cellar of the church and Darry tells Trish to basicly wait on the side of the road till she see help while He finds a way out.  While he's down there Darry sees one of the wraped packages seen thrown down the pipe, when he opens it he is shocked to find a body with a homemade surgical cut running down the torso but the body is still alive.  He also finds hundreds of dead naked bodies stuck to the ceiling and walls like christmas decorations.  Darry finds a way back to his sister and they head to the nearest phone to call the police.  They stop at a diner and while there they get a call on the pay phone from a women who says she has seen everything that will happen and tries to warn them.  They don't believe her and they hang up.  The police then show up, the kids tells their story and the police give them an escort back to the station.  But on the way they run into a little trouble.  The Creeper (the bad guy in this flick) takes out the two cops and then begins to eat one of their heads (at least the tounge).  The kids don't believe what they're seeing and then drive off to find another phone.  They find an old lady with a bunch of cats (a vision from the pay phone lady) but before the are able to use her phone the Creeper takes her out.  The kids get back in the car and try to leave but the Creeper stands in the middle of the road blocking their way.  Then after running him over 4 or 5 times we see that the villian in this pic... has wings?  The two get to the police station, tell the cops what happened and then call their parents.  The lady that called them at the diner shows up and tries two warn them again that the Creeper is after one of them.  Then tells them the storry of our monster.  Every 23 years for 23 days it gets to eat all it wants.  And its favorite meal on the menu is people.  Just then the lights and the phones go out and the cops try to battle the monster but nothing works.  So who does the Creeper want?  Who lives and who dies (besides almost every body)?  Will you feel you've wasted an hour and a half of your life after this?  Maybe, maybe not.  The dead bodies look really fake and the CGI on the wings and the flying Creeper look bad, not terrible but bad.  But if you like movies that are supposed to be scary and aren't then I suggest you pick up this dvd (to rent or buy).  It's got alternate endings and some other good stuff, I might pick mine up tomorrow.  I gave the movie 4 stars even though it only deserves 3, 3 and a half tops but you can't give 3 and a half and 3 isn't enough.

How they can justify calling some one ignorant after not like THIS movie is beyond my comprehension. Now I'm not insulting anyone who liked this movie because not everyone has the same taste, but in my opinion this movie was TERRIBLE. This could even quite possibly be one of the THE WORST movies I have ever seen. Starting with the conversation in the car I knew this movie was going to be terrible, and it was. There was not one scary moment in this whole movie and I regret ever taking two hours out of my life to watch it. Just a horrible, HORRIBLE movie. Now to sit here and say this movie was bad and not give any reason just wouldn't be fair.
Why This Movie Was Terrible:
* From the beginning to the end, this movie had absolutely no intelligence with any character. Just basic 'sure let me go down this dark creepy tunnel with no flashlight' scenario.
* Boring. Any moment when they weren't doing something stupid they were talking and I cannot describe to how terribly boring the conversations were.
* Bland. This movie consisted of the same old horror/ thriller formula that has been used to death. No redeeming qualities at all.
So with all this said the only good scene throughout the whole movie you're probably telling yourself that there that had to be AT LEAST one good scene. Well the end was the only good scene in the movie, not becuase it was a twist or anything, but if you hated this movie as much as I did then you'll understand why.

1656420,1,B00005RHGK,"I rented this based on a few reviews I'd read (""best horror of the last 10 years"" sticks in my mind) and was sitting down, eagerly anticipating a 90-minute scare-fest.  What I got was a guy who looked like Barbra Streisand's son, and a girl who looked like her daughter, and both of whom acted like Madonna's less talented siblings.
Other reviews I'd read talked about suspense, building of atmosphere, style over schlock.  No.  What you get is implausibility after another, quickly followed by cliche upon cliche.  To wit, we have a typical bro-sis relationship that allows them to have arguments while stuff goes on unnoticed in the background; an ancient car that you know just won't start when it's needed to; a mobile phone whose battery has run down; a sleepy backward town where the residents don't believe our 'heros'; ineffective unbelieving police; a black soothsayer who can perhaps predict what will happen (hm, why?!), all of this topped off by absolutely dreadful dialogue, delivered with the expertise of a 5-year-old in a nativity play.
I think the reviewers were mistaking suspense for annoyance, atmosphere for dismay, and style for... I don't know what. This is just one truly bad film, replete with self-knowing 'post-modernist' lines (""this is the part in scary movies where the audience are thinking don't do that"" - or something to that effect).
This is the part of the review where the writer is urging you not to get this!  Trust me, you'll be wanting to throw things at the TV, so annoying is the film!",1060128000,3,1528,4.839080459770115
1656421,4,B00005RHGK,"This is actually a well plotted above average teen horror flick from director Victor Salva(most recently seen in the drama film Powder)
The first 20 minutes or so of this movie are truly tense and quite scary as we find a young brother & sister travelling home for spring break in an old car. As they drive along in a more than deserted part of the countryside, they witness a macabre looking stranger doing something they can't quite believe after a near miss on the highway, and quickly begin to fear for their own safety. Without divulging too much of the storyline, the picture gathers pace from this point and more than cleverly keeps up the tension without falling into the usual gratuitous gore or fantastical scenes. Fans of this type of movie will certainly find plenty to enjoy, although the power of the movie is placed much more firmly in the psychological aspect, than the more common ""in your face"" horror, in fact there are even one or two references to the horror movie genre by the stars themselves, woven nicely into the script. The two main characters are played with huge credibility by the relative newcomers Gina Phillips and Justin Long, who are probably remembered for their recent outings in films like of Telling You &  the very different Galaxy Quest respectively. Their portrayal of two very scared youngsters comes across well, and puts the viewer, easily into their situations. My only complaint about the movie would be the directors insistence on incorporating a fantastic element eventually into the direction, in an attempt to follow a supernatural theme. This works OK, but one has to say or more believable or credible explanation of the events we are seeing, would have been even better.
The movie has something of a low budget feel, but this is not in any way detrimental to the story, and almost adds something to the feeling of isolation in the locations depicted. All this said, this is a very well made movie with more than a few suprises along the way, and an ending that is certainly not ""out of the box"". There are several short scenes of gory violence, but not too much to warrant an R rating otherwise. Enjoy.",1059350400,2,2156,4.718832891246684
1656422,5,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers is a scary film that gets your heart racing and it does get you pretty excited. The music and the scenery is what really sets the whole mood of the movie. Throught out the film there are scenes where it is pretty dark and some very bright. It takes place in a very rural area, where you rarely ever see any cars. The setting is also completed with crows, an old gas station, and an old abandonded, dilapidated church.
The music is mostly instrumental, and of course their is the famous song, ""Jeepers Creepers"". The instrumental music is very grim and can in some climaxing parts of the movie get pretty loud and even more creepy sounding.
I think the best aspect of the movie is the fact that they really don't reveal the sinister character in a way that it didn't look really fake at all. It wasn't like in the movie Signs how they showed the alien completely, they kind of kept this characters appearence a secret. It wasn't until later in the movie they showed the characters face for a short time. I am not going to give the movie away, but their was a scene in the movie where they did show the body of a person, but they used a wax person, and it did look fake. You could definately tell that the person was not real and you could see how the features were implied.
Jeepers Creepers is not one of those chessy films, in which you know what is going to happen in every scene. The film has its mysteries, and you will definately not get bored from watching it. The movie gives a great performance from Justin Long and Gina Phillips. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again, and it will still scare you each time.
The DVD also features great special features. The DVD disc has two sides to it. On one side you can play the film. On this side you can turn the Audio comentary with the director Victor Salva on or off,you can decide whether you want Widescreen or Standard sized screen, and you can decide between three spoken languages. Another thing you can do is look at the cast's filmographies. On the other side it has all the other special features. You can enjoy watching deleted and extended scenes, the making of the movie, and theatrical trailers of the following movies:
Jeepers Creepers, Hannibal,The Silence of the Lambs Special Edition DVD Trailer, The Terminator Special Edition DVD Trailer, and the Carrie Special Edition DVD Trailer.
All in all I think that if you love to watch scary movies, than this is the right movie for you. I hope this review was very helpful to you and if was than, please let me know, and you can also look out for other movies that I have rated. Thank You.",1057708800,2,2640,4.40081799591002

The first first half-hour is great and suspenseful (I'm a jaded 13 year old and it actually scared me once). The second act is pretty good as we finally see the Creeper. The third act in the police station is still pretty good. To bad they had to ruin it all with the final frame. I mean it's pretty cool. (I won't reveal it to those of you who haven't seen it) The problem is that the ending's to abrupt and unsatisfying. It also has one huge plot hole. One you see it you'll probably figure it out. Not to say it's bad, I mean when you look back on it, it's pretty cool, but in the moment it's really, really lame.

I found it to be extremely unsettling and the movie stayed with me some time after watching it, which is a good sign that the film succeeded in creeping me out! The only other films I've seen in recent years that affected me the same way were The Blair Witch Project and the original Japanese version of The Ring. I'm heartily sick of derivative slasher flicks cast with teens/20somethings that are boringly predictable, like Valentine, Urban Legends and the latest Halloween and Friday The 13th sequels, so this one was like a breath of fresh air to a jaded horror fan.
The DVD is great. The special features are well selected and informative which is why I imported this one from the US.

  The movie starts out when two teens r travelling home on a desolate country back road and before they realize it a big truck nearly runs them over and speeds ahead. Although lots of people said this was rlly chilling and scary beggining i didn't find anything to creepy about it. Anyways later they drive past an old churh and see the truck parked in the driveway and they see the driver shoving what appears to be a few bodies down a pipe. The driver sees them and atempts to run them over this time but they escape. Although any sane people after that would go run away and call the cops these two decide to go back and look in the pipe. Due to the extreme brilliance of the screenwriters one of them falls down the pipe(thought u never saw that coming eh?)and discovers a chamber ful of bodies and horryfying secrets!...after this the movie starts to flop.
  Pretty much after this the guy who fell gets out of the pipe and the two drive to a diner. Before being able to call the police they get a call from a mysterious psychic and slowly start to learn the savage, horror filled story behind this demon that does this to people and why, I for one would of been much happier if it wasent some magical demon with wings and all, but instead a terryfying serial killer, but oh well u cant win them all.
  The plot was pretty good and of coarse there where some holes in it and I think that they could of explained what this beast was some more and the makeup and and bodies were not that realsitic, but besides that it had pretty good acting and everything else.
  So if your looking for some pretty good scary thrills and some good suspense then I suggest that you watch this. If your one of those people who hates monster movies then I suggest watching this up until the middle of it then turning it off.

1656443,3,B00005RHGK,"The next time somebody says to you that road trips are fun, slap them in the face. After doing that, tell them to see this movie. I was not expecting much of anything since the movie got a horrible average rating. Don't let that fool you. The movie isn't great art, but it's wonderfully put together and delivers an hour and a half of innocent entertainment. A brother and sister are traveling back home for spring break. The brother's name is Darry(Justin Long), and the sister is Trisha(Gina Phillips). Their road trip seems to be pretty typical. Playing licence plate games and talking. They seem to hit on the subject that their parents' marriage is iin trouble, and that Trish's own relationship is over. Things go horrible when a big, dumpy looking truck begins tailing them on the highway. The truck scares them a little and then moves on. The siblings later see the truck parked at an abandoned church. A strange looking figure is taking objects wrapped up in sheets and dumping them down a pipe. After another cat and mouse scene between the two cars, the two go back to investigate, thinking they were bodies and that someone else may be alive. Once they find out that it was bodies that were being dumped, Darry also discovers that there are hundreds of bodies in this basement that are preserved and sewn up. From this point on, the brother and sister team struggle to contact help and to flee from this psycho. When they have an encounter with a psychic named Jezelle(Patricia Belcher), they learn of what is really going on. This monster is a regurgating monster that needs to eat body parts to stay alive. Whatever he eats, and you know what he eats, becomes a part of him. Every 23 years, he feeds. She also tells them that whenever the title song plays, something terrible is about to happen. It all ends with a climax that takes place in a locked down police station that was exciting and shot nicely. The movie was written and directed by Victor Salva, the man who did ""Powder"". He has a nice eye and give us some nice shots and fun angles with the camera. He really sets the setting and makes it eerie and intriguing. The film is pretty much straight terror, but there are some comical moments spread out here and there. While it's a film that can't be taken seriously, it appears to be a fillm that was taken seriously from Salva and his cast and crew. They wanted to put together an incredibly fun, thrill ride and they have done just that. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It is what it is and it does it very competently. It delivers in the 'fun' category. The monster itself is very creepy, and very nightmarish. The make-up design of the creature was very good. The acting is all pretty solid. Gina Phillips, not only being beautiful in the classic sense, was a strong heroine. She was tough and ballsy. Justin Long did a decent job as her terrified brother. Veteran actress Eileen Brennan pops up as The Cat Lady, in a set piece that's one of the better ones. Jonathan Breck plays the monster. He does a good job in bringing out the creeps in the role. The film differs from horror films of the last few years. While it was praised as being away from the ""Scream"" era, it really isn't. There are some lines in the film that would of been right at home in any of the ""Scream"" films. Plus, these are two different types of films, and shouldn't be compared. ""Jeepers Creepers"" was a lot better than I thought it would be. If I had listened to bad reviews and the low average rating, I would have missed out on a pretty fun and entertaining film.

After the driver of the truck tries to run them off the road again,Darry and Trish decide to go back to the church to see if anyone needs help,what they discover at the bottom of the pipe is far worse then they could have ever imagined and now the creeper as his sights set on the siblings. The design of the creeper(played by Jonathan Breck)is a really neat,new and fresh look to see. There are alot of twisted scenes like the tounge scene for example.

I was so excited to watch this movie in the beginning but the end was such a dissappointment. I never want to see it again.
The movie begins with two college students, a brother and sister, in a car driving down a desolate road in the middle of nowhere to visit their parents. After seeing no cars for hours, they are suprised to hear the beeping of a truck horn behind them. Looking out the rear view mirror, they see a rusty old truck with foggy, smudged windows swerving across the road. The driver tries to rear-end them, but they manage to escape just in time. The truck displays an eerie license plate. I personally think this was the scariest part of the movie, though it just went downhill from here. They come in contact with the truck later on as they see a shadowy cloaked figure in the backwoods of a church, dumping large canvas bags covered with blood into what looks like a sewer. They go back later to see what they are, and find a gorey, distgusting surprise in the basement of the church.
If you consider blood, gore, and disturbing images to be scary and absolutely fightening, then you'd better not watch this movie. I personally think all of those things take away from a movie that promises to be scary - I find them all gross! The ending is also something that will end up having you throwing this movie back onto a shelf and leaving it there forever. As my friends screamed in horror around me while watching ""Jeepers Creepers,"" I just sat on the bed in astonishment to how bad this movie was, I had to wonder, was this movie not scary, was I not easily frightened, or are my friends just the opposite of myself?

The first half, with 'Duel'-like cat-and-mouse game as well as the menacing figure of the Creeper dumping bodies into the sewer worked very well. The church added a nice, gothic touch and the rural setting pumped up the atmosphere very nicely....then....well.....things started getting really stupid.
The Creeper, once revealed, looked really unconvincing - looked like a guy in a mask. The plot got pretty convuluted and silly, offering answers with no explinations/back story other than to move the plot along. It became, just like past reviewers said, a C-Grade horror flick at best.

What do you do? Get the heck out of there, right? No...these idiots decide to investigate.  Obviously the brother and sister had to run into the Creeper some kind of way to get the movie started but this was simply idiotic.
The Creeper does this every 23 years, so how come no one in town seems to have noticed missing loved ones? In fact, how come the folks in town don't just go on vacation during the Creeper's feeding time?
The Creeper himself is a scary creature until you see all of him then he becomes a laughable special effect. Okay, I'll admit that the last iamge of the movie was impressive but that's five minutes in an otherwise dopey movie.",1043020800,,1181,4.272321428571429
1656476,2,B00005RHGK,"""Jeepers Creepers"" is a movie I remember hearing a lot of mixed buzz about. Some people\critics hailed it as one of the scariest movies ever! While others said it ranks among the worst ever made. I had wanted to see ""Jeepers Creepers"" when it was firsted released,but, just never got around to it. Then, one day I just decided to rent it, since I'm a fan of the genre.
 ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a movie I think that does have some suspenseful moments. I also think the film's first half bour is brilliant. And by that I mean, it's set-up is wonderful. The suspense slowly builds up because we don't know what kind of movie we are in for. We have no way of knowing where this plot will take us. As for dialogue well, the film suffers, and the movie has too many loop holes that don't bring the movie together, plus, it just gets plan silly. But, I'm getting ahead of myself here.
 ""Jeepers Creepers"" starts off as a brother and sister Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are driving home from school. Soon they encounter a strange driver on the road who nearly runs them right off the road. As they drive on, they see him again, this time, he's off the road, and they see him throwing bodies down a pipe. Now, all of this believe it or not works. But, what happens inbetween this, doesn't work.
 First of all, the two kids start talking about their mother. Okay, what about her? I don't know. They say that she's change, that she;s not herself anymore. OK, why? Does she have a physical problem? Is she breaking up with her husband? Did her husband die? Or is she just lonely? We never know. Information is given to us, but, it's never completed. We know Trish (Gina Philips) breaks up with her boyfriend, why? The writers were just trying to make this characters have a conversation for the film doesn't become boring until the action happens. But, why make the characters talk about things that won't have anything to do with the movie. We don't want to hear it. Why not try writing USEFUL dialogue?
 After the first half hour, the film become odd, but, I was willing to go along with it. We find out something about the driver in the begining of the movie (don't worry I won't spoil it). And then we start to second guess our opinion of why we rented this in the first place. So now, the film just becomes silly. Here's an example, the kids are soon told they whenever they hear the Harry Warren song ""Jeepers Creepers"" expect trouble. Never in all my life would I have expected the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" to represent evil! Also, we are told that the ""crepper"" attacks ever 23 years! And the funny thing is, no one else knows about this. That leads to another question. Exactly how long has this been going on?
 Director Victor Salva is not a talentless director I feel. He might be able to actually make a good, scary horror flick one of these days. He just needs to prepare himself better. That's what really breaks this film. The elements are there for a good movie, but, they just weren't used properly. Maybe ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" will be better. Who knows. I personally would advise you not to watch this movie. If you like the teen horror genre I prefer ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", and ""The Glass House"".
 Bottom-line: Suspensefull, but ultimately silly horror film that just doesn't scare us enough but makes us think of what could of been. Decent acting, so-so scrpit.",1041984000,,3415,4.491143317230274
1656477,3,B00005RHGK,"This movie starts out very well, but it weakens toward the middle, and the ending is poor.  The brother and sister team worked very well together, and came off as being very real and natural.  The creature in the film was very well done, also, and I highly commend the actor who carried out this role.  The gargoyle-like creature was terrifying to look at, especially when he was carrying his ax, and I would have liked to see more of him in the film, as the special effects were quite good.  What was really lacking in this film, though, was background information on the creature. All through the movie I wondered if the creature was a gargoyle, something unique, or what, but  no background was given in the film. Some may say that this unknown element added mystery, but I felt that it left gaps that weakened the storyline. More spooky background information from one of the townspeople in the movie would make a sequel more interesting than the original, in my opinion.  I wouldn't rank this as a very scary film, but it had the potential to be terrifying.",1041897600,,1062,4.563157894736842

I liked the fact that the movie went with a family angle (brother/sister) rather than another overused ""romantic couple getaway that turned deadly"" kind of film. Another aspect of the film that works is the dialogue. I can't remember their names, but the brother/sister duo had great chemistry together. The movie lives up to its title and I did find it creepy. Another refreshing factor in the movie is the ending. Many horror movies have a certain formula but this one went against your typical hollywood ending. Overall, if you like being scared, this'll do it to you. I didn't give the film 5 stars though because I feel like it ended too quickly and didn't cover enough ground.

Then you acctually see the monster. OH MI FREAKING GOD! Its so [bad]! They should have just kept it covered up, and not let eople see it.  THAT would have given it a more creepy sence. Instead you get to see the most unbelivable FLYING monster ever.

1656493,3,B00005RHGK,"JEEPERS CREEPERS had so much potential. The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie were enthralling. The banter between the brother and sister was great, and rather realistic and other than the profanity reminded me of conversations I have had on long drives. The way one sees the Winnebago turn a corner in the backseat window and the BEATNU truck suddenly come up behind the sibling pair is a classic piece of cinematography. The way the film continues to build up with some more DUEL-type suspense is great. However, once the brother and sister check out the pipe behind the old church, the film starts to fall apart.

The movie slows down a lot after that and I found myself fastforward viewing through the slowest moments. A lot of elements are introduced to the story that have little bearing on the plot. And the song, what in the world does the song Jeepers Creepers have to do with the movie? Nothing as far as I could tell.

The Creeper itself may not have been that impressive of a monster. However, I found it nice for once to have a horror movie where the horror was a real monster. Unfortunately, this monster is indestructible. That makes the film rather disappointing. What's the point in fighting a battle (or watching a movie) where nothing, absolutely nothing, can be gained? I mean, come on, even Superman has kryptonite and demons can be exorcised; every creature has to have some weakness. But apparently, the Creeper doesn't. That's a shame because it would have made the showdown in the police station all that more interesting.",1037404800,,1558,4.745387453874539

Sometimes it happens, but certainly not in the case of JEEPERS CREEPERS.  The beginning is promising but the constant bickering between the brother and sister just got annoying.  Justin Long's (the brother) aggression was very over the top too. Let's face it, the acting all over this film was appalling.  The main problem with the film is the villain.  The film loses total credibility when you see what he is - a bat-like figure with wings who hungers for human flesh, that tries to dress like a man. I mean, come on! I scanned through some scenes later on, so the film would finish more quickly.

THE MOVIE: This was one of the best horror movies of last year. Starting like a road suspense film and making an interesting turn in going into the old 80's style monster genre, JEEPERS CREEPERS succeeds VERY successfully in making its audience exceptionally scared and totally intrigued. The acting, designs and shots in this movie are all very original and create an intense and dreading atmosphere. While it's not a masterpiece, JEEPERS CREEPERS is probably one of the most original thrillers you'll find these days. And you just can't forget that chilling final shot...
THE SPECIAL FEATURES (this refers to the NZ Region 4 edition): Just a theatrical trailer. A good theatrical trailer, but that's all. Boo-hoo.",1035590400,,732,5.159663865546219
1656498,1,B00005RHGK,"The creeper was a gargoyle with a chemistry set.  He drove that truck like a ""bat"" out of heck.  He must also be a mechanic to keep the truck running.  It was a very fuel efficient truck, or he has his very own endless fuel source.  It's not like he is going to pull up to the local gas station, even though everyone in the movie is too stupid to notice him.
  In short:  This movie was an extreme waste of time.
  More detailed:  The chemist bat who never gets pulled over for speeding eats body parts of people to gain them for himself.  The teenagers were idiots.  They see the bat throwing bodies down a pipe and do they go and tell police?  No, they go back and crawl in head first.  FYI, the pipe was just a passage between the cellar and the upper level; why did it have water in it?  The boy inside that grabbed his ankle would not have been alive.  If you have your chest cut open like that, you die.  The negative pressure that fills your lungs is neutrallized and you exsanguinate or asphyxiate.
  The psychic was a really stupid move.  She acted as a narrator rather than a character in the movie, and the make up was terrible.  The bat was wearing contacts.
  This movie was not scary at all, only startling.  In the end, you're glad that the boy dies for being so stupid in the beginning.  I'm sorry if I spoiled this movie for you, but if this prevents you from seeing this movie, then I've done you a favor.",1035504000,3,1423,4.181481481481481

1656500,4,B00005RHGK,"I think what makes all of the old Universal horror films so timeless is that at the time they were released, there was nothing else like them. Think about it.
When Bela Lugosi donned his cape in Dracula, vampires were still a new concept to American audiences.  What was a werewolf, if not some old European folk tale?  Who had ever pieced dead bodies together and brought them back to life before Frankenstein did it?  Jeepers Creepers introduces a new monster.  One that kills and consumes to regenerate itself.  If we have seen this before, it was just in nibbles and sniffs.  This movie is an eyes-open full-blown look into the face of a new creature in our monster pantheon.
Jeepers Creepers was born in the late 1990's, early 2000's, when Wes Craven and his Scream franchise had rejuvinated the killer-with-a-knife formula that was started as far back as Psycho, distilled in the Texas Chainsaw massacre, and refined for the masses in Halloween and Friday the 13th.  The previews for Jeepers Creepers sure give the impression of yet another tale of pouty, posturing teens stalked by a masked avenger with a knife who wants to punish them for their sexual transgressions.
In reality, what Jeepers Creepers delivers is a throwback to the days when a monster was a monster and there were things moving in the dark.
I just finished watching this film for the fourth time about 10 minutes ago and I realize there are some glaring holes in the story (i.e. how does a monster go to the DMV office and get personailized plates AND somehow get the lettering to be uneven and jumbled in a ""crazy"" way?).
If you read my other reviews, you will notice I watch a lot of horror films.  If you enjoy horror films also, then there is one thing you probably already know.. do not expect perfect continuity.  If you watch an historical drama, then I guess you expect accuracy and continuity.  In horror films, that isn't the case.
To enjoy a horror film, I expect a few things.  First, take me some place where I am uncomfortable.  Make me question my safety.  Make me feel that no matter what I do, I am going to meet with a gruesome end.
Jeepers Creepers introduces us to the ""Creeper"", a new addition to the pantheon of classic horror figures.  The entire story takes place during one fateful afternoon/evening, along a country road in (place you favorite southern state name here).  It is hot.  The characters are sweaty and you can almost smell them.  The Creeper certainly can.
The Amazon review tells most of the secrets of the film.  If you are reading this, then what you really want to know is ""why should I watch this movie?  Well, all I can offer is that it is different.  If you want a good, old fashioned monster flick, then by God you came to the right place.
i would give this film 5 stars but there are those nasty plot holes, plus director Victor Salva was busted for ""certain"" crimes which I must protest.  I must say that he did a fine job filming this creature feature though.",1033862400,2,2985,4.562851782363977

Badly thought through and to top it off, some fine acting...
A classic example of Hollywood raping good ideas, in this decade where films, music and computer games are being recycled over and over again, and this is their attempt at something new???

The movie gets insanely dumb and unbelievable at the halfway point. The ending is not very creative and just does not go indepth about who or what the Creeper is. The Creeper's design was also a little dissappointing It looked like a guy wearing a latex halloween mask. Also, the stupidity of the teenagers was pretty annoying.

They think nothing of the matter, until later down the road they drive by the house of that same truck driver and see him dumping ""something"" wrapped in blood soaked sheets down a hole in his yard. Of course, this is a horror movie, and the characters soon make a very stupid move in the next five minutes, but I won't ruin anymore of it for you (since it's the only section of the movie you will enjoy). Needless to say, what results is very tense and exciting. As I was watching it I just kept thinking in my head, over and over, ""This is the best movie I have ever seen"" but once you see how the movie moves into it's second and third acts, you will see why this movie just bottoms out on so many levels. First of all, the ""killer"" was so much freakier and scarier when I didn't know his motive or even what he is (That just REALLY ruined the movie). Add to that some stupid psychic lady thrown into the mix for no reason, and this movie just doesn't deliver. Like I said before, it's quite sad. The people who made this movie should have known better than to ruin such potential.",1024617600,7,1780,4.300595238095238

1656539,1,B00005RHGK,"I spent most of the time wondering if the movie was supposed to be an ironically hackneyed reworking of grade Z horror movie material: the ""scary"" truck, the wierd creepy shadowy degenerate driving it, the teens mouthing one-liner put-downs at eachother.  And then there is the ""creature"" when you do get a load of him.  And it looks like something out of a bad spinoff of Deep Space 9.  In fact I think maybe some guy with a bunch of crud on his face who's supposed on that account to be some kind of alien would have been much more compelling than the thing in this movie.  Also in the hackneyed teen slasher genre the movie's development depends on teens acting in ways that no person would:  the teens are run off the road twice and nearly killed by the creepy shadowy driver of the scary truck - a guy who for a homicidal maniac certainly doesn't seem too concerned with keeping a low profile and is not above random acts of pointless terrorism - and, after seeing said nutjob in his backyard piling what seem to be bodies into a sewer pipe, decide they must drive in there, take their sweet time looking around the place, and eventually crawl into the sewerpipe to further sniff around.  ""There could be somebody down there who needs our help!""  Indeed.  This movie is only horrifying insofar as it is a demonstration of Darwinism being disedifyingly thwarted:  the brain-dead teens with not the slightest stirrings of an instinct of self-preservation are of course not going to be justly put to death.",1023753600,,1508,4.597014925373134

1656558,2,B00005RHGK,"Well, I think this movie has one single reason for being worth seeing: I had never seen such a good plot fall down so bad!!
The reason I say this movies is actually composed by two different movies is simple: The first half of the movie is one of the creepiest, scariest and best-done of the last couple of years. It really scares the [stuff] out of you, and it also takes some well-known formulas from well-known classic horror movies. In a nutshell, the first half of it rocks!! So, I give 4 (maybe 5 stars) to Jeepers Creepers' first half.
I bet you would have never imagined a movie with such an amazingly created atmosphere could end up as bad as it did. The reason?? Well, what we don't know and can't see scares us the most... so, when the director decides to show the boogie man's flesh & blood, it all falls down. Not only because of the unbelievable way the plot ends, but also because of the horribly corny scenes --such as ""no please! don't take him! take me! choose me! not my lil'brother!""-- gosh! it was so annoying!!
So, this second half of the movie earns 0 stars. And this fact (earning 4 stars in the 1st half, and 0 in the 2nd) is maybe a good reason for watching the movie. Again, I had never seen a movie break in two as this one did.

1656559,3,B00005RHGK,"Arguably, the best thriller since 'Halloween'. Direction is often inspired - a torch illuminating something for the audience that the protaganist cannot see, the out of focus approach of lights unnoticed by another. Other times crass, such as the discovery of the rifled laundry at the diner. The stop-start nature of the action coupled with a plot revolving around a foregone conclusion prevents a head of steam from truly building, but yields other quirky rewards especially in the mordant humour. The background of the director gives this occasionally terrifying film a nasty edge that makes me feel guilty for liking it.
The original ending is included as an extra, and is to my mind subtler and more terrifying than the more explicit ending we eventually arrived at. Perhaps, rather patronisingly, they didn't think the audience would 'get it'.",1020988800,2,849,5.159420289855072

It started off well... but when straight down hill after that.  Characters in these movies always do dumb things, right?  These kids do so many stupid things that you don't feel sorry for their fate anymore. Maybe it's me, but I feel that the characters should have some control over the outcome of the film.  It becomes apparent just over half way through the movie that there is no way to kill the monster, who not only drives the fastest truck you've ever seen but can also fly. There are so many holes that are not explained in the script.  A few are expected.  But this was ridiculous.  How does the old, seer woman know what she knows. Most importantly what does it mean to the kids who are being hunted by the creature.  She was just a way to get part of the story out without having to shoot more film. I have since warned people in the theater to see other movies instead. Now, I warn you innocent reader.  Watch anything but Jeepers Creepers.",1020816000,,1076,4.393939393939394
1656561,3,B00005RHGK,"For all virtually unknown actors of the film, Japanese release of ""Jeepers Creepers"" was a national-wide, theatrical one, which is surprising, even considering the fact that it has got the U.S. No. 1 position of weekend box-office chart.  But the reason was to be soon clear: for the film was executive-produced by Francis Ford Coppola, and on the Japanese poster his name was printed prominently, as if Coppola himself directed this work.  I wish he did.
Justin Long and Gina Philips are ordinary pair of a brother and a sisiter on the way home until they saw a lusty brown truck rushing from behind.  Not a usual sight on the country road, you know, and nearly they got killed by this spooky truck flying like a bat from hell, they get duely curious.  It ia a foolish thing, of course, but as some wise guy said long time ago, to err is human.  So, they decide to stop the car in order to get a good, clear peep into the place where the truck pulled over.  But wait a minute, the driver might be someone you should never meet, someone not very friendly.
""Jeepers Creepers"" is, indeed, a scary movie if you could devide the whole work into three parts, and see them one by one.  In fact, the film's script is made as if having three segments, each of which shows this weird ""driver"" in point in  different forms.  However, this is the part where many inveterate horror flick fans' opinions divide; some say the film changes its rules too much, making it a nonsense in the end; others say it is a unique, good, old-fashioned horror movie.  The truth is, the director Victor Salva (""Powder"")  gives his own visions as a homage to old, classic genre films -- thriller, horror, monster flick, respectively -- but fails to hold them together with a tight grip.  Each scene is shot with a keen eye to details, to be sure, and the introduction of ""Jeepers"" is really a knockout scene: just look at a dashing truck coming suddenly from the back of the car, which surely gives you a genuine thrill.
However, the stylish visuals of the film is made, sacrificing its storyline, which eventually recedes into a series of simple homages to films in the past.  The first part is clearly inspired by Spielberg's ""The Duel""; the middle part with ominous ravens is a homage to Roger Corman productions like Poe's adaptation; the final chapter, showing a winged strange craeture, naturally reminds us of the monster flicks made in the 40s and 50s -- such as ""The Thing"" as you may remember.  The total effects of the film, therefore, never go beyond that of those past masterpieces, and as a result, its shocking wrap-up scene seems to be covering up the fact that the script of the whole film needs re-writing, which would have definitely saved this rather uneven, illogical horror film from being what it is.
The two leads are good, if not particuarly superb, showing exactly a realistic bond of sister/brotherhood, and Eileen Brennan's cameo adds a propelling power that ""Jeepes"" sometimes lacks.  I know there's a plan of sequel, but hope they take more time to produce it next time.",1020470400,3,3070,4.627992633517495

To me the best part was the first half an hour. It was well made. The car scenes, truck scene and the pipe adventure was SUPERB.
The weak points I found were:
1.  It is a monster movie which I find difficult to swallow, I prefer serial killers characters!
2. There were few mistakes that the director overlooked such as:
a) Trish (Gina Philips) being able to run after the monster kidnapped her brother at the end of the movie although the Police station doors were electrically locked.
b) The policemen not shooting the monster's wings (before he flys with Trish) at the end of the movie although they had more than enough time to do so.
c) The dead bodies in the Church basement were so obviously fake.
d) Darry (Justin Long) body & face at the end of the movie was so obviously fake.
3. In the DVD bonuses (the making of the movie) I didn't like the comments & big ego of the director (Victor Salva). I found his claim that he can do better than the movies ""The Sixth Sense"" & ""Blair Witch Project"", very much offending.

1656568,4,B00005RHGK,"This surprise hit perhaps shows that audiences have really been craving such basic horrror as what 'Jeepers Creepers' really is.  The story has two teenagers driving home from college only to encounter a huge van that tries to run them off the road.  Subsequent encounters prove it to be a flesh-eating demon that requires bodyparts to survive and needs something from the two teens.
With movies such as this there are always pitfalls to go along with moments of ingenuity.  For the first half hour this plays very much like a traditional horror movie such as 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', thankfully devoid of irony and clever smirks; this is horror at its most basic.  Indeed, there's an awful lot of moments that will make you jump up in your seat.  Despite being highly traditional though, there are several moments of genuine surprise here.  When the van bears down on the two teens it's actually very scary and the chamber made from dead bodies really makes the flesh creep.
However, once this threat is revealed as a demon a lot of the suspense rapidly disappears.  Although the special effects are impressive, nothing really takes away from the fact that what's been scaring the audience all this time has been an organ-harvesting demon.  Quite simply, this is silly, even if it is different.
Thankfully the young teen actors are very good indeed, and manage to bounce off each other incredibly well in the early comic scenes that they share.  What 'Jeepers Creepers' proved was that audiences have tired of the same smug horrors which quickly followed the ground-breaking 'Scream'.  This is back-to-basics stuff and cleverly creeps its audience out with implication rather than gore.  It's definitely one to watch, if not only for the fact that it is so different from a lot of other modern horror out there.",1018396800,,1814,4.895424836601308

 When Darry and his sister are terrorised on the road by a mini Duel truck, then see the driver of the truck dumping a body down a pipe, you actually care what happens next. Unfortunately, when the cloaked body dumper with the silly hat takes off after them and they manage to completely lose him with the brilliant plan of 'pulling to the side of the road', the warning bells start to chime.
 What follows is about an hour of absolute poo. Nothing anybody does or says from this point on makes any sense.
 The bad guy turns out to be an extra from Buffy who likes to suck on peoples' tongues. He comes after our two protagonists with the skill and intelligence of a lobster on smack.
 After some stupid running around and bad acting, Darry and Wendy (or whatever her name was) find themselves at a police station in the middle of nowhere that has a staff on duty of three hundred and forty, all with riot gear. When confronted by the tongue sucker, this heavily armed mob decides that the best course of action is to look at it for a while.

Dari and Trish are on their way home from college.  Of course, they are taking the long, out-of-the-way road where two people went missing over twenty years ago.  They are nearly run off the road by a beat-up, menacing truck that seems to have a life of its own.  Later, they see the occupant of the truck dumping something (a body?) into a large pipe.  He turns and watches them drive past.  This is the best shot in the movie!  This time they do get run off the road and Dari wants to go back and see what's in the pipe (idiot).  At the bottom Dari finds something disturbing (I'm sure you can guess), so they high tail it out of there to the nearest diner.  Dari gets a call from a psychic who tells him to watch out for the song Jeepers Creepers, `cause that's when HE'LL come.
We then get into the best horror sequence of 2001.  Someone notices the Creeper going through Dari's things out in the car.  Dari and Trish offer to take the police to the secret pipe but the Creeper attacks during and awful rock version of Jeepers Creepers (I'm sure you can guess what happens to the police escort).  It's the second best shot in the film!  Dari and Trish escape to Eileen Brennan's farm and shoot it out with the Creeper.  ""That ain't my scarecrow!"" .  Pretty cool sequence.
From there it's off to the police station and a big battle between the local P.D. and the Creeper.  I won't reveal the ending, but I will say it just seems like they cut out the entire third act.  It just ends.
Jeepers Creepers got a lot of negative reviews when it was released.  I can guess why.  Most critics don't know how to review a horror film.  It doesn't conform to the other rules of cinema.  All you have to do is tell a scary story and this one works more often than it doesn't.  The problem I have with it is; when it doesn't work, it REALLY doesn't work.  The Miss Cleo character is the most striking example.  She's put there to reveal necessary information to save Dari's and Trish's lives, but at a critical moment she refuses to help them because they might have a negative reaction to her information.  Huh?  Dari's reason for going down the pipe isn't really that good either.  Salva scripted and would do well to let a better screenwriter handle the reigns of Jeepers Creepers 2.  Yes, it's coming.
The DVD offers just about everything you could want.  Commentary.  Deleted Scenes.  Making ofs.

1656605,4,B00005RHGK,"Criteria for a horror movie should be different than for other films. They can lag in other areas, but if they deliver chills, shreiks, winces, gags (I mean the kind you make with your throat, not the kind you play on your friends) and a sense of, well, the creeps, that runs the whole film, you know you're on to something. ""Creepers"" does this and does it well. It's a short, well-crafted, brutally compact horror movie that uses storyline and atmosphere rather than buckets of the red stuff or an enormous kill-count to get your fear glands pumping. The story revolves around two sibling college students taking their ancient 1960s-era beater home on spring break via what looks to be the worlds longest and most desolate highway. On the way they spy a sinister-looking man dumping what appears to be bodies down a drainpipe, and here they commit their first ""Horror-Movie Mistake"" -- they investigate instead of getting the hell out of there. Turns out there is an extremely nasty surprise on the end of the pipe (think Sistine Chapel as designed by Dr. Lecter), but it's not until the two finally decide to split the scene -- and who wouldn't want to stay in a sewer pipe  -- that their troubles begin. Seems the mystery guy is on their scent (literally), and wants something from them, which he intends to remove without benefit of anesthetic. That's his gig, and he does it pretty well (hint: hiding in the police station will not help). ""Creepers"" is not a perfect film -- horror movies usually aren't -- but its flaws are the flaws of the genre and don't do much to detract from the tension. My biggest gripe is the design of the Creeper himself -- fully revealed, he is ugly but nothing you haven't seen trading barbs with Patrick Stewart on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" ; and the movie ends so abruptly and brutally that my initial reaction was that somebody had forgotten to put the last half hour in. But better an abrupt ending than a predicatble one, right? Simply put, ""Jeepers Creepers"" was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually creeped me out.

1656625,3,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers is one of the better recent horror films. If it's director and writer, Victor Salva, had been able to sustain the mood he created in the movie's first third, it might have been a great one. Shortly before production began, he was informed that the picture's budget had been slashed. The result was the cutting of the shooting schedule from forty-five days to thirty-one and a lot less money for the art department, which is the one that creates special effects. In light of these constrains, he probably did the best he could.
Trish and Darry [Gina Phillips and Justin Long] are returning home from college. Trish, who was recently dumped by her boyfriend, wants to take the long way home, a decision that takes the pair down a lonely country road. In the middle of nowhere, an ominous, rusty old truck roars up behind them and nearly causes them to crash. It finally passes them, but a few miles later, they spot it parked by an abandoned church. They see its occupant tossing something large wrapped in a blanket down a big drainpipe. In a decision which could only happen in this kind of movie, they go back to investigate. What they find there is scary enough, but what put it there is much more so. And it knows who they are.
Horror movies come in several forms and often spill over into other genres, such as the psychological thriller. Jeepers Creepers is in the old-fashioned monster movie category, with shades of the occult. It's a cut above most recent efforts of this type. The music is quite atmospheric, and the photography and lighting are very professional. Salva knows how to set a scene up to maximize the effect on the audience.
Salva is a good film maker who needs to polish his scripts a little more. He does a really excellent job of making his main characters more interesting and believable than those we usually encounter in such fare, but this makes the dumb things they do seem particularly unlikely. Still, I liked Trish and Darry more than most horror movie main characters. After Darry sees what lies at the bottom of of that drain pipe, he goes into shock. I think this is a much more likely reaction than the emotionally dead, macho reaction you usually see.
Justin Long and Gina Phillips are quite good. Many actors seem to get their starts in horror movies. Jack Nicholson comes to mind. You can often spot the good ones, because they consistently give a fine performance whether the material demands it or not.
Some people don't like horror movies. For those who enjoy them, this is a good choice, especially considering how thin the selection has been recently.",1015718400,4,2614,4.672451193058568
1656626,4,B00005RHGK,"It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this scary.  Most of the ""horror"" movies of the last 20 years or so have been the teen slasher films, which turned into the jokes of the scream series.  John Carpenter had the masterpiece in Halloween, but I would classify what he's done since as more science fiction.  And then there are the psycological thrillers, like ""What Lies Beneath"", which have their moments but hold back on the gore.
""Jeepers Creepers"" has it all.  There is no holding back on the gore.  When the creature starts eating a victim's tongue, while still attached to the head, it doesn't get any better than that.  We get close-ups of victim's stiched-up bodies.  And the final scene would make Buffalo Bill proud.
Where it excels, though, is atmosphere and tension.  I remember that the plot of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was not that great, but the setting of the house in that movie was as creepy as it got.  ""Jeepers Creepers"" goes beyond this.  We see that something awful is probably at the monster's hangout.  We spend time debating whether to enter it's confines.  When we finally get to see it, the buildup pays off big-time.  It would be hard to design a scarier environment than what Justin Long falls into.
The only reason that I don't give it five stars is explained in the movie itself.  Most people, after seeing the setup, would high-tail it out as fast as possible, and let the authorities take over.  But our hero has to not only go back to the scene, but literally stick his nose into it.  His more logical sister tells him that this is the typical stupid thing that people do in horror movies, and she's right.
But then, we wouldn't be treated with what follows.",1015545600,7,1701,4.564356435643564

Anyways, the movie Jeepers Creepers, is about two kids on their way back home from college, Darry and Trish.  But when then unexpectedly come across a mysterious pipe out in the middle of no where, that is next to an old abandond church.  When  the teens drive by, they notice a strange guy dropping *dead* bodies into the pipe covered with blood stains.
After about five minutes into the film, we see an excellent dull moment with the Old Truck and the kids.  The soundtrack and camera angles are so wonderful well done, that it sent chills up and down my spine.
Victor Salva is a wonderful director who knows what he's doing, and has casted a brilliant cast.
I'm proud of this movie for several reasons,
1.) It sticks to it's genre.
2.) You don't see too many horror flicks that stick with it's genre.

I won't bore you with another synopsis, since you can pick that up from many of the previous reviews, but this film is best if you don't know anything about it anyway.
I saw ""Jeepers Creepers"" on the shelf at the video store and was certain from the title that it would be a dismal attempt at a horror flick.  Nevertheless, I went to the effort of picking up the sleeve to check the reviews.  Clive Barker found this film scary?!?  Instant chill up the spine.  If this film made an impression on the virtuoso who brought us ""Night Breed"", it has to be worthy of a viewing.
Sure, the usual, ""Why in God's name are you not running away?"" scenario plays repeatedly in this slick number, but the answer as always is that the movie would have been fifteen minutes long if the protagonists did a quick fade!  As it turns out, given the nature of the baddie in this one, it may not have done the kids any good to run at any point...

The movie is a brother and sister relationship (Trish, Gina Philips, and Darry, Justin Long) which makes this movie even better to understand.  This movie has automatic suspence with it starting out with terror in the first 5 minutes.
It starts out with Trish and Darry taking the long way home which turns into a nightmare.  They spot a shabby looking man dumping bodies down a sewer pipe in the back of an old church.  Darry being as curious as he is turns back to see if there were any survivers, not knowing the horror that lies at the end, or even the horror that comes with seeing what he has.
It's a chase through the whole movie with this goulish creature and these two teens.  I would have to say Justin Long did a great job on acting, he makes the movie worth seeing.

Slow down and watch every minute, even if you know you shouldn't.  Come on we are all guilty of watching someone elses pain and get some sort of pleasure from it.
Problem w/ other reviews that I've seen, and this is probably the main point.  It seems that the majority are upset that the movie doesn't explain the Why JC is out there killing people, where did JC come from, etc...
Do we NEED an explanation?  That is one of the things I liked about this movie.  Come on people, didn't you love Hellraiser when you didn't know where PinHead originated from?  Jason from Friday 13th, isn't better to know that he isn't a superior human w/ the ability to heal his body rapidly?
To me, almost every horror film the first episode starts out wonderful but then sequel tries to ""explain"" the origins and it turns out to be worse and make the film 100% unbeleiveable.  Remember Highlander?  Wasn't it great NOT knowing where they originated from and that the Highlanders have been here amongst us fighting their war?  Then we are told they are space aliens sent to Earth for protection?  Really, did I NEED to know that?
Why must we know everything?  So what if we don't know much about JC.  That is the wonderful part of this movie, it leads one to want more, to sit through and wait for the next bit.  I do not need someone making up a past, feeding me a history, I don't care for that, if I want that, I'll watch a soap opera...

1656655,4,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers (Victor Salva, 2001)

I think that, with the arguable exception of Battlefield Earth, I haven't heard so much negative press about a movie in the past decade as I did about  this one. No idea why. This is one of the better horror movies to come out of Hollywood in quite a while, and Victor Salva has finally lived up to the promise that's kept Hollywood allowing him to make bad movies on a fairly  regular basis for the past decade and a half.

The story opens with a brother and sister team, Derry (Justin Long, from the TV series Ed) and Trish (Gina Phillips, who recently had a turn on Boston  Public and shows up next year in The Anarchist's Cookbook), driving across the state on their way home from college for spring break. On a secluded stretch of highway, a strange truck menaces them before roaring past. A few miles  down the road, they see the truck's driver dumping something that looks suspiciously like a body wrapped in a sheet down a large pipe, and after he drives away they stop to investigate. Complications ensue.

The movie's probably not going to win any awards for its acting, writing, or cinematography, all of which fall into the slightly-above-average category.  But then, this isn't a movie with Oscar aspirations anyway. It's supposed to be a fast-paced slick little horror film, and that's what it is. Salva achieves the right balance between showing the nastiness and cutting away to let  suggestion do the work, and also uses the suggestion technique with his bad guy most of the time (something that hasn't been seen too much in films for a while). Add in a Miss Cleo-esque psychic (Patricia Belcher), a few hick cops who  actually break stereotype a few times, and a fun bad guy (Jonathan Breck, from the painfully bad film Spiders), and you've got a fine little flick. *** ",1014681600,26,1827,4.660436137071651

1656657,1,B00005RHGK,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Most people watch movies twice because they are good, I watched it twice because I couldn't believe it was that bad. Why this movie was a success in the box office is beyond me. Why is it bad, let me explain.
The basic premise of the movie is: brother and sister coming home from college, they almost get run off the road by what turns out to be the title character. After investigating the supposed lair of this creature, they go from the hunting to the hunted. Now that the backdrop is out of the way let me tell you why I hated this film. The first half-hour of the movie is real dry, you'll be scratching your head asking yourself,""this is the suspense they were talking about on the back of the box?"" I don't call almost getting run down suspenseful. I don't ask for characters in horror movies to be smart. I know they have to be somewhat retarded to make the story work but this is going far and beyond the call of duty with these two.
My main gripe with the film is that it doesn't explain anything. I don't even think the film's makers predicted it would be successful and spawn a sequel ... I think the film makers realized that people wanted a good monster flick, so they threw this together just to cash in. You never find out what the creature is, where it came from, why it does the thing that it does, why this woman has the psychic ability to know what it is about to do. There are plenty of questions you can think of during the course of this movie. Besides the lack of character development, this movie isn't really scary at all. They try to force scenes in there to make you jump, it's to predictable though. I thought this would be a movie that would get my wife jumping, instead she got bored to death and went to play Boggle. I will give JC this though, the ending rather surprised me, if only the rest of the movie was thought out like the ending.
Look, I'm pretty picky. Some people need nor plot or character development to enjoy a movie. Hey it is a horror movie, its only supposed to scare you and make you jump(even though it didn't). Give it a try if you have a rent one get one free card, but I would suggest renting a good thriller such as SE7EN and calling it a day.",1014595200,2,2241,4.2018561484918795

I know the writer/director wanted to stick to the basics but we as an audience have grown use to origins of the killer. Why does he kill? Where did he come from? How can you kill him? This movie doesn't say at all.
But the most damaging parts in the movie was the dumb mistakes that the 2 main characters made. People in the theater literally couldn't take it anymore and started to leave. Me, i stayed because the monster in the movie is the coolest i've seen since Freddy Krueger. Not to spoil the movie but, one of the dumb mistakes was: the brother and sister are riding in the car as a police officer escorts them out of town, the ""Creeper"" lands on top of the police car and slices his head off. When the 2 main characters see the severed head they stop and check to see if the officer is alive. At this point i'm like ""DRIVE AWAY IDIOT"" then the ""Creeper gets out of the car, grabs the severed head and eats the tongue. While all of this is going on, THEY STILL STAND THERE?!!!?

My Opinion:  I liked JC and found it to be entertaining. Sure it has some plot holes and fits easily into the teen horror genre, but isn't that what you wanted if you are renting or buying this movie? I liked the brother sister twist. Usually you have the boyfriend girl friend thing going on. Here we have a stronger sibling bond. It makes for some different points of view and situations. I thought Justin Long did a great job. I like him on the Ed TV show and it was cool to see him here. Gina Philips was also pretty good and she wasn't bad to look at. The Creeper was a cool character. They gave him a reason for what he did. There is also a bit of subterfuge as to what the Creeper is really after. When we find out what he really is I was a bit disappointed, but I got over it. In the end I was entertained and glad I rented it.

Nightmare On Elm Street, Silence Of The Lambs, Creature From The Black Lagoon and even Aliens are inspirations for this fine horror outing.  That's not to say that it is better than all of those.  But you'll be reminded of these and other similar good horror movies such as Pumpkinhead.  Excellent acting (Gina is a honey!), writing, special effects and visually striking overall.  I was on the edge of my seat through most of it.  Unless you are only into hardcore or if you are somewhat squeemish you'll find a lot to like.  If there are any weaknesses it can be blamed on budget limitations.  The filmmakers should be happy with the final results (the commentary supports that).  Very spooky.  Love the unpredictable ending (commentary mentions some viewers disappointment with the ending...not me).  Most moviemakers would have ended it differently.  I'm really hoping for Jeepers Creepers 2.  There are some ideas that are not fully explored; again, because of budget constaints.  I'd like a bit more humor (like Nightmare on Elm Street) but it was a smart move to keep the Creeper demon silent and mostly humorless.  Freddie he ain't.  And that's a good thing.  Another strength is the main characters are brother-sister and not boyfriend-girlfriend.  Watch and you'll discover way this works so well.  What I don't understand is why this isn't done more.
I rented mine but will probably buy it here when the price drops (perfect for my month long October horror movie marathon).  The DVD picture and sound are both excellent.  It's a doublesided disc with movie on one side and lots of extras on the other.  It has a nice selection of deleted scenes.  Dig that alternate ending!  Not to give anything away, but in that final shot I would've liked to see him perched instead of sitting on a stool.  It begs the question Is He A Demon Or Something From This World?  He looks a little too much like Freddie Kruger at times.  But with that axe he has a reaper-thing going.  To give credit where credit is due, there is a terrific scene near the end against a window that really establishes this as a demon removed from the others.  I'll just say ""face wings"".  Also, the commentary mentions that it ""steals clothes from it's victoms over the years"".  Very eery stuff.  Don't pass over the documentary (done just for the dvd) it's very good; showing all the production steps.  Future movie makers should use this as a reference.

At times, I laughed at the genuinely (and intentional) comic portions, but other than some bodies and some blood, there were no disturbing themes in this film.
The main characters in horror films, the ""heroes,"" are generally likable in some form or fashion. Not so, here. I wanted this pair of siblings to die so horribly, especially the sister, who was not likable in the least. The characterization is weak enough on the main characters, so when they start introducing auxiliary characters... they are so weak and one-dimensional that I didn't even want them on the screen.
As for the creature... all I have to say is: Stephen King's ""It.""
Last, but certainly not least... ahh, the use of the song ""Jeepers Creepers."" I keep hearing how this song is used to ""chilling"" and ""horrifying"" effect. Honestly, if anything, it is used to a darkly comedic effect.

1656758,2,B00005RHGK,"While ""Jeepers Creepers"" is obviously in the hands of a skilled writer/director (Victor Salva), one can't help but feel an odd sense of deja vu when watching the film play out. The set up, or the film's first 30 minutes, is terrific. The resolution however, is typical. It's odd this film would have received such glowing reviews from the nation's critics, though one suspects the presence of Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios to be a factor. ""If they made it, then it has to be good!"" It's really not.
Two siblings returning home from college decide to take a detour down a lonely country highway. We know this wisecracking pair, a brother and sister, are going to encounter horror, since this is a horror film. But the way they encounter the horror, in the form of an ominous demon with a taste for human flesh, is always suspenseful and surprising. From church basements to rooms littered with dead bodies, this unlucky pair is in for a nightmare of terrifying proportions.
Unfortunately for the viewer, the nightmare is far too reminiscent of ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and, most noticeably, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" And don't forget to throw in ""Duel"" for good measure, as this demon prefers a juiced up truck bearing what seems to be one heck of a loud fog horn.
While the kids in this film undoubtedly make some of the stupidest mistakes in the history of horror films (returning to scenes of crimes, observing crimes rather than running), I was never really distracted by this. I also appreciated the fact that beautiful young woman were never the victims in this film. In ""Jeepers Creepers,"" men seemed to be suffering far grislier fates.
What bothered me was an especially abrupt ending at the police station, a lack of explanation for why this demon was scooping up victims off the highways of Florida and the overall geekiness of Justin Long as the brother (though I think this was intentional). In fact, Mr. Long irritated me so much that the creepy conclusion amused me more than anything else.
I thought Gina Philips as the sister was terrific and hope to see her again in the sequel, or perhaps a better film. Her performance was natural and commanding. It was perhaps the best aspect of ""Jeepers Creepers.""
As for the demon, well, been there done that. It certainly is not something I would want to meet in a dark alley (or on a lonely highway), but one can't help but wonder if this is yet another attempt by moviemakers to produce a title monster followed by an endless line of bad sequels.",1011744000,,2539,4.7207207207207205

I really, I really hope the ending was made like this because there is going to be a sequel.. I mean-what's the point of an ending like that if you don't make a sequel?

If he's some type of animal-how can he whistle? Who really is Jezelle Gay Hartman? There were a lot of questions that unanswered at the end of the movie-and that's another reason the movie [was bad].

1656760,1,B00005RHGK,"There is a method of shooting horror films where certain elements are masked in the shadows and what you don't see can be more terrifying that what you do--this movie didn't use this technique. I guess the director thought this movie would be even scarier if you couldn't see anything at all. An innovative solution, but I think it came up a little short.
Truly good movies have another element called pacing. That's where the pace of the movie slows down to deliver character and plot information, then speeds up to send you racing through action sequences. So at the end of the movie you feel well informed and entertained. They elected not to do this in this movie as well. It starts off nice and slow with the main characters establishing themselves, that drags on a bit too long, and then they inexplicably reversed the equation with the action sequences being painfully slow, and rushing through any informative scenes. So at the end of the movie if felt uninformed and irritated.
Foreshadowing is another method good stories use to make you anticipate what is going to happen later in the movie without giving it away, so once it is revealed everything clicks into place and you have all the satisfaction of seeing the last piece of the puzzle fit into place and you really knew what it was the whole time, but couldn't quite put your finger on it. The title of this movie contains such a device, although it was utilized with all the finesse and understanding of a junior-highschool remedial english student. They attempted to use it in two different methods (both of which are valid) each of which undermined the other, and either one on its own would still be considered half-baked.
I could go on and on, but I've already wasted more time than I care to on this wasteland of a movie. Was there even a script? It just seems like they were shooting by the seat-of -there-pants. As each scene drags on I can practically hear Ed Wood barking directions from off-camera.

When I rented Jeepers Creepers, I had in mind that I was going to get exactly the opposite of that.  I was let on to believe that it was going to be terrifying.  It wasn't.
The first 30 minutes gave me some hope though.  The Creep, as I like to call the monster, played a crazed maniac in an old, unexpectedly powerful vehicle that tries and run the main characters off the road.  It was fresh and very entertaining.  But, after all that was done, and the Creep made his first appearance in costume, the film spiraled down hill.
The one problem I have with most horror films these days is that they are overloaded with cliches.  And Jeepers Creepers was beyond overloaded with them.  There were your typical stupid main characters that do their stupid things and say those stupid lines.  Nobody in their right mind would even consider doing some of things they did.
And the believability of some parts was stretching it a bit.  Would a county in the middle of no where have a police force the size of Manhattan?  I don't think so.  Things like that just really took its toll on the movie.
Jeepers Creepers really wasn't a terrible film, but it took on all the features that it was expected to in a horror movie.[...].  3 Stars",1011484800,,1448,4.480916030534351
1656794,2,B00005RHGK,"okay???? I think this movie probably deserves 2 1/2 *'s if THAT many I mean the actors were really good! But their characters were the STUPIDEST people I ever seen I mean I never used the word stupidest but I think if any this is the best time to use it. The first few minutes the two kids are driving home and everything starts off pretty good. Their characters were pretty interesting y'know. But THEN this big ugly monster truck (with the license plate that says ""beatingu"") tries to run them over. At this point Im kinda laughing at their reactions. So the truck finally leaves after driving them into a field. A little after they start to drive again. SO while their driving they spot the truck beside a creepy lookin house and see some weird guy in a big coat dumping bodies in a pipe. AFTER they intelligently pass, it is then that Darry starts suggesting that they go back. Now at this point Im thinking okay this guy has obviously developed some brain disorders after their little truck incident from earlier! I mean c'mon if you seen this guy in a coat STUFFING these bodies into a PIPE and these bodies are completely wrapped in sheets NOT to mention drenched with blood stains, would it ever cross your mind that they might still be alive???? I think not, NOT if you had some sense. BUT somehow this Darry person convinces his sister that their only going to take a look....Yea right. Well they go to this pipe thing ----fast forward----- Well he ends up in the dang pipe of course. Now Im thinking that the sister will now go get help BUT instead shes waiting out on the road in front of this crazy mans house to flag down a car. Well you know where Im going with this to make this long version short basically this monster guy shape thing chases them all through the night. This movie definately had me aggravated ALL the way through. I mean this movie definately had the typical stupid horror movie teens in it. But it deserves 2 1/2 stars. I give one star for the actors who did a great job although for the WRONG movie. I give one star for the old lady they come across in the middle of the movie. Now SHE definately had the most sense out of all. And when she grabbed that shotgun I laughed so hard I almost cried I mean it was hysterical. And finally I give 1/2 stars to the moviue itself because no matter how STUPID the characters came to be,this movie really had the feel of a HORROR movie. I mean it's the kind to give you nightmares for weeks...well more on the lines of days! But have you ever seen a movie that you just wanted to jump in kill the characters and save the villian some troube well this is definately one of those!",1011398400,,2654,4.331325301204819

1656853,5,B00005RHGK,"JEEPERS CREEPERS

(USA/Germany - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

Adding its own particular twist to the currently popular teen-horror cycle, JEEPERS CREEPERS - the sleeper hit of 2001, co-produced by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios - demonstrates how a fairly conventional narrative can be enhanced by the kind of loving care and attention to detail exhibited here by writer-director Victor Salva. His clever, attentive script describes the terrifying experiences of teenage siblings Trish and Darry (played with exceptional warmth and sincerity by attractive newcomers Gina Philips and Justin Long) who are driving home from college when they're terrorized by a demonic creature which initially runs them off a lonely country road. After stumbling into the monster's lair and uncovering it's ghastly secrets (a genuinely heart-stopping set-piece), the kids flee from the monster's wrath, only to be warned by a terrified psychic (an ultra-creepy performance by Patricia Belcher) that the creature has targeted them for a particular reason and won't let them go... ever.

From the dark-hearted drama of NATURE OF THE BEAST (1994) and RITES OF PASSAGE (1998) to the spiritual uplift of POWDER (1995), Salva has always demonstrated a willingness to challenge the conventions of mainstream cinema by thwarting audience expectations at every turn, and JEEPERS CREEPERS is no exception. An avowed fan of old-time monster movies, the director has marshalled his considerable creative resources to produce an equally old-fashioned creature feature, updated for modern sensibilities and characterized by jump-out-of-your-seat thrills, a well-developed sense of irony, and plenty of heart and soul. To top it all off, there's also a pretty impressive monster - a combination of clever makeup, CGI effects, and a truly menacing performance by Jonathan Breck, buried beneath masses of latex and foam rubber.

With nods to an assortment of genre outings, especially DUEL (1971) - which the director happily acknowledges - the film maintains a breathless pace before culminating in a final showdown which capitalizes on the strong emotional undertow established during the opening sequences. In a commentary recorded for the film's original US DVD release, Salva mentioned that he was forced to cut twenty pages from this section of the script for budgetary reasons but, crucially, he doesn't mention what those missing pages contained. Perhaps he's saving them for the forthcoming sequel?

With fabulous, evocative production design by Steven Legler, and equally moody cinematography by frequent Salva collaborator Don E. FauntLeRoy, which transforms the central Florida locations into a Gothic, brooding 21st century dreamscape, the movie's relentless forward momentum allows just enough humor to offset the ultra-convincing trauma suffered by the principal characters as they pit their wits against a merciless force of supernatural horror. However, Salva's normally impeccable judgment is slightly compromised by an unwarranted, needlessly cruel postscript: Having staged a predictably lavish, crowd-pleasing finale that scales the heights of operatic tragedy, Salva chooses to close proceedings with a downbeat coda that's actually more depressing than horrific, and seems completely out of tune with the Big Fun Monster Movie that precedes it. It's the only significant flaw in an otherwise perfectly realized miniature.

1656858,2,B00005RHGK,"but the best way to watch this movie is to turn it off half way through. I know that no one reading this is actual going to turn it off in the middle of the movie...but if you want to walk away from this movie and not want to scream, break the tape or disc, and hope something very bad happens to the makers, shut it off at the point where the brother and sister enter the police station. So my review will consist of 2 parts; before this scene and after it.
The first hour has all the makings of an excellent, original, and scary movie that might give you nightmares for weeks. Horror movies in the past 5 years haven't really been scary at all, and most should be direct to video B movies. The acting is top notch. The characters are involving and you start to really care about them. The villain will give you the creeps, and even has a personality (whistles while he's throwing bodies in his truck). There are some ""do NOT do this in a horror movie"" instances that occur, but one can live with this. Jeepers Creepers appears to the best horror movie in a long time.
The second part of the movie, about the last 30 minutes, will leave you very mad. It seems as though they got bored with the movie and wanted to wrap it up quickly. There are some characters introduced for no reason (pyschic woman), gigantic holes in the story, and parts of the story that are never explained (bodies in the church basement, why haven't they decomposed, and why does he return every 23 years). After the last scene and the screen goes black, you are thinking (you would bet money on it) that the movie is not over. I watched a few minutes of the credits just to make sure, plus I was in shock on how bad the movie ended.
Now after reading this review, I know you'll watch the whole movie, but you'll ask yourself ""why didn't I listen to that guy and turn it off half way through?"". This is the first review I have ever written. I've seen movies that were bad and just not care to write one, but I feel cheated from this movie. I love horror movies, them being my favorite genre (sci-fi's my 2nd favorite). I hated that this movie stunk. Would someone please make a good horror movie?!!",1010793600,5,2172,4.274271844660194

Someone even said this movie isn't a satire, if thats true, why does the girl say ""you know that part in horror movies when someone does somethign really stupid and everyone hates him for it, this is it"" Could you be anymore obvious and self-knowing? That line alone, totally blows whatever fictional world they want you in. From that moment on you KNOW this will be nothing more then typical horror dribble.
The Creeper is NOT scary, not even that ugly. His form is just not surprising, and falls short of a vampire bat wannabe.
The kill scenes are non-existant with little to no blood. Theirs no psychological thrills because everything is painted right in front of you. The use of the song is silly but serves some kinda purpose but holds no candle to freddy's song.
The characters are acted as well as they can be, but they have nothing to work with. All they do is run and get scared. Its so short that literally by the end, not much of anything has happened.

1656873,2,B00005RHGK,"The shame is, the movie was doing fairly well with me for the first 1/2 or so, but then started going tradgically wrong!
The movie pretty much starts with a good chase scene, that really does raise some goosebumps.
The movie then goes into a bunch of classic horror movie cliches, and even acknowledges the fact.  The sister says something to her brother about how there is a point in all horror movies where someone does something stupid, and that's what he was doing.  Would have been funny in Scream, but not here where they weren't trying to be a spoof.  The scenes in the church basement were disturbing enough to be scary, but then the movie turned into a really, really bad made-for-tv movie.
You never really care about the main characters in the movie.  You never really care about the monster, or how or why he exists.  One line in the entire movie tries to explain The Creeper.  One line?  To explain a flesh eating monster who can't be stopped?  Um, alright.
The performances were terrible.
I am a fan (not a big fan, but a fan) of the horror movie genre.  What makes them fun is being scared, being grossed out, and believing (if even slightly) in what is going on in the film.  You get none of the above in this one in the second half.  The first half was decent (hence the two stars) but the second half ruins any of the good they did earlier in the film.  The end was pathetic, but I was at least glad it was finally over.
I remember when this came out, I was thinking that it would be a good rental.  It wasn't even worth the rental fee.

1656874,3,B00005RHGK,"Let me apologize first by stating that I am one of those people that wants there to be resolution at the end of a movie.  I want to know what the hell is going on and why.  There is one exception to that and that would be Blair Witch Project.  Unfortunately, this movie does not supply me with any useful information about what and why everything is happening.  I also want a movie to deliver when it claims to have the scariest opening sequence and the gutsiest ending.  This movie does not deliver on either one of those claims.  If simply leaving the movie unfinished and open at the end is gutsy, then I say NO to gutsy endings.  And if a movie does not have an opening sequence scarier than Scream or doesnt even come close, then don't make the claim that it is the scariest.  On the other hand, this movie had so much promise, it did have me scared, it did have me nervous and on the edge of my seat.  That is until the ending came.  I was so furious and angry that it made me hate the movie.  Also, there was really nothing that frightening about the monster.  If they wanted to leave something to the imagination, they should have let us imagine him.  My own image would have been far more frightening than him/it or whatever it is.  And what the hell is it anyway?  Not knowing what it is or what and why it is doing evil things does not scare me, it only aggravates me and ticks me off.  Loose ends just don't work and only make it seem that the person directing or producing is just sequel hungry.  Ugh!!!!!  Well, that's what I think and feel about this movie that had such promise and no delivery of the goods that we so desperately seek in horror/scary movies.  But I guess once one has seen Scream, all others pale in comparison.  Scream is a hard act to follow and I am sure everyone knows this.

It seemed as if this one would be different from your usual slasher stuff, I really expected to see a piece of psychological horror. But it's not. I was so dissapointed when I left the cinema. Though not very original (it reminded me very often of ""Duell"" and ""Joyride""), the movie began quite promising, there are some witty dialogues, and you get to know the two protagonists better than it's usual for scary movies, Gina Phillips's and Justin Long's acting was also good. But that's only the first half of the trip. After some great (really great!) psychological shock moments, you get to see the villain and after seeing him it all gets very ridiculous, it seemed to me as if I'm seeing a really bad unaired episode of ""Buffy-The Vampire Slayer"". The atmosphere of silent terror gets destroyed by this cheap, cheap, cheap monster make up. It's the most ridiculous monster I've ever seen. It's not scary at all! And so is the ending, though it's surprisingly pessimistic, it's not satisfying at all. The movie just stops...the ending just doesn't feel right. I don't have anything against pessimistic and shocking endings, but hello! This ending just looked like they had not enough money to bring the movie to an end!
Though all in all disappointing, this movie is worth a watch (rent it first), the first half is one of the finest in modern teen horror history. This one could have been so much better, why do they always have to show the monster?<BR.....",1010620800,,1588,4.736462093862816
1656876,5,B00005RHGK,"This movie is great, there is nothing wrong with it. Yes it has a story and a weird somewhat plot, its not too violent, yet in my opinion very scary. People today who are expecting this to be like friday the 13th,exorcist,scream, ect. will be dissapointed because it isnt. It is even way better then that, because this in my opinion is one of the most original horror stories ever especially the lay out of the characters. The actors are excellent, you can really feel their fear in this film. I mean just imagine seeing a creature like the one in this movie in real life, no matter what you say it would be terrifying. Anyone who doesnt like this movie, thinks its bad whatever, well this just isn't your type of film not because you thought it was a waste of time but because you didn't watch it like you shouldve and taken time to sit and try to get into it. I saw this movie 4 times in the theatre and the whole time the entire audience was quite, including the sometimes annoying youth. All eyes and ears need to be focused on this movie the whole time or you will lose it and not get it whats going on so of course it would seem like an odd show to you. And anyone who loves horror movies this has got to be a for you it is a true horror movie, and in a way is very realistic maybe not the creature but just the layout, the timing and the fear in these people that go through all this. Enjoy the movie if you enjoy roller coaster rides, and there is no point to ruin the ending but that is the only bad thing about this film is the ending but its still worth it, and there will be a sequel, can you say vengeance? lets hope so, anyway get this movie its outstanding.",1010534400,2,1672,4.116207951070336

But anyways when this DvD came out on release day I rushed and got me one and took it home. And before I started to open up the factory seal on it,,,, one of my buddies called me and told me to ""STOP"" and not open it becasue it would be the worste [price]spent on any DvD. He recommended me to rent it before I open my DvD. So me and my dumb self had to listen to him,... so I rushed over to my local BlockBuster and got me one and rushed home and watched it.
All I have to say is WOW!!!! This movie was pretty creepy and I really enjoyed this flick. I think that majority of people why they did not like it because there are some things that can throw you off and ask certin questions. For Example:
1). Where did this monster come from?
2). Why did this monster kill people and for what reason??
but I truly did understand this movie. infact its a keeper for a true horror movie collectors.
I have to say please buy it and if you don't got the cash to own it.. please rent it and I can promise you you will enjoy this horror of an thriller movie!!! Jeepers ... creepers,,, where you get them peepers  (just remember this song)  :)  !!!!",1010534400,,1269,4.007905138339921
1656878,1,B00005RHGK,"I don't particularly go for these teenage horror films that have been popping up ever since SCREAM came out. Now don't get me wrong, I like horror films, but my taste lies more in the vicinity of Dario Argento, George Romero, Clive Barker, and Luci Fulci. But I sat down to see JEEPERS CREEPERS with an open heart, and the film started out pretty good. The story goes as follows; The two siblings, Trish and Darry, are on their way home to visir their parents, on a college break, when they are suddenly harassed by an eerie looking old van, whilst driving along a deserted stretch of American highway. It's all very much like THE HITCHER. After a short while the van drives on and dissapears, until Trish and Darry comes across it again, this time parked in front of an abandoned church. As they drive by, they see a person dumping what appears to be bodies wrapped in white sheet into a pipe in the ground. Unfortunetaly, the person also spots Trish and Darry; Another car chase follows. Trish and Darry manages to escape again, but this time Darry gets the brilliant idea that they should backtrack and see if anybody needs help. Valiant, sure, but stupid. ""Haven't you watched enough horror movies?"" Trish asks Darry, and it's bad luck for Darry that he obviously hasn't, because we all know what Darry doesn't; Never, ever, under any circustance, go back... So far the film is fairly exciting. There's even some pretty nice camera work to behold. But it doesn't take long before the plot pretty much skyrockets off the face of the planet. Now this is okey if you can maintain credibility, but JEEPERS CREEPERS certainly can't. Things become ridiculous, and when stuff gets ridiculous they seize to be scary. I started out thinking that ""boy would this be creepy if it happened to me,"" and I ended up thinking ""what a totally awful film this is,""",1010534400,,1850,4.6432926829268295

This Francis Ford Coppola executive produced movie is a one and a half hour full of pretty good entertainment, if you don't expect much from horror movies.  I rented this movie yesterday and I actually thought it was funny.  The dialogue is laughable, and the plot is so predictable, but I guess it was what I expected from a horror movie.  If you buy this, you will be disappointed.  This is worth a rental to pass the time.  And it is kind of amusing.  But don't go into this movie expecting a lot of scares.  Sure, there is a considerable amount of violence, but it is not scary.  The movie has a good amount of suspense, and it was different from most horror flicks.  The killer was a monster.  Sort of bat-like.  I won't tell you the ending, but don't expect some wonderful ending. If you want a really good horror movie, buy Halloween.

1656922,5,B00005RHGK,"I just had to drop an interjection here. Sure in a cinema stuffed with wannabe 'thrillers' it's easy for a few to get lost in the dust. But don't count JEEPERS CREEPERS out. Sure, fans of the 'slash-and-kill-yuppies-college-kids' type of movies will definately be disappointed. This type of thriller would better cater to fans of more 'psychological thrillers' where subtle visuals and eerie camera techniques drive the fear instead of 'slash-happy' action -- like Dean Koontz's ""PHANTOMS"", and many video games like the Resident Evils and Silent Hill.
I think it was great the way the 'villian' was NOT some deranged boyfriend or a lonely shop owner -- the 'Scooby Doo' villian syndrome is WAY overplayed to the point that everyone who sits down to watch a thriller immediately starts taking notes on the bit-part characters near the beginning to decipher who the bad guy ahead of time.

You will also notice complaints about dialogue and plot threads which are never fully explained.  Aside from these drawbacks, Jeepers Creepers has some very creepy moments and successfully creates an atmosphere of dread.  The creature is done well.  While there are no real surprises, the results are still shocking.  From the mural on the ceiling of dead victims to the end sequence.  I will not deny the film provided some scares but perhaps the most disturbing element is how one might interpret this film. When you review the director's filmography, you will note that there is a gap between pictures.  This gap is when the director was serving time for child molestation.  Knowing this, and watching this film will make you shudder even more.  With this piece of information, you will find a multitude of disturbing interpretations.

The use of shock tactics was excellent and the man who preys on these 2 teens is terrifying...up until one point. The illusion of a scary old guy was shattered when he suddenly has wings and a scaly body. I think this killed the terror. The use of effects made the guy less scary.

1656926,5,B00005RHGK,"I've read numerous reviews on Jeepers Creepers with polar opposite appraisals and ratings.
Surprisingly, some ""bottom-of-the-barrel"" judgements contain such in-depth and thorough analysis that bad movies could unlikely be worth of.
Perhaps the people may have disliked the movie so much that they could hardly deny themselves a pleasure of trampling it to dust.
No doubt the script has its loopholes and drawbacks.
However I believe these mostly are for the sake of sustaining its headlong momentum.
Some illogical and imprudent moves of the kids indeed contradict with the instinct of self-preservation.
But both leads look credible enough, and some minor flaws in their motivation could be excused for curiosity.
Anyway all this falls into a pattern of the genre.
What else did you expect of a horror movie? If you hate the very idea of checking up the sewer pipe with two inquisitive (and good Samaritan) kids - don't waste your time and keep your bucks intact.
Some reviewers are giggling at the habit of the flying creature to drive a truck - well, how on earth is the guy supposed to dump all these bodies - do you think he should transport them all by air?
Then why aren't you amazed that the Creeper crawls along the wall?
After all, why noone is surprised with the presence of demonic power in the movie - ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T EXIST!!!
A REAL horror movie buff must have learnt to disengage oneself from such insignificances.
I'm a horror film addict and I think that real life beyond the doorway is much more frightening than the scariest movie.
It's rather hard to devise something new and fresh which could satisfy and petrify the experienced viewer to the bone.
But I didn't find so much resemblance with some earlier classic movies as many counted.
Some cliche are purely unintentional - the nearly century-long hystory of horror movies has brought about so many different nasty characters - it could be a hell of a job to offer something brand new and refreshing to dedicated moviegoers. (I myself have found some similarities of the creature with J.P.Ouellette's Unnamable rather than with Terminator or Jason Voorhees - but who cares).
My overall impression of this particular film - this is truly horrifying movie with a plenty of chilling moments and deserves a good rating.
Not so many films of the last decade made me shiver like Jeepers Creepers did.
To my opinion this one has major essential elements of a good horror movie - strong acting, impetuous pace, nice camerawork, decent FX, creepy score, believable dialogue and sense of humor and proportion.
If you're looking for an extensive character study or logical motivations - try Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment instead.
P.S. MGM has prepared a nice DVD package with really good DD5.1 sound scheme - those voices from the church's cellar reproduced from the rear speakers have knocked my socks off.",1010448000,,2877,4.934020618556701

In horror movies you have to have a person that does something so stupid that the monster comes after them or else there wouldnt be any point to it.  I just don't understand you so called ""horror experts"" you expect every movie to be halloween or the exorcist.

1656943,5,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers is my favorite kind of horror film: thrilling, unique and intense.
This is no sleepy Misery or Shining type of horror film that has to pre-bake for an hour before it really starts cookin'. It puts you on the edge of your seat in the first 3 minutes and doesn't let you settle back for the next 90 minutes. Consider it action/horror.
Interestingly, this film gave me the same feeling that the original Terminator did when I saw it for the first time in 1985.
What makes Jeepers Creepers so suspenseful to watch is that you can't figure out what the ""individual"" doing all the killing actually IS, yet alone his reason for doing it until perhaps the last 20 minutes. It's hard to tell what on earth is going on at times, yet the storyline is strong and doesn't meander through misplaced scenes with unneccessary characters (like a lot of horror movies tend to do).
I absolutely loved this film.
A word of warning, however. If you buy this movie expecting to be blow away by all-the-latest in special effects, you WILL be disappointed. This is not a blockbuster action feature like the Mummy or Tomb Raider. I say this because I know those who don't appreciate the horror genre or only appreciate gory, bore-horror will see it and say, ""You know, the seen with all the bodies was just too cheesy for me. I mean, they didn't even look real. This was no Nightmare on Elm Street Dream Bandit Part 9, I'll tell you that much.""

It starts off very well, but after the scene in which we see the man put two bodies down a large pipe, it goes drastically downhill.

Other problems with this movie:
1. Our demonic creature, invincible--even invulnerable--and scary, can fly...yes, FLY...yet feels compelled to drive (yes, DRIVE) around incognito in a truck stolen from the DUEL (nod to a good film by Spielberg) studio lot in a disguise that would have made DARKMAN say, ""Oh, please.""
2. Is this creature scary?
*Yes!*
After you?
*Oh, yes, please someone stop it!*
Is it eating a victim?
*Why, yes it is...let's watch, sis, whaddya say?*
Most people run when they have a chance, but not our ""static"" duo...they're going to watch every gruesome moment as our hero...um...demon begins to eat someone's head.
3. The scarecrow scene. Was there a point? Did the demon really feel compelled to use a ruse that was devised more to scare the audience then to serve any meaningful purpose within the story's context? Also, what was up with the CATS???? The movie was creepy enough without some deranged woman who attempts to be creepy, but is just downright eccentric and in need of better lighting for her house. Advice: use Yellow Pages.
4. Victims. Victims galore. Over 500 and counting in a deserted area. Did anyone ever think of looking? Even if they were all travelers, you think that the dragnet of law enforcement would sit and ponder, ""You know, those darned kids took the same route as the other 498 other missing cases in this darned area. Maybe we should ask that weird fellow at the abandoned building over yonder...seems kinda strange that there is a truck parked in front of it. *spitting and bell sound*""
5. Jeepers Creepers...where did you get those eyes...was this really meant to shock us at the end? Oh, the demon took the little fellow's eyes...what a surprise.
6. The CAR. Oh, that hurt the most. I could almost hear the director saying, ""Hey, Bob. This scene needs some tension. Whaddya think?"" Bob: ""Oh, I've got it!! How about making the car difficult to start?!? We haven't done that before!!"" (repeat 6 times -- but when it's not necessary, make sure the car starts just fine like when they decide to run over the demon). It was the first time that I can recall actually moaning out loud in a film every time I heard the engine grind.
With some rework and common sense, this story could have worked beautifully. It's also nice to see a horror story that serves to perpetuate itself by not making us wonder if the demon died, but to let the demon survive. But the arguing between the two main characters who somehow manage to develop an undying bond near the film's end, a pointless psychic, a creature that obviously has no need for disguise if it can survive being run over by a car several times, law enforcement that practices ""let's stay in a huddle so one grenade could take us out"" tactics, and so on, was enough to make me say, ""What was that?

I could think of half a dozen better endings than that and realised that the overall reaction of the rest of the audience was confusion aswell. It appears that the ideas just seemed to have run out because it stops too abruptly and doesn't supply the audience with a convincing conclusion. Then again, reality doesn't seem to be a big concern of the film-makers.
Granted, the purpose of many films is to entertain the audience and provide them with a situation to 'lose' themselves in for a few hours, but a bit of credibility goes a long way in helping a film be entertaining.
A few scenes did make me jump and some I couldn't even watch, but loads of films make me do this; it is only the really good ones that get me interested and leave me thinking. Sadly, Jeepers Creepers didn't do this for me and as much as I'd like to give this film a good rating, it only gets a weak 2.",1006387200,,1358,4.392857142857143

1656974,1,B00005RHGK,"I've grown up watching alot of horror films, so I'm used to the horror cliches:idiot teenagers,non-cooperative vehicles,useless side characters there for body count only ,just to name a few. With this film I found myself wanting the monster to kill the ""heroes"" within minutes. The ""heroes"" are so annoying that I, along with the theatre staff I was watching it with, wanted to kill them myself. Actually,by the end of the film we wanted to kill not only the director, but ourselves. I laugh at all the reviewers that compare this to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. That film has more going for it than a series of Jeepers Creepers films could ever garner. This has to be the only film I've ever watched that gave no background on the creature. Some would find that a little detail that would help a story along. Guess that wasn't necessary here. I did like the decapitation scene. Thats about it. Other than that, this film just stinks. If I could, I'd bribe the director to not make a sequel. If he does, please send it directly to video. Needless to say, I'm still waiting for a quality horror film to come to theatres..........waiting.",1005436800,,1136,4.685
1656975,3,B00005RHGK,"Obviously a low-budget film, Jeepers Creepers actually ends so suddenly that you get the feeling they must have run out of cash. Rather than the traditional story structure of beginning middle and end, writer-director Victor Salva seems to make do with the first two-thirds of that formula to craft allegedly ""the best US horror film in the last ten years"".
Not that Salva is a bad director. The first 30 minutes of this unassuming horror film is actually great stuff, which leaves me wondering if the original idea was for a 30 minute short piece which would have worked beautifully. Salva is not a hack, and his camera set-ups (lots of low angle shots during the car chases, some superb high-angle ones of the very atmospheric church, the movement of the camera between the car of the central characters and a following police car during conversation) suggest great potential.
But the film falls down quite horribly once Salva tries to explain the weird goings-on in his first act. The whole thing lacks any sense of internal logic for all the reasons stated in the other reviews on this site. You can wheel on a psychic to explain your back story as long as that back story makes sense & is leading somewhere. Blathering on a bit about every 23 Springs and foretelling the end of the film just so that you can end on a gag that justifies the title of the movie is not a good excuse. If only Salva had used a better writer to iron out these mistakes and put in a more satisfctory climax this could have approached classic status.
It's actually not difficult for Jeepers Creepers to be ""the best US horror movie for the last ten years"" because there hasn't been a lot for it to compete with. Go back 20 years and you'll find that ReAnimator, Evil Dead and the original Elm Street can still wipe the floor with this little horror pic. Nevertheless I'll be interested to see what Victor Salva comes up with next.",1005177600,,1911,4.574344023323615

Boared out of their lives, they play a game to spot out hidden messages in cars license plates and on one spooky vehicle, the license plate reads ''BEATINGU'' [get it?!?!]. After they are almost run off the road by this ''maniac'', they spot ''the creeper'' dumping what looks like a body down a a sewage pipe! And in time hounored fashion, they go back to the abonded church where the body was placed. After one head trip of a thrill in the titular church, they head back to town yet the creeper is hungry and is peckish for a certain ''snack'' from one of the clueless teens....
It is obvious that director VICTOR SALVA would like a JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 and so will the blood hungary teens who were taught the slasher survival skills from SCREAM 1,2 AND 3. There are understated performances from our Trish and Darry. There are cheap looking effects straight from B movie hell yet there is still fun to be had from this movie which is not your average SCREAM clone.

It started out calm and mellow then BAMM out of no where loud noisy car screchs, screams, and jumpable footage.  But after I learned that our main characted, WHO IS A GUY, has a Rose tatooed around his belly button, CAN WE GET ANY LAMMER!?, I began to loose faith.  The creature was rather cool in the begining.  We don't see it until the middle of the movie.  This is the Technique that was so perfectly used by Ridley Scott in Alien. THAT IS A TRUE MODERN HORROR FILM!  Then when we finaly see the monster we see a lot of familurarities of past horror creatures.  Classic Bat wings, a grey, leathery body.  Then it does something.  It what, Makes a really loud obnoctious noise and then these Spices pop off it's face and create this webbed hat thing that looks like and inverted Tricerotops's frill.  And in the end.  Our main Character so creativly named Jilly or something like that I FOUND THIS FITTIN BECAUSE HE HAS A GIRL'S NAME AND A ROSE TATOOED ON HIS STOMACH Get's offed and all we see is his face which still has perfect for except for the fact that his eyes are missing and our creature stands up behind him and it's eyes meet perfectly with Jilly's and we see his bright brand new eyes he just ate.  BTW.  He has to eat the body part in order for it to replace his.  Plot wasn't all to bad but this movie could have been so much better than what it was.

1656978,4,B00005RHGK,"This movie has to be the most infuriating films in existence. I went in not expecting much...just a boring but hopefully enjoyably bad horror flick. However, as the first half of the film unravels you realise two things....
1. this guys seen far too much texas chainsaw massacre and has decided to rip off huge chunks of it mood, story, and enviroment.
2. you have to forgive him cause he's somehow managing to do it all in an equally frightening and yet enjoyable way that doesn't seem to be able to do wrong. and is actually far scarier than texas chainsaw....
you see...in the first half of the movie we have a gradual build up of events...but no too gradual and not too slow. we have genuinely scary as hell moments that almost make you want to turn away from the screen in disgust/terror...but not over the top or overtly disgusting. we have two kids out in the middle of nowhere with a figure hunting them down. but it's all well handled and extremely effective as the writer/director manages to pile on suprise after suprise. the seen with the killer on the roof of the police car has to be seen to be believed!
however...then comes the second reel of the film, and without giving anything away (let's just say that if i explain what the killer is then the first half probably won't seem scary anymore) we end up with an increasingly cheesy movie that looks akin to a stephen king tv movie. yep..bits are that bad.
the ideas are still there and some of them are quite superb. even the final explanation of the killer and why everythings happenning manages to almost be a fairly haunting idea. but the fact is it show too much and with the modest budget it has-it just cant handle the second reel. hell, even with a larger budget they simply should of stayed with the way the story is originally going and built upon it.
i've tried not to sound too harsh here as this really is (in its greater moments) one of the finest horror movies i've seen in a long long long time. and if nothing else its a wonderfully refreshing change from the post-modern humour driven adventures of the scream type films. nothing against them or anyhting, but we need to get back to some of the roots of horror films, and remember that not all killers stalk babysitters in the suburbs.
if you like jeepers creepers then you must of course see the texas chainsaw massacre. and even duel. and just as i have an excuse to do it..go watch the original evil dead again...to remember how its all done right.",1005091200,,2484,4.485651214128035

The brother decides to investigate and climb down a dirty rat infested pipe--c'mon who would really do this?

1656998,3,B00005RHGK,"I suppose that a lot of people going to the movies today have grown up on such tripe as Scary Movie, the Friday the 13th series and other crappy horror films.  I suppose these same people expect that every little detail of a film must be explained on an adolescent's level, so as not to confuse them while they watch the films with their eyes as their mouths cannot keep from running while in the theatre.  It's a funny thing - sound when added to a film allowed for certain nuances of the theatre to be present, so that the visual didn't have to do all the work.  So to those who would call this film bad, I say:  turn off your cell phone, stop talking to your buddies, and pay attention to the movie.
Jeepers Creepers isn't the finest horror film ever made, but it certainly is one that can scare the bejesus out of you.  Certainly there are very standard plot devices in action here - but isn't that part of the formula for a horror film?  ...
Jeepers starts off using bits and pieces of known scare tactics and then milks them with a wink and a nudge.  Should the lead characters go back and see whats up at that creepy looking house where the even creepier looking guy was ....?  Of course not!  The characters even acknowledge this fact.  However, pulled by the same force that requires everyone passing an accident to rubberneck, they do.  (And let's face it - if they didn't - the movie wouldn't have been made).
At once scary, silly, laughable, and immensely frustrating, Jeepers Creepers shows us a new (albeit traditional and truly old hat) villain: a monster! .
Just what this monster wants is never fully explained as the film truly frustrates us by setting itself up for an obvious sequel (which I truly hope gets made).
The film features fine actors performing honestly and well.  Eileen Brennan appears in an extended cameo that is quite unforgettable.  The script is good, the cinematography is quite well done.
When you get up from a horror film, you are hopefully intelligent enough to know that the action on the screen is not possible in the real world.  You have just been treated to little fright akin to a ride on a good roller coaster.  If the movie made you jump, squirm, turn from the screen, or possibly yelp, then its done its job.
Jeepers Creepers does far more than that.  This is a good film that delivers on the scares and leaves you wanting more.

I'm not saying I'm not a fan of this sort of film, quite the opposite in fact, it's just that more often than not, after the hype and two or three 'talked about' scenes ( which are usually in the trailer ) they tend to fall back into cliched acting with thin pointless and obvious storylines. Jeepers Creepers however, lends itself in part to the more traditional horror picture with an eery feel from the off, first brought to us by films such as 'Ammytiville' and 'Texas chainsaw massacre'. It think it benifits hugely from the stars being unkown, they bring a fresh innocence to precedings and the fear throughout is very genuine and believable. Without giving too much away the plot is thus; brother and sister on there way home for the holidays and get mixed up with mysterious demon who terrorises them. There is a feel of 'Duel meets T.C.M' to the film but with a more spiritual sureal slant. I very much enjoyed the idea of the 'monster' being unreckonisable in the shadow's ( Halloween like ) and was a bit let down when you saw him up close - clearly a man in a suit, it took the edge off it slightly. Apart from that and a couple of 'I knew that was going to happen bits' not a bad film at all. Worth a look, and it may even make you jump!",1004400000,,1336,4.326693227091633

Other problems with this movie:
1. Our demonic creature, invincible--even invulnerable--and scary, can fly...yes, FLY...yet feels compelled to drive (yes, DRIVE) around incognito in a truck stolen from the DUEL (nod to a good film by Spielberg) studio lot in a disguise that would have made DARKMAN say, ""Oh, please.""
2. Is this creature scary?
*Yes!*
After you?
*Oh, yes, please someone stop it!*
Is it eating a victim?
*Why, yes it is...let's watch, sis, whaddya say?*
Most people run when they have a chance, but not our ""static"" duo...they're going to watch every gruesome moment as our hero...um...demon begins to eat someone's head.
3. The scarecrow scene. Was there a point? Did the demon really feel compelled to use a ruse that was devised more to scare the audience then to serve any meaningful purpose within the story's context? Also, what was up with the CATS???? The movie was creepy enough without some deranged woman who attempts to be creepy, but is just downright eccentric and in need of better lighting for her house. Advice: use Yellow Pages.
4. Victims. Victims galore. Over 500 and counting in a deserted area. Did anyone ever think of looking? Even if they were all travelers, you think that the dragnet of law enforcement would sit and ponder, ""You know, those darned kids took the same route as the other 498 other missing cases in this darned area. Maybe we should ask that weird fellow at the abandoned building over yonder...seems kinda strange that there is a truck parked in front of it. *spitting and bell sound*""
5. Jeepers Creepers...where did you get those eyes...was this really meant to shock us at the end? Oh, the demon took the little fellow's eyes...what a surprise.
6.  The CAR.  Oh, that hurt the most.  I could almost hear the director saying, ""Hey, Bob.  This scene needs some tension.  Whaddya think?""  Bob:  ""Oh, I've got it!!  How about making the car difficult to start?!?  We haven't done that before!!""  (repeat 6 times -- but when it's not necessary, make sure the car starts just fine like when they decide to run over the demon).  It was the first time that I can recall actually moaning out loud in a film every time I heard the engine grind.
With some rework and common sense, this story could have worked beautifully. It's also nice to see a horror story that serves to perpetuate itself by not making us wonder if the demon died, but to let the demon survive. But the arguing between the two main characters who somehow manage to develop an undying bond near the film's end, a pointless psychic, a creature that obviously has no need for disguise if it can survive being run over by a car several times, law enforcement that practices ""let's stay in a huddle so one grenade could take us out"" tactics, and so on, was enough to make me say, ""What was that?

So you've got a truly scary monster, very talented actors, and some great scenes. So why the two star rating? Plot. I found myself watching this movie, waiting to find out what this thing is, where it came from, and how it came to live in some hole in the ground in the middle of nowhere.

He uses old cliches but doesn't exploit them as much as the new teeny bopper horror films.  Furthermore, he uses an excellent amount of tragedy (not too much, not too little) by the end of the film, I really felt for these siblings.

1657007,5,B00005RHGK,"""Jeepers Creepers"" is an excellent, cleaver, and very scary film.
I've seen it 6 times and I loved it everytime. I really liked Justin Long and Gina Philips, they do a very ""believable"" job as bickering brother and sister. This is the first film by Victor Salva that I have seen and I think he did a very good job at directing ""Jeepers Creepers"", and the way he used ""Jeepers Creepers"" by Paul Whiteman and his Swing Wing is very creepy. ""Jeepers Creepers"" has all the ingredients of a horror film, it has a creepy score, people make life-threatening
mistakes, and most of all, it has good-old-fashioned scares. I don't get why people don't like this film, I mean people have that right, but I don't understand why they didn't like it. Like for example, the reviewer (I won't any names) who wanted to know what the point of the film was, films don't usually have a point, all they are are tools we use to escape from reality, to get away from all the troubles of the world and in the case of horror movies, it's so we can get a few scares and then go back to life. He also wanted to know why they showed the bodies sewn together? I think they did it to show what the creeper's hobies may have been, even if it was as sick as sewing dead bodies together.
""Jeepers Creepers"" is good for a few scares, and (in my opinion) the best film of the year so far. I jumped at about 4 different scenes, and you probably will too.

1657029,3,B00005RHGK,"The first 45 minutes of Jeepers Creepers where pretty good, when all of a sudden the imaginary floor beneath it fell through. One of the biggest problems was the monster, not necessarily it's appearance physically, but it's appearance at all. Movie maker's of films such as ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Relic"" did themselves and the audience a favor by not revealing the villain's appearance too early, that way the viewers imagination would be far worse than anything found in the creature shop. One of the coolest character's on screen comes to mind: Predator. The greatest extent of the case being ""Blair Witch Project"", in which the villain isn't seen at all! Only its effect's. I do like how the creature shows an even nastier side before going out the window. That was fairly creepy!
When it's in the shadow's and wearing the ""Raiden"" hat, it appears more hostile.

The story is fine. It start's out like Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"", as the kids are chased down an empty highway by a menacing, rusty, armored, souped-up, truck. Then quickly, after the most important discovery in the film, the rest of the plot flies around like an un-tied balloon. Another problem is there are many, many question's never answered. That's where the headache factor comes in. But, after watching it a second time, I did catch details I had first overlooked and it made more sense.
I liked how the ending doesn't completely rely on Hollywood's normal scheme. If you see it, try and tell me that the menacing truck isn't more effective than the monster (at times). Also, how did the monster get his personalized plate?

All the interest and scariness get destroyed by stupid, predictible plot twists. They have even thrown in the vaugue, overweight psychic for good measure. Why would the killer need an ax when he can obviously just tear victims to pieces? Why do they bother to show us bodies that have been sewn back togther. Why is the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" mentioned as an omen of approaching doom and then only used once?

1657036,5,B00005RHGK,"Ok, let's try again since AOL booted me when I had my review finished and I lost it...

I was pleasantly surprised that it was not the typical comedy/slasher movie of late, such as Scream (1,2,3), Last Summer, etc.  There was only one funny scene in Jeepers that I can recall and that was the name calling stint between the brother and sister.  I, and other movie goers, jumped out of my seat several times.  I had to move to the back of the theater with my back against the wall to avoid those irritating late attendees walking up behind me and startling me while watching the movie!  (And people, pleeeeease get a clue and leave your cell phones and crying babies at home!!!).  Even though there were scenes where you wanted to scream out ""get out of there dummies!"" to the brother and sister, there were still many scary scenes.  I agree with some reviewers that the psychic was just a waste of time, and would also like to know where the creeper came from, but it was a fun movie regardless; not in the true sense of the word ""fun,"" but fun as is getting to be scared.  I haven't been scared since the original Nightmare on Elm Street came out at theaters in 1984.  When I and other people came out of Jeepers (JC), several of us jumped when turning a corner in the theater hallway and there was a dark luminous shadow on the wall which happened to be just a shadow from the drinking fountain...

Immediately after Jeepers, I went over to see Rock Star thinking it would get JC off my mind; talk about scary...go see Rock Star.  Anyway, while leaving the theater, I kept thinking I heard footsteps behind me and with the creeper on my mind, I ran to my car.  I can't wait to see it again and buy it on DVD!  I'm going to drag my husband (he's scared silly of horror movies) and my teen son to see it too.  Some reviewers are giving it reviews as if it was supposed to be some Shakespearean play, gees, lighten up, it's exactly what it's supposed to be; a ""B"" horror flick, but much better than the silly teen horrors out.",1001808000,4,2025,4.294736842105263

1657057,2,B00005RHGK,"Based on Freytag's pyramid of Drama, the rising action of the film; the introduction of the creature, was incredibly intriguing. But when it came to the climax, falling action, and dnouement (ending), the movie completly failed. Just when one is thinking that this is an exception to the regular C horror movies, your trust is lost once again. I recall people booing at the end of the movie and not one positive opinion was said. The ultimate fuel of horror and horror movies is not knowing the physical looks of what is putting you in the state of horror, therefore more horror movies should follow this rule. In the scene where the villian creature is driving that old rusty truck (which reminds one of Sweet Tooth's icecream truck from the Twisted Metal games) and crashing it into the teenagers car is an example of not showing the physical looks of the host of terror. There is an exception to commonly broken rule: If one shows the physical lookes of the host of terror at the ending in an unforgetable scene then one has achieved the goal of a succesful horror movie. We can also derive this rule from the Scream triolgy movies, even though they are not depicted as classic acts of horror. What also disappoints critics is the three questions that remained unasnwered about the villian creature include:
1. What is this thing?
2. Why it is here?
3. How did it get here?
The only piece of information that we do know is that the so called physcic women believed it to be a demon or Satan. As I said one could have improved the climax, falling action, and dnouement (ending) much better than what the final product turned out to be.

1657058,3,B00005RHGK,"""Jeepers Creepers"" is one of those films that starts off promising the audience that what they are going to see is a terrifying film. Well,that would have worked if the identity of the killer was never shown in magazines before the film came out and if the film didn't end to suddenly. Nevertheless,I enjoyed this film because it reminded me of one of those silly late night horror films I used to watch on television on a midnight Saturday. The story is as follows. Two college students,both brother and sister witness a mysterious looking man dump what they both believe to be bodies down a drain pipe. Of course the brother has to make sure they are bodies and against the wishes of his sister,they go back to make sure and they are right. That was a mistake on their part because these two kids are now stalked by the psycho who is later revealed as some batlike human creature. The makeup on the actor playing the creature is good,but why show what the creature looked like in magazines before the film came out. That spoils the surprise. The way this review is going,you would think that I would give it a rating of 2 stars,but I am giving it 3. I like these kind of films because they don't take themselves seriously and they are plain fun to watch. It's no the kind of film I would recommend to everyone,but for my personal taste,I thought it was a fun film,although I wouldn't exactly call it one of the best or worst horror films ever made. Like I said,It's a good time at the movies.",1001376000,,1494,4.4363636363636365
1657059,3,B00005RHGK,"As a lover and connoisseur of horror movies, I had high hopes for this film (especially in light of the tremendously disappointing last few years we've seen in the genre). I was both impressed and disappointed. [VERY minor plot spoilers follow, so beware]
The acting is wonderful, particularly Gina Phillips in the role of Trish. The new faces are a welcome change. The scenes where Darry goes through the church, I think, were the freakiest and most gratifying of the whole movie. If you haven't seen it, you'll see what I mean. And I can say that I was genuinely apprehensive about that stupid beat-up truck--I kept watching for it to reappear on the road and jumped every time it did.
Now for the bad news...First of all, haven't we had enough of horror movies making references to horror movies? You know, the ones that say things like ""If we were in a horror movie, then you'd be dead right after we have sex"" (no, that particular one's not in this movie)? I think there were two lines in particular that made me groan. They offered nothing to the script except to rip me right out of the movie mindset, and should have been left on the cutting room floor.
Secondly, most good monster/demon/scary creature flicks either have a really, really, really scary monster (something original), or they just don't ever give you a good look at it. This one, unfortunately, doesn't do either. You see the thing, many times, and it's really not THAT freaky. It looks like something I would see getting it's butt kicked (very easily) by Buffy on Tuesday nights. I would have liked it better with a few glimpses and a whole lot of shadows and noises. But that's just me, the money-spending viewer.
The whole psychic-lady thing didn't work for me. I realize that there had to be somebody to reveal certain things about what the two main characters were up against, but it was all little too convenient and contrived for my taste.
Lastly, the ending--was that really necessary? I think they could have lopped off a big chunk of it and we all would have been happier. It all goes back to what I said before about the creature--sometimes the scariest things are the ones you DON'T see (I mean, come on! Why do you think the Blair Witch Project was so successful?).
Overall, I would recommend seeing this movie, but don't pay the full $8 or whatever. See the matinee or wait for video.",1001289600,3,2371,4.607565011820331

When the day finally came I was so excited, but had all my hopes built up impossible expectations? No. The first hour of the film is so perfectly crafted that the last thirty minutes have to be forgiven. The scares are plenty, the suspense is great, the score is creepy, the characters are funny, and the monster is mean. The final thirty minutes of the film are only a dissappointment because the rest of the film is so brilliant, it all winds down into a predictable finale, that comes way too soon, and isn't as creepy as the director must have invisioned it would be.

1657062,4,B00005RHGK,"It's been a long while since a horror movie has came anywhere close to those back in the eighties. While Jeepers Creepers doesn't exactly remind you of those campy horror films from over a decade ago, it's a breath of fresh air and different than the recent ""teen horror"" slasher films we've seen in the past few years. And I must say, it's about time.
While driving home for college break, a brother and sister are tailgated by a psycho in a huge green truck. Later on, they come across the same truck parked beside an old abandoned church. They both see a mysterious figure dumping what seems to be several body bags down an old sewer pipe. A few moments later, the brother wants to go back to investigate, but the hesitant sister thinks it would be absolutely absurd to go back. After talking it over, and realizing that they could possibly save someone's life if they happened to be still alive, they decide to go back.
What they then find is something horrendus. Soon they find out, that this madman knows that they've found his burial place. And it will stop at nothing to get what it wants. The thing itself, isn't even human. It's something far more evil and demonic. It's a monster. A monster that looks like a cross between Freddy Kreguer gone bad and the Lephrechaun.
While the movie does fit some stereotypical cliches, what horror film doesn't? At least it's not another masked human figure stalking a bunch of helpless teens with an absurd motive. While the motive for this creature in Jeepers Creepers is mentioned, far more of it is left to the mind and remains mysterious. The acting in the film is quite good. The film itself isn't really scary, but it is very creepy and there's plenty of gore for everyone. I think horror fans should give this a try.

However, the whole movie seem very ridiculous as how could a teenager so curious to check out something that already look so scared, maybe it is movie, it should just go to the police station and have them worked it out. No, but that's how the movie start. And it really took almost fifteen minutes I guess just listening to both the brother and sister talking. Would that too long just to get knowing the characters? After church event, it really start some good playing, kill the cops and the visit of the old woman house, really freak me out. At the end, it give me some connect I thought would that be end up like Resident evil game, the brother and sister find some super weapons and kill that thing at the police station.

1657075,3,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers was not the best or most innovative horror film I have ever seen, but it certainly was entertaining. The Beginning, I feel, is the best part of the movie. The Truck coming from behind the car with the horn blaring is simply bone chilling, just sounds completely scary, and is when you least expect it. Also the second best part of the movie is the ending. The ending is not your standard ending for a movie, but I feel that this is really a good ending for a horror movie especially. I think the acting in the movie is great too and it's definitely nice to see some new faces in movies. Also some of the tricks that the Creeper does to hide his evidence is clever too instead of the usual nobody sees anything and every thinks the main characters are crazy routine. The plot also keeps you guessing. Some people see this as a major downfall and the director's lack of explanation, but I think this is a great way to keep people interested and thinking. There are some parts in the movie that do have a point and people over look them such as all the crows. Maybe the crows are how the Creeper acquired his power of flight since everything he eats becomes him.
In addition to all of this though the movie does have its downfalls in my perspective. First off, I think it would have been more scary and interesting if instead of a demon the Creeper was human and there was a more complex idea behind eating people's select body parts. Like for instance if he was collecting them for an experiment to resurrect his dead lover or something like that and he only took the best of everything. Also even though the plot keeps you guessing it could be a tad bit more established in some parts. Like how the Creeper was created or why he was created and why the old woman sees only information about the Creeper and his victims and nothing else. Is she connected?
I think the movie relied a lot on science fiction when it could have easily been converted into a scarier non-fiction story. I think things are scarier when they seem more real and there are things left uncovered. So in the end I rated Jeepers Creepers a 3 out of five stars because of the sci-fi connecting, not that I do not like sci-fi, but I think this movie could have done better with less of it. And if I say nothing else about it the ending is great and horrific.",1000944000,,2342,4.337129840546697

It looked different from your typical slasher movie, which it is...I'll give it that much. It ended up to be a total bore. It really isn't all that scary and is actually pretty dumb. It even makes fun of itself when the girl says something like, ""You know in scary movies when people do really dumb things in a movie and everyone hates them for it. This is it."" I mean, the movie wouldn't even be a movie if the brother and sister had just kept driving towards home like they were supposed to. But no, they had to inspect a strange creature. Uh-oh!

1657079,1,B00005RHGK,"I was wandering around the mall a few days ago with nothing to do, so I figured I'd treat myself to a movie.  I was actually looking to see Final Fantasy, but it turns out it was no longer playing.  Simply on a whim, as a replacement, I decided to go see 'Jeepers Creepers.'  Man what a disappointment.
My first groan came when I learned it was a Victor Salva film.  Salva, you may remember, is the convicted child-molester who had made the movie 'Powder.' I swore I'd never pay to see one of his movies and I was kicking myself when I realized my mistake.
My second error came relative to the plot.  Granted this is my own fault, I was told by a friend, the plot of the movie was similar to the Shirley Jackson story of 'The Lottery' where a town is sacrificing people to this demon that lived in a hole under a church.
That half-heard assessment turned out to also only be about half-right.  I won't rehash the plot completely, but in this movie, the townspeople are unaware of the demon (in the beginning that is).
The plot, to me anyway, never really seemed to come together.  It seemed as if there were several points that it tried to make, and then just gave up on.  For example, why after the demon took whatever body part he needed, did he stitch all the corpses back up and together?  What was the idea behind making a point of the dead interracial couple? I thought it was going to be a murder mystery for a few moments after that.  Why did he even have a hole to the old church when he could have just walked down into the basement?  What the hell was with the woman with all the cats?  What was with all the crows everywhere?  Did they work for the Creeper or something?  Things like this just seemed to keep piling up to the point that I wasn't really enjoying the movie anymore.  It just seemed to be all over the place.
I don't know, I was admittedly really never into gore/horror movies very much.  This just didn't do anything to change my mind.",1000512000,3,1962,4.262162162162162

As a person who has enjoyed good horror and bad horror for almost 40 years, this one was a refreshing change from all the ubiquitous teenage angst movies that ran rampant from the 90's. But this movie broke two of the most important laws of good horror movie making.
1) do NOT, under any circumstances, show your monster too soon.
and 2) never, ever, go for the cheap and done before SFX.
In the first situation, they had a really good thing going up until the scene with the cat lady. The terror was truly frightening, and the wall of bodies far better than even Hellraiser. But they revealed his whole identity too soon. What made the classic and genre setting movie ""ALIEN"" great was the fact that you did not see the entire creature until the movie was just about over. The kept the terror going until to prevent coronaries, they finally let you have it.
Now the SFX (speciall effects). While the whole demon angle was a welcome change, and the wings a nice touch, they lost me totally with that same overused terribly boring and not at all scary ""ghoul face"". No matter what addons they used, this mold has been done to death from everything from Creepshow, Legend, Buffy, Lost Boys, oh the bloody list goes on. Important SFX tip:
Retire this mold. If they wanted to convey a demon. Pick up some medieval books. Do the homework. The face could have been more frightening, like the little known but equally scary movie ""The Incubus"" (no, not the Shatner one). They portrayed a very unique Incubus. Small head, simian probocsis and jaw, small yellow sharp teeth, small pointed ears, and ghoulish green/grey skin. It was very new, never done before, and for a sexual demon, on the money. Another was the good makeup for the toungue in cheek movie ""The Unnameable"". There are thousands of amateur SFX people all over America who make extremely frightning faces just for their local ""Fright Fest"".

I was expecting a really scary thriller that would make me jump out of my seat every five minutes, but sadly that didn't happen. ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a story about two kids going home from college who notice a mysterious person dumping some things down a hole in the ground and so they decide to check it out. What they stumble upon is a creature who lives in an abandoned church and who likes to feast on people. Now he is after them for about 90 minutes. That is a very brief summary of the really dumb plot of this film.
I really was disappointed with this movie for a number of reasons. First, I really wasn't scared much in this film. Sure there were one or two parts that may have been a bit startling, but nothing really terrifying. Also, I was really bothered by how formulaic the film was. There were no real suprises in the story, except one at the end, but I won't ruin it for those of you who might still see this film after reading this. Anyone with half of a brain could figure out what is going to happen in every scene of this film. Finally, I did not think there was a real pay off to the film.",999907200,,1190,4.223684210526316

1657100,5,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers is a very good horror movie.
Actually it is a good movie period.
It's the first horror movie in a long time that was actually scary.
In the trailers for the film, you do not get too much information.
This was the best thing the producers could ever do for the film.
The fact that you don't know fully, where the film is going before you see it, helps to keep it fresh.
This movie has some very scary scenes in it ,but also has moments where you scream at the actors for not running sooner.
But, if they do run then the movie just would not be as good now, would it.
I guess in a way, in reality if someone was exsposed to the situation in the film, you might not run right away because of curiousity.
Not everyone thinks that way, but the characters in this movie happens to.
If you were in that situation you never really know what your reaction would be.
Any way, I really like the film, there isn't any dry or boring moments and its real entertaining and fun.
I won't give away the ending but it is not your typical movie ending.
Watch the movie and have fun with it.
I highly recommend this film for all horror fans and people who just want to have fun watching a movie.",999820800,,1191,4.16017316017316

It got straight to the thrills and chills with enough gore and surprises for all horror movie lovers. The plot is simple enough, a brother and sister are coming home from college (a realistic scenario for those of us in the younger generation) when they see a suspicious individual disposing of what looks like dead bodies. Natural curiosity ensues and the two are violently tossed into the mits of this killer. The relatively unknown actors add to the realism of the movie (no teen-idols added for the TRL fans). The fact that we we're seeing siblings removed all romatic elements that too often ham up newer ""horror"" movies. We are just given a straight ""monster"" movie. Is this movie an indication of the revival of the horror genre? Only time will tell. But ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a good start and a must-see for horror fans.",999820800,,959,4.783132530120482
1657103,5,B00005RHGK,"It was opening night, and I sat in the packed theatre, deliciously anticipating the movie that I had been waiting to see for so long. The trailers came to an end, and the darkened theatre got quiet. For the next hour-and-a-half I experienced the terror of the anxiously-awaited, buzz-building monster flick, ""Jeepers Creepers"".
It begins quietly, as brother and sister, Darry and Trish Jenner, are driving home from college--taking a deserted back road, where--as legend has it--a college couple was killed 23 years earlier. Soon the bickering brother and sister are overtaken by an ancient truck with blacked-out windows, and a sinister licence plate (B-EATNG-U). After their horrifying encounter with the truck, they continue onward towards home. But soon they pass by an abandoned church, and spot the dark-cloaked driver of the truck dumping bodies down a pipe. The mysterious figure comes after them again, and they barely escape. Darry decides to go back and see if anyone needs help. But he falls into the pipe and discovers a room with hundreds and hundreds of bodies. Soon after, Trish and Darry head off to the nearest town and tell their story to the police. But, they discover too late that they are being pursued by the dark figure in the truck--who relentlessly pursues them, and is revealed to be a terrifying demonic figure that is decidedly less-than-human--and it wants something from one of them. But what? And from whom?
The movie starts off with eerie stillness, and its funny, deceptive title masks what lies within. The film slowly building up until finally erupting into pure terror. The suspenseful, creepy opening; the truck's horrifying assault; the discovery of the pipe's contents; and the relentless pursuit of the two teens by the monstrous presence together makes for one of the scariest thrill rides in years, surpassing ""Blair Witch"", ""Sixth Sense"", and the ""Scream"" movies (and their countless rip-offs). Not since ""Halloween"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""The Exorcist"", and ""The Fog"" has a horror film been this gutsy and terrifying.
Writer/director Victor Salva's brilliant new film discards the stupid self-mockery of the modern ""Scream"" fare, and goes for a tight, serious, no-holes-barred story that is accompanied by some well-placed black humor, and very real suspense and shocks.
The story is deceptively simple, and as the story goes on, we are pulled into the reality of the movie, as Trish and Darry try to outrun the mysterious Creeper. Justin Long and Gina Phillips are extremely personable in the leads, and you come to care about them and their fate. Eileen Brennen as the old Cat Lady is a welcome, humorous relief during the scary goings-on--but she is seen too little. Patricia Belcher as the psychic woman Jezzelle is a part that should have been either cut down slightly or expanded, as she seems to have some past history with the Creeper that it not fully explained. But these are minor things. And Jonathan Breck as the horrifying Creeper is excellent at conveying a sense of true menace and evil. A new horror film monster that will probably join the ranks of Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees, Freddy Krueger, and all the other modern movie monsters. The creature, which begins as the unseen truck driver, to the dark scarecrow-like figure, and finally evolving into the hideous monster is truly an excellent effect. Kudos to all the people involved with making this monster--and this movie.
The film doesn't bother too much with explanations on the creature's origins(only saying that it comes back ""every 23rd spring for 23 days and that it eats to evolve its hideous shape even further. This also ties into the old song of the title, but you won't fully understand until the very end). The film's first half is built upon the mystery and terror of the unknown. The second half becomes the grueling chase as the unstoppable Creeper murderously pursues them--gradually revealed to be an inhuman monster. The final confrontation in the police station is suspenseful and exciting, and doesn't play to the cliches of most modern horror movies. And even better, it doesn't stoop to provide a sugar-coated, happy ending. This is one of the most recent films to have the courage to end on a wonderfully scary, and downbeat note.
All in all, this is one of the scariest film in a long time. It is tightly scripted, aggressively scored, marvellously acted, incredibly suspenseful, and intensely frightening. From the creepily quiet opening to the shocking, unforgettable final shot, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a modern masterpiece of horror that harkens back to the old days of horror, when movies were built not on self-referential humor and gore, but on scares. Never before have I heard a theatre full of people scream so loud. Definitely see it--if you dare!!",999734400,16,4807,5.0326223337515685
1657114,1,B00005RHGK,"Teenage road trip encounters monster and seeks help in Hicksville.  Incredulous, slack jawed townies (apparently what Hollywood thinks inhabits every `burg that isn't LA or NYC) in local diner gawp at our young protagonists.  Unsympathetic local police are quickly dispatched by monster.  If any of this sounds familiar, just wait until you see the showdown at the local constabulary.
Jeepers Creepers wastes most of its opening sequence trying to establish what a close relationship our young brother-and-sister victims share, and it's only downhill from there.  The monster, a demonic creature who unfortunately for us appears to be just a guy in rubbery-looking suit, is a MAJOR disappointment.  Locust-like, it emerges from its lair for 23 days every 23 years to replace its body parts by feasting on the flesh and viscera of its specially selected victims.  We are offered no explanation as to the significance of the number 23.  It lives in the basement of an abandoned church (where the victims are turned into a cool but fake looking 3-D wall treatment a la Aliens), and sports about town in an outlandish looking vehicle that has a really cool horn and vanity plates that roughly translate into `be eating you'.  I'm not really sure how it renews them since it only appears every 23 years.  An even bigger mystery is why an abandoned church, has a three-foot wide culvert pipe protruding from the ground at a 45 degree angle that leads to its basement.  Besides being convenient for a poorly imagined script, that is.
Basically the redeeming qualities of this film are the villain's car horn, a relatively inoffensive performance from Galaxy Quest's Brandon and a very amusing underpants joke.  I don't recommend it as anything higher than a third string backup.",999734400,,1771,5.030821917808219

But the reviews on this looked good, so, since my other half was out of town (she won't go to these) I thought I'd break my rules (don't spend money on horror flicks) and check it out. I should have followed the rules. This seemed very VERY formulaic to me. The beginning was cast from a worn out mold. The monster was low budget, the scary scenes didn't rev my motor and I kept waiting for some good sounds to bring the scary parts to life. On the other hand, I have a feeling that my 17 year old son, who loves this kind of flick would enjoy it, perhaps precisely for the same reasons I found it disappointing. I do like good fantasy and science fiction stories, creatively done. But I just didn't see much creativity in this one. But it does follow the pattern for horror flicks, so if you've watched every release of Halloween and the other series of horror stories, this might be the first in a chain of movies named after old songs.

Search as hard as you might, I doubt you will find a plot....anywhere!
The main characters have the survival instincts of a doorknob (Rose on ""The Golden Girls"" has more common sense), and prefer to wait for the ""creature"" to finish killing/eating its victim before trying to escape or kill it. The ""creature"" is NEVER explained. All you get is a ""psychic"" saying it feeds for 23 days every 23 years, basically for spare body parts. That's IT! No other background, and apparently SHE is the only living soul to know it exists. Visually, you would expect it to be a villain from Scooby Do, since the costume and make up effects are so sub-par that it looks like they utilised a Halloween shop, and a cheap one at that.
Even after the dramatic police station scene, there is a cut to the next morning, and everyone seems to have experienced nothing more traumatic than a paper cut!
It's small wonder that it has a virtually unknown cast (though Eileen Brennan's cameo was it's one bright spot), no respectable actor, after reading the script, would have lent their name to it.
Jeepers Creepers should have been direct-to-video, if that. Imagine the worst elements of the worst films you've seen in the horror genre, rolled into one production, and you have this film!",999561600,5,1386,4.684426229508197

The directors attempted to make one of the main characters a hero (by wanting to go back to the pipe...) Yeah write, he was a WUS.  I completely missed the weak attempts of horror satire in this movie b/c well, for lack of better words it was just plain stupid.  (However, there was one and only one attempt that was funny... the part before the leading actress drops her brother down the pipe... go sis!)

1657118,4,B00005RHGK,"It's been a long time since we've seen a movie that can shock us with a dark and suspenseful atmosphere. I like movies that can take me for a ride but I also like movies that can take me for ride not knowing where the movie is taking me and leaving me in the suspense and the anticipation of surprise. ""Jeepers Creepers,"" succeeds quite effectively where other horror movies fail miserably. First thing; we have two unknown actors who play brother and sister, you're given a little bit of back-story, you start the movie with some character development and it's kinda slow. This is the first rule in making a great movie! Not just horror movies but all movies! IMPLEMENT SOME CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! Make us care about the experience these characters are going through. Victor Salva does a great job making these points clear in the film and to the audience. Second thing; the audience must have moments where they need to squint their eyes when being drawn into a scene that doesn't give everything away immediately. Great examples of this can be found in classic horror films like John Carpenters, ""The Thing,"" and of course ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" Part of the successful fear factor those movies presented were the outstanding way the director presented things, ""darkly."" Third thing; give us an ending that isn't Hollywood fluff, where the heroes triumph and the villain is cast away failing his/her mission! This is one of the biggest mistakes in horror movies because it dilutes everything the story was made from, ""sheer terror!"" The terror must keep going even as the credits are rolling and the people are leaving the theatre. I think the ""The Blair Witch Project,"" was successful because you knew before even starting the movie the three filmmakers were reported missing. In John Carpenters ""The Thing,"" you have an ending that is quite simply the creepiest ending I've ever seen. Aside from horror, ""Titanic,"" called to the masses because everyone knew it was a doomed voyage, even though, ""Titanic,"" isn't a horror movie, people are magnetically drawn to doom-possibly because everyone one of us knows our days are numbered:(  The similarity from those movies and, ""Jeepers Creepers,"" is that in all of this, you're seeing a story of doom on the horizon and it's inevitable. That's what makes a great horror movie! It must have doom and the doom must be inevitable from the get-go. So there you have it! ""Jeepers Creepers,"" is most certainly not the greatest horror movie of it's genre but it definitely reinvigorates conventional Hollywood horror flicks by following the essential rules above.

1657120,3,B00005RHGK,"Jeepers Creepers is one of the scarier movies to come out in the past few years. It may not have had the best storyline, but it was very suspenseful. The plot: Brother and sister (Trish and Darry) are travelling home from college taking the backroads and constantly bickering when they almost get run off the road by a strange truck. Later on they pass this truck parked at an old run down church and see a large person throwing what appears to be wrapped up bodies down a pipe. Soon after passing, the truck takes off after Darry and Trish again, this time running them off the road. At this point, the characters become almost typical naive horror cliches and decide to go back and see what he through down the pipe instead of just getting the heck out of there. The suspense really builds when he enters the pipe and what he finds is very freaky. The film builds a lot of suspense from this point on and doesn't have any real boring parts all the way through and the door is left wide open for the Creeper to become the next horror franchise. Overall I found the story to be ok, but the films ability to horrify is definately strong. 'Jeepers Creepers,' especially the last scene, freaked me out.",999475200,,1199,4.429864253393665

However, if you like horror movies that are actually SCARY, then get out and see this movie. NOW!! This is ""old school"" style horror. It's a throwback to the great horror flicks of the '70's and '80's. There are no ironic asides to the audiences. No clever dialog that sounds nothing like what people say in the real world. Scream and its' clones rely on characters that seem to know everything and have something ""witty"" to say about it. Not here. The two kids are just normal people that get caught in an unbelievable situation. The movie is very atmospheric and world class creepy. The Creeper is slowly revealed to us throughout the movie, and he just gets scarier every time we see him. The movie plays on fear of the unknown. Every horror has the ""what was that"" moments. Mostly its just a setup for a masked killer to jump out of a closet to slice up some co-ed. But since we don't know what the Creeper is, or what he's doing, you never know what to expect during the ""what was that"" moments.... My favorite part? All I will say is...watch the police car. You'll see what I mean. Oh by the way... the girls will probably enjoy the lead actors' Keanu Reeves ""duh"" quality.",999388800,,1314,4.433884297520661
1657123,4,B00005RHGK,"Unintentional laughter and horror cliches abound in ""Jeepers Creepers,"" a film that adds yet another creature to the hall of horror monsters. Director Victor Salva, of ""Powder"" and ""Rites of Passage,"" brings with his latest venture an abundance of familiar scenarios and tactics, complete with teenagers whose morbid curiousity outweighs their fear. The plot origins may be new, but the execution remains as stagnant as the stench of a corpse (no pun intended).
And yet, I find myself satisfied with the film. This is one of the most brainless teenage horror movies I've ever had the pleasure of watching, falling into the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category of movies. Salva may fill his scenes with witless dialogue that provokes a gaffaw from audiences, but alongside those hearty laughs is a tight chord of suspense that may not last, but is nonetheless effective.
The film places us in the middle of nowhere, as teenagers Trish and Darryl (Gina Philips and Justin Long), are taking ""the scenic route"" home along country roads. Like many brothers and sisters, they constantly bicker, even as their lives are endangered when a decrepit truck follows them and makes dangerous attempts to pass their vehicle. This leads to the standard conversation of foreboding things to come, as Trish is reminded of an accident 20 years earlier that occurred on that same road, in which both bodies were never recovered.
No sooner has she said this than they drive by a run-down church, where that same vehicle is parked, the driver tossing large objects into a large pipe beside the building. But these are no ordinary objects, as the characters will tell you; ""It was something wrapped in a white sheet."" ""Something wrapped in a white sheet with rope."" ""Something wrapped in a white sheet and rope with red stains."" How observant of them.
After another on-road encounter with the strange vehicle, they make their way back to the church, where Darryl slides down the pipe and discovers a deluge of corpses that line the walls of the church basement (""a twisted Sistine Chapel,"" he later calls it). They make their way to a small diner/gas station, complete with the disbelieving locals, and cops who find their story mere childsplay until they lose their heads to the strange man who wears a hat that would look more becoming on Zorro.
The film may very well be an unintentional satire on the ills of teenage horror, resting mostly with the actions of the two mindless teenagers, who find it more important to stand around in disbelief than tuck tail and run. When put face-to-face with the creature, Trish decides it is more important to run it down with her car, a scene that carries a fitting exchange of dialogue as they observe the ""dead"" creature (Darryl: ""I think it's dead."" Trish: ""They never are.""). The final showdown places them in the Poho County police station, where, as they are pursued by the creature, they run to the highest possible room instead of out the front door.
The creature is the icing atop this ham-fest, something otherworldy and supposedly frightening. A psychic (go figure) who makes contact with Darryl warns him that the creature instills fear in people to decipher whether or not they have the right parts that he needs. His ability to go from one place to another in less than half the time it would take a normal person suggests to the characters that he may not be human long after we've already guessed. His strange hobble after he loses his foot to Trish's car is more laughable than scary, and his consumption of a police officer's tongue in front of a billboard that boasts the slogan ""Tastes So Darn Good!"" is a priceless comical irony.
The beginning of the film also contains some sharp shocks that had me jumping. The old tactics of hands reaching from out of nowhere, and people suddenly running into frame, all to the sudden pulse of the music, may not be fresh, but still have a great deal of kick left in them. And even though nothing important came of it, the underlying suspense is ever-present, and, at times, very intense.
I don't generally warm to films of this sort, but ""Jeepers Creepers"" combines suspense and unconventional comedy in such a way that it remains a cut above other films like ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Valentine."" Whether or not Salva meant for this to be a satire, we may never know, but it might be interesting to see it marketed as such upon a video release. The film attempts to be nothing more than mindless teenage horror, and on that it gets a passing grade.",999388800,,4538,4.7748091603053435

They do not go indepth into explaining the origin of the creature (which some have all Creeper,although I found no reference to a name in the movie).  It treats people as if they have an attention span. Jeepers Creepers has a very deliberately paced setup which serves to build the tension which serves the payoff.  The ending is very unconventional for films of this genre.  I enjoyed the film immensely and found myself thinking that this movie will serve as a milestone for all other horror films to come along, much as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, and Blair Witch Project did.  It stands apart from its peers when the market is so oversaturated and full of cookie-cutter copy cats from studios just wanting to jump on the bandwagon.

We don't need big name actors, a hit soundtrack, over the top special effects or involved story lines to make a good horror movie.  Im not going to go into the plot as Im sure you can read other reviews to get an idea, but the plot isn't what this movie is about...its an all out scare-fest with no-holds bar emotion and feelings as the creepy scenery and visions suck you in.  Its great to see a horror movie that once again incorporates the good ol' fashion ""scary part"" build up music instead of some hot band sing a top 40 song.  The special effects were outstanding, included with the ocassional CGI.  But after watching the movie there really wasn't alot of gore in the movie, most if not all the gore was shrowded in shadows or lighting.  I found this great because instead of in your face blood and guts we see a shadow of the monster eating...and what he is eating, how he is eating is left to our imagination which is absolutely great.  This movie's beginning reminds me alot of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre with its slow easy going beginning.  It lets you get to know the characters a bit and almost makes you feel like your in the back seat watching them bicker and as soon as the action starts the feeling you have is fabulous.  Over all, Jeepers Creepers was well worth my money...I wish I could of said the same for all the horrendous TEEN SLASHER movies that have been coming out (got kicked out of all 3 scream movies for busting up laughing because they were so horrible)  But its fabulous to finally see a movie that can be classified as a great HORROR movie instead of those ""suspense-thrillers""",999388800,3,1818,4.4818181818181815

In an age of digital effects, where any work of magic can be executed on camera, director Vic Salvo still understands that what is most effective is what you cannot see. Some of the scariest scenes take place in shadows and corners where our view is obstructed and the terror is based on sound. Even the highly distinctive Creeper is hardly ever seen in full light.
The film relies on what is called ""idiot plot"" in order to get things going.

The idiot plot goes over the edge when he decides to crawl down a dark chute leading into total darkness, with his sister holding his ankles. No way. I don't believe it.
What little we need to know about the creature we learn from a psychic, but her character is not developed beyond this function and she sticks out like a sore thumb - the character only exists for the sake of exposition.
Otherwise, the cast of mostly unknowns are wonderful, especially Justin Long as brother Darius. Eileen Brennan has a terrific cameo as a woman living alone with her many cats.
And notwithstanding the above, this remains a good, scary movie. It's been a while.",999388800,,1341,4.662447257383966

WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???? And they didn't even say what he was! Oh well, I give it some credit I guess. Any way the plot is about two siblings headed home from colledge. As they drive home there almost crushed by a speeding old rusty truck. They regain there contiousness and they keep driving. They pass a house with that same car in the driveway. The ""Man"" is out of his truck and is putting some kind of wrapped up something in white sheets with red stains into a tunnel in the ground. The two of them get scared and drive off but then they see him leave and diside to go investigate. The guy goes down in the tunnel and see corpes hanging all over the walls with things like heads sewn back on. They decide to tell the police at a coffee shop, when they get a strange telephone call back. The ""Thing"" chases them in there car, and leaves mysterious ""Clues"" along the way. Will the two be eaten alive? And what  does this all have to do with JEEPERS CREEPERS find out when you watch the movie!",999388800,,1154,4.269406392694064
1657131,4,B00005RHGK,"I saw this movie today and I thought it was very very good. It was very disturbing and scary and it was the kind of film that would give you nightmares. The movie had a great look (the ""middle of nowhere in heartland America look"" that was made popular in great horror classics like Night of the living dead,) that made it very creepy. The movie also had believable characters and intelligent dialogue and good acting. The monster is not very scary looking but he is terrifying because he does horrible unspeakably gruesome things to his victims. (The things he does to his victims would freak Hannibal Lecter out.) I think he is the scariest horror villain that I have seen in years and he reminds me of the old classic american Urban legend boogeyman stories. I also enjoyed how some things were left unexplained and I enjoyed the unhappy ending that didn't follow the popular monster movie genre. (I won't give anything away but I will say that things don't end well for one of the heroes and the monster doesn't even come close to being destroyed.) I also enjoyed the old creepy 1940's (or 1950's, I'm not sure,) music that was used. (Jeepers Creepers and another old song about the boogeyman.) This film will disturb and horrify you if you see it. You will LOVE this movie if you watch horror movies to be disturbed and frightened.",999302400,,1336,4.594142259414226

1657143,5,B00005RHGK,"Creators of lame horror films beware!! I have just heard your death knell sound. This movie is an all-out terrifying ride that pulls no punches whatsoever. Director Silva deserves kudos for creating a movie that will definitely scare you and get under your skin. No goofy one-liners. No celebrity guest stars who couldn't act if they had an instruction manual. No soundtrack full of hip songs by bands du jour. No, none of that...just a solid tale of terror and the unknown skillfully put together and performed. Fans of the current teen horror films beware! With movies like this being released, they are starting to look more and more like what they really are; crass marketing ploys aimed at sucking all of the cash from your pockets and killing your brain cells.

It had a good storyline, most horror movies has a boyfriend and a girlfriend and they make out or have sex and then something bad happens, well in this movie it has a brother and sister.  Its really good because its not a cliche and it proves that a movie can be good without sex!  I really recommend this movie, its really good, just don't go by yourself! =)",999302400,,419,4.265822784810126
1657145,4,B00005RHGK,"If you want to get just plain scared, go see ""Jeepers Creepers"".  However, take someone with you to hold on to.  It has the ingredients of classic horror flicks of the past and the sounds, scenes and expressions are a script for terror.  I felt my skin crawl for the first hour and jumped out of it (my skin, that is) five times.  It's been a long time since a film has had that effect on me...and I'm an avid horror flick fan.  It has bits and pieces of ""Cujo"", ""Pet Sematary"", ""Poltergeist"" and a little-known low-budget classic ""The Funhouse"".  I give the first hour FIVE stars.  It drops to an overall rating of 4 as the horror dwindles and dwindles and dwindles.  But you are so frightened from the outset, it keeps you on your seat till the end.  Only two nagging points --- the sound of the failing transmission in Trish's Chevy...and Darryl's overused facial expressions of terror.  Other than that...GO SEE IT!  It'll give you the creeps...jeepers creepers, that is.",999302400,,975,4.578034682080925
1657146,3,B00005RHGK,"This film is fun but unfortunately, not quite as terrifying as many of the reviewers may lead you to believe. It starts off in the same manner as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Night of the Living Dead: on a lonely stretch of road in the middle of nowhere. Being alone and vulnerable, the characters' (one significantlly better to look at than the other) first run-in with the Creeper is extremely creepy. This opening scene gives a whole new meaning to road rage. It is very realistic and draws you into the plight of the characters. However, after 30 or 40 minutes, the realism gives way to an all-out, corny monster movie. The Creeper is no longer scary at all. He resembles a foe Godzilla may have faced back in the '70s. If you sit through this unfortunate second half, you will be handsomely rewarded by the final scene. I'm not going to tell. You just have to see it. I'm a sucker for horror films and did enjoy this one, I just wish they kept the monster in the dark a bit more. When the realism wanes, the scares do too. A creep that looks like a man but kills like a monster is much scarier that a creep that looks like a dinosaur from Jurassic Park - The Ride.",999302400,2,1172,4.3076923076923075

1657148,1,B00005RHGK,"If your looking for a scare, take your ten bucks to the video store and pick up any axe-wielding-mask-wearing-psychotic-teen-terrorizing horror flick and some jiffy pop. I have seen Jeepers Creepers and it's not creepy. It's not scary, gory or suspenseful as promised either. The plot centers around two college students who witness a man disposing of two bodies, discover his underground ""house of pain"" and subsequently become wrapped up in his rampant little feeding frenzy. I have to hand it to the actors in this film (although I do question their judgment). They have done well with a poorly-written script and a shallow, unoriginal storyline. The majority of the film is slow. There are no clinchers, few plot twists and thanks to the brick-to-the-head subtlety of the foreshadowing, you know how it's going to end long before it actually does. Definitely not the edge-of-your-seat, you'll-have-nightmares quality film. In short: don't waste your money. Or your time.",999302400,,974,5.25
