1413396,4,B00005ABVH,"This is an absolutely fantastic spooky film which draws you in.  The DVD presentation is very good, with an excellent print and excellent picture quality.  The only drawback is that this is a French film and some stupid guy guy has to read all the titles and lines, and you can barely understand what he's saying through his strong French accent.  The other thing about the soundtrack is the music.  It's a cross between Irish folk music and church music.  When I started this DVD I tried to turn off the sound, but then realized that there were no subtitles, so I was forced to listen to the bad music and that old French wretch throughout the film, but it's not TOO distracting.  The audio is the only reason I didn't give this DVD 5 stars, and though I do prefer the 1949 version of this title this one has mesmerising cinematography and is really good for a silent film.",1009670400,7,874,4.43125
1413397,4,B00005ABVH,"This silent film by French avant-guarde film director Jean Epstein is a unique, and dark take on the classic Poe tale of premature burial and internal decay of the soul.  Combining the story ""The Oval Portrait"" with the Usher story, Epstein and his actors create a solid narrative.  The camera work is very powerful, helping to convey the nightmare within the story.  If you enjoy silent films and Poe's work, I would highly recommend this one.",994118400,14,444,4.815789473684211
1413398,4,B00005ABVH,"With Luis Bunuel as assistant director, Jean Epstein directed THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER in 1928. It's one of these movies always quoted in encyclopaedia or dictionaries but almost impossible to see if you don't live in Paris, London or Los Angeles. At last, THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER makes a discreet appearance in the DVD market. Except for a scene access, you won't find here any bonus features and the 66 minutes copy has obviously known better times. Don't expect a Criterion treatment and appreciate a portion of Movie History lost between black and white spots.
Edgar Allan Poe's novelette gives its name to the movie but Jean Epstein has freely adapted it by borrowing several themes from other works of the great american writer. One can also say that the arrival of Roderick Usher's friend is an homage to Friedrich Wilhelm's Murnau's NOSFERATU. But THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER has a poetic appeal of its own created by innovative camera movements, hypnotical actors and a labyrinthic castle. If you have the inner courage to rent or buy a silent movie, you too will be hypnotized by this forgotten masterpiece.
A DVD zone reference.",993859200,6,1155,4.751243781094527
1413399,5,B00005ABVH,"This silent film has retained it's French title cards and has the interpetation spoken by a narrative voice. At first I was slightly distracted by the voice, but after a couple title card readings, I felt it complimented this unusual and vivid presentation nicely. Although the description of this film as ""Gothic eye-candy"" is accurate because of the classic sets and shadowy lighting, it is the intense characterizations by the actors that make the viewer feel he's watching the story unfold through Poe's eyes.  Impressionist influence is noticable, but the avant-garde aspect is equally prevalant with clever and innovative camera movement and effects. The malody of Roderick Usher is chilling here and its hard to imagine a better telling of The Fall of the House of Usher.",991872000,4,778,5.125984251968504
1413400,4,B00005ABVH,"I knew very little about this story when I saw the movie, but it turned out to be an excellent horror movie.  Not a modern slasher film, but something slow and creepy that gets under your skin.  It's frightening, but for no apparent reason.  Unfortunately not a movie that would get made today.",982368000,16,294,4.509433962264151
7935236,3,B00005ABVH,"An 1929th year story of a wife visiting her husband after her death and his friend involved is performed brilliantly.

Eventually, a silent cinematograph demanded even more artistic skills than recent produces animated.

Also staged brilliantly, it is simply boring to watch this stuff today.",1320019200,,292,5.466666666666667
7935237,5,B00005ABVH,"Poe's world is unique, and therefore extremely difficult to adapt to the screen.  So far this is the only film I've seen which succeeds in truly evoking the atmosphere of his work.  Phantasmagoric, hauntingly romantic (in the true sense), a masterpiece.  This is 7th art poetry.  I'm sure Edgar Allan Poe would have been delighted with this.  If you like his oeuvre, this is definitely the one to see.",1298678400,,401,4.753623188405797
7935238,2,B00005ABVH,This one was a gift I'm hoping that the recipient enjoyed it. I didn't think much of it when I saw it.,1292371200,,102,3.6818181818181817
7935239,5,B00005ABVH,"I'm a big silent horror film buff, and I cannot praise this seemingly lesser known masterpiece high enough.

The camera work is magnificently eerie and ethereal. Epstein places great emphasis on the House having a life of its own as well as on the feeling of some phantasmagoric presence within it, and he is a master at developing the type of nervous, ominous premonition that is Poe's forte. There is much very effective use of camera movement and slow motion, especially. I've never seen anything quite like it. Epstein has his own style.

I found the acting of Mr. Usher to be remarkably moving and modern. You feel his grief.

Special kudos goes out to the composer, music historian Rolande de Cande, for his/her outstanding creativity! The main love theme is a strange medieval tune, played on dulcimer, which I found extremely effective. In the more horrific moments, distant modal melodies mix with a chaos of screeching strings and eerie noises. Possibly the coolest and most fitting film score ever added to a silent film.

The DVD unfortunately has no extras.",1268438400,2,1070,4.895027624309392
7935240,4,B00005ABVH,"This film should be watched like a painting, as the visual effects are its most beautiful feature and strongest actor. Jean Debucourt plays Sir Roderick Usher in a very convincing, obsessive way. As a matter of fact, his obsession for painting his wife is at the center of the action, it creates a beautiful work of art as it simultaneously destroys the sitter, and is beautifully rendered as we understand it from Marguerite Gance, who plays the beautiful, helpless, wilting Madeleine Usher, always weaker every time we see her. Abel Gance, the great director of 'Napoleon"" and her real life husband, has an uncredited part in this film, I supposse one of the people in the inn or maybe the coachman.
Charles Lamy  plays the friend, or Allan, The Guest, that comes to visit the Ushers and through him and his visit we get to see the final days of this doomed couple. He was very courageous as it is hard to understand how he could stay more than a day in that hellish environment.
The setting of the house in the middle of a horrid, putrefied landscape is sublime. The film occurs almost entirely in the salon, which is a magnificent ruin, but there are also great shots of the entrance hall, the stairs, the wind coming through the windows, books falling, and many other eerie details. The portrait of Lady Usher is surrounded by an extravagant baroque frame that resembles a cage for her soul, a perfect detail. The burial and crypt scenes were not as interesting, but it was a very moving, expressive movie, definitely related to the aesthetics of German Expressionism. The participation of Buuel I am sure added certain Surrealistic effects such as the owl and the frogs.
Seeing the film was interesting, but remembering the images has proved to be even more of a pleasure than I would have thought.  Like ""The Golem"" and ""Nosferatu"" the images stay in your mind forever.",1249257600,4,1876,4.716463414634147
7935241,5,B00005ABVH,"Epstein's sterling adaptation of the well-known Poe story today remains one of the most haunting and visually adventurous horror movies of the silent era. Certainly, the film's expressionistic use of slow-motion techniques and eerie settings owes a lot to the presence of surrealist Luis Buuel, who served as assistant director. Gance (wife of French director Abel) is radiant, too, even as a shrouded specter. With its lurid, foggy air of mystery and demented otherworldliness, ""Usher"" is a triumph of the gothic sensibility.",1182297600,3,526,5.426829268292683
7935242,5,B00005ABVH,"I looked forward to receiving this film from the moment I ordered it, having a great interest in early European Cinema, particularly French and German Cinema, this was going to be a treat to behold.

I had no worries about the lack of extras, or a glossy booklet, the original French titles were enough, then I heard the voice! All of the titles and inter-titles are spoken in English, aaaahhhhhrrrrggghh! Imperialistic, cultural vandalism. This is a French film, and a silent french film at that. To watch it is like having an idiot sat behind you who talks all the way through the film, I was waiting for him to tell me the ending just before it happened. I cannot imagine the thought process that came up with this.

In summary, a great film, a visual treat, but totally ruined.",1174608000,8,781,4.571428571428571
7935243,3,B00005ABVH,"I can't believe I'm writing a negative review of a French classic I should revere! But here are the facts. Since my childhood, I have been impressed by a still in Henri Agel's ""Histoire populaire du cinma"" depicting Madeline's funeral from this film. It shows black-clad gentlemen in stove-pipe hats photographed from a distance carrying a coffin, surrounded by cathedral-like trees with the superimposed image of lighted candles adding to the solemnity. I was impressed by both the technical achievement and the atmospheric result. Unfortunately, if ever there was a film whose stills are superior to its viewing, this is it! Watching this pristine print for the first time, I was disappointed by many elements: the tampering with Poe's story (where his themes boil down to Roderick's poor choice of real estate), the imitation of Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" (arrival at the inn, reluctance of peasants to drive the newcomer to the estate); the expressionistic acting (it's really very, very bad); the gratuitous quirkiness (books cascading off their bookshelves, windows that stay open at all times even during a full storm, a revived woman we are expected to believe has walked a great distance and even swam a lake after waking up in a family tomb miles away from her castle, a doctor whose character or purpose is never explained, copulating frogs, an owl that may or may not be stuffed); the overwhelming feeling of boredom; the shoddy artistic direction, especially in the use of miniatures to suggest the castle and its demise, the night sky, the bogs, the fog,  the storm, etc., all bad. Worst of all, perhaps, is the music on this DVD by Roland de Cand (not ""Rolande de Cande"" as written up everywhere) which is an unoriginal hodge-podge of borrowings from undistinguished recordings of John Fahey-like mediaeval music and electronic-sounding ""madhouse"" noises (probably pinched piano wires) that sound atrocious and misguided and rob the film of any gothicness, dignity or solemnity it might have preserved otherwise. ""Pellas et Mlisande"", this ain't! The only way it could have been made worse, I suppose, would have been commissioning Philip Glass to write a little something (brrrr!). The film is interesting because of its historical value, its photography, editing and superimpositions, which may or may not have been daring for the time - but in 1928, I seriously doubt it. That does not make it a masterpiece and not even a film I'd like to own or watch twice.",1122336000,6,2471,5.056372549019608
7935244,2,B00005ABVH,"looked like some people got together after drinking all weekend and decided to 'make a movie'. it just looks [poorly made], and the music just doesn't do anything to conjure any mood other than dry boredom.",1049414400,,206,4.75
