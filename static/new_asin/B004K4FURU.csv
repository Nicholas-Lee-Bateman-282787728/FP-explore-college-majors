8432305,4,B004K4FURU,"Angels Memories: The Greatest Moments of Angels Baseball history is a solid and well produced 84 minute documentary from MLB Productions about the 50 year history of the LA/California/Anaheim/LA Angels baseball team.  The film starts in 1961 and goes up to the 2011 season, so alot of the newer material is really fresh.

The film covers alot of interesting content in it's 84 minutes from the inception of the franchise to star players joining the team and great highlights from the Angels 50-year history.  If your a fan of the Angels, this is a solid watch.

However, what hurts this documentary is the very uneven editing, which causes some of the content to be repeated in different segments.  For example, the death of Nick Adenhart is mentioned twice in the film along with Wally Joyner joining the club and becoming a rookie phenomenon.  If the Producers of this film would have produced the content chronologically instead of creating categories pertaining to key moments in Angels history, I think it would have flowed better.

Overall, if your a baseball fan and a fan of the Angels, this is a worthy purchase.",1334534400,2,1121,4.868421052631579
8432306,5,B004K4FURU,"This item delivers! I felt like I was there again through all the years that I have followed my beloved team. Some seasons I cried, some seasons, were just better forgotten, but...the memories of 2002 and winning the World Series gave me goosebumps all over again. I will watch it over and over again when I want to remember all those at bats, pitches and outs. The cheering was infectious!",1325203200,2,390,4.585714285714285
8432307,3,B004K4FURU,This DVD can be sad and heartbreaking at times due to the content...i.e. the tragic deaths of Angels players and the choke jobs in October...But if you're a longtime and Angels fan it's great to see highlights of accomlishments and of course finally getting a World Series win...But it felt a bit uneven at times as it seems the DVD was going to start off chronolically but then it starts jumping around...Bonus footage is nice because of the player profiles but it would have been great to include some original broadcasts of importan moments like pennant clinchers and important at-bats...Overallgood but not great...,1317254400,5,619,5.019417475728155
