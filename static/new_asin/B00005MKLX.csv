7946024,4,B00005MKLX,"A cast of talented unknowns star in this very well choreographed fight-fest, a late entry in the old-school kung fu genre.  Plenty of action and a good sense of humor without being anything close to a comedy.  Yes!  The plot seems complicated but it's easy enough to follow.

The film starts with a brief history of Tai Chi Chuan.  The viewer is then thrust into a military attack on a small martial clan, as ordered by an evil general.  There are 4 survivors, including the Patriarch/ex-general and his two sons, who swear revenge when they find out their Matriarch was killed.  When the boys confront some of the attackers, their father is injured trying to bail them out but they are saved by a Shaolin monk.  While he lay dying, the dad explains that one of the boys is not his son, and that his real father was also a general who was killed by the same evil general over a case of wicked jealousy.  The boys swear revenge again and hide in a cave to train.  While out gathering food, the boys witness two girls dancing and sneak in for a closer look.  They are caught peeping and the girls inform them that they are actually practicing Tai Chi.  The girls' father eventually informs the boys that he too is a former general who is hiding out from the evil general and wishes to train them both in Tai Chi.

While pretty sweet, there is one thing I found particularly annoying:  The good guys (and gals) will attack; realize they are outnumbered; then retreat... again and again.  This equation plays itself out at least half a dozen times.  It does make for more fight scenes and a frequent change of scenery so I probably shouldn't complain.  They eventually take shelter in the Shaolin temple, which makes for some awesome scenes when the bad guys show up looking for them.  Scenes that make one think this could almost be a mainland Wushu film.

This is one of the better discs offered by Tai Seng's Martial Arts Theater.  It is full-screened and English-dubbed with no special features but the picture quality is pretty good with little-to-no squinting during night shots.  Other than Sammo Hung's ""The Victim"", this is the best release of theirs that I've seen and is definitely recommended.

7946025,3,B00005MKLX,"The story line was basic the typical revenge, the characters were fair in their acting ability and the fight scenes were above average some trills. The training sequences were interesting and I liked the villian so 3 stars works for me not a bad movie.",1184716800,,252,4.622222222222222
7946026,3,B00005MKLX,"This video, while adequate, is not in the class of ""T'ai Chi Master.""  There is far too much ""air fighting"" and too little ""ground fighting.""  The sequences, while interesting, do not show the complexity of motion that constitutes T'ai Chi.",1178409600,,240,4.975
7946027,2,B00005MKLX,"The movie starts out with some real tai chi players then goes into standard martial arts. This isn't no Shaw brothers movie. Couple of the training sequences are ok but that's it. And most importantly, not much tai chi application at the last fight seen. If you are a novice, yeah get it.",1133913600,3,288,4.452830188679245
7946028,4,B00005MKLX,"This video both in DVD and VHS format (I have both, having just purchased a DVD copy), is an English dubbed, panned and scanned, old school Hong Kong cheapie done on a very small budget with mostly unknowns.  But it is well worth getting if you like old school kung fu flicks, Tai Chi, and good fighting without wires.  It begins with documentary film clips of Chen Xiaowang, one of the greatest Chen style Tai Chi Ch'uan practioners in the world who is from the Chen Family, the creators and preservers of Chen Style Tai Chi Chuan, the ""mother"" style of all Tai Chi styles.  This is interspersed with documentary film clips of another great Tai Chi practioner whose name slips my mind, but trust me, she too is great.  The film itself uses the classic cliched kung fu film revenge plot of ""you killed my Dad, prepare to die!"", but it carries it out with some fresh touches of humor and style and some great fighting sequences.  The Tai Chi philosophy and principles are addressed with respect and authenticity.  As an amateur practioner of Tai Chi, I can ""feel"" the ""echoes"" of genuine Tai Chi in this movie.  The locations are sort of haunting and the acting is not bad. There is some classic Hong Kong filmmaking visual ""chutzpah"", most especially a fight scene featuring dozens of bad guy drones in brightly colored costumes running around in color coordinated circles, conducted by the had bad guy, the evil general.  It is like some sort of Busby Berkley nightmare: strangely beautiful, beautifully strange.  The dubbing is the typical over-the-top English voice over dubbing, but is not as bad as some and is better than many.  It would be nice to have a wide screen version of this movie, but this flawed panned and scanned dubbed, mono  print is most likely as good as it will ever get.  And again, if you are a fan of this genre, this is a must have--at the very least it is a must see.",1026172800,24,1896,4.544117647058823
