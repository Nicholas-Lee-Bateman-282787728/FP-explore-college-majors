8388865,5,B0035CP4LA,"If you're a fan of Robotech/Macross, you'll appreciate Tekkaman Blade because both offer a compelling story with adult themes, heart wrenching moments, and characters that develop as the series progresses (all of whom are actually interesting). What makes Tekkaman Blade an enduring series is not the animation (which was fine for its day) but its story and characters. The main character, D-boy/Tekkaman Blade, is burdened with the responsibility of destroying Radam lest they enslave the Earth and this means, killing friends and family who are also Tekkamen. The beginning of the series is admittedly, a little slow. However, once D-boy's twin brother and main nemesis is introduced, the action and drama heats up. The dramatic tension and themes are not what you would expect from a `cartoon' and this is what captivated me sixteen years ago when Teknoman first aired in Australia - and yes, this is anime but in the 90s it was dismissed as a cartoon. Tekkaman Blade set the bar very high as far and my thanks to the creators is eternal. They need a bit of a kick up the bum for what they did with Tekkaman Blade II (what were they thinking with Yumi?!) but Tekkaman Blade has a unique story and cast of characters that I still love.

I was fortunate to have seen Teknoman (the International version with David Thomas as Blade and Kerrigan Mahan as Ringo, different to the axed US version) in 1996 and enjoyed it three years in a row. Then the Pokemon/Digimon/etc craze invaded and I lamented the loss of anime with a story and characters that blew me away. Eventually, a subtitled DVD release appeared on eBay a few years later and they were DODGY. Yet, they were the full 49 episodes of Tekkaman Blade with incredibly bad English (and Chinese subtitles that I cannot comment on the quality of as I do not speak Chinese) subtitles. However, the specials Burning Clock, Missing Ling, and Twin Blood were included (without subtitles) and I was desperate for more Tekkaman Blade footage so I put up with the dodgy subtitles. Recently, one of those DVDs decided to go AWOL and I needed a replacement. To my surprise, Anime Works released the full series of Tekkaman Blade on DVD with quality subtitles. HUZZAH! The three specials have also received the subtitle treatment and I finally understand what Aki was saying to D-boy in `that' scene of Missing Ling. If you're after a full set of high quality subtitled Tekkaman Blade episodes, including the specials, then buy this complete collection. You won't be disappointed.

To the Tekkaman Blade virgins considering whether or not to part with their money: yes, you'll find the artwork inconsistent (they had a few different teams working on the one series back in the day) and dated (this was created in 1992); yes, you'll find the recycling of battle scenes a little tedious in the first couple of episodes; BUT it gets better! Characters develop! The story evolves and it's awesome. To the Tekkaman Blade veterans who have either only seen Teknoman (US or International) or haven't seen the series in a while: why are you hesitating?",1335916800,6,3087,4.833648393194707
8388866,4,B0035CP4LA,"Firts off I love this series and its a great old school anime, well not that old i guess. I saw this set come out and thought instead of buying all three collections one by one I would get the whole set at once. I am not gonna say that this is not the way to go unless you already have the individual collections but the packaging itself is the only complaint I have here. Just like the berserk collection animeworks or anime works however its said has really cool artwork on the discs themselves and the packaging LOOKS good but the quality is where it lacks. Along with the overlapping disc packaging(which i know most people hate), the disc dividers are cheap and when i got them in the mail they were all broken from the bottom hinge and now they all sit there stuffed in the plastic case that doesnt shut even most of the time, awesome!!!! Not mentioning i think im going to completely destroy the discs when I try to take them out cause of the overlapping disc storage thing they seem to think saves space i guess, but im lucky that the discs were not destroyed when shipping. Basically what I am trying to say is that I would strongly reccommend picking this up, but try to pick it up in stroe like at FYE they always have sets like this and maybe best buy. I know it will be cheaper here but if you get a damaged set it may cost more in the end with sending it back and shipping and all that other crap, so be warned. Other than that not a series to be missed for anime fans",1282089600,6,1482,4.167247386759582
