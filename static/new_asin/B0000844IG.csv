7978901,5,B0000844IG,"Just a great drama/comedy with terrific banter and twists and turns. One of my favorite Michael Madsen movies. Madsen is recently released from prison and comes from a blue color background. He is a terrific poker player and Patricia Arquette shines as a spoiled rich girl whose family is in the MOB. Billy Bob Thornton has a nice role in one of his early movie credits. There are touching moments, laughter, shootouts and revenge. I think this is a most underrated movie that I saw on one of the premium channels years ago and taped via VHS. You will enjoy this movie and will not be disappointed with any part of it.

7978902,5,B0000844IG,"This little known (unknown to me) movie I chose because I really like Patricia Arquette and Michael Madsen in general. I thought
it would be an okay fun movie. It's a GREAT fun movie. Love it - what a find!",1289520000,,206,4.175
7978903,2,B0000844IG,"Trouble Bound (1993) scores points for entertainment value and a
convincing dream-like quality to the story from a litany of
implausible situations and risible events.

It also has a hip and joyful soundtrack from start to finish,
resminicent of numbers from Johnny Guitar Watson or Guitar Slim,
other mini-moog and Miles Davis Quintet numbers, etc.

This is a road movie, comprising various elements, ranging from
texas hold'em poker games, provocative strippers, bar fist fights,
a beating victim in the trunk needing to be disposed of, and a
treasure hunt for a high roller's stash of cash, in between mob
gang rivalry.

The picture is also a comedy of sorts, not shy in actively urging
viewers see the lighter side of various absurd yet lethal
confrontations, some with gunplay, or concerning the rapport
between Michael Madsen's character, (a decent card player), and
Patricia Arquette chatterbox, 18 year old character,  somehow
showing a juvenile set of mind,  reminiscent in some ways to Kate
Winslet.

Billy Bob Thornton and Seymour Cassel add texture to the story, and
more credibility.

The humor does well, often from over the top situations, such as
the meeting held between Arquette and her grandma -  the appearance
almost  a parody of the original Godfather movie from its
suddenness or clear-break  at a mansion estate in the context of
the action. Another example is the exaggerated profanity which is
risible, especially in the gangland climax of the movie,  and taken
in context with a large number of comical earlier moments.

This movie  could have been improved  with a wide-screen, but it
isn't the case as it seems designed for the high school crowd based
on the dialog,  although the story is more mature than that,
centering on the underworld, gambling, showgirls, the mob, etc.

In sum, this is an obviously entertaining Hollywood and TV style
movie, underlining an imaginary world, comical, relaxed and
appealing to the child in every man and woman. Worth seeing.",1266969600,5,1992,5.0830769230769235
