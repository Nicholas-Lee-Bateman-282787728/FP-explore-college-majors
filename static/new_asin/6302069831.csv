426425,5,6302069831,"I exercised to this video when I was a kid and kept it as a teen. We lost it somehow and I finally found it again. Now I jazzercise with my 2 year old and restart the tradition! So glad to have it again. It is old-fashioned, but it is a great overall full-body workout and stretch. Gotta love the old songs too!",1296691200,3,311,3.9523809523809526
426426,4,6302069831,"I am so glad I found this tape. It is very hard to find things on VHS anymore, but this workout is one I had been searching for for quite some time. It was fantastic shape and came in only three days. I was so glad!",1269302400,,215,3.6956521739130435
426427,3,6302069831,"Good for its time, but if you want to experience Jazzercise the way it is in 2009, get a newer video.",1260921600,,101,3.857142857142857
426428,5,6302069831,"This is seriously the most fun you could ever have while working out.  I don't think it's a very strenuous workout, but a couple of the routines can be a good workout...and it's definitely a good overall stretch for the body.  My favorite part is when she brings in the ""two cute guys"" who are a bit rotund with crazy 80s haircuts.  It's amazing!!!  I love it!  I just wish I could get it in DVD form because I no longer have a VHS player.  :(",1234656000,3,443,4.093023255813954
426429,4,6302069831,"This Jazzercise is the 1982 original version.  Note:  It is the 1982 version.  The setting background is completely white and at times, various different exercisers/leaders appear as they focus on toning parts of the body.

What you will see here are exercises that are effective and not performed anymore.  These are what you don't see out of today's exercise gurus.  It's dated!  Yes, the people appear rather dated, clothes included.  As mentioned, there is variety in scenery and people, except the white background remains.

You can't hear the music much, it is very low, actual songs, although most likely not original singers.  Song titles are displayed on screen, as well as level of exercise and the body parts you will focus on.

Some tunes are note original singers, but at least it is acceptable music:  ""Papa was a Music Man"", ""Upside Down"", ""Seduced"", ""Move Your boogie Body"", ""JavaJive"", ""After Midnight"", ""Baretta Theme"", ""You're Sixteen"", ""Sweet Nothins"", etc., etc.

Judi Sheppard Missett, founder of Jazzercise, blabs quite a bit throughout the exercises.  But incorporated is a sequence of warm-up, stretching and cardiovascular routines

If you are into Jazzercise, the best tape is the 1994 version where an entire large room of people join for some good workouts.  Otherwise, try it, you just might like this one!  Approximately 56 minutes.",1045785600,30,1363,5.178899082568807
426430,5,6302069831,"My mother had this video when it first came out. When I was younger, her and I Jazzercised together.  When I became pregnant with my two children (different pregnancies) I felt fit and the routines were easy to do.  They even have a split screen for high impact and low impact, so you know what to do for either one.  My doctor thought it was a wonderful exercise for me, as long as I stayed with low impact, and he even recommended it to other patients.  I still do Jazzercise today and sweating it up with "" Wake Me up, before you go go"".",1028505600,8,540,4.163461538461538
426431,5,6302069831,"Jazzercise is the classic that really, IMO, started it all.  It's easy to follow and fun to do, which is all that you need in an exercise video.  It even has a handy heartrate chart on the box, which you can use to determine whether your exercise is too strenuous or just right.",1021593600,3,278,4.226415094339623
7821430,5,6302069831,This package came quickly and well packaged! I was so excited to do this with my little one and show my mom as she used to do this tape with me when I was really little. My whole family ended up being so excited to see it. I didn't realize what a workout it was! I am a little overweight and just getting back into shape after 2kids but still this is a really great workout! It's almost an hour long and you use your body a lot for resistance. I was drenched in sweat at the end! The tape had no skipping and was in good condition. Very happy!,1480291200,,543,3.9454545454545453

7821433,4,6302069831,"I love the old Jazzercise! I had the original 33 rpm album years ago, and had put on cassette. My daughter and I both knew it by heart! This tape arrived quickly, and is in decent shape. The sound fades out in a couple of places, but definitely still doable. Very happy!",1433462400,,270,4.211538461538462

7821435,5,6302069831,Quality was as advertised.  Customer service was very good.  The tape & CD was as I remembered it from many years ago.,1401580800,,118,4.318181818181818
7821436,3,6302069831,This is an older tape.  It would be what I think of as a totally low impact workout.  No jumping whatsoever and fairly basic moves (normally the workout is high impact with an option to do low - this has no high impact at all)  Also somewhat canned music.  But it did get my heart rate up and the floor section was good.  A good workout to get back into shape with but not terribly challenging if you are already there.,1396828800,2,419,4.1234567901234565
7821437,3,6302069831,Did this when I was n high school. We had the record. Thought it was same thing but the routines are different. Would have helped for more information was given on what routines was actually on the tape.,1387152000,,203,4.368421052631579
7821438,5,6302069831,"Jazzercise is the best thing since instant pudding.  Go for the gold and look great doing these exercises, you won't regret it!",1370304000,,127,4.7727272727272725
7821439,5,6302069831,I love this VHS I bought this for my mom for her birthday late Nov 2011 and Ive got to say when she saw what I bought it brought tears to her eyes.....so many memories i remember when I was young I used to do the exercises with her myself personally I'm going to buy another copy for myself very soon highly recommend,1323129600,,317,4.0476190476190474
