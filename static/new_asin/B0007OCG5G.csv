2223818,5,B0007OCG5G,"Homophobes beware, this unfortunately will make you physically sick or uncomfortable at any rate. But if you are comfortable with your own hetero sexuality, then you are in for a treat & a stimulating cinematic experience.

First a word about Sarita Montiel. How incorrect to compare her to Mae West. A better comparison would be equal parts Natalie Wood & Jennifer Lopez, both sexy & beautiful brunettes. Both her singing & beauty make it worthwhile to explore her music & film catalogue which are both extensive, if not in Amazon as far as films are concerned, then use google.com to find her rarer films, esp. the one which the boys are seeing when they have their ""sinful"" little moment, ""Esa Mujer."" ""La Violetera"" is an essential film of hers, as well.

Pray it isn't so, but if Almodovar never makes another film, his cannon will have been more than complete with this crowning masterpiece. It's almost as if Almodovar has been patiently making films about straight women & their day-to-day angst (Women on the Verge...,  Tie me up, Tie me Down, & Kika). Or including everyone he can, straight men in love with silent women (Talk to her). Or impotent men obsessed with revenge (Live Flesh). Now that he has the international acclaim, he can make the film he wanted ""Law of Desire"" to be, but as he was then a relative unknown in world cinema, he had to wait 20 years for the time to be right for the audacity to make a film like this.

This is one to cherish for years to come as a funny, erotic, complex & thrilling film that will only leave you at dreamtime if you have conquered the dream-making machine itself.",1101254400,12,1621,4.598615916955017
2223819,5,B0007OCG5G,"Pedro Almodovar is a master at what no other director can achieve, bringing out the simpathetic side of the most tragic and obscure scenes and characters.

If there is something this movie lacks is female characters and is a pity: no other director in the world can get inside of a woman's flesh the way he does and direct the most natural representations of women in all of their different facets.

Bad Education is about the trials and tribulations of an abused child, his cinical and damaged brother, a director hooked on an early infatuation and the priest who touches or destroys their lives. Gael Garcia confirms his strong perfomance, both as a tormented hetero forced to enter the homo lifestyle. Jimenez Cacho delivers one of the strongest and most haunting performances in cinema history representing a very rigid priest who gives in to his most obscure desires.

Almodovar ties strong perfomances, colorful characters, cartoonish sets and takes the viewer in a very noir trip to the sexual drives of a very damaged group, accomplishing what he always do, show the lighter and darker sides of the most terrible situations.",1099785600,15,1132,4.947368421052632
2223820,5,B0007OCG5G,"This is the movie that confirms Gael Garcia Bernal's status as the most erotic male screen presence since Alain Delon doffed his shirt in ""Plein Soleil.""  In this film he plays at least three characters, including Zahara, a drag queen, for which portrayal Pedro Almodovar, the director (who has a cameo in the film as a poolboy) has compared Bernal to Julia Roberts.  Think sensuous lips.  But most viewers, I believe, will prefer him as Juan, doing pushups on the floor of his brother's kitchen, or as Angel, diving into a swimming pool in his underwear.  But even as Juan, in sunglasses at a museum in Valencia, Bernal may remind discriminating filmgoers of Barbara Stanwyck, in the famous grocery sequence in ""Double Indemnity.""  Which brings me to an important point: Almodovar's film is many things--part autobiography, part exploration of sexuality--but it is above all a film noir, despite its bright colors, with Bernal as the ""homme fatal.""  I think it works.  Any fan of the genre will be familiar with its conventions: the reversals and betrayals, the characters who change names and even faces, the flash-backs and flash-forwards, the self-defeating ethical codes.  Forget the Franco-era politics, if that's a stumbling block, and focus on the roller-coaster plot.  And if the reappearance of the child-molesting Father Manolo as a sympathetic family man and victim of Juan's undeniable mystique bothers you, then do as the director and suspend judgment.  This is topnotch cinema, by a master at the top of his form.",1092873600,177,1528,5.076
2223821,4,B0007OCG5G,"Like all of Almodovar's films, this one is filled with bright colors, deep emotions and complex characters.  I saw this movie when I was in Seville in it's original Spanish version, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is interesting in that it approaches the issue of homosexuality in the era of the Franco dictatorship without actually politicizing the issue.
For those people who have never seen an Almodovar film, the obtruse presence of sexuality in nearly all the characters may seem somewhat disturbing.  But since this is the driving force behind the characters in this movie, it has to be present or the film would make no sense.
This movie, as well as other Almodovar movies, has the characteristic of humor mixed with serious tension.  Every five minutes, or so, one of the characters would say something funny, which prevented an overload of tension and kept the movie interesting.
The movie had so many twists and turns, and was so far removed from typical that I was entertained every moment that I watched it.  This is a movie for people who are looking for something ""different"" yet entertaining because it doesn't fit into any of the typical U.S. movie genres but it's strangeness kept me intrigued until the credits.",1089763200,14,1228,4.884615384615385
2223825,2,B0007OCG5G,"This is one of those films that is supposed to be shocking but ends up just being silly. Obviously getting Garcia Bernal into the cast was a coup for the Director (the ever uneven Almodovar) but he could do little with him except putting him into soft-core gay porn situations that had the emotional depth of three day old taco.  More of a camp romp through transland than a meditation on the human condition (or the very real tragedy of priestly pedophilia or drug addiction which Almodovar turns into a weird kind of burlesque), Bad Education succeeds in presenting some great cameos from the Euro drag-scene but little else.",1483488000,,627,4.752293577981652

2223835,5,B0007OCG5G,"Dazzling is the word for Pedro Almodvars 15th feature Bad Education (La mala educacin, 2004), the fifth of six mid-to-late masterpieces that start with The Flower of My Secret (1995) and finish with Volver (2006). A self-reflexive tale of film director Enrique Goded (Fele Martnez) adapting a childhood memoir authored by his friend Ignacio Rodriguez (Gael Garca Bernal), the film spans a-chronologically three time settings, over five texts told by five narrators (one of them unreliable) and amounts to a virtuoso celebration of story-telling that works on multiple layers of understanding. If not finally as moving for the heart as it is as stimulating for the brain, the film is an overpowering statement of Almodvars worldview, a view which to date has been spelled out with admirable and thoroughly consistent artistic integrity over 19 films in almost four decades. A few words need to be said about this worldview before I get to the film. Those already familiar with this wonderful film will immediately draw parallels.

Almodvar is deeply connected with post-Franco Spanish society and the way a country and its people adapted (and are still adapting) from fascism to democracy. Franco died in 1975 and the first General Election was held in 1977. Technically Spain democratized overnight, but in reality the transition was long and torturous, the tension between right and left which led to the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) extending through to this very day. Almodvar has always been on the left wing of the political spectrum and his feature films made in the wake of the collapse of a dictatorship can be read as both an attack and a celebration. The attack is on Francoism, a male chauvinist patriarchy perpetuated by the state-sponsored Catholic Church, brutally upheld by the justice system and by twisted authority figures. The celebration is of freedoms won with the advent of democracy including freedom of speech, freedom of movement, rights for women and sexual liberation. Sometimes the politics are stated explicitly. At the end of Live Flesh (1997) Victor exclaims, The Spanish have lost their fear and the general thrust of any given Almodvar film is the birth of freedom and love out of restriction and hate, the surge from darkness to light (from fascism to democracy) lying in the background even of the films in which politics and history appear to be absent.

The two main themes running through this attack and celebration are transition and identity. Everything in Almodvar is fluid and in a state of flux with a country and its people forever changing and searching for some kind of identity to move forward and achieve stability/security. This transition and identity is addressed in three key areas; in the area of politics and society (what does being Spanish mean?); in the area of the body and sexuality (as a repressed homosexual growing up under Franco we can understand how important sexual emancipation was both for Almodvar and also a great many other people irrespective of their sexual orientation); and in the artistic creative process itself (writing as well as filmmaking as expressed by a fascination with story-telling, cinema history and a very knowing postmodernism). The films variously focus on any one of these areas without ever losing sight of the other two. All About My Mother (1999) miraculously manages to balance all three in almost equal proportion, but with a subtle emphasis given to matters bodily. In that film the character Agrado utters a statement from the very heart of Almodvars worldview. Justifying her trans-sexuality (the embodiment of transience) she says: You are more authentic the more you resemble what youve dreamed you are. The resounding applause accorded her by the audience and by Almodvar himself of course tells us that this director asserts the right of everyone to be able to be who they want to be in an emancipated state in a world without a closet. In Talk to Her (2002, the film preceding Bad Education) Almodvar shifts the emphasis almost completely onto transition and identity search within the body with all four central characters existing in closets of isolation/loneliness either of their own making or imposed by external circumstances. In Bad Education the emphasis is placed firmly onto transition and identity search within the artistic creative process with politics/society and body/sexuality both clearly in the mix as well.

Almodvar worked for over a decade on the script for this film and he is on record saying it is heavily autobiographical and probably his most personal project to date. I don't think there is a single Almodvar film which isn't autobiographical to some extent, but clearly with Bad Education he speaks the most directly about himself and his formative experiences. A lot of what we see in the earliest segment of the film (1964 when the director would have been 15 years old) is rooted in his own experience of growing up in a Catholic school. He played the games and did the activities shown, singing in the school choir as well. Both the riverside seduction and the sacristy sale really happened to his peers, the character of Father Manolo a conflation of two real people. The depiction of Enrique Serrano in 1977 is quite possibly how Almodvar was at that point, a homosexual trapped in a suffocating small town before his move to the big city. Fast forward to 1980 and Enrique Goded is clearly Almodvar himself as he would later become in 1987 with The Law of Desire  a successful film director in charge of his own company leafing through newspaper cuttings for artistic inspiration.

Coming out of autobiography Almodvar lays out his three areas of transition and identity search. His second film to work within a specified historical timeframe (the first was Live Flesh), the politics are clearly spelled out with the dates we are given  1964*, the era of Francoism before the General Election; 1977, the very year of the General Election and the end of fascism; and 1980, the year of Pepi, Luci, Bom, Almodvars first feature emblematic of La Movida Madrilea, the counter-culture renaissance group associated with attacking lingering Francoism and celebrating the new found democratic freedoms. Francoism was enforced by the state-sponsored Catholic Church and the friendship we see between the two boys, Ignacio (Nacho Prez) and Enrique (Ral Garca Forneiro) on one level represents free Spain crushed by the male chauvinist patriarchy of the Franco establishment as represented by the priests running the school, the school itself serving as a symbol for Francos Spain. Almodvars attack on Francoism lies in his depiction of the priests, especially Head of State Father Manolo (Daniel Gimnez Cacho) and his Minister of the Interior henchman Father Jos (Francisco Maestre). Manolo sexually abuses Ignacio and has Enrique expelled for being too close to his object of desire. This forced splitting (emphasized by Enrique leaving while all the kids are lined up and practicing regimented exercises in the school yard only for Ignacio to break the ranks by turning to watch his friend) is the most tragic event of the film and the motor for all the melodrama concerning blackmail and murder which comes later. The message is clear  a country has been perverted by the sinister action of those in authority (the Franco years) resulting in years of doubt and uncertainty as Spanish people try to re-negotiate their identities in the rubble of a collapsed dictatorship. The General Election of 1977 clears the way for those injured or repressed under Franco to express themselves. Ignacio returns to his old school to blackmail Manolo, his ambitious brother Juan goes for his dream to be a successful actor by leaving his hometown and taking up studies in Valencia. Enrique goes to Madrid and carves himself out a successful career as a film director (Almodvar himself of course). Francoism over and the stranglehold of the Catholic Church loosened, Father Manolo finds himself out of a job and takes up a new career as a literary editor under the assumed name of Sr. Manuel Berenguer. His homosexuality continues to push for expression and while in the school it could be channeled into abuse of boys which could be kept quiet (ie; in the closet), in the new democratic climate, the closet becomes impossible and the end result is self-destruction  he loses his family and he ends up resorting to blackmail to satisfy his lust. The aggressor becomes the victim as fascism gives way to democracy. As per the usual dark-into-light Almodvar pattern, the figures laid low by fascism eventually triumph and the figures representing fascism perish.

Transition and identity search within the body is closely connected with the politics. Under Francoism the dream of being free to resemble what youve dreamed you are is denied by the Catholic repression of homosexuality as shown by the sad story of what happens to Ignacio and Enrique at school. Homosexuality can only be expressed by authority figures who have the power not only to hide their deeds, but also alter the way innocent people grow up and negotiate their lives. What Manolo perpetrates on the two boys represents in microcosm what the Franco establishment perpetrated on a whole nation. The confusion this leads to gets perfect representation in Ignacio returning to his old village and school as a transsexual. This looks back to Tina in The Law of Desire (a scene from which providing the original seed for Bad Education), Judge Dominguez in High Heels and both Lola and Agrado in All About My Mother. All of these transsexual characters are the result of abuse heaped onto them in the past and only in the cases of Dominguez and Agrado are identity/gender issues resolved for the better. Tina and Lola end up lonely and dead respectively and poor Ignacio finds himself a victim not only of the evils of the past, but of the competitive ambition of the present as well. The flip-side of drug-fuelled excess (two responses to the social change heralded by the 1977 General Election), this competitive ambition also plays out in bodily terms through the sexual relationship struck up between the returned Ignacio now calling himself ngel and Enrique Goded. Both in effect use and abuse each other to get what they want. ngel wants to have his story The Visit made by Goded into a film as well as wanting to play the starring role of Zahara. The film demonstrates how he will do anything to get what he wants, change his identity (his body) as many times as it takes (Garca Bernals incredible versatility well to the fore here), even submit himself to anal sex though it is far from clear if he is really gay. Goded on the other hand lusts after ngels body and wants to make The Visit, but not with ngel as Zahara. Only when he finds out who Angel really is does he change his mind and go ahead with the film. As much as ngel uses Goded, Goded uses him back to get exactly what he wants. Eventually ngel realizes Goded knows everything and asks why he changed his mind. Goded replies, I wanted to see how far you would go and how much I could take. Goded mixes his personal life with his professional life (""plays with his guts"" [Almodovar])here just as Pablo Quintero did in The Law of Desire and (as Almodvar has said in interview) when people do that they will always get burned, the impulse towards artistic expression proving to be as destructive as it is creative.

So far I have tried hard to avoid spoilers, but from this point they are unavoidable

In Bad Education transition and identity search plays out in the arenas of politics and sexuality, but it gets fullest expression in the films spectacular probing at the artistic creative process itself, both writing and filmmaking. The film is an aggressively post-modern text which seeks to present the world as something lying beyond clear understanding. Transience and identity confusion are a given with issues of meta-fiction, inter-textual pastiche, faction and multiple referencing to other art either existing or invented constantly emphasizing that texts only exist within other texts with no clear blue print for explaining it all. Any attempt to explain is in this sense threatening and therein lies a sense of pervasive paranoia, a theme expressed most obviously here by the use of film noir conventions, especially the deployment of Gael Garcia Bernal in multiple roles as the 'femme fatale' of the piece.

Postmodernism has always been a part of Almodvars films, but it didn't get its first real statement until The Law of Desire. It made up the entire subject of Kika (1993) with each character representing a different genre/text. Postmodernism gets its most sophisticated treatment yet here in Bad Education. Meta-fiction and inter-textual pastiche run riot as Almodvar gives us no less than five texts and five narrator doppelgngers who all variously stand for Almodvar. The over-arching main creator (the God) of the text is of course Almodvar himself as the final credit says. This is his film and he is responsible for the creation of all the characters we see and the recreation of much that is autobiographical. The first shot we see after the end credit is another end credit reading, Written and directed by Enrique Goded. The name Goded is very close to Godard as in Jean-Luc Godard and we are to infer that the character who we see at work in his office is a New Wave director, a modernist artist aiming to criticize the cinema of the past (a critique of the past is an important component of modernism), assess it and then add to it with something new. He is of course an Almodvar doppelgnger, but with a subtle difference. Modernism pre-supposes an explanation for everything and Goded is driven towards discovery just as the French New Wave directors thought they were doing in the late 60s. Almodvar however is post-modern in the sense that he sees this drive towards explanation as being false, threatening and even dangerous. He prefers to embrace the basic confusion that engulfs everything and demonstrates in the film how the modernist Goded heads towards personal oblivion in the pursuit of the unknowable even though professionally he emerges as an outstanding success.

The various texts are laid out with incredible skill. Goded narrates most of the 1980 part of the film in which he receives a visit from a man claiming to be Ignacio, an old boyhood friend. Ignacio now wants to be called ngel and gives Goded a story he claims to have written called The Visit. As Goded reads the story we are taken back to 1977 and the narrator changes to Ignacio. The story concerns Zahara, a transsexual on the make with his friend Paquito (the marvelous Javier Cmara). We know Zahara is actually Ignacio because he picks up a boy just outside a nightclub who has the name Enrique Serrano who we infer is the fictional rendition of Enrique Goded. Zahara visits his old school and sees his old nemesis Father Manolo. In Manolos office he threatens to blackmail the priest (he needs the money to carry out a sex change to finalize his 'true' identity) with a story also called The Visit and also signed by Ignacio Rodriguez. As Manolo reads, we are taken back to 1964 and the narrator changes again to Zahara/Ignacio so we have a Chinese box structure of a film within a film within a film within a film  four texts all operating simultaneously. This point becomes clear when we later see Goded finishing making his film of The Visit with the same actors that we first saw as he read the original story earlier on. Almodvar and Goded are doppelgnger directors of the same film and also the two films within their bigger film narrated by Ignacio and Ignacios own doppelgnger in his book. A fifth narrator is added to the scene when Father Manolo turns up on set on the last day of shooting The Visit with the new name of Berenguer and a new actor playing him, Llus Homar. It is through Berenguers narrative that we learn Ignacio (played as an adult by Francisco Boira), who is the real author of The Visit, has been killed by his brother Juan (Garca Bernal again) in a plot with Berenguer, the pair of them having had an affair and wanting Ignacio (a troublesome heroin addict) out of their lives for good. Just before our film Bad Education begins Juan had stolen Ignacios story The Visit and throughout the film he has been pretending to be ngel/Ignacio in order to further his naked ambition. This ambition which involves using Goded is mirrored by Goded using Juan back. Earlier in the film Goded visits Juan/Ignacios home in Galicia and finds out Juans secret (he has swapped identities with Ignacio). He goes ahead and makes a film from The Visit anyway, his naked ambition equaling Juans with the artistic creative impulse sweeping all before it. The only thing he doesnt know is that Juan has killed Ignacio. The desire of both characters to define their own identities through artistic expression is the real motor which pushes the film and both end the film ambiguously. Professional success comes at a price. In the epitaphs we learn that though ngel becomes a famous actor, his past continues to dog him in the form of Berenguer who continues to blackmail him and who he eventually has to kill. Short term success ends in years of TV obscurity. Goded wins fame with his film, but has lost his childhood love Ignacio and with it any personal security. Professional success can only paper over the pervasive sense of transience and sense of identity stolen first by Father Manolo (by Francoist Spain) in his youth and then second, stolen by his own fanatical drive towards artistic creative expression. He is left with just the passion (the word highlighted on the screen in the films final frame) to create and as Almodvar demonstrates with his post-modern text it is best to embrace the confusion rather than seek to explain it.

If all this sounds complex, it is, but then that is the point. Two or three viewings are necessary to understand what Almodvar has done here, but theres no doubting the stunning intelligence as well as the sheer entertainment value lying behind the deft juggling of all the texts, the narrators and the multiple voice-overs. The film really pivots around an amazing treble-performance from Garca Bernal, his multi-identity being the perfect conduit through which Almodvar can play around and question the whole structure of narrative cinema. Not only does he do this through meta-fiction and inter-textual pastiche, but he explores the other post-modern constant of referencing other art, suggesting yet more texts which interlock with the main texts which I have identified. The 1964 and 1977 segments of the film feature heavily the famous Spanish singer/actress Sara Montiel (the future Mrs. Anthony Mann). Here the young Ignacio and Enrique go to the cinema and watch her star in That Woman (Esa Mujer, 1969, Mario Camus) as her character (an ex nun) returns to her old nunnery to receive a frosty welcome. This echoes Ignacio returning to his school in 1977 and the friendship established in secret visits to the cinema which Manolo destroyed. Montiel also sings two songs in the film. We are introduced to Zahara/Ignacio wearing a Jean-Paul Gaultier outfit which fakes a naked womans body as he mimes to Montiel singing Quizs, Quizs, Quizs, and then later Angel wanting to study how to be a transsexual watches Camarero (Roberto Hoyas) mime to Montiels Maniqu Parisien. Almodvar uses Montiel not only because she was iconic in the 60s. She was born in La Mancha just as he was and is therefore part of his 'autobiography.' Sometimes film references are tossed off very casually as Paquito responds to taking drugs with Zahara/Ignacio, Well, its Two for the Road, Two Rode Together. The first is a Stanley Donen romance made in 1967 while the second is a John Ford Western made in 1961, both referring to the friendship between the two and of course to the central relationship between Ignacio and Enrique. The Donen film in particular bears superficial comparison with Bad Education in its spatial and temporal manipulation. Interestingly, Godeds office in 1980 boasts fake posters on the walls, one with the title La Abuela Fantasma appearing prominently in the opening scene when Ignacio/Angel visits. The final segment of the film narrated by Berenguer is dominated by references to film noir as the real nature of Juan's duplicity is revealed. After Ignacio is killed the pair enter a cinema where a film noir season is playing. As they leave Berenguer says, Its as if the films are talking about us with posters to three films clearly visable on the wall  Double Indemnity (1944, Billy Wilder), La Bte Humaine (1938, Jean Renoir) and Thrse Raquin (1953, Marcel Carn). Double Indemnity features even more strongly in the earlier scene in Valencias Museum of Giant Figures where Juan and Berengeur conspire together in a direct quote of the supermarket scene where Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray have their tryst. As Berenguer narrates Almodovar even has him affect MacMurray's cough as Walter Neff gradually dies. The Renoir and Carn films aren't the first to spring to mind to illustrate film noir, but we must remember that for Europeans noir originated out of German expressionism and French realism with Carn in particular often cited as a master of the film type. One thing all three films have in common is that they all feature classic love triangles in which three people are always one person too many. The other important reference is to Patricia Highsmiths Tom Ripley via Rene Clements Purple Noon (1959), Garca Bernals deft identity swapping in his role as Juan/Zahara/ngel playing femme fatale in Almodvars torturous noir-like celebration of narrative. Like an avenging Mephistofeles (the name 'Angel' surely an ironic comment) he rips out the soul of everyone who blocks his ambition.

Bad Education is an intoxicating mix of most of Almodvars favorite themes, and with the various narratives all twining around each other so closely it is an extraordinary feat for him to bring off. The photography (Jose Luis Alcaine returning to Almodovar for the first time since Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!) is incredibly voluptuous with the ripe and rich Almodvar mise-en-scne literally jumping off the screen. We notice meticulous attention has been paid to the exact evocation of the three different times with the acting across the board lying beyond criticism. Garca Bernal received all the plaudits, but we shouldnt ignore the rest of the stunning cast either, the boys being especially well chosen. The evocation of youth by the river is gloriously evoked in slow motion to the strains of 'Moon River' and we are scarcely less convinced elsewhere as the film whirls towards his exhilarating conclusion. Some people have stated themselves less happy with the concluding Berenguer narrative, but not me. My one slight criticism is the same one I have of most postmodern cinema. So much attention is paid to narrative complexity that one feels engaged more intellectually than emotionally. We admire the craftsmanship, but don't really care for any of the characters. We feel for the children of course, but once they grow up, the film is all about use and abuse inflicted on and by all the characters concerned. It is compellingly rendered, but in the end I prefer the comparative simplicity and humanity of Live Flesh, Talk to Her and Volver. Highly recommended nevertheless.

I wish I felt more emotionally, but my mind was always completely absorbed, even if my heart stayed a little cool.  Maybe that's the nature of a film where everyone is hustling and using each other.

(mild spoliers ahead)

The film is a bit obvious and self-conscious in a few spots, and pederastic Catholic priests is a clich the film only partially transcends (although the humanity given to the priest makes it far more interesting), and a couple of the climactic twists feel less motivated than what comes before.  But worth it for the `Vertigo' like layers of reality that keep getting pulled back and forcing us to keep reassessing `good', `bad', `art' and `real.'  Many critics consider this Almodovar's masterpiece - and I would happily watch it a third time.  I think this is the kind of film that only grows on repeated viewings.

2223910,5,B0007OCG5G,"As a disclaimer, it should be stated that that this film is rated NC-17. Mind you, this does not denote that the film in question is pornographic. What this means is that the film is slightly more honest in it's depictions of sex and violence than an R rated film. Over the years, a stigma has developed around the this particular rating, and is often considered the ""kiss of death"" to the films with which it is awarded. Bad Education is rated NC-17 for a scene of explicit sexuality which takes place within the first fifteen minutes of the film. Those who are sensitive to portrayals of homosexual content should skip this film altogether; However, if you happen to be a seasoned cinephile who enjoys diverse cinema, then you owe it to yourself to see Bad Education.

This is one of Pedro Almodovar's best films. It is also one of his most personal films, because elements within the film are autobiographical in nature. This film is told in a complicated narrative structure, which holds the audiences attention. The story is about Enrique and Ignacio, two childhood friends at a Catholic school who fall in love with one another. However, the two boys are forced apart when the pedophilic priest has Enrique expelled, in order to continue his sexual abuse of Ignacio.

Years later, Enrique is now a successful filmmaker who is looking for a new project. One day, a man claiming to be Ignacio shows up at his door with a screenplay entitled The Visit. He says that the screenplay is partly based on their childhood, and it contains a supposedly fictional sub-plot in which the character based on Ignacio blackmails the priest for a million dollars. Enrique decides to take on the project, but suspicions are aroused when circumstances cause him to doubt whether the man claiming to be Ignacio is really who he says he is. From here on, the film delves into a film noir mystery, all the while going back to the ""film within a film"" The Visit.

Bad Education is a film that deals with the consequences of abuse, both physical and emotional - and how the victims carry the burden of that abuse for the rest of their lives. It is not an easy film to watch, nor should it be. The realities presented in this film are not sugar coated for the audience, and this admirable on Almodovar's part.

The acting and direction are amazing here. Gael Garcia Bernal delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Ignacio/Angel/Juan. Fele Martinez is equally impressive as Enrique, and effectively conveys the emotions that his character experiences. Almodovar proves once again that he is a master of the medium, and the music is amazing. Once again, if you are easily offended, the NC-17 rating should be warning enough.

Rated NC-17 for a scene of explicit sexual content. 112 minutes.",1252800000,3,2768,4.746361746361746
2223911,5,B0007OCG5G,"Childhood friends Ignacio and Enrique haven't seen each other in decades, until one day when, out of the blue, Ignacio shows up at Enrique's house with a story that he has written based on their childhood experiences. Ignacio (Gael Garcia Bernal), now an actor, wants Enrique (Fele Martinez), now a director, to turn his story into a movie and cast him in the lead role.

Pedro Almodovar has always set out to provoke audiences with confronting images and themes that are often described as perverted by his detractors, and nothing has changed with ""Bad Education"". In fact, ""Bad Education"" is probably one of the more offensive of Almodovar's movies. If you don't think you can handle a film containing pedophile priests, a very unplatonic relationship between two young boys, transvestite junkies and assorted gay sex scenes, then give up now and try ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" instead (probably the least offensive entry in Almodovar's filmography). However, if you feel that you can handle it, then I strongly recommend this film as it, like Almodovar's other more recent movies, is really amazing.

I started watching Almodovar films after hearing his earlier works compared with the films of John Waters. It is true that Almodovar's earlier films (such as ""What Have I Done to Deserve This?"") are dark comedies in the same vein as those of Waters, but unlike Waters, who never really developed as a filmmaker, Almodovar has transitioned from making films simply for shock value to making films that really have something to say about human nature (although, still have a shock element to them).

""Bad Education"" can be viewed at a number of levels: as a mystery; as a homage to film noir; as a study of the impact of childhood abuse on adults; or as an examination of the different ways in which adults can abuse each other, and I'm sure there are other ways of seeing it, too. Just when you think you've got a handle on the story, it changes, and similarly, just as you think you understand one of the characters, he changes, too. This is particularly the case with Gael Garcia Bernal's character, which is the reason why I love this film so much. The audience's perception of Bernal's character constantly changes throughout the film and I found myself thinking about just who this person really was for days after finishing this film. My fascination with this character is assisted by the fact that he is played by Bernal, who is not just a pretty face, but also an incredibly talented actor. I have enjoyed seeing Bernal in other films (in particular ""Don't Tempt Me""), but to see him working with Almodovar, who has a talent for bringing out the best in his actors, is a real joy.",1224547200,2,2708,4.782051282051282
2223912,5,B0007OCG5G,"Frequently compared to American director, Douglas Sirk, Spain's Pedro Almodovar switches into Hitchcock mode with his twisty, sexually provocative thriller, ""Bad Education"". Maintaining the bright, primary colors that dominate and help define his films, Almodovar ditches his usual comic archness, and amps up the melodrama in a tale piling layer upon layer of desire, deception, betrayal, and lies, with inevitably murderous results.

Star Gael Garcia Bernal shines in the multiple roles of drag queen, Zahara, bad boy Juan, and the ambitious actor, Angel.  A lush-lipped, sensuous film actor, Bernal provides ""Bad Education"" with a throbbing energy that sets the complicated plot(s) in motion.  In 1980's Spain, the boyishly seductive Ignacio arrives at the office of his old, childhood friend, a film director named Enrique.  Ignacio has a script based on their alleged boyhood experiences in a Catholic boarding school, most disturbing of which is Ignacio's continued molestation at the hands of pedophile priest, Manolo.  In the script, Ignacio grows up to become exotic performer, Zahara, who finally returns to the church to confront Manolo, and the demons of the past.  The more Enrique reads of the script, the further the lines between fantasy and reality are blurred.  As Enrique is driven to determine the circumstances surrounding an unexplained death, deceptions are revealed; while some characters are not who they seem to be, others resurface in completely different guises.  The mysteries deepen, with dark, enigmatic Bernal holding the answers, if not all the cards.

The cinematography is up to Almodovar's usual luxe standards, the writing clever and intense, the plot as engrossing as it is unbelievable.  In addition to Bernal's fine acting, Fele Martinez is also excellent in the role of Enrique.  He gives a genuinely moving performance as a man who believes (wrongly) that his long-lost love has returned.  As Father Manolo, Daniel Gimenez Cacho is effectively slick and creepy as a pedophile taking no chances that his crimes will be uncovered, while Lluis Homar (who looks a little like Kelsey Grammer) is convincing as a horny, blackmailed businessman, whose lust propels him into an ill-advised murder plot.

There's a lot going on here.  Because of its myriad plotlines and twists, ""Bad Education"" is a film that demands attention; otherwise, it's easy to become hopelessly lost in, both, the film-within-a-film and the numerous lies that serve as ""backstories"" for the characters.  There's also a ""Vertigo""-like quality to this film, with pedophilia replacing necrophilia as the squirm-inducer.

""Bad Education"" is also a very gay film, probably Almodovar's gayest since ""Law of Desire"" (albeit minus Carmen Maura or that film's over-the-top humor).  Almodovar more often works with a company of women actors, allowing their stories to unfold from a distinctly feminine perspective.  And while I love ""All About My Mother"", ""Volver"", and their sister films, it's interesting to see Almodovar's occasional foray into the testosterone-fueled territory of homoerotica.

While ""Bad Education"" was released with an NC-17 rating, it isn't especially explicit, so I find that rating puzzling.  There is no frontal nudity (except that which is encased in underwear) and the sexual situations are tastefully handled; even the priest/boy interludes are suggestive, rather than in-your-face, no worse than what's been shown on cable television. And aside from the men kissing and some bare behinds, there's not much here that you couldn't see in a PG-13 film, or maybe an R-rated film, at most.  ""Basic Instinct"", for example, is much more explicit than this movie!  The movie ""Towelhead"", in theaters now, reportedly shows more interaction between an adult (male) and minor (female) than ""Bad Education"", so I have to wonder if there's still not a hint of homophobia present in the current rating system.

While not a delicious wallow like ""Law of Desire"", ""Bad Education"" offers a darker, more somber look at the complexity of human behavior and the vaguaries of sexuality.  One of Almodovar's best!",1222560000,,4121,5.3732503888024885

2223915,3,B0007OCG5G,"Pedro Almodvar's individualistic filmmaking style is on full display in this florid 2004 melodrama, but oddly, the heart that propelled the wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talk-to-Her-Hable-con-Ella/dp/B00005JLQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talk to Her (Hable con Ella)</a>&nbsp;seems to be missing. What results is a rather disappointing addition to the otherwise humanistic Almodvar canon, a classic case of style over substance. The convoluted plot begins in the present with an apparent flashback about an episode in the past, then presents that story as a film within the film, and finally the two parallel stories become a hybrid that seems to pay tribute to forties Hollywood film noir.

The focal character is Enrique, a young and successful director who is searching for inspiration for his next production. He receives a visit from an old school friend, Ignacio, who provides it with a short story he brings with him called ""The Visit"". Based on their childhood, it involves Ignacio being sexually abused by a priest at the school they attended together. Indeed, he permitted the abuse in order to get Enrique out of some trouble. Lurid melodrama, as only Almodvar can serve up, ensues, and an imagined reunion occurs between the abusive priest and the two childhood friends and first-loves. Spinning off Enrique's film-set, the director deftly switches narrative voices to make the abuser the victim, and the moral ambiguity of the central characters becomes heightened. Despite the audacious creativity behind the change in perspective and some strong acting, the problem with this approach is that one ends up not feeling much sympathy for any character in the film.

In a dramatic turnabout from his comparatively stoic Ch Guevara in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Motorcycle-Diaries/dp/B00005JNCZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Motorcycle Diaries</a>, Gael Garcia Bernal effectively goes for the audacious in playing Juan/Angel, the homme fatal and struggling, petulant actor, as well as the blonde, sultry Zahara, a transvestite and cabaret singer. But even his efforts are not enough to offset the endless layering of the stories and imagined histories that continue to redirect the story ad nauseum. It's too bad since the basic story feels like Almodvar's most autobiographical film, moving as it does from a Catholic school in 1960s Spain to liberated 1980s Madrid, a period and setting with which the director is personally intimate. He also seems to be making a statement about recent scandals in the Catholic Church where they have willingly turned a blind eye to crimes of abuse against helpless children.

Ultimately, the movie is about his love of depicting erotic role-playing more than anything else and how reality and fiction merge. You will see traces of Hitchcock's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/0783226055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marnie/dp/B000CCW2U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marnie</a>&nbsp;and Billy Wilder's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Indemnity/dp/B00005JNG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Indemnity</a>&nbsp;in the labyrinthine of identities taken on by the characters. The film, nonetheless, falls short of these classics as Almodvar takes on more than he is willing to commit emotionally leaving the viewer with a rather cold feeling at the end. Granted it has all of the director's omnipresent visual flair, including the striking opening titles and the Bernard Herrmann-like music (courtesy of Alberto Iglesias), this is a disappointment for all the talent involved. The 2005 DVD has quite a few extras starting with an informative and very engaging commentary track from Almodvar.

The manuscript tells the story of the boys' friendship in school and what happened to Ignacio(he became a drag queen and a thief).
But it turns out that Ignacio is not Ignacio and that the movie we're seeing is really the movie that's being made and the priest who expells Enrique is also molesting Ignacio and. . . .

We have in this plot, the makings of a complex drama of identity and loss.
The movie falls far short of the promise of the plot. Almoldovar's lighting is depressingly flat and his cinematography one step up from industrial. The effect is to make the characters themselves flat and to rob the actors of their power of expression-the effect is a bit like puppet theatre but without the charm.

Almoldovar was at his best when the edge of witty dialogue cut through the dull conventions of his filmmaking and even provided a contrast to it. In this film, he's attempting to work with action and a multi-leveled plot and the style he uses works against him.

2223922,5,B0007OCG5G,"Bad Education is that rare kind of film that matches stunning cinematography with a twisting, multi-faceted story, and brilliant acting. I guess I'm not supposed to expect anything less from director Pedro Almodovar, but I don't know that much about him or his work (aside from Volver), so I'm still pleasantly surprised.

Bad Education is a multi-layered story, but the title comes from the childhood romance (and I do mean childhood) of two young boys in a Catholic school, one of whom is in a disturbing ""relationship"" with a priest; the kind that are finally coming to light in the last decade. When the two boys begin to spend more time together, one of them is expelled from the school, and the other continues to be molested. This is the ""bad education"" that the title speaks of.

The rest of the film is an intense examination of the effects of such a childhood and the creation of a film based around this childhood. Gael Garcia Bernal is captivating in so many ways in this film, but to reveal too much about his character would be a detriment to the viewer's ability to enjoy the film.

The story plays out in ever more dramatic ways and becomes more and more intense for the viewer and the actors as more information is revealed and more plot twists surface. The story within the story continues to unfold as well, and is equally captivating.

2223937,4,B0007OCG5G,"Gael Garcia Bernal stars along with Fele Martinez as erstwhile schoolmates who reconnect after 16 years in Pedro Alomodovar's ""Bad Education"".  The film depicts a series of bizarre and often inappropriate homosexual affairs and relationships that eminate during the religious school years of the 2 main characters.

Bernal, playing Ignacio shows up unexpectedly at the door of film director and old friend Enrique played by Martinez.  Martinez is in desperate need of some creative inspiration to commence his next project.  When old pal and lover Ignacio offers him a story that he penned called ""The Visit"", he is intrigued.

In flashback fashion, the story plays out and chronicles the experiences of Ignacio in school.  The innocent relationship between Ignacio and Enrique is quashed by the jealous Father Manolo, their literature teacher, played by Daniel Gimenez Cacho.  Father Manolo has yearnings for Ignacio and forces him into a clandestine sexual relationship, which will have major repercussions in the future of both men.  We soon see that a grown up Ignacio has become a female impersonator called Zahara.  Father Manolo has left the clergy and become a publishing executive with a family.

As the film based on Bernal's story is being produced by Enrique, Father Manolo now known as Mr. Berenger reappears to tell his side of the story.  We learn that all is not as it seems as Bernal is not actually who we think he is.  The surprising fate of Ignacio is revealed.

The accomplished Almodovar as is his ilk, weaves a complex tale of relationships that result in a plot that is a mix of drama, intrigue and psychological turmoil.",1148428800,2,1645,5.025830258302583
2223938,4,B0007OCG5G,"Almodovar has been making quite a name for himself recently, and it's easy to see why.  His films can be called daring while still engaging in topics of particular focus and interest in society today.  His characters are willing to be silent when needed, which is a good independent film motif that for some odd reason a lot of filmmakers don't seem to fully understand the power of.  And he uses a somewhat Hitchcockian style to his movies, which is always a good way to boost favor amongst the critics and film snobs.

Furthermore, this film features none other than Gael Garcia Bernal, the strongest actor working Spanish-language films and one of the strongest actors around today.  In short, this film would have had to fail marvelously to be any less than good, and thus it's very damn good.

The storyline itself is a sort of approach that could only be around today, but which has a lot of stylistic roots we've come to accept in the past, mainly from film noir.  When the two characters exit the film noir festival in the movie and say, ""It's like they were us,"" it's not just Almodovar paying homage to the greats of the past, it's him recognizing and expressing exactly what his film IS.

I like it because it's several layers of narrative and narrative-within-a-narrative force me to question how much of it is actually ""true"" in that some of it may be based on real life experiences of Almodovar.  However, I don't know because I don't know anything about Almodovar's biography... and I don't care.  But the point is that the film's narrative style forces us to question it's biographical sources, kind of like a movie like The Matrix or eXistenZ forces us to question our own reality by presenting multiple levels of virtual realms.

On the R-rated version: really, my suggestion to you is to see the NC-17 version.  The R-rated version does a poor job of hiding its imagery and with it's badly produced censorship (including pixellations... ugh...) make it seem more pornographic than the scenes actually are.

Almodovar's film revolves around the suspicious goings-on occuring at a Catholic boys' school. Of course, we have the requisite pedaphile subplot in several scenes, as one of the main characters finds himself gathering the attentions of the head priest. Does anybody else find this situation a little contrived? I mean, can we have a Catholic priest in a film sometime who isn't a pedaphile? Furthermore, I think Almodovar could come up with something a tad more original, without needing to retread the evening news.

For a better introduction to Almodovar's genius, watch ""High Heels"" instead.",1136160000,9,847,5.086330935251799

Gael Garcia Bernal continues to expand upon his recurring roles as an object of desire for both sexes and for priests. He is fantastic in 'Bad Education' especially since he plays several roles, the main ones being Zahara, the transvestite bar singer, and as Angel, an out-of-work actor with an axe to grind. Fele Martinez is incredibly sexy and does a fantastic job as the man caught in the middle of everything. It isn't really Almodovar's best work, but it is still really good.",1135209600,5,714,4.712
2223943,5,B0007OCG5G,"Pedro Almodovar has to be one of the most original and best film directors working today. His latest movie, BAD EDUCATION, is a joy to behold. The photography is stunning from the opening credits to the end of the movie. Shot in beautiful color, many of the frames literally are worthy of framing. Almodovar is one of those rare directors whose films are so visual that they would never translate to any other medium. I'm thinking now, for instance, of the aerial shots of the youngsters doing exercises where the pictures literally become works of art.

Gael Garcia Bernal (Angel/Juan/Zahara) of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES and THE CRIME OF FATHER AMARO also is a living, moving work of art reminding us that a thing of beauty truly is a joy forever. He's not a bad actor/actress either. As he does so often, Almodovar teases the viewer with female impersonators so real that we aren't always certain as to which sex we are seeing. Then there's the story/book within the film, the film within the film, mistaken identity and a swimming pool scene between Bernal and Fele Martinez who plays Enrique that is hotter than Kansas in August -- and perfectly natural-- and apparently the reason for the movie's NC-17 rating. (Only in America would a man's naked butt cause a film to get such a rating while we can see Nicole Kidman's beautiful naked front, back and both sides in a totally gratuituous scene in EYES WIDE SHUT for an R rating only.)

Recalling the unsolicited sexual advances and preteen experiences wrought upon him by his confessor father, he blatantly confronts the priest with his demands. His painful, literal memories are encapsulated in a manuscript entitled 'the visit' which have devastating implications for the priest, should they become grist for the media. Unaware to the priest, the visitor and blackmailer is not whom he seems, nor is he the only victim. The story snares both friend and foe alike within the twisting scheme which involves romantic betrayal, sexual themes and unfulfilled ambitions.

2223956,5,B0007OCG5G,"I love watching foreign films because they tend to be more graphic and straightforward about many issues but that's beside the point. Bad Education is about the classic sources of rage for many: lies, deception, identity theft, sexual ambiguity, and love. This film manages to take us from present to past never losing our interest for a second. The revelations that are constantly revealed in this movie can be shocking for some and a full out party for others. I absolutely loved seeing the actor Gale Garcia Bernal changing between 3 different character types (what a lunatic!) and the actor Fele Martinez try to put the pieces of the sick twisted puzzle together. They both make a great pair in this film and the passion that is expressed in this movie is amazing!

The basic premise of the story is about a long lost love, Angel from Enrique's boyhood showing up with a dynamic script hoping to play one of the main characters Zahara. At first Enrique is more than happy to see Angel but he isn't so anxious to cast him in any movies. Enrique still holding a burning flame in his heart for Angel goes home and starts reading the script which turns out to be part autobiographical and part fictional. Enrique becomes overwhelmed with long lost memories and emotions from his childhood; the story reveals child molestation within the Catholic Church by one of the Padres Manolo (this is no surprise to most of us). After reading the script, Enrique decides to make the movie but refuses to cast Angel as Zahara.

Angel becomes angry and upset by not getting his way but eventually Enrique breaks down and lets him play the part. As the movie progresses on you start to find out that Angel is not who he claims to be and a murder mystery starts to unfold leaving poor Enrique holding on to keep from completely losing control of himself.

I recommend this movie to people who would like to see something outside of the box. People who love a good story and like to be intrigued or possibly shocked! Check this movie out, it's worth a look and take note of the main actors Gael and Fele because they are wonderful. I have seen Gael in Y Tu Mama Tambien (And Your Mother Too), Amores perros (Love's a female dog (curse word really goes there),  El Crimen del padre Amaro (The Crime of Father Amaro), and Diarios de Motocicleta (The Motorcycle Diaries) and he's managed to evoke some strong emotions from me. I started hating him when I saw him in El Crimen del padre Amaro for the horrid thing he did but started back liking him in Motorcycle Diaries. I've seen Fele Martinez in only two films so far: Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) and Darkness. However, I'm currently going to watch Fele in the films Tesis (Thesis) and  Los Amantes del Circulo Polar (Lovers of the Arctic Circle). He adds a unique performance to the movies I've seen so far. I hope to see both of these actors more often. This movie was a real find! It does contain some graphic sexual scenes but that's pretty much it. I don't know what mess is in the NC-17 version. You will not regret checking this movie out!",1128124800,7,3082,4.545945945945946
2223957,4,B0007OCG5G,"What a really great film!  Almodovar treats us to layers upon layers of stories and twists of plot. Everytime a new character enters the story, we see a whole new side of the story. The film also has wonderful twists of direction, for example when you realize the scenes of the drag queen robbing the church are part of a movie, starring one of the characters acting as himself, but who actually is his brother. SOund convoluted?  It certainly is and you will enjoy trying to figure out this dark film.

So what is it about?  I have to say that I think the film is about becoming different people to manipulate and survive. Yet, Almodovar also seems to be warning us that when someone becomes what we want, we should probably suspect blackmail and manipulation. If it is too good to be true, it probably isn't true.

Gael Garcia Bernal plays an actor, who gets to play himself, but actually it is his brother, whom he kills in reality and then plays in the movies. To move ahead he is 'seduced' by an ex-priest who years before molested his older brother. Now why would a beautiful young man film his older middle-aged trick during lovemaking, especially his face, unless it was to blackmail him later?

Gradually we see that Juan, the actor, becomes the lover of a famous director to win a role in a movie.  However, the director, Enrique Godel, is so used to manipulating and using others that he has little trouble kicking out Juan in the end. Even though we see Godel having sex with Juan, we are still not convinced he is gay - he is too slippery to catch.

Almodovar realizes that to reinvent ourselves, we require a story, but just as important, to be manipulated, blackmailed, and exploited, you must fall into that story also. Pretty people create dangerous territory.",1125619200,8,1777,4.583596214511041

Once again Almodovar breathtakingly blends art and controversy; if you're interested in a movie that will evoke fascinating discussion any Almodovar film will do, and this is no exception.

2223961,4,B0007OCG5G,"Bad Education is the film equivalent of a mystery novel that you just can't put down. It is rare in this day and age to see a film that really brings something fresh and intriguing to play - Almodovar has done that with Bad Education. Definitely Hitchcockian in its presentation and delivery, Bad Education is more than something that such a complement provides. Almodovar has created something that is more than any simple homage. He has created something fresh and exciting! - and since Hollywood is unable to do that - Almodovar is at the top of my list for creativity.

Out of nowhere and after 15 or so years, Ignacio (Gael Garcia Bernal) appears at the film office doorstep of his old parochial school crush, Enrique (Fele Martinez). He announces that he is an actor who has written a story about their time in the school and the abuse he suffered at the hands of the cruel priest. Enrique reads the story and we see it play out on the screen. It is a fictionalized version of the reality that Ignacio met while in school.

Enrique agrees to make the story into a film, but refuses to cast Ignacio as the drag queen Zahara in the film. This frustrates Ignacio, who refuses to allow Enrique to make the film unless he is allowed to play the role.
From the start Enrique is suspicious of Ignacio and his intentions - Ignacio was Enrique's first crush and something about Ignacio doesn't feel right. He sets out to investigate and find out what is going on.

I won't say more, because to do so would ruin the beautiful way the story and the mystery plays out.

Gael Garcia Bernal miraculously creates the multiple roles he plays in the ""real"" and ""scripted"" stories in this film. He is a force to be reconed with and I suspect we will be seeing his name on an Academy award before it's over with. Both handsome and erotic all at once, he is a sensual pleasure as both male and female.

The sets and locations are exotic and believable.  The script is tight and engaging.

Ignacio has a manuscript for him to look over, and he hopes to interest Enrique in it. And when Enrique begins to turn the pages of the story, he rewinds their lives. The story is based on the two mens upbringing during a time (1950's) of Catholic Priests' abuse, of love between two boys exploring their sexuality, and of the hypocrisy of adults who are supposed to care for them.

As the film jumps back and forth between Ignacio's and Enrique's upbringing, the script also wedges its way onto the screen, making for an incredibly convoluted story. Then added to this is the fact that Ignacio is not Ignacio; he's Ignacio's brother, Juan/Angel, who is out for revenge, trying to fulfill the final wishes of his brother before his brother ...um ...died. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll stop there.

For those viewers who are not homosexual (like me), this film will probably make you squirm a bit. Now I'm pretty comfortable in my heterosexuality, but this film really gets you into the physical and psychological aspects of being gay. But what it also does is do this in an amazing way: the filming.

Each shot, each frame, each image of this film is so carefully constructed and manipulated that I could hardly pull my eyes away; the dark scenes in the Catholic school, the colorful reds and greens of the gay clubs, the sepia tones of the surrounding ruins near the church, and the list goes on and on and on.

If you're a conservative redneck from Podunk, Iowa, I would highly recommend that you DON'T see this film. If you're a homophobe, you should definitely NOT see this film.

2223964,5,B0007OCG5G,"I can't think of many film directors working today who can pull you into a film so effortlessly and so completely than Pedro Almodovar. Like Hitchcock, whose influence can be felt in this film, you become so absorbed in the story that don't realise how confusing it is until after you've seen it and then try to explain it to someone! Hypnotic and mesmerizing, the film draws you in from the first scene and doesn't let you go. Catholicism, sexuality, identity are just a few of the issues at work in this ""film within a film"" but don't try to over-analzye it, just sit back and enjoy. This is a stunning film, powerful and evocative, beautifully shot with excellent performances - you'll want to see it again to see what you missed the first time around.

About the NC-17 rating - frankly, I don't understand it. There are sex scenes but nothing unusual from what you see in other films and nothing pornographic.

Taking what seems to be a simple story of a lost cross-dressing adult who seeks revenge on his pedophile priest while trying to regain a lost boyhood obsession, Almodovar turns things inside and out, over and over again.  With the plot involving a director, a writer, a determined actor and several different takes on the same scenario, Almodovar surprises and sometimes confuses, but never lets unanswered questions go long without an answer.  The sets and actors intertwine with some of the actors for the real movie story acting in the on-screen movie version.  Instead of confusion, Almodovar creates excitement and curiosity as he brings the viewer deeper into the story.  Yet, just when you think you have it all figured out, the plot changes slightly and thickens.  Director Almodovar also has a keen sense of dark humor especially when parodying film sensors with some `allegedly' sexually explicit scenes.  And.

2223966,5,B0007OCG5G,"This film is incredible. I'm relatively fluent in Spanish and had to make do without subtitles which always tend to detract from the full experience of a film. It took me a couple a viewings to fully understand everything that was said but when I finally twigged, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.

We start off with Enrique, an up and coming movie producer. He's on the look out for a good story and one comes walking right through his door. Turns out his old school friend, Ignacio, who now wants to be known adamantly as Angel, has the perfect solution. He's written a screen play depicting certain points of their lives with added fiction, naturally, and hopes Enrique will consider producing it, with him staring as the principle character Zahra, a transvestite. Sound unusual? We haven't even scratched the surface. When Ignacio and Enrique were boys, they attended a strict catholic boarding school. The two of them were in love, much to the distress of El Padre Manolo, who wanted Ignacio all to himself. One poignant scene is during a field trip. We see the school boys frolicking happily in a lake while hearing a beautiful coir boy rendition of `Moon River'. All of a sudden the song is cut short with Ignacio running out from behind a bush with El Padre in pursuit. Ignacio falls, a rock cutting his forehead. As the blood slides down the centre of his face, we here him remark `I knew that ever since that moment, my life would for ever be divided in two'. After a little mis-hap in the boys bathroom after lights out, El padre Manolo expels Enrique and continues his advances on Ignacio, which is left to the viewers' imagination. The years go by, and they never meet again, until now, back to the present day. Enrique is delighted to have been reunited with his lost love but Ignacio or `Angel' is behaving rather strangely. Not remembering their favourite song from their school days and indeed turning a rather horny Enrique down in a risqu pool sequence (calienta poyas!), something's definitely not right. Angel leaves in a huff and forgets his lighter which conveniently has his hometown address on the side. Enrique journeys to Valencia only to find that *his* Ignacio died 4 years ago and his brother Juan, Stage name Angel, took it quite hard. Part devastated part intrigued, Enrique decides to play along, giving Angel the part and taking him as a lover, all in the desire to find out what makes Juan tick, he's an impenetrable mystery. The story, aptly named `La Visita' has its ending rewritten and as the final dramatic shoot comes to an end Enrique is still at a loss, that is, until he receives a visit of his own!

I'll leave the rest to you; this movie has many intricate threads woven in. A story within a story as they say. The actors are spectacular and Gael Garca Bernal manages to come off as childish, sensual, innocent, conniving and in the end quite chilling, he also makes a stunning drag queen. I recommend this move to anyone that likes a good mystery. I'm on the hunt for the soundtrack. Cmpralo ya!",1116633600,8,3051,4.616942909760589
2223967,5,B0007OCG5G,"This exceptional film is entirely unique in its intensity and depth, but not how I expected. The priestly molestation is rather matter-of-fact, and not dramatized to the extreme as so many movies have done of late. The sex & nudity is very carefully placed, not at all gratuitous (unfortunately-more would have been welcomed albeit unnecessary for the story). In fact I can not tell why this version is NC-17, have Americans really become That Victorian?

Much has been written about the story, what I didn't know prior to viewing was the intensity of plot twists and turns. I won't spoil any secrets here, but suffice it to say that it isn't even the secrets that are so intense, it is the masterful way in which things are revealed. This is really a film about sex as power, and all of the power plays which don't make anyone happy.

Almodovar's direction and cinematography are stunning, erotic, and intensley emotional. He tells so much of the story visually without dialogue. What a treat.

The film ends on a realistic note. There are no firey car crashes, no earth-shattering explosions, no full-frontal nudity, none of the usual supects, but this film sneaks up on you, shakes you to your being, and as you are drawn in by the sensuality and drama, the film demonstrates that life isn't fair, kind, or even very pretty sometimes.",1115596800,6,1337,4.779220779220779
2223968,5,B0007OCG5G,"To see is to believe, some say, yet what one sees in Bad Education should not be trusted, as everything has a sinister characteristic.  All of the characters are ominously sleazy, even the protagonist of the film offers an element of darkness around him, which seems to stem from a criminal background.  This dark theme suggests that the story offers a film noir experience.  However, even the concept of film noir does not give this film justice, as it goes beyond the known borders of this genre while venturing into a new territory.  Pedro Almodvar creates a refreshing cinematic experience that takes sudden turns when least expected while traveling into a dubious world.  Many of Almodvar's previous films offer laughter and contemplation, yet most of them deal with a dubious theme, as does Bad Education. His personal insignia with colorful photography still leaves traces throughout the film, even though it is slightly subdued.

Enrique Goded (Fele Martnez), who some might have seen in the bloodcurdling Thesis (1996), or in the mesmerizing Open Your Eyes (1997), is on the rise in the Spanish world of cinema as he has recently made a successful film.  Nonetheless, he is now struggling to come up with an equal or better idea for his next film when Ignacio Rodriguez (Gael Garca Bernal), from Amores perros (2000), Y tu mam tambin (2001), and the recent Motorcycle Diaries (2004), appears from out of the blue.  Together Enrique and Ignacio used to attend a private catholic school where sexual and physical abuse was predominantly common while the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco heavily tainted the school regulations.  They were close friends, but they also discovered their first love in one another in the unforgiving school run by Catholic priests.  Now years later they reunite, as Ignacio offers him a film script that he has written based on their time at the Catholic School.

At first, the film seems to focus on the Catholic School where Ignacio was a victim of severe sexual abuse, which is told through the screenplay.  This is a clever curveball that Almodvar throws at the audience, but it is necessary to understand what happens as the development of the story rests in the past of Ignacio and Enrique.  However, this review will not elaborate on the notion of what happens next, as it would skew the initial experience with the film.  Nonetheless, the script that Ignacio gives to Enrique portrays a world where Ignacio seeks a way to have an operation to reach what he desires the most - to be a woman.  Cleverly, Almodvar throws out the gender boundaries of film noir, as he exchanges his femme fatale for a man that seeks womanhood through modern technology.  This displays Almodvar's ingenious way of telling a captivating story, as it does not follow the conventional rules that often make films one of dozens.

As mentioned previously, the film does not concentrate on the Catholic Church, but instead the aftermath of Ignacio's education.  Through several turns the film illustrates what happen to Ignacio.  Much of this goes back to his years when the head priest sought him out for his own pleasure, which continues to trouble Ignacio well into adulthood.  This seems to be the reason why Ignacio wrote the script in the first place, as he tried to exorcise his demons while trying to find an existence that fits with his upbringing and education.  The story drifts between Enrique reading the script to the present time with occasional flashbacks that provide additional information in regards to the story.  Initially, it might seem a little confusing, however, Almodvar has been nice enough to add a couple of side bars whenever there is a flashback or a scene from the script that Enrique reads.  Eventually, the audience will have gone through a very troubling, yet spellbinding tale that makes All About Eve (1950) seem like a Cinderella story.",1115337600,3,3891,4.943164362519202

However, the movie is darker than previous Almodovar works, because of the nature of the plot: church, sex and homosexuality.

2223972,3,B0007OCG5G,"Let me begin to say that while I rarely like Almodovar's films, I always look forward to seeing them as at least he has something to say. Unfortunately, even those films of his I do like (""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" ""Talk to Her"") I find unexciting. One can't help but notice the way his films have grown in leaps and bounds in the cinematography department. Where his films used to look like old sit-coms they now have a very artistic approach and feel to them. This film created a problem for me. I totally agreed with the point that he was making but disagreed with the way he went about it. For example, I totally agree with the assessment that the Catholic Church is a source of great evil and hypocrisy, especially when it comes to homosexuals. However, in this film it appears as though Almodovar believes that the Catholic Church is evil simply for the sake of being evil. In making a great villain the audience should be able to understand why the character is partaking in evil. Then we also have characters whom are gay and drug abusers, and they are portrayed as sympathetic characters. If his point on those characters is that we are all prisoners of our desires, then why doesn't that hold true on the priest? I would rather see the priest deal with his desires, as opposed to simply inflicting pain on others.  So to me this movie seemed to be talking out of both sides of it's mouth.  In my opinion, Almodovar has always been successful in probing emotional depths, but less successful at portraying them dramatically.  This film also has that problem. However, there was a lot good about this movie.  His nods towards film noir are all graceful (it's no coincidence that a ""Double Idemnity"" poster shows up near the end). Bernal turns in another great performance, and the scope of this film is nothing if not ambitious. That said, I have to give this movie a mild no vote, though you won't be wasting your time if you watch it. ***",1114560000,2,1965,4.526760563380281
2223973,4,B0007OCG5G,".......you won't be finding much of it in this film.  Not considering love among family and love between friends, the ONLY instance of love you will see here is that which shines in the eyes of two young, grade school boys as they look at each other while being torn apart for what appears to be forever.  Just one other possibility is a ""memory of love,"" which you see once or twice in the eyes of film maker, Enrique, as he is reminded of earlier, cherished times with his school companion.  Any other ""coming together"" of two people in this movie is for nothing more than lust.....or fixation/infatuation.....or sex, and, thankfully or no, this film provides all four.  But because there is nothing else, main character performances, while impressive, are cold and detached, offering us no hope for any positive future.  If this is part of what other reviewers ascribe to a works being of film noir genre, then, indeed, this work belongs in that category.  (Unrealistically, though, this reviewer would much prefer for a director's providing a future of coupling together in joy and happiness.)

Very good spoken ""walk-through"" of the film by the director as part of the Special Features.

PS:  For all those previous reviewers who've stated/indicated that Gael Garcia Bernal appears as Ignacio Rodriguez, you are wrong; he never does so.  Bernal appears only as Zahara (female impersonator), as Ignacio's younger brother, Juan, who is an actor calling himself Angel, and, again, as Juan in an earlier stage of his life (with shorter hair), prior to his taking up acting.  Bernal plays two characters, not three.

PPS:  One parting thought:  If this film is in any way a reflection of Almodovar's own life, then it has been not a particularly happy one.  But, well, that is a subject for althogether completely different consideration.",1114473600,2,1838,4.941368078175896
2223974,5,B0007OCG5G,"I have never been a fan of Almodovar's movies but this one is an exception. I loved this movie from start to finish and is very easy to understand why: GAEL GARCIA BERNAL. He delivers an amazing, tour-de-force performance playing three completely different characters. Not only does Bernal steals every scene from the rest of the actors in the film he is virtually in almost every single scene either as Ignacio, Angel or Zahara a drag queen who impersonates the legendary Sara Montiel to perfection. Bernal looks stunning in drag and for a minute you forget that he is a man made up and fully dressed as a woman.

The film is very well written and expertly directed by Almodovar. The rest of the cast does a fantastic job especially Daniel Gimenez Cacho who plays the priest who sexually molested Ignacio at an all boys Catholic school. Fele Martinez who plays Enrique Goded an up and coming filmmaker who was Ignacio's best friend at the school also does an incredible job. This movie is not for everyone but you should check it out and see it because it is truly a master achievement in Spanish filmmaking. There is some nudity in the movie but very little. There is a sex scene between the two of them where Bernal is on his stomach and Martinez is doing him from behind but the scene lasts a few seconds. Yet I feel it was important to demonstrate the sexual attraction that the characters had for each other especially Martinez for Bernal.

Try and see this film with an open mind and leave your inhibitions behind and you will enjoy this landmark film to its fullest. The acting is excellent and the story is very well thought out. Gael Garcia Bernal fans this one is a MUST SEE and even if you haven't yet discover the amazing talent that this young actor brings to every role that he plays this is a great movie to find out why everyone can't get enough of this young man. One of the finest actors of his generation. Gael is in the same league as Johnny Depp and Ethan Hawke. He also reminds me of what Marlon Brando must have been like at his age. Bad Education or La Mala Educacion (in Spanish) is a masterwork that will leave you thinking and wanting more.",1114300800,3,2168,4.472222222222222
2223975,5,B0007OCG5G,"""Bad Education"" is writer/director Pedro Almodovar's remarkably creative comment on sexual abuse among Roman Catholic clergy, but it is far from being straightforward or confined to one theme. The film weaves a complex tale of exploitation, deceit, ambition, seduction, and blackmail that places a story within a story and shifts back and forth in  time. Sixteen years after they attended school together, Ignacio Rodriguez (Gael Garcia Bernal) visits Enrique Goded (Fele Martinez), who was his closest friend when they were 10 years old. Enrique is now a famous film director in the midst of a minor creative crisis. Ignacio is an ambitious actor looking for a job, and he has brought a short story he wrote based on their childhood experiences for Enrique's consideration. The story, entitled ""The Visit"", tells of a female impersonator named Zahara who by chance meets his old schoolmate Enrique, whom he loved as a boy. Zahara is eager to see Enrique again, but after he has carried out an important errand: Zahara goes to the chapel at his old school to blackmail a priest, Father Manolo (Daniel Gimenez Cacho), who abused him as a boy. Enrique the director thinks the story would make a splendid film, but he soon discovers that nothing is quite as it seems.

With Gael Garcia Bernal playing both a ""real"" character and a fictional character that is a representation of a real character who is played by someone else; a chain of blackmail that begins in reality, continues in fiction, and then invades reality again; a fictional murder that mirrors a real one; and everything that goes around seems to come around, ""Bad Education"" risks being too clever for its own good at times. All of these twists and ironies are orchestrated to create structural and thematic symmetry, but they are interesting and convincing. The film's vibrant purples, oranges, reds, and teals look fantastic. Almodovar has a rare ability to make bright colors leap off the screen without being at all overbearing.

""Bad Education"" gets reflexive when the characters attend a film noir marathon and declare, ""It's as if all the films were talking about us."" The word ""noir"" pops up conspicuously in another scene as well. I don't know how that was intended, but it's probably a good thing that the reference comes across as funny rather than self-conscious. That's not to deny the film's ""noirness"". Gael Garcia Bernal is an inspired homme fatal. And ""Bad Education"" is unlike other Almodovar films in that none of the characters are empathetic, except perhaps the children.

With their requisite sex, drugs, and transsexuals, Pedro Almodovar's films aren't to everyone's taste. But, for Almodovar fans, ""Bad Education"" is a winner. It's a pleasure to watch this twisted tale unfold. In Spanish with English subtitles.

The DVD (Columbia Tristar 2005 release): Bonus features include 2 featurettes, 2 deleted scenes, a ""Photo Gallery"" of poster art, and an audio commentary by writer/director Pedro Almodovar. ""Red Carpet Footage from the AFI Film Festival"" (18 minutes) includes some interviews intercut with film clips as well as Almodovar's introductory speech at AFI Fest. ""Making of Bad Education"" is just 2 minutes of unnarrated behind-the-scenes footage. The audio commentary by Pedro Almodovar is quite detailed and interesting. Almodovar provides scene-by-scene and occasionally shot-by-shot analysis of characters, story, structure, themes, and many other details.

2223976,5,B0007OCG5G,"After building a career and international notoriety as the ""infant terrible"" of the Spanish cinema with his irreverent and Felliniesque debauchery, Almodovar (whom I've loved from the word go) delivers what is, in my opinion, his most complete and accomplished film.  His narrative style here is inspired while his trademark visuals remain very much in tact, however, as in the past we were seduced by the bold, fantastic and unapologetic machinations of a gifted upstart, here you feel that you are in the presence of genuine cinematic genius; brilliant, focused and wholly original.  The disparate musings of earlier films here are fleshed out and woven expertly.  Everyone is uniformly excellent and those that, like me, have witnessed his evolution will not be surprised to find that a very gifted filmmaker has emerged.  Yes, the extreme edginess and raw quality of earlier films are not to be found here, but don't be fooled, this is still not a film for the faint of heart.  His penchant for the underbelly and/or fringe society is still present (whereas ""Talk to Her"" took on a more conservative cast of characters), ""La Mala Educacion"" is more in keeping with earlier efforts such as ""Law of Desire,"" ""Matador"" and ""High Heels.""

That is the basis of this film within a film within a film ...

2223983,5,B0007OCG5G,"With All About My Mother and Talk To Her, Pedro Almodovar explored themes of love, loss and redemption. Almodovar continues to explore these themes in Bad Education, his first full-fledged gay themed film since Law of Desire. Bad Education is a loosely remade adaptation of Law of Desire. It uses similar characters and situations but tells a completely different story.  Unfolding like an elaborate Hitchcock thriller, we're thrust into a world of lies, deception, blackmail, mistaken identities and murder.  At the core of this film is a gay love story between two schoolmates, Enrique and Ignacio that is thwarted by jealous pedophile priest, Father Manolo but there are so many layers to Bad Education, stories within stories, that at times it's a swirling eddy of suspenseful tension that unfolds like a piece of origami. Another theme in Almodovar's last two films that is also explored in Bad Education is exposing the human aspects of despicable characters causing the viewer to sympathize in spite of everything.  How can you not feel sorry for Father Manolo as he tearfully says goodbye to Juan in the pouring rain?  Yes, he's a despicable character but he's also human, and that's what Almodovar shows us,  the human element that drives people to do what they do.  There is so much going on in Bad Education that I highly recommend a second viewing to absorb all of the nuances of yet another brilliant Almodovar film.  Highly recommended but not for the homophobic.",1108339200,6,1477,4.979674796747967
2223984,4,B0007OCG5G,"I can take or leave most early Almod&oacute;var films, Atame, Qu&eacute; he hecho yo..., Mujeres al borde..., etc. but since Carne Tr&eacute;mula (Live Flesh, 1997), I've enjoyed every one. His films during the eighties and early nineties were energetic diatribes rallying against Franco's repression, filling the screen with gaudy images of debauchery and violence designed to keep el Generalisimo revolving in his ornate tomb. In his most recent films the traditional leitmotifs of repression, sexuality, violence and revenge continue, but the desire to offend with graphic, almost cartoon, imagery has given way to a new-found subtlety in how societal taboos are confronted. And sometimes this subtlety can be even more powerful.

In Bad Education Almod&oacute;var tackles paedophile priests and the tragic effects on one boy in particular. It's hard to describe the non-linear plot which has you trying to work out exactly what's real, what's fiction, and who's who, without giving too much away. Half the fun of the film is piecing the parts together. But it's gratifying to know that by the final scene it all gels together perfectly.

Gael Garcia Bernal is the centerpiece here and he turns in astounding performances playing several characters including Sara Montiel impersonator, Zahara, and abuse survivor Ignacio (or is he?...). He's involved in pretty much every homoerotic scene in the film, which may or may not be a selling point. I don't think I could watch the Motorcycle Diaries in the same way again, having now seen Che Guevara in drag fellating a passed-out drunk in a motel.

Although abuse at the hands of the Catholic Church's finest isn't new cinematic territory, Almod&oacute;var's direction and ability to evince career-making performances from his cast lifts this high above the norm. All non-homophobic lovers of dark tales of obsession, revenge and mystery will enjoy this film.",1107561600,7,1908,5.311258278145695
2223985,5,B0007OCG5G,"Pedro Almodovar persuades us once more his never ending creative powers with this powerful and brutal story which links and determines so many destinies sealed by the hypocrisy, the rotten ethics and the abominable instincts behind the power's helmet.

But the film is besides a real master class about edition process. A magnificent script solidly with three levels of narration. The plot demands from you an absolute attention. The light effects are by themselves another tour de force component. You may realize the presence of certain illumination who reminds us to Caravaggio to emphasize for instance the morbidity, the nasty blame, the loss of the self esteem, the sad farewell to the dreams of youth and the unavoidable decadent pedophile pestilence.

In the other hand the rhythmic pulse never lets you. The overlapping and intersected dramatic lines amazes us due their astonishing fluidity and natural cohesion. There is not a simple shot out of context. This surprising and tragic puzzle breathes as real tide: a synchronized concatenation of sequences will lead us from the facts to the feelings and never vice versa.

This brilliant director has left behind himself all the frivolities and bitter ironies which characterized his first stage. He has known to descend to Dante's hell through the description of sordid and unthinkable situations, reminding us once more that ancient statement: The reality overpasses the fiction.

2223986,5,B0007OCG5G,"Prior to Bad Eduacation, I have seen Almodovar's All About My Mother and Talk To Her. The latter two films have profound ability to be emotionally empacting and visually beautiful, packed with great performances. In his latest film, he intentionally abandoned the previous horizons, and chartered onto homo-erotica, sexual trauma, revenge, and redemption. It's certainly more provocative and challenging for any viewers who don't watch this kind of themes and are not die-hard Almodovar or Javiar Camara fans. By the way, the old man who sat next to me walked out in less than 15 minutes when he saw Zaraha performing on stage. Obviously, he's never been fond of Almodovar's works or would never watch a gay movie.

I must say that it's very intricate story to follow at first, just trying to figure out the characters and trying to observe the actors while reading the subtitles. It starts with Gael Garcia Bernal(Juan, but prefers to be called Angel(his stage name), an ambitious actor with a story(The Visit) that he wanted to be made into a film. He took it to Enrique Goded( Fele Martinez), a film maker whose brother had been friends with when they were kids in a catholic school. From there onward, the mystery of The Visit unfolds as it was based on real life experiences that was rather traumatic and compelling.

In The Visit, Inagcio(Juan's older brother) and Enrigue were good friends who had feelings for each other, and gradually got sexually involved depite the fact that Enrigue thought it was a sin. Meanwhile, Inagcio is under the burden of sexual harrassment from Father Manolo( Daniel Gimenez Cacho), which had ultimately traumatized him for life. Later, his character becomes a transexual and a drug addict, and planned to blackmail the former priest who had gotten married and changed his identity to Sir. Manuel Berenguer(Lluis Homar), who eventually seduced the young and sexy Juan. Homar and Juan's affair propelled them to murder Ignacio, and after that Juan just abandoned the scene to pursued his acting career.

Enrique had a crush on Angel and wanted to sleep with him, but he didn't know that The Visit is not entirely based on the truth. Soon  Angel convinced him to cast him to play Zaharah, which is really the character of his dead brother/sister. He was willing to get lessons from another drag queen as part of preparing for the lead role in the film. By the time they shot the murder scene, he was so overwhemlmed, because he was remorseful deep down inside. Then Sir. Manual Berenguer showed up to tell Enrique the truth about The Visit......

Javiar Camara, who was the lead in Talk To Her, has  merely a camero in this film, and he play Paca/Paquito, a flamboyant ""girl"" friend of Zahara.

Fele Martinez is a total Sam Rockwell look-alike! Well, he's better looking and sexier, and he gets to have a steammy love scene with Bernal. His performance is quite captivating.

Daniel Gimenez Cacho, the sinner  does intense deeds and his performance is mesmerizing when he's torn between lust and guilt.

Lluis Homar is Bob Hope look-alike, and he gives a fine performance as a man trying to let go and move beyond his sins. He also has a steamy sex scene with Bernal!

Gael Garcia Bernal has the juiciest role to play. He's the focal point in this film, and he's gorgeous wether he was swimming and revealing most of his goods, or all dolled up and looking like the ""Pretty Woman"". It's a very complex performance that he delivered.

Overall, this film still features Almodovar's signiture good visuals(vibrant colours and beautiful camera work), and impeccable score and soundtrack! It's a very edgy in a way, because the sex scenes are rather ""soft-core"" pornographic. It might turn off the ""pedestrain"" audiences easily.",1105920000,3,3759,4.883830455259027

This was such an important film for Almodovar that he named his company ""El Deseo S.A."" and as I see this it's no wonder why this movie of all his movies is out of print and not available for purchase.

2223989,3,B0007OCG5G,"Pedro Almodvar's individualistic filmmaking style is on full display here, but oddly, the heart that propelled the wonderful ""Talk to Her"" seems to be missing. What results is a rather disappointing addition to the otherwise humanistic Almodvar canon, a classic case of style over substance. The convoluted plot begins in the present with an apparent flashback about an episode in the past, then presents that story as a film within the film, and finally the two parallel stories become a hybrid that seems to pay tribute to forties Hollywood film noir.

The focal character is Enrique, a young and successful director who is searching for inspiration for his next production. He receives a visit from an old school friend, Ignacio, who provides it with a short story he brings with him called ""The Visit"". Based on their childhood, it involves Ignacio being sexually abused by a priest at the school they attended together. Indeed, he permitted the abuse in order to get Enrique out of some trouble. Lurid melodrama, as only Almodvar can serve up, ensues, and an imagined reunion occurs between the abusive priest and the two childhood friends and first-loves. Spinning off Enrique's film-set, the director deftly switches narrative voices to make the abuser the victim, and the moral ambiguity of the central characters becomes heightened. Despite the audacious creativity behind the change in perspective and some strong acting, the problem with this approach is that one ends up not feeling much sympathy for any character in the film.

In a dramatic turnabout from his comparatively stoic Che Guevara in ""The Motorcycle Diaries"", Gael Garcia Bernal effectively goes for the audacious in playing Juan/Angel, the homme fatal and struggling, petulant actor, as well as the blonde, sultry Zahara, a transvestite and cabaret singer. But even his efforts are not enough to offset the endless layering of the stories and imagined histories that continue to redirect the story ad nauseum. It's too bad since the basic story feels like Almodvar's most autobiographical film, moving as it does from a Catholic school in 1960s Spain to liberated 1980s Madrid, a period and setting with which the director is personally intimate. He also seems to be making a statement about recent scandals in the Catholic Church where they have willingly turned a blind eye to crimes of abuse against helpless children. But ultimately the movie is about his love of depicting erotic role-playing more than anything else and how reality and fiction merge. You will see traces of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and ""Marnie"" and Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" in the labyrinthine of identities taken on by the characters. But the film falls short of these classics as Almodvar takes on more than he is willing to commit emotionally to the film leaving the viewer with a rather cold feeling at the end. Granted it has all of the director's omnipresent visual flair, including the striking opening titles and the Bernard Herrmann-like music (courtesy of Alberto Iglesias), this is a disappointment considering the talent involved.",1104969600,5,3097,5.1673306772908365
2223990,5,B0007OCG5G,"This is an excellent, interesting and twist laden film. I had never seen any of Almodovar's pictures, but understand now why he is so revered and successful.

Bad Education is a wonderfully textured, graphic and layered film, truly a brightly colored noir for the new century. I appreciated how the film required an attention to story, to the editing, and the juxtaposition of characters, some super-imposed on top of each other.

Highly recommended. This is a heavily homosexual film, one that may make people uncomfortable with homosexuality even more uncomfortable. Such is the nature though of the characters, who are as complex as the story, while being fully recognizable to me.",1104969600,,684,5.153153153153153
2223991,5,B0007OCG5G,"Gael Garcia Bernal, playing Juan/Angel/Zahara is the centerpiece, the place in which the heart of this film resides, for it is his broken damaged heart that sets the tone and the focus of  Almodovar's ""Bad Education""

And at the core of Bernal's tour-de-force performance is his shredded psyche: broken apart by years spent plotting revenge for the drug addiction and childhood abuse of his brother, Ignacio. Juan is one of the ""damaged people"" of whom Tennessee Williams so often writes. And Almodovar has chosen to make Juan not only a hero but also a heroine, the femme fatale, Zahara.

Almodovar, never one to be squeamish or afraid of censure, is out for blood in ""Bad Education"" as he slices open and excises the sexual mores in Franco-era Catholicism in which child abuse was accepted as the norm. (Unfortunately, nothing seems to have changed much)

Moviemaker Enrique Goded (Fele Martinez) gets a visit one day from a man claiming to be Enrique's friend from school, Juan (Bernal) even though Enrique doesn't seem to recognize him as his Catholic school friend. Juan is very insistent that Enrique read a story he has brought with him. And it is this story that sets off a series of scenes into painful and disturbing memories about school, about love between boys, about hypocrisy among adults, about corruption in matters of the heart.

Almodovar has a very keen eye for the American movies of the 1950's and ""Bad Education"" is drenched with the dark, foreboding, and passionate colors of a Douglas Sirk film. But this is a film which acknowledges the past but whose mindset is of the Now.

Almodovar has made a thriller, a detective story but has done so with the heart of a romantic and he has used Enrique as his detective to try to solve the mystery that is Juan/Angel/Zahara. That Enrique finds out more than he bargained for is a given in an Almodovar film. That he unlocks a Pandora's Box of secrets, recriminations and corruptions and then quickly closes the lid to seal them up again signifies a filmmaker who is practicing the fine Art of showing rather than telling and explaining.",1103846400,81,2103,4.795580110497237
2223992,5,B0007OCG5G,"LA MALA EDUCACION is a splendid work of art.  Pedro Almodovar has been making some of the most creative films from any country for the past decade or so, but now with the arrival of 'La mala educacion' on the heels of his powerfully successful films 'Habla con ella' and 'Y tu mama tambien', few can fail to realize that he is a director that fuses the magic of  Fellini, Bunuel, Hitchcock, Resnais, and the other film creators who have stamped the cinematic arena as pure art.

Not only is this film a visual delight - scenic compositions with colors and light vs shadow effects and perceptual vantages - it is also told with a script so finely written that it simultaneously becomes poetry, acerbic social comment, storytelling that is languidly beautiful at one moment and intellectually challenging at another.  Almodovar's imagination is fed by autobiographical information, his own strong views on human sexuality, the Catholic Church, and the madness that lies just beneath the transparent skin of us all.

The plot is both simple and convoluted: Ignacio  and Enrique (Nacho Perez and Raul Garcia Forneiro) are two young boys in Catholic School who are in love. Ignacio is also the passion of Father Manolo (David Gimenez Cacho) who out of jealousy expels Enrique to have Ignacio to himself as a sexual partner.  Flash forward and Enrique (now Fele Martinez) is a blocked film Director searching for a script when Angel (Gael Garcia Bernal) enters his life with a script (written by Ignacio whom he claims to be, but who is really Juan (aka Angel) the straight younger brother of  Ignacio (Francisco Boira) a drag queen who is attempting to blackmail Father Manolo who is now called Sr Berenguer (Lluis Homar).  Enrique is suspicious of Angel's true identity, accepts his script to read, then investigates the truth about his former lover Ignacio based on the information in the vivid script.  The actor 'Angel' wants the part of Zahara (a drag queen who we have been seeing as yet another guise of Gael Garcia Bernal) in his script and will stop at nothing to achieve that. Yes, there is much more story - but enough of the intrigue:  how this bizarre set of characters intertwine and the real story of the past and the present unravel is the glory of this immensely complex, challenging and vividly entertaining script. One is never sure whether the tale before our eyes is life as it is happening, memory, or an on going filming of a movie!

As always, Almodovar has gathered a cadre of actors from earlier films and adds new flesh to expand his 'company' of committed collaborators.  Included in the cast are such favorites as Javier Camara (the primary force of 'Habla con ella') and Juan Fernandez.  Each difficult role is played to perfection.  But it is the absolutely bravura performances of Gael Garcia Bernal that will astound you.  He moves with complete ease and credibility through the 'straight' Juan, Angel, and Zahara: his drag queen portrayal is so wholly convincing that one would swear he inhabited the body and psyche of a woman.  Almodovar's camera loves Garcia  and here celebrates an actor of such importance at such a young age that the future of Bernal is more than secure. This young actor is simply magnificent.

And the cinematography is first rate as is the musical score by Alberto Iglesias.  Every aspect of this film, beginning with the clever, colorful and story-additive titles, breathes genius.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, December 2004",1102723200,7,3485,4.881154499151104
2223993,5,B0007OCG5G,"Like any Pedro Almod&oacute;var film, Bad Education is visually beautiful (almost lyrical), colorful (in characters and visuals), dense (borderline ""huh?""), and funny with an array of complex characters with enough tragedy for the entire population of any Red State of your choosing! It's a story about revenge and lust and how they can (and will) destroy one's dreams and life.

Gael Garcia Bernal is incredible playing three characters to mere perfection. One of the characters is Zahara--a drag queen. Make that a faaaaabulous drag queen! In drag, Gael eerily looks like Julia Roberts/Juliet Lewis it's not even funny! Seriously, it freaked me out!

Daniel Giminez Cacho excels as the creepy pedophile priest. I can never see Giminez Cacho in another film without thinking of him as Padre Manolo. The stories within stories can be confusing, except that Almodovar toggles between 1 and 1.85 aspect ratio to keep the ""real"" story and the film story separate. As Almodovar says in the stunning commentary on the DVD, the point of view is really the character of Enrique Goded, played with detachment and cruelty by Fele Martinez.",1522972800,,642,4.89908256880734

8049510,5,B0007OCG5G,"What can really be said of ""Mala Educacion""?  This was not one of Almodovar's weakest scripts, unless emotion is a weakness.  Moral ambiguity surrounds the story - is, in fact, the essence of the story.  Created at a time when the Church was revealed as a poison (before Francis sent child molestation to committee), the film assaults the viewer and the senses.  It is, in every way, a spectacular degradation of the human soul.  The plot twists are epic in their grandeur.  Almodovar may not be the world's best director but he really has a way with characters - they are always fascinating and his imagination leads them to every point on the emotional compass.  This is a story within a story, literally, and only by watching closely will you know the real Ignacio.  The plot unfolds unpredictably, almost organically, and it sucks you in (so to speak).  The acting, particularly on the part of Bernal, is exquisite.  The direction is indulgent but not to a fault - you see just what is intended.  I've seen many an Almodovar film but this is the only one where I see Almodovar bitterly angry.  If, in some way, the movie falls short of excellence, it seems it would be only because the director wanted the full impact of clerical abuse, physical and mental, to be known in all its forms.  Unquestionably, this is one of Almodovar's greatest films, an ambitious project borne out of personal pain and the fruits of the confessional.",1499904000,,1435,4.692
