208767,3,6300147274,"Oh, Vice Squad. A starring vehicle for our favorite girl in Chock Full O' Nuts, Season Hubley. What can i say? I haven't seen this in a while, so that was the biggest treat. Watching the trailer brought back memories of seeing the commercial over and over on tv. This film was the tail end of '70's exploitation holdouts, and delivers in so many ways as far as tactless brutality you just don't see anymore. Wings Hauser is of course fantastic as ""Ramrod"" (the killer pimp), and Gary Swanson has plenty of great lines as the cop possesed w/ bringing him down. The name says it all, so i won't waste time w/ a plot synopsis. What i will cover is what surely others will, and that's Anchor Bay's treatment. The movie looks and sounds fine, and thats probably all we really need. I'm content to have a dvd copy. (Do we need a HD transfer of this?) But Anchor Bay is spreading out and paying much more attention to it's other areas, and the days of 3 - disc Suspirias' may be gone. There is grainy film in several scenes, and the extras do not exist.(Trailer only) AB has gave us so much, so i can be forgiving, and Blue Underground has been spectacular, so....",1140134400,6,1157,4.361111111111111

208769,3,6300147274,"First of all, Vice Squad was NOT made in 1990. Where Amazon came up with this date is beyond me. The film was released in 1982.
The focus of the film is ""Princess"" (Season Hubley - the one time Mrs. Kurt Russell) a pretty, if not anorexically thin, hooker who happens to have a kid she is trying to raise.

The setting is a single night in Hollywood, CA.'s seamy underside. The Vice Squad is trying to find the pimp who killed a young hooker named Ginger by beating her to deah with a ""pimp stick"" (this is something I did not know about - it is apparently a wire coat hanger bent up in such a way that can inflict major damage).
The cops stumble across Princess, an otherwise suburban mom who packs her kid off to her monther's in Barstow every so often so that she can turn enough tricks to pay the bills. (In other words she's one of Hollywood's favorite stereotypes: the kindly hooker).
The Vice Squad asks for Princess' help in arresting Ginger's psycho pimp: Ramrod. Now, Wings Hauser plays Ramrod. And let me tell you, this is one sick and demented SOB. He gets off on inflicting pain and humiliation on others.
The cops get him and...film over right?
Wrong. Ramrod gets away from the cops and he's out for revenge on Princess.
Essentially this is a chase film, but it isn't your standard chase film. Along the way you learn some of ""hooker terminology"" and you are introduced to some of the more bizarre clientele of those ladies of the night: a guy who wants Princess to dress in a slutty wedding dress while the Wedding March plays, then as she enters the room where he is: a mortuary, in a coffin, the music turns to the death march...
This is a good film noir. Somehow I've always gotten the feeling that this film was intended for television, but the subject matter would have never passed muster, so they beefed it up and released it (very limited) into the theatres.

I don't know. But I do know that you could do far worse for your buck. Check it out.",1118016000,16,1967,4.371584699453552

208771,5,6300147274,"I saw this movie dozens of times in the 80s. It was always a HUGE favorite of mine. I started looking for it again in the 90s but it was increasingly hard to come by. After finding it again, all I can say is one word: RAMROD!! As sick, violent and twisted as he is, you can't help but be mesmerized by his presence. He always has your complete attention when he's on. Wings Hauser portrays Ramrod as an insanely violent, white pimp who works the seedy Hollywood area. His temper is always out of control. Add Ramrod to the scummy Hollywood streets, prostitutes and pimps, and you have a movie which will definately give you the escape you need from tedious, boring everyday life. There are some pretty sick, violent parts just as a warning, but if you want an escape, as I said, from the drab, dull ""life is wonderful"" B.S.  sitcoms and horrendously awful reality shows that are crammed down our throats on TV today, this will take you away from nice , quiet, wonderful suburban sitcoms into the slimy world of Hollywood's sex-for-sale world.

Pepe Serna (SCARFACE) and original MTV VJ Nina Blackwood co-star in this vicious `80s action smash from the creator of the `schoolgirl hooker' hit ANGEL and the director of DEAD & BURIED.

This intense action/drama flick also takes me back to memory lane to when Ronald Reagan was president & we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when this movie was theatrically released in the Winter of 1982 around the same time THE SEDUCTION with Morgan Fairchild & Andrew Stevens was released.",1389052800,,1232,4.857142857142857

The bad guys are planning a bank heist, but they won't let the police get in their way! Needless to say, Robinson is the man for the job. He's one step ahead of the crooks, the lawyers and the rest! It's easy to see how this film inspired a carload of TV shows in the same vein. It's excellent and you will not be disappointed.

Note: The DVD product is not being reviewed, simply the film. The Vice Squad speaks not of DVD, therefore we will not be bothered by it. Look Out!!!

208788,3,6300147274,"It was 1953 when Edward G. Robinson, known for his gangster roles in ""Little Caesar"", ""Key Largo"" and star of hit films such as ""Double Indemnity"", ""The Stranger"" and ""The Ten Commandments"" would appear in a detective film known as ""Vice Squad"".

The film is a film adaptation of Leslie T. White's ""Harness Bull"" and was directed by Arnold Laven (""The Rifleman"", ""The Big Valley"", ""Geronimo"") and written by Lawrence Roman (""A Kiss Before Dying"", ""Under the Yum Yum Tree"".

Along with Robinson, the film would also feature actress Paulette Goddard, actress and Chaplin muse who starred in films such as ""Modern Times"", ""The Great Dictator"", ""Second Chorus"", ""Pot o' Gold"".

The police drama follows the day in the life of Capt. Barnaby (played by Edward G. Robinson) and is shot almost in a docudrama style.

The film begins with two thieves known as Barkis & Monty are trying to break into a car, meanwhile at a building nearby, a well-respected funeral director named Jack Hartrampf (played by Porter Hall) is having a fun time (and having an affair) with a woman named Vicki Webb (played by Joan Vohs).  As he tries to leave the area without anyone seeing him, he sees a police officer Kellogg trying to arrest one of the car thieves, while one of them is hiding. The hiding thief shoots the police officer and the thieves leave with the stolen car.

As Kellogg screams for help, Jack comes to his aid and other police officers show up and see him next to the officer and arrest him.

The film then shifts to a police precinct as Capt. Barnaby comes to the office hearing that one of his officers is in the hospital and fighting for his life and we see how operations are going on at the office.  Throughout the day, we see see Capt. Barnaby busy and giving orders to his detectives.

One detective is interrogating Jack Hartrampf who is not cooperating until his lawyer arrives (and keeping quiet because his wife will find out that he has been with prostitutes), meanwhile a thug has information for the Capt. and tells him that two thieves that were released from prison are now out and their plans are to rob a bank.  So, Barnaby has his detectives look into it.

We also see Barnaby trying to help one woman who's afraid that her mother is being swindled by a man, having to prepare for a televised news conference and also having to deal with the death of an officer, while maintaining his composure in front of the detectives.  But doing all that's possible to catch them.

It is possible that the two thieves that shot the officer, may be the same people who may be robbing the bank.  Fortunately, Capt. Barnaby has a source to get information from the underground, via escort agency owner named Mona Ross (played by Paulette Goddard), who he hopes will give him information on these two thieves and find out where they may be.

MOD PLAYABILITY:

Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's are the printing quality. There are some who can't get them to play and are literally now just coasters.

With ""Vice Squad"", its printed quite well with printing on top of the DVD, it's not a plain silver disc with letters. If you didn't know it was MOD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.

As for playability, I played it on my Blu-ray player and DVD player with no problems. I then played it on my Mac, no problems whatsoever.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

As far as picture quality goes, the film has been manufactured using the best source available. The picture quality for ""Vice Squad"" is actually very good.  Black levels are nice and deep, white and gray levels and overall contrast is very good, I didn't see damage or many white specks.  A good amount of grain.

As for audio, dialogue is clear and detected no pops or hissing during my viewing of ""Vice Squad"".

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Edward G. Robinson called his '50s films as mere B-films, but I have to say that ""Vice Squad"" was actually quite entertaining and required really good planning and pacing to keep the overall storyline fluid.

The film is a docudrama focusing on a normal day of Capt. Barnaby and because it shows him interacting with many people and it definitely required Barnaby to be in his top game as he would go from room to room and character to character and having to deal with different cases with different levels of emotion.

So, for me the many transitions was a positive, another positive was how many locations shots of Los Angeles during the early '50s.  There are a good number of shots at various locations that I have driven through and no longer look the way it does in this film.  And for film buffs who always hunt for locations, there are actual sign posts on what streets they are at (ie. Santa Monica Blvd.).  And also because of that era, it was interesting to see officers using shotguns instead of pistols.

And last, another major plus for me as a cinema fan is seeing one of the last few films that Paulette Goddard had shot in her career.  But it's also important to let viewers know that her role is quite short, despite her getting the top billing along with Robinson.  And speaking of talent, spaghetti western fans will probably be amused that actor Lee Van Cleef plays one of the thieves, Monty, who is one of the two thieves that is wanted in the film.

But for Edward G. Robinson fans, ""Vice Squad"" is one of the many B-films that he had starred in throughout the '50s, but this film is one of the better titles.

As for this made on demand DVD, fans of this film will be happy to know that the video is in great shape.  No problems with video or audio whatsoever.

While I'm not sure why the film is called ""Vice Squad"" (since the film is not about narcotics, illegal sales of alcohol, gambling, etc.), I was quite entertained by this '50s film.  Especially to see how far the LAPD would go in pursuing the killers (let's just say that these officers don't exactly play by the book).

Overall, if you enjoy '50s police films or shows like ""Dragnet"", definitely give ""Vice Squad"" a try!",1335571200,2,6073,4.545036764705882
208789,3,6300147274,"It's interesting to look at once popular stars who for whatever reason fell out
of popularity and are put into lesser work and at times out of character. Edward g robinson and paulette goodard stars from the 30's were out of sync by the early 50's and couldn't find work,or good work,and Paulette was soon out of movies for good an actress who for whatever reason was up for the big part but never received it, but she did made decent films over the years. Robinson very often in the 50's was given roles trying to recreate his persona and the feeling for the 30's warner films like hellon on frisco bay(1956) and illegal(1955) but these were films looking backward and the greater stars moved onto other work and more modern type films and better pay,but they are entertaining. Here he is playing against type as a captain of police,showing the ins and outs and means he uses to get by the day solving a policeman's murder,a bank holdup,
hostage case,a count accused of a crime nowhere in the city,...and really showing how he solves each of these issues and tries to run a station. 1950's look at the workings of a police station...low budgeter during a quiet time in Robinson's career.",1333411200,2,1188,4.6084905660377355
208790,5,6300147274,"If there was ever a screen villian that is downright nasty & scary, it is Ramrod, Wings Hauser took this villian & made him every woman's worst nightmare & every cop's worst obsession, this film is just as real today as it was then, because you know there are people like this on the mean streets of Hollywood Blvd, The whole films takes place in one night in L.A. where a prostitue named Princess (Season Hubley) is told by vice cop Walsh (Gary Swanson) that she is to set-up Ramrod who has just beaten to death another prostitute who was her & Walsh's friend & she reluctantly does so & the sting is a success, but Ramrod escapes custody & the race is on to find Princess before he does, although released in 1982, I have always felt that ""The Terminator"" (two years later) borrowed from this one just a bit, there are a few parallels somewhat, Ramrod bullies anyone & everyone in his quest to find Princess & exact his revenge which you know will be a lot worse than what he did to the other prostitute & Walsh's obsession with finding either one where his whole team search for her, this is one gritty film & it doesn't hold back, we meet some strange people along the way....mouthy prostitutes, Ramrod's supplier who likes leather & tattoos, a car mechanic Roscoe with a short temper, a old man who likes to pretend he is dead who has his chauffer hire Princess to partisipate in this whacked out fantasy, a mouthy pimp in a bar, a cross-dresser at the precinct, a mouthy junkie at the precinct, & just about every other crazy character out there on the streets of Hollywood Blvd, I don't think a film like this could get made today, it is not politically correct, & as one reviewer stated, it was one of the last expoitation films to be made, it is likely a film Quentin Taratino likes & was inspired by, I think it definately inspired James Cameron with ""The Terminator"" & is still a cult classic in its own right, there will never be another villian like Ramrod, bacause this character is all too real & that is what makes Wings Hauser's performance all too chilling to watch, he has sinced played good guys, but I think this role made Hollywood afraid of him to cast in other leading men roles, Highly Recommend this one for its gritty edge.",1328486400,,2250,4.43719806763285

208793,5,6300147274,"Vice Squad is, arguably, the 'citizen kane' of the big screen exploitation flicks. I remember seeing it at the now demolished Woods theatre in downtown Chicago when it was originally released, and later it was the very first vhs movie I ever rented. It more closely resembled those bada*** exploitationers from the 70's  many of which I am still collecting now on dvd. Squad has sex, violence, and sleaze-all the things your mother warned you that she didn't want you to see! Wings Hauser, fresh from his popular role on the tv soap Young and The Restless, was a revelation! He is undoubtably one of the ten best movie villans of all time and scary as hell! It's too bad they don't make big screen movies like this very much nowadays. Except for the occassional big screen entry from Tarentino or Rodriguez, most of the exploitation crap that they show on late night cable or straight-to-dvd is just that...crap-shot with very little imagination or enthusiasm. For quite a while I was afraid Vice Squad would never see a dvd release-so glad the ever resourceful Anchor Bay still knows what their base customers really like!",1298160000,,1123,4.788659793814433
208800,3,6300147274,"I'm something of an amateur devotee of low budget, grindhouse films. From flicks of the 60's to the present, I've seen my fair share. However, ""Vice Squad"" is one that will probably always standout to me, both in good ways and bad.

The basic plot is that a prostitute named ""Princess"" (played by Season Hubley) helps a seasoned vice cop (played by Gary Swanson) to take down a violent and deranged pimp named ""Ramrod"" (played by Wings Hauser), after he kills another prostitute friend of her's (played by Nina Blackwood), but soon becomes the target of the pimp's homicidal rage, after he escapes custody. Now the race is on between the vice squad and Ramrod, as to who will get to Princess first!

The film is certainly not for the faint of heart, or those who easily offend. No punches are pulled in the violence and degradation that is shown. It has a sort of gritty realism to it, but it doesn't quite make it over the hump to where you totally buy it. This is due to the stretching of credibility in some key moments. I mean, would an entire vice squad really go all out to find a single prostitute, even if her life were in danger? No, probably not. One cop, maybe two, but not the whole squad. And the violent pimp, who seems to constantly flip from calm to psychopathic at the drop of hat, would he really be able to intimidate all the hard players of this underbelly of civilized society? Again, probably not. So, when such instances happen, it takes you out of the moment and costs the film a lot of the dramatic tension it's trying to build.

Director Gary Sherman certainly does a nice job of portraying the seedier side of the big city (in this case Hollywood), as the grunge and sleaze of society's ""forgotten people"" is well displayed almost constantly. Sadly, though, there is little shown to us beneath that grimy surface. You never get into the minds of any of the players. You get a brief scene with Princess sending her daughter away, to show she has a softer side, but you never get much context on it. Even worse is Gary Swanson's play at the vice cop who gives a damn. Besides a very wooden performance, you never really get any insight into his reasons for being a vice cop. As he is asked at the film's end, ""Why do you do it, Walsh? The streets are never going to change."" The question is never answered, either to the character in the film or the audience.

The one solid bit here, is Wings Hauser's turn as the ultra-violent Ramrod. He plays it up for all he's worth here. He is certainly one of the perennial heavies of the 80's, both in film and television, but he steps things up a notch here, going from mean to downright brutal. His use of a coat hanger to whip up on prostitutes, shows a level of darkness that goes beyond ordinary misogyny. While most of the other actors just sort of plod along in their roles, Wings uses his to be a force of nature in the story, which is where most of the drama and action stems from.

The film is certainly not what one would call ""classic,"" either in the award-winning sense or otherwise, but despite it's many flaws, it still manages to hold your attention and stick with you long after you've watched it. Whether that is due to it having that special 80's vibe, that made many less-than-stellar films give you that sensation, or merely the fact you can't look away from the sometimes over-the-top slimy nature of it all, I can't say for sure. All I can say is that, for good or ill, this is one film you won't soon forget.",1280707200,,3498,4.408668730650155

208802,5,6300147274,"WOW, the adventures of Princess, Blue Chip, Ko Ko and all the rest are brought vibrantly to the screen in this DVD release of a campy and over-the-top look at a typical night on the Hollywood Vice Squad.  You know the story, Princess has a daughter who is sent away to San Diego with her rent-a-nanny while mommy turns tricks to pay for her stuffed animals.  In the mean time, a friend has been pimp-sticked to death and a Vice squad officer guilts Princess into wearing a wire to entrap the psycho pimp who killed her friend. He is captured, but then escapes and goes on a hunt to get even with the bitch who entrapped him.  So now the vice squad has to hunt two people instead of one, and it turns into a been there, done that day late dollar short series of misses until Ramrod and Princess meet up and she gets worked over good before Ramrod is crushed by the vice squad cops car just in the nick of time.

This movie is full of wonderful characters, Princess, Walsh, the Vice Squad cop who has a thing for her, Ko Ko the Korean hooker, Blue Chip who wears blue poker chip earings, also a hooker, a sugar pimp named Dorsey, leather guys like Fast Eddy with the mother of all tattoos, angry African-American bar patrons, a psycho garage owner named Roscoe, Mrs. Cruckshank, the owner of a motel on the strip who plays mah jong with Wong, a small ""ornamental"" whose diminutive stature belies a powerful martial arts background and an old rich guy who gets off on laying in a coffin while Princess in a wedding gown marches down the stairs to the mixed tuneage of the Wedding March and a funeral durge.

Great lines include:

""Blink motherf#*&er and you die in the dark"" and ""Not that one, the blue Ford, five-hundred don't get you no Eldorado"", and my favorite, ""My man will have a kilo of white stuff here before you can jump out of your leathers and spank yourself.""

Unfortunate for Freeman, ""Street Smart"" was a rather forgettable venture but Hauser was luckier.  Hauser's contribution is reason alone to see ""Vice Squad"" but the picture is so much more.  The film works on two levels.  Firstly, it's a cinema verite document of the vice scene in Hollywood.  Secondly, it's a dark comedy about the proclivities of the johns that frequent the strip.  A personal fave of mine is Season Hubley in Frederick's of Hollywood bridal wear to fulfill a rich john's fantasy.  The film is also beautifully photographed in all it's neon decadence.

208806,4,6300147274,"Vice Squad is a pretty cool movie.  This was back in the day when crime dramas were nice and gritty without any real message to get across.  Plotwise it's kept basic:  Season Hubley's a hooker.  An ""outlaw"" hooker coz she ain't got no pimp.  She's also an equal opportunity hooker catering to foot fetishists, golden shower enthusiasts and amputees.  She helps the cops nail a psychotic pimp named Ramrod(Great name. I have to laugh ever time this name is spoken in the film), he escapes custody, then the search is on for the vice suad to find either Hubley or Ramrod before Ramrod gets his revenge on the sneaky hooker.  That's all it really is.  Ramrod arms himself and searches the streets of Hollywood for Hubley.  Hubley continues to do her job, meeting an interesting bunch of ""johns"" along the way.  B movie regular Wings Hauser appears to be having the time of his life playing Ramrod, a character who should earn his place right next to Cape Fear's Max Cady or Blue Velvet's Frank Booth.  Hubley is a decent actress in this, but I certainly don't see what all the guys in this film are drooling over(then again I must consider the guys doing the drooling).  The film was directed by Gary Sherman who horror fans may remember as the director of Dead and Buried as well as Poltergeist 3.  A very fun piece of junkfood for around midnight on Saturday.  Leonard Maltin calls it ""dull and sleazy"", but he's only half right.  Plus, Maltin's a schmuck.  A priceless theme song sung by Hauser as well.",1145318400,2,1503,4.573033707865169
208807,4,6300147274,"According to the film Vice Squad (1982), the streets of Hollywood seem to be the place to be if you're a hustler, hooker, pimp, fiend, junkie, pusher, freak, weirdo, drag queen, deviant, reprobate, toe sucker, or just a degenerate miscreant in general...co-written and directed by Gary Sherman (Death Line, Dead & Buried, Poltergeist III), the film features Season Hubley (Escape from New York), Gary Swanson (The Bone Collector), and Wings Hauser (Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time, Tales from the Hood).  Also appearing is former MTV video disc jockey Nina Blackwood, Beverly Todd (They Call Me MISTER Tibbs!), Lydia Lei (Doctor Detroit), Fred `Rerun' Berry (""What's Happening!!""), and Hispanic character actor Pepe Serna (Red Dawn, Silverado), whom your may remember as Al Pacino's henchman who lost a few inches off the top via a chainsaw in the 1983 Brian De Palma film Scarface.

Season Hubley plays a single mother with a young daughter, relatively new to town, who makes ends meet as a prostitute named `Princess'.  As she's preparing to send her daughter away for the weekend so that she can hit the streets to ply her trade, she gets a frantic phone call from another streetwalker named `Ginger' (Blackwood), who's since gone into hiding after a vicious beating she received from her psychotic cowboy pimp named Ramrod (Hauser).  Princess, who's what's known as an `outlaw' (she works for herself), tries to give Ginger some advice, but it's pretty much a waste of time as Ginger's kind of stupid, possibly due to the fact Ramrod cracked her in the skull a few too many times (Ramrod eventually catches up to Ginger and whips her Mommie Dearest style with a `pimp stick', which is basically a bent out of shape clothes hanger).  A vice detective named Walsh (Swanson) makes the scene and vows to get Ramrod after seeing his overly sadistic handiwork.  To this end he enlists the aid of Princess (actually, he blackmails her) to lure Ramrod into a trap, which is successful, but a wily Ramrod manages to escape custody and is back on the streets...with a vengeance.  As you can imagine, old Ramrod is pretty P.O.ed about being set up (one might say he's seething cauldron of hostility, with serious anger management issues), so after equipping himself with a few, choice weapons (including a switchblade that looks more like a machete), he begins scouring the streets for Princess, who's unaware of his subsequent escape (and the beating she's surely in for once Captain Insano catches up to her).  Walsh and his colleagues are now desperately searching for either Princess or Ramrod before the nastiness goes down, sticking mainly with the latter as his trail of carnage is much easier to follow (Princess continues to work, taking on various clients including a rich weirdo and a sleazy conventioneer, among others).  The situation eventually comes to a head as the vindictive Ramrod catches up to Princess, and Walsh and his crew catch up to Ramrod, who isn't about to go down without a fight.

Vice Squad is a mean, grimy, sleazy, nasty and misogynistic film, seeped with a strong sense of realism driven by the composite characterizations and various location shots.  On the surface the main characters seem pretty standard (a hooker with a heart of gold, a sadistic pimp, an overworked veteran vice cop who's seen too much), but the lead actors manage to infuse enough in terms of personal touches to keep things interesting.  I originally saw this film a number of years ago on cable, and since then whenever I hear the name Wings Hauser, my mind immediately goes to the character he played here, mainly because his presence so fills the screen.  The one scene that really sticks with me is during the sting operation.  The cops bust in on his pad, attempt to subdue him, but he manages to grab Princess and use her as a shield with one arm, while beating her over the head with a barstool with the other arm.  Hauser didn't appear to be holding anything back, and I will admit sometimes it did seem a little comical, but more often than not it provided for some pretty tense stuff.  Swanson, on the other hand, felt reserved most of the time, which would seem in tune with the character as if I were a vice detective cruising Hollywood's mean streets, I probably wouldn't want to get to close to the ever present slime and moral decay for fear it might glom on...I thought Season Hubley also did very well as a woman who does what she feels she must for her and her daughter to survive, basically disconnecting herself from the harsh, nasty, seedy reality of her job if only to keep from taking her own life out of misery.  Keep an eye out for the late, great Fred `Rerun' Berry, as a hustler named `Super Pimp', in a short, but memorable scene in which Ramrod is shaking him down for information, right before he uses his giant switchblade to do something very unpleasant...let's just say Rerun won't be dancing for awhile.  As far as Ms. Blackwood, I didn't even recognize her in her role, given her character's used and seriously abused appearance. This is a very violent film, but the really brutal bits aren't shown as the scenes ends prior to the nastiness, usually picking up again during the aftermath, supplying the viewer enough visuals to draw their own mental images.  I thought director Gary Swanson did a wonderful job as the pacing rarely slowed down.  I especially liked the latter half of the film, as the story breaks off into three, separate threads, one following Princess, the second Ramrod, and the third Walsh and the police.  We're constantly switching between these three elements until they finally converge near the end, providing for a highly climatic and satisfying finish.

Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a good-looking anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) print on this DVD release.  There is a noticeable graininess in some scenes, but it didn't draw away from the images on the film.  Other than that, the print is very clear and sharp.  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through well, although some of the dialog was kind of muffled at times, making me wish there were English subtitles provided, but there aren't.  None of Anchor Bay Entertainment's past releases feature subtitles, which always seemed odd to me given their general commitment to quality overall.  As far as extras included, there's an audio commentary track with director Gary Swanson, a theatrical trailer for the film, two radio spots, a poster and still gallery, and a five page insert booklet with liner notes provided by Richard Harland Smith, a staff writer for Video Watchdog Magazine.

By the way, Hauser himself sang the theme song titled `Neon Slime', played at the beginning and end of the film.  Also, I learned cops get pretty upset when you steal their paper clips.",1141862400,19,6819,4.858498705780845
208808,5,6300147274,"Wow...I have not thought about this movie in over 20 years.  I recall seeing it first at a drive in when if first came out and later on TV.  This is really an outstanding movie that really doesn't star any major names.  Wings Hauser playing psychotic pimp and for the older MTV crowd, Nina Blackwood, one of the original VJ's plays a hooker named Ginger.  After murdering a hooker, the LA police are after Ramrod.  They use another hooker named Princess played by Season Hubley as bait to bring him down.  The plan goes awry when he escapes from the police and then begins to relentlessly track down Princess intent on killing her as well.

The scene is the gritty, seedy streets of nighttime Hollywood filled with prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, and every sort of degenerate and the film does a marvelous job of capturing this potent atmosphere.  Wings Hauser is absolutely mesmerizing and terrifying as Ramrod.  Almost like Jason from Friday the 13th except with a personality.  He's pure malice and sadistic to the core and he really makes the film.  In many ways Vice Squad was a bit ahead of its time as far as a gritty street thriller and is definitely worth a look.",1140652800,15,1174,4.6231884057971016

7803009,5,6300147274,"Vice Squad is among the better 1950's film noir movies because of the performances and, particularly, Hershel Burke Gilbert's dramatic music score.  Spaghetti western fans will recognize Lee Van Cleef (Angel Eyes, Colonel Douglas Mortimer), who was still playing ""second bad guy from the left"" roles in the 50's.

Burke's score alternates between a heroic police motif and a ""criminal"" theme that borders on outright vindictiveness--appropriate for the bank robbing gang that dominates the subplots.  The score later turned up in episodes of ""The Rifleman"", for which Gilbert wrote the theme and underscore.

This film's script and plot are refreshingly less predictable than most in this genre.  Worth owning for old film buffs!",1390003200,,729,5.415929203539823
