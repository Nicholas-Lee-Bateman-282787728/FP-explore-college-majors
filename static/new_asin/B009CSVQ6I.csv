5315398,5,B009CSVQ6I,"This documentary shows a great behind the scenes look at the NASHI youth movement in Russia that is not shown by the Russian ordained media. In many ways the NASHI youth movement is comparable to the Hitler youth movement in pre-WWII Germany, demonizing any who oppose the party line and intimidating them with beatings, prison and death for the simple crime of opposing their party line.

Though the documentary itself is average in quality, I believe people 20 years from now will look back at it in shock of how Russian youth followed the same disastrous path the youth of Germany followed in the 1930's.",1409356800,11,607,4.780952380952381

5315400,5,B009CSVQ6I,"Most of us have heard of the Hitler Youth movement and probably never thought that a major government would try to replicate such an organization in our lifetimes.  ""Putin's Kiss"" shows how very senior members of the Putin Government have built a youth organization that looks a lot too much like the Hitler Youth movement for my liking, complete with banners and stage managed political ""demonstrations"".  It also shows how such an organization can evolve in plain sight with seemingly innocent goals but be used to propagandize, to oppress and to punish any form of descent.  It is a scary movie that has significant implications for America today.",1383091200,8,650,5.0
5315401,4,B009CSVQ6I,"Every authoritarian government knows that the earlier you can indoctrinate the people the easier it is to keep them in line later (Hitler Youth, Mao, etc.).  This is Putin's personality cult to keep  Russia on his track to complete control.  Shows there is little they will not do to that end.",1464739200,,293,4.705882352941177
5315402,4,B009CSVQ6I,"Masha is depicted as a real person who starts her political stance in her youth, yet slowly grows out of it as she ages and experiences life realities in Russia. Nashia is almost cult-like, as are many political youth organizations in any country.",1463097600,3,247,4.767441860465116

5315406,4,B009CSVQ6I,"You have to be blind to not see, that or emotional damaged. The haunting quote is 'too old before your time.' or an old young man or woman as in the cynicism...It's not surprising, it's sad actually. This was put together fairly well, the information was good, the points of view were history on repeat, and Masha Drokova poor dear not sure how she is doing now...It was above all sad and disheartening to be sure...",1454198400,,416,4.4868421052631575

5315408,5,B009CSVQ6I,"This was a very interesting and informative look at the Pro-Putin Youth Organization that has basically become Putin's private army on the streets. I have seen some other documentaries about Nashi as well, and while it may not be quite as extreme as Hitler Youth, which it often gets compared to, it is basically a personality cult centered around Putin and funded with hundreds of millions of dollar of government money. So, a comparison of that type is inevitable. It's also interesting that in a country where things are often the opposite of what they seem, this groups claims to be anti-fascist, anti-oligarch, and pro-democratic. It looks like, at least to some extent, they do precisely the opposite of each of those things: Prevent democratic protests, protect Putin and his oligarch buddies, and mobilize hundreds of thousands of kids to march around with arm bands claiming to NOT be fascists. It may also seem superficial that the words ""Nashi"" and ""Nazi"" sound similar (""Nashi"" means ""ours"" in Russian). But, the bottom like is that both groups started out as extreme right wing nationalist parties and Nashi appears to be headed to a very dark place, just like previous movements of this type.",1450569600,4,1206,4.975247524752476

5315410,5,B009CSVQ6I,Very interesting...shows how very sincere people can be very sincerely misled..She shows great character in her rethinking what she believed in.,1446249600,,144,5.904761904761905
5315411,4,B009CSVQ6I,Eerily similar to the BDM and Hitler Youth movements during the times of the NAZIS...It gets slow at times but it is insightful how the youth are important tools for enslaving the people...,1445126400,,189,4.757575757575758

5315415,5,B009CSVQ6I,"A must view for those who wish not only to understand how Putin's Russia bamboozles its own people, but why the Russians are so easily brainwashed through the experience of a naive teenager, Masha Drokova an her experience with the ""Nashi"" (""Our's""). Frightening!",1433808000,,263,5.1395348837209305

5315419,5,B009CSVQ6I,"This was very eye-opening.  I am very disappointed that Putin is behind such a weak tactic to brainwash the youth in such a way they are akin to little Nazi youths.  I really hope these misguided youth open their eyes.  I understand they want to have justice, but their justice went from noble to dictatorial.",1424131200,,309,4.581818181818182
5315420,4,B009CSVQ6I,This is a good take on a very special area outside of Moscow and the propaganda machine used in Russia.,1412812800,2,103,4.2
8539659,5,B009CSVQ6I,"Very well done documentary, good information and it did an amazing job at being fair. The Putin Youth weren't demonized in the film, their views were presented. I'm sure they could have been presenting in a better light, but honestly, I'm not sure you can cast a positive light on a group of childish teenagers and adults who use ""dick and fart jokes"" to further there cause - along with openly and proudly trying to silence the voices of dissent. The comment was made that the speaker couldn't understand the Nashi fetish with the anus, and I think it's just demonstrates kids and then adults getting caught up in herd mentality. It's a natural thing, but very dangerous to a society in the long run, and the individual immediately. Only on Prime for another couple weeks, watch it whiles it's included. If you read this afterwards it's worth paying for as well. Someone commented about it feeling like reality TV. I would disagree, but I see what they mean. Reality TV has taken a lot from the traditional documentary style, as it makes it more ""real"" when presented that way. This more engaging then a traditional documentary, but in my opinion in no way reality TV.",1501977600,,1169,4.679611650485437
8539660,2,B009CSVQ6I,It sheds some light into Nashi political movement but the documentary felt like a reality TV show. How was it possible that the girl's progress and intimate dialogues of her struggles were filmed? It seems so staged... Also the anti Nashi journalists' burning of a politicial book reveals that they are behaving like Nashi members that they criticize... something is not right.,1497657600,,377,5.096774193548387
8539661,5,B009CSVQ6I,"We have a Nashi in the US too, it's called Antifa. It's very big on campus these days. The cause of much violence. The main stream media ignores it because Antifa hates President Trump too.",1491868800,2,189,4.428571428571429
8539662,5,B009CSVQ6I,Important film. Especially relevant in 2016.,1484265600,,44,6.5
8539663,5,B009CSVQ6I,"Great insight into how Putin's and the KGB propaganda machine starts at such a young age. Also great insight into the very dangerous work of private journalists who literally risk their lives daily to bring out the truth behind the machine. Their bravery and integrity is unwavering. For Americans, in this upcoming trump era, where a WA senator has already written a proposed legislation that would make peaceful protesting  ""economic terrorism"" and punishable by federal offense and prison time, coupled with Trumps unwavering hatred of any media who questions him, we need to take heed that things can spiral out of control extremely quickly if we don't as citizens pull together and make sure that our basic human rights are kept.",1484092800,3,734,5.066115702479339

8539666,4,B009CSVQ6I,"well, it is very insightful. I see and understand, mind control. very similar to how evangelicals manipulate youngins, and not to single out evangelicals per se, any group, who has a desire to turn minds to a 'way of thinking'. But, it also is very refreshing to peer into another country and culture and come away with a feeling that they are not all that very different.",1477180800,,372,4.567164179104478
8539667,5,B009CSVQ6I,Great documentary - it documents the fascination of millennials with Putin - something that also escaped the democratic party in the US where Bernie Sanders won the most popular vote in the history of US politics and left every political expert lost for words... There is a new world order that is shaping between the US and Russia so watch the documentary to understand the Pro-Putin Youth group with a grain of salt since we don't know who financed this movie... The strive for 'democracy' but the opposition in Russia fascinates me... if they only knew that there is no such thing as 'democracy' .. all they have to do is follow the US elections =),1477008000,4,651,4.620689655172414
