8327890,5,6304356609,"I tell you these video's were so great that I would go to Australia twice just to be able to ride all the trains I might miss on only one trip. But having only one life to live and only one trip to be able to afford, these  video's did the job for me.  To be able to track the area I will visit as  to which mode of travel I should take was accomplished by having these  great tools.  Australia is so vast that one needs to plan carefully to see  an area well. The train travel experience is well understood after watching  these lovely video's.  Once again having these video's in ones library is  like having a vacation in a bottle.  You can take the trip anytime you want  to with your VCR.  Great for train buffs and anyone who wants a relaxing  viewing experience. Let the kids get an education and not even leave the  house. Glad I invested these will be a joy in my home for years to come!",954806400,6,896,4.074712643678161
