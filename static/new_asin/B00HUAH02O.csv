6208561,5,B00HUAH02O,"The slippery slope from school to prison which exists in our state (OR) and especially in Douglas County would not have happened if we had alternative schools like Greenwood School.  Ken Burns has raised my awareness that a creative, passionate, determined, kind, caring, and dedicated group of people with a leader and a vision prove that change and success are possible.  Thank you Mr. Burns for giving me this seed of hope. It's amazing that Greenwood School has been in existence for 35 years. Why can't this school be a model for education today?  I was riveted to the television set during the entire film. I applaud all the hard work that goes into learning this speech.  It is such an honorable accomplishment and it was just wonderful to see how much pride it brought to all the Greenwood students.  I have purchased the DVD and here's hoping I can share it with as many people as possible.  Greenwood School is a dream come true school and Mr. Burns, you are a national treasure in my opinion.",1397606400,9,1003,4.638418079096045

6208599,5,B00HUAH02O,"I start with full disclosure: I am a fan of Ken Burns and his work.  I was therefore amazed to see this pop up when I was actually working to order ""The Roosevelts"".  As noted by other reviewers, I've no idea how I'd never heard of it before!

If you are an educator, you must experience this film!  If you are a believer in the human spirit you must see this film!  It is very different from what you'd expect of Ken Burns in one way: it is not about the artful presentation of zooms or pans of vintage photos accompanied by masterful script and narration: it is live video, and the participants tell the story.

It is exactly like many of Ken Burn's works in the most important ways.  This is a film of the highest quality.  It enlightens you, you experience the struggles of others, you are lifted up and at the end of it all you gently exhale while breathing on word:

""Wow"".",1411776000,10,879,4.246987951807229

6208601,5,B00HUAH02O,"This is a very special documentary about a real life school in Vermont where the main focus of the students is learning to recite the Gettysburg Address. It is incredibly touching, and really grabbed me. The camera follows various students along their struggles and successes. I was surprised at how this film touched me. So even though I saw in on public television, I just had to order it.",1404172800,6,391,4.681159420289855
6208602,5,B00HUAH02O,Wonderful school ...  great documentary employing maximum use of the people as narrators and subjects .... a minor criticism. We did not really need to see them at Gettysburg.,1403308800,,175,5.0344827586206895
6208603,5,B00HUAH02O,"I had never heard of this film until it I was flipping through the TV channels in March or April of 2014 and it was on my local NPR station.  Ken Burns is one of the best documentary filmmakers-THE best in my opinion.  I've seen many of his films but had not heard of this one which is kind of astonishing since we have a 14-year-old son who has many of the issues that the boys at this school face.

The tradition of the school portrayed is having the boys learn and recite the Gettysburg Address.  Lincoln's most well-known speech but only 2 minutes in length but 2 minutes to a child with a myriad of issues?  Might as well say ""2 hours.""

Even if you do not have a child or know one who has a learning disability and/or mood disorder with the accompanying emotional difficulties with self-esteem and other things, you will be touched greatly by the film.

After I watched The Address for the first time, I looked for and read some reviews and the NY Times wrote a few things that really emphasized just how amazing this film is.  The film may primarily  be about a group of incredible boys but there's a whole lot more.  The teachers, counselors, aides-every single adult at that school was phenomenal. As the Times said, ""For these kinds of students, sometimes a well-trained teacher or other professional has insights that escape even the childs parents.""

In addition to the ""insights"" of the staff was larger message that the Times included in their review-
American culture is identified as very individualistic, and yet theres a tremendous social pressure to conform and to be like everybody else, and to marginalize and pathologize people who function differently in all different kinds of ways, says Tom Ehrenberg, a therapist. I will get parents who will say to me, I just want my kid to be normal, and sometimes I have to say to them: Its not his job to be normal. Its his job to be who he is. 

In the 8 week period in which the boys need to learn The Address, you get to see some amazing things transpire. Not everyone is ready at the end of the 8 weeks but they worked harder than anyone, even themselves, can imagine.  And they don't feel totally defeated if they are not selected to perform.  They know one thing.  Their chance will come in another year.

I bought 2 copies of the DVD in the event that the people I wanted to see it the most, did not have access to it through their TV provider.  And when the credits roll at the end, they show a website that challenges anyone, child or adult, with issues or without to try themselves to memorize it and many have.  And their names are on a separate website if they (""everyman"") did and mine will be up there very soon.  This film is a must-see.  Unbelievably compassionate and uplifting.",1402876800,5,2758,4.4541832669322705
6208604,5,B00HUAH02O,This DVD is a real good look at what can be achieved when working on a small scale with a group of challenged people.  We'll done,1400284800,,129,3.9615384615384617
6208605,4,B00HUAH02O,"This Ken Burns documentary is about a small school in Vermont that seeks to educate boys (11-17) with language-based learning disabilities. The Gettysburg Address is employed at this school as a challenge to learn, as a means to get students to deal with public speaking, and as an idea of new beginnings. Students begin trying to memorize it at the beginning of the school year and in February the school throws a gala social function where parents come to see their children (it is primarily a boarding school, which costs $65,000 a year to attend) recite `The Address' before everyone and compete for who does it the best. Everyone who succeeds without mistakes, however, gets a school commemorative coin as a token of their development.

Most of this video focuses on the students learning the vocabulary of the speech and the meaning behind it, as well as much video of their playing in the Vermont snow, paling around with one another, interacting with teachers in class and playing music.

Why so employ the Gettysburg Address?  I will use the words of one student named Ian: ""When you are angry it is never good but when you have grit and perseverance, you can get through stuff a lot more. This year I'm reciting the Gettysburg and that's huge for me. It just tells people that I'm not stupid. I'm not dumb, I'm not, like, worthless. Every kid that has been bullied excessively, their life is a battlefield and every time you're shot down, you just get---you try to get right back up, but then they just keep shooting you and shooting you. When you're down for the count, either a devil cries and you're done, or the angels sing, they lift you up, they heal you. I want to go up there, I want to nail it, I want to get off, I want to shake [teacher] Stewart's hand and I want to get that coin. It's the turn of a new beginning when that coin hits my hand.""

The film ends with a class trip the National Military Park of Gettysburg (a place every American ought to visit, I should add).",1399766400,25,1994,4.515235457063712

The finale of this one, a recitation event for the parents, brought everyone watching it with me, esp. a group of special ed teachers, to tears! an't express how wonderful and moving this film is.",1463961600,,577,4.8979591836734695
8635821,5,B00HUAH02O,"This Ken Burns documentary is outstanding! I absolutely loved watching it and had to own it. The lives of the young boys are so impacted by the brilliant program of this school they attend. What a blessing for them to have the privilege of working with such powerful mentors.

When they journey to Gettysburg and see for themselves the vastness of the destruction that took place there, they are forever changed. How would it be if all Americans could experience the awakening of awareness that takes place in these young people's lives.

I highly recommend this for anyone who loves learning, teaching, parenting, mentoring, or our Nation's history.",1462406400,,650,5.0092592592592595
8635822,2,B00HUAH02O,"I should have paid more attention to the description.  It is not about the Gettysburg Address but about its use by a school for boys with ""learning differences"" to provide an educational challenge.

It is an example of how students with learning disabilities (in some cases multiple disabilities) can overcome and truly shine. You also get a chance to remember & perhaps relearn one of the greatest speeches of all time! I strongly advise everyone to view this amazing video.",1414108800,6,463,4.948717948717949
