419744,4,6302041090,"...because Barbara Stanwyck never really looked like a babyface to me--she's what the older generation called ""a hard-looking dame"". That notwithstanding, ""Baby Face"" is a real great Pre-Code movie. She's just so evil, right to the core! Baby Face just doesn't care who gets stepped on, cheated on, or even killed, just so long as she gets hers. Early on, she makes her vow to get even with lousy men and take 'em all for a ride, and she does, that is, until she meets that ladykiller, George Brent. Then, complications arise. Personally, I think the ending is a tack-on to soften the story a bit, because it just doesn't ring true to me, the way things were going. But don't take my word for it--see ""Baby Face"" yourself and draw your own conclusions!",995328000,6,752,4.619402985074627
419745,5,6302041090,"Great pre-code (for that matter, brought-on-the-code) little story with vampy little Barbara sleeping her way to the top.  The camera pans up the side of the bank with each new conquest; too bad the last scenes are a bit of a letdown.  But it starts the tradition of Stanwyk going off on a guy, whether it be father (here), lover (Double Indemnity), or husband (Insert movie name here).
Great fun; I hope they put this one on DVD soon- the sight of John Wayne is worth the price of admission alone- it proves, that, yes, he did grow as an actor, as scary as that is.",985996800,,566,4.330188679245283
419746,4,6302041090,"Stanwyck is a typically terrific as an ambitious working girl whose amorous adventures made the Hays Code blush. It's a sharp little melodrama very typical of the day with a fast pace and good performances. A great first half gives ways to the inevitable moral conclusion; John Wayne has a bit in coat & tie and it's a hoot. This video, along with NIGHT NURSE, THREE ON A MATCH among a few others is in the FORBIDDEN HOLLYWOOD series and they're fascinating pre-code doozies (a risque little flick called CONVENTION CITY with Joan Blondell (1933) was apparently destroyed because it was considered too raunchy.  Blondell stated that there wasn't anything offensive about the film; it was just flippantly clever and ""burlesquey"" - what a shame! Also look for LADIES THEY TALK ABOUT.",958521600,5,781,4.916666666666667
419747,4,6302041090,"What a hoot this pre-production code movie is!  Barbara Stanwyck is a calculating woman who gets to the top by taking no prisoners!  Unfortunately, some elements of this story just do not ring true (and  probably didn't back then either).  John Wayne appears in a very small role  as one of ""Baby Face's"" conquests on her way up. I wonder what it  would have been like to have seen this on the large screen back when it was  contriversial--or would I have dared go??",927331200,2,466,4.476190476190476

7820377,5,6302041090,"This was a prinstine copy of ""babyface"" the 1933 version. I'm very happy that I bought it ....",1277942400,,94,4.277777777777778
7820378,5,6302041090,"""Baby Face"" (1933) offers perhaps THE classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want whether it be money or power.

In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. At least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process.

The ending gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled.

Any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start-to-finish and Stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it.",1247097600,,948,4.5
7820379,4,6302041090,"I had the priveledge to see one of the first screenings of the rediscovered un-cut version of this film a few weeks ago at  Brandeis University, and I must say that the New York censor board truly did this film a disservice when it forced the producers to cut and change it. It was really great, but the most interesting part was at the end when they showed clips of the edited version to show what was changed, and it was astounding how rediculous the edits seemed in context of the meaning behind the film.",1130889600,14,508,4.347368421052631
7820380,5,6302041090,"Like many other classic movie buffs, I'm thrilled that the original, uncut and unedited version of ""Baby Face"" has finally been discovered and will likely be released on dvd next year (thanks for the great news, Michael Glancy!). ""Baby Face"" was quite racy for its day and had the censors in an uproar, so much in fact that it was horribly butchered with poor editing (some scenes you can't even hear them finish a sentence before it cuts to the next scene!) and was banned for years. But even the edited version is quite spicy and features one of Barbara Stanwyck's sexiest roles of her entire career!

Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, a young and attractive woman (with ""plenty of experience""!) who is forced to work for her cruel father serving drinks in a speakeasy. When he dies in a not-so-tragic accident, Lily heads for New York City with hopes of earning big money. She lands a job at a huge office building and ""sleeps"" her way from the bottom floor to the top by seducing one boss after another. When she finally discovers true love, she's put in a situation where she can choose money and jewelry, or follow her heart.

""Baby Face"" originally had a very dramatic ending but it was re-shot by the filmmakers because of the idiots of the New York State Board of Censors. I won't tell you details about this because that would spoil the ending. Let's just say it's a great thing that the original version has been discovered, because the uncensored version makes ""Baby Face"" one of the most daring pre-code films of the early 1930's! Stanwyck was stunningly beautiful and gave quite an impressive performance. Although George Brent looked strange without a mustache he was also great. For any pre-code or Barbara Stanwyck fan, this movie is a definite must!",1126224000,17,1761,4.714285714285714
7820381,4,6302041090,"""Baby Face"" is one of the most important pre-code movies. It is amazingly honest and brave in depicting the story of a destitute girl trying to climb to the top. Barbara Stanwyck is simply great in her portrayal of the main character. Hard to imagine any other actress capable of such a magnificent performance. It is very sad that because of the Hayes code instituted in 1934 and that lasted for over thirty years, the great movie traditions of the amazing pre-code movies have been completely lost. It seems that the best of the pre-code movies that have not dated in seventy plus years, have been created in another universe. There is nothing like this in the modern movie making. The only thing that I did not like in the movie was the ending. It seemed contrived and added, probably, at the insistance of the people in charge to soften the harshness of the movie's message.",1102204800,,878,4.634615384615385
7820382,4,6302041090,"Barbara Stanwyck was awesome as she workd her way to the top running through boyfriends.  John Wayne has a small role as one of the boyfriends she runs over.

Hollywood was making really good movies pre-code. Despite being also used, women were empowered in movies then. Then code came in and they weren't even allowed to make suggestive poses.",1099785600,8,344,4.813559322033898
7820383,5,6302041090,"If you are fond of Pre-Code movies you're gonna LOVE this movie, in which Barbara Stanwyck's character, ""works"" her way up, the ""money-ladder"" (rather than the social one, 'cos she's basically a ""kept woman""), ruthlessly and shamelessly, using her sexual attraction on all types of men.
It is Stanwyck's show all the way, with all the men in the cast, playing ""second bananas"" to her pivotal role. She appears dressed in some great-de-luxe early 30's clothing, by Warner's top designer Orry-Kelly.
In spite of the contrived ending, imposed by censors, as well as some cuts it underwent, this picture is thouroughly entertaining, 'cos is fun to watch Barbara getting her way almost all the time. Noteworthy performance by unknown Theresa Harris, as Chico, Stanwyck's pal and maid.
Barbara Stanwyck is one of the all time great american actresses, later films like ""Stella Dallas"", ""Ball of Fire"", ""Meet John Doe"", ""Lady of Burlesque"", ""Double Indemnity"", et al, confirmed her status as one of the top stars of Hollywood's Golden Age.
Highly recommended for Pre-Code Lovers. In fact, a must-see. This movie definitely could not have been done in the second half of the thirties, the forties or the fifties.",1090022400,28,1204,5.085858585858586
