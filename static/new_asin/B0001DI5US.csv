8010851,5,B0001DI5US,"A low-budget 16mm movie made in Baltimore (with some scenes filmed in Havre de Grace, Maryland).  It's not really a sequel to THE ALIEN FACTOR; however, both movies were shot in the Baltimore area and two cast members return in this one, but in different roles.  It's a lot of fun despite the low budget, with very nice effects considering the budget.  Also, this is one you can show to the children.  There are no naughty words, no sexual situations, and there is minimal violence.  Much less violence, in fact,  than your average crime show on network television.  If you like low-budget regional non-gore, no-sex movies, you should like this one!",1430265600,,649,4.792792792792793
8010852,4,B0001DI5US,"Don Dohler's follow-up to his brilliantly hokey ALIEN FACTOR is another example of ultra-low budget done right. I especially liked the cyborg critter. It was a well-constructed alien invader. There's a very high body count in this one, as the hideous marauder traps an entire town within it's time-warping forcefield! No one is safe from the creature's death ray! ALIEN FACTOR 2: ALIEN RAMPAGE is a solid sequel that stands on it's own inexpensive (yet f-u-n) merits...",1198886400,5,469,5.103896103896104
8010853,5,B0001DI5US,"Once again Don Dohler brings us another fantastic low buget
horror movie gem. Alien Factor 2 comes thru with fast paced
action and very solid effects work. The cast is made up of
some old fiends (George Stover, Anne Frith)as well as some
fresh faces like Donna Sherman. Many of the cast can be seen
in Timewarp films first movie Harvesters. Lets hope Retromedia
continues to put out these great films. Also be on the look out
for the Polonia Brothers film The House that Screamed and Tiny
Mike Productions low buget horror film Local Legend the Haw Ridge Devil.",1083283200,6,561,4.62
