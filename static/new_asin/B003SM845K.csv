4188753,2,B003SM845K,"This is a worthwhile documentary to watch as it presents Africa in a new, energyzing way. Much applause is deserved for that.

The film tries to expose Africa in a way it properly deserves. It's rich past is acknowledged, and it's current troubles are explained using an array of opinions. More than 20 different people, mostly academics of one sort or another, participate. Also, as advertised on the cover of the film, we hear some interesting comments from Meles Zenawi (the Ethiopian PM) and Jacob Zuma (South African president).

The film's images are mostly from Ethiopia, and in particular relate to a celebration of the ""Peoples, Nations and Nationalities of Ethiopia"", one big parade that takes place in Addis Ababa where you can see the colourful people's of the country, their variety, their pride and cultural wealth.

So far, so good. But read between the lines (or, better, ""look"" between the lines, because it's a film) and some very disturbing aspects emerge.
Very disturbing.

1. A government minister from Zimbabwe appears, and he qualifies his country's Land Reform as ""an unmitigated success"". Controversial, to say the least. I can think of quite a few Zimbabweans who would challange such opinions (and not only White farmers, i'm referring to the thousands of landless peasants who have seem little benefit from the reform, as in many cases the expropiated land has gone to... to who? Not to them, that's all they know). Obviously they don't get the chance to voice such concerns on the film. A government that simply kicks out half a million residents of Harare for the terrible crime of ""living in shantytowns"" doesn't appear a very sympathetic government to me.

2. Gaddafi (oh yes, ""him"") is well praised for his courageous African Unity agenda. No mention that he trained, armed, and financed, the RUF rebels of Sierra Leone, or the rebellion of Charles Taylor, or was involved in the assassination of Thomas Sankara in Burkina Faso. No, the film chooses to not mention any of that.

3. This is the most disturbing aspect of the film, and it's disturbing when you watch the film in Africa (in Ethiopia, in my case). Of the 20 or more contributors to the film, less than 5 are speaking from within Africa. Some academics, like Prof. Kimani Nehussi among others, mention the problem that ""Africans see Western things as better, or as a solution to their problems"". Right, i see...
This is said by a scholar who teaches at the University of East London, not in Addis Ababa University or Lusaka University. I can already smell the hypocrisy.
Such academics had a problem, ""where to be a scholar"", regardless of the fact if they were African-Americans or Africans or West Indian. As the film clearly, states, they are all Africans, and Love for the Motherland seems to be at the forefront of their aspirations. Or is it?
So why don't work in any African university, contribute to its build-up, instead of moaning on TV that we Africans should know better and not look at the West. Look who's talking!
A professor at Middlesex University's opinion is worth 5 min. of film, not the opinion of a professor at an African university. Some philosopher in Los Angeles can ramble on and on, but no philosopher in Africa is given a voice. Literally, only one gets a chance, a professor of anthropology in Ghana. The rest, living in the West, but talking about Africa, about what Africans should or shouldn't do. Patronising, at the very least.",1318118400,22,3457,4.840947546531303

4188755,5,B003SM845K,"This documentary is like a detailed continuation of ""500 years later"". It incorporated more Africans in the diaspora and their thoughts on the events of the past and present. My only issue was with the 5 African-Americans that spoke, only 2 of them were worthy of respect on this issue: 1 is a government puppet, 1 seemed to use the Civil Rights movement to get himself a white woman and 1 was a sexual sadist who ""saw the error of his ways"".

4188765,2,B003SM845K,"My wife and I watched this DVD twice, and I reflected a lot before writing this review.  This is one of the most challenging and difficult reviews I have written thus far.

In a way, this documentary seems to attempt and explain the guise of human etymology linked to our beginnings in Africa, but it is terribly void of effectively completing an essential understanding of diasporas, evolution of Africa and certainly the ""black"" African mind-set of today and how it was derived.

Essentially, I gather the narrative script works to rationalize an awareness of being African no matter where one is globally, via the concepts of;
1.  Identity (they way one physically looks or profiling)
2.  Nationalism (conceivably, diverse cultures and ethnic clans)

I suppose there might be pros and cons for both.  However, I strongly favor nationalism instead of ""physical features"" - identity - to determine where a person belongs.

As a ""black"" American, having been exposed to 65 countries during my travels, including six sub-Saharan countries on the African continent, I have learned and fully accept that a person should NOT be defined or categorized solely on the basis of the way one looks (profiling).  These misnomers along racial profiling and divisiveness need to cease, and interestingly enough, it is ""black"" Americans among those that scream and cry the loudest about this --- with blind hypocrisy.

Besides, ""black"" Americans are not necessarily ""African Americans.""

There are certainly large groups of nationalized Arabs, ""whites"", and generations of migratory groups from India, Asia and others in Africa... So, exactly how would one categorize them?

How about:
1).  A northern [so-called] European ""looking"" person that has NEVER been anywhere in Europe, and cannot speak any European language or understand European customs.  How can the individual claim to be European?  By ancestral heritage?  What about the culture and nationality of their citizenship?
2).  Or a person with an Asian appearance, but cannot speak any specific Asian language, and is not versed in any of the cultures or practices of Asia --- having never set foot on any Asian territory.  How can this person truly be an Asian, especially considering the pervasive immigration of Chinese through-out Africa over the past 160+ years (and they are fluent in speaking and writing many of the native languages)... So, solely on the basis of the way one might look?
3). Who is it that is really confused, AND when did ""black"" Americans become the all inclusive subject matter experts about ""the Motherland"" --- despite the fact that most have never set foot on the African continent?  Relating to the people and cultures in Africa are as foreign as interpreting quantum physics to most ""black"" Americans.

There are certainly ""blacks"" which are Cuban, Turkish, Brasilian, American, Peruvian, Russian, Asian, European and Scandinavian that have never been to Africa, and cannot relate with African customs and traditions.

Why is this documentary so truant, devoid, and lacking of African voices?  Where are the  voices and perspectives of the; Ugandans, Tanzanians, Central African Republic or even the Gambians to name just a few? Much tends to be centered on Ethiopia while African voices through-out the entire continent remain excluded and rcitant.  Ethiopians have diverse indigenous cultures as South Africa, and they certainly do not all get along, respect one another or share similar perspectives and social ideologies.

This is nothing more than another ""black"" American feel good, mind controlling, pandering and illusionary documentary with more omission than reality.

When I am abroad in Africa, if I kept silent, I could blend in rather well, especially in Nigeria (until I speak and my behavior is discerned).  An African person from Nigeria tells you that they are Nigerian.  The same with a Zambian, Egyptian, Kenyan, Ghanaian or South African.
Secondly, they tend to IDENTIFY themselves based upon tribal affiliations; Zulu, Ndebele, Luba, Shona, Yoruba, Dogon, Mossi, Bamileke, etc.  Africans do not practice a proclamation of the title of an African first or foremost (if at all).  The structure of societies are more complex than what meets the eye.  African cultural and tribal variances leave a lot to be understood.  Some of the colloquial terms and gestures can really be disheartening if one learns to understand them on more than a superficial level.

Besides, ""black"" African indigenous peoples also have been conditioned by others beyond ""whitey"" --- for example, Arab and other dominant indigenous tribal assimilation as well as tribal abuses. Hence, many of the problems in the MOTHERLAND are often and remain  precarious...",1347580800,8,4733,5.25832223701731
