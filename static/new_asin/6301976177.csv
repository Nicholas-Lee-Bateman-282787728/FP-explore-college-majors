419767,5,6301976177,"Jenny Stewart (Joan Crawford) is a tough Broadway musical star who doesn't take criticism from anyone. Yet there is one individual, Tye Graham (Michael Wilding), a blind pianist who may be able to break through her tough exterior.  Joan puts the ""C"" in CAMP with one of her most outrageous performances ever! With flaming ""orange"" hair (yes ORANGE hair!) she's once again the tough broad that love's done wrong.  The ""camp"" meter goes from low to over-the-top with the ""Two Faced Woman"" musical number, which has Joan in ""brown face"" and some really ridiculous routines!  Thanks to a close friend, I finally got to see this Joan Crawford ""camp"" classic!  Loads of fun! Joan's ""Torch Song"" belongs on every ""Camp Collector's"" DVD library shelf and is long overdue for a proper DVD release!  Viva la Joan!

**UPDATE!** ""Torch Song"" is now on DVD in ""The Joan Crawford Collection Volume 2"" Hooray!!  And all of you ""Joan Crawford"" fans, PLEASE DON'T MISS! Joan in ""Daisy Kenyon"" which is FINALLY on DVD!! and is part of the Fox Film Noir DVD series! And to all Joan Crawford fans and die-hards keep requesting MORE of Joan's movies to be released on DVD, these titles prove that the studios ARE listening!!",1179360000,3,1203,4.782608695652174
419768,5,6301976177,"If ever proof positive of the genius talent of Joan Crawford were needed to, say, save children from a burning building, all the fire department need do is look no further than this horrifying shambles of a movie. Yes, boys and girls, such is the strength of Crawford's performance as heartless tuneless theatre virago Jenny Stewart, that it propels this dull little movie from the lowly ranks of Pointlessness, right into the glorious lap of You Have Got To See This Right Now.

Put simply, Joan's an Atlas, carrying the combined weight of a pointless screenplay and an even more uninspiring supporting cast on her bullish, fabulous shoulders, and before God, she makes this otherwise-awful mess into an enjoyable laugh-a-minute tale of hate, love and redemption.

Swaddled in !!!GLORIOUS TECHNICOLOR!!! (honestly, there's a peignoir so !!!YELLOW!!! draped around Ms. Crawford in one of the earlier scenes that it's won't to give you shingles), Jenny Stewart begins to fall in love with her new blind piano accompanist Tye Graham (artless Michael Wilding, delivering his lines with about as much passion as a dead rock), but, since the teensy little pinprick of despair that used to be her heart won't let her have any feelings, Jenny tries her hand at reverse psychology, and does her level best to make Tye think that she, in fact, HATES him. Trotting out every single cliche from insulting his education to inferring bestiality (with his seeing-eye dog, a BULLDOG, yet! Metaphorical, perhaps?), Tye Graham, that brave little soldier, remains undeterred, and dauntlessly marches on, secure in the knowlege that one day the shrieking, glowering, generally hateful Ms. Stewart will belong to him. Brave man...

Okay, so firstly, there's nothing to write home about as regards the performances of the supporting cast, screenplay or direction. Bog-standard post-Busby-Berkley fare, and quite disjointed in places. This, lest ye be mistook, was ONLY ever going to be Joan's show, and, rather than simply chew the scenery, La Crawford merely parts her VERY BRIGHT RED LIPS and points to her mouth, and the scenery jumps down her throat all of its own accord. It's THRILLED to be along for the ride!

As should we all be.

Secondly, I can't really put into words how very wrong the use of colour is in this picture. The whole production seems to be deliberately designed in shades of off-grey and drab sludge, with the express purpose of throwing Joan Crawford's hair, makeup and de rigeur preposterous wardrobe into even higher relief. The !!!YELLOW!!! nightie is but one offender: other Gowns Of Note (And Mistake) include the Two-Faced Woman blue spangled extraveganza, and the tie-on flouncy skirt (with bejewelled waist-spikes, attached). Joan's hair colour deserves a special mention here, too: whatever Sidney Guilaroff mixed to create that flaming crown of doom, he obviously had to wear protective lens. It's not just orange, it's !!!HUGE BIG ORANGE!!! and by God, Joan's got the moxy to wear it, see?!?

However, nowhere in this all-singing, all-dancing, all-laughing catastrophe is the use of colour more pronounced (and inappropriate!!) than in the 'Two-Faced Woman' musical number. Joan does it, and she does it in blackface. When she tears off her black pageboy wig at the number's end, the shocking contrast between her chocolate-brown face paint, !!!HUGE BIG ORANGE!!! hair, bleeding red lips and (and this is my favourite part) blue forhead-sequins (no, I am not making this up!) is not just shocking: it IS how it feels when doves cry.

And finally, just to add to the despair/comedy value of the picture, India Adams' voice (Joan was dubbed: watch that clip of her ""singing""  a song called 'Got a feelin' for you' in the documentary on the flipside of the 'Mildred Pierce' DVD and you'll understand why this was necessary) is a hoot. Literally. Actually, not so much a Hoot as a Primal Bellow. Watch Joan !!!EMOTE!!! during the plainly dubbed rehearsal scenes and I promise you, even the Almighty Faye Dunaway screeching about wire and hatchets and box-office poison in 'Mommie Dearest' will lose some of its sparkle.

Joan Crawford is my favourite actress of all time. In 'Humoresque', 'Rain', 'Mildred Pierce', 'Possessed 1947', 'The Women', 'Grand Hotel', 'Baby Jane' and so, so many others, she's a luminous, magnetic, enthralling powerhouse of talent, and a genuine delight to watch.

In 'Torch Song', she's better than she's ever been before, but sadly, for all the wrong reasons.

And if nothing else, you HAVE to give the woman credit for beating seven shades of merry hell out of this dreadful, dreadful film.

Watch it, and laugh every ounce of water out of your body. But for heaven's sake, do it with protective goggles on.",1162425600,19,4750,5.052362707535122
419769,4,6301976177,"""WHO WOULD PAY MONEY TO SEE THIS?""

Now, don't get us wrong - we're not talking about the actual movies. This is about performances within performances - when, within the context of a movie, an actor or actress playing a performer gets to perform onstage. We're not talking about musicals, in which the songs move the story along, but ""staged"" performances that occur within the story. Nightclub or theatre scenes, for instance, in which we get to see what's happening onstage. Let's take *I'll Cry Tomorrow* (1956) starring Susan Hayward as an example. Susan plays Lillian Roth, a nightclub singer on the skids. Over the course of the movie, we see her perform onstage repeatedly, including Lillian's signature number, ""When The Red, Red Robin Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along."" Now, frankly, it's hard to imagine a time when a song like that could have been a major hit on the charts, but this is, indeed, what the movie would have us believe. As we are subjected to Susan as Lillian whirling around in a big fluffy skirt, singing her sincere little heart out, with this stupid song and it's ludicrous words, and, yet, the audience is screaming for more, and the movie viewer is left, slack-jawed, wondering, ""What are these people screaming for? Who would pay money to see that?""

Who Would Pay Money To See That (WWPMTST)? is a question that my illustrious sister Margaret and I ask frequently while viewing many of our favorite movies. And they *are* our favorite movies, in spite of (or often *because* of) these hideous performances. *Mildred Pierce* (1945), an otherwise superior movie, contains a truly repellant performance of Ann Blyth, magnificently playing the treacherous daughter, Veda. Veda gets thrown out of the house and becomes a singer in a waterfront dive. When her mother, played by Joan Crawford, of course, goes to find her, we enter the scene just as Veda is performing her big number - some unnamed atrocity about a guy named Billy McCoy. As she hulas around the stage in some sort of South Seas (via Hollywood) sarong and lei, the effect is supposed to be tawdry. It's not. It's ridiculous, and it sorely tests the imagination to watch the nightclub patrons in the movie actually sit through the entire song. Thank God, Joan shows up just in time and puts a stop to it. But, Joan, herself, has turned in some pretty horrible performances-within-performances. *Torch Song* (1953) has an aging Joan playing Jenny Stewart - an entertainer of some sort. But the experience of watching Jenny ""entertain"" asks more questions than it answers - we see her rehearse a lot, and be mean to Michael Wilding, but when the big ""Two-Faced Woman"" number happens, watch out. Joan, as Jenny, is pure drag queen as she glares and flounces her way through the song, also with a big skirt. She and her sleazy backup dancers (sort of a Fifties version of the Solid Gold dancers) all appear to be wearing something that looks suspiciously like blackface, as they try to drape themselves seductively on caf tables - the performance defies even the possibility that the number might have been good, even when the movie first came out.

The big skirt is often an important aspect of ""WWPMTST?"" *The Opposite Sex* (1956) starring June Allyson, requires several viewings to fully appreciate the sheer badness of the musical numbers. June, playing a retired radio singer, Kay Ashley, isn't responsible for *all* of them, but she has a real lulu, ""Young Man With A Horn,"" performed with (and in homage to) trumpeter Harry James. She mugs her way through the song, wearing a demure little sweater and a great big chiffon skirt that she works mercilessly, spinning and flipping the skirt so much, like frothy waves on the beach, that it becomes the focus of the scene. This is known as ""skirt-dancing"" and, employed in many movies, is often a last resort to keep the viewer's mind from wandering, and asking the obvious question, ""WWPMTST?"" *The Opposite Sex* provides several other numbers that beg that same question. Part of the plot (a musical remake of *The Women*) revolves around a Broadway show that's being produced, called ""Yellow Gold,"" about, naturally, the banana-growing industry. Sounds delightful already, right? We are ""treated"" to the splashy title tune from the show-within-a-show, in which some queen in tight toreador pants is singing ""There's yellow gold in the trees *de banana*..."" while Joan Collins and Joan Blondell, among others, conga around the stage in nightmarish neon outfits that make them look like jungle mermaids. Truly horrendous, and almost unwatchable. Almost. But stick with it - the very question of ""WWPMTST?"" occurs with such alarming regularity, that you *know* you're witnessing greatness.

Often, the most difficult-to-fathom aspects has to do with entertainment that modern audiences would be mystified by - the propensity towards finding singing hobos, newsboys and clowns entertaining would escape today's sophisticated viewers over the age of six. *A Star Is Born* (1954) is loaded with opportunities that beg the question, ""WWPMTST?"" Not that it's Judy Garland's fault - she sings like an angel whether she's dressed as a hobo, newsboy or clown, but perhaps, again, the problem dates back what was considered entertaining at that particular time. The era of vaudeville is often conjured up in movies, such as this one, and is sentimentally portrayed as a simpler era catering to simpler tastes. Simple-minded is more like it, if we are to believe that hats and canes and happy darkies are necessary accoutrements for entertainment. Of course, the ""WWPMTST?"" question does not apply to scenes that are awful by intention - the Iris, the Hand-Walking Queer routine from *Beaches* (1988) is so repulsive that the director achieved exactly what he wanted. On the other hand, *Dirty Dancing* (1987) gives us Jane Brucker as Baby's sister Lisa, who performs her own rather South Seas ""Billy McCoy""-ish number in a talent show. A few bars of it would have sufficed, but the director makes us wince and squirm through the entire interminable song, and it seems particularly evil of him, since, while the audience on the screen might have conceivably enjoyed the performance, the audience in the theatres paid dearly, and not just in dollars.

The ""WWPMTST?"" Hall of Fame award goes to *Valley of the Dolls* (1967) in which every single staged performance in the film is abysmal. When Patty Duke, as Neely O'Hara, performs a song called, ""It's Impossible"" on a telethon within the movie, it is not only impossible, it is painful. The song is schlock, and Neely, in a silly sweater and skirt, is completely upstaged by the double strand of beads she is wearing. As she tosses herself side-to-side to convey emotion, her beads first loop themselves over one breast, and then over the other, and finally, over both at the same time - an unintentionally hypnotic moment, that manages to take your mind off the ever-present question, ""WWPMTST?"" One of the most unbearable scenes is the torturous and treacly ""Come Live With Me"" nightclub number performed by the completely talent-free Tony Scotti as that hot new singing sensation Tony Polar. The sole redeeming factor is getting to see him reprise the song on drugs in a wheelchair. Then there's the girdled-to-the-gills Susan Hayward as the vicious stage star Helen Lawson, singing some dreadfulness called ""I Plant My Own Tree"" as an Alexander Calder mobile swirls around her. The Helen Lawson character was based upon Ethel Merman, who was responsible for *many* ""WWPMTST?"" performances, herself. It's extremely difficult to imagine her becoming a star now, and equally hard to watch her perform.  As if the song itself weren't enough to make you wonder ""WWPMTST?"" the hair and dress that Susan, as Helen/Ethel wears makes you wonder ""Did she pay someone money to make her look like this?"" It is a low point in film history, as you watch a great actress playing a dreadful actress, singing an awful song from a bad show within a truly horrible movie. Truly horrible, and exquisite in its trashiness. *I'd* pay money for *that*.",1106438400,9,8112,4.9698085419734905
419770,3,6301976177,"""Torch Song"" is fun to watch, but not as much so as I'd expected. Parts of it are downright dull, and one really has to pay attention to have any clue what's going on.
 I still don't know why everyone seems to practically worship Jenny Stewart( Joan Crawford), especially when she's such a pill. The only reason that Jenny falls for Tye( Michael Wilding) is that he WON""T take her abuse. She respects him, I guess. But she seems very confident that he'll melt like everybody else when she decides to beckon. Yeah, sure.
 My favorite part is when, in a typical hissy after the ""Two-Faced Woman"" number( calls to mind Meredith Brooks' ""I'm a B****"")Jenny rips off her black wig, revealing orange hair that is rather jarring combined with her fake-mulatto makeup. Yuck.
And she's even grouchy with Michael Wilding's guide dog. Carol Burnett's parody, ""Torchy Song"", is lots better than the original. Devout Joan Crawford fans( and there are bound to be some) should opt for ""Mildred Pierce"" instead.",1084492800,7,996,4.818713450292398
419771,4,6301976177,"This is not the great movie it was intended to be but Crawford (as in Joan) camps it up in questionable taste and the viewer is not disappointed. As usual, she plays a tough dame (not her fault) who's misunderstood (not her fault) who learns the hard way (her fault) the true meaning of love. Whew! And do we roll with the punches! Her costumes are DELUXE 50's to-die-for and her makeup so thick you'd have to crack it with an icepick. Allegedly, she had a face and breast lift before starting this picture and maybe that's why she looks so tight. But her hair color is what's really odd---ORANGE! As stage star Jenny, she cuts everyone down to chopped meat but stays loyal to her fans because they truly ""love"" her unconditionally. But a blind pianist ( a cowed Michael Wilding) crosses her orbit and -BOOM!- she enters a state of confusion over ""is it love?"" and it takes her alcoholic money-grubbing mother ( a splendid Marjorie Rambeau) to wake her up. Whew! Are we there yet? Almost. The musical numbers are WAY out there---esp. the ""Two-Faced Woman"" number ----in brownface!...(she was supposed to be mulatto) but dear God, what was she or anyone else THINKING?

Ther is the famous Two- Faced Woman number with Joan in black face that stuns even after many viewings. How did Joan get the nerve to do it?  It was done by Cyd Charissse and cut from a film she made of it and as great as Cyd is, Joan's is more arresting, and of course crazy. What can equal this in musical film history?  Maybe Lost Horizon (1973)??

When her accompanist finally has enough and quits, blind Michael Wilding takes his place and drives Joan crazy by being unable to admire her fabulous ""beauty"" like everyone else does (by the time she was in her fifties, as she is here, lantern-jawed, huge-eyebrowed Joan looked like an unsuccessful drag queen).
Soon, against her will, Joan finds herself falling in love with her new accompanist (when she's not yelling at him or telling him to ""find a nice seeing eye girl"").  Seems he's the one man in the world who doesn't knuckle under to her, and she likes that.  She's also feeling that the life of a rich, famous Broadway star who wears a new haute couture outfit every day is, after all, an empty one.  Wouldn't it be nice to settle down and just be some ordinary man's wife?  After all, that's the very bestest thing any woman can be.  But will Michael want to play house with her?

""Joan, would you like to return to MGM?""
""Yes!""
""You'll be singing...""
""Yes! Yes!""
""You'll be dancing...""
""Where's the contract????""
""You'll be in Technicolor....""
""Do you have a pen?  Barkeep, bring me another!!""
""And you'll be in blackface""
""Who cares??  It's METRO!!!!!!""

And so the Academy Award winning Joan Crawford returned to her beloved MGM to make this monstrosity.  Joan plays a musical/comedy (???) star or some sort of show-biz variety entertainer.  For starters, she can't dance.  She's a cow with toes.  Her singing is dubbed by India Adams and the songs are terrible.  The costume designer must have been drunk as well.  Or hated her.  The film opens with her tight face and long legs and wickedly red, angry hair.  And her belt has bells.  Jingly, jangly things that get in the way.  There's the bright yellow robe.  The pale blue pajamas.  Her black cocktail dress.

As her co-star, Michael Wilding has woefully little to do other than sit there all serene while Joan dumps abuse, abuse, and then more abuse, on his blind self.  Anyone else would've belted her in the face but oh wait...she DOES get belted in the face by whomever dreamed up the ""Two Faced Woman"" number.  It's a stunner.  In black face.  She doesn't dance at all, just makes her body as stiff as a board while chorus boys carry her and mulatto women pound the tables.  It's one of the oddest musical moments on film that I've ever seen.  She is garishly dressed in some blue/aqua/green thing and then, to top it off, rips off her black wig and there she is, in all her Technicolor glory, with red fat lips, orange orange hair, and black face!!!!!

This is MGM?  This is a Charles Walters directed picture?  He, of ""Easter Parade"", ""Summer Stock"", ""Good News""?  Hard to imagine.

The dialogue is all camp all the way and while it CAN be fun, it is an embarassment at the same time.  There is nothing about Joan's performance, the musical numbers, the sets, the wardrobe, to recommend.  It's not just a train wreck, what makes it such and unforgettable train wreck is the fact that Joan, who should've known better, is running the train.  Full speed ahead.  Holding on to her stardom.",1335830400,4,2248,4.682051282051282
7820391,5,6301976177,"In 1953 Joan Crawford returned to her old studio MGM after a 10 year absence. When ""Sudden Fear"", Joan's 1952 independent film, was a huge box office and commercial success (the movie garnered Crawford her third and final Oscar nomination as Best Actress) MGM offered her a two-picture deal. The first movie was ""Torch Song"", a film about a hard-as-nails Broadway star who falls in love with her new pianist who is blind. The pianist was played by Michael Wilding who at the time was dating Elizabeth Taylor with whom Crawford was having a real-life feud with. Joan, at one point, even banned Liz from the MGM sound stages during filming! Rumor had it that Joan was envious and jealous of Taylor's success as an up and coming movie actress and wanted nothing to do with her.

 ""Torch Song"", however, bombed at the box office, and immediately MGM, again, parted ways with Joan and her second feature was scrapped.

 The film is not terrible, but it is not Oscar worthy either although Marjorie Rambeau, who played Joan's mother in the film, received a Best Supporting Actress nom . The script is pretty decent and the performances are good, but the thing just didn't jell. I always felt Joan was too tough in the role, an attribute she would bring to most of her 1950's films. Perhaps if Crawford had softened her character's portrayal audiences would have responded more nicely.

 Joan actually loved doing ""Torch Song"". She stated, ""It was absolutely a field day for an actress, especially one that had reached a certain age. I was able to act, dance, and pretend to sing (her voice was overdubbed).

 The most distubing part of the movie for me is the fact that during filming in the summer of 1953, according to Joan's adopted daughter Christina, Joan had tried to kill her during a violent argument at Joan's Brentwood home. When you watch ""Torch Song"" you can see, not only the toughness Joan possessed, but the anger and bitterness she had from real life. Perhaps she was tired of fighting to keep her career alive at this point in her life and perhaps her alcoholism was getting out of hand. Whatever the reason for her convincing portrayal as Jenny Stewart one gets the impression it wasn't at all acting.

 ""Torch Song"" was finally released on DVD a few years back in widescreen on the ""Joan Crawford Box Set: Part 2"", but never released as an individual stand-alone disc.",1292457600,,2381,4.701923076923077
7820392,5,6301976177,"As someone who watches all of Joan's movies on a fairly regular basis I can most certainly say that ""Torch Song"" is not one of my favorites. But I don't think it's fair to compare it to Joan's other movies, especially to any of the other movies that she made during this time period (the '50s) because all of her movie roles were so diverse and unique.

I enjoy ""Torch Song"" though because it's just so over-the-top and in-your-face. This was Joan's first really great color movie, too and the studio pulled out all of the stops for her. MGM had a huge campaign advertising their Queen and their ""new"" MetroColor that was used to process this film.

In ""Torch Song"" Joan plays Jenny Stewart, a performer who is as hard as brick. She is a woman who knows what she wants and says what she means. The movie included many impressive dance routines the final one with Joan's face painted is just too ludicrous for words, though.

Joan's co-star in the film is Michael Wilding, who plays Tye Graham, a blind pianist who helps Jenny with her comeback. Incidentally, while filming the picture Michael Wilding's wife Liz Taylor walked onto the set and passed right by Joan without saying a peep to her. Of course Joan was very offended and hurt by this snub. And Joan made sure she let the head of MGM know that this disrespectful girl will never enter her set again without saying something. The following day Elizabeth Taylor had the decency to speak to Miss Crawford.

Joan loved ""Torch Song"" because it gave her a chance to do so many different things and play a character that was so different for her. Once speaking about this project, she said, ""I loved doing this film. It gave me a chance to dance, to pretend to sing, to emote all over the place, and in color, yet.""

The movie is also shown on TCM at least a few times a year, too.

And here it is more than 50 years later and this film is still loved by fans the world over. That is because Joan, in all of her movie roles, no matter what type of charter she portrayed was always so universally identifiable. She personified the American dream.",1263600000,2,2413,4.760765550239235

Surely, the Joan Crawford in this laughably over-the-top 1953 melodrama must have been Faye Dunaway's direct inspiration for her lacerating impersonation of the screen legend in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mommie-Dearest/dp/B000ERVJK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mommie Dearest</a>. The garishly Technicolor film marked Crawford's highly trumpeted return to MGM after she was unceremoniously pushed out in the early 1940's only to make a comeback at Warner Brothers in a series of meaty roles in classic films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mildred-Pierce/dp/B0008ENIAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mildred Pierce</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Humoresque/dp/B0008ENI98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Humoresque</a>&nbsp;and prove she had the chops to handle older roles. It's too bad this is such a silly vehicle because Crawford, hovering around fifty at that point in her career, seems determined to make something substantial out of it. With her hair a flaming orange and her face severely tightened, she plays a disagreeably vainglorious Broadway diva named Jenny Stewart, a musical comedy star that seems to have all of Margo Channing's insecurity but little of her scathing wit. Instead, Crawford is made to snarl the lines in John Michael Hayes and Jan Lustig's limp screenplay without any noticeable irony.

Everyone kowtows to Jenny and cowers when she has her frequent outbursts, everyone except Tye Graham, a blind pianist hired to be her accompanist. Of course, they will inevitably fall in love, but this absurdity occurs almost in a vacuum since director Charles Walters seems more interested in showing Jenny as a raging harpy when she isn't acting pitiable in the privacy of her bedroom. For an MGM production, the movie looks surprisingly budget conscious and contains only one fully-costumed production number, the amazingly offensive and badly choreographed ""Two-Faced Woman"" which Crawford and a chorus of dancers perform in blackface (!). It has to be seen to be believed. Crawford's singing voice is dubbed by an emphatic singer named India Adams, not the worst offense at the time since such lip-syncing was pervasive. As a dancer, Crawford likes to show off her still-impressive gams, but her moves are so slow and deliberately minimized that Carol Burnett's years-later parody looks all the more accomplished by comparison.

Michael Wilding simply looks embarrassed as Tye, especially in the final wrap-up scene that requires him to have an excessive tantrum, and an extremely disengaged Gig Young is wasted (and looks wasted) as a sycophantic drunk leeching off Jenny. The one scene that works is between Jenny and her beer-guzzling mother, played with unapologetic relish by Marjorie Rambeau. They actually seem related. The 2008 DVD contains several extras - a 14-minute retrospective featurette called ""Tough Baby: Torch Song"", a PSA for the Jimmy Fund featuring Crawford at home with her subservient children, an audio clip of her recording session (apparently done before the decision was made to dub her voice), a vintage MGM cartoon and short, and the original theatrical trailer. It's just not good enough to be considered a camp classic, but there are moments that truly defy logic.",1206316800,6,3765,6.292635658914729
