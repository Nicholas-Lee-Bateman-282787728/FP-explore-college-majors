6751223,5,B00OHLR4JS,Great insight into Studio Ghibli... A must watch if you are interested in animation of any kind!,1419292800,,96,4.705882352941177
6751224,2,B00OHLR4JS,"I love Hayao Miyazaki's work to the point of obsession. I've seen almost every film to come out of Studio Ghibli. And yet I found this movie to be one of the most boring documentaries I have ever seen. It's intimate and sentimental, but incredibly dull and without insight. What a wasted opportunity.",1419033600,2,300,4.679245283018868
6751225,5,B00OHLR4JS,"If you like Studio Ghibli or are a fan of Hayao Miyazaki, this is a documentary I highly recommend. If you have never seen any of his films (especially The Wind Rises) I suggest watching them first. It was a realistic perspective of the inner workings of the studio, although it was almost entirely about Miyazaki and his work on animation, particularly the Wind Rises.

There's a little bit of other stuff, but those hoping for a deep look into his personal life will be disappointed. However, that's not what the movie claims to be. There was a very brief scene involving his son Goro, who directed Tales from Earthsea, and to my knowledge no mention of his wife or other child. It's clear that making films is his true passion, and that he is truly irreplaceable.

It's a wonderful look into one of my favorite directors, but also somewhat saddening since it makes you realize that Studio Ghibli simply will not be the same without him. Sure, the other artists, musicians, etc. are a critical role. But the storyboard that ties it all together is the magical key that Miyazaki is able to bring, hence his films being huge successes.

All in all I would recommend this to basically anyone who knows who Miyazaki is, since without that the documentary won't mean much to you.",1418947200,15,1276,4.6371681415929205
6751226,5,B00OHLR4JS,Exactly what would be expected from Miyazaki-san. Enjoy!,1418860800,,56,6.125
6751227,5,B00OHLR4JS,"Want to know a little more about the makers behind your favorite Studio Ghibli animated films?

The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness is a fascinating documentary that gives a glimpse into the daily life of Miyazaki and the people of Studio Ghibli. Although this peek reveals that not all is magical rainbows and sparkling dew drops at the studio, what does one expect? Even amazing work, at an amazing company with amazing people is still a challenge. I think this documentary does well by showing varied and realistic slices of Miyazaki, the studio and life in general in the creative field of traditional animation.

Some other reviews make Miyazaki and the film sound quite depressing, but though the film seems to realistically portray the ups and downs of this creative life, it seems to always veer towards the positive spectrum of a situation, and does so over and over again. Though the filmmaker captures Miyazaki making statements that, at face value, seem to reveal a bleak outlook on life; if one observes his subtle expressions, it does not appear that he literally means ""filmmaking only brings suffering."" to be so doom and gloom as it sounds on paper. Delivery is everything, and Miyazaki delivers such lines with a giggle and a childlike smile. It seems more to me as though Miyazaki is saying that his work is not easy, but that he wouldn't have it any other way.

Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki fans are highly likely to enjoy this documentary, with its insights into the people and culture behind the beloved animations, as well as that glimmer of hope that is revealed in the final moments of the film.",1418688000,9,1612,4.812274368231047
6751228,4,B00OHLR4JS,"The short version: The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness is a very engaging and beautifully shot documentary that deserves your attention. But given what it's covering, there's so much more than that!

It demonstrates respect for a brand that's bound to have an impact long after its films have been dissected frame by frame. In fact, that's what you'll see in one scene: a film being made frame by frame! Despite how bittersweet the movie feels overall, it's still a joy to watch. It offers a vivid look into the lives of the people that make up Studio Ghibli, particularly producer Toshio Suzuki, Isao Takahata (as a reference to his elusiveness, his present-day onscreen appearance is humorously relegated to the end of the film; you'll just have to watch and see where), and Hayao Miyazaki himself. Not surprisingly, most of the documentary's focus is on him, and also not surprisingly, he's actually a pretty cool guy.

The movie spends no time giving you a crash course on Miyazaki's legacy, because it already assumes you're more than aware of it. Yet, because how inviting this film is, I still can't help but recommend it to those unfamiliar with his or Studio Ghibli's work. For whatever reason, as of this review, Amazon Instant Video does not offer this movie digitally in HD, but I imagine that might change soon. For now, at least, your best bet for owning a digital copy of this film is Google Play, where's it's $13 in HD, as opposed to $20 in HD on iTunes. Those who plan to watch The Wind Rises without any spoilers should refrain from watching this movie before then. A primary focus of this documentary is the studio's work on the animated film leading up to its Japanese release in 2013. One ""subplot"" of the documentary goes into great detail on Miyazaki's struggle with storyboarding the very last scene of The Wind Rises.

Keep in mind that this film is intentionally paced to slowly unveil a process that's yielded such an influence to our culture. It evokes a point of view and reveals nothing more, so this isn't a documentary in the strictest sense. It's not a 2-hour compilation of archive footage and clips from animated classics. Rather, we're simply given a snapshot of a complicated legend, one who admittedly recognizes how time has diminished his passion and interests in filmmaking. It's almost unsettling just hearing him downplay the relevance of cinema, shortly after he has returned home from the studio one night and is about to light a cigarette. [UPDATE 1/26/15: I originally misheard a quote from Miyazaki about his take on Porco Rosso; it has now been corrected in this review] He's modest in the most complex way, at one point criticizing his own movie, Porco Rosso, for being targeted at adults instead of kids, to the point of even describing it as ""foolish""!

But perhaps that's a clever trick that this documentary pulls off. As the film shows, he has inborn faults and stubborn beliefs just like us regular non-Miyazaki people. That only makes his contributions towards art all the more extraordinary and relatable. While it would've been worthwhile for The Kingdom of Dreams & Madness to have spent more time outside of the framework of The Wind Rises' film production, the audience gets the rare treat of seeing Hayao Miyazaki making his impact on paper and in real life. That's good enough for me, and it should be good enough for anime fans everywhere (although self-proclaimed Otakus may not enjoy a certain comment Miyazaki says in one scene...). I recommend this documentary even for those who may have only heard of the Studio Ghibli name and wondered what all the fuss was about. Contrary to what the legendary animator himself says, Studio Ghibli is more than just a name. And Hayao Miyazaki is more than just a filmmaker.",1418169600,55,3779,4.809230769230769

6751251,5,B00OHLR4JS,"For year, since I was a child, I have been imagining how Miyazaki would be like as a person. Thanks to this documentary, for the first time, I could see him this up close.
It's hard to describe my feelings with words. But this is a very good documentary. It lets Miyazaki to talk about his own story, his own perspective, laying them out in an almost mundane manner, that you almost didn't realize this is a Master, one of THE MASTER, in the world. You just submerge in the feeling of heart-to-heart conversation and wisdoms from one person to another person, about life and the world.

I hope he keeps making animation films...he gave me a blue sky when i was a child, that will always be in my heart.",1452470400,4,702,4.358778625954199

6751253,5,B00OHLR4JS,"I've always loved Miyazaki's films, and suspected that the man behind them would be simpatico.  What this film shows of him not only confirms that, but raises him to hero status.  The documentary maker did an amazing job, capturing beautiful footage and interesting moments that have, uniformly, a sense of honesty to them.  Perhaps the greatest praise I could give this outstanding, wonderful film, is that it gave me the desire to be a better person, and a glimpse into the life of a great man.",1446854400,,496,4.744186046511628

6751257,5,B00OHLR4JS,"Having been a fan of Miyazaki's work for the past 20 years, I knew that I would appreciate a look inside the doors of studio ghibli. What I was not expecting was to be awestruck by the immense talent of the man and to feel like he was looking through the screen and into my soul. The gifts he has given human civilization should not be undervalued. He has held something precious to show the children of the world, as long as there is one.",1440979200,,439,4.176470588235294

6751266,5,B00OHLR4JS,"This is a very informative movie on the inner workings of Studio Ghibli. This documentary also gives insight into Miyazaki's own personal habits and perspectives. I found it interesting how he almost has a pessimistic view on animation and he is humble to the extent of considering himself ""unimportant"".

And its true, although his films may not provide real world positives changes, I think they still provide a unique beauty. All in all, he is correct about the industry being a giant hobby or sort, with no real impact other than to let people escape to some imaginary fantasy.",1431734400,,581,4.8686868686868685

6751282,5,B00OHLR4JS,I am a huge fan of Studio Ghibli Movies. I consider this a must see for a fan of the studios work.  It was a real treat to see how Hayao Miyazaki works and thinks. This move shows the period during the making of The Wind Also Rises up until the point were Miyazaki-San makes his decision to retire.  Particularly enjoyable is the chance to just see what the animation studio looks like inside. Seeing the desks and roof garden is very interesting. I found the subtitles done on this work to be very well done. I watch lots of programing with english subtitles that is in Japanese and often the subtitles are a bit off.,1429574400,,618,4.318965517241379

I found it fascinating to here their side of things and can easily see where they came up with the title to this documentary. I still highly respect Miyazaki and find him to be a remarkable man. I liked how they didn't really speak much about Studio Gibbli and just went into how things worked and what they did. You got some new facts but they didn't give you a back history of things you already knew.

I was personally quite pleased with this documentary and thought it was handled well. I liked hearing what workers had to say as well as simply watching their daily routines. How you could practically set a watch by Miyazaki at least when he arrived and left work, and how they had exercise during work. It was truly a nice little window into their lives and I very much enjoyed it.",1427414400,,881,4.244047619047619

6751289,5,B00OHLR4JS,"At the end of a person's life, they want to be able to look back and think they've done something...accomplished something.  As he creates his final film, The Wind Rises, Miyazaki ruminates on his life, career, personality and craft.  He reveals himself to be a demanding and difficult perfectionist.  A prickly eccentric with a soft, whimsical side and a gently self-deprecating sense of humor.  He reveals how The Wind Rises is meant to be psychologically autobiographical.  Having seen The Wind Rises, I think Miyazaki is trying to convey a sense of nostalgia, a desire to make a real impact and the trials and tribulations of success and failure and the tremendous dedication and time it takes to be successful at one's chosen profession.",1426464000,,742,5.0
6751290,5,B00OHLR4JS,"Oh how can I begin to describe this movie?  Wonderful, enlightening, interesting and heartbreaking.  We are crushed that Mr. Miyazakisan is retiring.  However, the movie really explains his decision, though this was NOT the focus of the movie.  We loved seeing the workshop where the magic we love so much was made.  Literally, his movies changed our lives.  My daughters began watching when oldest (now 24) was a Kindergartener.  My youngest, now 17, found her passion and life's calling through these passionate creations.  At 8 she was showing me details and the intricacies of the films and how they differed from ANYTHING else produced.  Her dream was to intern at Studio Ghibli, which can no longer be. Back to the movie...We liked seeing the interactions between the main players at Studio Ghibli, learning it's history, watching the humanness, affection, sometimes frustrations and angers that played out.  Enjoyed all the little details.  So very glad we bought and didn't rent!",1426377600,3,987,5.144654088050315

From 11 AM - 9 PM, Miyazaki works non-stop create his animated crafts. If you've liked any of Miyazaki's films, I'm sure you'll enjoy this documentary as much as I did.

6751327,5,B00OHLR4JS,"This film is beyond my expectation.

The key of a documentary film is how much an interviewer can make an interviewee expose oneself and talk about one's mind. Like many of cheap TV shows, to inquire the direct, sometimes even rude, questions is not the only way to do so. The interviewer, the female directer of this film, can successfully elicit thought-provoking conversations from valuable creators.

Ultimately, ""their daily lives"" seem to underlie the creation of numerous magnificent films. Those are atmosphere, habits, conversation, human relations, whatever in their everyday lives. Throughout this film, anyway, I can feel their fun. Since somebody describes their studio as ""a school"", such attitudes to enjoy daily life, not paradoxically, have led to the production of masterpieces.

Not only the making of ""The Wind Rises"", but also we can know the production story about their previous works. This film also explains the origin and history of the studio Ghibli neither too much nor too little. With well-written narrative historical backgrounds, we can naturally learn the message by legends, to speak plainly, ""life is the connection with others"".

The symbolic scene is the chat between Miyazaki and the director while seeing outside the window. It is well described that the source of outstanding creativity is to think differently always even when seeing the ordinary scenery.",1424044800,,1396,5.331818181818182

6751331,5,B00OHLR4JS,"HAYAO MIYAZAKI, 72 at filming, arrives at Studio Ghibli at 11 a.m. and works until 9 p.m. every day except Sunday.
""I don't take holidays or Saturdays off, only Sundays,"" he says in the documentary by Mami Sunada. ""And Sundays are very busy for me. Every Sunday morning, I go clean the river.""
That Miyazaki, gifted animator and story teller, is ecologically conscious comes as no surprise to his legion of fans. The preservation of nature dominates ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Princess Mononoke."" Lifelike characters, great storytelling, complex backgrounds and a near-magical rendering of nature's beauty from rolling cloudscapes to tiny insects perched on a flower are his hallmarks in films that also include steampunk fantasy ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and the Oscar-winning ""Spirited Away.""
There's nothing quite like Miyazaki.
Sunada's film takes us through a year of work preparing ""The Wind Rises,"" a 2014 Oscar-nominated animation about the life of Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed Japanese fighter planes during World War II. Also decidedly anti-war and anti-nuclear power, Miyazaki presents the story of a frustrated engineer; a boy who would realize his dream of designing planes only to have his gifts hijacked to create machines of war.
Born in Tokyo in 1941, Miyazaki has memories of the war and discusses some of his experiences. He tells us of a letter he received from a man who lived in his village and took refuge in his family's home. It took a long while before Miyazaki was able to respond, to thank the writer for sharing a good memory of a father long gone. Few of Miyazaki's war recollections fall in that category.
Sunada also follows the more elusive Isao Takahata, a fellow genius and past partner, as he creates the 2015 Oscar nominated animation, ""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya."" Takahata is known for ""Grave of the Fireflies."" He is notorious for missing deadlines, creating a world of anxiety for producers and studios as they wonder when - and if - he'll finish a project.
Producer Toshio Suzuki is also showcased, but, make no mistake, the film belongs to Miyazaki, who has become such a face in the business, fans come costumed as him at anime conventions. I don't believe Walt Disney or Pixar's John Lasseter has ever had that honor.
Lasseter makes an appearance in ""Ushiko Investigates!"", the informative and clever doc-within-a-doc included on the Blu-ray. Ushiko is the 10-year-old Japanese manx, a cat with a fluffy bob tail and serene disposition, who ""hangs out"" at Studio Ghibli. Beloved by all, she has a lovely bed, feeding area and is petted and groomed by staff, although legal informs us she doesn't actually ""live"" there. It's a Japanese thing.
But a point Ushiko questions as she takes us on a tour the day of Lasseter's visit. ""I watch `Totoro' and for me, the little boy comes out, and I want to be with Mei as she discovers the grotto where the big Totoro is sleeping. I want to be on his belly when he throws the top and flies. And I want to ride on the cat bus.""
Who doesn't?
The two initially met just after Miyazaki had finished his first animated film, ""The Castle of Cagliostro"" (1979). ""He came to Los Angeles with a group of Japanese animators to learn more about American animation,"" Lasseter says. Their next meeting was in 1987 when Lasseter made his first trip to Japan, and Miyazaki showed him the work on ""Totoro,"" including the cat bus. ""A bus that's a cat?"" Lasseter exclaims. ""Every single trip to Japan I've made, I come visit him. I've seen him during the making of many of his films, like `Spirited Away.'""
During one trip, he pulled discarded drawings - story boards - from Miyazaki's trashcan and asked if he could have them. They are framed in Lasseter's office.
Miyazaki doesn't write scripts; he creates story boards. Production begins before they are completed and no one - not even Miyazaki - knows how the story will end. ""I'm not working off any guidelines,"" he says. ""I honestly don't know what kind of film we'll end up with. This may sound ridiculous, but I've had staff tell me they have no idea what's going on in my films. When we were making `Spirited Away,' even I didn't know.""
Sunada's cinematography looks beautiful on the DVD, which looks as good as most Blu-rays I've seen. Colors are vivid and detail is sharp. Studio Ghibli, employing 400, is placed in as natural a setting as possible. The vine-covered building, exterior picnic table where Ushiko likes to sleep, and clean and modern interior decorated with film totems, are exquisitely captured even as we spot gigantic cell towers looming in the background. There's no escaping the ""dark side"" of the 21st century, as Miyazaki reminds us. Dialogue is in Japanese with subtitles against a score by Masakatsu Takagi (""Wolf Children""). A short-short extra, ""Digest Short Film,"" looks like deleted scenes edited together, further highlighting Ghibli's environment.
The year of ""The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness"" concludes with the premier of ""The Wind Rises"" and the news that ""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya"" has also been finished. At the press conference, Miyazaki - again - announces his retirement, even as he confesses, ""No one believes me anymore.""

6751333,5,B00OHLR4JS,This is a beautifully filmed look at the life of Hayao Miyazaki during the creation of one of his anime films. It is slow paced and the atmosphere is relaxed which I think fits the mood that most all Studio Ghibli films have to begin with. If you are a fan of Studio Ghibli or Hayao Miyazaki then you MUST see this! It's as close to spending time with the master filmmaker as the average person will get and it is very insightful to the process that happens at the studio to create a work of art and masterpiece film.,1421193600,,517,4.18
6751334,5,B00OHLR4JS,"Brilliant film about a brilliant group of animators in Japan.  The film centers around Miyazaki's last film before he retires.  It is inspiring, touching, and fun.  If you want to escape into the mind of a creative genius, this is a great film to do it.  He reminds us that life is not about making a lot of money or becoming famous, it is about doing what you love.  And, this man does!",1420675200,,387,4.2465753424657535
6751335,5,B00OHLR4JS,"Let me start of by saying that the intro to this documentary caught me by complete surprise. I felt like I was going into another ghibli film but then realized it wasn't an animation. The music was mellow and I felt completely at peace with myself. The Kingdom Of Dreams and Madness is a documentary film that aims to show the everyday life of famous artist Hayao Miyazaki and the notable animation studio, Studio Ghibli, where he works at. Miyazaki-San is recognized of being one of the greatest storytellers in animation history and Studio Ghibli can be compared to as the Japanese Pixar.

Going through this film, I learned about the life of Miyazaki-San and could not help but compare him to Japanese Sushi Master Jiro in the film ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"". Both Jiro-san and Miyazaki-san aim for perfection in their work. They are constantly trying to better themselves in their work as much as they can. Miyazaki-san has a very carefree work ethic often joking about and playing along with his coworkers but you can see that the man takes his work very seriously. He goes to every single event from the voice acting sessions to the creation of the music. This man is all over his film making sure everything goes to the way of how he imagined it.

I found a bit of magic in this wonderful man. He has a carefree nature and even acts like a father to his assistant. It was very nice to see their relationship play out along with Miyazaki-san's other coworkers. I also noticed that the man smokes A LOT. Every single slip of the film where Miyazaki is filmed, he is whiffing a cigarette but you can tell that the man despite his heavy cigarette use takes care of himself. He enjoys the little things like going up to the garden on top of the studio and just observing his surroundings. One thing I fully respected about him is the man's humility and wisdom. Everything that comes out of his mouth either has sheer wit or sounds like something out of Aristotle's list of great quotes. That's how amazing the man is.

I think any Studio Ghibli fan will have a good time seeing Miyazaki-san in action in this film. It was truly a worthwhile experience into the work life of one of the greatest storytellers in history.",1420416000,,2216,4.548872180451128
6751336,5,B00OHLR4JS,"This is a review for the Australian, Region 4, DVD Edition.

Its been a while since I saw a decent documentary about Ghibli Studios and there is only a few that have been subtitled in English, and even less when it comes to official releases.  The Japanese have been lucky to get 4 hour epics about Princess Mononoke, Ponyo, and more recently Princess Kaguya (A Making of has been released theatrically in a 90min edition which the U.S. will get in their BR edition of the film).  From Up on Poppy Hill also had a stand alone Documentary released on BR/DVD which looked delicious after seeing only a trailer where we see Miyazaki Sr. have a go at Miyazaki Jr.  What I wouldn't give for an English subtitled release!  And what do we in the English market get? A five minute interview with the English voice actors!  No, that's not entirely true but it feels like it.  We have been given a few bones here and there with some containing a bit of meat, but most of them are just long featurettes and not actual stand alone documentaries.  For those that are interested in seeing decent featurettes of note there is - Making of Spirited Away [42min] (Region 4 DVD), and the following had excellent special features (all are on Region B releases);
Nausica, Ponyo, Arrietty, Poppy Hill.  Anyway, back to why we are here.  The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness (TKoDaM) DVD.

In the English market there is only the DVD and if you want a BD they you have to get the Japanese edition.  It would have been nice to have it available on BD but I don't feel you miss out on anything.  One thing you might complain about is when they show scenes from Ghibli Movies in HD.  However, I watched the documentary in HD and half of the movie scenes were shown in standard definition.  Anyway, five minutes into the documentary you forget that it's in SD and get right into the film. .

Now, the first time I watched this I did not enjoy the experience.  I don't know whether it's because of the weather, the mood I was in, or the time of day.  In the following days something told me to give it another watch.  As of today I'm on my fourth viewing.  So if you didn't like it on your first watch then try and give it another go and you might feel differently towards it.

The documentary takes place during the making of THE WIND RISES, and it's not about ""how"" it got made but what happens around the studio at the time.  The film revolves around Miyazaki but you do get to see a few supporting players such as Takahata and Suzuki.  Everybody is very honest and open about how each of them feels towards each other especially Miyazaki towards Takahata.  It might seem that he is negative towards Takahata when he says that once upon a time Takahata had a passion towards film making, but if you listen carefully he also is referring to himself as well.

And then there is Ushiko, who also gets an interesting featurette.  Actually, here you get to see how the film got made at least on a more technical side.

If you are a Ghibli Studio fan then this is an obvious purchase, and who knows the masters in Japan might see that there is a great interest for these documentaries and maybe they'll release more English friendly documentary releases.  We can dream.",1420329600,2,3235,4.428087986463621

For a foreign documentary, it is very relaxing to watch, as there are many lingering shots of the art and scenery and the Studio's cat. This is also a great source for material if you have to write a paper on the studio or Miyazaki (I saw this documentary when it was on Netflix but bought it later when I chose to write about him). For example, it covers how Miyazaki works, his work ethic and standards, his personal history, how he plans his movies and how he is involved in nearly all parts of production, his team and their responsibilities, how his employees see him etc etc etc. I highly recommend this for anyone from casual fan to animatophile (yeah I made that up but it should be a real term). 10/10",1502150400,,865,4.37888198757764
