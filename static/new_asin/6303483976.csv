7848577,3,6303483976,"The Kalacharkra is a Peace Mandala and sacred symbol for Buddhists, especially in Tibet. It is said to be 2,600 years old and to have originated with the Buddha himself. This video shows the how four Tibetan Buddhist monks build the intricate symbol out of sand in Dublin, Ireland.  They worked for eight hours a day for three weeks to create it only to  ritualistically dismantle it during a study on impermanence. Though I very  much enjoyed watching the way the monks built the mandala in such a  meditative and dedicated way, I would have preferred more in depth  understanding of meaning of some of the symbolism. Some mention was made of  key elements making this a good video for the curious and the beginner, but  I would enjoyed more. This is especially true since I was surprised to find  out when I got the video it was only 30 minutes long!",962150400,6,852,4.559210526315789
