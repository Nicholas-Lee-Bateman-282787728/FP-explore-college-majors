4844589,3,B005N8KPBI,Pretty typical Nick Cage flick.  Lots of action with a fairly predictable plot.  Guy Pearce plays a pretty good role and JJ is easy on the eyes.,1340323200,,144,4.296296296296297
4844590,2,B005N8KPBI,"About two thirds through this movie I completely forgot what the plot was. Somewhere when Cage is driving around Louisiana having long-winded conversations with convenience store attendants. But, it's okay because the plot is the least of this movies problems. Your suspension of disbelief is going to be working overtime. Asking yourself such questions as, ""Why is smoking hot January Jones married to a 55 year old high school English teacher?"" and ""Why does a middle aged childless couple have alphabet kitchen magnets on their fridge?"" These and other intriguing questions are waiting to be explored in this B-movie laugh fest. I don't know how much positive impact this movie will have on New Orleans tourism; my biggest take-away is that they have a lot of freeways with extremely dangerous pedestrian overpasses. On the bright side I always enjoy seeing Guy Pearce. Not a horrendous movie, just unnecessary, but good for a laugh. Whether you're chuckling at January Jones' wooden acting, or the movie's pinnacle scene at a Superdome held monster truck rally; you're sure to have two hours unbridled entertainment.",1340236800,,1120,5.193370165745856
4844591,5,B005N8KPBI,Nick Cage is back! This movie was one of the best I have seen in a long time. Many unexpected twists and turns.,1340064000,,111,3.869565217391304
4844592,5,B005N8KPBI,"The wife of a high-school teacher is the victim of a brutal rape, which takes her a long time to recover. Six months after the horrifying incident, she is still suffering, especially mentally. Nicolas Cage is her husband, who receives an offer from a stranger to make the rapist pay for what he did in exchange for Nicolas to kill a child pornographer. This is a fast-paced action thriller, which reminds us of ""DEATH WISH"" as Cage is requested to later on act as Vigilante. Acting performance is Superb, with intense suspense throughout. Entertaining and Chilling. Highly recommended to all thriller lovers, who enjoy high-speed action, combined with suspense that explodes off the screen!",1339891200,2,690,5.06140350877193
4844593,4,B005N8KPBI,"Shot in New Orleans, SEEKING JUSTICE is an entertaining action-thriller that evokes memories of THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and other classic films of that conspiracy genre.

Nicolas Cage, in an unusually well moderated, low-key performance, plays a happily married high school teacher whose wife (January Jones) becomes the victim of a brutal rape.  While waiting in the hospital, he is approached by a concerned stranger (Guy Pearce) who offers to get justice for his wife in exchange for a favor, sometime in the future.  Distraught, Cage agrees to the vigilante course of action and, within hours, word comes that the rapist has ""committed suicide"".

Six months later, Jones has recovered from her physical injuries, yet is still on edge from her horrific experience, when Cage is summoned by Pearce to return the ""favor"" by killing an alleged child pornographer.  And, if he doesn't do it, there will be dire consequences.

There are a few surprising plot twists in this fast-moving film, which is actually a lot better than I expected.  True, there are moments where your believability quotient may be slightly strained, but with these kinds of movies, you either go along with them or you don't, and in the case of this Roger Donaldson-directed thriller, the tendency is to just enjoy the ride.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette.

4844594,4,B005N8KPBI,"""I represent an organization that deals with people like the man who raped your wife and we would very much like to take care of him for you."" On her way home one night Laura (Jones) is violently attacked and raped. While visiting her in the hospital her husband Will (Cage) is approached by a stranger who has an offer for him. Will agrees but soon regrets his decision as it begins to take a serious toll on his and Laura's life. I don't think it comes as a surprise to anyone anymore that I am not a Nicholas Cage fan at all. I have liked a handful of the movies he has been in but not because of him. This is a movie I can add to that list. Cage is a little over the top in a few scenes, but overall this is a very entertaining movie that I really liked. I tend to like the vigilante type movies and this has that aspect to it. The cast is really good in this (Cage was...Cage) and it kept you guessing and entertained the whole time. Overall, for a non-Cage fan this is one that I would recommend. I liked it. I give it a B+.",1336089600,24,1030,3.9806763285024154
4844595,2,B005N8KPBI,"Three months into 2012 and we've already been blessed with two movies starring Nicolas Cage. His return to New Orleans should have been spectacular and something borderline epic since Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans featured Cage at his craziest yet was able to showcase that in this bizarre and intriguing way. Despite most critics and people in general downright hating Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, everyone should be able to agree that it was not only a higher production but a better movie overall in comparison to Seeking Justice.

Seeking Justice is kind of like combining The Adjustment Bureau and any Steven Segal movie that wasn't released in theaters with a third of its budget and none of its creativity. For Nicolas Cage, it seems like it's just another absurd role amongst a stack of low grade movies that'd make B-movies blush, but it feels like an odd choice for Guy Pearce. Cage has had this cheese factor to him for years now. Most people can't even look at him without automatically thinking of him punching old women in the face, dressing up in a bear costume, getting bees shoved in every orifice in his face, or some other ridiculous moment from The Wicker Man. Pearce has made a name for himself in small supporting roles lately; The Road, The Hurt Locker, and Animal Kingdom are a few examples. Pearce usually picks some pretty fantastic projects to be a part of and while Simon is similar to Roy Clayton from Traitor and Pearce is able to slide into Simon's shoes with ease, but Seeking Justice feels ridiculously cheap without much of a payoff.

Nicolas Cage isn't his out of control, fly-off-the-handle-at-a-moment's-notice self here. He's calm and more collected, at least until his wife Laura (played by January Jones) is beaten to a bloody pulp. Then Cage is noticeably upset. It doesn't seem to be just because his wife was almost killed. Cage seems legitimately irritated and frustrated; almost as if he doesn't want to be there. If Nicolas Cage doesn't want to stick around of whatever terrible movie he's chosen to be a part of, then buckle up because you're in for a special treat.

But as always you can count on Cage for some downright ridiculousness and illogical nonsense the likes of which have been seen before but can't be found anywhere else but in a Nicolas Cage movie. That weird candy machine staredown that makes things even more suspicious and awkward and feels like it lasts for an eternity is a great place to start. Just because it's called ""The Forever bar"" and looks like it was stolen out of Willy Wonka's factory doesn't mean it should actually last forever. The prime example though is when Cage walks into a fancy hotel completely underdressed. He's a wanted man at this point; his face plastered all over the city. To look less conspicuous Cage puts a nicer jacket OVER his existing one then walks around in a relieved state as if he just pulled a Houdini on all of New Orleans. Throw in his weird old man shuffle that's essentially jiggling while power walking as the camera bounces around to make it look like he's running faster than he is and you have a trifecta of what in the blue hell is going on here?

The only thing Seeking Justice accomplishes is make you feel jealous over the fact that Nicolas Cage was never your teacher while you were in school talking about punching somebody in the face (before physically doing so). Seeking Justice looks and feels like a direct to video release. Its camera work feels like a small step up from underground pornography and Nicolas Cage and his quirky shenanigans are the best part of the movie as you'll be laughing like crazy because it's so bad. This secret organization is like a less entertaining version of the Stonecutters from ""The Simpsons."" Seeking Justice is just a poor excuse of a theatrically released movie that will leave you laughing in disbelief for ever sitting down to see it in the first place.",1332028800,3,3938,4.719476744186046

The story has some originality to it, and the action is not so over-the-top that it just seems silly like so many action movies tend to do.  Guy Pearce is really creepy in this one.  He makes a great antagonist for Cage, and while you think you know where the movie is probably going to take you, it does still make you pay attention, and maybe even ask yourself, ""what would I do in this situation?"".",1468627200,,502,4.154639175257732

4844619,5,B005N8KPBI,"This is one of the most entertaining films I have seen, in fact I don't know why it has taken so long to review it. ""Seeking Justice"" is about a man who's wife has been raped. While at the hospital a man named Simon comes to him and offers his company's services. You see these people deal with people like the man who beat and raped his wife. If you say yes then you owe them a favor at some point when they need one. At first Will turns him down but once the police investigation is going no where he agrees.

This sets off one of the best films I have watched especially as far thrillers go. I love the story here as things go from bad to worse for Will as the favor called in is one that may be just as bad or worse than the one he received. Cage is great here as Will and you can really feel his struggle and pain when dealing with all these different and horrible situations. Now while everyone in this film is excellent as the acting is top notch I have to say that Guy Pearce may be the MVP here. He plays Simon wonderfully and may be the scene stealer in a film that has great acting in every role.

Now sure this isn't a perfect film and there are moments that you may question but if you just let your mind relax than this can be an engaging film with some pretty good twists. The film was written by Todd Hickey and Robert Tannen and thought they did a great job along side Director Roger Donaldson who has directed films like ""Species"", ""Dante's Peak"", ""The Bank Job"" among others. I thought this was a really great film and watching it again recently sparked this review.",1410220800,,1585,4.142857142857143

4844633,1,B005N8KPBI,"First of all, to everyone writing that this movie is ""unpredictable"" and ""for individuals who like watching movies where they can't figure out things until the end"" - what the heck did you watch? Because this movie was full of tired cliches and incredibly predictable. If you couldn't figure out what was going to happen, I just... I don't understand that.

Let me tell you, I'm not ashamed to say I love Nicholas Cage movies. Most of the time. Even the ones that are so bad they're good - they're usually good, fun, action movies. And if you're looking at this movie, that's probably what you're looking for (or you're lost). You won't get it here.

This movie was so boring, and so lame. January Jones is cute as a button but can't act her way out of a bag, and this seems to rub off on Cage - he's usually a lot better (but trust me, his acting was still good and the best part of the movie).

It was just a bad script and bad direction, with some bad acting thrown in. A really bad script. Please don't waste your time or money. If you absolutely feel compelled to watch it, find it on HBO one day, and then you'll remember that I was right and tried to save you that anguish",1369353600,,1179,4.254464285714286
4844634,5,B005N8KPBI,"Borrowed a friends copy of this program, all five episodes, and enjoyed all of them. Changes are being made in the judicial system which a lot of people within the system do not like. The hero is something of a mystery, 40 years prior he grew up in the area he is now to provide justice for, he left under suspicous circumstances, some people remember him but most don't. Most of his cases are not of earth shattering importance, a once beautiful little park has become a dump site, what to do about an individual that is constantly being arrested for soliciting prostitutes in the same area, a petty crime boss ruining a once close knit family neighborhood, a young kid that needs to see what justice is really about.

4844636,4,B005N8KPBI,"Roger Donaldson's ""Seeking Justice"" didn't receive a lot of attention- from the media or audiences- when it was released in theaters not too long ago, but it's worth a look at home via disc, download, or streaming (so many options these days).  The film reminded me a lot of Mr. Donaldson's old thriller with Kevin Costner, ""No Way Out"".  Like that earlier film, there's lots of tension and action, but all laced with an uncomfortable (and involving) paranoia as both audience members and the center-stage characters constantly wonder who is in on the big conspiracy.

The story in ""Seeking Justice"" involves a vigilante group that offers, well... justice to the Nicholas Cage character and his wife (played by January Jones) after the wife is brutally attacked by some weirdo creep.  Though it rubs him the wrong way, the husband eventually takes the deal, but soon finds out that there's no free lunch.  You see, Cage is all too quickly asked to return the favor and help the vigilante group exact vengeance against some other thug who supposedly did something horrible, this time to a little kid.  The ""supposedly"" is what complicates the film, demonstrating that vigilante justice maybe isn't the simple, satisfying thing many believe it is.

In the end, this was a solid, well-crafted thriller about a topic- taking the law into one's own hands- that is usually relegated to exploitation films and other ""crowd pleaser"" type movies (the Neil Jordan/Jodie Foster movie ""The Brave One"" is the only other modern, A-list movie that comes to mind that tackled the subject, and that did a decent job, too).  Anyway, a well-told, intelligent story and complex, understated performances by Nicholas Cage and his co-stars easily make ""Seeking Justice"" a good choice for home viewing.",1368144000,,1779,5.0272108843537415

4844642,4,B005N8KPBI,"Don't believe that a great cast, a clever director, and some stylish editing can overcome a problematic script?  Then check out ""Seeking Justice"" and see for yourself!

Nicolas Cage plays Will Gerard, a high school English teacher in New Orleans who's an easy-going intellectual type ... until his wife Laura (January Jones) is brutally beaten and raped.  Overwhelmed and dazed, confused and outraged, Will is approached in the hospital waiting room by a mysterious man named Simon (Guy Pearce), who just happens to know the identity of Laura's attacker.  Simon offers Will some immediate vigilante-style justice - IF Will agrees to perform a service for his organization sometime in the future.  Hesitantly, Will accepts.  Flash forward to six months later: Simon returns to collect payment on Will's debt, and the hapless teacher quickly learns that he has made a deal with the devil himself.  What follows are a series of hair-raising, adrenaline-pumping onscreen chases, escapes, murders, betrayals, and kidnappings that finally culminate in a heart-pounding showdown ... and a twist ending.

Cage gives an energetic, magnetic performance as Will; his somewhat quirky onscreen persona is perfect for this role.  No other actor is more adept than he at credibly shifting from laid-back passivity to manic hyperactivity.  His intensity is matched by that of Guy Pearce as Simon, who starts off being suave and smooth, but increasingly loses his cool as control of Will slips through his fingers.  January Jones is excellent as Will's wife, a victim who reclaims control of her life, and superb work is also turned in by Harold Perrineau as Will's best friend and Xander Berkeley as a savvy police lieutenant.  Among the cast, only Jennifer Carpenter seems wasted; she has relatively little screen time, and not much to do.

All in all, ""Seeking Justice"" is worth a look, perfect for one of those nights you want to curl up with a bowl of popcorn and be entertained.  Director Roger Donaldson and film editor Jay Cassidy keep things moving right along; through the opening credits to the final fadeout, there's not a wasted frame of film.

4844643,4,B005N8KPBI,"Seeking Justice is a rare example of a B-Movie blockbuster. This film may have been direct-to-video, but it features one hell of a cast, a ton of action, and a pretty decent storyline. Like most B-movies, this film was predictable as hell, but not in a bad way. Yes, I knew what was coming, but I was still interested in seeing how it was done and what the results would be. Nicholas Cage is actual not the action star of this film, he is merely a High School English Teacher, with a seemingly perfect life. His world gets turned around though when his wife is savagely raped and beaten. As a result, Cage has two options, let the police do their thing or find someone else to take care of business. Can you guess which choice he made? Cage is of course fantastic as always. Even if the particular film doesn't suit your interests, when you see that it stars Nicholas Cage, you know you're about to be entertained. Guy Pierce is also excellent, giving a performance that was eerily similar to that of his character in Memento.

4844644,4,B005N8KPBI,"Seeking Justice(released Sept/11)stars,among others,Nicolas Cage as Will Gerard,January Jones as Laura Gerard,Guy Pearce as Simon/Eugene Cook and Harold Perrineau as Jimmy. This is,I think,a well thought out melodrama and it plays very well. The direction seemed good as did the writing. The nemesis/nemeses in this play are members of the Edmund Burke Society. It's not too often that modern day followers of this 18th century Irish philosopher,extreme right wingers now and founded at the U of Toronto in the late 60s,get an airing.
The story comes out of the Big Easy. As it opens we are privy to a recording of someone giving someone,off camera,some seemingly vital information. When that person leaves the room his car is attacked and pushed from one level of a parking lot to one below. The scene switches to Cage and his wife who are celebrating their anniversary. He is a teacher and she a musician. The next night while awaiting his wife to get out of rehearsal at his local,and playing chess with his friend,his wife is brutally raped and beaten. Cage arrives later at the hospital and is beside himself with grief. A man sidles up to him and tells him that he and the organization he works for can take care of this guy,for they know exactly who and where he is. Cage asks what the catch is,and all the man will say is just for a future favour or two. Cage does some soul searching at this vulnerable moment and finally agrees.
The hit goes down and Cage is delivered the photo of the dead man along with his wife's stolen neck chain. Life tries to get back to normal,but his wife is still traumatized and it is obvious she will be for some time to come. One day he gets approached by the man who did the dirty for him and asks him to mail a letter at a certain time in front of the zoo. Just as he is about to mail it he gets a call ad is told to open it up. Inside are pictures of a woman and two children,along with a man. He is told to go into the zoo,watch the woman and children and to call him if the man should show up,using the call words""the rabbit jumped"".The man never appears and Cage leaves the zoo. He figures he is done but it is not to be. His contact tells him the man is a pedophile and that they want him to kill him at a certain transit overpass at a certain time of the day. Cage balks at every stage but the pressure is too much,and his wife can see the tension growing.
With tires slashed Cage is forced to take a certain bus to the pre-arranged area and get off and wait for the perp. That day he cannot do it and continues on to work. Of course he is followed and contacted again and the next day it starts all over again. This time Cage does get off the bus and waits for the following bus to disgorge the perp in question. Cage waits on the walkway and as the man approaches he calls out his name to talk but the man starts tussling with him instead. The man ends up falling to his death onto a car on the freeway below. Cage flees.
Back home Cage's wife has found her neck chain Cage left in his glove compartment and asks for an explanation,which he cannot give. She storms out. A knock soon comes on the door and it is the police;he is busted for the murder of the man on the overpass,whose name differs from the name he was given by his contact. At the station the cops have only partial security footage of Cage leaving the area,not on the actual ramp,which his contact said they would take care of. The two cops grilling him are getting nowhere and a lieutenant comes in alone to speak to him. He pry's the password""the rabbit jumped"" out of Cage,and the lieutenant,in on this secret organization also,lets him go free. His freedom however is not official,and the two cops who arrested him put out a warrant for him.
Now out and on the run,Cage makes contact with his wife briefly,who is now more informed as to Cage's predicament. Cage starts digging into the identity of the man he tussled with and finds his real name and his occupation:an investigative journalist. He goes to the newspaper he worked for and even goes to his wake,held in an Irish pub. His trail leads him to the dead man's storage locker,where he finds a box with the recording we saw at the beginning of the film,inside it. It now shows he was investigating this secret organization for a story,and the man who was killed after the recording was done,was an insider. Cage also finds the man's phone,which has video of Cage at the zoo. Cage phones his original contact and tells him to meet him at a sports game. There,with the evidence against them,he wants them to leave he and wife alone. But they have since,abducted Cage's wife and have her held in an abandoned mall beside the stadium. This is where the climax will play out as one of Cage's best friends is found out to be a member also. When they threaten to kill Cage and his wife his friend steps in to derail their plans. A shootout occurs with Cage and his wife barely making it out alive. And who should be the investigating officer on the scene,but the police lieutenant. He tells them that they're both free and offers Cage a chance to join them,which he of course declines. The film ends as Cage hands over what evidence he has from the reporters files to his newspaper. The man who takes it and walks away,makes a quick reference back to Cage with""the rabbit jumps"".
The film,as you can see,has a lot of twists and turns and many surprises as to who or who doesn't belong to this secret society. It actually is only secret insofar as the general public's knowledge of their existence and activities. Early on his contact explains that""the rabbit jumped"" is a reference to a quote from their philosophical leader Edmund Burke. Cage's first meeting with his contact is pivotal in the film. It it his speech to Cage about the justice system and its inequities that finally prompt Cage to finally go along with him. It is also that dialogue that makes or breaks the rest of the movie,for if we do not believe as Cage did,then the rest of the film would have been a sham. But it has just enough truths and half truths in it that we do...at least I did. The acting is all top notch and Cage brings it to this film.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a nicely done melodrama with an Edmund Burke philosophical twist in it. Well directed and written. Recommended. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1361491200,,6432,4.396812080536913

4844663,4,B005N8KPBI,"This thriller is nothing groundbreaking, but it does a surprisingly good job working through theoretical implications of private citizens setting up a vigilante justice system.  Nicolas Cage (an actor whose movies I generally avoid at every possible opportunity) and January Jones play a married couple, and their marriage is strained after a violent sexual assault by a stranger.  When Guy Pearce appears to Cage in a hospital waiting area and talks him through the unsatisfactory outcomes of letting the law handle the situation, Cage agrees to Pearce's offer to handle everything more directly.  From there, the story spins out in ways that should remind viewers of the classic Twilight Zone episode about pushing the button, and while there are not many huge surprises, there are plenty of moral quandaries, car crashes, and power shifts.  Cage actually does a pretty good job as the lead (aside from an embarrassing early scene where he tries to teach a high school class by asking good questions but always answering them without giving students an opportunity to engage - but the blame for that scene should probably go more to the writing than the acting), running and shooting and hiding and looking scared.

A nice aspect of this movie that I hadn't expected is the way that it celebrates post-Katrina New Orleans.  Most of the major characters don't attempt Cajun accents, which is fine for a city where people move in from elsewhere, but the minor characters sound local (including, at a level that really impressed this former resident of the Gulf Coast, Xander Berkeley).  Scenes take place in the Superdome, in a public high school, and in a shopping mall abandoned after the hurricane.  Characters with different backgrounds exemplify the multicultural nature of the city in a way that feels natural.  Basically, the city adds a character that makes this movie stand out a bit from similar thrillers set in the more predictable locations of NYC or LA.

This movie probably won't become your new favorite or change your life, but it's a very well-done moral thriller with surprisingly good performances and a fascinating setting.  I recommend checking this one out.",1358726400,,2180,5.06145251396648

4844684,4,B005N8KPBI,"First off, let me confess that I enjoy almost every movie Nicolas Cage has made.  That said, I found the ""chain letter"" approach to revenge (aka, justice) very intriguing and thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie.  When I say ""chain letter"" revenge, I am saying that one person, in this case Will Gerard (Nicolas Cage), ""receives"" an offer (chain letter) to have his wife's rapist, Hodge (Alex Van), killed (the promise of a chain letter) in exchange for some future request (forwarding the chain letter).  Will thus gets an offer/letter from Simon (Guy Pearce), who approaches Will in the hospital allegedly representing an organization of concerned citizens--other letter receivers/senders seeking justice/the promise of a chain letter--who will kill Hodge (the ""carrot"" of a chain letter).  All Will has to do is agree to do the organization a favor/sending the chain letter to others some time in the future.  Not thinking clearly, Will agrees to the terms (a future promise/sending the letter to others) fearful that the habitual criminal, Hodge, will yet again be set free by the justice system.  Six months later, Will is contacted by the organization/Simon for a favor/sending out letters.  The favor/forwarding the chain letter: ""accidentally"" bumping someone over a railing into auto traffic (i.e., killing the man).  The rest of the story is about Will's actions and the consequences of Will's agreement/forwarding the favor of getting revenge.

I easily found myself asking what would I do.  From the prospective of my own life, where the so called justice system is apathetic or invisible, I have on occasion thought that revenge would be sweet.  But, as the story demonstrates, all actions come with a price--all be it, usually one that we willingly pay under ""normal"" circumstances.  SEEKING JUSTICE is great action combined with ethical dilemmas, and I highly recommend the film to others.  The movie is certainly one I will watch more than once.  And if you are a Nicolas Cage fan, this is a must watch movie (Guy Pearce and January Jones (star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-s-Enduring-Promise/dp/B0006IUDC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love's Enduring Promise</a>) play out their rolls with believability).

Though the help he offers is free of charge, the stranger makes it clear that he may call on Will to repay the favor sometime in the future. When that day comes and Will realizes the true price of revenge is too high for him to pay, the men who once agreed to help him suddenly become his worst enemies.

4844708,3,B005N8KPBI,"When it comes to NC films I always seem to either love them or hate them.

This falls in the middle.

Very interesting 'plot' for sure but it sure had alot of holes in it. Spoilers - Obviously we find out this 'organization', which at the beginning we are led to believe is very small with only very few people involved. Later, we find out the 'organization' is rather huge including police officers, reporters, NC's own co-workers & the list goes on and on.

With such a large organization with so many involved including those (police, reporters etc) who could 'do the job easily', it makes no sense that for 'every kill', they then 'tap that victims family member' to do the 'next kill'.

These are just normal people & most simply would not carry out the 'next kill', regardless of 'the favor they owe'. It would all blow up in a hurry as this 'secret & small organization' filled with a 'few select people ready & willing to do the jobs while keeping everything quiet' is actually a huge organization filled with normal people that would ensure it certainly is not quiet.

With so many normal, non killers 'doing the jobs' or 'being asked/threatened to', this would not last a month, even with police officers involved to 'help keep it quiet', let alone 10 or more years.

No way could they do it as they do & have it last that long. It wouldnt take the 'journalist' or anybody else 10 or more years 'to put the pieces together'...it would take a month before these 'normal people let the cat out of the bag'

So, it really made no sense why they had the number of people involved with many 'skilled in killing'..'100% for the cause' & 'dedicated to keeping it quiet', but they then use tons of normal people 'unskilled in killin', 'not dedicated to the cause' & certainly 'not dedicated to keeping things quiet'..in fact, these 'normal people would ensure its anything but quiet/a secret.....

But hey, its a movie so no biggie 'it doesnt make logical sense'.

But even tho, the movie still seemed rather predictable with it being fairly obvious at the beginning that the 'favor they will ask NC for', is going to be to kill someone.

It was also fairly obvious that we would find out there was alot more people involved then 'just a few dedicated citizens' as well as knowing we would find out 'a person/people' close to NC that he knows well, were involved as well & involved in helping to 'screw NC'.

But hey, the acting was decent, the plot interesting so was worth watching, but not a movie i'll watch more then once.

4844712,3,B005N8KPBI,"Seeking Justice with Nicholas Cage and January Jones is purported to be a conspiracy story where a couple stumbles upon an organization that uses people as patsies to systematically kill those that it deems are ruining the city.  The person helping, who gets revenge for their own suffering (in Nick Cage's case, the rapist of his wife gets bumped off) in exchange for a minor favor, which usually involves murder.

When Nick's character resists this, (being told that he would kill a child pornographer - in reality an investigative reporter who is getting too close to the truth) he his hounded by the organization.

Plot-Holes!

I understood that this organization has infiltrated much more than originally thought, and Nick's acting is pretty spot on, if a bit sympathetic but there are many questions left - why does he go into a hotel and manage to steal a car?  And if he really needed wheels that badly, then why did he not later return the car?  And why were the cops not after him on this?

He does not tell his wife any of his dealings until near the end of the movie.  She later becomes a key player, but a bit late in the film.

If this organization is so secretive, why does it not just pull its own jobs rather than convince patsies?  Would it not be faster to hire a hit man?

Bottom Line:  I got this DVD for free and that's a pretty good deal.  Why spend dough on a story that makes little sense and delivers an unsatisfying ending?  The story revolves around things are not as they seem - and it pretty much ends that way too.  Very unsatisfying.

In Seeking Justice, Cage gives one of his better performances, as well as similar excellence by all the other actors. The plot moves along with great tension and action. The only negative here is the highly predictable and worn out concept of the secret underground group that takes justice into its own hands and suffers from its own corruption, resulting in serious threats to Cage and his wife.

4844716,2,B005N8KPBI,"I was excited to get this movie because I love Guy Pearce (even if he is the villian) and I love Nicholas Cage. However, the plot seems to be somewhat lacking. If you have ever seen an action movie WITHOUT explosions or any sort of mafia movie, you had already seen this movie, in a sense. The story is of a man (Nick Cage) whose wife is raped. While he is sitting in a waiting room at the hospital, a man (Pearce) approaches him about a transaction to ""take care of"" the rapist and all Cage has to do in the future is repay them with some small favor (as Pearce tells him ""a phone call here"" and other various trivial things).  Pearce tells Cage that he is part of a vigilante organization who basically dispatches people who have fallen through the justice system cracks and have no business being on the street. Since the process seems easy enough so Cage agrees (somewhat reluctantly).

Of course, we know Mr. Pearce was lying about the minimalism to which Cage would be involved. It starts out with mailing a letter, then following a woman and her two daughters before he is finally set up for murder by this charming organization. I will spare the ending (which is utterly predictable) so you have some surprise left but this movie does not live up to its potential. The suspense parts of the movie actually have more of a hurry up and wait quality to them. For example, in the beginning we see Cage's wife, played by January Jones, leaving her rehearsal (she is a musician) in the dark, ALONE, walking down a dimly lit walkway. Cage's character is across town playing chess with a friend and they make a point of showing his cellphone being turned off before the game.

I didn't know who Keyser Soze was until the very end, and I had no idea Bruce Willis was a ghost. Movies are made for people like me. And I like cheap thrillers that are full of action and witty banter. I like Nick Cage despite his somewhat frequent bomb movie choice. And this movie was no exception.

Nick Cage plays a man whose wife is brutally raped and beaten and is given the opportunity to avenge her attack. He can do so by accepting a favor to be specified at a later date. In his grief, he agrees to the arrangement, but when it comes time to pay up, he isn't so sure about what he has entered into. By then, his conscience is too late and he finds himself inside a corrupt vigilante system that goes deeper than even he can imagine. Is justice still justice when it is achieved through the scariest and most criminal of ways?

Thats how he hooks all grieving spouses. Its this group of once traumatized men who are then asked to murder someone else who commited a simular crime. it just goes on and on. Like the movie the box, press the button you can have a million dollars, but you have to murder your wife or husband to get it. Messed up moral deliema that proves what kind of person you are.

""Seeking Justice"" (105 min.) starts off with Nicolas Cage and January Jones as the super-happy married couple, when at some point Jones is brutally attacked. In the hospital Cage is offered a proposition by Pearce ""to take care of this"" (meaning the attacker), in return for some unspecified favor in the future. Cage agrees, and the attacker is murdered. This covers the first 25 min. of the movie, and I really had to struggle to keep my attention. But then a funny thing happens: the ""unspecified favor in return"" becomes a messy situation for Cage, which at first he complies with, but then gets more and more complex and overwhelms Cage. It is the middle part of the movie that really caught my attention, as we're not really sure what exactly is going on or what is going to happen next. The latter part of movie reveals all.

To be honest, I had low expectations going into this, and I ended up enjoying this more than I expected. At times, though, the acting leaves to be desired. But there are some great action scenes, and for the while that the movie kept me guessing, I really liked it. Not the best of movies, but certainly not the worst either.",1342656000,,1391,4.4940711462450595

It is good to see Cage getting his feet back under him and this is the right kind of project for that.  The earnest quality of the DEATH WISH/BOX screenplay is mostly played for entertainment value and the editing and pacing help keep this movie ticking until the tense finale.  Guy Pearce has strong presence here, and January Jones and Cage actually have a certain chemistry in some of the early scenes.  Sometimes it takes me two sittings to get through a DVD, this one ran from credits to credits as it is easy to get caught up in the story.  Well made, paced, and thought out.",1342656000,,669,4.450819672131147
4844725,3,B005N8KPBI,"Nicolas Cage has made some great movies and some bad. The sad truth is that lately he's made more mediocre films than ever. Perhaps that's because he's been making them at such a frantic pace or at least it seems that way. In any event his latest thriller SEEKING JUSTICE offers a decent night's entertainment but still finds itself in that so so stack of Cage films.

In the film Cage plays Will Gerard, an English teacher in an inner city school who is married to Laura (January Jones), a cellist with the local symphony. One night after practice while Will is playing chess with his best friend Jimmy (Harold Perrineau), Laura is attacked and raped when she gets to her car.

Sitting in the hospital waiting room filled with dread and despair over the event Will is approached by a man sitting nearby. Introducing himself as Simon (Guy Pearce) he tells Will that this is not the first time this man has raped someone. He has the man's picture and shows him to Will. Then he offers him a chance for justice. He tells Will he might ask him for a favor in the future, no questions asked. In return, Simon and a group of like minded individuals will take care of the rapist. All he has to do is give them a predetermined sign.

Will makes the choice and gives the sign. Several days later he is given a picture of the rapist who was shot and killed that night. The months go on and Will and Laura move forward. Then one day Simon shows up and asks Will if he's ready to repay his debt. When he thinks it involves his killing someone else, Will reneges on the deal. But Simon forces his hand and lets Will know he's willing to put Laura in danger if he doesn't go along.

Will agrees and is instructed to meet a man they identify as a child molester on an overpass near the highway. Unable to bring himself to kill the man he tries to talk to him but the man attempts to fight Will and accidentally falls onto the street below to his death. While it appears Will has honored the contract, he later finds the police looking for him to arrest him for the murder. It turns out the man wasn't a molester at all but a new reporter.

Avoiding the police and digging deeper, Will finds out the man knew something about the group that Simon is in charge of. On the run and trying to find a way out, Will follows the clues as to who this group is and how high up they go. With helps along the way, he tries to find a way out of the predicament he's gotten himself into.

The movie offers a decent mystery here and a chase that last long enough and not too long to keep the action moving forward. The cast is excellent with the exception of Cage I'm sorry to say. Cage just doesn't feel like the meek type, the milk toast who finds it in himself to take on this group. It's not that his acting is bad but the casting of Cage in this role leaves a lot to be desired.

As with any good thriller there are plenty of plot twists going on here. Some you may see coming while others will catch you off guard. All in all it's an entertaining film that will keep you guessing. It may not be Cage's best film but is by far not his worst.",1342569600,,3116,4.191986644407345

However, I find Guy Pearce an interesting and diverse actor, so I gave the movie a chance.  I actually enjoyed SEEKING JUSTICE---it's an engrossing, suspenseful thriller well directed by Roger Donaldson.  It has some clever twists and a satisfying, although surprising, ending.  Cage doesn't irritate me as bad as usual and Pearce gives an understated, yet creepily effective performance.  I've also never been too impressed with January Jones who seems restrained in her performance.  I can imagine more assured actors like Christian Bale and Jessica Chastain in the leading roles.  Good support does come from Xander Berkeley, Harold Perrineau and Mike Pniewski.  DEXTER's Jennifer Carpenter is once again wasted in a very brief appearance, just like she was in the recent GONE.  (Maybe she and Jones should've switched?)  At any rate, movies should entertain and SEEKING JUSTICE did that for me.",1342396800,,988,5.2756410256410255

His beautiful wife Laura (January Jones), a musician at Mahalia Jackson Theatre, is brutally raped.  At the hospital, Simon Adams (Guy Pearce) tells Will that he represents a vigilante justice group that promises to kill the rapist provided that he does them a favor.  A stressed Will agrees and the rapist is shot dead.  However, six months later, Will's life becomes a living nightmare when Simon demands that he push a child pornographer, Alan Marsh, from a bridge.

  ""Seeking Justice"" asks the question:  How far will you go to obtain justice when a loved one is violated?""  There have been numerous films depicting the actions of a lone vigilante; they range from the classic ""Death Wish"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish/dp/B0000541AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish</a>) to the more current release ""The Brave One"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brave-One-Blu-ray/dp/B0010HOZWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brave One [Blu-ray</a>]).  I enjoy vigilante films because our judicial system is designed to protect the criminal.  Ask Sondra Lock's character, Jennifer Spencer, in ""Sudden Impact"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Harry-Ultimate-Collector-s-Edition-Dirty-Harry-Magnum-Force-The-Enforcer-Sudden-Impact-The-Dead-Pool-Blu-ray/dp/B001608QVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Harry: Ultimate Collector's Edition (Dirty Harry / Magnum Force / The Enforcer / Sudden Impact / The Dead Pool) [Blu-ray</a>]).  However, Will Gerard becomes entangled in a vigilante group that tries to turn him into a murderer, which he is not.  This theme was also explored in ""Point of No Return"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Point-of-No-Return-Blu-ray/dp/B001O7JHV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Point of No Return  [Blu-ray</a>]) when Bridget Fonda's street-wise character, Maggie Hayward, is sent to a secret, government-operated school to be trained as a seductive assassin.  Her training eventually failed because deep within her heart she was not a murderer.

  Will refuses to become a part of Simon's vigilante organization.  (This theme was also explored in ""The Star Chamber"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Star-Chamber/dp/B0006Z2NQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Star Chamber</a>), starring Michael Douglas; he portrays Superior Court Judge Steven R. Hardin whose conscience won't allow him to belong to an organization that sanctions the assassinations of criminals who've escaped the justice system.)  It is obvious that Simon experienced a tragedy that left a loved one seriously injured or dead; perhaps he feels that the justice system betrayed him.  His reaction was vastly different from Will's.  Will and Simon exist in all of us as spiritual entities that constantly battle, forcing us to choose between good and evil.

  ""Seeking Justice"" is a slick, psychological thriller in which Will Gerard finds himself trapped in a twisted, endless game of cat and mouse.  (I could feel the tension coming off of Will in waves; Nicholas Cage and the other lead actors gave excellent performances.)  Some of the police officers of the NOPD belong to Simon's vigilante organization.  Will doesn't know who he can trust as he is chased throughout New Orleans--a chase that ends in a bloody showdown at an abandoned mall near the superdome.  The ending is a creepy one that made me shiver with fear.  This film is perfect for conspiracy theorists.  Will reminded me of poor Rosemary Woodhouse in ""Rosemary's Baby"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-s-Baby/dp/B00003CXCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary's Baby</a>) when she discovers that everyone around her is a witch.

  Anchor Bay's DVD release of ""Seeking Justice"" is a mix bag.  The film is shown in its theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1 with Spanish subtitles and English Subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired (SDH).  As far as extras are concerned, there are a short feature, ""Seeking Justice: Behind the Scenes"" (approximately seven minutes) and a trailer.  There is the absence of audio commentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, etc.  The ""Seeking Justice: Behind the Scenes"" has some interesting interviews with the director and lead actors.  However, I was disappointed that there were no in-depth discussions concerning the shooting locales and the spectacular stunts.

  Fans of Nicholas Cage, vigilante justice films and action thrillers will want to watch ""Seeking Justice.""  If you enjoyed this film, you may want to watch some of the others I referenced above.  A lesser known gem is ""The Ladies Club"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ladies-Club-the-VHS/dp/6300189570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ladies Club,the [VHS</a>]).  A group of vigilante women, led by a female doctor, obtain vengeance against their rapists through abduction and castration.  I'm surprised Anchor Bay hasn't released this 1986 classic on DVD.  Those with strong stomachs may want to watch the 1978 classic shocker, ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Spit-on-Your-Grave-Blu-ray/dp/B004BLTNL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Spit on Your Grave [Blu-ray</a>]) starring Camille Keaton, and its 2010 remake (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Spit-on-Your-Grave-Blu-ray/dp/B0041KKYD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Spit on Your Grave [Blu-ray</a>]).

Nicholas Cage plays New Orleans high school english teacher Wil Gerard, whose wife is brutally attacked and raped. While waiting to see his wife in the hospital he is approached by a man named Simon who is played by Guy Pearce. Simon tells Wil that he knows who attacked Wil's wife, and with Wil's consent, Simon can have a stranger kill the rapist. In exchange Simon will want a favor from Wil in the future. Wil struggles with the idea initially, but is so rattled and angered by the attack on his wife that he finally agrees to Simon's plan.

Once Simon puts his plan into action, and Wil is drawn into a world of eye-for-an-eye, he begins to have serious doubts and regrets his decision to go along with Simon's plan. And once Wil's wife is released from the hospital, Simon soon shows up on his doorstep looking for Wil to fulfill his part of their bargain.

With a really solid story, and Cage's tendency to overact kept in check, ""Seeking Justice"" is a fun little thriller. Backing up Nicholas Cage is a really good cast. Guy Pearce as Simon and January Jones as Wil's wife, add more to their characters, giving a depth to the secondary characters so that we really care about them as well.

In ""Seeking Justice,"" he is New Orleans school English teacher Will Gerard.  When his wife is raped, Will is contacted by Simon (Guy Pearce), the head of a covert vigilante group that offers to get rid of the rapist if Will agrees to perform any little favor the organization might require in the future.

The unlikely scenario takes shape when that ""favor"" turns out to be far more than Will ever imagined.

Essentially, the plot is one Hitchcock explored more artfully and entertainingly in such films as ""North By Northwest,"" ""The Wrong Man,"" and ""Frenzy"" -- an individual is enmeshed in a dangerous situation beyond his control.

What sinks the movie further is January Jones, who plays Will's wife, Laura.  As beautiful as she is, and as impressive as she is on TV's ""Mad Men,"" she's stiff as an actress, and simply cannot handle emotionally demanding roles.

The ending is reasonably satisfying, and not overly moralistic, but overall I gave it three stars. Rainy day movie.",1341446400,,703,4.966101694915254
4844740,4,B005N8KPBI,"Very good solid story, plot is good, acting is solid, Nick does a great job as usual. The film itself is not a huge budget movie, otherwise this should have went to theaters. Some scenes slightly predictable but thats ok, its a great story, plenty of action. Not Nicks best but certainly not his worst.",1341273600,,302,4.509090909090909
4844741,4,B005N8KPBI,"I enjoyed the film very much! I need to preface this statement with the fact that I really care for Nicholas Cage movies. With this being said I feel I have made my opinion possibly a little slanted. If you like an actor it makes it hard not to care for their films.

With this being said my review for this film is four stars, with looking at the storyline, action, and the interface between actors. The storyline kept you on the edge of your seat and the action was superb, interaction between all the actors was very believable and it had many surprising twists at the finish. January Jones and Nicolas Cage were very believable as were the bad guys.

Keep in mind I am getting a bias because of the actors involved and my own opinion of them being positive. Take time, to rent this DVD or purchase it you will not be sorry. It is rated R and there are some very graphic violence in the scenes as well as language.

I hope this review is helpful!",1341187200,,949,4.261111111111111
4844742,2,B005N8KPBI,"I don't mind it when movies are unbelievable. After all, it is make believe. However, when they are supposed to be action packed and fail at that too then the story line becomes more important. This movie had great potential for suspense and action but failed at both. Consequently, that the story line is so hard to believe, there's little to get excited about with this flick that just never comes together. There's nothing wrong with the acting, it's just a weak plot and weak with action and suspense; something critical as this is supposed to be an action packed thriller. Too bad.",1341187200,,586,4.699029126213592
4844743,3,B005N8KPBI,"Sort of slow moving, but original and worth the watch.  It's no con air or the rock, but cage holds his own. overall, the trailer is better than the movie, and while the dialogue isn't the greatest, the premise of the movie will keep you watching till the end.",1341100800,,260,4.3061224489795915
4844744,4,B005N8KPBI,"In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Star-Chamber/dp/B0006Z2NQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Star Chamber</a>, a group of circuit court judges become increasingly frustrated as time & again suspects are let off the hook due to some legal technicality or some improper procedure(s) committed by either the police or investigators of the incident in question.  When their despair reaches a critical mass, they decide to form their own ""underground"" courtroom where they will review cases one-by-one.  Due to their expertise and diligence, they will not find anyone guilty who is not, in fact, guilty (or so they think?).  For those who are found guilty, a hit-man is summoned to bump them off.  Justice prevails (again, so they think).

The present film operates on a similar premise.  In this case, instead of judges, average, everyday people from all walks of life form a secret society designed to punish malefactors minus the cumbersome machinery of the justice system.  {As a sidenote, it is fitting that the story takes place in New Orleans;  for years & years various gangs in the N.O. area have manipulated and taken advantage of the ineptitude of the Cajun justice system.}

In both cases, whether vigilante justice is administered by judges or by regular citizens, problems are bound to occur.  Once you remove the barrier of due process and the regular rule of law, where do you stop?  And what safeguards do you  / can you put in place to ensure that the innocent are not falsely punished?
It is, after all, a very slippery slope.

All of the above questions are encapsulated in the present story.  Nicholas Cage plays a schoolteacher who is caught between a rock & a hard place after a violent crime is committed against his family.  January Jones plays his wife, and her exquisite girl-next-door beauty is nothing short of breath-taking!

Word to the wise:  this film contains some extremely disturbing images of violence against women.  If you're looking for a feel-good movie, this is NOT the one to grab.

In sum, this movie is something of a cross between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Star-Chamber/dp/B0006Z2NQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Star Chamber</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Game/dp/B000JZ3TYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Game</a>.  Of course, instead of Mike Douglas we get Nick Cage.  It's an introspective film that makes you think, and it's been my experience that that's never a bad thing.",1341100800,,2583,5.816489361702128
4844745,5,B005N8KPBI,"I was a bit skeptical at first, given that Cage sometimes chooses mediocre roles, but found myself very sucked into the story and so glad I gave it a chance!  Lots of twists and surprises and the ending does not disappoint.",1340928000,2,223,4.439024390243903
4844746,4,B005N8KPBI,"I'm a Nick Cage fan and have been disappointedly watching his films slide into ""B"" status for years.  I sighed with relief while I watched Seeking Justice, as I found it quite a bit above a ""B"" movie.  While it is unmemorable when measured against Con Air, Matchstick Men, Adaptation, City of Angels, The Family Man, and, of course, Moonstruck, it is highly watchable and has just enough thriller to justify its signified genre.  Guy Pearce is a very nice bad guy and January Jones is adorable as the action heroine/damsel in distress.  Seeking Justice has a decent script with a few twists, chase sequences, plot variations, and, for us Nicholas Cage fans, this one gets 4 stars just because it doesn't suck.",1340841600,8,709,4.739837398373984
4844747,3,B005N8KPBI,"When his wife Laura Gerard (January Jones) is assaulted on the street, an ordinary English teacher Will Gerard (Nicolas Cage) is approached at the hospital by a mysterious man. The man, who calls himself ""Simon"" (Guy Pearce), offers a deal to terribly shocked Will, promising him something that Will secretly wants.

The banal title aside, the biggest problem of ""Seeking Justice"" is familiarity. Once you get where the film is going (and that happens pretty early on), the film starts to feel sort of ""been there done that."" The potential suspense is undermined by the flat narrative and uninteresting characters (except Pearce's enigmatic ""Simon""). The premise of the thriller looks preposterous even by the standards of B action movies.

For all the flaws, I for one enjoyed the film, though, partly because I like Nicolas Cage, and partly because New Orleans locations are cleverly used as a background of the action. As to the film's action, I think Roger Donaldson as director did a decent job. The cat-and-mouse chase on the highway (not a car chase) is brilliantly done.

Considering the recent films of the star that tend to be hit or miss (and often the latter), ""Seeking Justice"" is a pretty good thriller, even though there is nothing new or original in it.",1340409600,,1269,4.920560747663552
4844748,4,B005N8KPBI,"Any Nick Cage movie is expected to be good.  At least by me.  But his latest string of 'not so wonderful' movies has left me wondering what his strategy is.  I have followed this man from a punk rocker on a date, to 'The Rock'.  He's a superb actor, in my opinion, yet wasted talent in the recent past.  Seeking Justice, I will admit was your everyday, run of the mill, predictable adventure.  Yet, I liked it.  It held my attention, which is what I seek in a 'good' movie.  It probably couldn't have been pulled off using the same script, with different actors.  The movie isn't 'The Rock', but it keeps you entertained for the duration.  Grab some popcorn and a coke....enjoy the ride.",1340409600,4,687,4.424

I don't like Tom Cruise. I don't care about DiCaprio one way or the other, but if he's in a movie that looks interesting, I'll check it out. I don't hold a personal dislike for an actor that carries on to EVERYTHING that actor does. And here's the rub: How is it that people who dislike a specific actor always seem to watch their movies? It's so you can complain about them!! How stupid is that? If you don't like tomatoes would you order a burger without them? Or would you order a burger with tomatoes every time, and then complain to holy heaven about how bad tomatoes are?! If you don't like, then don't watch. The fact that you continue to watch movies from people you obviously despise, then that means it's something wrong with you. Damn. Get a life or something.",1340409600,,949,4.3977272727272725

8480201,3,B005N8KPBI,"I think this is a film where the concept of the plot sounds better, than when you actually watch that plot as the film Seeking Justice.  Basically a school teacher (Nicolas Cage) whose wife (January Jones) is brutally raped is contacted in the waiting room of the hospital by a stranger (Guy Pearce) who offers to delve out vengeance on the rapist and make sure he can't do it again, rather than wait for the police and courts to give him a slap on the wrist.  He doesn't want financial payment, but expects Cage to do a few favours for his organisation down the track if asked. To me the main weakness of this scenario is, if you were in cage's situation, you're feeling helpless and no doubt very angry, wouldn't you ask to just be told the name and whereabouts of the rapist and deal with him yourself?  But the movie is what it is.  Of course Cage's character isn't going to want to do those favours, especially the obvious one it's going to be, when asked. But a deal is a deal and breaking it, has consequences.

Seeking Justice is worth watching but once you've gotten to the end, you start thinking as now that I know that, why on earth would this character do that, or why would the organisation do this.  Also if someone's image is on the front page of newspaper, wouldn't they shave or try and disguise themselves, change their appearance in some way?",1479513600,,1362,4.428
