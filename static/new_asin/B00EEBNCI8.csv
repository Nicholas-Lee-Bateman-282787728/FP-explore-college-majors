5909274,4,B00EEBNCI8,"This is a good movie but I liked The Christmas Box better.  I don't think there are many actors who can hold a candle to Maureen O'Hara (She's the best!!), Richard Thomas, and Annette O'Toole.  Though I didn't like it as much, it is still worth purchasing.  It gives a lot of background information for The Christmas Box storyline.",1387756800,,331,4.576271186440678

The Timepiece will answer questions and enhance the experience you will have when you watch the Christmas Box(watch it first).

Being the first part of the 2 part story, Mary and David make a wonderful couple dealing with personal issues, relationships, business and loss.
