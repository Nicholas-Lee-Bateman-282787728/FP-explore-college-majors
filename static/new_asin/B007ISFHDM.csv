8517810,5,B007ISFHDM,Mike is the truth. This is bklyns finest. In my opinion Mike is very intelligent. Listen to his analysis on this dvd after whipping someone's ass. He's dead on point and as articulate as a bklyn brute can b. Hes an original gangster who plays every opponent the same in the ring. He was just all alone. That's why he ended up with that Douglas upset. He beat him though. Cause Mike decked him too. And he got a gene tunney. He beat holyfield2. That big head bastard had3 fists. Including his head. I wud hav bit him2 if he kept ramming me with that giant cabbage. Anyway dvd is worth it. Buy it.,1434153600,,595,4.228070175438597
