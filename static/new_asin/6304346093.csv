Many of the stars, including Mae West, were in attendance. Afterward,  making my way through the stunned crowd, I came face to face with Dom  DeLuise. I will never forget the look that passed between us.",960595200,6,352,4.571428571428571

The entire movie is hilarious, probably not in the way that Mae intended, but I'm sure she's  happy to get a laugh. And the fact she did this at 85 is astounding. This  is also the only movie you see her drink alcohol in.",946944000,8,352,4.318181818181818
850564,3,6304346093,"Oh dear - she should have seen it coming - but alas when ageing sex siren Mae West made this debacle , she was one very ill advised lady (!) which is a pity,as,had she made the movie eight years earlier,at the time of  ""Myra Breckenridge"",she would probably have pulled it off,or at  least made a better stab at it . It would still have been a  ""camp-fest"" , but not the ""night of the living dead""  which resulted , when an admittedly legendary , but nevertheless  octagenarian lady was teamed up with countless hordes of ""lustful  admirers"" decades younger than she ! Despite this , there are one or  two glimpses of our darling old Mae , For example ;Dom De Luise catches Mae  coming out of the Gym ""Hiya Marlo (Manners) what've you been doin  ?"" ""Oh ,woikin out with the  boys !"" counters Mae with a  customary twinkle in her voice - momentarily  recapturing ""my old  flame"" The songs , however , are dire in the extreme , and that is  even for a diehard Mae West fan like myself . If you're feeling brave -  watch ""Sextette"" - but don't say you haven't been warned !!",929145600,,1071,4.285

850801,5,6304346093,"If you like Mae West - and I certainly do - then you will enjoy this movie. You have to give the old girl credit for being willing and able to play a sex kitten when she was 80 something. All the characters, of course, revolve around Mae who is getting married to Timothy Dalton - a noble (also a spy, but who's counting?) supposedly madly in love with Mae. Ringo Star has a very minor role. Dom Deloise plays his usual fuss-budget role as Mae's assistant. Since Mae wrote the script for the movie way back when, you know that all the action is hers, as well as all the sexy lines. The story is interesting and if you sort of take it tongue in cheek, then you have an entertaining time. I have always liked every thing Mae has done, and this movie is consistent. Like John Wayne, Mae West plays Mae West in all her glory! And as usual, Mae includes the hunky male extras so she can feel the muscles during her song. Good for her, and keep 'em coming so to speak! Again, if you like Mae then this is a good choice for you because I think it was sort of her swan song. Enjoy!",1423094400,2,1073,4.090047393364929

850804,5,6304346093,"At the start of the DVD era, Rhino released ""Sextette"" in a cardboard snap-case but the quality was worse than the company's earlier VHS release and it featured no extras, a washed-out picture and sound that was practically inaudible even with the amps cranked up to 11.  Flash-forward to 2011 when the film got a beautiful HD transfer from the original IP negatives and two new DVD releases.  The open-matte full-screen edition is available in Mill Creek's set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dangerous-Babes-12-Movie-Collection/dp/B004ZJ9W3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dangerous Babes (12 Movie Collection)</a>), and Scorpion Entertainment's stand-alone DVD includes a widescreen print and a few extras.  The picture's so crisp that you can clearly see Mae West's cataracts though there's the occasional fleck of dirt and obligatory film grain as well as mono sound.  Still, for such a poorly-regarded film it's better than one could've hoped.

If you're price-conscious, the 'Dangerous Babes' set is the way to go.  The disc is overcompressed (on a double-sided disc paired with three other low-budget dramas by the same production company) but otherwise the quality's pretty good.  Scorpion's release costs a little more but the widescreen version is framed better (let's be frank, this isn't an overtly cinematic film but there are a few sequences with dancers where more is visible on the sides), the disc compression is even and, if you're a fan of Mae West (why else would you still be reading?) there's a 40 minute interview with Ian Whitcomb, who produced an album for her (which ""Happy Birthday, 21"" was lifted from) and was hired as the music supervisor on the film... though he didn't retain that position.  Whitcomb got to know her at the end of her life and clearly had an affection for ""Miss West"" so his stories are funny, insightful -- and some remembrances about the film are recited straight from his personal diaries.  I don't know how Whitcomb got involved with this DVD release, but kudos to whomever arranged the interview.  Also available on the Scorpion release is a trailer, though the quality is pretty poor, and text ""liner notes"" by columnist Dennis Dermody.  Unlike Whitcomb's charming interview, Dermody's comments and remembrances are pretty mean-spirited.

So unless/until this goes to Blu-Ray, Scorpion Entertainment's got the best release available.",1401408000,,2428,5.479892761394102

850937,5,6304346093,"Mae West, the eighty something year old, in this riotous spoof thrilled the fans in her last technicolor feature, with a star studded cast. The young bucks like Timothy Dalton and Ringo Starr, along with her loyalty to the men she adored early in her career, like George Raft and Walter Pidgeon. The fans loved it, and the critics missed the point. They hated it. 35 years or so on, this cheeky bit of nonsense is more spoof than serious stuff, and it's a great way for everyone concerned in the making of this feature to be applauded for their efforts. Bugger the old sour puss critics. Life was made to have fun, and Mae West, thank you. You challenge our abilities to enjoy, regardless of the circumstances.",1374278400,2,710,4.5546875
850938,5,6304346093,"I own the VHS and the Rhino DVD of this movie, but the Scorpion edition here is superior.  It is higher quality and a better transfer.  The less than adequate transfer of the previous editions led many people to say things about the film that were not true.  In the previous transfers some scenes were transferred too bright and washed out.  This Scorpion edition rectifies that and is much improved.  The colors and lighting are all good on this Scorpion edition.

Mae West was still great in her last flick.  She had not lost her touch.  All the original Westian mannerisms and talent are still apparent!  Good fun for true Mae West fans.  Mae proved she was still the Queen of Camp as well as the Queen of Sex!",1372723200,,713,4.457364341085271

It's one of those that is so bad, you just can't help but watch it.

850943,4,6304346093,"The mere fact that 82-year old Miss Mae West actually made a film in 1977 is a pretty amazing thing. It took many years for her to realize filming her play ""Sextette"", but she got it done, to the delight of fans and the consternation of everyone else. Considering that her previous comeback ""Myra Breckinridge"" was such an utter disaster that this film seems like a joyful fling in comparison, Mae handles herself quite well here. The tone light & campy most of the time, Mae plays Marlowe Manners, a big-time movie star who's getting hitched (for the sixth time) to British gentleman Timothy Dalton (it's purely coincidental that a James Bond reference is made, considering he bagged the role a decade later). But the marriage is put on hold when peace talks keep breaking down (Mae's affiliation with this is her character was once married to Russian Alexis, played with flair by Tony Curtis). And so, Marlowe's manager (the always-funny Dom DeLuise) convinces her to ""take one for her country"" by stepping in & helping untangle this political mess. There's some amusing business with hubby Dalton jamming his foot in his mouth in interviews by insinuating he's gay (he misunderstands the meaning), and the contemporary covers of musical numbers are utterly cute & charming.
So how does Mae look? Well, close up, she's just not as attractive (hence, plenty of long shots). But she's in good physical shape for her age, and she still sounds like the same ol' Mae West. Fans will be relieved that she hasn't lost her touch with tossing out her trademark racy one-liners, which surprisingly, haven't lost their impact for the 1970's. Some may be shocked that Marlowe is marrying a man decades younger. But then you have to consider the facts: Hugh Hefner nearly married a 25-yr. old Playmate; and Carol Burnett remarried someone over 30 yrs. her junior. So yep, it's perfectly acceptable.
The parade of male actors is like a who's who of the times: Curtis, DeLuise, George Hamilton, Ringo Starr, Dalton, Walter Pigeon, Regis Philbin, Alice Cooper, Keith Moon, etc.
Of course, Mae has some frollicks checking out the beefcake in a gym, and she flaunts some great costumes.
Whether you love this film or thinks it's awful is up to you. Just the rarity of seeing a legend like West has to be worth the look!",1347148800,2,2303,4.80352644836272
850944,1,6304346093,"Mae West was the ultimate sex symbol in the 1930s and 1940s. She retired from movies in 1943, and only returned in the 1970s. Unfortunately, she seems to have thought that she could simply pick up where she left off.

And I'm going to try not to be ageist, but her final film, ""Sextette,"" made me squirm -- it's kind of embarrassing watching the octogenarian West awkwardly creaking out double-entendres at men fifty years younger than herself. But the rest of the story is a mess as well, involving an audio tape, the UN, and secret agents.

Movie star/sex symbol Marlo Manners (West) is marrying her sixth husband, British lord Sir Michael Barrington (Timothy Dalton). Their honeymoon is to be spent at a posh hotel, which also happens to be where all the world's leaders are congregating for some kind of conference.

And while Sir Michael embarrasses himself for the press, Marlo is approached by a gaggle of her ex-husbands (including a presumed-dead mobster), all of whom are still desperately in love with her. And her evil manager (Dom Deluise) has convinced her to destroy the audio tape of her memoirs... except he keeps fudging it.

If you've ever read a bad self-insert fanfic, you pretty much know the feeling that ""Sextette"" inspires... except it also makes you sad to see a great star looking like an awkward, lecherous mummy. It's all about how Marlo is the sexiest creature alive, and everybody with a Y chromosome -- including men SIXTY YEARS YOUNGER -- desperately wants to have sex with her.

Most of the story is devoted just to that. Marlo sashays awkwardly around the hotel, creaking out dialogue mostly made up of double entendres (""Do you get a lot of proposals from your male fans?"" ""Yeah, and what they propose is nobody's business"").

But ""Sextette"" does try to come up with more of a story... and it's a disaster. It's thin as paper and yet horrible convoluted. It tries to cram in wacky comedy, spy thrills and international intrigue, only to hamfistedly try to wrap them up in the silliest way possible. Also, there is singing. Horrible, awkward singing.

As I mentioned, it's simply saddening to see Mae West as a hollow shell of herself, slathered in mortar-like makeup and looking somewhat mummified. She's also the only actor in this movie who doesn't look heartily ashamed of herself -- Timothy Dalton, Dom Deluise, Tony Curtis, Alice Cooper and the rest all look vaguely embarrassed, as if they can't remember how they got here.

""Sextette"" is a little like watching your grandmother make a pass at your boyfriend -- embarrassing and horrendously awkward. Just pretend West never came out of retirement.",1343433600,6,2640,4.851111111111111
850945,4,6304346093,"Based upon Depression-era original play, this incredible vehicle for the Legendary Mae West, is firmly planted in the disco seventies: even Rockmen Ringo Starr and Keith Moon seem at ease with the proceedings.

A huge cast of past and present greats (with a terrific cameo by a lean and mean George Raft!) is featured in this wild story of the ultimate diva in a British Hotel, never quite finding time to consummate her marriage: the place is crawling with Diplomats (and ex-husbands). Will a cassette tape of her ""memoirs"" shake up the world?

Along for the ride is the actor who played ""Mr. Pitt"" on Seinfeld.

Fun soundtrack with mostly reworked conetmporary hits. Mae sings well, especially on ""After You've Gone"".

By the way, Mae, at 85, is superb. If her illness at the time was an issue, it's not apparent in her many scenes; in fact, she dominates the film, delivering classic lines, throughout.",1315526400,,905,4.819354838709677

851028,4,6304346093,"Despite the idiotic Dennis Dermody's (who, today, resembles a grotesque parody of Nana Mouskuri) disrespectful liner notes (where he used only the most cruel parts of past negative reviews of the film), this 2011 re-release of the film can be quite enjoyable.

It is NOT remastered, however. It is widescreen and from the master print, but not digitally corrected, so grain is still present. At last we can see Mae West's lips and eyebrows, unlike past prints, where we saw only a pale face and massive eyelashes. She looks very, very good for her age. In some shots she is a beautiful older lady, in some, well...there are only so many angles one can look great in, after the age of 60. It is interesting to note that private footage I have of West at the San Francisco premiere of 'Sextette' provide extreme close ups, and she looks roughly 55, smooth and vibrant. Her makeup is flawless as she walks up to a microphone and quips, ""I hope you enjoyed my demonstration of progressive ed-u-cation.""  The crowd of thousands is completely hysterical for her.

This is not a film I usually show my younger friends when introducing them to the phenomenon that is Mae West, but I like it. Mae West was a trouper, totally dedicated to her image. Her co-stars are every bit as campy as she is in this film, and in fact, much more over the top than she. It is a great time capsule of the late 70's.

a note: With all due respect to Ian Whitcomb (who is great at what he does) he was a little off in saying West referred to herself in the third person as ""Miss West.""  Indeed, she would often say ""We can't use that. Mae West would never say that."" But never ""Miss"" West. That would have been completely insane. Otherwise, his interview is factual and extremely interesting.",1304899200,8,1765,4.52037617554859
851029,4,6304346093,"Fans of Mae West have suffered long enough viewing inferior prints of her last film, Sextette.  Finally a newly remastered version has been released, and this vastly improved version should attract new fans for  the woman who was daring enough to stage her play ""Sex"" sixty years before Madonna published her metal bound book of the same title.

  It was Mae West's  gay connection  which helped to keep her front and centre in the collective cultural consciousness and primed for yet another revival.  Finally, in 1976, two neophyte producers,  Daniel Briggs, twenty-one and Robert Sullivan, twenty-three, announced they were bringing Sextette  to the screen.  Simultaneous with the news that Sextette  was to go into production, came an announcement from Tom Bradley, mayor of Los Angeles, that he was creating a special Mae Day and issuing a proclamation in her honor.  Bradley presented West with a scroll acclaiming her ""valuable and important role"" in the movie industry on Saturday, May 6, 1976.

  In August,  after seeing 36-year-old Timothy Dalton, West was quoted  as saying ""Don't search any further.  He's the man I want.  I've always liked Timothy Dalton since The Lion In Winter. He's charming and handsome, and he can act.  I was happy we got to work with each other in Sextette.""

  West's publicist,  Stanley Musgrove assisted in looking for a composer who could work with West and give her material that would make her look good.  In the end, veteran rhythm and blues arranger and producer, Van McCoy was hired to score the film, and his subtle disco arrangements  brought a contemporary feel to the picture. West had eight musical numbers in the film and she told Kevin Thomas, ""Isn't that funny. Instead of ""Wedding March"" they play ""Hooray for Hollywood."" According to Stanley Musgrove, Paul Novak, West's long time companion told him the dailies of Sextette  he'd seen ""Aren't so good and that the musical numbers will have to save the picture.""

  During an interview for Club  magazine,  West told a reporter,  ""I know  my rhythm and how to pace a film.  At the end of Sextette""  they wanted me to do a ballad that ended on a sad note.  I told `em,  hey, fellas,  it'll be too slow.  You'll ruin the mood we've established. I know my music.  We got to do this  right. We need something fast.  Later, when we saw the rushes, the producers told me I was right."" The soundtrack for Sextette  was never officially released; however, Crown International Pictures prepared a publicity kit for the film which  included a cassette containing the Van McCoy produced musical numbers featuring Mae West without dialogue overlapping her songs.

  When asked how she felt about her costars West was upbeat. ""We had a good time on the set.  It was quite a cast.  Dalton, Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, George Hamilton, Keith Moon, Alice Cooper, George (Raft), all those musclemen, and of course, Dom DeLuise.  I think this is the closest anyone's ever came to stealing  a picture from me!  But he's a doll.  And a very funny  man. Working with him was one of the great treats of my career.""

  Ringo Starr enjoyed working with West and invited her to a wrap-up gala he threw in a rented house on Woodrow Wilson Drive. ""I had this party there and about a hundred people came including Mae West.  We had a band and a lot of musicians and rock `n' rollers were there obviously.  Mae just sat in a big chair and all these rockers were on their knees to her because she was so great.  She had such a huge personality and she could mix with the best of them.""

  Herbert Kenwith first met Mae West when she appeared in Catherine was Great  in 1944 and over the years had been her business advisor, director and personal friend.  Perhaps he is the closest person alive to be able to speak about what really went on in her mind. Los Angeles Times Film Critic, Kevin Thomas, believed Kenwith knew more about West's insecurities than anyone. He told  Thomas that West had asked him to direct Sextette,  but he refused because he felt ""it wasn't any good, and I told her so."" In an A&E Biography on West, Kenwith recalled being with West on the last day of shooting on the Sextette  set.  ""We got into her car.  I said nothing about the film.  She asked me nothing.  The chauffeur was driving.  I was sitting on the back seat with Mae and I just continued to look out the left side of the car.  Mae was looking out the right side. We didn't talk to one another. I was determined not to talk about the film  Without any warning, she put  her hand upon mine whereupon I turned to her and she said, `Well dear, that was yesterday.  I've got to think about tomorrow.'""

  Huge pink billboards sprouted around Los Angeles proclaiming ""MAE WEST IS COMING""  but as summer passed into fall no  studio stepped forward to distribute the film. West began to worry the film might sit unseen on a shelf.  Warner Brothers agreed to show the film for a limited run in Westwood, but it upset West to discover Sextette  would be shown double billed with Outrageous!  starring Craig Russell.  West showed up for the Westwood showing but Craig Russell did not. Basinger and Duran were in attendance that evening and recalled Outrageous!  was shown first. According to  Robert Duran,  a Mae West insider who attended the event, West did not view Russell's film. ""She didn't come into the theater until the intermission.  People were out in the lobby and that's when she arrived in the white limousine.""

  In March of 1978, Briggs and Sullivan signed a lease for the Cinerama Dome near Sunset and Vine and held an old-fashioned Hollywood opening complete with floodlights, bleachers and an interview platform for arriving celebrities.  Reviews of the film  in the Los Angeles press were mixed and even  Kevin Thomas, diplomatically stated the film ""will be cherished by her fans for whom it was made.""

  While Ken Hughes tried his best  directing Sextette,  it was slaughtered by critics, and this time West was the prime target.  Friends hid the most savage reviews from her, but West instinctively knew the film wasn't what she hoped it might be.  Robert Duran stated that as far as he knew, Novak kept the bad reviews from West.  ""Maybe in  the old  days she read them,  but she'd gotten away from that.  She  knew it was a turkey.""

  Crown-International booked Sextette  into the Warfield Theater in San Francisco in November of 1978 and West travelled by automobile for the opening.  Hundreds of spectators who couldn't join the 2,200 ticket holders swarmed Market Street, and West and her entourage had  to enter through the stage door as a safety precaution.

  Sextette  opened on the East Coast in June of 1979 and was booked in several theaters in New York.  Time  stated the film was ""a work so bad, so ferally innocent, that  it is good, an instant classic to be treasured by connoisseurs of the genre everywhere.""  Reviews like this raised hope in West's mind that the picture might become a cult film similar to The Rocky Horror  Picture Show.  If West wanted to believe that and it gave her comfort, her entourage willingly obliged her.",1303776000,14,7128,4.688058489033306
851030,4,6304346093,"This new edition of Sextette presents the film in Widescreen for the first time, with a new transfer from the original print.  This corrects the fact that when the previous DVD release was pressed, an  inferior print of the film was used, which meant that the VHS version was actually better than the DVD.

As a fan of the late, great Mae West I would like to take the time to correct some factual errors repeated on the Amazon page for the original DVD by some of the other reviewers, and add a few comments of my own.  Miss West was 84 when she made this film in 1977; she died three years later on November 22, 1980, at the age of 87.  She did in fact attend the Hollywood premiere, and received a Lifetime Achievement award from After Dark magazine the same year.  The play Sextette was a minor comedy she starred in and wrote in 1961, not the 1920's.  When she toured with the stage play she was 68.  While it certainly is true that she was but a parody of herself by the time she made the film, many of her fans were grateful for the chance to see her perform one last time, as both her screen and television appearances were far too few in relation to her talent and comedic genius.

The cast included many big-league supporting actors and cameos.  Timothy Dalton, George Raft, Rona Barrett, Dom De Louise, Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, George Hamilton, Walter Pidgeon and even Alice Cooper all had scenes with the star, resulting in a film that can only be classified as pure camp.  It was a tribute to Miss West's reputation that so many of these stars were anxious to work with her.  I once met a lighting technician who was assigned to the original stage tour of Sextette, and he confirmed what I had always heard - Mae West was regarded as a total professional and a consummate artist by all who worked with her, and absolutely loved by the crews on both her movies and plays.

 Many critics were quick to promote the rumor that she was totally senile at the time of filming, and there were many rumors about how she had to have her lines fed to her through an ear-piece.  This rumor is belied by watching her lip-synch her way through any one of several songs on the soundtrack.  On ""Happy Birthday, 21"" for example, her timing is absolutely perfect and her lips move in complete harmony with the recording, not a minor feat for someone her age.  On a few of the funnier lines, her delivery is classic West at its best, and she shows flashes of her famous impeccable timing just as often as she shows her extreme age.  Yes, she looks, moves and talks like someone in their late 80's, but what can one expect?  The fact that she had the stamina and chutzpah at that age to even appear before the cameras was amazing in itself.

Strictly for fans?  Absolutely, but I for one am glad she bothered.  If you want classic Mae West get a hold of I'm No Angel, She Done Him Wrong or Klondike Annie and see her in her prime, but if you are a devoted fan you will want to see this film as well.

PS - It's about time that this woman had a major documentary devoted to her talents.  Her TV appearances, which are almost completely unavailable, include her 1959 Academy Award duet of BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE with Rock Hudson and guest stints on the Dean Martin and Red Skelton variety shows.  Her only TV appearance available on DVD is her guest shot on Mr. Ed.  The few of her TV guest shots that I've seen (which was before VCR let alone DVD was invented) were great, and I'd pay big bucks to find a DVD documentary or collection that includes them all.",1303344000,27,3551,4.334341906202723

Sextette, IIRC, is based upon one of West's plays and is basically a compendium of some of her best one-liners stitched into a wafer-thin plot involving a comedy of errors. One wedding night, five interfering ex-husbands, and disintegrating peace talks happening in the same hotel...just like in real life.

The music will make you cringe, and if you were born after 1990 you aren't going to recognize anybody. As a curiosity in cult cinema, however, I think it's worth the 2.99 rental - Keith Moon's turn alone is worth the price of admission.",1293667200,,915,4.71875

She tries to capture her magnetism with the one-liners, double-entendres and several tons of makeup and wig. She seems to sleepwalk through the entire movie and is obviously much too old to be playing the femme fatale to these considerably younger men.  A poor script and mediocre performances. The movie begins to become boring listening the same cliches and the zombie-like movements she displays.  However, for Mae West fans who would like to see her try to recapture her glory in this final hurrah, I recommend a look at it for the unique style that West possessed even well passed her heyday.

851034,5,6304346093,"This movie can only be appreciated as the true masterpiece of camp it undoubtedly is.
Mae West is delightful. True courage was needed to impersonate the courtesan character that was her trademark, at the age she did, and still get away with stealing the show. For all the other stars that are here are just background for Mae's antics and famous one-liners.
My favorite scene in the movie is when she is trying out an entire new wardrobe for a new movie, each gown more lavish, exagerated and madder in design than the last, and in the midst of it she caresses a mink coat and says ""If you want to catch a fox you have to get up early in the morning, but you've got to stay up late to get a mink"", so true to form and fabulous.
The movie was intended as a camp fest, and it is! There are wonderful musical numbers with dancing hotel attendants that are a wonderful record of gay chorus line dancing of the seventies. The Gym scene is also a wonderful record of early steroid treatments, post-liberation gay body aesthetics and the adaptation of the Farah Fawcett hairdo to men styles, a phenomenon of kitsch that has not been studied properly, as the influence of Fawcett into new frontiers of the ridiculous and tacky has not been explored as  it deserves. We really need an extensive documentary just to make sense of that hair style and how it is connected with women's hair loss in the 80's and 90's
For those who complain about the film's quality: I actually found this film to be uncannily avant-garde: It points to the future of Hollywood which is now our present, where this quality/style of directing, vapid, meaningless dialogue, and the ridiculousness of the situations is now the rule rather than the exception, but most often without any comic relief. In other words, we have been seeing variations of this movie for the last 30 years, usually starring an anorexic blonde without any of the sexiness, pizzaz or style of Mae West and certainly without that extra push towards the outer realms of true camp that Mae West can give this one.
There is also one other area, overlooked by all reviewers here, where this movie is totally ahead of its time: Mae West looks far younger than her 85 years, and her weight proportions are pretty much the same as when she was younger,  but the women her age nowdays ALL over America have this look now. The restorations of plastic surgery, the implants of botox and other substances have finally accomplished an entire population that looks like she does in this movie. We can all recognize her slightly Chinese eyes, her intensely dyed hair and reconstructed cheek bones and mouth from  the women who lunch in New York, in other words she was the archetype of a new race of women between 40 and death that has taken over the national landscape and is rapidly becoming the standard rather than the exception. From this perspective Mae west can be studied as an anthropological phenomenon that has helped form a new ""improved"" image of women and feminine beauty with no expiration date in sight. Some of the latest samples of this scientifically improved beauty can be examined every morning amongst the anchorwomen in tv channels all over the country, sporting these features on an even younger generation, but with the additional bigger, whiter teeth that are a trademark of our time.
A must-see for Mae West fans, but also for all those involved in theater and movie costumes and design, scholars of camp aesthetics, visual culture, plastic surgery and body modification.",1263168000,,3523,4.697411003236246

I'm a big fan of Mae West and I was really looking forward to this movie. As far as I was concerned, it couldn't miss: A musical with Timothy Dalton singing, Mae West as a spy, Ringo Starr and Alice Cooper. What could go wrong? Everything went wrong. I was embarrassed for the actors. This movie goes beyond camp. Very disappointing.
I purchased this movie while I was working in the Middle East and as far as I know, its still in some land fill over there. I gave it 1 star only because there isn't a lower rating. Mae West once said that she didn't want Myra Breckinridge to be her last film. Much better than this drivel.",1249516800,,642,4.270491803278689
851036,5,6304346093,"I'm not certain if most criticizing this film so callously are simply a bit daft when it comes to the gist of British humor, but they seem to be missing the vital dynamic of the movie entirely. Think of any Austin Powers movie. Are they intended to be serious Hollywood musicals with deep meaning that exhibit an abundance of musical genius? Not at all...because Mike Myers KNOWS his British humor. Wayward plots involving any combination of 'spies', sexual innuendo and campy musical numbers where characters are prone to break into song at nearly any random point throughout the film are classic trademarks of what we commonly refer to nowadays as 'spoof'. Ms. West was obviously very innovative and ahead of her time. I think it was absolutely brilliant of her to allow it filmed in such a manner. Very tongue-in-cheek! Bravo, to an extremely intelligent and elegant lady, rest her dear soul.

And also for those critiquing Tim's singing voice and phrasing during ""Love Will Keep Us Together"", he played it brilliantly as well; delivering the lyrics very in-tune with the highly upper-class 'stiffness' of Sir Michael Barrington--a British Secret Service agent who wouldn't know how to properly sing a Captain and Tennille pop-tune to save his sweet life. I absolutely applaud his unique sense of humor in tailoring the song to aptly suit the character. I have never known a better actor, nor will I ever. I found this movie utterly delightful years ago....and find it the same today, especially after having not seen it for some time. For those harsh critics, I suggest re-watching. However, this time with the lighter expectation of one not in search of great musical depth, but an appreciation for that which is better known as satire.",1224201600,,1741,4.9419795221843

851158,5,6304346093,"I first bought this movie on VHS many years ago. I have every Mae West film, including the hard to find ""The Heats On"", which I don't think has ever been out on DVD. So believe me when I tell you, I am a huge fan of Mae West. I have her albums, a doll of her, books on her and a few other rare collectibles.

Sextette is by no means ""oscar material"", but it makes no sense to me at all why so many people insist on bashing Sextette so badly. I must agree with the previous reviewer who said this movie only has a bad storyline if you compare it to Citizen Kane. In other words, taken for what it is, a fun, campy movie, Sextette is great.

First off, I read in one of my Mae West books that making Sextette was NOT Mae's idea. She was approached by those who wanted it made and she agreed. They said she had good days when she was ""on"" and other days where they couldn't get her to remember anything. Other days she thought she was back in the 1930's. However, overall, her performance is wonderful and everyone in the cast was so good, they helped sell her. I don't know how much of that is true about her condition, but assuming it is, she did a great job. The Mae West we all know comes through in many scenes.

To truly enjoy Sextette, first off you must suspend reality. Mae does not look like she's in her 80's here. She looks like she's around her late 50's or early 60's. I know a lot of women now in their 50's who don't look half as good as Mae did in this movie. In any case, we are encouraged to believe she is still the Mae West we knew in 1933. Once you forget the details about her age, and once you realize this is a campy 70's movie, you can appreciate that there really is a plot and there is a lot of funny stuff in this film which is well delivered. The performances of Ringo Starr, Dom Deluise, George Hamilton and others are excellent.

Why did all these stars want to do this movie? Probably for the same reason true Mae West fans wanted to see it. A tribute to a legend. A woman who never let the system beat her down. A woman who took on Hollywood back when it was truely a man's world. A woman who saved Paramount studios from going bankrupt during the Great Depression. A woman who wrote her own screenplays and Broadway plays when those areas were also male dominated. Mae West was not just a great performer and entertainer, she was a great business woman and a great writer. She was truely ahead of her time.

As for the criticisms about her age, I also agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out that Mae was almost 40 when she first came to Hollywood. When she did ""I'm No Angel"" in 1933 she was 40 and I think she looked great for 40, especially in a day long before anti-oxidants and botox. And as for her shape in Sextette, she sure doesn't look like a young woman, but her body isn't bad at all for her age. She's still got an hourglass shape. They shouldn't have given her a big, fluffy wedding gown in the opening scene, though. She'd have been better off with a tapered gown, but most of her gowns were gorgeous in this film and her dress maker in the movie is hilarious. Compare her shape here to her shape in the 1940 film ""My Little Chickadee"" with WC Feilds and she doesn't look all that different except for maybe a little more hunch to the shoulders.

All in all this movie is a movie for Mae's fans. It gives us one last chance to see her do her thing and give us those fun one-liners that made her so famous. If I had to make any real criticism of this film, it would be that some of the musical numbers were not so fabulous. ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" was my least favorite, but even the cheesey musical numbers are fun enough to sit through. The creators of this movie did NOT intend this to be a serious musical like ""The Sound of Music"" or anything of that caliber.

The bottom line is to suspend reality and enjoy it for what they intended it to be. A campy, fun tribute to a fabuous Hollywood legend. Nothing more or less than that.",1199750400,6,3993,4.144516129032258

851160,5,6304346093,"The good news is that this is one of the most frightening horror movies ever made. The bad news is that it was supposed to be a musical comedy. (Bad comedies are painful, bad musicals are worse, and combining the two, then adding in liberal sexual innuendo involving an eighty-five year old former sexpot is agony.) But Sextette is never boring. It can't be...there's virtually a new TERROR around every corner!

This unbelievably misguided project from director Ken Hughes and screenwriter Herbert Baker takes Mae West's 1926 play SEX and reimagines it as a romance between the 85-year old West and 32-year old Timothy Dalton. And while Mae and her latest hubbie (future James Bond star, Dalton) lounge around their palatial honeymoon suite, Mae reminisces about her past conquests while a roster of escapees from the Hollywood Squares stumble through.

There's the always-confused Ringo Starr as a Stroheim-like director; leather-skinned George Hamilton as a pinstriped gangster; Alice Cooper in a permed `Barry Manilow-style' wig and tuxedo; Keith Moon as a foppy fashion designer; plus Dom DeLuise, George Raft, Regis Philbin, Rona Barrett -- the list of has-beens and never-will-be's goes on and on ...and on!  Meanwhile, the viewer gets to grind their teeth at the loose excuse for a plot, in which the U.S. government begs Mae to spend a night with one of her ex's, a Russian bigwig (Tony Curtis), in order to save diplomatic relations.

But the show really belongs to its octogenarian leading lady, (who at this point in her life must have been giving her corset-maker hazard pay), in her final and most astounding screen role. The most bizarre thing about Sextette is that it pretends that its star is still in her twenties! and has her firing off racy double-entendres that will make every viewer nauseous with their quasi-necrophilic implications. The star is filmed in such soft-focus that one can barely make out her face. She shambles across the sets like she's about to fall over, and when she recites trademark zingers like, ""I'm the girl who works at Paramount all day and Fox all night,"" (Say it out loud), she seems to have forgotten what they mean. The most horrifying exchange comes when she caresses her breasts provocatively, causing Dalton to embrace her and break into an ear-melting rendition of ""Love Will Keep Us Together.""

YES! Just when you think it's as cheesy as it could ever possibly get, the entire cast breaks into song and dance, and you remember it's also a freaking musical! You haven't lived until you've heard Dom DeLuise creaking out a cover of the Beatles' ""Honey Pie""? Other low lights have West crooning ""Happy Birthday"" while pawing a 21-year-old youth in a gym full of Olympic bodybuilders and lip-synching another standard to which she appears to have forgotten the words. And we'll bet you thought AT LONG LAST LOVE was interminable!...

The whole mess ends with West singing ""Babyface"" (astonishingly, she's referring to herself) and sneaking onto Dalton's yacht for a really sick-making seduction scene. We'd like to tell you that the movie has a happy ending, (if having sex with an eighty-five year-old woman qualifies as ""happy"") but the viewer's side of the experience is something far less pleasant.

Sextette is a jaw-droppingly Bad Move We Love that separates true worshipers of heinous cinema from the fainthearted. It is defiantly one for the record books, and most certainly not recommended for viewing on an empty stomach.",1196553600,,3485,5.0190311418685125

For one thing, there is NO OTHER movie star in history that endured the way Mae did.  She is witty, sexy and as frisky as ever in Sextette. Ringo Starr told TV Guide concerning Mae's performance in Sextette, ""the minute she opened her mouth I knew I didn't' have a dog's chance...she is so fan-bloody-tastic that she just wipes us out!""

It is well past time for the ""critics"" to give it a rest.  It is time to stop trying to outdo Rex Reed in viciousness.  It is also time to stop discriminating against someone because of the person's age.

The GREAT Mae West was still the Queen of Sex when she made Sextette, and she always will be!!!  She is still the Eighth Wonder of the World!!!

Mae West was still the greatest star in the history of the world when she made this movie.  I find the nasty, error-filled comments of so-called ""critics"" here that relentlessly attack this film (and the disgusting comments) offensive in the extreme!  ALL (every single one) of the ruthless attacks against this film here are age prejudiced criticisms that have absolutely not merit.  The attacks all say the same tired things, over and over.  They attack Miss West because (and only because) of her age.  And the fact is, they have all the so-called facts wrong to the maximum degree!

This film is truly entertaining, well made, well filmed and very campy and funny.  This is exactly what this film set out to do too.

The constant attacks against this film try to imply that Mae was playing a part of a ""young hottie"" when in fact the film makes it VERY PLAIN that she is a LEGENDARY film star from the golden age of Hollywood.

The attacks state trashy urban legends (hidden earpieces force-feeding lines, wigs, cosmetic surgery, etc.) and all these things have been brought to truthful light at Wikipedia.com.

IT IS TIME for truthful, honest, non age-prejudiced reviews....and here it IS!  First of all this film is truly amazing due to the fact that Miss West delivered an INCREDIBLE and AMAZING performance in this film, especially considering her age!

Mae West never had a face lift or cosmetic surgery of any kind in her life and that is an established fact!  Comments saying she slurred her speech, was grossly overweight, did not know what she was doing are completely untrue and most importantly completely UNFAIR!  Any time you have people attacking someone because of their age you better think twice before you believe it!

The fact is that Mae West in Sextette, was AMAZINGLY like her former self in her old movies!  ALL the astonishing and legendary mannerisms are here right in this film!  Mae was not overweight, was not ""lifted"" and was not ""senile"" when she made this film.  This film could have NEVER been made if the lies that are posted here were true.

Now let me say this...NO, this film is not ""Gone With The Wind"" and no one ever thought it was.  But the fact is that this movie is an entertaining feature especially for a last film for a super mega star.  When it comes to SUPER MEGA STAR status, well, NOBODY in the history of film can compete with the legendary Mae West!  It is inhumane and cruel to allow the ruthless comments here with distorted facts attacking this film.  If you do not like a film, well that is one thing and that is fine, but to ruthlessly attack a person, saying horrendous things about another human being is unjust, cruel and just PLAIN NOT FAIR!

 Mae West was and remains the GREATEST star in the history of the world.  She is the ONLY star in history to have her name listed in Webster's Dictionary.  She saved Paramount Pictures from bankruptcy, she was the highest paid woman in the world at one time, and NOBODY can deny that her personality was unlike anything ever before of since!  Let us give Mae credit for an ASTONISHING and AMAZING performance in a final film!  Let us give her credit for an amazing performance for a performer at the age she was in this film.  What about looking at all that instead of hateful, cruel, ruthless and unfair attacks?  When I read some of these terrible reviews and the incredibly ruthless things that are said I just have to wonder what kind of nasty so-called human being would even post such comments.

851165,5,6304346093,"Sextette tells the story of Marlo Manners, played by Mae West, who is in London to marry her sixth husband. Sir Michael Barrington, played so ably by Timothy Dalton, will be Marlo's sixth husband. Oh yes, they do get married--but after the wedding ceremony the press, Marlo's Hollywood agent Dan Turner and a cast of what seems like thousands all pester Marlo and Michael. They will not leave them alone to enjoy their wedding night. The plot is indeed thin and rather silly; but Sextette keeps your attention with its campy qualities and outlandish scenarios. The subplots poke fun at whirlwind courtships and Hollywood itself--excellent!

Before the wedding night can begin, Marlo faces pressure to wine and dine a Russian diplomat so that he can have one last fling with her in exchange for his ""yes"" vote on an international accord. Of course, this subplot couldn't stop at that--this Russian diplomat would have to be one of Marlo's five ex husbands, too! Marlo's obligations don't end there--she must do screen tests in her honeymoon suite directed by another ex played wonderfully by Ringo Starr. Sir Michael Barrington also has a burden; he must prove to the public that he likes women after there is an honest misunderstanding during a television interview Sir Michael gives to Rona Barrett. To complicate matters even further, people hunt to find Marlo's memoirs tape which goes missing; this could harm Marlo's image if the press were to capture it.

The subplots explore whirlwind courtships and the divorces that are obtained even faster than the courtships ever were. At one point Marlo's agent asks her if she remembered ""that week and a half when (she) was a widow."" Marlo remembers--and she did mourn the loss of her husband, too. Sure, she played the piano to forget her pain--but ""only the black keys.""

The cinematography shines strongest in the opening scenes when the wedding procession arrives at the hotel; and the scenes filmed on top of the hotel are well done, too. The choreography of every scene in the hotel gymnasium and the international summit reflects careful planning, too. The song and dance numbers are particularly well choreographed.

There are a few songs in this movie although I can't call it a ""true-blue"" musical. Marlo sings a rendition of ""Happy Birthday, Sweet Sixteen"" to a young athlete training in the hotel gymnasium. ""Hooray For Hollywood"" and ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" show forethought as well. Unfortunately, most of the other songs are cute but forgettable.

There are numerous cameos to spice up the film even further: Look for George Hamilton who has a brief role as one of Marlo's ex husbands; a young Regis Philbin playing himself at the very beginning of the movie; Alice Cooper as a waiter and Rona Barrett playing herself as a television news reporter.

The DVD does not come with any extras. This disappoints me but it is a minor flaw.

I agree with the reviewer who writes that if you like Mae West you'll love Sextette. Fans of campy movies with razor thin plots will also enjoy this movie. This was Mae West's final film. Nevertheless, in Sextette Mae still did what she always did best--delivering punchy one line double-entendres and shimmying all over the screen as self-confident as ever.

851280,4,6304346093,"Now, this is a real anomaly:  Mae West starring in a film based on a successful play she wrote back in 1926.  So theoretically, this film could have been made into a silent movie, and here it is, turning up over 50 years later in 1978.  And even in these more enlightened times, they didn't use the original title of Sex, calling it Sextette instead (although the opening credits put the first three letters into slight relief for those who might otherwise have missed it).

I'm a big fan of Mae West, and I finally let my curiosity get the better of me about her final film, which I have been warned against many times.  Happily, I thought it was a delight from beginning to end.

Mae West is unique in the history of sex stars in the movies because she was able somehow to both play the role of a sex goddess and simultaneously parody that same role.  So while other sex queens could not have gotten away with doing such a role as this one at the age of 85, Mae does much more than ""get away with it,"" and even at this age it's not all parody all the time.

Allowances do have to be made for a very few things.  Her wig is one of them, her slightly bizarre makeup that makes her eyes seem way too far apart is another, and her slow movements from time to time is the final one.  Still, she has obviously taken very good care of herself over the years, and gets to show herself off at one point in a series of beautiful gowns (with Keith Moon over the top as her dress designer) as she supposedly prepares herself for a screen test.

She is clearly having a lot of fun.  The film is set up so that she can consistently deliver the one-liners that made her famous.  And these one-liners still work for her, some 45 years after she used this technique in her first film.  (And the line about being ""the girl who works for Paramount all day and . . . "" is probably the funniest of any of her one-liners.)  I sat there with a huge smile on my face anytime Mae was onscreen.  I would consider her an inspiration to those who feel that after they reach a certain age, it's time to give up.  Mae West is just as effervescent and zestful here as she was in her 1930s films.

Her co-stars are quite good, with Dom DeLuise leading the pack, followed closely by (in no particular order) Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, George Hamilton, and Alice Cooper.  I hope I can be forgiven for thinking that Timothy Dalton, who makes up the final member of the Sextette of the title is not quite in their league (and by the way, ""sex"" is Latin for ""six"" and I suspect that the original title is more about this than it is about ""the act"").  Then again Dalton is playing the straight man to all these buffoons, and so his part is a little less showy than theirs.  Also, his singing voice is decent although he could stand some lessons on phrasing (not breaking the musical line partway through the phrase).

And speaking of singing, Mae does three numbers through the course of the film.  She makes winners out of all three both through her singing voice (remember she even creditably sang opera in 1935's Goin' to Town) and through the force of her personality.  Now, this is something we would have missed out if Sextette had been made as a silent.

There are a number of star cameo turns.  It's fun to see Regis Philbin way back when (I didn't realize he was that well known in 1978), it's a trip down memory lane to see the once-ubiquitous Rona Barrett, and a bit bizarre to see one Ed Beheler playing Jimmy Carter, something he apparently made a minor career out of (even in some GOP campaign ads).  Probably the most touching cameo is that of George Raft, who played the lead in Mae's first film, Night After Night, from 1932.

And of course Mae loved to surround herself with bodybuilders, and she gets a scene with a number of them here.  And these are not just guys they picked up off the street; they all have athletic credentials or hold titles such as Mr. America, as is indicated in the closing credits.

Okay, so Gone with the Wind it's not (hence 4 stars instead of 5).  It's still a lot of fun, and it's great to see Mae West go out in such grand style.",1151539200,10,4142,4.271794871794872
851281,1,6304346093,"Mae West became a sex symbol not because of the way she looked but because of the way she spoke. Her unique delivery coupled with memorable, highly quotable double entendres (""Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?"") were the highlights of her early-'30s movies. In SEXTETTE (1978), her final film, a fossilized, eighty-something Mae delivers the same kind of dialogue that made her famous way back when, and the result is a textbook example of how not to grow old gracefully.

In this West-scripted endeavor, Mae immodestly casts herself as sex queen Marlo Manners, the World's Most Desirable Woman (yikes!), who can't seem to keep men from pursuing her, even when she's on her honeymoon. The once-in-a-lifetime supporting cast includes Timothy Dalton, Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, George Hamilton, Alice Cooper, Dom DeLuise, Keith Moon, George Raft, and Regis Philbin. People say you can't go home again and it's true; embarrassingly, the respirator-ready West apparently felt she never left home to begin with.

Legendary movies that are total classics make Mae one of the greatest ever top female Superstars...in her 80's Mae West once again treated us to a view of the legend and many found pleasure in this fun movie that once again gives us a chance to have a view of the classic and very legendary Mae West!  God forbid anyone or any of us age...Mae was never conventional having started her motion picture career in her forties and continued the following decades doing various stage and recording projects so it wasn't surprising that Mae West would do yet another motion picture once again in her eigthies!!! Mae was still very entertaining and had the thrill of going to the preview of this delightful movie in 1978 in Westwood California & had a strong feeling Mae West would attend. A line formed & arriving early we were the red velvet ropes and soon a red carpet rolled out and media came from everywhere equiped with boom mikes that started curbside and lined the red carpet!  Up came a shining limousine and out came a sparkling and radiant Mae West with a strapping guys in tuxedos on each arm...Mae in person looked magnificent and the crowd went wild...she strutted up the red carpet and stopped at each interviewer and popped off witty and very funny one liners that had everyone cracking up!  Mae West looked gorgeous and we gave her a standing ovation inside of the theatre when it was announced over the PA that she was in attendance then a spotlight lit her up...luckily seated a few rows in front of Maem, got to look directly at her and give her a big smile and let out a few Bravo's...Mae was beaming and it was a magical event never to forget!  Find it very sad some strangely put down her last effort to entertain and everyone loved this ""over the top"" entertaining movie on that great afternoon in Westwood and still do!  Recently watched Sextette with a friend and we laughed and loved every moment of the Magic Of Mae West with a fun cast of amusing characters including a wonderful performance by Dom Deluise...watch how Mae lights up when George Raft appears on screen with her! Those who think that life is perfect and legends never age...get over it and get a reality check. Thank you Mae West for your genius and sharing your incredible and wonderous gifts for some seventy-plus years and for the support that you warmly gave the Gay Community at a time when few would even get close...the best in the West left behind a treasure chest of classics for us to savor and enjoy!!! If you love Mae then grab this while you can as cult favorites such as Sextette usually have a short release run...BRAVO MAE WEST!",1115683200,29,2813,4.56039603960396

Timothy Dalton of James Bond fame, Ringo Starr, Dom Deluise, Walter Pidgeon, Regis Philbin and many others appear in it too. West is Marlo Manners, legendary Hollywood sex queen! Many famous songs get a dubious revival in this unbelievable film. You will just have to see it to believe it!",1107129600,9,551,4.690721649484536
851286,4,6304346093,"Don't get me wrong, this is a d-r-r-r-eadful movie, but for once the phrase ""So bad that it's good"" is actually true.  This was Ms. West's last movie before her death and she appears to be semi-mummified and barely conscious in all her scenes. (After all she was nearly eighty years old.) Still she trots out all the lines for which she's famous - ""Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"" ""Come up and see me"", etc. - standing or lying stiff as a board, however the crew happens to have propped her up I guess.  Several well-known actors disgraced their resums with this picture - Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr and George Hamilton play former husbands, Timothy Dalton plays her current one, Dom Deluise is her manager, the likes of Regis Philbin and Rona Barrett play themselves in cameos, and Alice Cooper plays a singing waiter. (I don't think anyone has heard of him since.)
Yes, it is a musical.  When Ms. West (in her role of Marlo Manners, famous movie star) enters the lobby of the British hotel where she is spending her honeymoon, the hotel staff begins to dance in a circle around her, singing ""Hooray for Hollywood"".  Ms. West is given such numbers as the Lennon/McCartney crooner ""Honey Pie"", a disco rendition of ""Baby Face"" delivered to the members of an international summit meeting, and a Sedaka song about someone turning twenty-one sung to a roomful of nearly-naked bodybuilders. Absolutely not to be missed, however,  is Timothy Dalton singing ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" to his newlywed bride. As if the Captain and Tennille version wasn't bad enough.
This isn't one of those DVD's that presents a lovingly-frame-by-frame restoration of a film.  There are no extras whatsoever; it's not widescreen.  It looks crappy, but then, it IS crappy.",1104192000,9,1780,4.741100323624596
851287,3,6304346093,"Why oh why would anyone green light this film?  I can only imagine that Mae West must have put up the money for the film, because it just doesn't make sense!

Mae West was never an accomplished dramatic actress.  She was a sex kitten - even a provacateur way ahead of her time - in mostly sexual comedies of the 1930's and 1940's.  At that, West was tops.

In Sextette, West chose to resurrect a script she had written for production back in the 1930's.  It is the same script some 40 years later.  While that in and of itself is not a bad thing -West stars as the sex kitten once again!  That is not good.  The film is full of her famous inuendo (which is great), but it is also full of her famous inuendo uttered by her at the tender age of 150.

Honestly, Mae West couldn't look worse!  She is shot through so much gauze that she actually looks plastic at times.  The director has mentioned that she couldn't remember her lines, so they shot her by herself and fed her lines through a device in her ear.  She just repeated the lines as only she could.

That her costumes and her gait are the same some 40 years later is less a testament to the film and her abilities than it is to the sad nature of her career.  In an interview some years ago, a friend of hers noted that Mae West had long ago lost any semblance of who Mae West the woman was and only knew how to be ""Mae West: Sex Kitten"".  It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that she was in her late 80's when she appeared in this film (in fact she died less than two years after the film was released).

The film is a quaint little sexual farce built inside a very light piece of intrigue.  The whole of the film hinges on West and it is West that you pay the price of admission to see.  However, to see Timothy Dalton play West's much younger husband is really icky.  George Hamilton and Dom Deluise also appear in large parts.

It's a bizarre little film, that truly is a train wreck, but one worth the price of admission.  However, if you are a Mae West lover, it is a sad footnote to a delightful career.",1095724800,6,2078,4.104218362282879
851288,5,6304346093,"That Greta Garbo retired from films in her mid thirties did more to keep her memory and ""the mystique"" alive than anything else she could have done. That Mae West decided to film ""Sextette"" in the late Seventies, when she was in her mid eighties, is the flip side of Garbo: the Baby-Jane-Norma-Desmond syndrome descended upon a new world with new values. And to pair West with the young Timothy Dalton and expect the audience to take the romance seriously further complicates this already messy film.  Part musical, part comedy, part Grand Guignol, this film should be seen for the five-star lesson it presents: know when to gracefully retire, leaving only the fondest of memories, Garbo-like, captured on film forever.",1088812800,9,719,4.991666666666666
851289,3,6304346093,"Ok, a lot of reviewers seem to love this film, and I must say I enjoyed watching it too...but only due to the constant jaw-dropping horror and surprise I experienced during this unfathomable exercise in ""entertainment.""
The plot...well, simply it doesn't matter. Suffice to say that Mae West must be well over 80, but she plays a Hollywood sex bomb who has just married for the 6th time. She is greeted by a level of hysteria on arrival in London that rivals the second coming (albeit on a budget). Her new husband is a young Timothy Dalton, long before his James Bond years. The married couple book into a posh London hotel and there are plenty of ""laughs"" to follow as their planned night of wedded bliss is constantly interrupted by various capers and intruding ex husbands. My reaction to this was...""Thank God for that""! The notion of an 80+ year old woman fighting off the attention of all these 30 something young suitors is plain ridiculous. Its sooo obvious that Mae (game though she is throughout) is simply way too old to make this role believeable. She can barely walk, and her acting consists of little more than creaking around in tight, figure hugging gowns and feathers (mmm...), patting her platinum curls and reading out vulgar double-entendres in answer to any query from a male member of the cast. I don't think she had a single line in the whole film that a) wasn't dirty, and b) contributed something to the plot!
If you can suspend your disbelief about this situation long enough to concentrate on the rest of the film, you'll be blown away by the sheer ineptitude of it, not least of all the musical numbers. At one point, all the staff and guests in Mae's London hotel lobby suddenly break into ""Hooray For Hollywood"" as she checks in...so wrong, and for so many reasons! Then later, Mae and Dalton enjoy a (barely) sung duet of ""Love Will Keep Us Together"", and there are many more just as bad. Mae has a few brief solo numbers of her own, and its obvious that she didn't have the energy (or the voice) to pull them off, but they are here all the same. Its all so pitiful and there isn't a shred of irony about it. Some reviewers say the film is tongue in cheek, and is not taking itself seriously. I disagree. The film is obviously intended to be a tribute to the curvaceous charms of its star..it's just 40 years too late! But I'm glad, because the amount of laughs you'll get from watching it are doubled for this very reason. There are loads more howlers that I don't have the space to even go into, but nothing matches the bare-faced inappropriateness of the central issue. So do Mae and Tim ever get it together for a night of passion...? If the idea doesn't turn your stomach, get this DVD and find out!",1083024000,5,2736,4.507042253521127

851388,4,6304346093,"Yes, baffled as to why so many people on the web have reviewed this film with such hostility and sadistic glee. It seems the biggest complaints against this movie is that #1)Mae West was in her eighties when she made it. Not one reviewer can honestly say that she looked more than in her late fifties in Sextette. Remember that she was in her forties at the height of her career, not a huge discrepancy. #2)Her waistline doesn't exist. Not only is that an exaggeration, but she was never slender to begin with, so her extra pounds should come as no surprise. #3) The script is bad. Well it's only bad if you're comparing it to Citizen Kane. This is supposed to be fun, vain silliness, and it is. Mae West and Dom Deluise are hilarious, and Timothy Dalton, Ringo Starr, and Tony Curtis really seem to be enjoying themselves and giving it their all. I loved all the cameos; the chemistry amongst the entire cast is magic, surprising when one considers that West reportedly disliked most of the choices. Yes, the duet was corny and ridiculous, but funny (even if the humor was unintentional). The only problem I can name with this film is the language in the kitchen scene, it will be insulting to certain ethnic people. Although it's really no more un-PC than the depiction of the giggling, submissive, broken-English-speaking Black maids in her earlier films. What I find disturbing is that reviewers have more of a problem with West's age than the off-color ""humor"" against foreigners in the kitchen scene.
Once I saw this film a second time, the script actually made a lot more sense and was more intricate than I first realized. Believe me, when I, a Mae West fan, ordered this tape I thought I was going to be seeing one of the most boring, stupid, wastes-of-times in Hollywood's 100 year history. Thankfully, i was disappointed!
The best part is that Sextette doesn't take itself seriously and doesn't expect its viewers to, either. It assumes its audience is intelligent enough to know camp when it sees it. Several of us do recognize it and appreciate this. Too bad there's the rest out there.
BTW, tf this film is still unbearable, I suggest She Done Him Wrong. West is almost fifty years younger, for you agists out there, and her waistline has to be about twenty inches round, lol. But don't expect the script to be any less flamboyant.",1043798400,27,2345,4.653012048192771
851389,3,6304346093,I just finished reading the reviews of others in this section.  Now if this film was terrible why did they sit through long enough to review - I'm sure there was a review and the next one just went along with the first and so forth because they thought they were being clever.  Mae West knew what she was doing - she did this film for her fans.  Take another look at her and wonder if you or someone you know will look that good into their 80's.  Just look at the auction sites on line and see just how popular Mae West is to this day.  Who remembers Betty Grable or Jane Russell in the same way they remember Mae West.  The trouble with this movie was bad direction and a poor screenplay - Mae West accomplished what she wanted in this film and if you are ready for a little escape and some silly fun buy this movie and enjoy Mae West's last film!,1033344000,12,848,4.078313253012048

Recoil in horror as the reanimated corpse of Mae West spouts sexual innuendos that were stale 60 years before this film was made!
  Of course, even without Ms. West dottering around the set this movie would be unwatchable. The screenplay is dreck and it was seemingly directed by Helen Keller.

7868702,2,6304346093,"Today was the first time I've seen Mae's last movie.  I'm becoming quite a fan of Mae's.  She was a true legend from old Hollywood.  She played by her rules and wrote most of her plays/movies.  Who does that now?  She was quite ahead of her time, doing things that in those days were considered vulgar.  She was the original Bette Midler of the 30's/40's.  Why she only made 12 films in her entire career is baffling.  Sextette was her last movie, coming off the incredibly horrid Myra Breckenridge.  It's a shame her two last movies were forgettable.  Although better then Myra, Sextette is loosely based on an old play she wrote in the 1920's.  Sadly there is a litany of problems with the movie.  There isn't much of a plot:  an aging blonde starlet is asked to comvince a russian politician to agree to some sort of agreement.  There is a political summit going on in the hotel Marla (Mae West) is staying in for her honeymoon with her much, much, much younger 6th husband played very well by an adorable (if slightly anorexic looking) Timothy Dalton.  Apparently if the deal isn't agreed upon it could end world peace (what kind of deal it is and why would it stop world peace is never mentioned).  Her manager (played by the overacting Dom DeLuise) talks her into getting cozy with the russian pollitician, Alexei Andreyev Karansky (played by yet another overacting star Tony Curtis), so he would agree to whatever the political deal is.  Most of the scenes involve lots of men and Mae's snappy double entendres.  The film script isn't well thought out.  There isn't much going on.  Mae gives a brilliant performance here.  She is one of the best looking ladies I've seen that were in their 80's.  Her face looks pale from all the pounds of makeup and those eyelashes (she looks asleep half of the time cause you really can't see her eyes much through those long eyelashes).  There are cameos galore in the movie.  From Regis Philbin to Keith Moon (who's performance is so over the top it's campy and one of the best scenes).  I've never liked Tony Curtis or Dom DeLuise who always seemed to overact.  The worst part of the movie is a vastly unnecessary solo number by DeLuise.  Mae made the movie for the fans, we are certainly grateful.  I was only 4 when it was originally released.  There are lot of ridiculous rumors surrounding the making of the movie.  One of the rumors was that Mae was senile from Alzheimer's Disease.  This is a lie.  Mae was never diagnosed with Alzheimer's nor was she senile.  She was 84!  You can't expect her to do stuff she did in her 30's.  Another lie was about how she ""couldn't walk anymore"" so allegedly she was put on a trolley and faked walking.  I studied her movement quite well and there isn't a scene that appears that she really isn't walking.  She did, however, have major hearing loss and had to wear a hearing aid type device so that the director (who was constantly changing Mae's dialogue) could feed her the lines.  It's a shame this is the last thing she did professionally before her death in November 1980 (her death would soon be overshadowed by John Lennon's murder a few weeks later).  It is fun watching Mae, I won't deny that, in all her glory.  It's a shame the plot is thin and some of the actors terrible (George Hamilton are you listening??).",1430179200,,3311,4.5363790186125215

I have to say I smiled through the whole movie! I'm smiling now as I write this, just remembering the movie. It was a lot of Mae West's bits from her old movies. To her gangster 5th husband, played by George Hamilton ""Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"" I read from previous reviews, that she did this movie for her fans. As a fan, I say Thank You Mae West!!!",1429401600,,562,4.026785714285714
