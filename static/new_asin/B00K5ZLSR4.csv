8656160,4,B00K5ZLSR4,"Saw this at a special screening, and kinda knew what to expect but not exactly. Most of the movie is one long take with a few scenes edited in, so you really get the real time tension that the film brings. Elissa really puts herself in the character and when things go south, you really start to feel and worry for her. The film is pretty out there and surreal and may not be to everyone's taste but it's not so far out that you shouldn't take a chance on it because it is worth watching for sure. You've probably never seen anything like this before. So give it a shot.",1400630400,5,570,4.1441441441441444
