5361157,1,B009RJRJ2C,"When this first started to play, I stopped it to make several image quality adjustments to my TV.  Nothing helped, the imagery lacked contrast and the colors were muted.  The content of the entire DVD is a series of short summaries of dead Hollywood figures.  No real insight, just a few well known details thrown together.  I collect documentaries and I have a good collection for the Hollywood golden age.  Comparitively, this DVD was like a comic book vs War and Peace.  To clarify, I'm referring to this DVD as the comic book.

And because of that, their energy is possibly still with us. These are all short stories of each celebrity and they are concise, short to the point without going into much detail but still entertaining.

5361305,5,B009RJRJ2C,First off it appears to have been made in the 50s yet release date is 1990. Unless it was made beforehand but regardless I am a total movie trivia pop culture buff and I really enjoyed this. One scene shows Boris karloff and bela lugosi together in some kind of 2  minute blurb and it is so cute. I'd never seen it before things like this add to the five star review. It might seem like it was made during  the McCarthy era but it makes up for it in good campy fun,1444780800,4,464,3.978494623655914

5361315,5,B009RJRJ2C,"I like all the actresses and actors in this DVD. Very glad to have it and that it has finally come to dvd, although the program itself looks like it was done in 1989 or the late '80s by the looks of the graphics. The narration is good. The same guy that does this narration did an earlier DVD about the ""Our Gang"" and ""Little Rascals"". I found ""Hollywood Heaven"" to be both informative and entertaining.
The narrator, though, mispronounces James Dougherty's last name saying ""Dock er ty"" and it seemed the homosexual themes took it over at times toward the end.  I personally do not care if they were that way or not, it didn't affect the performance in the movies they were in, in my opinion.

We all know Rock Hudson was probably one of the first well known actors to be gay and have this disgusting disease known as AIDS, which tore him up and eventually killed him in 1985. This video says James Dean was a homosexual also and that Rock and him didn't get along while making the film ""Giant"". The narrator suggests something else may have been going on during the production. Both were outstanding and they are missed in todays ""Remake after Remake"" Hollywood.

Here are the actors and actresses covered :

Rudolph Valentino
W.C. Fields
Bela Lugosi
Tyrone Power
Alan Ladd
Sharon Tate
Steve McQueen
George Reeves
Natalie Wood
James Dean
Rock Hudson
Marilyn Monroe",1396483200,24,1366,4.609053497942387
5361316,5,B009RJRJ2C,What can I say? I totally loved this DVD in that it features some of the greatest Hollywood stars of all time. I am a huge Marilyn Monroe fan as well as a big fan of James Dean. Natalie Wood was also featured. These are the stars of that precious Golden Age of Hollywood. A great DVD to give as a gift to your movie buff friends!,1395619200,,329,3.925373134328358

5361318,5,B009RJRJ2C,"Don't know what quality problems the first reviewer had, the DVD I have looks fine...Sounds like the customer got a defective disc and it should be returned for replacement, rather then writing a negative review. This Documentary is really neat, it covers a lot of facts and details many never knew about the stars, for instance, all the many bank accounts held by W,C. Fields...The naming of a condom after Rudolph Valentino greatest role ""The Sheik""...Bela Lugosi being buried in his Count Dracula outfit, including actual pix of him from the wake! More great footage includes an early rare appearance of Natalie Wood on the ""Perry Como Show"", Bela Lugosi on ""You Asked for it"", rare commercials with Steve McQueen and early footage of Marilyn Monroe as well as later footage of her funeral. There is also some very interesting footage of Rock Hudson, George Reeves (including some terrific Superman promos), and James Dean which includes footage of his wrecked car and that famous traffic safety promo shot days before his death. There is also interesting footage and tidbits regarding Sharon Tate, Tyrone Power and others...If anyone loves the classic stars and Hollywood's bygone era, they should enjoy this program.",1364947200,29,1221,5.11
