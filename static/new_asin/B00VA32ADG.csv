7084333,5,B00VA32ADG,"Hawaiians have respected and honored Transgender Individuals as part of their culture since the beginning of time. The Hawaiian language term is Mahu. The Mahu were so highly valued that they were designated as the Keepers and Teachers of Hawaiian Hula. They are still to this day entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining and teaching Hula.
  The heart of this story encompasses the struggles a Mahu Child faces in Western influenced Hawaii today and the much needed support he receives from his Hula Teacher, Kumu Hina.
  This movie was so heartfelt on many levels along with being culturally educational that it is one of my favorite documentaries to this day. I would recommend this movie for adults, children, and better yet to sit down as a family and experience this very personal and beautiful story.",1438300800,3,815,5.014814814814815
7084334,5,B00VA32ADG,"This is a very moving film that will open your eyes to Polynesian culture and the transgender community.

8709695,5,B00VA32ADG,"It is refreshing as a lesbian to see homosexuality being accepted and even celebrated in another culture. Just becuase gay marriage was passed in the U.S., people think homophobia is over. Homophobia is actually rising. It was rising when SSM was passed. The law didn't pass by public opinion; it passed because a couple liberal SC justices rammed it through. Public support for SSM was teetering at 50% when it was passed. It really is embarrassing this day in age.

Anyway, I loved learning about ""mahu"" and was just enchanted by little Ho anani (I know I probably messed up that spelling). I feel like sometimes the LGBT doesn't have a future. We read the statistics about how so few groups support gay rights, and how those few that do are not seeing population growth. But, seeing this beautiful film gives me hope.",1494547200,,820,4.734265734265734
8709696,5,B00VA32ADG,"Loved all the cultural factors associated with this story.  This is most notable in understanding how often folks from dominant culture have and continue to outlaw cultural traditions and practices which are deemed ""outside the norm.""  Kumu Hina tells the powerful story of a soul unbound by stereotypes and misconceptions that often foreclose on opportunities for authenticity.  Instead, telling the real and raw story of one person within the context of one's own cultural experience where nuance is not only welcomed but encouraged.",1478995200,2,535,5.421686746987952
