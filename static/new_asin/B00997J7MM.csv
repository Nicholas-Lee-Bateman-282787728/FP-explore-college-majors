5283633,5,B00997J7MM,"This DVD is of a very good quality, not what one would normally expect from a `third world nation' - the images are genuine, crisp and clean, no shaky camera images.  This is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD collection on nature and wildlife.

Trinidad & Tobago is blessed with much plant and animal life that needs to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy - very informative and educational.  The four (4) episodes on this DVD are the Caroni Swamp, Mangroves, Avian Wonders, and Forest Fires.  This DVD is the perfect gift for any nature lover or advocate on conserving environment.",1352332800,,610,4.836538461538462
5283634,5,B00997J7MM,"Kudos to Idiom Productions for producing this - for my part, long awaited - quality DVD, which is hopefully the first of many in the Bush Diary series. The packaging in which the DVD arrives includes a detailed guide of the four episodes it contains: Caroni Swamp, Mangroves, Avian Wonders, and Forest Fires.

This informative and beautifully filmed DVD highlights the rich biodiversity of the twin-island republic of Trinidad & Tobago. It is my hope that the obvious passion for nature of the small but dedicated production team will encourage viewers to want to learn more about wildlife, whether in Trinidad & Tobago or elsewhere, and to also develop an interest in conservation.

This Bush Diary DVD will be a worthwhile addition to any DVD collection.",1352073600,,756,4.992063492063492
5283635,5,B00997J7MM,I commend the work of the Idiom team in producing this first DVD.  It is full of information that is useful for the avid naturalist as well as persons seeking more information on Trinidad and its natural beauty.  I am eagerly awaiting the next collection...,1352073600,,257,4.688888888888889
5283636,5,B00997J7MM,I congratulate Robert Clarke and the team at Idiom Productions on their masterpiece. Bush Diary has taught me things I did not know about the habitats and people of my country. I anxiously await future volumes.,1351987200,,210,4.861111111111111
5283637,4,B00997J7MM,"HI
 I am a proud Trini and prouder of the young persons that took the time and made the effort to produce these items about our country and the beauty of its nature. I am not sure how many of our children would get to experience this nature first hand as many in my generation have but thanks for documenting so candidly the state of things. The authentic feel is not imagined and Mr Clarke is real - crisp and not heavily accented other than Trinbagonian which is a good look
Well done folks.",1351209600,2,493,4.24468085106383
8538005,2,B00997J7MM,Thi is a labor of love and deserving of the resources  to be so much better. Only a fraction of bird species and wildlife to be found are shown and often when shown the narrator does not identify them!  Appropriate for junior high level with emphasis on importance of preserving important habitats. Certainly not worth the price,1518480000,,328,4.7368421052631575
8538006,2,B00997J7MM,"This is an amateur production which in my opinion is poorly written, produced and presented.  Of all the beauty of T&T, this video just skims the surface with poor scripting and  poor photography.  When you consider the possibilities of a video on the nation, this product does not come close.",1477958400,,293,4.82
8538007,5,B00997J7MM,"I am biased.  The authors of the series, Bush Diary Collection, were patients of mine as children.  They have grown up and produced a first class, genuine, locally made product.  It is beautifully filmed and professionally narrated and while the stars of the series undoubtedly are the Great Houses and leatherback turtles, there are enough vistas of lonely beaches, pounding waves, cocoa pods in verdant estates (mostly abandoned), a payhut (check it out to see what that as), Demerara windows, boot scrapers, breadfruit, coconuts around the Savannah, congarees and the occasional corbeaux to keep one interested in the background.  Whilst mainly concerned with animals and inanimate objects (the Great Houses), there are tantalising glimpses of locals passing by.  There is even what looks like a staged scene (the only one!) of a man ""dancing the cocoa"" that wonderfully fits into the narrative of the Great Houses.  The DVDs come with a delightful little booklet that explains a great deal more than can be said here.  This is a good buy.  It makes a refreshing introduction to Trinidad and should be in the briefcase of anyone coming to or interested in our island, Trinidad.",1473120000,,1180,5.077720207253886
8538008,5,B00997J7MM,"My husband and I bought this as we thought it'll be great for our kids in school.....we were definitely not disappointed!
AMAZING in a word!
Really brings Trinidad & Tobago to the world in all its glory and wonder! Well researched. Well written. Truly a masterpiece!!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",1472083200,,290,5.0625
8538009,5,B00997J7MM,"Hi there,
I'm Trinidadian and have an awesome love for my island. I happened to come across the trailer for Bush Diary Collection 1 and contacted Idiom production.  I spoke to Paolo who informed me that the 2nd Bush Diary was available and then later, that I might be interested in The Road Less Travelled. Their prompt response led to a personal delivery of my DVDs by no less than Paolo Kernahan himself.  Needless to say I purchased them all, yay!

Oh how pleasantly surprised I was when I opened the beautiful package and found brilliant videography - no shaky camera and wonky angles.  Even though Robert  Clark repeats often in the videos, that they had a small budget, the end-product was excellent! The videography was excellent.  Their passion for nature/conservation is contagious and comes right at you through the television.  My own passion for exploring my beloved island was re-ignited.  I truly appreciated the risk this band of brothers took in going to the Beetham multiple times to ""get the shot"" because everytime we drive by that area, I would look longingly, knowing full well that I would never risk going myself.

The segment on the Claxton Bay Mangroves was inspiring.  Who knew that you could actually replant a mangrove? Over the last few years when I would take Trini friends to visit the temple in the sea, I observed some curious activity along this coastline using bamboo and used tyres. Now I know what was being done. They are used to make nurseries for regrowing the mangroves that have been lost. How heartening and inspiring. I am quite proud of the dedicated souls who have been working assidiously on such an important project.

In the segment on the Caroni Swamp, I was absolutely beside myself when they found the silky anteater and then completely overjoyed that what they had found and filmed was the rare occurance of finding an adorable baby anteater clinging to the parent.  I've visited Mt. Saint Benedict and said prayers a few times there, walked along the grounds but never knew about the bird watching at Pax Guest house. This too is something new that I have learnt.

This Bush Diary DVD Collection 1 and Collection 2 plus The Road Less travelled by Paolo Kernahan make excellent gifts for friends and loved ones away from home.  Schools should be purchasing them also as they are excellent tools for educating and engendering a love for country and inspiring concious efforts to raise conservation awareness in our future generations.

Thank you sooooo much for this venture folks,
Huge fan of your productions,
Keep on doing this invaluable work

8538010,5,B00997J7MM,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for my 8 yo daughter.  Her reaction shocked me - such genuine joy at receiving it!  We have looked at all the episodes and found them quite informative, we were able to see parts of our country that we did not know possessed such treasures.  I am very much looking forward to future DVDs and will definitely be starting a collection when then come out.  Great job, Idiom Team!",1358208000,2,414,4.337662337662338
8538011,5,B00997J7MM,"This is a wonderful DVD, well produced and very informative.  For anyone with even a slight interest in flora and fauna (not just in Trinidad) I would consider this DVD a necessary purchase.  I intend to get a few more copies to give to family and friends.",1357084800,2,256,4.425531914893617
8538012,5,B00997J7MM,Brilliant job! A must see for all nature lovers. Educational and should be bought by schools ! Great idea for Christmas gifts.,1353283200,2,126,4.7727272727272725
8538013,5,B00997J7MM,"I called this Review ""Our Bush Diary"" because if you lived in Trinidad it is your's as well as anyone's to be looked after as well as appreciated as some of the Trinidadian's are doing, I lived in Trinidad in 1955 to 1958 and 30 years later in 1988 I took my Wife and Two Sons back to have a fantastic 3 week holiday.. We saw almost all things that people do when visiting Trinidad..Now Robert Clarke presents Bush Diary which is a must for anyone who has lived there or may be going for a holiday..It takes you in to the areas that as a person you do not get to see apart from the organized Tourist trips on the mangroves etc..Collection One contains 4 episodes i.e. Caroni Swamp,Mangroves,Avian Wonders and Forest Fires..The story line is very good and explain's lot's about the subject being filmed to which the Videography is very very good indeed seeing that this was made on a small budget and only one camera it is amazing just what a good team can do..Host..Robert Clarke,Videography..Rajnauth Lal, Producers..Paolo Kernahan and Narrisa Mandol,Execcutive Producer..Paolo Kernahan..Running Timr 156 minutes and of course  the added Bonus Features...It is a great DVD and would recommend this to any one but most of all to any Trini,s living away from home this is a must to have...I felt after seeing this DVD that I had been back home for a short time..Loved every minute of it.. P.S. This DVD played on my Region Free DVD Player here in England and am told that it should play any where in the world....",1352592000,2,1512,4.6
8538014,5,B00997J7MM,"I am a Trinidadian living in the US for the last 18 years. I knew Robert WAY back when, and was interested to learn he had become an environmental journalist, and that he, along with Paolo Kernahan and Narrisa Mandol, were creating nature documentaries as part of a larger conservation effort in Trinidad. So as soon as Bush Diary became available on Amazon, I purchased it.

As a health journalist, I know how much effort goes into creating work like this -- and from the videography, to the narration/writing, to the research, all of it is excellent, and world class. My two favorite sections are ""Caroni Swamp"" (the surprise baby silky anteater is the cutest thing in the world!) and ""Mangroves."" I was sure these areas had changed significantly since my childhood, and I was curious to see how they had changed over time as Trinidad became increasingly developed. Busy Diary didn't fail me when it came to providing me that information: Clearly lots of research was done to get facts and statistics that emphasized the demise of the Caroni Swamp and the mangroves and how vital it was to conserve these areas. What's more, everyone interviewed (for example, Winston Nanan of Nana's Caroni Bird Sanctuary) was a wealth of knowledge.

Robert's an excellent host too: In terms of his personality, there's just enough daring and excitement to pique the viewer's interest - a little bit of Steve Irwin, but...um...without the death by stingray. He also speaks clearly without too heavy of a Trinidadian accent, making the information accessible to people everywhere.(Hey, if my New Jersey Italian husband who says things like ""bada bing bada boom"" with no irony at all can understand Robert, trust me when I say it means Robert does a great job.)

This series doesn't need to stay limited to Trinidad or the Caribbean. This is a must-watch for anyone with a passion for the environment, conservation, or environmental journalism. Bird-watchers anywhere in the world would love this too, with so much focus on the stunning birds of the island.",1352419200,3,2041,4.9273255813953485
