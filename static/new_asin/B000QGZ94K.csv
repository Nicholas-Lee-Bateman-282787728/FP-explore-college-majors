Considering most people who are fat cannot stick to their diet and fail, I can see what Susan is doing, she is reinforcing techniques to help people get control of their mental problem with not being able to stick to a diet.  Susan is telling the truth, weight loss really starts between the ears.  If you cant get your head in the right place, and control your eating, there is no workout program on the planet that will get you thin.  Weight loss starts in the kitchen.  80% of weight loss is food intake. not hours of working out doing some exercise video... Watch the movie FED UP and its all explained.  You have to walk 5 miles to burn off one cookie.  So these people who are fat and looking for the ""magic exercise program"" are spinning their wheels and will stay fat until they get real",1484870400,2,824,4.417218543046357

8196464,5,B000QGZ94K,"The only problem I see with her newer (circa 2000) audio DVD's is they repeat themselves. I'd rather see her take all of the good points she has written over the past 20 years of her career and put them on the motivation DVD's. We get it, you have to do it to be motivated to start and continue to diet, and exercise and make the changes in your thinner life everlasting. But, this DVD just lacks something. It rambles on, repeating the same points. Buy it of you can get it cheap. There are two of them Motivation 1 AND Motivation 2. And I duplicate the reviews for both of them.
