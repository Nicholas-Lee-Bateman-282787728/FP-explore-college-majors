The text and content is adapted to a child's needs so they can enjoy the beauty and understand the dialogue at the same time. The cinematography is absolutely stunning!!!!  After the movie was over they interviewed the people who were involved in making this film. Some of the techniques were state of the art. There is one scene in the film where the cameramen are hanging above Victoria Falls so you really feel like your  floating down Victoria Falls, this felt wonderful.  A person needs to experience this on the big screen to really feel the full effect of this film. I would highly recommend this movie for families with children. As and adult I would have enjoyed it more if the content in the screenplay had allowed for more scientific information. I also felt the movie was to short but it's a type of movie that you never want it to end. It's a very pleasurable experience for everyone.",1439683200,,1064,4.6436170212765955

If you want to see animals, plant life, sea creatures, and every other aspect of this planet in a way that will blow your mind, check out Enchanted Kingdom.  I've never seen anything like it!",1439337600,2,249,4.767441860465116
6735584,5,B00ODYJTD8,"This film is unbelievable! Absolutely stunning, BBC Earth has done it, captured the most amazing footage all over Africa. The Victoria Falls shot was incredible, how they did it - I don't know. It is definitely a film you can't miss, if you love the mysteries of Africa you have to watch this... and I just finished watching it and can't wait to show my friends. Don't miss this one!",1439251200,2,383,4.485714285714286

8683322,5,B00ODYJTD8,"I got this because it's one of the few movies with a Dolby Atmos soundtrack that isn't all about the ending or the effects.

It's one of the most continuous and varied uses of 11 channel (a speaker in every corner and then some) I've heard to date and works well, wind, rain, rushing water, animals, everything is well located.  I was literally surrounded in sound the entire time.

The other reviewers sum up the visual and flow aspects nicely and glowingly which it deserves.

I almost gave it 4 stars because I normally reserve 5 for my favorite movies ever.  It's not one of my favorite movies ever.  Its very good.",1496966400,,619,4.482142857142857
8683323,5,B00ODYJTD8,"Love, love, love!
Maybe the best part of the video is that when you knew one animal killed and devoured another, it wasn't shown.
Lovely cinematography and beautiful animals.",1486598400,,174,5.0344827586206895
