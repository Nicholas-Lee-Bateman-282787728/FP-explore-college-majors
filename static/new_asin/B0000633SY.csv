1687052,4,B0000633SY,"This film's own introduction as a psychological drama says it all as far as I'm concerned.  It depicts very powerfully how some men easily fall victim to being manipulated and dominated by emotionally disturbed women to the point of committing suicide or becoming alcoholic, and anyone with some life and people experience will recognize these things which happen around us all too often.  I found that the frequent scenes of the ""fool's"" wife and playful small child (which some think were superfluous) showed poignantly what he had sacrificed and lost, and the ending was equally heart-wrenching.  For anyone who appreciates true psychological drama about real-life situations and understands them well, this old film will not disappoint, despite some poor picture quality at times.  I felt that Theda Bara played her part extremely well: more than just a 'vamp' who leads men astray, but also the cold-hearted, angry, bossy woman who typically has control over certain types of men and is so emotionally detached that she doesn't care what happens to them later.  Another interesting aspect is this window into the past showing people's manner and behaviour nearly a century ago, and also showing that psychological problems were perhaps better understood in the past than we realize.  Being a 1915 production, it isn't as smooth and sophisticated as films of the 1920s, and it might require a little extra effort to read and understand the texts, and keep up with the somewhat rough editing, but for the story, its content and message, I think it rates highly overall.  Add to that the special features on this DVD which explain how Theda Bara's image was 'created' in order to attract viewers and put the focus on her - something that hasn't changed in Hollywood over the century!  So whether you like the psychological angle or the allurement of Theda Bara, this movie is still well worth watching.",1085529600,9,1904,5.022222222222222
1687053,4,B0000633SY,"It would be a major stretch to describe ""A Fool There Was"" as a good film, but for all sorts of reasons it remains full of interest. The plot is utter nonsense, some garbage about an evil woman who has nothing better to do than destroy the lives of wealthy men. Exactly how she achieves this is never made clear, but apparently arching the back and flaring the nostrils was carried some clout in 1915.
We shouldn't get too superior about it though. The public for whom this movie was made was by no means as naive as we might like to think. The film was camp then, just as it is now, though they probably had a different word for it. It was clearly a less permissive society. What passed for ""sin"" isn't at all recognisable as such today. And in fact as a primary source you couldn't find a better social commentary than ""A Fool There Was"". For instance it is interesting that a conspicuous display of feminine ambition and sexuality had automatically to be branded ""evil"" - it would take decades for this perception to be reversed.
Much of the focus will be on Theda Bara. With so little of her output available for viewing today its unfortunate to have to say that this is far from representative. What is clear is that she was a credible actor - not immediately apparent from her still photographs - capable of restraint as well as frenzy. Her fame is much easier to understand when she is actually seen in action. She has considerable poise and presence and when well lit and photographed is surprisingly beautiful.
The DVD issue is exceptionally well presented - the menus are imaginative and atmospheric, the extras well chosen and interesting. The print is variable; here and there it is mottled and jittery, but more often the image is crisp and sharp and revelatory for those of us who know the film solely from pirated VHS copies. An appropriate music score is also a huge advantage.
In all, an unexpectedly compelling and thought provoking film, if not always for the reasons that were intended. And if you are disposed towards silent movies, a compulsory addition to the collection.",1020297600,28,2094,4.616621983914209
1687054,4,B0000633SY,"""A Fool There Was"" is based upon a stage play dealing with the subject of forbidden desires. I agree with the other reviews that Theda Bara (in her film debut) is the reason to watch this film.  The film has been lovingly restored (having some cracking in places) with original tints and the overall quality is excellent.  The piano score is perfect for the film.
As one would expect, the acting in this 1915 feature is old-fashioned.  People endlessly shake hands on meeting and parting.  Perhaps this is a reflection of the polite manners of the time but after several scenes with this kind of repetition it was laughable.  ""A Fool There Was"" has the flavor of a social commentary with overtones of forbidden sex.  Lust is something to be avoided; else you fall into the snares of female vampires. By our standards today, the film stretches credulity.  John Schuyler, Theda Bara's principle victim, presents quite a contrast.  First, he is an upright family man and is selected as an ambassador to Great Britain.  On meeting the vamp, he descends into a drunken ruin.  How the vamp gains control over Schuyler is not told (missing footage?) and is a done deal.  John Schyler's wife is a martyr, who suffers from her husband's fall but is powerless to do anything.
Theda Bara's vampire character exudes a hypnotic influence over everyone.  The men under her power are utterly helpless in her presence, lending her a supernatural aspect.  Even when the wife and a family friend come to reclaim the errant husband and father, they cower in the presence of the vamp and Schuyler becomes a jelly.  One might expect the vamp to get her just deserts but she remains victorious.  Perhaps this serves as a further warning that the vamp remains on the loose.
The film is fun as a social history and for Bara's performance, one of the few remaining.  Anyone who loves the silent cinema will want a copy.",1020211200,7,1894,4.711246200607903
1687055,4,B0000633SY,"No, this does not refer to the 1944 thriller starring Bela Lugosi (a neat little thriller by the way) but rather to the original screen vampire Theda Bara. Her 1915 film A FOOL THERE WAS launched a revolution in the motion picture industry and introduced the word vamp (as noun and verb) into the American vocabulary where it referred to a predatory woman until the advent of Lugosi's DRACULA in 1931. Here was a woman who knew what she wanted, went out and got it, and suffered no consequences for it. The film made an overnight star of Bara and made William Fox's film outfit a major player in early Hollywood. They would later become 20th Century Fox and today's Fox TV network.

Theda Bara was born Theodosia Goodman in Cincinatti. Her screen name, cooked up by Fox's publicity department, is an anagram for Arab Death. She was the biggest early silent female star but her films have rarely been seen as most were destroyed in a Fox warehouse fire. While A FOOL THERE WAS is not her best film, it remains a fascinating glimpse of her and of the morality of early Hollywood. A poem by Rudyard Kipling which became a play was the basis for this film which portrays the decline and fall of a prosperous lawyer who leaves wife and child to be with a worldly woman who proceeds to literally drain him of everything he possesses (hence the term vampire) until he dies a broken man while she crushes flower petals over his lifeless body. Strong stuff for 1915 and the forerunner of every woman takes man away from wife scenario that would follow. While the stylised acting may seem silly and overblown remember that we're dealing with archetypes carried over from 19th century melodrama. What makes it so fascinating today is the unhappy ending and the lack of moral retribution. Although Bara dominates the screen, the charecter of John Schuyler as played by Edward Jose' manages to stick with you as you watch him slide (very quickly) into total degradation.

The print utilized for this DVD is from the Killiam Collection. It is tinted and toned with much greater picture clarity than the old VHS transfer once available although there are still a few rough spots. The piano score by Phil Carli is appropriately downbeat and effective helping to make the histrionics more believable. When a film is this old it literally becomes a window into a bygone era. That and the superb transfer make the DVD of A FOOL THERE WAS worth owning especially for silent film buffs. Now if Kino can just get Fox and the Killiam Collection to issue a restored version of SUNRISE.",1017619200,47,2561,4.663716814159292
1687085,3,B0000633SY,"I don't know what to say about this one. First it loads and an annoying song penetrates the room...Then the same annoying song is used for the first 3-4 minutes of the movie...I had to turn it down...I mean right down...I thought not this noise for the whole movie!!!?  Thankfully the song ended, but the annoying song penetrated my thick skull and I found myself whistling it later. Grrr. Thankfully normal silent movie music took over after about 4 minutes. I don't recall if it was particularly good or if I was just relieved the annoying song ended.
  Though the text cards were fine, the quality of the reproduction was either too fuzzy or the text of the telegrams and letters in the movie was just too small, as I could barley read 5 words in the inserted letters or telegrams....they were just impossible to read. And there were enough of them that they were presumably somewhat important to the story. We just had to assumed we got the idea of what they said...eventually.
  The editing was below average...I found myself saying what happened a few times as either we had to catch up or figure out stuff that I think the editors assumed we got.
  The story I thought was too unbelievable, particularly considering how nasty Theda Bara acted. I didn't get a glimpse of anything in her demeanor (real or acted) that would justify her men falling so stupidly for her, enabling her to take them for all they were worth and ruining their lives. How on earth this movie made this girl a star afterwards I can't imagine...I would have pushed her aside, hopefully into a wet ditch. I have to think because of the early 1914 date, that this somehow seemed dramatic compared to other offerings of the time. But I can think of a few examples from this same period that far exceeded this in overall quality... so I'm stumped. Then the ending was so abrupt, I thought.. Huh?...that's it?!? Frankly I think the movies was barely a 2 1/2 star ..maybe even a two.
  Thankfully there was a bonus feature. a 25 minute romp through a nutty sultans Harem called ""the Sultan's Wife"". It was silly and typical of a Silent comedy. It wasn't particularly great, or imaginative, but it was fun...and a relief from what I thought was a dismal feature movie.",1422230400,,2240,4.593984962406015
1687086,5,B0000633SY,"I was very surprised at the unglamorous face of Theda Bara.  She was very young but not ravishing and maybe not even a great actress, in this film? I have not read any past or modern reviews of this film.

However, she was young and cute. Very petite. It's truly hard to determine if she was a great actress, because the film is SILENT!

It's also hard to judge anyone's acting from this time period, the acting is in their costumes, their expressions and movements.
(YES!!! I knew it was a SILENT film) before I purchased. The costumes are lavish and quirky (by our standards). The sets are glittery and fabulous.

I think that these old films have much to teach us, about life and freedom of expression, about costuming and society in a time when going to the movies for a nickel or a dime, was BIG, BIG deal! Society, was different in many ways in this time period.

No US income taxes, fur wearing was acceptable (especially MONKEY FUR!), animal species were thought of as unlimited. Women's rights were not really a big deal to many people, the cuckolded women with cheating husbands had very little legal recourse. Children, were pretty seen and not heard. Wealth, in these old, old movies seemed to be free flowing and unending, as well.

The Vampire, is a fun, old film for a rainy day. The sets and the romance of the movie are over the top, the costumes are wonderful!

Miss Bara, is glamorous and brazen, a real temptress to the hapless men in the story. Romanticism, wealth, and fabulous costumes and gorgeous, long old cars.

1687126,3,B0000633SY,"Theda Bara, the first onscreen sex symbol and the woman who defined the word ""Vamp"" in early cinema.

""A Fool There Was"", the 1915 silent film launched Theda Bara's career and made enough money for William Fox to create the Fox Film Corporation and a film that would popularize the slang term ""vamp"" as a sexually driven female predator who preys on a man.

""A Fool There Was"" is a film that is based on a play by Porter Emerson Brown, in which the play was based on Rudyard Kipling's poem titled ""The Vampire"".  The poem was read to the audience before the screening and the intertitles are literally Kipling's poem.  Because the film pays tribute to the poem, the main character played by Theda Bara is known as ""The Vampire"" and thus the film is cited as the first female ""Vampire"" movie.

Needless to say, with Theda Bara's role as ""The Vampire"" captured the viewer's attention, many started to pay attention to her name as rumors ran rampant that the Theda's name was a play on the word ""death"" and her last name is ""Arab"" backwards (the truth is that ""Theda"" is short for Theodosia and Bara is a shortened name for a relative's family name ""Barranger"").  But Bara would use the popularity of the film and the rumors to further stoke the mysterious side of her as her earlier photos would feature the sexy actress taking photos with a skeleton.

Unfortunately, because FOX lost nearly 90% of their silent films due to a nitrate fire, many of Theda Bara's films are lost but fortunately KINO VIDEO released ""A Fool There Was"" on DVD and giving silent film fans a chance to see Hollywood's first sex symbols in camera.

""A Fool There Was"" is a film about a woman (played by Theda Bara) who uses wealthy men and manipulates them to get what she wants and literally sucks them dry (hence the name ""The Vampire"").  Having corrupted many men and leaving them with nothing or using them until she feels the need to move on to her next prey, she targets Wall Street lawyer John Schuyler (played by Edward Jose).

Schuyler has everything going for him.  A good family, a loving wife and daughter, a great job and home and he was recently appointed by the President of the United States as a special envoy to settle claims with Great Britain.

Although with a wealthy man, the Vampire has decided that she needs a new prey and leaves her current man to go after a more wealthy man in power.

While Schuyler is unable to bring his family along with him, he takes off on the big ship ""the Gigantic"" and from that moment, The Vampire has her sights targeted on her prey and sure enough, using her sexual charm, she captures his attention.

Fast forward two months later and the two are now a couple.  Schuyler's family does not know the true reason why he hasn't return back home but when family friends visiting Italy spot Schuyler together with the Vamp, they realize that the man that many looked up to is having an affair.  To make things worse, the paparazzi has reported the affair in a newspaper and Mrs. Schuyler learns for her friends that the newspaper gossip was true.

While Mrs. Schuyler and a family friend do what they can to get close to Schuyler and bring him home, we start to see the change in the lawyer as the man that was full of energy has changed to a man whose hair has turned white, has been ostracized by his friends and his colleagues, lost his job, turned him to an alcoholic and for the most part, the Vampire is succeeding in sucking him dry.

But Mrs. Schuyler and a family friend are determined in saving Mr. Schuyler...but will it be too late?

VIDEO:

""A Fool There Was"" is color tinted and presented in 1:33:1.  Amazingly, for a 95-year-old film, ""A Fool There Was"" looks very good on DVD.  I was expecting some major damage to the original negative but interestingly, aside from occasional scratches and dust, the film looks very good for its age.  Granted, it's not super clear with a high amount of detail but compared to many other silents I have seen, the fact that there is no major nitrate warping or degradation.

AUDIO & INTERTITLES:

""A Fool There Was"" features a piano score by Phil Carli which is a very well-done score that was appropriate for this silent film.

Intertitles were easy to read (Note: These were not the original intertitles from 1915 but utilizing a much easier to read intertitles which were probably based on the original version with the dust and scratches added afterward).  It is important to note that the intertitles are from Rudyard Kipling's poem ""The Vampire"" and there are no dialogue-based intertitles.  So, one will not be reading as much throughout this film.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""A Fool There Was"" comes with the following special features:

  * Complete Text of Rudyard Kipling's ""The Vampire"" - The complete text presentation of Kipling's ""The Vampire"" which the film is based on and read before the film was screened.
  * Excerpt from Terry Ramsaye's ""A Million and One Nights"" - An excerpt of the popularity of Theda Bara and how she was hired as the lead actress for the film and the popularity that ensued right after and what people thought her name was about.
  * 1915 Review - A review for ""A Fool There Was"".
  * Photo Gallery - Featuring a few of the surviving photos of actress Theda Bara.

EXTRAS:

An insert with the chapter listings and a Fox Film Corporation image (on the insert) of Theda Bara lying with a skeleton is included.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When ""A Fool There Was"" was screened in theaters, people were read the original poetry of ""The Vampire"" and knew immediately that if the film followed the poem closely, one was prepared for a film that may not have a happy ending.

The film was straight-forward to tell a story of a vamp and how she has hurt many men in the process by leaving them, taking their money and in some cases, leading these men to self-destruction.  This is a woman who is literally amoral and all she cares about is dominating the man, getting her way with him, having him do what she says and even if it destroy his career or his life (making them an alcoholic), she could care less.  If she gets bored, she can move on to another man (leaving them in a bad state) and destroy the next man she comes in contact with.

Because this is during the time when filmmakers were trying to find ways to tell a feature-length story, you're going to have some unusual pacing issues.  But for ""A Fool There Was"", the pacing wasn't bad at all.  If anything, what I found quite interesting is how they utilized Schuyler's young daughter as a way to make the film lighthearted (during her scenes) and happy, while the storyline is literally about a vamp destroying the man.

The storytelling is quite simplistic and were common for silent films during this period in time but the story is easy to follow and understand.  But with that beings said, you're not going to see how far the vamp goes to seduce a man, there are no sexual scenes aside from a couple kissing and there is no ""Fatal Attraction"" style of storyline where you will see Mrs. Schuyler doing all she can to save her marriage away from the Vampire. Granted, that would have made a fantastic storyline but if anything, what viewers get is a direct adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's poem ""The Vampire"" for a feature length silent film.

But ""A Fool There Was"" is an important film for silent film fans.  From what it did for Theda Bara and William Fox's career but the fact that there are not many Theda Bara films that have survived, this 1915 film is probably one of the earliest full-length silent films that looks good on DVD and its contribution to American pop culture by popularizing the slang word ""Vamp"" for that era and the film is the first depiction of a female vampire in film.

The DVD from Kino Video is worth it if you are a hardcore silent film fan but storywise, it's not the greatest nor is it the worst.  It's just an average film at best.  The fact that this surviving Theda Bara film looks good on DVD and we are provided with a few text-based special features is a plus.  Personally, the fact that there aren't many Theda Bara films available, I'm just happy that Kino Video did release this on DVD for silent film fans and we can say that we have a Theda Bara film in our silent film collection.

Overall, ""A Fool There Was"" is a film that showcased one of America's earliest and popular sex symbol Theda Bara, a film which would feature the first female ""vampire"" and a successful film that gave William Fox the opportunity to create the Fox Film Corporation.  If you are a silent film fan, because of the rarity of Theda Bara films, this 1915 silent film is definitely recommended to have in your silent film collection but if you are a casual silent film fan, ""A Fool There Was"" is an average silent film at best.",1282003200,11,8802,4.516719242902208
1687127,5,B0000633SY,"I am giving the movie 4 stars, but the DVD 5.  The total is 4.5, but I am rounding it up.

Is it wrong to like a person without knowing their work?  I became a fan of Theda Bara's image without seeing any of her work.  Then again, I knew that most of her work was destroyed in a fire.  But ""A Fool There Was"" was the only movie of her's that I could find.  I really wanted to see Theda on the screen.

The movie is pretty good.  I love silent movies.  They are a favorite genre of mine.  I love how it doesn't have a happy ending.  I hate happy endings.  They can be so unrealistic.  And I like the plot as well.  Though it is very short, clocking in at a little over an hour.  The costumes of the Edwardian Age that Theda wears are great.

The DVD also has great feature.  Be sure to check those out.

I am also a fan of the poem and picture that accompany this movie.  I have the picture as a poster on my wall.

The DVD seems kind of expensive, but I'm sure it is worth it.  I do not own the DVD, only rented it.  I plan to buy it, and will fill in the blank spaces I left.

But if first impressions matter, this DVD is worth it.  The movie is entertaining, and the features are really great.",1255392000,4,1195,3.863070539419087
1687128,5,B0000633SY,"A Fool There Was features great acting by the entire cast and the plot moves along very nicely. The cinematography works quite well in the shots where we see the cars going around the streets of Manhattan; and the choreography also works very well in scenes where several actors had to be within the camera frame at once. Despite the fact that this film was produced almost a century ago, many parts of this story could still happen today. The film was restored in 1982 but it still could use some work in certain spots; but then again after a fire destroyed most of Theda Bara's films I suppose we're fortunate that this film still exists at all.

When the action starts we quickly meet prosperous New York City Wall Street lawyer John Schuyler (Edward Jos). He has his own yacht and his family adores him. His wife, Kate (Mabel Frenyear) and daughter (Runa Hodges) turn in great acting performances as the perfect loving wife and child who yearn for him and love him unconditionally.

Things are going well for John--so well, in fact, that the American government employs him as a special envoy to Great Britain on the eve of World War One. John and his family are thrilled for him; but after his sister-in-law gets injured in a car accident John's wife and daughter cannot sail with him to England. John feels badly about it; but duty calls. He departs New York's harbor and is quickly caught by the ""vamp"" (short for vampire) who is played by Theda Bara.

It doesn't take long, either, before the vamp ""helps"" John to forget about his vows to his wife; and he certainly doesn't worry much about his daughter, either. We see the vamp and John relaxing at a fancy resort in Italy; but things start to go sour when John is spotted by an acquaintance from New York. She won't even stay at the same hotel with John because she is disgusted by his behavior!

Of course, as time wears on, John becomes more and more absorbed and consumed by the vamp. We see him keeping her as his ""mistress"" in his Manhattan townhouse which is safely out of the way of his family's home in Larchmont, New York. He spends money--a lot of money--on the vamp and this slowly but surely drives John into tough times at work John begins to drink way too much as well.

John's wife Kate wants him back--but will he take her back? Kate even tries bringing their daughter to John in his townhouse to remind him of a good reason why they should at least try to work things out. Kate doesn't want a divorce; she wants John--but will she eventually decide divorce is better? And what about the vamp--will she relinquish John at the last minute when she's drained him for all he's got, or will she not care at all and throw him into the wind? Watch and find out!

A Fool There Was shines bright with great performances by all, especially Theda Bara who is perfectly cast as the vamp. The DVD comes with a few extras including the complete text of Rudyard Kipling's ""The Vampire"" and a ""1915 review."" I highly recommend this film for fans of Theda Bara and silent movies; people interested in silent film drama would also do well to add this to their collections.",1243123200,3,3131,4.493848857644991
1687129,4,B0000633SY,"Theda Bara was not the first femme fatale in the movies, but as ""The Vampire"" in A FOOL THERE WAS she was the first to portray a seductress modeled explicitly on the bloodsucking vampires of story and legend.  (Coincidentally, Louis Feuillade's LES VAMPIRES came out the same year. Though Musidora, in a skintight black leotard, imbued the fiendish Irma Vep with a provocative sensuality, the title of the French serial referred not to seductive women but to a Parisian gang of criminal masterminds.)  The vamp would devolve into parody before the end of the silent era, but in 1915, with audiences transfixed by Theda Bara, she could do no wrong by doing men wrong.

Certain facts must be accepted without question, of course, for audiences to remain transfixed.  These facts are no more or less believable than the standard issue assumptions about garlic and crosses and bats that govern movies about ""real"" vampires.  One such fact is that all women can spot a vamp a mile off, but few men can.  The primary victim, John Schuyler (Edward Jose), is not obtuse; he's simply male--in other words, made to order.

He's also wealthy, which helps.  But it isn't only money that the vamp is after, or she wouldn't work so diligently at destroying the source of the golden eggs.  Nor is it solely sex:  she renders her victims impotent, after all.  It is power she desires, the power to seduce, to enthrall, to possess, to empty, and to discard.  She is the ultimate consumer.

Dated as its trappings are, A FOOL THERE WAS is startlingly modern in its avoidance of sentimentality.  It teaches no lessons.  The vamp does not develop into a vamp; she's what she is when the story begins.  John Schuyler likewise does not choose to have an affair with her; he can't resist her charms.  Once under her spell, the victim has no will of his own.  Families and friends appeal to his humanity (the abandoned wife and daughter are trotted out) but in their presence the vamp draws Schuyler to her breast with the greatest of ease.  Unlike Victorian melodramas in which decent men are snared by drink (Timothy Shay Arthur's ""Ten Nights in a Bar Room,"" for instance), one cannot defeat the vamp by reformist means.  Only a stake through the heart would do it, and that's another movie.

If you've watched NOSFERATU, DRACULA, or VAMPYR, you'll certainly recognize the telltale signs of Schuyler's grim decline:  a hollow-eyed decrepitude brought on (presumably) by the vamp's insatiable desire for sex.  His moral decay is accompanied by the same physical decay that we associate with involuntary blood donations and pinholes in the neck.  Audiences expected it.  And loved it.

Not many extras on the disc, but there is a nice slideshow of photos of Theda Bara, both with and without her trademark mascara.  Philip Carli provides a lively piano score with little vamping.  Recommended.",1218326400,4,2869,4.847736625514403
1687130,5,B0000633SY,"for any fan of classic hollywood , this is a must for your dvd collection.

theda bara was the first-ever sex symbol of the cinema. with almost all of her films now lost, we mostly have photos of her. those iconic photos of her-- the bulging eyes rimmed all-around in black mascara,  her hands pulling on  her long black hair, the wild expressions on her face, the cleopatra circular breast plates!! one gets the impression of a plump 'lily munster'. from our modern viewpoint it's hard to take her seriously in these images.

when most film historians talk of her, they relate the incredible hype that surrounded bara and her films from 1915 to 1919, mostly dreamt up by her studio,fox pictures. a female vampire that sucks men dry. her name an anagram for 'arab death'. her belief in past lives. a famous story bara relates herself concerns her giving an apple to a young child who then recognizes her, screams 'it's the vampire!!', and runs away in horror.

she has been written about humorously, a bygone, repressed era's quaint way of dealing with sex.

so to now finally see bara on the screen in her first film is quite a revelation. in her first appearance in the film, she takes a long stem rose, breaks it off the stem, and drops the petals on the floor smiling at its destruction. bara has a shocking and commanding presence.

she is also quite pretty and natural in front of the camera. bara resembles elizabeth montgomery with black hair (for anyone who remembers montgomery's look in that ""twilight zone"" episode she did with charles bronson). there are a few scenes that take place in bara's bedroom, and she's quite lovely with her long, glossy black hair cascading down her back, and a nightgown that constantly slips off her shoulder as she moves about.

bara is a suprisingly powerful actress as well, as good as any modern actress of today. this is the biggest surprise of the film. no overacting or hair-pulling in this one. she gives a perfectly controlled, mezmerizing, detailed performance, with a couple of displays of fury that will make you jump!!

the film itself looks good for almost being 100 years old. my only complaint being there are no closeups of bara in the film. the closest we get to one is a head and shoulder shot of her. i believe dw griffith invented the closeup shot in his film ""birth of a nation"", which was released about the same time as this film.

all in all this is a very good film, and if this is the kernel on which the mighty bara myth grew, now i understand why.
the hype and hysteria that surrounded bara in 1915 must have been similar to the buzz and hysteria madonna caused in the eighties and nineties. and like madonna, i now see that theda bara had the talent to back up all the hype.",1169510400,5,2747,4.5425101214574894
1687131,4,B0000633SY,"A Fool There Was is based on a poem called ""The Vampire,"" a piece about and evil woman who corrupts innocent men to do her bidding. The vampire is Theda Bara; her name is an anagram for Arab Death. Although her real name is Theodosa and her image has been fabricated by studio publicity, the public is in awe of her, the first sex symbol whose pushy nature is absolutely unheard of at the time. She is thrilling and unique and a major star.

Unfortunately today, practically nothing exists of Bara's career. Only this early film and perhaps a few others exist for viewing. This is an adequate representation; it certainly emphasises her image. The Vampire is a gold digger who enjoys ruining the men she feeds on but keeping them loyal to her all the while. The particular man in this film is a family man with a gorgeous daughter and a devoted wife, but somehow, this Vampire is cunning enough to lure him away.

The story is not particularly interesting, but what is is watching Theda Bara. She has a quiet attraction with the audience, something very subtle but very inviting. From seeing pictures of her, one might expect that her acting would be overly exaggerated and strange, but it is not in the least. If anything, she is rather casual; it is the others in the film that overact.

I did not expect to like Theda Bara after seeing this film, but is left me sadly wishing that there were more films to see. Let her career stand as an example; we need to preserve the films we have left.",1152748800,2,1493,4.461538461538462
1687132,4,B0000633SY,"I bought this movie because it stars the great Theda Bara.  I had no idea what to expect because I just wanted to start watching some of the older silent movies.  This was actually very good.  I did have a little trouble following the storyline but that didn't really matter.  I was so captivated by Theda Bara!  There was one scene where she shows her ankle...how revealing for 1915!

The extras were disapointing, I was hoping for my photos of Theda Bara or a biography.

It is so interesting to see who they made movies at this time!",1122854400,4,536,4.408163265306122
1687133,4,B0000633SY,"This movie really isn't much to write home about, though one must consider that feature-length films were only a few years old in 1915 and just about every feature from the early and mid-Teens won't seem very complex or technically advanced by modern-day standards.  Unfortunately, the handful of surviving Theda Bara films seem to be unrepresentative of her true scope of talents and ability, although clearly one can tell, when seeing her in motion as opposed to those often ridiculous-looking publicity stills Fox Studios had her sit for, that she was quite talented and even beautiful, in an off-beat kind of way.  (I feel that 'The Unchastened Woman' is a slightly better film in terms of pacing and story development, though unless some of her more representative films are ever found, all we have to go by are the sub-par films that remain--those two, 'East Lynne,' half of the short film 'Madame Mystery,' and an early pre-stardom appearance in 'The Stain.')  This is the film that made her a star, that established the concept of the Vamp, the beautiful dangerous mysterious evil woman who uses power and sexuality to lure men to doom and destruction, laughing at her victims after they've run their course with her and she has no use or want for them anymore.

The story itself is little more than some Edwardian morality play; a dangerous woman who is interested in sex and therefore the dark side lures a series of men to rack and ruin; when she's finished she either coldly abandons them or they are too broken morally and physically to go on anymore, killing themselves or wasting away.  Most features in 1915 weren't that long, but given how many chunks of time are just glossed over with title cards such as ""Six months later,"" ""The next morning,"" and ""A week later,"" one can't help but feel that maybe there's some footage missing.  This leads to a feeling of uneven plot and character development.  Although as uneven as some of the pacing may feel to a modern audience, it is revolutionary in that the ""bad"" woman isn't punished for her actions, and there is no cheery happy moral ending that a lot of people of the time might have been accustomed to.  There wasn't as much screen time given to Theda as I would have liked, but when she is onscreen she's very good.  The extras are a bit skimpy but still interesting.",1122336000,3,2336,4.705882352941177
1687134,5,B0000633SY,"How can any movie staring Theda Bara get less than

100%?  I recomend this movie just to watch Theda in

action.  The clothes she wears are her own.  The scene

packing for the cruise ship while wearing a white night

gown is memorable!  The strap was loose and kept sliding

down while she packed.  She would yank it back up and you

could tell she was frustrated over it.  To her surprise, the

director refused to reshoot the scene.  There are other actors

in this film, but they pale beside Theda.  The scene in Italy,

where Theda was lounging outside on a chaise lounge and her

lover was leaning against her, drinking what she gave him.

The postman walked up with a letter and gave Theda a long

7958354,5,B0000633SY,"I'm kind of a brand-new fan of silent movies; however, one of the names I've always read about was Theda Bara. It always sounded intriguing and mysterious to me, and I guess that was exactly what they wanted 100 years ago. No matter how many articles I read nowadays about how artificial and pre-fabricated that ""product"" really was: she will always be the original movie Vamp to me, and I'm glad that the myth remains nowadays, after 100 years, and that she's still admired and regarded by many.

I had bought the Kino release of ""A Fool There Was"" the past last year, hoping to find out what was all the fuss about. Needless to say that I ended up becoming a huge fan of Theda Bara's charm and screen presence...

No, she wasn't conventionally beautiful nor even slender, and I'm sure these days many won't remotely understand why was she considered a sex-symbol. Sometimes even I wonder the same myself. But I guess it's something like an ""acquired taste"", or either you ""get"" it or you don't. In my case, I've only become a fan after watching her on screen, since the still always kept my wondering.  Those intriguing looks she gave may look kind of funny today, pretty much like anything silent to the regular viewer; but after a while into silents, you really learn to respect and appreciate those primitive works of the true pioneers.

This release by Grapevine Video is a cause for celebration to me. I used to think that only one movie of Theda Bara had survived, but now I'm so glad to realize I was wrong! Since I'm no expert (far from it), I'm not sure if the version of ""The Unchastened Movie"" is featured here in its entirety, since it runs less than 50 minutes, which was kind of short by 1925 standards. But, it doesn't seem to lack any relevant scene and the plot makes sense, without major gaps.

The story is quite simple and predictable, nothing special nor particularly memorable; however, at least to me, its historical value alone is worth 5 stars. Besides, it gives a slightly different Theda from her most famous movie made 10 years prior to this. She was 40 year-old at the time, and still looking great and very sexy in a ""healthy"" way. She still plays 'The Vamp' in some scenes, and of course that's what we expect from her, but here you can also see a more human side, and you can't help being on her side. Her face, especially those big, gorgeous eyes, was amazing, and still conveyed many feelings by the mid-'20s.

I have to be honest: I'm afraid I can only recommend this to the die-hard fan of Theda Bara. If you are one of them, you'll most likely already own ""A Fool There Was"" on your collection, that's why I'm not talking about it. (Honestly, I've only seen a few minutes of this Grapevine Edition, and I noticed it's beautifully tinted and with a nice print quality). My main reason to buy this was, of course, ""The Unchastened Woman"", since this is the only way to get it (that I know) and I'm not disappointed at all; quite on the contrary: the print quality is excellent, much better than I was expecting, rather clear and sharp most of the time.

I've read somewhere that the movie was supposed to be tinted, but I'm not sure about that. However, it looks beautiful in B&W all the same, and it doesn't take a bit off its charm. I honestly don't think you'll enjoy this if you're a casual fan of silent film (well, I hope I'm wrong!), or if you only enjoy big-budget productions. You won't find anything too fancy here, ""only"" the legendary and incomparable Theda Bara in her second surviving film... Certainly, a more than valid reason to me.",1425686400,3,3586,4.507692307692308
