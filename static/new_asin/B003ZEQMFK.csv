I highly recommend this box set.  Most people are familiar with ""Life"" and ""Nature's Most Amazing Events"", both of which are must-owns on Blu-Ray.  But the other two series, ""Yellowstone"" and ""South Pacific"", also have stunning cinematography and are worth a watch.

4233569,4,B003ZEQMFK,"The BBC sucked me in with their Planet Earth program when it first aired on American television.  On the strength of that product alone I went and purchased both of these BBC High-Definition Natural History Collections.  With both of them, the main feature (in this case, ""Life"") is obviously very well done and enjoyable to view.  The others are more 4 star quality programs and don't feel as satisfying as watching the main offering.

If you're into nature documentaries at all, the full set of Collection 1 and 2 may be an amazing start to your own disc based collection.",1308873600,8,574,4.71

4233576,5,B003ZEQMFK,"Great collection of 4 BBC Life productions. I won't go into all the details, as other reviewers have, but simply say that David Attenborough's voice could make anything seem interesting and amazing. If this comes up on sale (as it did for cyber monday this year), don't delay.",1358035200,,276,4.770833333333333
4233577,5,B003ZEQMFK,"Up to 37 inch screen size, these programs (video quality) blew me away, especially Life and Nature's Most Amazing Events.
Beyond 37 inches, the video quality at 40 plus inch screen, not so, but in my home, no one cared.
As to the complaints regarding 1080p and 1080i and 720p and no toilet paper in the bathroom...
Not everyone has to have a 70 inch plus size screen (even though some are dumb enough to buy DLP without asking about bulb life, costs after purchasing the tv, etc.), but one also has to research how the programs were recorded, edited, mastered, etc.
Gold Box deal at half price or better?
Very cool.
Get this!
Two personal notes:
1 - The purchase of Planet Earth as a stand-alone set vs. buying the BBC Collection 1 was fine with us,
2 - Life (with David Attenborough) in my opinion was ten-fold better than Oprah. Oprah needs to stick to her syndicated talk shows that she has now retired from, and perhaps pay attention to her failing (expensive to the cable and satellite viewer) OWN Network. Her version of Life proves this is not another career for her.
The BBC has to pay big bucks for David Attenborough, and they should as he is that good, but to get an American issue of Life and not pay the big bucks for David Attenborough has proven to be a huge mistake.",1337644800,,1282,4.413502109704641
4233578,5,B003ZEQMFK,"I have always been a fan of nature shows, and BBC continues to produce some of the best out there.  David Attenborough is one of the greatest nature show narrators, and you can tell he has a genuine interest in the material rather than just reads from a script.

The Life series has some great variety, and includes quite a lot of new footage compared to the Planet Earth series.  Also, unlike the Blu-ray version of Planet Earth, this set includes the 15-minute ""behind the scenes"" featurettes after each program.  Visual quality does vary a bit depending on what cameras they had to use, but the vast majority of the footage is crystal clear 1080p.

The other bundled programs are also worth watching.  This set is definitely worth owning for any nature lovers out there - especially if you can find it on sale.",1337644800,2,813,4.611111111111111
4233579,5,B003ZEQMFK,I am a huge fan of most of these BBC series and this one again delivers.  Amazing camera shots over and over again.  Buying it on Amazon was 1/3 of the price that all the stores charge.  This made it an amazing value as well.,1336867200,2,225,3.9555555555555557

This is a spectacular planet we live on and nature is more beautiful than anything else and the footage on these discs shows that brilliantly and ingeniously. Watching these blu-rays often makes me feel like a little kid, like I'm seeing and learning about the world and animals for the first time. I love this set and it doesn't have the audio glitch that the Planet Earth set I got has (read my review of Planet Earth for more info).",1329523200,2,558,4.480392156862745

The photography, music, and narration by Benedict Cumberbatch are simply top notch and very relaxing to watch. This series defines what heights TV can climb to.

These erudite narrators fit in nicely with David's deliberate, sometimes wry delivery. The cinematography is world-class, the audio quality & editing is outstanding & the content is breathtaking.
