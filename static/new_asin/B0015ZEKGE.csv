If you want nothing to do with Ecuador, you still might appreciate the funny dialogue and quirky characters, but you will be missing a lot of the fun.

I was torn between giving four or five stars.  I settled on five because I want to recommend the movie to more people.  I would say that the film was perfect in a way, but I know that many people who don't have my interest in Ecuador would find it a little dull.  Nothing momentous happens.  It's just quirky characters, funny dialog, beautiful scenery, and a very genuine look at life in Ecuador.

One thing you should know -- their plan to go from Quito to Cuenca in one day was ridiculous.  It always takes longer than that.  It isn't all that far, but the roads are terrible and it just takes forever to get around.",1238025600,,927,4.300578034682081

8260585,3,B0015ZEKGE,"Me parece un excelente pelicula, etretenida y divertida.
La razon por la cual le doy 3 estrellas es porque esta pelicula solo se puede ver con media pantalla y dos franjas negras, una arriba y otra abajo. Osea que no se puede ver en pantalla completa debido a la calidad en la que fue grabada.
Pero merece la pena verla, me gusto mucho.",1370563200,,336,4.349206349206349

8260587,4,B0015ZEKGE,"a film that just flows downriver, slowly and gracefully, and when it comes to the end you feel yourself wishing there was just a little more way to go.  It is an innocent film, filled with ordinary people living in the journey and not the destination and not even knowing it.  It isn't what I expected, but in the end it is just what you need!",1334448000,,343,4.181818181818182
8260588,5,B0015ZEKGE,"Xavier Donoso's review:

""Esperanza (""Hope""), a Spanish tourist girl, and Tristeza (""Sadness""), an Ecuadorian student, they met inside a bus going to Cuenca, city to which they want to arrive but motivated by different reasons. On the road they face with a national strike - blocking highways and roads. Both girls decide to continue the itinerary looking for somebody can take them at least to the nearest town. Through the travel they'll begin to know each other deeply, as well as they will know a little more Ecuador country and its people in a trip that it should last a few hours, but --the things of the life-- their destiny will be farest from it could seem.

'Qu tan Lejos' (How much Further) is a road movie created by Cuencan director Tania Hermida, who has been able to portrait Ecuador from an Ecuadorian point of view and a tourist's one, whose ""reality readings"" of the country are very different. The great success in the history is showing along the trip an Ecuadorian identity quite near to the daily thing, without falling in stereotypes or people's cartoons, observing characters, situations and very real dialogues.  Those which the public some time has been rounded more than once. Exactly this element hooks the spectator, causing several laughs due to its healthy and autochthonous sense of humor. Perhaps a little complicated for understanding to foreigners, but at the same time, shows facts that sometimes we prefer do not see as political uncertainty, migration and poverty.

The travelers are Cecilia Vallejo (Tristeza - Sadness) and Tania Martnez (Esperanza - Hope), who took the reins of this movie with a lot of security, and credibility.  Their  characters fit perfectly in the plot showing as common and pleasant people; we could be in any street with them or we'd be likely friends.  The girls learn from each other some things of the life, but other characters also did.  They are interpreted with a lot of naturalness by Francisco Aguirre (Jess) and Fausto Mio (Andrs).  They add a new and comic vision of the trip. Along the movie it's evident the great chemistry among each one of the actors of the cast, also supported by characters of smaller importance, and very well interpreted, since they help to know something more than the context of each stop.

The trip gives the opportunity to listen an impeccable and very Ecuadorian sound track with themes through the 8 provinces that they cross.  Their natural beauty is exploited by an excellent photography, where the main characteristic is the solitude and tranquility of the landscapes, they cause desires of traveling immediately through them.

'Que tan Lejos' is an amusing and authentic portrait of the Ecuador.  The director has been able to give life to a true product of local cinema and not only something filmed in Ecuador.  We get great satisfaction when we're seeing a film with identity.  The director includes in her history this amusing advice a couple of opportunities: 'beware of Cuencans'...(director is from Cuenca)"" ------------------------

8260589,3,B0015ZEKGE,"The movie's point is to speak of letting go of the past or re-interpreting facts to make you grow stronger.  Still, I wonder if this were a meditation on Ecuador that only those who know much about the nation would understand.
Many scenes are visually pleasing.  It will make you want to take a trip to the country.  It reminded me of ""Motorcycle Diaries"" with its lush scenes.  Still, it was hard for me to believe that people could bond with strangers so quickly and women could spend so much time with men they don't know where no witnesses are around.
A Spanish photographer and a European-derived Ecuadorean travel to a town to stop a wedding.  This work had surprise twists.  I've seen that a lot recently in Spanish-language films and wonder if it's a trait of their art.
So many people say, ""Latin American has no ethnic prejudices because of mestizaje.""  This film did not reflect that.  There were ethnic tensions here just like in ""Do the Right Thing"" or ""Crash.""  In fact, Ecuador is supposed to have many indigenous citizens, yet all their main characters are of European ancestry here.  This reminds me of how ""Cold Mountain"" focused on blonds, although it took place during the Civil War.
This reminded me of ""The Wizard of Oz"" in many ways.  If you like movies where characters take quests, then you may enjoy this.",1254268800,3,1331,4.645299145299146
