8076490,5,B000A9QKUU,"This ""Pet Alien"" DVD has four of my most favorite episodes starring Dinko and his wacky alien pals and their human friend Tommy Cadle(which Dinko humbly calls him ""Tommy of Earth"").

The episode ""The Amazing Atomic Tommy"" involves Tommy showing Dinko some magic tricks.  Now Dinko and the others are convinced that Tommy has super powers.  In ""I Was a Teenage Bearded Boy"", Tommy is sick and tired of being a kid.  So the aliens give Tommy a beard in order to make him look ""older"".  ""The Land that Size Forgot"" features Gumpers confused about a snowglobe, while ""The Day That Wouldn't End"" has Tommy in a deja vu situation.  (Note that every episode title in the series has a sci-fi horror feel to it.)

So ""Pet Alien"" is definitely one zany series that'll light your space rocket.",1139702400,,782,4.6231884057971016
8076491,5,B000A9QKUU,"Pet Alien is a fun series to watch. Who can say no to aliens falling from outer space to put havoc into a a young boy's life? It's always really funny to see the aliens try to understand Earthlings, but misunderstands everything.

The Atomic Tommy DVD has some pretty cool episodes that young and older kids can enjoy. Plots are to the point, gags are funny, and the animation is just fantastic. I rarely see good 3D animation for a TV show, but this is very nice.

One episode's plot got a little lost at the beginning of the episode due to too many things going on at the same time, but later, it gets back on track perfectly. The other episodes' plots are to the point and fun. No complaint.

I'm buying a few for my young cousins for Christmas.",1134691200,3,748,4.290780141843972
