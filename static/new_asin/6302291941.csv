7824605,3,6302291941,"Although it does not give any indication of it on the box, this  documentary is a period piece, an official Marine Corps film produced for  the U.S. Government Office of War Information, with no date of release  given, but probably 1945. The narration is straightforward, basically  telling you what you're looking at. There is no critical analysis, no  alternate viewpoints, no mention of controversial command decisions, and  there was little or no access to Japanese documents at that time. What you  do get is some incredible color footage, miraculously filmed by Marine  photographers of the 2nd Division. This contains intense, up-close combat  scenes that will give you a renewed respect for these 19-21 year old  Marines. Watch for a scene of Marines swarming up a Japanese emplacement  and assaulting it with rifles, grenades, and flamethrowers. This sand  covered emplacement became known as Bonnyman's Hill (not identified as such  in the film) named for the Marine's legendary Lt. Sandy Bonnyman, who led  the assault on this emplacement with his squad of assault engineers who  became known as ""Bonnyman's Forlorn Hope."" It was fortunate that  a Marine photographer was there to film the assault. For an analytical look  at this battle, see the History Channel's documentary Death Tide At Tarawa,  also available on video and DVD from Amazon. Anyone interested in this  battle or in World War II history in general would benefit greatly by  reading Col. Joseph H. Alexander's history, Utmost Savagery: The Three Days  of Tarawa, by far the best book on this battle.",959990400,22,1578,5.133858267716535
