2681960,1,B000K2QLPQ,"This Bibleman Adventure is not up to the usual standards of this series. The plot is scripturally based, but plodding and boring. It is also not as humorous as other Bibleman Adventures. Bibleman: Tuning out the Unholy Hero surpasses this one by far!",1214956800,4,250,4.837209302325581
2681961,4,B000K2QLPQ,"Honestly, compared to Star Wars or other major movie releases, this is a low-budget film.  Are you watching it for the special effects?  Or for the content?

If the content, then the movie is very wholesome and worthwhile.  Just make sure your viewing audience is of a young age, otherwise they'll be bored with it.",1214438400,2,315,4.672727272727273

8154031,5,B000K2QLPQ,My 22 year old used to watch these as a kid.  Great Christian show that teaches scripture along with good morals.  Bought this one for my Sunday School class and they loved it!!,1408233600,,177,4.333333333333333
8154032,5,B000K2QLPQ,I remember this from when I was a little girl. My four year old son is into super heroes and I thought this would be a little better for him to watch,1379116800,,149,3.6875
8154033,4,B000K2QLPQ,My kids love Bibleman. Is it a little cheesy but very clean. It teaches great lessons and Bible verse memorization.,1364083200,,115,4.8
8154034,5,B000K2QLPQ,"Bought bible man as an alternative to the mass influx of superhero stuff invading my house.my 5yr old loves it. His sword of the spirit has led into us to talking about the armor of God. I feel that it is something awesome to get you started talking to your kids about God,Jesus and the Holy Spirit.",1358640000,,299,4.2631578947368425
8154035,5,B000K2QLPQ,Very Good.  Approve of the method to instill the commandment.  Kids liked it.,1235433600,,77,4.846153846153846
8154036,4,B000K2QLPQ,Great message for younger viewers.  It is nice to have a Christian alternative to all the other superheroes. My 5 yr old loves bibleman and even quotes many of the scriptures used in the shows.,1233705600,,193,4.514285714285714
8154037,4,B000K2QLPQ,"I thought it was an adorable series, 4-stars since the acting isn't that believable, but it's not awful.  My three-year old son now wants to be a ""Bibleman"" when he grows up.  I know it's just a show, but adults should take note how Bibleman has a scripture counter verse for every ploy of the bad guys.  Imagine if we could do the same thing in our day to day lives!",1217548800,,367,4.140845070422535
