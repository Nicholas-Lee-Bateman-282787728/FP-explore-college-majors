2764514,4,B000ND91X6,"While calling this a 'Swashbuckler' collection is misleading (these aren't the swordfighting, acrobatic adventures synonymous with Fairbanks, Flynn, Lancaster, or even Power, in ""The Mark of Zorro""), these are vastly entertaining films, and Tyrone Power is always a joy of watch!

The oldest of the films, ""Blood and Sand"", is the strangest entry of the collection; while the other films are historical epics, this technicolor morality tale, told in a bullfight saga, was released in pre-WWII 1941. A remake of Rudolph Valentino's 1922 silent classic, Power is the fearless matador loved by sweet Linda Darnell, but corrupted by sophisticated vixen Rita Hayworth (being groomed for stardom at the time). The fun of this film isn't so much the drama, however, as the beauty of Power and Hayworth, and a fabulous supporting cast, including Anthony Quinn, Laird Cregar, and John Carradine; watch for future 'Superman' George Reeves in a small role!

""Son of Fury"" (1942) is best-known as the film that helped launch Gene Tierney's career, and the sad swansong of Frances Farmer's attempted comeback, but it is closer in spirit to ""Anthony Adverse"" than swashbuckler. Supposedly illegitimate Power is abused by sadistic uncle George Sanders, and flees to the South Seas to gain the wealth to contest his status, falling for island girl Tierney. Don't miss the climactic fistfight between Power and Sanders; it's nearly as spectacular as the Wayne/Scott brawl in ""The Spoilers""!

The end of WWII brought a new 'consciousness' to historical epics, and Power's films would be among the best, marred only by some poorly-cast leading ladies. ""Captain from Castile"" (1947) offered the one exception, sultry Jean Peters; while the concept was similar to ""Son of Fury"" (hero goes overseas...Mexico, this time...seeking fortune and fame to clear name), the film benefits from breathtaking Technicolor Mexican locations (watch for the active volcanoes!), a first-rate cast, including Cesar Romero (fabulous as Cortez), and Alfred Newman's unforgettable score. ""Prince of Foxes"" (1949), first of two Power teamings with Orson Welles, is one of Hollywood's first 'intellectual' epics; In 16th certury Italy, a pretender (Power), gains the confidence of legendary Cesare Borgia (Welles), who uses Power's wiles to win cities in his plan to conquer and unite Italy. Unfortunately, conscience (in the form of miscast Wanda Hendrix), would get in the way! ""The Black Rose"" (1950), set in 13th century Britain, completes the collection; again, Power goes to foreign lands (this time, China) to win a fortune, and save his Saxon family's estate and honor, accompanied by loyal Jack Hawkins (who nearly steals the film). He enters the service of exotic General Bayan (Welles), and wins the heart of captive Cecile Aubry (easily the worst of Power's leading ladies), bringing China's wonders back to the West. Produced in England, on a smaller budget, the film lacks the 'sweep' of the other titles, and Power (at 36) is getting a bit old to be playing youths, but it is still entertaining!

For Tyrone Power's many fans (including me), finally seeing these titles on DVD is a cause to celebrate, and one hopes that more of his film work will soon be available!",1179878400,74,3237,5.219230769230769
2764515,5,B000ND91X6,"Errol Flynn was under contract to Warners, Stewart Granger to MGM, and their great films have been available on VHS and DVD for some time.  But Tyrone Power was under constract to Fox, and Fox has been downright stingy about releasing Power's oevre to DVD - until now!  For us Ty Power fans, this boxed set is a godsend, one for which we have been waiting for years.  The set includes five of Power's best:

""Blood and Sand,"" from the novel by Ibanez, has Ty stepping into Rudloph Valentino's shoes, which he fills very nicely, as the talented and charming but doomed bullfighter, led on by the gorgeous and evil Rita Hayworth who flamencos up a storm.  Anthony Quinn as his hot-blooded rival and Laird Cregar a most slimy and rotund villain.

""Son of Fury,"" from a novel by Edison Marshall, rarely shown, has Ty making love to fetching Gene Tierney and matching wits and fistcuffs with George Saunders, one of the screen's most rapacious villains - and NOBODY can eat a grape like George Saunders!

""The Black Rose"" from the novel by Thomas Costain features Ty as Walter of Guerney, the illegitimate son of a Saxon noble who finds himself in the court of Kublai Khan in the 13th Century.  Orson Welles steals the show as the Mongol general, Bayan of the Hundred Eyes.  First rate production values, exquisitely photographed by the legendary Jack Cardiff.

""Prince of Foxes,"" from the novel by Samuel Shellabarger, has Ty as Andrea Orsini, Renaissance adventurer, swordsman, lover and assassin in the service of Cesare Borgia, played slyly by Orson Welles.  The cast is aided by Everett Sloan and Felix Aylmer.  Photographed against the backdrop of Tuscan palazzos, this film should have been filmed in color.  The transfer could have been better.  The sound crackles and fades from time to time.  Technically, this is the only one of the five that did not receive the treatment it should have, but rousing and worth viewing all the same.

Rounding out the set, ""Captain from Castille,"" also from a novel by Shellabarger, has Ty as Pedro de Vargas, the son of a Spanish nobleman whose family is persecuted by the Inquisition in the person of oily John Sutton, a most loathsome and cowardly villain.  With Caesar Romero as a lusty and bearded Hernando Cortez, Thomas Gomez as the kindly priest, and Jean Peters as Ty's love interest.  Running time is 140 minutes and there's nary a dull moment.

With baited breath I await Volume Two:  ""The Mark of Zorro,"" ""Jesse James,"" ""Lloyds of London,""King of the Khyber Rifles,"" and ""The Pony Soldiers.""",1179705600,15,2542,4.786697247706422
2764516,5,B000ND91X6,"This is a great selection of historical dramas starring perhaps the most underrated leading man of his time, Tyrone Power (i.e. he was popular in his day, but seems to be much more obscure now).  This is ideal as an introduction to Power's work, or to flesh out one's own classic film collection.  If you already have The Razor's Edge, The Black Swan and Nightmare Alley, you owe it to yourself to add these Tyrone Power classics to the fold.",1179446400,13,442,4.5125
2764517,5,B000ND91X6,"With this 5-DVD set, 20th Century Fox is finally doing justice to its great star and huge box office winner for many years, Tyrone Power.  Included: Blood and Sand, Son of Fury, The Black Rose, The Prince of Foxes, and The Captain from Castile.

Fox has really gone all the way with this one, with the inclusion of postcard-sized lobby cards and four exquisite features, including excellent commentary, isolated scores of Captain from Castile and Prince of Foxes that are INCREDIBLE, and many other elements.  I do not feel that Fox took the cheap way out at all.  Through Warner Brothers in the past has had more output than Fox, Warners recently has not given the attention to their DVD sets as Fox has on this Power set. I have been critical of Fox in the past for their DVD production, but I think they're trying to make up for it now.  It's a beautifully compiled set.

Three of the films are in color: Blood and Sand, The Black Rose, and The Captain from Castile. The color in Blood and Sand is excellent; in fact, there is a commentary by Richard Crudo, Pres. of American Society of Cinematographers who speaks about this film. The split-screen technique shows the beauty of the restoration.

Son of Fury is in black and white - there is some light flickering contrast but I think the picture looks great, using a dual-layering process.

The first two reels of Captain From Castile has some color problems but after that it's fine - and the score is a treasure.  Make sure to listen to the isolated score by Randy Newman that is offered.  It's also an excellent film, with great performances.

Actually I don't entirely agree with the negative review of the Prince of Foxes quality - it's not perfect but the black and white is fine, and I thoroughly loved watching the film.  Again, the score is sensational.

My least favorite film in the set is The Black Rose, which as one reviewer suggests, was added because The Black Swan and Zorro had already seen release.  However, the color is probably the best of the set.

I hope Fox will continue with another Power series and include Lloyds of London, I'll Never Forget You, Suez, and other of this fine actor's films.",1178236800,41,2173,4.5932642487046635
2764518,5,B000ND91X6,"Finally Tyrone Power has his own box set collection, and we fans hope it is the first of many.

Unfortunately, Power's best swashbuckling/adventure films, The Mark of Zorro and The Black Swan, have already been released.  Nevertheless, this set has three absolute gems - Blood and Sand, Captain from Castile, and  Son of Fury, all top-notch films.  The latter film introduced the gorgeous Gene Tierney to audiences.

I'm not crazy about the outside cover artwork (from Captain from Castile), which doesn't resemble Power, but the artwork on the remaining individual DVD covers is stunning, and there is some wonderful film restoration done. I'll never get over not seeing Prince of Foxes in color.  If there was ever a movie that deserves to be colorized (in a good way, like The Mark of Zorro was - I am NOT referring to the old colorization that Ted Turner did) - it's Prince of Foxes, with its authentic Italian surroundings and interiors. I hope Fox will eventually do that.

Power gives wonderful performances in all of the films. I admit my least favorite movie here is The Black Rose, in no small measure because of Cecile Aubrey, but the movie is pretty to look at. For brilliant direction, performances and cinematography, the Oscar-winning Blood and Sand is fantastic and is my favorite film in the set.  It also has my favorite performance of Power's - in, not surprisingly, the best role - of the five films.

The other thing this set has is fantastic FEATURES - all of them are great, and one of them is a Power family reunion of sorts, with Linda Christian, her two children, and Tyrone Power Jr.  This is a real treasure.  There is also ""The Leading Ladies"" which features some of his living costars - Patricia Neal, Jayne Meadows, Terry Moore, Colleen Gray. A third feature is a Movietone about his fabulous wedding to Linda Christian, where 10,000 people mobbed the outside of the church (as opposed to the 1,000 when Tom Cruise married in the same place in Italy). The last feature is ""Behind the Scenes"" with some wonderful still photographs, clips, and interviews with Oscar nominee James Cromwell, whose father directed the film, and comments from a film historian.

Ty fans will love this.  It is SO GREAT to have Captain from Castile, Son of Fury, Blood and Sand, Prince of Foxes, and The Black Rose out on DVD.  Here's hoping Power gets the second collection he deserves.",1177977600,58,2395,4.767554479418886
2764519,4,B000ND91X6,"This is one of those old Hollywood saturated-color films that successfully transports me to another time and place, even on subsequent viewings. The plot steamrolls over its problems, leaving me with the sense of having had an exciting journey from England to North Africa to China.

It's based on a Thomas B Costain's novel of the same name and it brings from its source enuf 13th century details to give the story a historical feeling. The exquisite location photography of Jack Cardiff (in England and Morocco) completes the phenomenon.

Tyrone Power (as a Saxon embittered with Norman England) heads a fine, mostly British cast. He may be a tad bit too old and too stiff, but he's personable and has good chemistry with Jack Hawkins as a fellow Saxon runaway, and with the massively charismatic Orson Welles as Bayan of the Hundred Eyes (a historical Mongol General).

Ccile Aubry as ""The Black Rose"" is a mixed bag. She's gives a very good performance as the over-eager half-English, half-Arabic girl trapped in the Mongol caravan. But she's blonde and blue-eyed! She has a French, not an Arabic accent. And she's too little-girl-cute for my taste.

This is not a action/adventure movie by today's standards. It's too thoughtful. But that's why I like this film more.",1176854400,17,1272,4.929906542056075
2764520,5,B000ND91X6,"Tyrone Power has been one of my favorite actors since my childhood. Every Saturday night, on Saturday Night at the Movies, wonderful films were shown, and many of them featured Tyrone Power. My favorite of all these films was The Black Rose -- a romantic adventure that travels from England to China and back again. It was an amazing film! So is The Prince of Foxes-- and both of these films include stellar work by Orson Welles.

2764530,3,B000ND91X6,"This movie was shown on a NBC summer replacement series of movies back in the 50s. As a child, I was greatly attracted by the trailers for it shown as previews on the series. I waited expectantly for its showing and was disappointed when it was rescheduled at least once and maybe again. I was not disappointed when it was shown.  My childhood expectations were not disappointed and I greatly enjoyed the adventure-filled movie when it was shown on NBC.

I bought a copy of this movie with the excitement of my childhood experience in mind. I'm afraid that  I have grown up since my childhood over 50 years ago. The movie is fine. it has a Hollywood adventure story with some good acting. The characters are not stereotyped but they are not deep either. The plot is rather melodramatic but it is not trivial. This is a movie that would be good for an evening's entertainment. it would be worth buying but childhood experiences are difficult to replicate given an adult sensibility.",1474243200,,981,4.658959537572255

2764535,4,B000ND91X6,"An interesting combination of Power's films.  From great to just awful.  Let's take them from bad to great.  ""The Black  Rose"" a pseudo Marco Polo traveling to China with his friend, a powerful English bowman,played by a very young Jack Hawkins.  They meet up with a rogue warrior played by Orson Wells who has a gift for Kublai Khan called the Black Rose.  Unfortunately the movie falls apart when we discover the Black Rose is played by the untalented Cecile Aubry, a French actress with far too much lipstick for those lips trying to speak English.
""Blood and Sand"" is the bullfight movie.  With Rita Hayworth!  ""Son of Fury.""  A take on those Robert Louis Stevenson stories about stolen birthrights.  But not as good. But with Gene Tierney as a south pacific island princess!
""Captain from Castile"" with Power joining  Cortez's conquest of Mexico.  With a role for Jay Silverheels that wasn't a mockery of his ancestry.  And with Jean Peters!  Finally, the best, 'Prince of Foxes'.  Orson Welles at his best, Everett Sloane at his duplicitous best, Power at his swashbuckling best.  Even Wanda Hendrix as the sweet-aloof love interest does a good job.
The last two were shot directly on location.  Mexico provided volcanos spouting ominous smoke while Italy showed off why its central mountain spine is so spectacular.",1468972800,2,1322,4.909502262443439

For some reason one movie was missing the color replica & another missing the collectable cards that correspond with the movie,  I can hardly complain as these were all extra's I was not expecting to begin with!!!  The only complaint I have is a small one & that is that these great film's are not in widescreen.  Someone may be able to burn a copy of a movie but when a product comes with valuable extra's both on the D.V.D.'s themselves as well as included in the box set like the above mentioned cards at such a fair price its well worth the purchase & rewards the honest with things the pirate will never get!!!  As far as the movies in this box set let me just say they are all very entertaining & I am pleased to have them in my collection !!!  All of these movies are filled with stunning opulent sets & beautiful costumes that show through even in the B/W movies, as far as the color movies they are at times stunningly beautiful especially in the movie ""The Black Rose"" I don't think there is a color missing in the silk robes of the Chinese Emissary,  l.o.l.!!!  This boxed Set is a great introduction into the incredible movies that Tyrone Power's has been in, and could have been titled Tyrone Power's Period Pieces.  It is guaranteed to please fans of action adventures & swashbucklers!  Another huge plus that this collection offers is the power house talent that share the screen with Mr. Power's!!!  I would recommend this Box set to anyone that loves action adventure & great story telling, for the price of one C.G.I. infested, emotionless modern movie you get not 1 but 5 classic & classy time tested movie's that the whole family can enjoy!!!  I don't like to go into great detail about the movies for fear of spoiling them or raising expectation's & then having the movie fall short because each individual has their own personal taste.

2764605,2,B000ND91X6,"Single DVD of ""The Black Rose"" only. Having read the excellent eponymous Thomas Costain novel, I was sadly disappointed by this film version. The plot is very different, leaving out most of the interesting episodes, especially Maryam's epic search for her husband. To answer a question asked by many viewers, Maryam is known as ""the Black Rose"" because in the novel, as Walter notices, ""There was an unusual quality about her--that much he sensed; due perhaps to the fact that, although her hair was black and her skin of a slightly olive tint, her eyes were a bright blue."" Walter also speaks of  the ""unmistakable Grecian purity of feature [of her face]."" The makers of the movie seem to have reversed everything about Maryam, and thus destroyed the meaning of the title.

Tyrone Power strolls through his part like a guest at a party he didn't really want to go to. I give this movie two stars, however, because Jack Hawkins is one of my favorite actors, and he is at his best and most attractive in the unusual role of Tristram, the British archer. If you, too, admire Jack Hawkins, and if you are skilled in fast-forwarding, This DVD is worth having for the scenes in which Jack Hawkins appears. He doesn't need to upstage Tyrone Power. He just shows his viewers what acting is all about!",1405468800,,1293,4.666666666666667

2764609,4,B000ND91X6,"I bought this collection mainly in hopes of swashbuckling action, scenes of medieval times, etc.  Well, there are scenes of medieval times, but swashbuckling action, not so much.  There are some battle scenes, and even the occasional sword fight, but if you are looking for a film in the style of The Mark of Zorro, none of these films measure up.  Mostly they are historical dramas with aspects of adventure tales.

The collection is not entirely a disappointment, however.  Three of the films are in color and the photography is beautiful; the music, too, is also beautiful.  Tyrone Power's acting is -- well, just what you'd expect from Tyrone Power in historical or adventure films.  He's a reasonably good actor and carries each picture quite well.

If you're a fan of old films, and love seeing your favorite character actors, you'll enjoy this set.  For example, Blood and Sand can boast supporting actors such as Anthony Quinn, J. Carroll Naish, Laird Cregar, John Carradine, and even George (Superman) Reeves in one of his earlier roles.  Son of Fury has Elsa Lanchester (who is wonderful in her part), Dudley Digges, Roddy McDowall, Harry Davenport, and Carradine again (in a better role than in the previous picture).  The Captain from Castile has Cesar Romero (if you look closely, you can see the contours of the Joker's face!) as a charming (if dubiously historical) conquistador Cortez, and also, in an unusual role for him, Lee J. Cobb, as well as George Zucco.  Prince of Foxes has Orson Welles as a wonderfully cynical and scheming Cesare Borgia, and wonderful performances by Felix Aylmer and Everett Sloane, with a good bit part by Eduardo Ciannelli.  The Black Rose has Finlay Currie, Jack Hawkins, and Michael Rennie, with bit parts by a young Laurence Harvey and Herbert Lom.

If you are a historian, and think that historical films should make at least some slight effort to be accurate, you will hate many of these films.  The portrait of Muslims, Mongols, and medieval China in The Black Rose makes Cecil B. DeMille's historical epics (often criticized for being more Hollywood than history) look like precise scholarly treatises by comparison.  There are deformations of various kinds in all the historical material in these films.

More serious than the historical inaccuracy are the weak scripts.  The scripts from The Black Rose and The Captain from Castile are abominable; the plots aren't very good or coherent, and the dialogue is often weak as well.

The best film, in my view, is Prince of Foxes, which, while doubtless deforming Renaissance Italian history to some degree, is closer to the spirit of Renaissance political life than, say, The Black Rose is to the ethos of medieval Asia.  Much of Prince of Foxes was shot on location in Italy, and I deeply regret that Fox decided that color film would be too expensive.  The film still looks good in black and white; it would have been magnificent in color, and I would rather have seen those real Italian castles and Renaissance battle-scenes in color that than, say, The Captain from Castile, which is pretty much romantic fluff.

There are plenty of extras in this set, including commentaries on two of the five films (unfortunately none on Prince of Foxes, the best of the films), and a number of features on the life and career of Tyrone Power, including interviews with some of his later leading ladies and some of his surviving wives and children, and a short news clip of his marriage in Italy to actress Linda Christian (later to play the first Bond girl in the 1-hour television version of Casino Royale in the 1950s).  If you are into collecting scraps of video about Tyrone Power, then you will probably want this set.

There are also four black-and-white postcard-size stills from the films in each DVD case.

Each of the five films has its own DVD case, and the set is in a cardboard slipcase.  I had no problems playing any of the DVDs on my standards DVD/VHS player, so I cannot confirm reports elsewhere here of skips and freezes.

This collection would probably be called a must-have for Tyrone Power devotees; it is a ""nice to have, if not essential"" collection for those who enjoy 1940s films generally, like Power well enough, and enjoy beautifully photographed historical dramas with good musical scores.  In my view, the best film is Prince of Foxes, with its great performance by all actors, including Welles (Welles's performance in Black Rose is less memorable, largely because of the lousy script and incoherent plot), but Son of Fury has much to recommend it (a featured role for Frances Farmer, and a wonderful early appearance by Gene Tierney, and a good plot, with a suitably villainous George Sanders, Powers's nemesis from The Black Swan).  Unfortunately Son of Fury is only in black and white.  Blood and Sand is pretty good as well.  I don't know if it matches up with the silent original, which I haven't seen, but it has its moments, with Linda Darnell as the good wife and Rita Hayworth as the temptress who lures Power into wickedness, and a wonderful Vincent Price-like turn by Laird Cregar, an underrated actor who produced some very good work in his short, 5-year career.  I'd give the movies about 3.5 stars (8 out of 10 for Prince of Foxes and Son of Fury, the two black and white films, and somewhere between 7 and 7.5 out of 10 for each of the three color films), but the collection is so nicely done (good DVD quality and extras) that I'd give the whole package 4 stars.",1403049600,4,5503,4.784355179704017

2764613,5,B000ND91X6,"This is an old favorite from my childhood, watching The Black Rose on TV. Back then, I was interested in the swashbuckling aspects of the film, and there's plenty of that!

But what appeals to me as an adult is the performance of the title character, Miriam, as played by then-19-year-old Cecile Aubry. The Black Rose is a codename for Miriam, and is also a code name for one of the most precious and valuable trade items in the medieval world, the Clove, as Europeans sought spices to enhance the flavor of their uninspiring cuisine--and paid fantastic prices for them. Aubry plays Miriam as an eternally positive, up beat character who is a bundle of adorableness whom Tyrone Power's character tries very hard to resist.

The cast is rounded out by Jack Hawkins as a Saxon yeoman who is very fond of his own skills with the ""wonder weapon"" of that age, the English longbow; and Orson Welles as the Mongol general who ruthlessly sweeps through Asia, conquering cities and slaughtering everyone in his path.

As a film, I thought the supporting actors and cameos were the most interesting part (Orson Welles as Bayan of the Hundred Eyes, Jack Hawkins as Tristan--although physically wrong for the character as written, Michael Rennie as King Edward, and Robert Blake as the camp boy).

2764646,4,B000ND91X6,"My one frustration is that I cannot remember the story of the title. It was Maryam's nickname, but I don't remember why.

It was two centuries after the Norman conquest, but the Saxons hadn't resigned themselves to Norman rule. Young Walter of Gurnie (Tyrone Power) was the bastard son of a Saxon nobleman, acknowledged and loved to the extent possible. But Walter's father had been injured in the Crusades, and was nursed back to health in a Norman household, where he ended up marrying the daughter of the house who had nursed him. At that point, he did not know that the Saxon lady he had left behind had borne him a son, or he would never have married the Norman. Still, it was a diplomatic move, and came to be accepted by his kinsmen.

When he died, he mentioned Walter in his will, which enraged his widow. He also commended Walter to the service of King Edward (Michael Rennie), but Walter refused. He still hated Normans so completely that he simply could not do it. Then he became involved in a Saxon rebellion, and found it necessary to leave England. His friend Tristran (Jack Hawkins), an expert with the long bow, went with him.

In the middle east, they joined a caravan to Cathay (China) which was traveling with and guarded by the Mongol warlord Bayan (Orson Welles). Not to spoil the story, he manages to bring back the secrets of gunpowder, magnetic compass, printing, paper making, and a variety of other useful things. Oh yes, and Maryam, a half-caste English lady (Cecile Aubry). Her nickname was ""the Black Rose,"" but I don't recall why.",1336780800,,1560,4.644927536231884

Unfortunately, Ty is saddled with a role that seems ill suited to his age - he's almost a juvenile here.  (Plus, what is with the positively infantile female lead!)

2764662,2,B000ND91X6,"Sometimes love of a genre can make you overlook some films' problems that seem overwhelming to unbiased observers, so it's worth noting my bias for epic adventures when I say that The Black Rose is still pretty dreadful by anyone's standards. A big-budget misfire with a distinct lack of swash to its buckle and a miscast Tyrone Power playing a part he's a good twenty years too old to get away with, there's a promising enough plot - Power's disinherited Saxon `youth' leaves England rather than serve a Norman king to find his fortune in the Far East, where he's drawn into Kublai Khan's plans to conquer China - but it's quickly smothered. Desperately uninteresting characters, no battles, virtually no action but a lot of sulking and a surfeit of silly names - the hero is called Walter of Gurney and that's just for starters - ensure that it's the kind of film your body actively rebels against while watching, urging you to do something more useful like going to sleep instead.

A decent supporting cast of British movie regulars (James Robertson Justice, Finlay Currie, Herbert Lom) try their best, though some, like Michael Rennie, barely hide their boredom at it all. Despite getting off to a truly terrible start, Jack Hawkins' sidekick at least improves as the film goes on, which is more than can be said for leading lady Cecile Aubrey, who looks like the kind of annoyingly precious schoolgirl that makes vasectomy seem like a good idea. The less said about a horrendously badly dubbed Alfonso Bedoya the better.

It's not a total loss - Orson Welles' genial turn as Kublai Khan's ruthless general Bayan `of the Hundred Eyes' sees to that even though he has nothing to do but act genial and bemused by his English recruits. If anything, the presence of the director of Citizen Kane in the cast only acts to remind you of how shoddily made the film is. Some of the editing is surprisingly crude and awkward, with many shots matching so badly you could almost be forgiven for thinking they were shot for different films, and it's hard to tell whether the surprisingly dreary Technicolor photography in the English scenes is by design or simply down to color fading. Even Richard Addinsell can't summon up any enthusiasm in his score. It's hard not to agree when Power says ""I wish I had something more to tell you. It all ought to add up to something."" Dire stuff.

""Prince of Foxes"". in my opinion the best of the bunch, it could have been better if not by the fatal miscasting of Wanda Hendrix.
""Blood and Sand"", as another reviewer pointed out, should have died with Valentino.
""Captain from Castile"" although a nice looking film, it is so historically inaccurate and Cesar Romero as Cortez! Had the casting agent done some research he could have found that the reason why Cortez was able to trick the Aztecs was because of his golden hair and golden beard, so the natives thought that he was the ""White God"" that was supposed to come. But as in most cases he went for the sterotype: Spanish=Dark.
""The Black Rose"", the worst of the collection. Silly!!
""Son of Fury"", perhaps the most pleasant and enjoyable.

2764668,4,B000ND91X6,"Back in the days of the studio system, every major studio had its bank of contract players.  With Warner Brothers, you'd see James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, but also supporting actors like Alan Hale.  There was also Errol Flynn, and to some extent, I believe that Tyrone Power was 20th Century Fox's answer to Warners's resident swashbuckler.  Certainly, the Tyrone Power Collection features Powers in many of his swashbuckliest roles.

Chronologically, the first of the five movies is Blood and Sand, with Power as a famous bullfighter.  Fame and fortune come with a price, as Power is distracted from his marriage to his childhood sweetheart by the love-`em-and-lose-`em rich girl played by Rita Hayworth.  There are plenty of other Fox regulars in this film, including Linda Darnell as the loyal wife, John Carradine as Power's best friend and Laird Cregar as a bullfighting critic.  It's a nice-looking film (in fact, a commentary track by a cinematographer explains the film technique in great detail), but just okay storywise.

Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake has Power as the illegitimate son of a wealthy lord.  Actually, he may not really be illegitimate, but proof is hard to find, and his uncle (played by George Sanders) will do all he can to keep hold of the title.  This forces Power into servitude in an era where by class alone, he has no rights.  He gets an opportunity to flee to the South Seas, where he hooks up with Gene Tierney.

In Captain from Castile, Power is once again a fugitive, this time from the Spanish Inquisition.  He winds up in Cuba, where he joins Cortes (played by Cesar Romero) in an expedition to Mexico.  Power's noble birth and fighting talent makes him rise in the ranks, but there are many adversaries to deal with.  This is the other disc in the set with film commentary, this time by a trio of film historians.  For fans of USC sports, a bit of trivia:  the tune Conquest used by the Trojans was developed for this movie.

Prince of Foxes has Power serving a different conqueror, Cesar Borgia played by Orson Welles.  Power is sent to do advance intelligence work in a town slated for invasion, but instead he decides to help the townspeople instead (in part, no doubt, because of the beautiful wife of the town's aged ruler).

The final movie, The Black Rose is another period piece, with Power as a nobleman in the time of Edward I of England.  Disgusted with the oppression of Saxons, Power heads to the Orient, where he hooks up with Welles again, this time as a general working with Kubla Khan to invade China.  Will Power find wealth?  Will he rescue the beautiful girl of English descent, sold into slavery when her crusader father died?

Power is a decent enough actor and all these movies are reasonably entertaining, but none are real classics.  In part, this is because of Power, who compared with his contemporary, Flynn, doesn't have the same charm or presence; I think Power actually works better in other, darker roles, such as in Nightmare Alley.  As a set, this is pretty nice for Power fans:  besides the movies, there are lots of extras, including the commentary tracks, trailers, still galleries, documentaries, a little booklet and lots of lobby cards.  This may not be a set of the greatest movies ever, but it is a set worth watching.",1215907200,5,3315,4.7282229965156795

2764680,2,B000ND91X6,"The Black Rose is an extremely uninvolving film, due both to its unfocused script and the miscasting of Tyrone Power and Cecile Aubrey.  Power is far too old to play an Oxford student who has dropped out of college.  A 20 year old in the part might have made the hot-headedness of the character acceptable, but Power was 35 when he made this, and watching him behave this way simply made me think he was immature or nasty and vindictive.  Cecile Aubrey is truly awful.  She comes across as a child, and has no sex appeal or chemistry with Power.  It's doubly curious that she's called ""The Black Rose"" even though she has blonde hair and a light complexion.  Orson Welles has some enjoyable moments as the warlord, and Jack Hawkins is solid as the best friend.  There is some nice production value, but there are no battle scenes that actually take place on screen.  This is a movie in which things just happen, but not because the characters are driven to make them happen.  All in all, it's rather dull and definitely not recommended.

The DVD transfer is a major disappointment.  The colors are not at all vibrant, and it doesn't appear that any effort was made to adjust the contrast and brightness levels properly, much less do any sort of a restoration.  Since Jack Cardiff shot the film, it's impossible to believe it would have looked so lackluster in the theater.

Costain. Walter of Gurnie, played by Tyrone Power, is 21 years old in the film while Tyrone was 36 but looked more, and Cecile Aubry, who was 22 years old in 1950, looked 14 as Maryam. It's no big deal but I still felt uncomfortable during the love scenes between the two characters. However, Orson Welles is brilliant as Bayan and steals the show each time he's on the screen.

I didn't read Costain's book but I can imagine that the author's main idea was to describe how the feeling to belong to a same nation could grow between people as different as Saxons and Normans. This antagonism is well symbolized by the character of Maryam who is clearly described as dual, remember how she must always disguise or apply heavy make-up over her body in order to look as an English girl. This duality is also present in the couple Walter of Gurnie/Tristram Griffin, the rational student and the poet with a bow.

The problem is that these ideas, that are certainly very interesting in a book, are not handled in a very cinematographic manner. I always had the feeling to read a book when I watched THE BLACK ROSE, with its chapters well marked: the scene in the castle, the scene in the family home, the scene in the desert, the scene in the Empress of China's palace and so on. THE BLACK ROSE is meant to be a swashbuckler but there is hardly a fight at the end of the film. With bows and arrows and without Tyrone Power. We see, in numerous occasions, thousands of extras walking in the desert but not a single battle against the Chinese army ! All these considerations explain why I don't consider THE BLACK ROSE as a major achievement in neither Henry Hathaway's nor Tyrone Power's careers.

He meets up with Orson Wells as a Mongol general and manages to survive and carry back to England various Chinese secrets (an English version of Marco Polo).  The female star was poorly cast...but this is a movie that pushes through its problems with epic scenes of the Mongol army, and takes you back to old-time adventure stories, before the likes of Indiana Jones etc.

 Regardless of problems with editing and the plot, this movie is an enjoyable ride on the backs of Tyrone Power, Jack Hawkins, and Orson Welles.  This is not his best film, but so what.
