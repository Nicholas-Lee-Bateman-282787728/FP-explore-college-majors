8181503,1,B000NVI0EE,"Unofficial documentary that's officially a waste. A lousy scrap book style edited film of old David footage/photographs, unofficial, with ""Interview Exclusives"" with a handful of nobodies that claim to have known David, don't bother with this one. Buy some of David's official autobiographies instead.",1292630400,,301,5.863636363636363
