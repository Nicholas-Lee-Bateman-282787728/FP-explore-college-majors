6184730,5,B00HNBW60Q,"This DVD is incredible! I have been doing Barre in a studio setting for more than 2 years. When I purchased this DVD I knew I would be getting a great workout, but I didn't expect for my muscles to burn or shake the same way they do when I'm in class. The ladies of Neighborhood Barre know their stuff and they do an awesome job of incorporating calorie busting exercises that can easily be done at home!

I bought a DVD for my mother in law for Christmas and every time we talk she tells me how much she loves her DVD! She is in her 60s and said this is the first workout she has done where she can actually feel herself getting stronger! This DVD is definitely for all ages and not just for women. My husband just completed his first marathon after cross training for 2 years with Neighborhood Barre. He said he knew he couldn't have finished the race without Barre!",1391385600,,868,4.228915662650603
6184731,5,B00HNBW60Q,This DVD is great!! I felt like I was in the class with these ladies. It's a great way to get your shake on. Love barre!! You won't regret this purchase!!!,1390780800,,155,4.032258064516129
6184732,5,B00HNBW60Q,"This is the best workout DVD Ive ever tried! I never knew I could burn calories like this from my living room!! Unlike other DVDs I've tried, the instructor makes it easy to follow and it is a total body workout. Ive seen major changes in my body since starting Neighborhood Barre classes, and I feel the exact same burn and shake doing the DVD as I do in class (the good kind of burn and shake that tells you you're doing something right!!). Now I won't be worried about missing class when I leave town, because this DVD delivers the same workout satisfaction! The modifications also make it perfect for ALL fitness levels! You will NOT regret this purchase!!",1389744000,,660,4.508333333333334
6184733,5,B00HNBW60Q,I love Neighborhood Barre! Being able to do the workout at home is definitely a plus. I can still shake at home!,1389657600,,112,4.136363636363637
6184734,5,B00HNBW60Q,This is a great workout for anyone looking to lengthen and tone! I love going to class but when I can't make it this is definitely a great substitute!!!!,1389484800,,153,4.310344827586207
6184735,5,B00HNBW60Q,This is the best class replacement DVD!!! Fast paced and really makes you feel the shake! I love the modifications that are provided because I can do the DVD with everyone from my mother to my pregnant friends!,1389312000,,210,4.552631578947368
6184736,5,B00HNBW60Q,"This is by far the best at home barre video!  The asymmetric movements in this routine tone your body extremely fast!  This routine (along with a good diet!) gives you a lean & toned ballerina-type body!  I have been injured and can't run (which I used to do almost everyday) and this barre routine has kept my body in the shape I'm accustomed to.  Having this video is great because you can split it up in segments.  If you have just a little time during the day, you can split it up into 15 minutes of arms, 15 minutes of thighs, 15 minutes of glutes, and then 15 minutes of abs.  It's great when you can't go to a workout class or a gym!!!  I definitely recommend this video!!!!! YAY!  I'm so excited to have it!",1389312000,,715,4.205882352941177
6184737,5,B00HNBW60Q,"Divided into arms, thighs, seat, and abs, this workout is the best for effective toning and creating lean muscle.  After two kids, barreSKINNY is my go-to workout because I know I will see results almost instantly!  Katy provides the right amount of shake required to transform your body.  I love this workout and highly recommend it!",1389312000,,334,4.928571428571429
6184738,5,B00HNBW60Q,"Neighborhood barre is absolutely my favorite workout I've ever done (and I don't say that about every workout I've tried). I've always loved yoga and pilate type workouts, but have never found them challenging enough on their own. While I can feel myself getting stronger, the barreSKINNY workout never gets easy. I've been using the barreSKINNY technique for over a year now and am still challenged by it everyday. Being a runner, I love cross training with barreSKINNY (although it's quite difficult to both run AND do barre in one day). I love everything about Neighborhood Barre and the barreSKINNY fitness workout! You haven't done a barre workout until you've tried the barreSKINNY barre workout!",1389225600,,702,5.113043478260869
6184739,5,B00HNBW60Q,"Neighborhood barre is a world of its own and adds such a positive spin on life. Katy's perfected barre technique leaves you feeling your best, literally, sweat and all! The soft music in the video allows you to turn on your own favorite tunes creating a different experience every time you pulse,tuck,shake! The cues given really challenge you to focus on each movement pushing you to work a little harder each time you press play. If you've never tried barre, you will be amazed at the physical results small movements can make! Get out of your comfort zone and step into the NB world! Embrace the different challenges this unique video has to offer, and look forward to this addicting routine!",1403654400,,695,4.75206611570248
6184740,5,B00HNBW60Q,Best workout DVD I have ever done! My big booty has never looked so great! Highly recommend this to anyone one wanting to get that body looking good and toned!,1403654400,,159,4.333333333333333
6184741,5,B00HNBW60Q,"I love Barre classes and I love this video. Great workout.

The only thing that would make this better is to have fun music just like Neighborhood Barre class!",1403654400,,159,4.482758620689655
6184742,5,B00HNBW60Q,The next best thing to Neighborhood Barre class.  Great workout at home. It really tones your body. I would enjoy extra workouts added to the end of the volume 2 for a quick fast forward to work specific areas.,1403654400,,210,4.384615384615385
6184743,5,B00HNBW60Q,"This was by far the best workout DVD I have purchased. I have a very busy schedule, so fitting in going to a class is hard. It is great that I can do the class from home. I have had a lot of my friends borrow the DVD to see if they would like it and the results are always the same- they LOVE it.

I never anticipated I would really like this type of workout. I come from a soccer background where the workouts are extreme weights and running. I did not think this workout would do anything for me, but I was completely wrong. This workout is amazing and you see results in no time.

I recommend everyone go to a class or by this DVD!",1403654400,,634,3.9453125
6184744,5,B00HNBW60Q,"Love barre skinny.  Take it with me whenever i travel! Cant wait for volume 2! Please add the fonda, pretzel, standing splits, and one of the newer warm ups!",1403654400,,157,4.413793103448276
6184745,3,B00HNBW60Q,I have been taking Pure Barre workouts so I wanted to have this DVD when i traveled.  It was not as challenging as I would have liked but it was still a solid workout.  I was not sweating like in Pure but still loved the accessories it came with. Will contine to do when traveling.,1402358400,,281,4.090909090909091
6184746,5,B00HNBW60Q,I have been training and working out for years.  This is the most challenging workout I have ever tried.  barreSkinny will carve and sculpt your body.  You can do the DVD without having an actual barre!  I am a fan of Neighborhood Barre and barreSkinny.  Best complete workout.,1400716800,,277,4.6875
6184747,5,B00HNBW60Q,"I got the dvd as a gift and have used it at home. I was reluctant to go to a barre class thinking it would be hard to follow. Having done the Barre Skinny DVD first, I finally went to a class this week and I felt comfortable and confident joining in with the regular class members. This was an excellent way to get familiar with the barre techniques .",1393718400,,351,4.0285714285714285
6184748,5,B00HNBW60Q,"barre skinny is awesome!!! I regularly attend barre class at the neighborhood barre where this video was filmed and this DVD is just as good as being in a class!! If you want a real workout, make sure to get this DVD!!",1391472000,,218,4.214285714285714
8633653,5,B00HNBW60Q,"I love it! I had a problem with getting 2 back to back bad discs. But they worked with me and actually opened one before sending me another one. Very sweet and helpful!
The work out is great. I like how I can adjust it to my level of intensity. Its going to be helpful to make the work out results last longer. Over all a great product and company!",1522022400,,348,3.9857142857142858
8633654,5,B00HNBW60Q,"So far the best barre workout dvd I have come across. I own Physique 57, Bar Method, Booty Barre (all which are very good) but this Barre Skinny is so very challenging . My new favorite workout. Absolutely worth every penny .",1420329600,,225,4.380952380952381
8633655,5,B00HNBW60Q,Love it! Such a great work out!,1408320000,,31,3.5714285714285716
8633656,3,B00HNBW60Q,Decent work out but low budget filming and bad music some cueing used was annoying. I suggest your own playlist and turning off the sound.,1407801600,,138,4.56
8633657,5,B00HNBW60Q,"Thanks for making it easy for us to do this at home! I drive to class when I can, but when I can't, this is PERFECT! Very challenging, and works great!!!",1404000000,,153,3.967741935483871
8633658,5,B00HNBW60Q,This barre skinny dvd is such an amazing workout!  It is perfect for the days I can't get a sitter or can't get away from the house for some reason.  I also LOVE bringing it on my vacays with me so I can enjoy my trip but also not lose momentum on my workout regimen.  Total full body workout- I am always feeling sore the next day so I know it is doing its job! :-),1404000000,,366,3.789473684210526
8633659,5,B00HNBW60Q,Neighborhood barre is my favorite place to take barre class and the dvd is just as good of a workout as in person! barre skinny has helped me continue doing barre while I'm traveling or can't make it to the studio. On the video Katy is so good at motivating you the whole time and making sure you're working the right muscles. I was hooked once I tried it!,1404000000,,356,4.173913043478261
8633660,4,B00HNBW60Q,"Love this DVD! It took me several months to try it, as I would rather take Katy's class at the studio.  To my wonderful surprise, this is just like being at the Barre!  You get the same intense workout and feel like you've accomplished something.  This works out everything.  I would like to have the music that is used in class and less work with bands, should there be a barre skinny 2.  Thanks so much ladies at Neighborhood Barre!!",1403740800,,435,4.3875
8633661,5,B00HNBW60Q,"This DVD is awesome! I attended class throughout my entire pregnancy and loved everything about the workout. After having the baby, I wanted to work out.  I was sleep deprived and wasn't ready to put back on my tights just yet and head to class (not to mention you can't do much with a newborn at home!). The DVD was perfect to do in the comfort of my living room and gave me the shaky workout I craved! I highly recommend this to anyone of any fitness level. The results are truly amazing!",1403654400,,490,4.268817204301075
8633662,5,B00HNBW60Q,"I have tried ALL the barre videos, because I travel a good bit on business. Pure Barre, Barre Element, Cardio Barre... Take your pick, I've tried them all. None of them compare to Neighborhood Barre! Most of them are pretty difficult to do without the actual barre. I love how BarreSkinny demonstrates using a chair you could find most anywhere. It's just as intense as the studio workout. If you can't get to the Neighborhood Barre studio, the video is a must! It's the only one in my collection that's more than a dust collector.",1403654400,,531,4.6
