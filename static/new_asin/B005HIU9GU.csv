4701854,5,B005HIU9GU,"Educational, but I thought the cartoon cavemen seemed a little more for a first grader than an adult wanting to learn more about beer, which is why I would gave it a 4 out of 5.

Anything with Dr. Bamforth will be worth your time.  I learned a thing or two that I didn't already know.

The bonus clips were nice and informative, so I'll let the cavemen go.",1341014400,,356,4.130434782608695

4701858,5,B005HIU9GU,"This is a sweet, relatively short look at the contributions made by beer over the centuries.  It features several scholars from different colleges and universities, and it has several cute animations and exhibits the makers' love of beer and sense of humor.  They may take a few liberties, overstating the impacts, but it's worth your time if you are a fan of beer.",1328486400,,365,4.777777777777778

It's a great documentary - and informative about so many facts we'd never heard before. The final price was less than what I had paid when ordering, and my money was promptly returned.

We valued our leasure time as hunter-gathers and have had to relearn the joy of relaxation as ""civilized"" people. Beer is an essential in this process, not the drink but the ritual. The documentary also shows how the discovery, making and drinkin of beer was part of the process that made civilization.

4701865,1,B005HIU9GU,"Don't believe anything in this film.  They consciously and selectively chose to share only the evidence that supported their standpoint... thereby minimizing and omitting  key points of information that otherwise would have described a very different, and much more accurate narrative.

We fact checked throughout this video.  They misquoted people like Ben Franklin,completely misrepresented information, and told the entire story to support the title of the documentary.",1484784000,,472,6.0

He brews his own beer, so anything beer related is usually a safe bet on a good gift for him!  Even my mother in law watched it and found it interesting.

The pattern of beer driving civilization revealed.
Well done people at Discover.
One gender Glitch:  The folks telling the story have Hunters gather barley and discover beer.
My mythology class, when asked, knew it was wrong headed.
They knew the Gatherers discovered beer!
When the Hunters asked, ""How can we get more?""
The women:  ""Stay put on the river of this fruited plain.""

4701898,5,B005HIU9GU,"This is a fun DVD.  It also very interesting and very informative.  It takes you (kind of touge in cheek) back to the Romans and the gang, then progresses through the colonies of America, then through the Revolutionary war, then into modern times and visits varioius breweries.  All in all it is interesting and I do believe that since Beer Saved the World I should support it.",1396483200,,377,4.597014925373134
4701899,2,B005HIU9GU,"I rate 2/5 beers, as in this documentary is for people who've just had a number of beers in that range.  Most of the content is filler and asking opinions from random people on the street.  It's like some kind of experiment in committee-designed edutainment.  The gawkers who fill up a frankly annoying portion of the documentary seem to be there to either validate the viewer's reaction or to suggest what it should be.  The factual information presented herein could (and probably has been) easily fit into a YouTube video lasting no more than 3 minutes.

To summarize: Alcohol consumption is as old as agriculture. Alcohol content in beverages probably played an important role in protecting people against disease by killing pathogens.  Alcohol has been a staple of civilization for as long as it's been produced, and we have very old records to prove it.",1396396800,2,859,4.889655172413793

4701906,5,B005HIU9GU,"I had seen this little movie on Discovery channel.  It is really funny. I know most beer drinkers would love to boast of it's life saving nectar.  Saving the world stretches the truth in such a humorous way.

4701912,3,B005HIU9GU,"This was kind of entertaining. Some of it was really reaching for ""funny value"" but it was alright to have on as bakground noise while I cleaned house.

4701923,2,B005HIU9GU,My daughter loved this documentary and insisted that I watch it.  I think so many people love it because it is more entertainment and slight of hand than factual.  The connections are loose and intended to win over those that are easily amused by the idea that their favorite drink is responsible for our modern world.  I'm sure there are very real ideas and causes but one can't help but wonder how many of them are contrived for entertainment and/or a theory not fact.  It's not overly entertaining to watch but certainly do if you have time - just don't go quoting it everywhere later. :),1356220800,4,591,4.547169811320755
4701924,4,B005HIU9GU,"In a somewhat tongue-in-cheek fashion, HOW BEER SAVED THE WORLD argues the case that the invention of beer has served as a catalyst for nearly every major achievement in civilization.  Yep, that's right... From the development of the first agrarian society in 9000 B.C., to the founding of America, to advances in modern medicine, beer has allegedly played a significant role.  Presented in a humorous, light-hearted way, HOW BEER SAVED THE WORLD is a fun 30 minute presentation on the sublime history of the world's greatest beverage.
