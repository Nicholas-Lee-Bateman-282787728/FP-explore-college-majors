8024550,3,B00029NMF4,"This low budget direct to DVD does have some creepy moments, but it is saddled with some bad acting.

It has the wrap around story of two people trying to out scare each other when the power goes out. The acting is really bad here with a very predictable ending.

Story one, ""Pain Killer"" has some creepy moments, but it too suffers from over acting, poor acting, poor direction, and some painful, irreverent dialogue. Plus you also get a view through fake grass!

Story two, ""Cologne"" is just awful. Why? The lead is badly miss cast. He's a very, very poor actor and it made this one hard to sit through.

Story three, ""Blood Runs Cold"" was actually pretty good. The person who played the priest was a poor actor, but it didn't mar the story, which actually gets creepy in the vampire's lair. The lead vampire's voice reminded me of Lydia Lunch. Kind of baby doll, kind of child-like, but evil. The story is cleverly filmed in darkness, which added to the gloom and despair.

The musical score was excellent on the entire feature.",1306713600,,1031,4.551351351351351
