'I am Love' is the saga of the Recchis, a very well-off Italian family from Milan who own a textile factory. It takes about a half hour until we enter the second act of the story. Up until then, we're introduced to the family in a very over long expository scene involving a birthday party for the family patriarch, the grandfather, Edoardo Sr. Things finally pick up when the grandfather announces that he's decided to retire and cedes the ownership of the company to both his son, Tancredi, and his grandson, Edoardo Jr. Note that the grandfather disappears for the rest of the film and one wonders why we hear nothing of him later on, especially because Tancredi eventually decides to sell the textile factory, a business, which is made clear from the outset, is very dear to the old man.

The funny thing about 'I am Love' is that all of the characters are underdeveloped--some more so than others. I'll dispense with the characters which we learn almost next to nothing about, first. There's Giancarla, Tancredi's brother, who has about three lines for the entire movie. Then there's Edoardo Jr's girlfriend, Eva, who he gets married to, but I can't seem to remember the nature of their conversations. There's also Elisabetta, Tancredi's daughter, who dispenses with her handsome boyfriend and ends up in a committed lesbian relationship while attending art school in London. Finally there's veritable straw man Tancredi himself, who's depicted as a stick in the mud, and gets his comeuppance when his Russian born wife, Emma, leaves him at the end of the story.

The main plot revolves around Trancredi's wife, Emma, who falls for son Edoardo Jr's new found friend, chef Antonio. The 'chef' is the quintessential Italian lover, passionate about the two things most dear to a passionate Italian male's heart: food and sex! Emma conveniently runs into Antonio while visiting Sanremo and (shock of all shocks!), they end up making passionate love outside Antonio's house in the hills high above the picturesque town. The love-making is shot tastefully especially with juxtaposed scenes of plants undergoing pollination (also thrown in, is the busy, modernistic, John Adams score!).

Meanwhile we find out a few things about Edoardo Jr.'s situation. He's really a good guy especially when we find out how upset he is about workers being fired down at the textile factory--after all the grandfather wouldn't have done that to his workers! But the foreman points out (and this is about the most ambiguity offered up during the entire narrative), the grandfather had no qualms about conscripting Jewish slave laborers during the war. It's an interesting tidbit, but never explored. Edoardo Jr. puts up the good fight after his father decides to sell the factory to an Indian-American businessman in London. Ultimately, the company is sold and Edoardo Jr. returns home deflated.

The ending of 'I am love' not only feels tacked on--but wholly manipulative. After finding a series of clues, Edoardo Jr. deduces that his mother and Antonio have been having the affair. They argue outside a party and Edoardo somehow stumbles and hits his head on the concrete beside a pool. The doctors are unable to save him and he dies of a brain hemorrhage. After the funeral, Tancredi finds Emma alone inside the church, and consoles her by covering her with his jacket after a rainstorm. Emma reveals that she's been in love with Antonio all along and in a laughable moment, Tancredi grabs his coat back and tells her that he has disowned her. As previously mentioned, Emma gains her comeuppance by walking out on Tancredi. There's the added feel good bonus in a nod to woman's rights--just before Emma takes off, daughter Elisabetta gives her approving nod to her mother, acknowledging that she's in complete agreement with her plan to dump her father and run back to the savory chef.

For cynics such as myself, 'I am love' is all style over substance. There's nothing distinctive about Emma and Antonio's affair and I found Edoardo Jr.'s bizarre death designed to extract as many unearned tears possible from a susceptible audience. 'I am love' has some nifty cinematography and the actors all give sincere performances. Ultimately, however, this is a film which is all about the 'passion' and nothing about fully realized characters. After wimpy Tancredi gets thrown under the bus and 'passionate' lovers Emma and Antonio get a free pass as they awkwardly embrace down inside the cave at the film's end, I could only react with a two word Yiddish expletive: 'Oy vey'.",1279929600,17,4594,4.967490247074123
4214492,5,B003X1VJ1M,"Director Guadagnino carries on the Italian tradition of creating beauty. Every frame of this film must be suitable for framing. You can get lost in the stylish world of the Recchi Family, the streets of Milan or the beautiful countryside. There is wonderful attention to the behind the scenes work of the servants, how they silently and gracefully facilitate the family's life of elegance.

The Recchi family is on the threshold of change. The patriarch and head of the family business has suitably chosen a family dinner to announce that his son and grandson will now take the reigns.  His son wants to modernize and sell the business; his grandson wants to carry it on with all its benevolent traditions.

While this particular piece of glue that holds the family together is coming apart other family members are asserting their independence in different ways.  Here, the patriarch's daughter-in-law, a true outsider, a Russian beauty and his granddaughter, her daughter, follow their hearts. This is where the film's visual beauty meets with operatic passion, further illustrated in music by John Adams. The coming apart is both stunning and devastating. The films final images will stay with you for days.",1278892800,40,1210,5.095959595959596
4214493,3,B003X1VJ1M,"We saw 'I Am Love' at the 2010 Dallas Film Festival.  Beyond admiring Tilda Swinton's impressive performance (nothing short of amazing that she did the entire film in Italian and Russian - wow!), I don't think anyone knew quite what to make of this outing from writer/director Luca Guadagnino.  At an event eager to reward fine works with a round of applause, a shock of silence met the lights when they came up on this one.

I am an active watcher of arthouse releases. I am not distracted in the least by subtitles.  I count German, Israeli and Spanish films among my favorites. So, that's not the issue here.  For me, the heavily-played score from John Adams (the first film score from this Pulitzer Prize-winner) pounding (and I mean POUNDING) away over the e-x-c-r-u-c-i-a-t-i-n-g-l-y overly-long love scenes between Swinton's Emma and her young lover (the word 'interminable' seems invented for this occasion alone), sent me over the edge from marginally interested to put-out.  Have you ever seen an entire audience look away out of embarrassment or imagine a group silently pleading en masse that the director just move on?  It happened here.

The spotlight review here on this page compares this film favorably to the lush production values of Tom Ford's inaugural effort (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Single-Man/dp/B002VECLVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Single Man</a>).  But what surprised on Ford's film was not only the attention paid to the look of each frame, but to his narrative skill and focus on character development.  Yes, Colin Firth and Julianne Moore played a large part of those aspects of the film's success, but Ford showed a deft touch in moving the film along and making us care about the characters.  Guadagnino, by contrast, gets stuck on the stuffy rituals of upper class Milan, then food, and then Emma's fascination and affair.",1276300800,18,1905,5.254125412541254
4214494,5,B003X1VJ1M,"If you were somewhat skeptical of former Gucci fashion designer turned filmmaker Tom Ford's lush stylisations and emotional resonances in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Single-Man/dp/B002VECLVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Single Man</a>, then you'll hardly be convinced by the latest film from Luca Guadagnino, an Italian film director who has worked previously on promotional advertisements for Fendi.  In contrast to the stark minimalism of slow-cinema that is currently fashionable in art house cinema, the extraordinarily beautiful I Am Love, as the titles suggests, simply wallows in an excess of sensory and emotional states.

There's little about the subject that seems attractive, dealing as it does with the lives of an important rich aristocratic Recchi family from Milan, the film dwelling initially on the opulence of their lives, the exquisite furnishings of their family mansion, the elegance of their expensive clothing and the sumptuous extravagance of the haut-cuisine food they as they celebrate the birthday of the family patriarch, Edoardo.  At the dinner-party however, the grandfather hands over the running of the successful international family business to his son Tancredi (Pippo Delbono) and his grandson Edoardo Jr. (Flavio Parenti), and although this rankles somewhat, there is clearly a family unity that holds them together and is wary of admitting outsiders.

Cracks are beginning to show however and it's not just in the realities of the family business trying to keeping up-to-date with the workings of the modern business world, but it's shown also in a number of remarkably subtle ways, all of them stemming from the opening dinner-party.  Edo has been unaccountably beaten in a prestigious boating race by Antonio, the talented chef who has prepared the evening's meal, and there is a hesitancy about accepting his new girlfriend into the family; the daughter Elizabetta (Alba Rohrwacher) has broken tradition in the present she gives to her grandfather, suggesting that she is going to go her own direction in her studies and in her love life, going moreover against an alliance that she would be good for the family; but the biggest change that is to have profound consequences for the Recchi family occurs with their mother Emma (Tilda Swinton).

The suggestions made, there is however nothing subtle about how director goes about recounting the fall of the Recchi household, the subsequent delirious and tragic events depicted with all the emotional heft and complex layering of Italian grand opera (the florid minimalism of a John Adams score however giving it a much more modern flavour), with cinematic resonances that point to the Italian masters of Visconti and Antonioni.  Guadagnino however has a few tricks and innovations of his own, finding a manner to cinematically depict intense sensory impressions and experiences that is unfashionably and almost embarrassingly uninhibited.  I Am Love is an extraordinary film, an extraordinarily beautiful one, and one moreover that succeeds utterly in its creation of an interior emotional world as much as the external material world that it depicts.  It's the clash between these two worlds then that is to prove the fatal to the Recchi family, and the viewer has no option but to be similarly swept along.",1274745600,89,3345,5.492217898832685

4214496,2,B003X1VJ1M,"I don't get why everyone thinks this was amazing. It was ok at best and Tilda Swinton speaks awful Russian, why was that even IN the story?",1521676800,,139,4.185185185185185
4214497,4,B003X1VJ1M,"Checked this out on the merit of Luca Guadagnino's breakthrough film, Call Me By Your Name, in the interest of exploring some his past work. In some ways, I Am Love feels like a dry run for the former, particularly in its second act which is by far its strongest. It captures that same windswept, naturalistic intimacy shared between two characters who are hopelessly drawn to one another despite the social pressures that would pull them apart. Guadagnino displays the same eye for the beauty of the Italian countryside which again acts as a backdrop, and he too adorns the romance with plentiful images of the natural world.

But these similarities to Call Me By Your Name are also somewhat detrimental to the film as they draw just as much attention to the ways in which it doesn't quite reach those same heights. The characters here don't feel as rounded and full-bodied which distanced me a bit from the proceedings. There are also many more plot elements revolving around the more numerous supporting characters that fail to be as compelling as the central romance. Additionally, I took some issue with the third act of the film which veers into melodrama and results in a finale that feels forced compared to the breezy, airy quality of its earlier sections. Still, there's plenty of beauty to behold here and it's worth seeing as a formative work in Guadagnino's career, as well as on the strength of its best moments.

4214501,5,B003X1VJ1M,"A beautiful film by Luca Guadagnino. Tilda Swinton is amazing to watch. Emotionally understated so that we are in the story with them, rather than having it be explained to us. It's a story of longing, of a deep relationship between mother and son, a distant marriage that leads her to finding herself again in the love and beauty of someone else. Her mirror with her daughter for standing for what they really desire without apology is sweet.

4214508,3,B003X1VJ1M,"At first this movies appears to be a long weird predictable seen-it-before formulaic movie about a woman who has an affaire and leaves her husband. But no one can be that goofy. So I think this movie was a subversive pro-gay message. The daughter leaves her boyfriend, cuts her hair off, dates a woman, and comes out as gay. This is the turning point in the film where the mother makes her move to ""be free"" and ""express herself"" too. I""m guessing a movie centered around all-gay themes would be overkill. So they took a stock plot and dressed it up a little to make it more universally acceptable. After all the movie was made right about the gay marriage push around the globe. I don't think that is a coincidence.

The movie is quirky . . . . There is loud modern classical music played at dramatic points of the film. People are very spastic and take fits of emotion at dramatic point in the film. There are strange cutaways at dramatic points of the film. There are intentionally out of focus moments in the film. For example, the married adulterer is having sex with her young lover in the woods. You s ee a thigh one minute. Then you see butterflies dancing on flowers another. You see an arm the next minute. You see bees buzzing the next. You see birds and then a breast. Etc etc. It just very strange. There was one moment I seriously thought there was something wrong with me. The camera was so out of focus it was blurry. I was like . . . what is that . . . what are they showing? The way they held the camera on it I thought it was important. Then BOOM there is a man's face in focus up close and personal. I literally laughed out loud. The final seen with this dizzying modern classical music of violins and trumpets was played as the maid ran to and fro while the woman threw her clothes in a suitcase as she left her family/husband for her lover. It was almost like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The entire episode around the son's death was just odd. The scene where the son's wife or gf at the funeral stood up and rubbed her stomach as she called the people's names in the room was just strange.

I guess the most positive thing I can say for this film is it was beautiful--visually. The furnishing down the doors and stairs was excellent. The lunch party reminded me of the British period pieces that took place in the palaces of the duke/duchesses/lord/ladies with the full staff making sure every last detail was in place. The clothes. The people. It is the first Italian film I've seen where the people are not sweaty people with  a ruddy complexion where women are pulling hair in the streets as the husbands have sex with a prostitute in a work truck while wearing a ""wife beater"" tee shirt.",1492300800,,2708,4.358415841584159

This is a true work of Italian Art cinema I can die for !
Tilda Swinton spoke Italian for the first time, Tinda Swinton exposes everything gladly without any hestiation although she is not 20s anymore showing she is still so so beautiful.

Luca Guadagnino an Italian director who just released his new film A BIGGER SPLASH made us explores his new world of luxurious Italian cinema just like his buddy Paolo Sorrentino <THE CONSQEUENCES OF LOVE, THE GREAT BEAUTY> he gestures with his fingers to show his own world for the first time the world that has never been revealed before the world of exquisite music that you will never forget compsed by John Adams <THIN RED LINE><RUN LOLA RUN><BIRDMAN>.

The utmost beauty of camera work done by Yorick Le Saux <ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE><SWIMMING POOL><SITCOM><SEE THE SEA> worked with Franois Ozon ans so on.

And I souldn't forget to mention the location of the beautiful landscape of Italy.
The loocal and city together.
The huge beautiful houses and small mundane humle but old fashioned ones that you will feel cosy for all times.
The art of cooling by Tilda's lover who is her son't friend she falls in love with. The trouble she made by falling in love that made verything go down.
Who made her most beloved son killed, the I doono 40 years of marriage brocker, the new era of new love beginner the guy who has the most talented in cooking the masterful cook who is about to open a restaurant with Tilda's son.

You've seen enough about an old woman having an affair with a young man?
Adrian Lyne's UNFAITHFUL? Nope nothing like this film.
It's just pure work of art.
The one she can throw herself to the fire just to achieve this love.

From her elegance, the clothing, her bearing, her striking gazes...the woman is exquisite piece of art!, a joy to behold!... no matter her age.  This is HER film,  without would be an utter and complete BUST.  She was the only one that mattered to me (though Ida the head staff person I enjoyed also).  The others left no mark on me.

I found the music crescendos to be overused at certain points, and becoming childish and annoying.

Many reviewers talk about the ""emotionality"" of the film.  I can see why they would say that, but I did not FEEL that.  Me, the most emotional person, crying at the drop of a hat,  was strangely unaffected by anything any of these characters did, even Tilda.  I had no feeling of emotion at all, just an appreciation of loveliness, even when Edo died (I am a mother and grandmother) I felt absolutely nothing, which I regard a fail on the part of the producers/directors.  Perhaps they spent all their time on elegance and sophisticated subtlety and missed the most basic boat of TRUE FEELING.  Had they achieved that, in my mind, this would have won awards.

4214562,5,B003X1VJ1M,"I will admit that I cannot any movie featuring actress Tilda Swinton.  Since her movie ""Orlando"" that skyrocketed her career I could not ignore anything about this actress - not her works of art in the movies, not her personal life that is just as complicated as most of her roles.  Finally, I picked this movie because she plays a role of a Russian beauty, who is married to a wealthy man from Italian family with fortune in the textile industry.  They live in Milan, the heart of Italian fashion and everyone in this film , especially Ricchi family that the story is about is impeccably dressed.

But this is not just a film about wealth, and manners and parties.  It is a film about awakening of a woman who for decades was devoted wife and a mother that she ignored her own needs.  She took care of the family by making sure their life flows, whether it is a party, or a family gathering, or her children's education.  Unexpectedly, when she meets her son's best friend one day, both of them fall for each other.  This is not an ordinary affair.  It is an affair of two people who adore beauty and nature and who are not willing ot ignore their sincere emotions.

As tragedy strikes one day, Tilda's character Emma makes a decision that will shake her entire family to the core.  As it is most of the time in life, it is deeply traumatic experiences that give us a momentum to make the most bold decisions in our lives.  It is when we have nothing more to loose that we are willing to take a deep dive in the unknown.  Only Emma in this movie is so lucky that there is someone for her to catch her.

It is beautiful film made in a European tradition.  In the film, Tilda Swinton speaks Italian and Russian and she is so comfortable with it as if both are her native languages.  And her beauty flows with the film, from sophisticated elegance to casual charm that is irresistble in its mystery and simple innate charm only a few are born with.  Even in her grief, she is mesmerizing to watch.

I adore this movie.  Watching it was like reading family saga's novel ""Red and Black"".  It moves at its own pace only to have an explosive end.  It touches up on Italian sensibility and a soul of a deeply and touchingly emotional Slavic person.",1415750400,,2241,4.3647342995169085

4214580,3,B003X1VJ1M,"I like Tilda Swinton because she seemed very kind in an interview on Chinese television where she promoted a film festival.  I also enjoyed her last scene with George Clooney in the film ""Michael Clinton.""

This movie starts with some Architectural Digest-worthy scenes of deep private Italian wealth.  There are some brief glimpses at creative cooking and more importantly, how Tilda Swinton's character is awoken by the creative cooking of a young enough to be her son, more Southern. more Mediterranean Italian.  They seem like nice and vulnerable people individually so one would feel safe in either of their company. I wouldn't think they had any chemistry but more importantly, I don't care.  And that is a communication of this film - they shoot many scenes as if from hidden cameras as if  seen by voyeurs i.e. the audience.  More obviously to me in Korean entertainment than in English-language products but definitely in David Tennant's film with Kelly McDonald aka Doctor Who and Merida respectively - I thought wow, I don't want to know, they wouldn't want outsiders to know and see if this were real and they definitely don't want to be doing this scene where David Tennant iirc dried Merida's back.

And that is how the scenes for Tilda Swinton and her costar are shot - unlike what I saw of Naomi Watts and Robin Wright's soap opera-stye scenes of intimacy in ""Adore"" in that they were paid to play.

So what is up with this movie other than an indictment of love scenes?

Deep into the film, we learn that the wealth of the Recchis includes the shame of conspiring with the ""regime"" and using Jewish workers which can only mean WW2 and using people who were marked for death.

This is a textile family so before the Big Reveal, I thought they were Jewish but perhaps not or perhaps they were able to hide their ancestry but still they collaborated and not necessarily to save lives meaning they were Holocaust profiteers.  So that adjusted my mind about what I was watching.

Alrighty.

So we have invasion of privacy, we have rooms filled with Rape of Europa and China touches which may remind one of the Nahtzee flag with was the reverse of the Japanese flag and added the Buddhist swastiza.

So if they got their temporary partner to do the Chinese version of the dirty work taking place in Europe, once the land had been ""cleared,"" then the Seven Years in Tibet types would storm down to the plateau and take away their frenemy's accomplishment hence the preparatory flag.

So why did these efficiency experts take the time and money to make sure a waiter and his infirm father and his little boy got on the train to Auschwitz?

There's no money in it.  They didn't offend anyone.  They weren't sticking out in the landscape and ruining the view of an Aryan world, correct?  And they definitely would not rise up like some kind of supernatural and take away the wealth of Tilda Swinton's in-laws.

So look at the map and know that since early times, Israel kept getting attacked not because of offensiveness but location.  It's not about crazy hatred of one group - it's about a ruthless removal of CLAIMANTS to an ancestral land that remains the missing puzzle piece to a fascist monopoly of a region and that region is the stepping off point to Africa hence ""The English Patient"" operatives.

Murder is very effective.  It absolutely does work to remove dissenting opinion, do-gooders and more importantly, rightful owners or descendants of real estate.

And that would indicate that there is a WW point to making this film because Tilda Swinton doesn't take glamour roles.  She only makes movies that make a necessary point about something.

And that means Iris Chang's sequel was more important than Rape of Nanking because she was collecting eyewitness testimony including from censored American POWs who were eager to speak about what had been suppressed.  No one has connected the dots that outside of China, the Chinese were being hunted.  Their predators may have been reserving the Koreans as slave labor but the Chinese collaborators would not have been long for this world once their Master got what he needed.  It was always about removal from ancestral real estate and that is why the sequel was the one that was going to matter.",1397952000,,4263,4.760544217687075

It is not the credible body of a woman who has had three children, however well preserved she may be.  I found it hard to believe that she would show herself nude in broad daylight to any lover.

Other reviews have commented that the subject matter is unnatractive or just plain boring - the inner lives and downfall of a family... I didn't find it so. I think the issue is that the expectation is of a cookie-cutter beautiful Italian countryside confection. This movie isn't that. The director accomplishes, in some instances, a tremendous amount with very little dialogue. It is the subtlety that makes this movie interesting. This movie reminds one of the great italian directors. Yes, it is beautiful. And yes, you do see the innards of a modern Italian villa, and that is interesting in itself.

Here, mother and daughter do too.  A spectacular performance by Tilda Swenton is nearly undone by the director's obsession with the artsy and the fartsy.  There are lots of sweet music, blurred photography and  close ups of bugs, flowers and human skin pores.  Tilda gets naked and sweaty in one scene, but the cameraman and director seem all but obsessed with showing that Ms. Swenton's boobs aren't quite perfect.

Emma (Swenton) is a Russian migr married to a wealthy Italian business man.  As her children grow up, she seems longing for her native land and a little hanky panky on the side.  She takes up with a younger chef and best friend of her oldest son.  I just didn't buy it.  Tragedy ensues and Emma must make some life changing decisions.  Silly stuff really.  So, this movie is not the cinematic masterpiece many critics have suggested but is a masterpiece in acting by Tilda Swenton and that alone elevates the film.

Blu ray is a 1080p transfer in 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  A movie like this with sumptuous landscapes and food presentations should receive a top shelf look.

4214606,3,B003X1VJ1M,"What do you expect from a film titled ""I Am Love"" (original Italian title ""Io sono l'amore"") starring Tilda Swinton as a discontented wife of a rich family falling in love with a chef (and friend of her son)? Art-house film? Yes, but with an obvious nod to old-fashioned melodramas (Douglas Sirk, for instance), the film is more like a two-hour soap opera created with visual style and symbolism. Some might find it absorbing while others preposterous. Me? I still don't know whether I should really take the film seriously or not.

The story is pretty simple. Russian-born Emma (Tilda Swinton) is the dutiful wife of Tancredi Recchithe (Pippo Delbono), married into the wealthy Recchi clan in Milan. One day their son Edoardo (Flavio Parenti) introduces Emma to a chef named Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), to whom Emma gets romatically attracted. In the meanwhile, Emma's daughter Elisabetta Recchi (Alba Rohrwacher) has a secret to hide from other family members.

You will spot the film's symbolism here and there - contrast of the cold streets of Milan and the warm Son Remo is just one of them - but for all the film's intelligence and stylish camera work, the story is too slow-moving and, well, when it's fast, it is often very silly. Tilda Swinton (also a co-producer) delivers strong acting, and Oscar-nominated costume designs are something worth watching, but the beautifully-shot film lacks something that draws us emotionally into the film's world. In spite of (or because of) the style of the film, the entire love story looks detached.

""I Am Love"" is a kind of film you either dismiss as silly and unrealistic, or find fascinating, talking about its messages or visual techniques after watching it. Somehow I was not much impressed with the film because of the visual flair and John Adams soundtrack (themselves fine, though) that are too ""I Am Love"", preventing us from identifying with the characters.

4214610,4,B003X1VJ1M,"Some Amazonians have criticized I Am Love as melodramatic, stilted or a costume drama, complaining about a lack of realism.  I wonder how they can square that against, say, various Shakespeare classics or musicals or cartoons, even.  I can assure each reviewer that just outside the boundaries of the viewer's screen are about one hundred grips, techs and A/V workers.  Unlike music, film is intrinsically a medium of artifice.  Everyone you see is pretending (or ""acting"" if you will).

I found the film's direction to be expressive but varying.  During the middle third, the seduction parts, Guadagnino loses focus (literally) just as Emma does and he abstains from the Steadicam, just as Emma does, I guess.  During the final part there are some incredible set pieces: cutting during the ukha dinner scene that rivals Hitchcock and a riveting confrontation between Emma and Edo by the pool where they speak Russian for the first time.  Knock-out scene.

In the climactic scene, Emma prepares to depart the family home for her lover, Antonio, and seeks assent from her daughter Betta.  Betta (""now we have more money"") leads a carefree lesbian life in London and is a puzzling choice to absolve Emma of her wedding vows.

4214613,4,B003X1VJ1M,"""I Am Love"" is a family drama that's as laidback and seductive as the lush, gently rolling Italian countryside in which it`s set - until all hell breaks loose in the final reel, that is.

Tilda Swinton plays Emma Recchi, a Russian migr whose husband, Tancredi (Pippo Delbono), and son, Edoardo (Flavio Parente), are co-owners of the family business, a textile factory in Milan.  While they're busy doing their thing, Emma starts up an affair with Edoardo's best friend and business partner, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), a master chef who's looking to open up his own restaurant with Edo's financial backing.

Though the story sounds as if it came straight out of a telenovela (or the Italian equivalent thereof), co-writer Barbara Alberti and writer/director Luca Guadagnino manage to elevate it enough in quality and tone to expunge it of some of its more blatantly obvious ""soap opera"" elements.

The personal drama takes place against the backdrop of the family`s business interests, as Tancredi and Edoardo bicker over whether or not to sell the company.  But the primary focus is on Emma, as she subtly rebels against the confines of a stale, loveless marriage, her lack of personal identity (she was even assigned a new name by Tancredi when he brought her from Russia), and the ""good little wife"" faade she displays to the world.  But the fates or the gods can be unforgiving taskmasters, and Emma is eventually required to pay big time for her transgression, with the story taking a tragic turn near the end, at which point it turns all ""A Doll's House"" on us, albeit ratcheted it up to the nth degree.

In the final analysis, ""I Am Love"" turns out to be much ado about not all that much in the end, but strong performances and a flavorful atmosphere make it worth checking out.",1299024000,,1789,4.807817589576548
4214614,5,B003X1VJ1M,"On the surface this is a film about a wealthy multigenerational family in Milan; the story line seems simple and classical. The wife of the middle generation - Tilda Swinton - becomes enraptured with a younger man, her son's best friend, and they embark upon a highly sensual affair which inevitably brings ruin to the family. A little bit of Lady Chatterley's lover.

But there is much below the surface here and a subtle political tilt. It is mentioned that the fabric factory which is the source of the family wealth is fundamentally, as a a capitalist enterprise, exploitative, and that during WWII, Jewish slave labor was used during the Nazi occupation. Shudder. The contrast between the perfectly turned out family and the dark origins of their wealth echoes the classic Italian film ""Last Year at Marienbad"" which also dwelt on the 'lifestyles of the rich and famous' as trappings representing a failed way of life. When Swinton's character breaks out of the precision of her privileged but unfulfilling life at the villa and gives herself to her much younger lover, we see she has chosen natural joy over a rigid, empty life.

The structure of the movie is dense enough with these hints to repay viewing more than once. Beyond all that, there is exquisite filmaking artisty. Director Luca Guadagnino's visuals (Yorick Le Saux was the cinematographer) are remarkable, every shot a work of art, perfectly framed and colored, and perfectly timed to convey subtle interactions and moods, a two-hour course in state of the art filmaking. Anyone with a love of photography or film art will take great pleasure in this movie, a feast for the eye. The John Adams soundtrack is also highly original and adds to the overall effect.

Ms. Swinton had a major hand in writing and producing this movie and it follows her interests. It is known that in her personal life she maintains both a husband her age and a young boyfriend. It is also known she once belonged to the Communist Party of Great Britain.

This was not a box office blockbuster, but I predict this movie will be studied in film schools in future years as a carefully thought out and magnificently realized work of art - much better than Marienbad. For film buffs, highly recommended.",1298332800,5,2245,4.823376623376624

4214618,3,B003X1VJ1M,"For a film as beautifully shot and splendidly acted as `Io Sono L'amore', it is disappointing for me to find the film almost void of all intended poignancy.  This sites reviewer mentions a balance between sublime and silly, and I totally concur with the argument that this particular film struggles to juggle both `apposing' factions.  The sublime is easy to identify, while the underscored `silly' notions are the most memorable and thus the most deafening factors allocated with this film.

So I'll break those down.

The `sublime':

Tilda Swinton is ridiculously amazing here.  I think that this woman, this creature, this goddess from the heavens is rapidly becoming my favorite working actress.  She can do no wrong and she can do nearly anything.  What she does with her character, that of Emma Recchi, is marvelous.  She attains such rich character development without raising an octave or engaging in normal Oscar baiting.  She understands how to evoke countless emotions with just the minor movements in her face.  The film is also lavishly shot.  The sets are outstanding to look at and the costumes (I feel funny calling `clothes' costumes but whatever) are stunning.  It's funny, but I still remember that `green dress' from `Atonement' like I was staring at it this very moment, and I feel that three years from now I'll still remember that `orange dress' from this film as well.  I loved the films general direction as well, and the sharp editing that made the film feel so exotic and consuming.

That said; the `silly':

I have this issue with food and romance, but I'm not even going to get into that, since it's too obvious.  My real issue with `Io Sono L'amore' boils all the way down to the films final frames; the conclusion.  This is why I can't really `get into it' and maybe you should just take my word for it, but then again I am a firm believer in not taking ANYONE'S word for anything, so you really should see this movie (even if I have my reservations, Tilda should be up for the Oscar this year).  I'll just say that the way in which Emma's characters final climactic resolve is unveiled is just way too, melodramatic.  For a film that is so subtle and soft and reserved, allowing the emotional presence to sift quietly beneath the intoxicatingly vibrant backdrops, the ending comes as a gigantic slap in the face and is so abrasive that it feels like it's been pulled from a different film.  Maybe that was the point, and I was ready and willing to forgive it until it went all sorts of soap opera thematic with the final `fleeing' moment that I found myself rolling my eyes at all the clichd dramatizations.  It was a horrifically constructed mess.

Seriously.

In the end I kind of forgive it, but I can't love it like I wanted to.  It's sad when a single moment in a film can basically derail and quite frankly ruin the whole thing.",1293408000,4,2866,4.650099403578529

4214621,5,B003X1VJ1M,"A tall, fine-boned woman with shining blond hair polishes a bowl made of gold. She stands relaxed, as servants bustle about the room--the golden woman calmly polishing the golden bowl. It is an arresting, precise image, the first we see of Emma Recchi, played by the ever more astonishing Tilda Swinton in the film ""I Am Love,"" written and directed by Luca Guadagnino. Swinton and Guadagnino spent seven years developing the story and the characters, and the result is a film of subtle cues and implications, a family drama Shakespearean in complexity and firmly rooted in Greek tragedy. Although the Recchi family is Italian haute bourgeoisie, their attitudes and actions carry the weight of royalty. As the story unfolds it becomes clear that much is expected in this family and that there are consequences for those who disappoint or defy those expectations, that there are people who matter and those who do not, and, more than anything else, that freedom is both glorious and terrible, and always comes with a price.

After the opening collage of stern, stone facades of a Milan deep in the grey of winter, the interior of the Recchi villa is aglow with rich, warm color. As the servants and Emma work to prepare the table for dinner the family gathers, chatting about the unexpected loss of a race by the eldest son, Edo, to a man no one has heard of--the first disappointment of the evening (Recchis do not lose). Dinner is being prepared for the birthday celebration of the pater familias, Edoardo Recchi, Sr. Around the long table are his family: his wife, Allegra; eldest son, Tancredi, and his wife, Emma; Edo, the eldest son and prodigal, the hope of the family, and the child closest to his mother's heart; younger son, Gianluca; the youngest child, daughter Elisabetta, and a few others who seem to be both family and business connections. Edo has also brought home a new girlfriend, Eva. The calm of this perfect dinner, enjoyed by the perfect family, is unexpectedly ruffled when Edoardo, who has chosen this occasion to announce his successor in the family textile business, tells Tancredi he will share power with Edo as it ""will take two men to replace him."" This is a King passing on his crown, and he is insistent that the dynasty continue--the business must always be carried on by Recchis. It is all too obvious that he finds his own son not quite up to the mark, but trusts his grandson, Edo, who values the business for itself rather than merely for the fortune it has engendered.

Later, Elisabetta gives her grandfather his birthday gift and it emerges that, despite the appearance of family unity, there are other forces at work. Betta has been a painter but has made a gift of a photograph on this occasion; her grandfather is amused and tolerant, but claims that she still ""owes"" him a painting--she is a painter who should not waste her time on nonsense. Only Emma loves the photograph and reassures Betta of its value, but the feeling remains of a thread having been pulled loose from the family tapestry (later we will learn just how far from her narrow family she has gone). After dinner we meet Antonio, the chef who beat Edo earlier that day, when he arrives at the villa with a hand-made cake, a gift for Edo. He is received by him and his mother, who is struck by the gesture. Emma asks him in but he is aware that he is not of their class and retreats quickly, although later, Edo will pull that loosened thread further by going outside of his class to become Tonio's close friend and business partner.

This important dinner is just the first of the film's many meals; in this story, food is a force which binds people together and is rich with meaning, literal and symbolic. A lunch or dinner can change a person's life irrevocably; a bowl of soup can communicate love or signal a betrayal, and those who prepare food are different from those who merely eat it.

A few months later, at the height of summer, Emma meets her (now widowed) mother-in-law and new daughter-in-law (Edo has married his girlfriend) at Antonio's family's restaurant, where she experiences sensory overload as she tastes the shrimp Tonio has prepared for her. The sound fades and lights dim around her and she is spotlighted as she eats slowly, savoring every subtle flavor. It is a breathtaking moment, the center of the film; somehow, these mouthfuls of food have woken her up--her senses come alive for the first time, perhaps, in years. She tastes ecstasy. This moment will lead Emma on a new path; the next time she sees Tonio she will follow him (in what may be the year's best chase scene) until they collide and he takes her to his home high above San Remo, where he lives in natural splendor on a verdant hillside, a far cry from the studied, artificial perfection of the Recchi villa in Milan. They become lovers, and the rest of the film's action derives from that one decision; through it, Emma will shake the Recchi family to its core.

Up to this point, Guadagnino has kept strict control of time--we know where and when we are as we follow Betta's unfolding story in London and Edo's journey through the business world as he opposes his father and brother when they want to sell the company--but while Emma is with Tonio, time is fluid, elongated. She seems to spend days, even weeks with him (Edo will come looking for his friend and find no sign of him). They make love in a meadow, cut her perfectly coiffed hair short, curl up inside a cave high up in the hills. She teaches him to make ukha, the traditional Russian soup she learnt to make as a young girl in her native country, and tells Tonio about herself: with irony, she tells how Tancredi found her while he was treasure-hunting in Russia. She tells Tonio of how Edo loves her Russian-ness (they speak Russian together, while no one else in the family has bothered to learn it), and loves her ukha. It is a special treat she prepares for him (it was served at his grandfather's birthday dinner). We learn that her name isn't Emma at all--Tancredi decided to call her that--and she claims not to remember her real name, only a childhood nickname. She has made herself over entirely to become Emma Recchi, a fictitious person living a life that takes no account of who she really is. Through her relationship with Tonio her true self begins to emerge. Emma, who before shone with the buffed polish of that bowl she held earlier, now glows with sunshine and joy. This entire sequence is a foray into D.H. Lawrence territory, not just in its sensuality, but in making the argument that Tonio, the natural man, is a deeper, realer, and in every sense better man than the mechanical Tancredi. It is a dangerous edge for the director to walk, but Swinton's earthy performance grounds the sequence concretely--we never, for a moment, disbelieve Emma's reawakening to life; she seems to be breathing the air for the very first time. It is when she tries to bring this newly alive self home to the Recchi villa that she finds herself out of joint, unable to control the ways in which this new-found relationship rebounds on her family. Tragedy is inevitable, and so thoroughly has the film embraced food as the means of meaningful communication that we are not surprised when the fatal blow is delivered via a bowl of ukha. That blow is swift and dreadful; the thread that Betta first tweaked has been pulled too loose; the once flawless tapestry unravels completely. But in the end it is that selfsame thread which becomes Emma's lifeline, delivering her intact.

Tilda Swinton's performance is simply extraordinary; she has become a force of nature. Her iconic appearances in Derek Jarman's ""Edward II"" and Sally Potter's sumptuous ""Orlando"" were early training for the regal cool required for this role. More recently we've seen her as the lonely wife hungry for sexual intensity in ""Young Adam,"" the passionately protective mother in ""The Deep End,"" and, in ""Michael Clayton,"" the brittle, ferocious attorney who can contract out a couple of murders and still get on with her day. In this film, speaking both Italian and Russian, she moves effortlessly from the immaculate businessman's wife to the abandoned sensualist who gives in to love completely, without ever sounding a false note. She shows not a trace of discomfort or self-consciousness as, at nearly fifty years old, she lies naked in the Italian sun, and, when grief overwhelms Emma, she makes herself even more naked, stripped bare by bewildered shock. The film is unimaginable without her.

Lushly photographed by Yorick Le Saux, with an energetic and unusual score by John Adams, with excellent performances by all, especially Maria Paiato as Emma's faithful maid, Gabriele Ferzetti as Edoardo, Sr., Marisa Berenson as Allegra, Flavio Parenti as Edo, and Edoardo Gaberiellini as Tonio, ""I Am Love"" is, in every sense of the word, a feast.",1289520000,44,8888,4.7488673139158575

About twenty years ago Tancredi Recchi (Pippo Delbono), on an art buying trip, met a Russian girl and 'added' her to his collection, changing her name and position in life to Emma (Tilda Swinton).  Emma became the genteel and sterile hostess of the Villa, producing two children - Elisabetta (Alba Rohrwacher), an artist, and Edoardo, Jr (Flavio Parenti), a practical lad ready to enter the plastic life of this father.  The paterfamilias, Edoardo Sr. (Gabriele Ferzetti) has a birthday party and announces his retirement, leaving the company business in the joint hands of Tancredi and Edorado, Jr. Edoardo Sr. soon dies and the company is a focus for outsiders to purchase.  Meanwhile, Edoardo, Jr has lost a sports event with a young common lad, the simple chef  Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini) and Antonio visits the Villa with a cake for Edoardo, jr  - a gesture from his hands of simple kindness.  Emma meets Antonio and buried emotions of passion begin to emerge, controlled of course.  Time passes and Elisabetta (now Betta) meets a woman, falls in love, and thus rejects the advances of the 'proper, designated' boyfriend, confessing to her very understanding mother that she is lesbian and wants to pursue her own goals outside the family.  Emma, always supported by her devoted maid Ida (Maria Paiato), begins to respond to the raw but deeply suppressed emotions she so desires.  She begins an affair with Antonio (now Edoardo's best friend and one with whom he wants to open a restaurant outside of Milan) and when Eduardo discovers the affair he feels betrayed by the mother he so deeply loves and during a confrontation with Emma he accidently falls and dies.  The Recchi family's manufactured Milanese cocoon is broken and Emma, though devastated by the loss of her beloved son, departs the family for Antonio's grotto.

The film was planned for almost eleven years as a project by Tilda Swinton and writer/director Luca Guadagino (we learn from the DVD featurettes).  Not only was the story of the disease of capitalism and the disregard for the people who live by the work of their hands an important aspect of the film, but also such aspects as the musical score for this dream project was a joint dream: both love the music of John Adams and when they shared their vision with Adams, he immediately jumped in and wrote both original music for the opening but also excerpted moments from his 'Piano Rolls', dances from 'Nixon in China', 'Harmonielehre' and the breathtaking 'Harmonium' whose choral parts provide a stunning ending.  He also elected to have the last movement, 'Das himmlische Leben', from Mahler's 4th Symphony serve as the background music for the large party sequence - subtle additions.  The camera is used in extraordinary ways, allowing some of the action to be intentionally out of focus, bathing the sexual encounter between Emma and Antonio in voluptuous and sensitively private lighting.  While there is not a weak actor in the cast, the role of the Russian migr Emma (spoken completely in Italian) who manages to break out of the manufactured confines of the wealthy family she married into to become a women capable of returning to the reality of her roots - as portrayed by  Tilda Swinton - will assuredly go down in cinematic history as one of the most impressive performances ever.

The film is long, does not follow a rigid sequential line, begs for our participation in the awakening of senses, is in Italian with English subtitles, and is very subtle.  It will not appeal to everyone.  But to those who respect the brilliance of the creators this will be a film that will remain in the mind forever.

4214627,5,B003X1VJ1M,I literally gasped aloud at one point during the film. I must watch it again soon. Swinton is a marvel.,1286755200,2,103,4.2
4214628,4,B003X1VJ1M,"Luca Guadagnino's ""I Am Love"" is the work of a director who loves lush, deliberate overstatement for its own sake and doesn't give a darn if you don't. From the opening credits, in which Yorick Le Saux's camera sweeps over a wintry, twilight Milan to the swooping, pulsing music of John Adams, you know you're in for a delirious time.

Guadagnino is so cocky that he doesn't introduce the true theme of the film until nearly halfway through, and he does so by having his protagonist, Emma (Tilda Swinton), take a bite from a plate of prawns. From that point, her controlled, privileged life goes out the window, with an abandon that makes ""La Traviata"" look like ""Our Town."" With her russet hair and huge pale eyes, Swinton has a rare gift for portraying desire, and in Emma Guadagnino has given her a character who is pretty much all desire.

""I Am Love"" will antagonize many viewers who will find it slow, precious and self-indulgent. It reminds me strongly of Francois Girard's ""Silk,"" another film that risks a slow, pictorial buildup to draw audiences into a rarefied world of senses and feelings, and which also antagonizes many viewers. If you're in the right mood, however, ""I Am Love"" should draw you in completely.",1285372800,4,1224,4.741784037558685
4214629,5,B003X1VJ1M,"This is a different film where the language is much less important (in fact quite sparse) than the esthetics of the visual impressions. It starts quite slow and the pace of the storytelling intensify until it ends in real crescendo, both the plot, the music and visually. It is dealing with passion and troublesome relationships.

In a way the film has biblical proportions. I saw it at the cinema and I think this is a film that is at its best here. No one in the audience even drew their breath at the end - it was complete silence for a good long time when the rolling titles came on. The music was also wonderful and so well adapted to the plot.

Different in a good way - watch it!",1285286400,,686,4.269230769230769
4214630,5,B003X1VJ1M,"The intoxicating I Am Love (Io sono l'amore) begins in winter. On a gray Milan day, snow encases the Recchis' villa. But inside, the abode is glorious and bustling. Emma (Tilda Swinton) works with her servants to prepare a dinner in which her father-in-law (Gabriele Ferzetti) will name the successor to his business. Emma's beautiful family arrives one by one, and the banquet proceeds.

No one seems to fit more into the Recchis' immaculate lifestyle than Emma, a Russian transplant. She is close to her children, especially her confiding daughter Elisabetta (Alba Rohrwacher) and oldest son Edoardo (Flavio Parenti). He works for the Recchi business and supports his best friend Antonio's (Edoardo Gabbriellini) efforts to start a new restaurant. Emma attends Antonio's family restaurant where his cooking affects her like an aphrodisiac.

I Am Love is a hypnotic addition to the oft told story of a woman's awakening. As the film moves into and through the heights and depths of summer weather, several characters embark on a journey of self discovery and freedom. The dazzling score, featuring many pieces by John Adams, is as much a part of the movie as its imagery. While there are subtle commentaries on character, globalization, and classism, much of the symbolism is obvious. Birds flutter against church ceilings; moths fight against lamp shades. Gourmet food, naked bodies, and edenic scenery are lovingly illuminated.

Because the dialogue is occasionally clich, I Am Love works best when no explanations are given. Tilda Swinton is superb, and the attractive supporting cast is excellent. Italian director Luca Guadagnino's highly dramatic film is not for everyone, but some will adore this sweeping symphony of transformation and love.",1285113600,4,1750,5.287769784172662
4214631,1,B003X1VJ1M,"So was ""I am Love"" about, hmm? Many things. So many things. The movie was like watching fireworks. First a spark sets off in one direction. Then it flashes to another. Then an explosion! Then a second. Then silence. Then BOOM BOOM BOOM! A thunderous ovation of pointless noise. BEWARE: Plot spoilers below!

The movie started with a family dinner at a beautiful Italian villa, with Grandpa preparing to announce which one of his three grandchildren will inherit his factory and fortune. That decision, which basically cut off two of three siblings from enormous wealth, was remarkably undramatic. Lost a fortune? Pass the prosciutto! But ah! Lithe and lovely Mama intercepts love letters from her daughter to another woman! Mama mia! She climbs to the top of a church and ponders. A grandson is hanging out with a Hairy Young Chef who cooks divine cuisine. They want to start a ""ristorante"" two hours outside a remote village. But Papa says no! As he should - who needs to drive into the puckerbrush for some linguine, however celestial? Mama grew up in Russia. This has no bearing on the plot, allows her a lonely wistfulness. But no! Hairy Young Chef has the hots for Mama! He cuts her hair! They go hiking! They fornicate for long, uncomfortable minutes! They dress and she teaches him to make a family favorite -- fish soup with Very Clear Broth. It is served when HYC is invited to cook for ""la familia."" The family dish, cooked by a stranger -- the affair is discovered! Betrayal! A death ensues. Guilt! Mom confesses love for HYC to stoic, stolid Papa, in a church no less. Basta! Papa gives her the boot. To an unbearably loud climactic musical fanfare, she packs her bag, sobs with the maid and is gone. Finis!

If any of the above makes any sense, I'm sorry. Every scene is a potential red herring, leading one to believe that there is actually a plot lurking beneath the constant stream of images and dialog.  Watching this 2-hour exercise in confusion was painful. When will it end?, we asked ourselves. The bizarre touches were incredible. In the aforementioned love scene, the director cut between close ups of the lovers and scenes of nature. No biggie. Done all the time to suggest the beauty of the sexual act. But here, nature came in the form of bugs. Close-up of lovers, then a bug. Then another close-up, then another bug. And on and on. And drool! Two females kiss, open-mouthed, then separate, a foot-long string of saliva dangling from their eager mouths. Must be a turn-on on the Continent.

When the film was over, my wife and I laughed hysterically for minutes. I'm sure others will think this film profound, but a would love to rate it a zero. Ciao, bambini!!",1283990400,22,2687,4.674418604651163
4214632,5,B003X1VJ1M,"This movie is like a sophisticated meal that takes time to consume, its not fast food with instant gratification. Nothing is handed to you as far as plot like ordinary Hollywood stuff, rather you are just a silent witness to the unfolding lives of the people involved. It is a slow, deliberate but delicious unfolding of the story, and like any good meal, a fantastic dessert at the end. It wasn't until I consumed the whole meal could I express `I LOVE THIS MOVIE!'  I left the theater in an altered state for several hours which to me is always a sign of a fantastic film. Tilda Swinton is just phenomenal as she is in anything she does. One of the best movies I have seen in the last few years, SO refreshing to view a movie that isn't a cookie cutter production of everything else. A true art movie, as with all true art movies, some people just won't get it and feel the need to pan, but if you are in the group that appreciates this movie, then you are a creative artistic passionate soul!",1282089600,35,995,4.320855614973262
4214633,1,B003X1VJ1M,"First off, the direction. Some of the WORST I've ever seen, the movie continued to annoy from the beginning. There were so many weird angles and ""from behind shots"". Then it started to get MORE annoying, ridiculous camera movements and angles. WHAT was with all this panning and zooming????????? It was like The Hurt Locker but times A FRIGGIN THOUSAND. Worst of all was the sex scene in the meadow, I actually LAUGHED OUT LOUD in the theatre.

Add to that the bad score. So overdone and so cheesy. When the score wasn't unintentionally hilarious, it's ANNOYING. It's like the composer has no idea how to pay attention to detail.

OK that aside. I STILL don't know what the movie's about after I saw it. OK so this guy leaves his textile factory to his son and grandson, Edo... all of a sudden some months later, Edo meets the guy who beat him and is friends with him (and we don't even know how), then they're gay for each other, then they wanna open a restaurant, then they're NOT gay for each other as the grandson's girlfriend's pregnant and the other is banging Edo's mom. Too much plot, not enough STORY- one person in the theatre stated that the film failed to follow the ""Show, don't tell"" route, and I agree completely.

The film only STARTED to make sense towards the end since Edo found out that his mom banged his friend, then the conflict began but about 30 seconds later it was over because he died. The whole death thing just seemed like laziness from the writers just so they could come up with the quickest possible way to end a conflict, and I hated it. And even the ending was predictable too. I'm not kidding, the whole theatre laughed their asses off as it cut to the credits.

The characters aren't cardboard. THEY'RE TISSUE PAPER THIN. Edo, Tilda's character, the chef, the husband... the director wants us to feel for them but we don't care enough for them since they're just archetypes of ones we've seen before. The son was the only connectible character but that was at the end when he realized what's going on, then the connection ended since... well you know. Add to that some hella bad acting, including Tilda (even she sucked... I CAN'T believe I'm saying that since I'm a fan of her!) and the guy who played Edo (I'm not kidding. He was so wooden that his coffin should have been him.

This movie was the biggest argument in ""Style over substance"" I've seen in a while, and I just left the theater totally gypped and robbed of two hours, and I love art cinema.",1281484800,16,2492,4.492273730684326
4214634,3,B003X1VJ1M,"In other words, not my thing. Personal growth within the industrial dynasty, surviving both success and tragedy without losing one's values ... well, I guess that part will appeal to some people.

I'm just there to see Tilda Swinton. According to IMDB, she was nearing 50 when this was filmed - but you'd never know it, except for a delightful bit of mature softness that appears in a steamy scene. (It's a treat that younger women and their partners can look forward to.) Some of the cinematography caught my eye as well, especially the expansive landscapes and minute closeups that become increasingly common as the movie moves on. So, in summary, Swinton is great, some of the imagery will stay with you, but the movie as a whole addresses tastes I don't share.

This was all around well acted but I want to point out the warnings that kept going through my head - even after the movie ended. Never make a lasting decision during a grieving period. They say wait at least 6 months.
Spoiler Alert -
They ended the movie with her desperate declaration of love to another man.  Problem was, he's young enough to be her son and still works for his father. He had just started out on the path of independence because of an opportunity her son - his best friend - gave him. Best case scenario for this relationship is she has a few good years with him before he starts looking for someone his own age. Worst case scenario, he tosses her immediately. It's all fun when it's a clandestine affair but I suspect he doesn't sign up for the long haul.  He feels guilty for his participation in his best friends death. Yes, they both had a hand in it. If the affair hadn't happened he would be alive. If the affair did happen but she didn't force herself on him to explain, he would still be alive. Even if he doesn't see his participation in his friend's death, he is struggling to build a name and business for himself and he's not in a place to take on a long term relationship.

She and her husband both showed love and partnership for each other in what appeared to be a long marriage that had gotten predictable and stale.  She tossed it all in a desperate attempt to make something good out of something bad.  Unfortunately, I think she torched the good (marriage and family) to try to validate the bad choice in having an affair.",1528416000,,1648,4.334415584415584
