3905419,3,B002C8YSBK,"I bought this for my 3 and 5 year old, who love MLP and have seen all of the recent movies.  I have to say I am unhappy with the revamping of this favorite.  This movie does not have the same quality as the rpevious movies!  Along with a new too cutesie look these ponies are also sporting new (and not so great) attitudes.  Instead of the adorable, sweet, caring, and loving friends that we know and love these ponies show jealousy, greed, envy, they fight, stick their tongues out at each other, sneak around to cover up a mistake, and lie.  The redemption and moral that you might expect never really comes as they quickly wrap it up by tossing out a few quick and not heartfelt apologies.  I was hugely upset with this movie and will probably get rid of it as soon as possible.  I'll stick with our favorite loveable ponies!",1260057600,38,828,4.337662337662338
3905420,3,B002C8YSBK,"The My Little Pony franchise is one of the recently resurrected `80s-era toy lines that seek to capitalize on fond memories of parents who grew up with stables full of brightly-colored plastic ponies with wild, multi-colored locks. I am one of those parents. My sisters and I would spend hours parading our ponies through the living room, brushing their hair, and even dressing them up.

When ponies hit the toy market again I was happy to show my daughters the simple joys that they'd brought to my life as a child. It's no great surprise that I was excited to watch My Little Pony - Twinkle Wish Adventure with my daughters to see what animated adventures the next generation ponies were up to. When confronted in-store with the pearly-pink and ever so twinkly box design, parents of girl-children will have a hard time resisting this latest pony release.

Twinkle Wish Adventure finds the ponies preparing for their winter festival where the Wishing Star will wake from it's year long slumber to grant each pony a special wish. However, everything goes wrong when a huge dragon kidnaps the Wishing Star. The ponies are off to recover this vital ingredient for their festivities. In the process of this voyage simple lessons about friendship, reconciliation, and honesty are conveyed.

I was a bit surprised to find that the pony's seasonal festival closely resembles the secular-consumerist holiday of contemporary Christmas celebrations. When I think winter festival my thoughts turn to Quebecois celebrations of snow, ice, and maple syrup - the ponies do go skating and participate in other outdoor activities, but their celebration is centered on mainstream Christmas traditions - baking cookies, making ornaments, and a huge evergreen that they adorn with their handmade contributions and the Wishing Star himself. If like us, you don't celebrate in this way, you'll likely want to pass on this title despite the pony-goodness. If you do go in for light-hearted, secular holiday celebrations - read on for details.

The pony's adventures are punctuated with songs that get my girls up and dancing every time they watch the movie, including the restyled My Little Pony theme song. The animation is bright and fun, filled with flowing multi-colored pony hair and plenty of pink, sparkly moments. Some of the teaching moments are handled too briefly and without much depth - for example, the moment in which an apology for lying is made is incredibly short and there is no real remorse shown in the character.

Shout! Factory goes all-out with the bonus features. Our family's favorite is the six ""Sing-A-Longs""; drawing from the My Little Ponytheme song, four songs from the movie, and a bonus song, the lyrics show along the bottom of the screen and turn pink as they are sung. A short prequel to Twinkle Wish Adventure ""Waiting for the Winter Wishes Festival"" is included along with ""Elefun andFriends"" is a 22-minute vintage-primitive animated cartoon that also focuses on the theme of friendship. The DVD also contains four holiday printables in .pdf format, and access to downloadable pony activities. No scene selection navigation is found on the disc however.

At 81 minutes running time My Little Pony - Twinkle Wish Adventure contains all the pink holiday party fun a little girl could hope for. Something I've discovered is that you can't go back in time - in all honesty I found the film a bit inane - my children love it though. This is one to pop in and head while you tackle some overdue chores, it's not at all appealing to adults (no matter how much we loved My Little Pony as kids), but it's a fun, light-hearted movie for the little ones.",1259280000,8,3661,4.925445705024311
3905421,5,B002C8YSBK,"My Little Pony: Twinkle Wish Adventure is an example of wholesome, family entertainment that teaches children good lessons about friendship.

3905422,5,B002C8YSBK,"I love My Little Pony's. When I was a little girl they were one of my favorite toys to play with. I also really enjoyed the movies and TV show. I'm really glad that they are still going strong and teaching little girls about caring.

In this DVD your little angel can have some fun with Pinkie Pie and all her friends. The Winter Wishes festival is coming up soon and each pony will have one wish granted by the Wishing Star. When the Wishing Star goes missing, it's up to Pinkie Pie to save the day.

3905436,5,B002C8YSBK,"Whatever lady said these ""new ponies"" are mean and stick their tongues out and such...um...yeah welcome to the REAL world. This movie is absolutely perfect for MLP fans. Our 2-year-old daughter loves it! The stars and colors and balloons... they are all true to the old movies but even funner and cuter now. As a millennial, I highly recommend this DVD for younger parents and kids; maybe the older generations can't handle it but it's a perfect gem for little girls.",1395878400,2,467,4.777777777777778

3905440,4,B002C8YSBK,"I first came into MLP with Friendship is Magic. I think something that might have helped some previous reviewers to know is that this has nothing to do with G4 (Friendship is Magic). This is G3, (what My Little Pony was right before Lauren Faust made Friendship is Magic). So take it for granted that this is going to be quite a bit different from what you're used to if you've only seen FiM up until now..

It probably helped me that I'm part of an MLP community that encouraged me to watch cartoons dating all the way back to the original G1 My LIttle Pony. It helped prepare me for the culture shock of a My Little Pony show that wasn't Friendship is Magic.

First thing viewers will notice about this is that it does have a few of the same characters as Friendship is Magic. Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Cherrilee, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle are all characters here. You can even see some resemblences to their Friendship is Magic Counterparts.

Bur personality-wise, they are quite a bit different.

All things said and done, this is a really fun My Little Pony adventure. It's colorful. It's fun. It's perfect for little kids and maybe those who grew up with the previous generations of My Little Pony. It's definetly worth the watch.

Just be prepared (something I'm sure some previous reviewer wish they had known)...this isn't Friendship is Magic. It's a good show in it's own right. But if you go into it expecting FiM, you're bound to be dissapointed.",1379548800,7,1460,4.6

This one is great - it's everything a four year old who loves ponies loves, complete with pink snow! It keeps the story light and refreshing. There's nothing horrible or scary. A great story about friends and caring.",1373760000,2,303,4.333333333333333

3905448,3,B002C8YSBK,"Our (my 4 year old daughter and I) first My Little Pony movie was nothing special at all. I find the Strawberry Shortcake movies to be far superior. Still, my daughter has the pony action figures, so she thought it was neat to see them running around. Medicore all around...animation, voice, music, plot. I don't know if all the pony movies are this bland....but I hope not!",1274659200,,374,4.597014925373134
3905449,5,B002C8YSBK,What I love about this video is the ponies voices are the same as my daughter's other pony video. This dvd is very cute and my son (haha) and daughter love to dance to the music. This video has lots of singing and my kids watch it often!,1264982400,,237,3.9583333333333335
3905450,5,B002C8YSBK,My little one got this for her 3rd birthday and at her party she opened it first and we had to drag her back to the presents she was so excited for Pinkie! Adorable little movie and the animation is really cute too. I usually like the old cartoons more then the new ones like the new care bears I don't so much care for but this little movie is great! I would buy again for sure. If your little one likes my little pony then this is a great little movie to get. Original songs and good lessons about friendship.,1263600000,3,511,4.069306930693069
