7904552,3,B000006BSY,"By and large for film buffs/historians only for these reasons: here are the four Goons together trying to invigorate a mediocre script; Spike Milligan plays 30 seconds or so of tasty jazz trumpet; Carole Carr sings a few songs; the attractive Twelve Toppers are good dancers, if that's you're idea of fun; Sellers does his best to invest some humor in his Colonel Bloodnok character - and provides the few (for me) funny moments in a skit as an American Army colonel and a Jerry Lewis-type lieutenant; Michael Bentine makes his only Goon appearance on film as an absent-minded, on the silly side of funny, professor. Otherwise, Harry Secombe adopts his usual dim-witted persona and Spike Milligan revives his Pvt Eccles character, with an overdone facial expression and voice conveying his version of dim-witted silliness. The plot involves Bentine's Prof PureHeart, an atomic scientist with a formula who, incredibly, only thinks up the formula while in the small town grocery store where Secombe works. He writes it down on the reverse side of a review of a mystery play in which Secombe (who now fancies himself a detective) starred as Bats of the Yard. In his excitement PureHeart runs out of the store without the formula and eventually goes to the local army base, where Secombe is mistakenly inducted, and which the bad guys manage to infiltrate. The rest of the film involves the good guys attempts to find the formula before the bad guys find it.",1444176000,,1455,4.894736842105263
7904553,3,B000006BSY,"There are several things to note about this film that inform my three stars.

For:

There are few enough opportunities to see the Goons team on film. The various players each stay in one character for the whole flick and the plot is simplicity itself and basically is just serving  the purpose of giving an excuse for some slapstick. Secondly the fact that almost anyone who buys this will probably have a rough idea of what they are getting means there is less chance for disappointment. There are some real gems in here though the humour is truly ancient to the point of be hard to follow for some. Bentine does a hilarious sketch of truly inventive prop-driven comedy at one point... really made me chuckle.

Against;

It's only 68 minutes. And that is because the plot is so paper thin it can't sustain anything longer and it was 1952 Britain - its a wonder there was any money to make any sort of film. The comedy is oft-times of such an ancient style it can be trying, my 70 year old father who is an avid Goons fan couldn't make it through it because of this. And one aspect the radio show style Goons comedy is missing and that is very much that on radio you can describe things that are physically impossible and thrown in weird random events or personalities that just can't be done in a more flesh based film.

An historical document to be sure and Goons fans should grab themselves a copy just be aware that you aren't buying a classic.",1398556800,,1448,4.424812030075188
7904554,3,B000006BSY,"There is a phenomenon of many decades' standing in films and television of performers who have achieved fame (i.e., box office) for individual or ensemble brilliance being marketed for the money in inferior vehicles, and this is quintessentially one.
  Brilliant names such as Milligan, Bentine, Sellers, and Secombe are purveyed in a film which promises Goons but works from a script which could have come from a third-tier Hollywood studio writers' committee in the 30's or 40's.
  The best part of this disappointment are the dancers, who, thanks to the miracle of motion image recording, still can excite aesthetic and prurient interest years after they've died of age-related causes. (The digital remastering is indeed masterful.) Dance students should watch those parts of this film.
  Otherwise, only encyclopaedic students of films or the principal cast  need apply themselves to this doubtlessly profitable embarrassment.",1398211200,,930,5.507042253521127
7904555,4,B000006BSY,"I love the Goons and have a number of CDs of their shows, when I discovered there was a movie I just had to get it. It had Goons all over it and had my Mam, brother and I rolling on the floor with laughter... my Dad however didn't find it funny but he isn't much of a Goons fan. If you are a fan of the Goons you want to get this DVD.",1302998400,,334,3.527027027027027
7904556,2,B000006BSY,"DOWN AMONG THE `Z' MEN (1952), also known in some quarters as `The Goon Movie,' stars four members of the popular radio and television series and precursor of Monty Pythons Flying Circus.  Harry Secombe plays Harry Jones, Michael Bentine plays Professor Osrick Purehart, Spike Milligan plays Private Eccles, and Peter Sellers plays Major Bloodnok.

 For all their trail-blazing ways the Goons' first movie is pretty tepid, standard stuff.  Grocery clerk Harry Jones comes into possession of Professor Purehart's top-secret formula.  The clerk and the professor wind up at the same military base, commanded by Major Bloodnok and including among its rank Private Eccles.  The plot, such as it is, concerns a couple of bad spies chasing the formula that the Professor forgot and the clerk doesn't realize he has.  What ensues is a series of loosely connected skits with characters that may have been funny in 7-minute doses but wear out their welcome long before the hour and fifteen minutes are up.  If the Goons' hallmark was surreal zaniness, it's not in evidence here.  Rather you have four Costellos desperately in search of an Abbott, preferably one with a plot in his back pocket.

 Recommended only for those who want to see Sellers in an early movie role or, like me, have heard some classic Spike Milligan bits on tape or radio but have never seen him in action.  With this cast in place it's a little embarrassing to admit that the highlights were a couple of routines performed by an all-girl dance troupe.  At least the price is right.",1126742400,7,1545,4.8961538461538465
7904557,5,B000006BSY,"There's lots of reasons to like this DVD. First, there's the price. Second, there's several lovely moments with Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers. Third, we get to see Spike play a few moments of jazz trumpet. Fourth, we get jazz strumpet -- or rather the next best thing, the lovely dancing Topper Girls. They were excellent. Fifth, did I mention the price? This is really a light variety show, BBC-TV 1950s style. There's a very lose plot that connects events -- but let's not worry about that. The Goons certainly didn't. Michael Bentine is not that funny. But he does try. He certainly tries me. Oh and sixth, it comes in a cardboard sleeve, so the DVD won't take up much space on your shelf. I found the whole thing charming, and I'm happy to have this historical artefact featuring some of two of my favourite comedians.",1120953600,5,825,4.619047619047619
7904558,2,B000006BSY,"Anyone who's heard the Goon Shows knows they were masters of absurdist comedy, and this film sadly contains little of that quality.  The four Goons take on a single character from the Goon Show's plethora of characters for ""Down Among The Z-Men"".
The plot is pretty meager, concerning two thieves who want to steal an atomic formula from Michael Bentine.  Harry Secombe plays a store clerk who accidentally winds up in the army, where Spike Milligan plays numbskull Private Eccles and Peter Sellars is General Bloodnok.
The films tries hard to be entertaining with goofy routines, musical numbers, etc, but is pretty understocked with laughs.  It's certainly not the fault of the Goons, but of the dumb story they were cast in.  Yet I still enjoy the film as a typical bit of early-fifties fluff and others might who are hard-core Goon fans, if only as a novelty.
The cover box picture of Peter Sellars is not from the film, but the way...",972777600,8,939,4.742331288343558
