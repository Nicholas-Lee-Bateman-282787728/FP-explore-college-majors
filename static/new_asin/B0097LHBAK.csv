8537471,5,B0097LHBAK,"I have the complete set of KettleWorx DVDS and although all of them have helped make a significant difference, this one is my favorite! Like the others, it is quick and easy. I can see and feel my abs getting stronger, tighter, and more toned. I purchased this one DVD for my mom to use. She was convinced after seeing my shape and watching me do the work out that it could help her. I use a 15# kb, but my mother has decided to start with a 5# kb. I started with a 10# about a year ago and worked up to a 15# about 6 months ago. As I am getting stronger I can tell I'm need to move up another few lbs on the kb soon.",1366156800,4,617,3.7906976744186047
