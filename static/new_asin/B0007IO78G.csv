2213922,3,B0007IO78G,"Me Gusto Mucho el Dvd, esta bien editado y contiene Lo Mejor de la Telenovela.
Con esta Edicion paso lo mismo que con Abrazame muy Fuerte, en la Portada dice que contiene mas de 300 Minutos y en verdad dura menos, en este caso son 280 Minutos de Resumenes de El Manantial, como dice en la parte trasera (no delantera), y en Abrazame muy Fuerte eran 267 Minutos (no 300).
En sintesis le faltan muchas escenas buenas, pero el Resumen no esta mal, aunque hubiese preferido que dejaran algunas mas, que varias personas como yo recordamos y valoramos mucho.
Por otra parte si me molesto que no dejaran el tema original de la Novela, el de Luis Miguel, Amor amor amor, ya que tiene otra cancion que la canta una mujer y la verdad no me gusta mucho, otra cosa a destacar es la musica incidental no es igual que la original, pero no esta mal despues de todo, es buena dentro de lo que cabe.",1287705600,2,882,4.319277108433735
2213923,5,B0007IO78G,This is one of the best telenovelas I have ever seen and I am also a very big Fan of Adela Noriega. This story is so sad and beautiful that I can only say I love this telenovela !,1286323200,,179,3.6153846153846154
2213924,2,B0007IO78G,The full version was better the story and the trama is good byt the dvd version is too short is not worth your money and time to watch it it is just 4 hour long and edited terribly.  would not recomend to buy it.,1265587200,,212,3.8181818181818183
2213925,4,B0007IO78G,We really enjoyed this novela and didn't want it to end so soon.  Some parts jump a bit because parts have been cut out but it did not really ruin it.,1254787200,,150,3.838709677419355
2213926,5,B0007IO78G,"when this soap opera came out it was well recieved by the viewers on the tv. it is even more so now that it is on dvd. i only happened to catch half of the soap when it came out, so when it was made in dvd format i could not wait to see it from the beginning, it was wonderful.my only regret is,it is cut up in pieces. it is not the whole soap, and i understand, because it is very long and there are great details. it is mainly focused on the the couple in general.which is fine, because the story is still kept in tact, but the characters that are involved, are kind of left a little lost, but i still enjoy this soap, it is a great love story and the drama is not too overwhelming like other soaps, adela noriega and mauricio islas have great chemistry. daniela romo as the vengeful mother is great.",1213488000,,802,4.050314465408805
2213927,3,B0007IO78G,"La historia de la novela es muy buena pero la ediccion muy mala no se porque porque edditan las novelas hasta el punto que uno pierde el trayecto de la historia, en realidad esta muy corta.",1156982400,7,189,4.277777777777778
2213928,5,B0007IO78G,"I had not seen a telenovela since 1997..and honestly the only reason why I bought this DVD was for one reason...the incomparable and talented DANIELA ROMO played Doa Margarita Ramirez, the bitter and evil woman in ""El Manantial"".

  The story follows 2 rivaling families who continually bicker about the piece of land they own. As both their children grow up and eventually fall in love a'la ""Romeo and Juliet""..they soon discover that their love can't be, as gradually hidden drama surfaces. Lots of suspense and never a dull moment on this soap opera. Adela Noriega plays, yet again, a sweet girl who is tormented by another individual and suffers. I guess we can't expect anything else from Adela, as she's been playing the same character for years. Mauricio Islas was not very convincing as the hunk male lead, but luckily the story rarely revolves around him.

  The storyline that stole the novela, in my opinion, are that of the Ramirez (Mauricio's character's parents) estate. Justo Ramirez (Alejandro Tomassi) and Margarita Ramirez (Daniela Romo) own a big estate in their town and possess alot of control over it. Justo's incredibly cold and heartless to everyone, including his own wife, who for unknown reasons secretly hates him, and as the story unfolds we'll realize why. Margarita's character, played AMAZINGLY WELL by Daniela Romo, is the most layered of all characters. She's calculating but at the same time compassionate. She knows how to get what she wants but at the same time still feels for Adela's character, whom her son is in love with. Towards the end of the movie, Margarita suddenly shifts from villain to heroine.

  I have read complainnts about this DVD being too short. I for one can guarantee that I never felt that it was short. If anything, it's a good thing that this DVD has been edited to only 7 hours, as they have cut out all the filler scene. Anyone who has seen telenovelas can tell you this, they prolonge story lines and dialogue to stretch out the telenovela's run and to have more room for advertisments. That's the nature of the business and I am glad that this DVD has NO FILLER, ALL KILLER scenes. You shan't be discouraged. And yes, they have taken out the Luis Miguel theme song ""Amor Amor Amor"" as they didn't get permission from WEA Mexico. It's OK, we can do without it.

  Buy this DVD, you won't regret it. I found it hard to stop watching after a while. I hope they release more entertaining and trashy soap operas with consequential drama like ""El Manantial"". BRING ON ""CUNA DE LOBOS""!",1129507200,19,2545,4.759090909090909
2213929,3,B0007IO78G,The DVD was too short. It didn't contain the original soundtracks from the original novela. The sound was horrible.,1113955200,4,115,5.105263157894737
2213930,4,B0007IO78G,Having never seen the TV version I found this novela to be entertaining.  It's a nice companion to the Amor Real dvd because of the main actors Adela Noriega and Mauricio Islas. They are cute together as a pair in Manantial. Not exactly passionate but very sweet have patience with it- the ending is good. Yes the dvd is rushed but you get all the important stuff.  I recommend it to any novela fans.,1112572800,4,400,4.391891891891892
2213931,5,B0007IO78G,"This was one of the really good novelas shown on TV.  The producer, Carla Estrada, is known for her great productions, including her more recent 'Amor Real' (the very best!).  I recommend this DVD.  I just wish it were longer.  I'd be willing to pay more for, say, a set of 3 or 4 DVD's to get more of the story.",1111708800,7,312,4.065573770491803

8047655,2,B0007IO78G,"I usually like anything with Adela Noriega in it, so I was excited to purchase this.  I'm sure if I had watched this on television every night, I would have liked it more than watching the DVD of it.  It was too short, and whoever edited it did a bad job because it was so choppy. Character introductions weren't made, and I ended up thinking to myself ""Who's that person?"". It will be obvious to the viewer that a lot of the story is missing.  Also, there are no subtitles on this, so it does not help someone who is trying to learn Spanish, like me.",1344556800,,551,4.179245283018868
