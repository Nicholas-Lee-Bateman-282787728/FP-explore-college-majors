8470708,5,B005FUT94S,"This performance is sufficient proof --if need be-- that an intelligent and imaginative stage director can infuse greatness in a theatrical work a century and a half after its debut. Christof Loy's Amsterdam staging of Vpres siciliennes raises the stature of this opera in the Verdian corpus to a height that --having viewed other less innovative versions-- was wholly unexpected for me. His achievement owes a lot, of course, to the orchestra and chorus splendidly conducted by Carignano and, above all, to the acting, especially by Barbara Haveman (Hlne) and Burkhardt Fritz (Henri), but also by the dancers who impersonate young Frdric, Hlne and Henri in the ballet intermezzo.",1408665600,2,680,5.247706422018348
8470709,5,B005FUT94S,"Unless you are allergic to modern interpretations, this 2010 Netherlands Opera production makes an excellent case for probably Verdi's most underrated opera. He wrote Les Vepres Siciliennes after Rigoletto, Trovatore and Traviata, and it strains credulity his inspiration fell off so much after those starry works. Here he had a fine libretto by the well-known poet Scribe that offers both insightful private interactions involving fate, dedication and personal versus private good, plus a moving political overview of an actual 13th century French occupation of Sicily. Musically and dramatically, this is for the most part a strong work, with anticipations of Don Carlo and other later Verdi. It has been criticized as lacking melodic richness, and according to the New Penguin Opera Guide, for its ""self-conscious and contrived artifice."" When it is well done, as it largely is here, I don't see any of that; it's pleasure to see, a stirring piece with strong emotional interactions and fine melody.

Christof Loy's updating to the 1940s doesn't bother me, especially when he focuses so successfully on the interactions of the protagonists and secures such compelling acting. It's true this is a spare staging, but thankfully without extraneous symbols or unwanted goings on, with one exception (more on that later). Updating the story likely has no problem for a modern audience: uprisings are uprisings. So the clothes and props are different than in more traditional productions. Tuxedos, sports jackets and jeans here don't make or break a performance. It's how the characters and their interactions are portrayed which convinces or not. Loy's staging is largely unobtrusive and insightful. He doesn't get in the way of his characters. His conception of the drama is very real - except for the ballet Verdi put in to please the Paris Opera audience for whom this was written.

The opera is sung in French, with its idiosyncratic sound world fitting the music very well. The two protagonists are extremely well sung and portrayed. German tenor Burkhard Fritz's Henri, the main character - like his lead in the Salzburg DVD of Benvenuto Cellini - shows a lyrical gift, a ringing upper range and a real affinity for the French repertoire. Dutch soprano Barbara Haveman displays strong dramatic insight for Helene, the Sicilian heroine, with a sure vocal technique and a powerful upper range. Their fate-driven interactions in acts three and four are most moving, as is the powerful father-son duet (with Fritz and Alejandro Marco-Buhrmester) in act two, echoing Verdi's outstanding father-daughter duets in Rigoletto and Traviata (father and near daughter-in-law) and preceding that in Simon Boccanegra. This is eloquent singing and acting.

The French tyrant Montfort is well sung by a suavely sinister, light-voiced Marco-Buhrmester, although he could show more of a harsh side; his relative gentleness, however, does seem more in line with the love he shows for his son. Balint Szabo's Sicilian rebel Procida is movingly sung and displays an inner fire which is compelling. Paolo Carignani leads the fine Netherlands Philharmonic with flair and drama, making the most of this score.

The one problem I find here is the ballet between acts three and four. Loy and choreographer Thomas Wilhelm portray Henri imagining what married life would be with his beloved Helene. Unfortunately, here are 22 minutes of largely puerile narcissism and some insensitive indulgences that are hard to watch and eminently forgettable - with music that is not top drawer Verdi. Children bouncing around the stage, sexual bizarreness and pasta being tossed on plates are not something I want to see again. In 1856, soon after Les Vepres was written, Verdi authorized permission for the ballet to be removed from Italian theaters - being beyond the resources of most of their houses, according to the  Penguin Guide. I have no problem simply skipping the ballet here. The drama is stronger without it.

Some will also object to Loy's temerity of moving the overture - amazingly placing it some 20 minutes into the opera. He begins the overture focused on Montfort in telling gestures, then offers a lineup of real-time faces of Sicilians, occasionally highlighting one after another, even having them gradually transform into children before gradually becoming adults again. The opera thus starts with action and offers a moving display of white-heat revolutionary zeal during the overture. I found not only did it not upset the work's dramatic continuity but was quite moving.

Loy gets the vibrant and strong-voiced Chorus of the Netherlands Opera to act quite often as individuals and not as the traditional big, boring uniform monolith - as Dmitri Tcherniakov has, too in some of his opera efforts. This brings more personality, realism and conviction to the performance.

Overall, strongly recommended, in spite of the ballet.",1375747200,2,4916,5.245547073791348
8470710,4,B005FUT94S,"I have loved this opera for years, but I only knew it in the Italian translation.
I have the two DVDs available and I've seen them a couple of times, the studio recording of it with Domingo, Arroyo and Milnes, I have played it so often that I can not count the times.
But I have heard it only once in its original French, that was at the Sarasota Opera in the mid 1990s, unfortunately that was not a good performance, the soprano lacked the required stamina to get through such a long evening, and the results were less than mixed. By the time she got to the Bolero she sounded exhausted.
So, when I saw that this Blu-ray was available, I ordered it on the spot, and I am not sorry.
The voices, the orchestra, the chorus, a great musical experience.
I will ""hear"" this Blu-ray many times more, I truly loved the audio part of it.
The entire score was great, by the finale I was all goose pimples, what an exciting performance.
The placement of the overture, although strange, did not bother me and I loved the ballet music, some people object to it, but it is beautiful music.
So, if you love Verdi, this is a recording to treasure.
But, in regard to the staging, it was really bizarre and at times really strange, but for that part I will refer you to the previous reviewer, Todd Kay, he said practically everything that I was going to.",1346544000,3,1337,4.330677290836653
8470711,4,B005FUT94S,"In the behind-the-scenes featurette on the BD for this opera, Frank, one of the nearly 100 strong chorus of the Nederlandse Opera, says that he feels like he is not just one of the crowd in this production, he's part of history. And in a way, there is definitely something momentous about Verdi's Les Vpres Siciliennes (1855). It's not just the fact that it's Verdi in full-blown Grand Opra mode, in French moreover, or that it's based around an historical event that has contemporary and political significance for the revolutionary-minded composer himself - but it's also a lesser-known Verdi opera, very rarely performed or recorded, even more rarely in its full French version complete with a half-hour ballet in the middle. The Dutch production of Les Vpres Siciliennes in Amsterdam is certainly an historic occasion then, and what a fascinating, thrilling and momentous event it turns out to be.

Christof Loy's direction is by no means the fiasco that has been suggested elsewhere. The director's touches are distinctive certainly, and not for everyone, but taking the opera out of its natural time period (1282) - which would have no meaning or significance for a modern audience anyway and arouse none of the contemporary revolutionary passions Verdi undoubtedly was aiming for - Loy manages nonetheless not only to do great service to the opera but even help cover over some of its flaws. The sets are kept minimal, with rarely anything more than a few chairs scattered around the stage, creating a sense of timelessness that is reflected in the modern costumes. Props and effects are rarely used, but when they are they are employed for maximum impact. Where the plot and the libretto are less convincing, Verdi's music fills in the gaps and Loy steps back and lets it speak for itself (the otherwise static Act IV for example is powerful simply through a magnificent set of duets, a trio and a quartet). In the places where even Verdi's judgement of the occasion is questionable - the start of Act V for example - Loy steps in and manages to make something more meaningful out of it.

The director chooses the Four Seasons ballet in Act III to be the thematic centrepoint of his interpretation (controversially it would seem), giving motivation to Henri's later actions that are otherwise difficult to reconcile, the revelations about his own origins and his father leading him to idealise or just imagine how things might have been different. This illusory ideal leads him to believe that his marriage to Hlne at the start of Act V (the same fantasy home setting of the ballet is used here) - otherwise an improbably joyous occasion considering the circumstances - could bring a true peaceful union between France and Sicily. It's a thoughtful interpretation by a director who clearly cares enough to play to the opera's strengths and mitigate its weaknesses. At the very least, it's certainly preferable to simply cutting the ballet, as would be more common (if the opera were indeed more commonly performed), and letting it limp by with its inherent flaws.

Although there are some unfamiliar elements, the opera itself is recognisably and whole-heartedly Verdi, with romantic tragedy, dire threats of revenge and rousing revolutionary sentiments. Musically, Les Vpres Siciliennes doesn't always feel like the Verdi we know, but, like Don Carlo (a much better opera admittedly), there's something fascinating and appropriately dramatic about having the Verdi experience filtered through the French Grand Opra idiom, with its echoes of Un Ballo in Maschera and even Rigoletto and La Traviata here, with its rousing choruses and its grand Overture (placed strangely between Acts I and II here, but no less effectively), but with unexpected delicacy and with musical arrangements that I've never heard from Verdi before, such as in the wonderful ballet music. The orchestra and the chorus, under Paolo Carignani, are outstanding in their delivery, the opera approached with a true Verdian sweep.

The singing - even though there are some difficult passages and coloratura to navigate right at the end of a long opera - is for the most part beyond reproach. Barbera Haveman is a great presence, the charismatic figure that Hlne needs to be, her singing strong and heartfelt throughout. Burkhard Fritz is a lovely lyrical tenor who manages to make the difficult nature of Henri's plight sympathetic. Balint Szabo's bass makes for a grave, dignified, yet compelling revolutionary voice as Procida. Alejandro Mario-Buhrmester is fine, but the weakest of the principals, not really cutting a strong enough figure as Montfort, and his singing isn't as clear and resonant as the others. Les Vpres Siciliennes isn't great Verdi by any means, but it's a side to Verdi that we rarely see in his most popular works, and it's thrilling for that alone. We can be grateful to the Nederlandse Opera for bring the full opera in its full original form (with only one slight tweak of the placement of the Overture), but also to have a director like Christof Loy, who clearly cares enough to put the additional effort into making the opera relevant and meaningful.",1316995200,11,5157,5.028070175438597
