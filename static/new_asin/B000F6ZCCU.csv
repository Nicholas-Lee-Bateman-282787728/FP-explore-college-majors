8563208,4,B000F6ZCCU,"Good bio.  The trouble is if you already admire Montgomery Clift, watch his acting, and have read the books about him...you are still very hungary.  I'm from Omaha and driven by his house ...Kevin McCarthy is dead. Everyone who knew him is gone or going.  I hate that. Liz won't talk.",1293840000,,284,4.529411764705882
8563209,4,B000F6ZCCU,"Well, I have just bought this DVD and I am quite happy with it. The fact is that there is not much stuff available about Montgomery Clift nowadays. Therefore, having the possibility of viewing and listening to his friends and family is really thrilling for me. I had previously seen another documentary on this actor and I have to admit that this one by Biography Channel is somehow more factual and less intimate. There are fewer details about personal experiences and anecdotes (maybe because it is more recent). Despite, this DVD contains various interesting features: pictures that I had not seen before, some voice records of telephone talks, etc. In short, I definetely recommend this product to any person interested in knowing about this great actor.",1209427200,2,758,5.023809523809524
8563210,4,B000F6ZCCU,"As the title of this documentary suggests, Montgomery Clift is today looked upon as a somewhat ""hidden"" star, but in his heyday he was among the most celebrated of male actors in Hollywood. In the early 1950s, probably the only male actor who could compete with Clift in terms of popularity was Marlon Brando, and actually, most role offers came to Monty first (some examples being SUNSET BLVD., ON THE WATERFRONT and MOBY DICK) but he turned most of them down, being almost peculiarly selective by Hollywood-standards.

This documentary, being part of the well-known A&E BIOGRAPHY-series, is as far as I can see the second documentary made on this incredibly talented though troubled actor, and it turns out to serve well as an over-view on his life. In roughly 50 minutes, it covers all of the major events, from his birth in 1920, providing some interesting archive footage and recordings in the process. One recording includes a conversation between Monty's brother Brooks and their mother Sunny; another has a telephone call Monty had with one of his friends in the early 1960s, where he expresses how great it would be if he won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Sigmund Freud (this makes for rather sad listening). Granted, I'm a bit of a skeptic when conversations such as the latter are revealed to the public; could Monty have anticipated that the tape was going to be used in a documentary decades later? Probably not. Still, the conversation does feel relevant in its given context here. Also included are many interviews with friends and relatives of Monty, and of course Clift's biographer Patricia Bosworth.

Being a very complex man who had been practically isolated from the world during much of his childhood (his mother didn't allow her children to go to ordinary schools or play with other kids), Monty eventually developed problems with alcohol and drugs as an adult. The situation turned worse after a serious car accident in 1956; he survived miraculously, but his face was badly damaged, and while surgeons managed to do an impressive job under the circumstances, naturally he didn't look the same thereafter. The movies became fewer and fewer. He died in 1966, not yet 46 years of age.

I recommend this documentary to fans of Clift, as well as people curious about him. I wouldn't have minded if it were a bit longer, but I understand A&E has a schedule to follow. It tends to get a bit overly concerned with the scandals and disappointments in Clift's life, perhaps; this is rather typical of documentaries on Hollywood-stars, of course. Still, it makes for a decent way to spend 50 minutes. The DVD is a so-called DVD-R, without any main menu or subtitles.",1158624000,11,2688,4.864628820960698
