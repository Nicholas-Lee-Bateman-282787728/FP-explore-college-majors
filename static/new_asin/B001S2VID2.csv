8521812,2,B001S2VID2,I was expecting a little more from this DVD. Dayle Doroshow is a talented artist but she only shares one recipe (for Jade) and one project. I have seen other videos and usually the polymer clay artist teaches different techniques and tips. Spending more than one hour doing only one project wasn't fun.,1364860800,,302,4.716981132075472
