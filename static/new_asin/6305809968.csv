1075444,5,6305809968,"As a fan of schlocky, ""so bad they're good"" films, I have seen quite a few that simply amaze with their ineptness, from classics such as  ""Plan 9"" and ""Robot Monster"" to more recent howlers  such as ""Lake Placid"". However, nothing - and I mean nothing -  could have prepared me fully for the experience of finally seeing  ""Mighty Peking Man"". This film is an absolute camp-trash  GOLDMINE; a cinematic abomination so astonishingly bad that it defies  rational explanation. It literally must be seen to be believed!  This is  not a criticism, however; but rather an endorsement: ""Mighty Peking  Man"" is punishingly hilarious; an unintentional laugh-riot of lame  acting, atrocious dubbing, and inarguably the worst - the WORST - optical  effects I have ever witnessed in a professional (and that's stretching the  word to its outer limits) motion picture. The movie goes so far over the  top that it borders on the psychedelic; indeed, copious amounts of  mind-altering substances are probably required to get the full ""Peking  Man"" experience. The film's grade-Z pleasures are too numerous to  list, but would certainly start with Peking Man himself: a moth-eaten,  googly-eyed, rubber-mouthed gorilla suit, from all appearances rented from  a local costume shop and about as convincing. Then there's Evelyne Kraft,  the ""heroine"", who, despite living in the wild jungle for 20  years, sports a perfect 1970's-era Farrah Fawcett layered hairdo, mascara,  and a seemingly endless supply of lip gloss. Throw in a romance between  Kraft and ""Johnny"", the hero (complete with a wretchedly awful -  and brutally funny - slow motion ""running through the fields""  sequence as they ""fall in love"", while all the while the  out-of-tune orchestra warbles on) and the oblogitory final battle between  Peking Man and woefully obvious model helicopters (the strings supporting  them fully visible) and you have the stuff of which cult midnight-movie  dreams are made. Kudos to Quentin Tarantino for resurrecting this trashy  gem, in widescreen no less! For those of you out there who relish  so-unbelievably-bad-they're-cool films, put ""Showgirls"" on hold  and give this one a go; you won't regret it. Now, Quentin, how about a  reissue of ""KISS meets the Phantom of the Park""?",966211200,15,2264,5.185595567867036

Add this to your collection. It may only  have the depth of a moonbeam; but this is what to watch when Bergman,  Kubrick or even Polanski can't satisfy the evening.",963878400,5,338,4.677966101694915
1075446,4,6305809968,"Finally, a ""Bad"" movie that lives up to all it's hype!  This is one absolutely hysterical trash epic that every cult movie fan needs to see.  From the opening moments to the ridiculous finale, there are tons  of laughs to be had in this Hong Kong ""King Kong"" rip-off --- the  effects are atrocious, the melodrama is way over the top, the dialog is  hilarious,  the acting is terrible --- and it all comes together into one  great package of stupidity!  This is one truly godawful piece of junk that  delivers the goods.  Originally released in the 70's as  ""Goliathon"", ""Mighty Peking Man"" is a true treasure  trove of dumbness.  Thank you Tarantino for resurrecting it!  The DVD  looks great --- the film is in panavison and includes the trailer (for the  recent re-issue only).  If you enjoy bad movies, this one is a hoot!

1075560,3,6305809968,"Another Quentin Tarantino resurrection, ""Mighty Peking Man"" (1977) is pure, unapologetic schlock delivered in grand Hong Kong style. The Shaw Brothers gleefully ripoff Dino De Laurentiis' 1976 remake of ""King Kong"" and throw in a little ""Sheena, Queen of the Jungle"" for good measure. No martial arts, but plenty of monster-stomping and cheesy romance  considerably more than the big-budget De Laurentiis production.

1075561,4,6305809968,"The Peking Man lives in India and is an ape, not a man. Johnnie Fang (Danny Lee) is sent after the creature and he encounters the proverbial jungle woman (Evelyn Craft) whose parents were killed in a plane crash. (Plane and skeletons are nearby.) She was raised by Peking Man and has become the ""Ellie Mae"" of the jungle.

I loved the contrast of the stage set with the background scenery. Clearly this was done as a tribute to those old Tarzan films were they would weave stock footage into the film. There is also an Ed Wood influence.

Evelyn Craft runs around as if she is on frame or move from popping out of her top.

Very high camp value. Great with the funny stuff.

There is one quick nude scene, however in this version the extended nudity has been cut out. Nudity in trailers.",1386633600,4,787,4.36986301369863
1075562,5,6305809968,"This film is easily one of my favorite giant ape movies of all time because its camp but played serious. If you like early Godzilla movies, you will probably like this. Fantastic, scale-model city sets and a not-so-great looking ape costume are the main features. Mix in a scantily-clad, blonde, jungle-woman and some common 70's exploitation themes; how could you go wrong. There is much more destruction in this flick than any other giant ape movie ever made. Peking Man's rampage through city streets is on par with early TOHO movies, as he destroys buildings, army vehicles, cars and people, and eventually catches on fire (yes you read it right, catches on fire!). Campy, destructive, and entertaining, what more could you ask for? The melodramatic falling in love scenes between Samantha and Johnny have to make you laugh. When they get caught in bed together, in a cave, the giant Peking Man gets jealous! Priceless!!",1326067200,,924,4.967741935483871
1075563,2,6305809968,"I'll start by saying that I am generally fond of giant ape camp classics (like ""A*P*E"") but found ""Mighty Peking Man"" grating, long, boring, and unfunny. In short, it really tried my patience. I generously gave it two stars for the presence of Evelyne Kraft as the comical blonde jungle nymph who was raised by Mighty Peking Man, and especially the truly bizarre tiger and cheetah encounters (who knew a live cheetah makes such a great stole?)

Apparently Quentin Tarantino likes this movie, as it was released on DVD by Rolling Thunder Pictures under one of its many monikers, ""Mighty Peking Man,"" though I think the original Shaw Brothers title ""Xing Xing Wang"" is much more entertaining. The film starts right off with an adventurer, Johnnie, discovering his girlfriend having an affair, so on a whim he takes an assignment to go to India to find a giant monkey, Mighty Peking Man. I have to tell you that this film had probably the worst process shots of animals I have ever seen. I especially loved the elephant stampede, though the big cats were great too. Mighty Peking Man himself is a guy is an absolutely terrible ape suit. In the first few minutes of the film the expedition to capture the monkey encounters an earthquake, a tiger attack (note: the way to escape a tiger attack is not to jump in quicksand as it turns out,) an elephant stampede, and a nasty fall from a scary cliff. Johnnie also finds Samantha, the blonde jungle queen, and it's love at first sight. Of course she was raised after surviving a plane crash as a girl by Mighty Peking Man, and they communicate on a deep level and he obeys her commands. Johnnie saves Samantha from a nasty cobra bite with the help of some medicinal leaves Mighty Peking Man brings, cementing their relationship. Please especially enjoy the ""frolicking in the jungle"" scene while some of the worst 1970's music in existence swells on the soundtrack. Both your eyes and ears will scream for mercy.

Of course Johnnie is still under contract to capture the ape, so even though he has reservations he persuades Samantha to accompany them to Hong Kong where he will be put on display. The lash him to the deck of a boat, sail through a typhoon (don't worry when the ship hits a rock in the middle of the ocean, that's just fine,) set up shop in a stadium, and proceed to mistreat the ape. I was amused that Johnnie bought Samantha a dress to replace her fur loincloth and bikini top. He chose an ultra-comfy form-fitting black latex outfit, which Samantha promptly threw out a porthole. Up to this point the movie was modestly entertaining from a camp perspective, but about halfway through it, I started to lose patience.

The big change involves the mistreatment of Mighty Peking Man, and the unbelievably overblown drama that went along with his escape and battle for existence. There's an unsavory assault complete with wine on bodice (""just like the jungle,"") and lots of scenery chewing from both Samantha and the forces allied to kill the ape, though the justice was entertaining when the kidnapper got pulled from a building, flung to the ground and stomped with a very hilarious foot. There's lots of military hardware shooting at Mighty Peking Man, a double-crossing military officer, and of course the final stand atop Hong Kong's tallest building. (I wonder if the filmmakers had ever seen any earlier giant ape movies.... Sigh.) There is much drama (the plot to blow up the building with hardware apparently from a dime store is particularly painful) and much shooting, resulting ultimately in Mighty Peking Man toppling on fire to his death below, where a similar fate awaits Samantha. The film closes full of pathos with Johnnie holding Samantha in the burning building, much to the relief of the audience.

The DVD also features a preview of the film and a couple of other previews too, but no appreciable extras. The first half has the making of a camp classic, but the last half is so overwrought and heavy-handed that it fails as camp, making the film just an uncomfortable melange with occasionally amusing action. Do yourself a favor and just watch the trailer and feel free to discard the DVD. You aren't missing much, and it's 90 minutes of your life you can do something better with.",1276646400,6,4261,4.738544474393531
1075564,4,6305809968,"I find the high-budget King Kong versions lack the ""charm"" or ""love"" of this D-grade counterpart, which is why I won't even own Peter Jackson's visual overkill (has no heart).  To appreciate this one, you need to have a grasp of the heightened sense of drama, a caricature of its other lavish counterparts.  Makes no sense that our hero Johnnie gets his heart broken when he catches his brother sleeping with his fiancee and then flies to India on a whim to find the Mighty Peking Man. Just like that.  Like an extreme soap opera. But if you go with it, it makes a lot of sense.  It's like the filmmakers are saying, ""This is what comprises a hit movie.""  So with that formula, they also have the gorgeous Evelyn Kraft as Samantha the jungle girl.  Apparently, in modern American pop culture, ANY blonde woman is considered beautiful, which is utter nonsense.  Which is why it's rare to have this gorgeous blonde represent beauty.  Major gripe for me though is that in the Hong Kong trailer (found on Youtube), there is nudity, but this Quentin Tarantino version is trimmed of it, down to a PG-13.  Why didn't Quint just release it unrated, makes it more ""underground""?  Anyway, would have appreciated Evelyn Kraft's delights, but the movie's pretty fun either way.",1224720000,3,1265,4.709090909090909
1075565,5,6305809968,"this junk was sooooo poorly made that it's become one of the greatest comedies ever. scenes are reapeated, obvious minitures were used, scences were done in reverse. im tired of typing now.",1186099200,,189,4.9375
1075566,3,6305809968,"This is a really goofy giant ape movie, and after watching both A*P*E and the Mighty Gorga I was well prpared to pull this one to bits as well, but I have to say that although it's not a particularly good film, it does at least have a lot more going for it that those two pitiful efforts. ""Mighty Peking Man"" barely wanders from the well worn path that most King Kong imitators follow. Suffice to say that a giant ape-man awakens during an earthquake and breifly terrorizes a jungle village before getting hunted and captured by mean and greedy big city people. After being put on display and humiliated, the ape-man escapes and runs amok, causing much destruction before climbing a tall building and is being finally shot down by the armed forces. You have to admire the gall of the makers of this film, they couldn't have slavishly copied the plot of the original much more closely than this!

I'm kind of torn between laughing at this film and actually enjoying it on it's own merits at the same time. So I'll give you my summary of how it works on both levels. First off, as a ""so bad it's good"" movie, the film scores highly. The film uses A LOT of miniature model sets in the scenes of Peking Man (this is how he is referred to in the movie) rampaging about, and these are nearly always pretty awful. The model village that gets destroyed by earthquake right at the start is dire, it really does look like a load of 6-inch high toy huts that someone is throwing handfuls of dirt over. The shockingly poor rear projection special effects don't help much, either. As for Peking Man himself, well at least the monkey costume is a lot better than the ones in A*P*E (that one didn't even fit properly) and ""The Mighty Gorga"" (worst ever -and they only showed the top half). In this movie, we see lots of shots of giant ape hands grabbing the cast, and they look quite good, as do his big monkey feet when he stomps on people. There appears to be a model prop head used for extreme close ups of Peking Man snarling or otherwise emoting, and this looks kind of...monsterish. Shame it doesn't really match the costumed actor's gorilla mask, but I quite liked it. OK, next off, the acting is generally pretty poor, plus the English dubbing is appalling. In fact the soundtrack in general is quite bad, most noticably in the noises that Peking Man himself makes - his roar sounds like a woman's scream mixed in with various bird noises and a cement mixer!

So as a spectacular monster show, the film falls a bit flat, due to all the bad special effects. But here's what goes some way to make up for this - the film has definitely got gusto - all the onscreen mayhem is churned out almost non-stop, and it hardly ever lets up. As long as Peking Man is onscreen, there's always something being destroyed or exploding, and although the effects are poor, there are loads and loads of them, so it's hard to complain of boredom, which is one thing that stops most bad films in their tracks. Secondly, the film really does have a heart. Peking Man's love interest in this story is a beautiful blonde girl who has grown up in the jungle after being the sole survivor of a plane crash as a child. He is very attached to her, and actually allows himself to be taken from the jungle and put on display on her request (she has fallen in love with the hunter who came in search of the monster). Now the actress playing Samantha the jungle girl is not great, but she makes an appealing alternative to the usual city dame heroine type, because she starts the film as the ape-man's friend, with his well-being already on her agenda. And even Peking Man himself has character, with the monkey-suit actor actually managing to portray some semblance of emotion without looking totally daft, and the scenes between him and Samantha can be quite sweet, even if the pathos is laid on with a trowel.

The trouble is that so much of the film is such baloney that any good aspects get swamped. There's too much time spent on rubbish special effects and miniature sets which are always totally deserted, or scenes with Samantha running around Hong Kong in her fur bikini and bare feet without attracting the slightest interest, or the awful ""love scenes"" of Johnny the hunter and his ex - in fact that entire sub-plot is terrible. The list goes on, and these things just disable the film's otherwise commendable efforts at being a good piece of entertainment. Still at least this is one ""bad"" movie you can watch for laughs and still come away from NOT feeling that you have just totally wasted 90 minutes of your life. I thought it was a lot of fun.",1170028800,,4620,4.471563981042654
1075647,2,6305809968,"I watched this movie on IFC or the Sundance Channel because I wondered why this movie would be on those channels.  I guess Quentin Tarantino is a fan or there's a DVD of this movie with ""Quentin Tarantino Presents"" on it or something.

What does QT see in this?  I don't know.

This is a terrible movie.  Think of the worst American monster movie made in color on a $1.98 budget and then make it five times worse.  Ed Wood would've turned this project down.  I grew up loving Godzilla movies and I still didn't like this.

The only thing this movie has going for it is the stunningly-hot blonde running around in a skimpy outfit she can't keep on straight.  The only drama, the only tension, the only interest I could maintain in this lame movie was what was going to pop out next on the native girl.

But is this so bad that it's good?  I didn't think so.  It's definitely not in the big leagues with GODZILLA VS. THE SMOG MONSTER (the Big G fights a giant booger to the death) or the original HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP (mutated salmon chases human women for some strange).

Maybe the folks at ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" could pull a classic episode out of this.",1153699200,2,1165,4.362790697674418
1075648,3,6305809968,"If you are reviewing this film with a critical mind you are wasting your time and that of your reader. ""The Mighty Peking Man"" is pure Daikaiju (Giant Monster) fun from start to finish. If you see a ""man in a suit"" as many do, that's another obvious reason to avoid this film. Of course it's cheap and not as expensive as American films but it has some great moments worth mentioning. Many people tend to lump all Daikaiju films together because they don't get the concept so I can't read those reviews either. These are the same people that see Animae as being cartoons. Need I say more. Gamera & Godzilla are not in the same category as this film....next lesson.

You know the plot from ALL of the other reviews. Giant Ape and jungle girl meet with disaster in modern civilization. Twenty minutes into this film and you can see why The Shaw Brothers were brilliant Grindhouse film makers. It's no wonder Tarantino's Rolling Thunder Pictures got it released. Many reviewers fail to see the connection between modern day cinematic homages to low budget films like this one. There was a style of producing/editing despite the obvious cheapness that makes this a pleasure to view.

Dramatic orchestra scores and funky soulful disco ballads collide with some nice sets and priceless dialog that you will not find in modern movies. I don't care what the Shaw Brothers intended, it's brilliant parody and fun to watch.

Don't be critical and miss the point. Compare this to APE being sold alongside this film. APE is SO BAD it's surrealistic. Who knows where the film producers were going with that movie. Call me crazy but this movie is a guilty pleasure and far more fun than most of modern Hollywood's CGI effect films. It's more fun than the seventies American remake of King Kong too.

Buy it, rent it, love it, it is what it is....entertaining and not to be reviewed as a landmark cinema classic, but rather a look back into the day when when we could go with our familys to drive-ins and not 20 unit stadium seating Cineplexes of doom!

1075649,3,6305809968,"after dino de laurentiies scored reasonably well with his remake of king kong in 1976 (still overall box office returns of more than 50 mio. us dollar in north america only) it prompted the shaw brothers to produce a 'chinese' version of the story. what is interesting here is to compare the special effects and the way of acting with the japanese toho produced godzilla movies that we are much more used to. certainly the japanese producer tomuyiki tanaka had a lot more experience in making those films, so in comparison, the mighty peking man does not stand up well. on a passionate view, in the end neither the ape, nor the girl actually make it.

if you do travel to hong kong frequently, you will be amused to see how much this city has changed over the last 3 decades. overall an amusing time killer for 90 minutes.

1075651,5,6305809968,"This is a little exploitation movie aimed squarly at hip people who often ""GET IT"" and not at pseudo intelectuals who like to poke fun at films like this and consider them quaint or ""so bad its funny"". This film is really intended as an homage to adventures like KING KONG , SHEENA and TARZAN. More of a tribute than rip-off, it obvious that alot of care was placed in the making of the film. Its easy to mock the special effects, but before you do, consider the budget constraints. This was not Paramount or Universal, it was Shaw Brothers. If you ""get it"" like I do, you will enjoy Peking Man, If not may i recommend THE CORE, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, INDEPENDENCE DAY or 1998's GODZILLA.

P.S.  There were alternate edits of this film released to theatres in the USA in 1978. They were created through some clever editing on the part of the american distributor, who wanted a more upbeat finale.  In one version the girl lives at the end. In another version its all ambiguous. In another one it looks like the girl makes it but the guy gets shot. In another, Peking man is still alive after his fall.  And in yet another version he never falls at all.

This version is the unedited original as the director intended.

1075652,4,6305809968,"I'm honestly not sure whether to give this film one star because it's so poorly made or five stars just for it's sheer entertainment value. So I'm settling on four.
Here's the story: Hong Kong explorer Johnney is depressed ever since he found his girlfriend in bed with his brother. (If this happened today, they'd go on Jerry Springer.)
He is hired by a rich tycoon to go to a jungle and find a giant ape-god. Johnney goes to the jungle with some aides and soon after arriving they are beset upon by all sorts of perils. I know jungles aren't normally regarded as the safest of places, but this one seems especially dangerous. The extras get killed off left and right, making you wonder if it's the world's deadliest jungle, if these guys lack any kind of explorer training or experience whatsoever, or if exploring a jungle is like going off to war, where casualties are ineveitable. Eventually the survivors try to convince Johnney to give up and go home, but Johnney won't go until he's found what he's looking for. So during the night the others pack up and sneak off while he's asleep, in one of the film's few logical moments.
The next morning Johnney wakes up and finds himself alone. Then, in one of the movie's greatest moments, the title beast manages to sneak up on him and grab him from behind without him noticing! The monster is like 50 ft. tall, it's broad daylight, and Johnney's wide awake, yet somehow he didn't notice the creature was right behind him the whole time!
Later Johnney meets Samantha, a white woman whose plane crashed in the jungle when she was like 5 or 6 and whose parents were killed in the crash. Sam is now a grown woman in a jungle bikini who is friends with Peking Man. Natrually she and Johnney fall in love, and then he convinces her to take Peking Man and go back with him to Hong Kong.
You can probably guess what happens from here. If you happen to already own PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE and THE MIGHTY GORGA, put this one in your video collection alongside those two.",1083715200,3,2014,4.475543478260869
1075653,3,6305809968,"The Mighty Peking Man (1977), aka Colossus of the Congo, aka Goliathon has to be one of the worst Chinese giant ape run amok in the big city films I've ever seen...okay, it's the only one I've ever seen, but still...back in the mid 90's, after great successes at the box office, Quentin Tarantino founded Rolling Thunders Pictures, with the notion of bringing to light rare and independent films that might not have gotten the attention they deserved within the American public, highlighting on exploitation films.  Mighty Peking Man was one of a handful of releases before Rolling Thunder closed shop in 1997.
So what about the movie?  Okay, here it goes...the film starts off in Hong Kong, and shows some Chinese guys talking over a newspaper reporting on a giant footprint found in the Himalayas.  They seem awful excited, as they have dreams of fame, fortune, and pennywhistles dancing in their heads if they could ever capture the creature that made this footprint, and bring it back to Hong Kong.  Cutting to what I am assuming is some sort of flashback, we see a primitive jungle village (okay, a cheesy looking miniature of a primitive jungle village), all peaceful and calm, suddenly torn apart by a violent earthquake.  The quake not only shakes up the villagers and such, but awakens Mighty Peking Man, who happened to be sleeping, or frozen into, a nearby mountainside.  He proceeds to trash the village, and we get to see a whole lot of crummy blue screen work as natives run to and fro, shrieking and getting squashed by flying debris, as they're oft to do...after cutting back to the Chinese men, they decide to mount an expedition to capture the monster, and enlist the aid of Johnny, another Chinese man, one who agrees readily to lead them as he just had a falling out with his girlfriend, told through a tedious and particularly nauseating flashback later in the film, and is willing to risk life and limb just to get out of town.
As the men travel to where they think the Mighty Peking Man might be, they encounter all kinds of jungle dangers, stuck carts in shallow rivers, stampeding herds of elephants (yeah, keep shooting that .38 revolver at them, I am sure that will do the trick), man hungry leopards, quicksand, and precarious cliffs.  Just to give you an idea how `professional' this expedition actually is, the men scale the particularly steep cliff using a grappling hook.  Needless to say, various pack-bearing natives are lost through all these encounters.  After finding some giant footy prints, they decide to follow them, and then set up camp.  During the night, the remaining members decide to leave, all the bad stuff that has happened up until this point has them discouraged, I guess, so they sneak out and leave Johnny, who awakes the next morning to find himself alone.  While wandering around, looking for the rest of his party, he gets scooped up by Mighty Peking Man (Johnny seems painfully disconnected to his surroundings, or Mighty Peking Man is awful stealthy, given that he's like 60 some feet tall) and also meets a blonde jungle girl named Samantha, who seems to have control over Mighty Peking Man, along with many other jungle creatures.  The Johnny and the jungle girl, who is sporting barely there animal skins, develop a relationship, and Johnny convinces her to get Mighty Peking Man to take them to civilization.  This sets up for one of the men, the greedy capitalist and leader of the group who was on the expedition originally, to make Johnny adhere to the deal and Mighty Peking Man is soon chained on the forward deck of a steamship.
On arriving at Hong Kong, Mighty Peking Man is put on display at what appears to be a monster truck rally, and Samantha is beginning to regret her decision about leaving the jungle.  Oh yeah, she continues to run around in her skimpy animal skins.  The evil capitalist exploits Mighty Peking Man in rather cruel fashion, and even attacks the blonde in a lusty manner (yuck) which cause Mighty Peking Man to go insane in the membrane, breaking free of his chains and cage and run amok in Hong Kong, which seems rather scarcely populated...maybe it's the off season.  He smashes empty buildings and stomps on cars filled with jet fuel, based on the explosive reaction after said cars get stomped on...he also squishes a number of fleeing pedestrians, in less than realistic fashion.  This sets up the final climatic fight scene with Mighty Peking Man on top of a tall building, battling helicopters (I know I've seen this somewhere before), and his eventual flaming, crashing, demise (big surprise).  I really loved how the authorities dealt with the creature, and how little regard they had for the surrounding public they were trying to protect.
Yeah, The Mighty Peking Man is an obvious rip-off of King Kong (1933) and Mighty Joe Young (1949), one that lacks even the most basic shred of likeability of those two films.  The monkey suit looks about as good as costumes donned in a Toho Godzilla release.  The dubbing is exceptional bad throughout the film, and the miniatures are all that great, either.  The extra poor treatment of Mighty Peking Man by his captors, beating his feet with bamboo sticks and such, meant to make us feel sorry for him, was so obviously blatant as all it did was illuminated the stupidity of the makers of this film, and their incredibly lame efforts to try and garner emotion from the audience.  Given the unresponsive nature of the man in the rubber monkey suit, this was certainly a difficult task
The wide screen print does look pretty good, and special features include a theatrical trailer for The Mighty Peking Man along with trailers for Switchblade Sisters (1975) and From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (2000).

1075654,3,6305809968,"When I bought this movie, I was surprised to see that this was actually a Shaw Brothers movie produced by the legendary, Runme Shaw.  The Shaw Brothers produced some of the greatest martial art flicks of all time such as ""Chinese Super Ninja,"" ""5 Deadly Venoms,"" ""The Crippled Avengers,"" etc.  So I repeat, I was very surprised to see them fund a movie about a giant monster.
To be honest, I'm not quite sure what kind of movie this really is.  You could really just say this is a very bad rip-off of ""King Kong.""  And it's a really bizarre movie to say the least.  But since it features a giant monster, I'll grade it as a giant monster movie.
As a giant monster flick, I can't give this movie a good grade, because the Monster scenes are very bad compared to a Toho film like ""Godzilla.""  Yes, the monster scenes are hilarious, but if I were to compare the monster scenes to any other monster flick, this would probably be the worst of the lot.  I'm going to say this primarily because of the filming techniques - and yes, I'm well-aware that Toho movies aren't exactly perfect examples of movie-making, but they do set the standard of movie-making when it comes to giant monsters.
The biggest problems with the monster scenes is that the camera is constantly cutting back-and-forth at incredible speeds to show a single action.  In a ""Godzilla"" movie, a lot of action is filmed without cutting to a new angle: for example, if Godzilla were to crush a building, the camera would show the Big G swinging into the edifice and crushing it all in a single take.  But in ""The Mighty Peking Man,"" the camera would first show the Peking Man's face, then cut to his arms going in the air, then cut to a new angle of the building, then cut back to show Peking Man crashing into the building.  All of the cutting seems to be a little disorienting and detracts from the monster scene's impact.
Another problem is that there are many scenes where human characters are looking at Peking Man, but the method used to show the humans and monster together is very bad.  It looks like they're screaming at a t.v projection.
FYI - The monster action featured here consists of Monster-Human Bonding, Monster Vs. Military, and of course, Monster Trashing City.
Now for the Human Scenes - there is so much fun stuff happening here!  You've got your horrible editing, horrendous voice-actors, over-acting galore, exploitation camera shots of Samantha, and other bizarre situations that totally defy all logic...you just have to see this movie to believe it!
Let me just say that I really like the dubbing - very typical Shaw stuff here.  My favourite part of the dubbing is when a character has a lot to say.  It seems as if he takes one long breath, then spews out 2-3 lines without pausing between sentences.  For example, Johnny is talking to his brother on the phone, and this is what the brother says:
""You sound great right now I'm recording a t.v show listen it'll take another hour why don't you come right now.""  (notice there are no pauses in there)
Oh, and about that monster...
The title monster (Peking Man) is a giant ape who is infatuated with a bodacious blonde in animal skin, Samantha.  It's funny that they call him the ""Peking Man"" since the real Peking Man (of the REAL world) probably looked more like a human than an ape, and he was probably around 5ft tall.  In this movie, the Peking Man is an straight-out ape showing no physical similarities to a modern-day human (except that it stands upright like the 'Homo Erectus' should), and well, it's several stories tall.  I'm no anthropologist, but I definitely know that this is no Peking Man!  But he's certainly great fun!  And as for that costume, it's probably worse than the King Kong suit worn in ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" which makes things even more fun whenever the apeman makes an appearance.
In any case, here are some hilarious situations that I remembered from the movie:
SITUATION 1
While the Peking Man is trashing a village, the local militia start pelting the monster with a plethora of rocks.  The Peking Man stands there for a minute or so getting hit by rocks, but soon enough, he decides to retaliate by picking up an incredibly huge boulder and flinging it towards the villagers.  (yeah, they should've saw that coming)
SITUATION 2
When the expeditionary team is paving its way through the jungle, a bengal tiger bites the leg off of one of the native escorts.  As the native is crying in agony, the Chinese man in charge mysteriously shoots the man in the head just before they can administer aid.  When Johnny questions him about it, the guy replies that he simply ended the native's suffering.  He also mutters something about saving the medicine until they really need it (I suppose death wasn't a real emergency).
SITUATION 3
This isn't really a situation, but a whole series of them.  Ok, Samantha is a blonde bombshell, and she looks great!  The director obviously exploited this to full-effect throughout the movie.  During the movie, you'll see many shots of her rear, a nipple, and even a scene where this dude pours wine down her chest.  And throughout the movie, Samantha sports her animal-skin attire which is very flattering for her figure.
Overall, this wasn't a great monster movie due to the weak Monster Scenes.  But don't get me wrong, I was totally entertained - just not in a Godzilla-kinda way.  And that's why this movie doesn't get topmarks.  But do yourself a favor, and watch this movie - you'll have a great time!

1075655,5,6305809968,"Mighty Peking Man is literally a Hong Kong rip off of Dino DeLaurentis' own 76' remake of King Kong, making it a rip off of a rip off! It actually steals entire scenes from the movie! But who cares! The Sheena-like jungle girl is Playboy material HOT! And she is in danger the entire movie of losing her skimpy top! The Peking Man costume is bad, but certainly no worse than the multimillion dollar 40 foot tall Kong used in the 76' remake for all of 4 seconds, and the Peking man costume was made at a fraction of the cost. The fake helicopters and tanks, buildings, ect are no worse than anything in a Toho Godzilla flick. And the movie has a cheesy/sleazy 70's groove to it if you can dig, man. Worth the price of the DVD is the scene where ""Sheena"" and Johnny are falling in love in slow motion to a horrible ""Mellow Gold"" love song. If you though ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" was the worst film ever, or the best of the ""So bad they're great"" watch the Peking Man with a bunch of intoxicated friends, and you will not be disappointed!",996883200,13,1036,4.237373737373737

It's basically a really, really bad re-telling of the King Kong story. The blonde seemed to be based on the character Rima from the novel ""Green Mansions"". My favorite part of this stinker was watching for her to fall out of her animal skin bra. It is good for a few laughs, though, so keep this one in the closet unless you are doing some good drugs.

Kraft is a good looking blonde, Nordic woman. In the old days, only Chinese people were the stars of Hong Kong films. Hong Kong in Mandarin Chinese is ""xianggang/sh-yang-gong"".

Said catastrophe has released the enormous title creature -some poor shlub in a hairy suit- to crush some villagers. A team, led by Johnnie Fang (Danny Lee) is assembled to find the towering Ape-Monster. Along the way, Johnnie tells his cohorts the sad tale of his lost love, while sorrowful music plays.
