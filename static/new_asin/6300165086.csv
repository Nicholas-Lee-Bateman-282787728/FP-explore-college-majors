214014,5,6300165086,"This movie is amazingly good. Originally made for television in 1982, this film is based on the true story of a brutal murder that took place in Georgia in 1948. The production is beautifully directed and shot, and the sets, props, and vehicles look very authentic; above all else the acting is superb from the entire cast.

Playing against his stereotype is Andy Griffith as John Wallace, the ""King"" of Merriwether County, Georgia. Wallace is a brutal man with an iron grip on the community. The pivotal murder is cleverly staged, but Wallace's fundamental error is to become embroiled in a car chase that takes him into Coweta County, where the murder actually occurs.

In Coweta County the Sheriff is Lamar Potts, portrayed with strength and nuance by Johnny Cash, who refuses to be intimidated by Wallace. The investigation process and courtroom scenes are particularly well done. The climax occurs when Wallace takes the stand in his own defense with an unreal account of the killing.

Particularly noteworthy are the scenes with the psychic, who I knew I recognized, but couldn't put my finger on until the very end of the movie due to the excellent makeup (and acting). The surprise for me was that the psychic was none other than June Carter Cash, who shines in her role. The chilling portrayal by Griffith is amazing, and is visually stunning at the end as his head is shaved and he is strapped to the electric chair. (It's also a visual wake up call to see Johnny Cash in a color other than black.) The entire supporting cast is particularly good.

This is a very powerful movie, not corny or over dramatized: the story and acting are as powerful as any other crime drama I have ever seen. This movie is relatively obscure, but it is worth searching for.

I could not recommend this film more highly.",1100736000,106,1810,4.715189873417722
214015,4,6300165086,"This is a well done made-for-tv movie from the early 80's.  The movie is faithful to the source material, namely a book of the same name.  The story is a true tale of a man who was the king of a county in rural Georgia in the latee 1940's.  The trial aspect of the film raises the question of whether a man can be tried for capital murder without a body.  True, this is not bizarre in today's world but it was 50 years ago.

The performances of both Andy Griffith and Johnny Cash are fun to watch.  Andy Griffith plays against form as the amoral and ruthless John Wallace.  No Andy Taylor and Opie here.  Johnny Cash puts in a fine performance as Sheriff Lamar Potts, the hero of the story.  Look for Earl Hindman, Wilson of ""Home Improvement"", to step out from behind the fence.",1053302400,54,779,4.244897959183674

It is hard to wrap your mind around Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith playing opposite characters of what they are normally remembered for.  What is even better, this is based on a true story that was not uncommon for the time and setting it which it is cast. This is definitely a classic that can be viewed again and again over the years.",1518393600,,426,4.379746835443038
214078,4,6300165086,"This is an excellent t.v. movie.  Based on true story.  Andy Griffith who is an excellent villain.  Plays the head of a County.  The sheriff is in his pocket.  He gives money to the Church and everybody in the County looks up to him.  He has too much power and a a dark side.  When one of his workers steal's a cow from him.  That dark side comes out.
Johnny Cash plays the sheriff of the next county.  And he will stop at nothing to bring him down and find out the truth.  And he turns out to be the one that you don't want to stand against.  And he and his men end up never firing a shot.  This is another great, great t.v. movie that could have just as easily been a theatrical release.  And the acting by both Andy Griffith and Johnny Cash is just as good as anything DeNiro or Daniel Day-Lewis ever did.",1511222400,,808,4.037974683544304
214079,4,6300165086,"I have to say that a TV movie from the 80s with Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith didn't really appeal to me but I went with the 7.5 IMDb score and was pleasantly surprised. As usual, Johnny has little to no range of emotion but Andy was delightfully out of character and really held this movie together as the boss of his county. Very well done and other than the square format that I dislike it was not at all what I expected and were glad we finally got around to watching it.",1511049600,,475,4.118279569892473

214106,5,6300165086,"At first I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this movie, but I'm glad I did. I was born in 1949 so it was fun seeing the old cars and how the town folks dressed...reminded me of the small Tennessee town I grew up in. Well, things have certainly changed since 1948, forensic science convicts many felons today without eyewitnesses, but in 1948 justice was swift, unlike today when it takes 15+ years for an execution to be carried out; that is, if the state has capital punishment. I recommend this movie--well worth watching.",1510099200,,521,4.553191489361702

You actually could have swapped the roles between Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith and it would have been just as good. They were excellent. The settings were wonderful and the majority of the cast were so good you didn't feel as though they were acting. So many good lines but my favorite was when the lady that did readings told Johnny Cash that her brother died in the war. When he said he was sorry,she said ""That's ok. I still talk to him.""

214110,3,6300165086,"The story of John Wallace is a fascinating one. Unfortunately, this movie is not very well done. Andy Griffith is superb as Wallace and carries the film. However, Johnny Cash is just dreadful as Sheriff Potts and that ruined the movie for me. Even worse is June Carter's performance as Mayhayley Lancaster. There's a lot more to acting than putting on makeup that ages you 20 years. Griffith's performance and the story itself make this worth watching it it's free on a rainy afternoon.",1503964800,,486,4.7976190476190474

214113,5,6300165086,This is one of the best movies ever. You would think that a older movie wouldnt be fil d that well or the acting wouldnt be that good. But it was awesome! I would recommend it to anyone it is well worth it and it does a great job of showing how life was back in the days with certain people and corruption back then could be even worse. The best thing is that for those that are use to watching Andy Griffith play a good guy your in for a surprise. Also a little history lesson on Andy he met his wife while filming this. She was the young woman married to Wilson turner in this movie. Also Johnny Cash done a great Job as the Sheriff and his wife June was great as well playing Sally the witch.

He does a good job playing a bad guy, which says a lot about his acting ability. Johnny Cash was excellent...I've only heard him sing. This was a good old fashioned good vs evil. There is some politically sensitive language in the movie, but that's how people spoke back in the 40's. I think it was mentioned twice in the movie.",1494374400,3,466,4.306818181818182

214169,5,6300165086,"This murder took place on county away from where I live.  It does a fairly good job at following the book by the same title written by Margaret A. Barnes.  But it takes some getting use to with the two main actors.  One would that Andy Griffith would be the good guy and Johnny Cash the bad.  But that is not the case.  That being said, knowing some of the personality of both men, they do somehow fit the roll that they play.  It is great Central Georgia history.  While it may not rate high on the big screen scale, it is a wonderful movie and an insight to the character of bad people every where.",1488153600,5,600,4.120689655172414

It had no padding and no distracting sub-plots; it just told a grim story straight through, incident by incident, with excellent acting. I was surprised to see Andy Griffith playing such an unsympathetic character. I had read somewhere that, after making A Face in the Crowd, he had not wanted to play the role of a destructive character again, because it was hard on him and his family. But he did a great job portraying the ""king"" of his county, and Johnny Cash did a good job as the non-nonsense sheriff who would not be diverted from his mission to see that justice was done. All in all, a somewhat disturbing film because of its harsh reality, but very worthwhile. Oh, and one final note: I had not realized that Johnny Cash's wife, June Carter Cash, could act as well as sing, but she gave a great performance in a memorable role as the ""witch.""",1484438400,12,1001,4.535911602209945

214282,5,6300165086,"Murder in Coweta County is a gripping movie featuring standout performances from lead stars Andy Griffith and Johnny Cash. Griffith plays one of his rare villainous roles. His portrayal of killer John Wallace reminds me at times of the way he played Lonesome Rhodes in A Face in the Crowd. In my opinion, this movie is must-have for anybody who is a fan of Griffith. He can be quite disturbing when he's trying to be, and as weird as it is to think, ""Man, I would NOT want to get on Andy Griffith's bad side,"" this movie makes me think it. He does a great job playing a pretty crazy guy, and he is altogether captivating in the movie's truly chilling climax and conclusion. Cash plays the sheriff of Coweta County trying to piece together Wallace's most recent crime, which happened in his jurisdiction. His acting as a hardboiled country detective who just happens to be a sheriff is fantastic. His deadpan, stoic facial expressions and delivery have just the perfect amount of intensity to make his character very memorable. At one point, he shows up to make an arrest and tells the family protecting the suspect, ""The first one who touches one of my deputies, I'm gonna kill him."" The line is very calm, but ominously stern. The conviction in Cash's voice leads me to think that if any of the actors had stepped in Cash's way during the filming of that scene, Johnny would have killed him on the spot. The man sounds like he really means it, no acting involved. Great stuff. While I'm talking about these characters like they're fictional, this would be a good point to mention that this made-for-TV movie was based on a true story, making the crimes involved even more appalling. The racial component of the film, set in 1948, is surprisingly poignant in the racially charged atmosphere of 2016, and makes the movie a more dramatic, powerful piece than it was when it was initially released in 1983. It has a healthy number of glowing reviews, so the movie is no secret, but I only found out about it recently, and I'm obviously glad I did. I've been to the Andy Griffith museum in North Carolina several times, and only the last time this past summer did I notice the items related to this movie. While Andy kind of plays second fiddle to Cash in this one, his maniacal performance makes Cash's possible. They're both great, though, and I'd recommend this movie to just about anybody who likes good movies, fan of Griffith and Cash or not.",1482796800,,2444,4.6077981651376145

Cash surprised me at how old he looked for a man of 52. He did not act badly, but there was not much nuance or oomph to his performance. On the other hand, June Carter gave a memorable performance as a fortune teller and psychic. Overall, a film worth seeing. 4 1/2 stars.",1476835200,3,522,4.391752577319588

Griffith is a creepily evil county kingpin (such a contrast to his Sheriff Taylor) and Cash is a low-key but sardonic and determined sheriff who methodically works the case to bring Griffith down for murder. Scenery, dialogue, and atmosphere capture the era, and don't miss June Carter Cash is a great character role. If you enjoy Forensic Files, 20/20, or American Justice, or just like old southern gothic movies, it might be worth watching - make sure to give it time to get going. The book on which is it based it also worth the read, and contains more details about persons involved and reasons why the case achieved such notoriety (some of which are left out of the movie).",1464652800,,873,4.75

214414,5,6300165086,"(Updated Jan. 2017 after another viewing) What a great movie, far better than many ""Made for TV"" films with big names and no plot (it is full screen only as all TV was in 1983).  This has a wonderful script, great production values, excellent photography and a stellar cast.  Based on a real murder that took place in 1948 (a month after I was born), and very well adapted from the book of the same title, it is a well paced story of murder and justice.  Andy Griffith plays the nasty ruler of ""The Kingdom"" (his large land holdings) who has the entire county under his thumb.  He and his family have run the corrupt county for years.  He is believable in the part, nastier than when he played ""Lonesome"" Rhodes in ""A Face in the Crowd"".  Johnny Cash plays the sheriff in the next county and a righteous man.  He comes across as a real life good guy, well acted.  June Carter Cash plays a back woods physic (under a ton of makeup) and does an excellent job of acting.  The supporting cast is just as good, good acting all around.
This is a bare bones DVD-R with no extras and I can live with that as the movie is so good but it would be nice if it had SDH captioning for the many old timers that would enjoy this film.  The picture and sound are very good and it does not show its age as many Made for TV movies from the 70's and 80's do.  I am so disappointed that with all the great reviews I see of this movie it is not better known to the general public.  I would love to have a restored copy in Blu-ray with SDH, but without more popularity and a publisher interested in spending the money that is unlikely.  You really should give this a view on streaming or purchase the DVD (the price is right).  Well worth your time.
BE WARNED:  This is about rural Georgia in 1948 so the N-word does appear in a couple of scenes.  Only a couple of times but is necessary to the plot.  Please do not be offended.",1453248000,5,1905,4.16120218579235
214415,5,6300165086,"Great movie that i can watch over and over again and never get tired of watching. I lived in Newnan Ga. which is Coweta County about 30 years ago but now live across the line in Carrollton,Ga.",1452902400,2,192,4.216216216216216
214416,5,6300165086,"Andy Griffith actually played bad guys in a number of movies, but this was probably his best performance in such a role.  The movie is based on a true story.  John Wallace, portrayed by Griffith, is a wealthy landowner in Merriweather County, Georgia.  Because he wields so much power and influence, he thinks he's above the law.  One day he and his friends kill one of his tenant farmers who dared to cross him.  However, Wallace makes one mistake: he kills the man in Coweta County, where Lamar Potts is the sheriff.  Unlike the sheriff in Merriweather County, Potts cannot be bought or intimidated, and he has the tenacity of a bulldog.  The movie details his efforts to find the truth.

Andy Griffith is frighteningly convincing as the lawless and arrogant John Wallace, and Johnny Cash also gives a solid performance as the sheriff who's determined to bring him to justice.  Earl Hindman also appears in the movie as Lamar Potts' brother and deputy.  He later became famous as Wilson on ""Home Improvement"", and fans of that show will be interested in seeing what he really looks like!  Though it is somewhat disturbing seeing Andy Griffith as a villain, the movie is still intriguing and well-worth viewing.",1452124800,2,1212,4.806763285024155

214691,5,6300165086,"I saw this film many years ago and always wanted to see it again.  Being a fan of true crime and being from Georgia, this case was one that intrigued me.  I read the book many years after seeing the movie on TV.  Margaret Barnes book is chilling with details and the movie follows the book closely, like watching the book come alive.  John Wallace was a man who was the ruler of ""The Kingdom"".  No one went against him and he was basically allowed by the county Sherriff and everyone else to do what he wanted.  Wilson Turner was a poor man with a pregnant wife and a child on the way who was cheated out of money by Mr. Wallace.  So in the dead of night, Turner stole one of Wallace's prize cows and hid it away on another farm.  Wallace had him arrested, then the Sherriff let him go after plotting with Wallace and three other men to let Wallace exact his own form of revenge on Turner.  The rest of the story is sad, gruesome and a true testament to Sherriff Lamar Potts from Coweta County who refused to back down from Wallace and his supporters and a corrupt Sherriff in neighboring Meriweather County.  Sherriff Potts brought the entire ""kingdom"" down and Wallace was executed for his crimes, based on the testimony of the two negroes that he forced to help him dispose of the body.  If you have read the book, see the movie.  If you have seen the movie, read the book.  If you like old true crime stories this is a must see.",1399161600,7,1432,4.2592592592592595

214935,3,6300165086,"This movie does have excellent acting in it.  But one needs to keep in mind that although it is based on a true story, it is not an accurate representation of the facts.  The movie is based on the work of Ms. Barnes.  Her work has reportedly been dubed by the El Paso Times as calling it ""the new fictionalized style of recording historic events"".

There is a reason for that.  It is disheartening to see her work reported as fact over and over again.  John Wallace was not a monster and Lamar Potts was not a Saint.

The testimony in the court case would have us believe that one could take a body and cremate it to ashes overnight, while outdoors with nothing but a cord of fresh cut pine wood and some gasoline. It is not possible to cremate a body to ashes in this way.  Yet Potts needed a body so one was manufactured with a few bone fragments that was only attested to as being human.  How old the bones were or who they belonged to were never attested to at the trial.

To sum up, the movie has great acting but it is not a true representation of the actual case.  John Wallace was sentenced and died by the electric chair but he was not the man that he was portrayed as being in the book.  There were a great deal of strange and peculiar things that occurred during his ""so called"" trial.

directed by Gary Nelson
approximately 1 hour 30 minutes

This is a classic made for TV movie starring Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith.  It is based on the book with the same title, which in turn was based on a true story of murder and justice in western Georgia.

Andy Griffith plays John Wallace, owner of a huge section of land that is nicknamed ""The Kingdom"".  He is a ruthless boss, but presents himself to the public as a friendly Christian.  His power is so great that he exerts influence of the entirety of Meriweather County (where the Kingdom is located).  A disagreement with one of his workers ultimately leads to the event described in the movie's title.  Had the killing occurred in Meriweather, Wallace would certainly get away clean. Coweta County, on the other hand is outside of Wallace's sphere of influence, and happens to be the jurisdiction of a Sheriff named Lamar Potts.

Potts is played by country music star Johnny Cash.  He is a no-nonsense man with a history of seeking justice in every case presented to him.  He believes that no man - even a man as wealthy and powerful as John Wallace - is above the law.  When Sheriff Potts takes on the case, Wallace's people do everything in their power to evade and obstruct the investigation.  We are left to wonder whether anybody will be held accountable for the murder, with the climax coming in the movie's trial sequence.

This movie is excellent.  Andy Griffith is great as a villain, definitely a contrast to his two best-known television roles.  Johnny Cash is also cast very well.  I would actually count it as one of my favorite TV movies of all time!",1256688000,3,1658,4.626712328767123

215028,5,6300165086,I have always liked Johnny Cash but never realized how good an actor he could be. He was outstanding in this movie.,1214956800,4,115,4.2727272727272725
215029,5,6300165086,"I actually grew up and live in Coweta County, Georgia, so I am familiar with this famous local story.  I saw this movie on TV when I was young, and when I saw it available on DVD, I had to have it.  I was afraid that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered, but I was wrong.  Very good writing, directing, acting, and music.  It's a made-for-TV movie, so don't expect a big-budget blockbuster, but for what it is, it is a very well-done movie.  Highly recommended.",1213920000,29,463,4.215909090909091
215030,4,6300165086,"I saw this movie on TV when it first came out and really popped for the casting of Johnny Cash and especially Andy Griffith as a 'real' evil character. After years of seeing him as the wholesome good guy Andy Taylor it was great to see Andy's acting range and he hit it out of the park. I understand that this movie was based on a true story and a book with the same title. I never read the book and had no knowledge of the story before I saw the movie. I pulled the movie out the other day and watched it and I must say that it totally holds up. The casting is perfect and the director really takes you back to the period with all the cars, the wardrobe and the look of the film.

I recommend this movie to anybody who likes good movies and good story telling.",1200441600,6,761,4.006578947368421
215031,5,6300165086,"I'm resorting to this forum to briefly review three super Andy Griffith TV movies, especially for Andy Griffith fans. These movies are NOT yet  available on either VHS or DVD as far as I can discover.... but you might catch them on TV if you're lucky. They are: ""The Girl in the Empty Grave"" (1977); ""Deadly Game"" (a.k.a., ""It's Deadly,"" 1977), and; ""Winter Kill"" (1974).

All three of these films are ""cosy murders"" where Andy Griffith plays a small-town California police chief/sheriff -- they all sort of manifest the general flavor of his TV series but are just a little more serious. In the first two films, he plays police chief Abel Marsh and in the latter he plays Sheriff Sam McNeill.

The supporting cast includes timeless characters, (some are just a little goofy), reminiscent of the TV series. The locations are spectacular in a little resort town in the mountains of Northern California. The sets are also very good.

In ""The Girl in the Empty Grave,"" police chief Abel Marsh tries to track down a girl who was supposedly killed in a car wreck but who has been seen driving through his tiny resort town once her parents have been murdered.

In ""Deadly Game,"" the U.S. Military creates a chemical spill when one of their trucks overturns... murder ensues and police chief Abel Marsh ATTEMPTS to investigate but runs into problems. It's a nice folksy mystery for a rainy Saturday afternoon.

In ""Winter Kill"" Sheriff Sam McNeill works to solve the mystery of a sniper in his little ski resort town. A young Nick Nolte appears in the supporting cast!

If you enjoyed The Andy Griffith Show, or ""Murder in Coweta County,"" don't miss these three fun films. Hopefully, the copyright owners will  reduce them to DVD very soon but there's a chance that if you scan the TV Guide, you can catch them on television.

Please comment if this information was helpful to you -- I'd like to enter more posts like this one on films not yet available if it helps out viewers and fans.",1198886400,7,1980,4.666666666666667
215032,5,6300165086,"Wonderful movie, better than I imagined. Very different character for Andy Griffith, but very well played. Johnny Cash did an excellent job portraying the ""Good"" sheriff. He didn't miss a beat & also had a sense of humor. June Carter Cash played a very colorful character, didn't even recognize her at the beginning, but she did a remarkable job playing that role. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a true Johnny Cash fan. I loved it...it's a terrific movie for the family.",1153699200,3,485,4.7176470588235295
