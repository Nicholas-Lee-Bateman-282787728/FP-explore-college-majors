3146739,5,B0015Q818G,"One of the best TV series we've watched in years.  Original, well written and produced, and the cast played their parts perfectly.  It may help that I grew up in the UK during the period in which this is set but, even if you did not, it should still be well worth the view - you don't need to understand all the references but you'll probably get more out of it if you do.

I don't often like sequels but have been sufficiently impressed by this that I'll be watching Ashes To Ashes as soon as I can get my hands on the DVDs.

Highly recommended for anyone that grew up in the 70s.  Recommended for anyone that enjoys great (British) TV series.",1246752000,,644,4.203252032520325
3146740,5,B0015Q818G,"Sam Tyler is still stuck in 1973, unsure if he has somehow really travelled backwards in time or if he is merely stuck in a coma in 2006 and is fantasising everything that is happening to him. However, now he has been there for a few weeks he is getting more used to life in the 1970s and is starting to downplay the unusual auditory and visual hallucinations he continues to suffer from. But, just as things seem to be settling down, questions about Sam's previous 1970s life in 'Hyde' before relocating to Manchester arise, and set in chain a sequence of events which could lead Sam home...wherever that is.

Life on Mars' second season was the last, due to a combination of the producers not wishing to over-exploit the concept and lead actor John Simm's well-known reluctance to be typecast in a long-running television series. It was a bold decision for a series that had become a big hit on British television and done the seemingly impossible by getting audiences fired up over a cop show.

The second season offers up pretty much more of the same as the first season: Sam and Gene butt heads over their different approaches to policing, but they have, grudgingly, accepted that each has skills the other does not, and when they combine their approaches it often leads to good results. Sam and Annie continue to not quite get it together in the tradition of all great TV will-they, won't-they romances, and Sam continues to be haunted by hallucinations of his life in 2006 which relate to his current situation in 1973. The show also moves onto slightly more contentious ground in Season 2 by covering the more controversial subject of IRA terrorism in one episode whilst continuing to examine the extent of corruption and heavy-handed methods in the 1970s police force.

In my review of Season 1, I mentioned that the show's continuous use of Sam's odd mental state occasionally gets a little exasperating, as sometimes you'd quite like to just see Sam and Gene butt heads and then solve the crime without Sam freaking out every twenty minutes. The producers play on this in two episodes in particular in the second season, one in which Sam doesn't have any odd experiences and starts getting worried about the lack of them, and another in which Sam reacts very badly to whatever is happening to him in the present and has to sit most of the investigation out. This latter episode, which is by far the most 'freak-out' intensive of the series, also perversely is one of the very best episodes, with flashbacks showing how they operated before he arrived (and giving rise to the unusual sight of scenes not featuring Sam, which feels odd as he is in every other single scene of every other episode of the whole series).

Of course, as good as the individual episodes are (and they are pretty damn good), the one episode that everyone will be left talking about is the very last one. British SF is awash with series-ending episodes that leave the audience reeling and talking about them for years or decades afterwards: Blake's 7, Sapphire and Steel and The Prisoner being the most notable (Quantum Leap's befuddling finale is probably the USA's closest equivalent). Life on Mars joins their august ranks with a finale that takes the viewer on a crazy existential rollercoaster ride as we finally get an answer for what is going on with Sam, but that answer is in turn supplanted by another, contradictory one in a manner that would make Christopher Priest proud. Which is the truth and which do we believe? The finale operates on multiple levels of reality with the viewer not quite able to trust what is going on. There is a very clear 'obvious' possible answer for what is going on, but just as with David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, that 'obvious' answer still leaves other, key questions unanswered.

Taken in isolation, Life on Mars' finale is very strong indeed. However, the news that a sequel/spin-off series was forthcoming which would shed more light on events did dilute the strength of that finale a bit, and Ashes to Ashes' plot developments have indeed plunged much of what we thought we knew from Life on Mars' finale into doubt. But further examination of that series is for another review.

The second season of Life on Mars (****) is thoroughly entertaining, funny, thought-provoking and just the right side of ambiguous. It draws a line under the series and sets up the sequel series quite nicely. It is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and will be released in the USA on DVD in November.",1246060800,41,4518,4.734434561626429

Since it has not been released in the USA, this is one of the few ways to get a copy.  The video and audio quality are great (IT's nice to see Sam and Gene on my new big tv, and not have the commerical interruptions).  I highly recommend it, but be warned, it is not a copy made for the USA.  (Some Blu-Ray players may have difficulty playing it, but none that I have found yet.

3146746,5,B0015Q818G,This is a great show.  One of my all time favorite British TV shows.  One cannot help but be drawn into Sam Tyler's story wondering what is real and what is not.  A must watch.... the UK version not the terrible American remake.,1377820800,,228,4.255813953488372

3146748,5,B0015Q818G,"I got onto the British version after watching the U.S. version on streaming Netflix - signed up for Amazon prime because of this.

So much better - the U.S. version was entertaining, but watching the U.K. version makes you realize the differences - the lack of melodramatic touches and the more consistent characters who are being themselves not just responding to plot devices - they are more real (ironic in a show in which reality is questionable).  The main lead (Sam Tyler) in the U.K. version would never be allowed to be the main lead in a U.S. show - he'd have to be a side-kick because he's not tall enough - looks like a ""regular bloke"".  The characters in the U.K. version are people, not so much types (still comic relief but they go beyond that).

I just watched the final episode of the U.K. version and it was perfect. I'm sad its over but it ended with great characterization.  The end of the U.S. verions was crap and a total cop-out. Not spoiling by saying more - just watch this.

As an added bonus I have more appreciation of David Bowie and the Irish band Thin Lizzie - who have a great rendition of Whiskey in the Jar which apparently was a big hit in 1972.",1344556800,,1179,4.385321100917431

ABC tried to do a US version and failed miserably, you can't just dress things up and try to pull them off.  British was part of the series!  No way you can do a direct ripoff.

What sucked was the lack of the ending episodes, BBC pulled this and hadn't released the ending of the show!  Finally both are out, don't go out of order or you'll miss something important.

3146756,5,B0015Q818G,"I realize the US tried to remake this show but I have to say, see the original first. Or just see the original. The premise sounds whacky: a modern-day British cop has a car accident and wakes up back in the 70s. Somehow it works fantastically, and I think the fact that the scripts all hold together throughout the entire 2 seasons and the brilliant acting make it so. (The American show had some good acting but the scripts waffled between retreads of the British show--which didn't work--and its own thing, which did work but were a little too little too late). The set dressing and costuming also compliment the rest of the production values so you don't feel like you're watching a half-baked attempt to evoke a bygone era for drama purposes. Well done all the way around.
The BluRay set is a slightly cleaner copy than the DVD but otherwise not dramatically better.",1338595200,,871,4.625806451612903

3146758,5,B0015Q818G,"Again and again, we see how the BBC's business model is less likely than its U.S. counterpart to encourage greedy people to milk a successful series until it's pitiful and exhausted.  The last several seasons of ""24"" exemplify this sorry American phenomenon.

In contrast, we have the second and final season of ""Life on Mars."" ""Life on Mars"" ran for only two years and concluded while it was still a huge hit in the UK.  The creative team wanted to finish the series while it was still strong.  In the second/final season, the series remained as intense as ever until the end, and the actors remained fresh in their roles.  The meditation on existentialism and human relationships took control in the _amazing_ series finale.  IMHO, the finale is on par with the series ending of ""The Wire,"" and much better than the finale of ""The Sopranos.""  Brilliant, brilliant work.",1320278400,2,871,4.805369127516778

3146760,5,B0015Q818G,"I truly enjoyed the American version of LOM. And this second UK LOM season was similar yet had many differences that makes one glad one watched both. Outstanding characters, powerful stories, and wonderful thought-provoking ideas interlaced with enjoyable entertainment. If you like stories about the 1970's, with a sci-fi twist, this will be a real delight.",1291161600,,358,5.410714285714286
3146761,2,B0015Q818G,"I bought both of the British series DVD's because I loved the American series. I give the American series a 5* rating. The storyline, the interaction between the characters, the details in the scenes, were all great. And I loved the American nostalgia. I just couldn't relate to the British version, probably because I didn't grow up there. The British version (original one) is probably just as good for them as the American version is for me.

3146762,5,B0015Q818G,"When I first heard about the American Life On Mars I thought ""Good lord. How does somebody come up with THAT?"" My wife and I watched the short-lived series and enjoyed it (All but the rushed and silly final episode). While searching for information online about the possibility of the show going to SyFy or some other channel I discovered the ""Real"" Life on Mars. If all you've seen is the pale American imitation, drop what you are doing and order Seasons 1 and 2 of the BBC original RIGHT NOW. (Even if you watched it on BBC America, you only saw 3/4 of each episode)

The performances are fantastic, the story is original and they don't pull any punches. John Simm is fantastic as the lost Sam Tyler and Philip Glenister tears it up as DCI Gene Hunt. After watching the BBC series I was frankly insulted by the dumbed-down American version. LOM takes us through Sam's journey into the past and leaves us satisfied when the series has run its course. The show is filled with great 70's-era music and is an incredible homage to the 70's cop genre while still filling the bill as a modern procedural.

Like a little cop show in your sci-fi? A little of the fantastic with your Starsky & Hutch? Pick up Life On Mars. You will NOT be sorry.",1278115200,15,1238,4.425438596491228
3146763,3,B0015Q818G,"Series 2 continues where 1 .. er .. continued.

Not until the last episode do we discover what was happening - and here it is:

An undercover detective with false identity is sent to investigate a police division in Manchester that has been breaking the rules. That undercover officer is given the identity of Sam (a dead person), but on his way to his assignment has a car accident which results in amnesia.

When he arrives at his new post all he can remember is being a detective from the future. He believes that none of what he is experiencing is real, but plays along because he is led to believe that when he finishes his assignment he will be sent home.

Sam's idea of home is 30 years in the future, when in reality his job is to get the dirt on Gene Hunt (Detective Chief Inspector) and he will be able to return to his post with C division in Hyde.

I wish I'd known this from the start of series 1. It doesn't make the crime investigations any more believable, but it would have been nice to have some idea of what was going on during the series's.

Ok, some will read the ending differently, but that is the plot that I prefer.

On the series itself, (there are another 7 episodes) as with series 1, each crime investigation is so full of holes you could drive a herd of camels through each episode.

The comedy is not funny after several repeats (count how many times Gene and Sam hit the same guy at the same time in an effort to show solidarity). Each episode starts with Sam and Gene arguing, but ends with them best buddies .. yawn, saw that last time.

I still don't get why so popular. Ok, the acting was good, but the scripts were just bland/predictable/unbelievable.

I really want to like this series, but it does little to inspire further watching until the ending. (Even that was silly. Sam and the whole crew escape from a train that is under siege by er .. running along the corridors. Sam gets back on good terms by shooting the only gunman left .. I guess the rest of the gang had got bored and had gone to the booozer.)

At least we finally got an answer to Sam's mental state.

But, just as things seem to be settling down, questions about Sam's previous 1970s life in 'Hyde' before relocating to Manchester arise, and set in chain a sequence of events which could lead Sam home...wherever that is.

Life on Mars' second season was the last, due to a combination of the producers not wishing to over-exploit the concept and lead actor John Simm's well-known reluctance to be typecast in a long-running television series. It was a bold decision for a series that had become a big hit on British television and done the seemingly impossible by getting audiences fired up over a cop show.

Sam and Annie continue to not quite get it together in the tradition of all great TV will-they, won't-they romances, and Sam continues to be haunted by hallucinations of his life in 2006 which relate to his current situation in 1973. The show also moves onto slightly more contentious ground in Season 2 by covering the more controversial subject of IRA terrorism in one episode whilst continuing to examine the extent of corruption and heavy-handed methods in the 1970s police force.

In my review of Season 1, I mentioned that the show's continuous use of Sam's odd mental state occasionally gets a little exasperating, as sometimes you'd quite like to just see Sam and Gene butt heads and then solve the crime without Sam freaking out every twenty minutes. The producers play on this in two episodes in particular in the second season, one in which Sam doesn't have any odd experiences and starts getting worried about the lack of them, and another in which Sam reacts very badly to whatever is happening to him in the present and has to sit most of the investigation out. This latter episode, which is by far the most 'freak-out' intensive of the series, also perversely is one of the very best episodes, with flashbacks showing how they operated before he arrived (and giving rise to the unusual sight of scenes not featuring Sam, which feels odd as he is in every other single scene of every other episode of the whole series).

Of course, as good as the individual episodes are (and they are pretty damn good), the one episode that everyone will be left talking about is the very last one. British SF is awash with series-ending episodes that leave the audience reeling and talking about them for years or decades afterwards: Blake's 7, Sapphire and Steel and The Prisoner being the most notable (Quantum Leap's befuddling finale is probably the USA's closest equivalent). Life on Mars joins their august ranks with a finale that takes the viewer on a crazy existential rollercoaster ride as we finally get an answer for what is going on with Sam, but that answer is in turn supplanted by another, contradictory one in a manner that would make Christopher Priest proud. Which is the truth and which do we believe? The finale operates on multiple levels of reality with the viewer not quite able to trust what is going on. There is a very clear 'obvious' possible answer for what is going on, but just as with David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, that 'obvious' answer still leaves other, key questions unanswered.

Taken in isolation, Life on Mars' finale is very strong indeed. However, the news that a sequel/spin-off series was forthcoming which would shed more light on events did dilute the strength of that finale a bit, and Ashes to Ashes' plot developments have indeed plunged much of what we thought we knew from Life on Mars' finale into doubt. But further examination of that series is for another review.

The second season of Life on Mars (****) is thoroughly entertaining, funny, thought-provoking and just the right side of ambiguous. It draws a line under the series and sets up the sequel series quite nicely. It is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and will be released in the USA on DVD in November.",1246060800,41,4518,4.734434561626429

So much better - the U.S. version was entertaining, but watching the U.K. version makes you realize the differences - the lack of melodramatic touches and the more consistent characters who are being themselves not just responding to plot devices - they are more real (ironic in a show in which reality is questionable).  The main lead (Sam Tyler) in the U.K. version would never be allowed to be the main lead in a U.S. show - he'd have to be a side-kick because he's not tall enough - looks like a ""regular bloke"".  The characters in the U.K. version are people, not so much types (still comic relief but they go beyond that).

I just watched the final episode of the U.K. version and it was perfect. I'm sad its over but it ended with great characterization.  The end of the U.S. verions was crap and a total cop-out. Not spoiling by saying more - just watch this.

As an added bonus I have more appreciation of David Bowie and the Irish band Thin Lizzie - who have a great rendition of Whiskey in the Jar which apparently was a big hit in 1972.",1344556800,,1179,4.385321100917431

The premise sounds whacky: a modern-day British cop has a car accident and wakes up back in the 70s. Somehow it works fantastically, and I think the fact that the scripts all hold together throughout the entire 2 seasons and the brilliant acting make it so. (The American show had some good acting but the scripts waffled between retreads of the British show--which didn't work--and its own thing, which did work but were a little too little too late). The set dressing and costuming also compliment the rest of the production values so you don't feel like you're watching a half-baked attempt to evoke a bygone era for drama purposes. Well done all the way around.

In contrast, we have the second and final season of ""Life on Mars."" ""Life on Mars"" ran for only two years and concluded while it was still a huge hit in the UK.  The creative team wanted to finish the series while it was still strong.  In the second/final season, the series remained as intense as ever until the end, and the actors remained fresh in their roles.  The meditation on existentialism and human relationships took control in the _amazing_ series finale.

My wife and I watched the short-lived series and enjoyed it (All but the rushed and silly final episode). While searching for information online about the possibility of the show going to SyFy or some other channel I discovered the ""Real"" Life on Mars. If all you've seen is the pale American imitation, drop what you are doing and order Seasons 1 and 2 of the BBC original RIGHT NOW. (Even if you watched it on BBC America, you only saw 3/4 of each episode)

The performances are fantastic, the story is original and they don't pull any punches. John Simm is fantastic as the lost Sam Tyler and Philip Glenister tears it up as DCI Gene Hunt. After watching the BBC series I was frankly insulted by the dumbed-down American version. LOM takes us through Sam's journey into the past and leaves us satisfied when the series has run its course. The show is filled with great 70's-era music and is an incredible homage to the 70's cop genre while still filling the bill as a modern procedural.

Like a little cop show in your sci-fi? A little of the fantastic with your Starsky & Hutch? Pick up Life On Mars. You will NOT be sorry.",1278115200,15,1238,4.425438596491228
3381260,3,B0015Q818G,"Series 2 continues where 1 .. er .. continued.

Not until the last episode do we discover what was happening - and here it is:

An undercover detective with false identity is sent to investigate a police division in Manchester that has been breaking the rules. That undercover officer is given the identity of Sam (a dead person), but on his way to his assignment has a car accident which results in amnesia.

When he arrives at his new post all he can remember is being a detective from the future. He believes that none of what he is experiencing is real, but plays along because he is led to believe that when he finishes his assignment he will be sent home.

Sam's idea of home is 30 years in the future, when in reality his job is to get the dirt on Gene Hunt (Detective Chief Inspector) and he will be able to return to his post with C division in Hyde.

I wish I'd known this from the start of series 1. It doesn't make the crime investigations any more believable, but it would have been nice to have some idea of what was going on during the series's.

Ok, some will read the ending differently, but that is the plot that I prefer.

On the series itself, (there are another 7 episodes) as with series 1, each crime investigation is so full of holes you could drive a herd of camels through each episode.

The comedy is not funny after several repeats (count how many times Gene and Sam hit the same guy at the same time in an effort to show solidarity). Each episode starts with Sam and Gene arguing, but ends with them best buddies .. yawn, saw that last time.

I still don't get why so popular. Ok, the acting was good, but the scripts were just bland/predictable/unbelievable.

I really want to like this series, but it does little to inspire further watching until the ending. (Even that was silly. Sam and the whole crew escape from a train that is under siege by er .. running along the corridors. Sam gets back on good terms by shooting the only gunman left .. I guess the rest of the gang had got bored and had gone to the booozer.)

At least we finally got an answer to Sam's mental state.
