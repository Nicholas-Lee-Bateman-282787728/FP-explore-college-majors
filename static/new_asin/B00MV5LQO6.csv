8674818,5,B00MV5LQO6,"This should not be your first Trovatore video. For that I strongly recommend the one with Jose Cura and Hvorostovsky which is better sung..
But as an alternative thoughtful interpretation, this video is outstanding. It is also uncut containing two verses of the great cabalettas
Tu vedrai and Di quel pira.",1494806400,,306,5.019607843137255
8674819,1,B00MV5LQO6,"Buyer Beware: Amazon does it again.  Amazon very often posts reviews of operas and other classical cd's and dvd's that are NOT of the recordings they are listed under.  This DVD has not yet been released, but one can read on the cover who the singers are.  The reviews--some of a CD set--are sprinkled with references to other singers, several reviews refer to quite old and even vinyl releases.
The upshot: WHENEVER reading reviews of classical music and especially opera DVD's at Amazon, double-check to confirm that the review you're reading is a review of product under which it's listed.",1413936000,15,592,4.9
8674820,4,B00MV5LQO6,"There's a case to be made for putting a little distance between the drama and the telling of it in Verdi's potboiler, Il Trovatore. The plot is a difficult one to carry-off convincingly, but as it happens, all the melodrama is already kept at a certain distance through how the characters relate their own stories. It's undoubtedly with this in mind that Dmitri Tcherniakov stages this production at La Monnaie in Brussels with the framing device of it being related, relived and re-enacted at some date in the future by the main protagonists. Considering the bloody fates of many of those characters, it is however a bit of a stretch to imagine them meeting up some years later, but if the concept is a somewhat dubious, the approach does refreshingly bring out new elements to an overly-familiar work.

Like figures from some Agatha Christie mystery where the main suspects have been assembled in a drawing room, the five main characters in Verdi's drama turn up in the silent prologue, Leonora in a dark wig and wearing sunglasses, Manrico in a snakeskin jacket.  Warily, after years of separation, they edge around each other as Azucena locks the door to the room, keeping them captive there to work through the events that have occurred in order to ""shed light on the tragic past that has united their destinies"". Taking place entirely within the confines of a single room, one of Verdi's most bombastic operas is reduced almost to a chamber piece. It does abandon many of the tired stage conventions and mannerisms that have become associated with this old standard, but controversially, it goes further than this in musical terms.  Most significantly, the cast are reduced down to only five people and the chorus, who have a large part in this opera, are kept off-stage throughout. Other roles such as Inez and Ruiz, are not actually suppressed, but sung through the doubling up of roles as the drama is re-enacted by the main players.

It's an interesting cast too, but not one that particularly impresses. Some might think that the singing lacks the necessary dynamic, power and expansiveness, but this is undoubtedly intentional. Scott Hendricks comes across the best here as the Conte di Luna, letting himself go with the flow of the concept, although he does also have perhaps the most expressive role in the opera. Misha Didyk is not my kind of Verdi singer, his choked back anguished delivery lacking any variety in vocal expression and there's no real acting ability here either. Sylvie Brunet-Grupposo is a smaller-scale Azucena than is usually required, but she suits the tone here, as does Marina Poplavskaya as Leonora. Her technique isn't always the smoothest when making the transition to the higher notes, but she has exactly that kind of expressive voice that is needed to bring depth to characterisation. Reportedly ill at the time, she looks a little uncomfortable here and seems restricted by the admittedly bizarre concept.

Overall however, Tcherniakov's direction feels a bit weak, cutting away much of the baggage of the work certainly, but also restricting the drama with a concept that doesn't really stand up to close scrutiny. One might be happy to make some allowances in credibility to see something fresh and new brought out of Il Trovatore, but other than one or two scenes - the closing bloodbath ending certainly registers the requisite shocks - this is rarely achieved dramatically here. Musically, Marc Minkowski's conducting of the La Monnaie orchestra - his first time conducting Verdi - is much more interesting, his treatment suiting Tcherniakov's idea of a chamber production, while at the same time finding the strengths in Verdi's score and successfully getting its underlying power across without unnecessary overemphasis.  Plenty of heat generated in the pit then, but not enough fire on the stage.",1413763200,8,3849,5.01564945226917
