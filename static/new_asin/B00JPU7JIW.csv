Since the films are older the picture quality matches the time, though I do think they were remastered a bit - good SD.  The Bellboy was such a different film because Jerry doesn't speak until the end, which totally makes him a comedic genius!",1456704000,2,403,4.493150684931507

6388753,5,B00JPU7JIW,"Film buffs or Jerry Lewis aficionados will enjoy this collection of four of his most revered but hilarious films of the early 1960s shortly after his departure from the Martin and Lewis obligations that, too, contain the most unforgettable of films.  But every disc in the collection is worthwhile to watch because of Lewiss unique comedy style put to film that hearkens back to the days of slapstick and vaudeville.

For this viewers preference one cannot neglect to watch The Bellboy (1960).  Despite it being filmed in black and white, it is an effective and practical approach to portraying Lewiss character Stanley who does not speak at all within the entire film until the end when he is asked, how come you do not speak, and he answers within the lines of, cause no one ever asked me to.  The film contains an array of Hollywood favorites of the day, especially a cameo from comedy great Milton Berle.  The fun continues with The Ladies Man (1961) and once again, a complete barrel full of laughs that viewers will no doubt experience; this film is in color and has Lewis playing a houseboy Herbert at an all-women boarding house.  And the last two discs also very humorous and follows in the tradition of Charlie Chaplin The Patsy (1964) in color, a somewhat rags to riches storyline and plays another Stanley, check out the memorable scene where Stanley creates his own tux and tails  simply a touch of Hollywood and The Errand Boy (1961) in black and white and similar to The Bellboy where he plays Morty a mail room clerk.

If anything may bring delight to movie watching, any Jerry Lewis film will.",1445212800,6,1610,4.684397163120567

6388789,5,B00JPU7JIW,"This budget collection is an excellent way to get four of Jerry Lewis' best movies, when he was young, and in his prime.  The only minor complaint is the packaging.  The DVD case includes one long spindle, on which the four discs are placed, one on top of the other.  The movie ""The Bellboy"" (1960) was written, directed and produced by Jerry Lewis. Stanley (Jerry Lewis) is a mostly mute bellboy, working at the Fountainbleau Hotel in Miami Beach.  Famous entertainers stay at the hotel, including Milton Berle and Jerry Lewis.  In fact, Stanley's resemblance to Jerry Lewis causes multiple merry mix-ups!  The film ""The Ladies Man"" (1961) was co-written and directed by Jerry Lewis.  Herbert H. Heebert (Jerry Lewis) loses his girlfriend and swears off romance.  Naturally, he gets a job as a houseboy at an all-female boarding house!  Speaking of women, Jerry also has an early scene where he hilariously plays his mother, Mama Heebert.

The movie ""The Errand Boy"" (1961) was co-written and directed by Jerry Lewis.  Morty Tashman (Jerry Lewis) is ostensibly hired to be an errand boy at Paramutual Movie Studios.  He's really supposed to sneak around the lot, to report on where the company's money is being spent.  Ironically, the man he is supposed to report his findings to is named Dexter Sneak (Howard McNear).  The movie ""The Patsy"" (1964) was co-written and directed by Jerry Lewis.  Stanley Belt (Jerry Lewis) is a bumbling bellhop, similar to his character Stanley in ""The Bellboy"" (1960).  In this movie, a very famous comedian is killed in a plane crash.  The star's management team, including Caryl Fergusson (Everett Sloane), Harry Silver (Keenan Wynn), Chic Wymore (Phil Harris), Bruce Alden (John Carradine), Morgan Heywood (Peter Lorre), and Ellen Betz (Ina Balin), want to keep the money rolling in.  They hire no-talent Stanley Belt, and groom him to be a star.  The clarity of the black-and-white films is outstanding, while the crispness of the movies in color is excellent.  Each movie has bonus features, including commentary by Jerry Lewis and Steve Lawrence, archival materials, and the theatrical trailer.  This budget collection makes for a nice companion piece, to go along with Jerry's masterpiece, ""The Nutty Professor"" (1963).",1418860800,23,2260,5.086956521739131

and strangely into duality and identity. You don't have to be French to enjoy delving
into these top comedies of their day. Lewis was the biggest comedy star in the
world when these were made. It didn't last long. But give these a view and compare
to what other comedies were out there at the time. Lewis was indeed a very progressive
filmmaker. Sure, you'll cringe in moments. But you'll be laughing a lot more.",1412640000,11,482,4.488636363636363
