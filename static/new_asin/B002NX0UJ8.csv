3960430,1,B002NX0UJ8,"By creating this show, MTV is sending a message to all teens out there that if you get pregnant there is a possibility that you will get to be on MTV.  This show does nothing to educate young people on the dangers of unprotected sex nor does it provide them with the tools to stand up to peer pressure.  MTV does a disservce to teens everywhere by giving (some) teenagers the idea that if they get pregnant there is a chance that they will get a show on MTV.  Unfortunate to say the least.",1267401600,7,489,4.180851063829787

And the answer is I will never feel happy anymore. But these girls showed us how they handle a bunch of craps when their boys leave them,how they try to be a responsible mom,and how they become better after this special experience.

3960440,5,B002NX0UJ8,I applaud Tyler and Catelynn for their courage and strength to do something I myself had to do 34 years ago... The differences in my situation was that I kept my son Johnny for the first 2 months of his life but knew deep down I was a failure as his mother... We were practically homeless with no help from his Ivy league college father... In Dec. 1980 I made the decision that I knew I had to make and called an adoption agency and back then all adoptions were closed meaning I knew nothing about the adoptive parents... I didn't have the option of choosing his new parents or watching him grow up like you can now... Shortly after his adoption was finalized I had a complete nervous breakdown and attempted suicide... It was only a few months later when I learned I had stage 1b cervical cancer and required a hysterectomy... I would never be able to have another child... I had the hysterectomy and wound up suffering severe complications but despite those complications I managed to follow my dream of becoming a Paramedic until 1995 when in the process of saving a heroin addicts life I was stuck by a needle belonging to the addict and he tested positive for Hepatitis C which I contracted... I am now in the advanced stages of my disease and will die soon from a combination of the complications from the cancer and the Hepatitis C... But watching Tyler and Catelynn as they struggled with their decision took me back to when I gave up my son... I have done nothing but cry writing this and watching the hell they went through but if by chance they see my story I want them to know that they did the right thing just as I did 34 years ago and they should be proud of themselves as we all loved our children enough to want more for them than what we could give them.... This picture is the only one I have of my son Johnny... I pray he had a happy life....,1429747200,11,1862,4.3076923076923075

This series is supposed to teach you on NOT to end up like this kids. It's really bad enough having children at around 30 years of age I could only imagine how really hard it would be at 16 years of age when you're not even finished at the high school level. What this series doesn't really show you is what happens to their children later in life if you're pregnant early: The CDC (Centers For Disease Control) confirmed that young single mothers are the main reasons why their children becomes the criminal elements of the future. Most likely their children ending up the future Car jackers bank robbers drug pushers drug dealers con artists swindlers drug smugglers and thugs. and not to mention that most of these young mothers become welfare mothers who will most likely will become drug addicted themselves & ending up in jail for child neglect, prostitution and drug overdose.

3960470,5,B002NX0UJ8,I chose this rating because it goes into the reality of teens having children too young.  I like the show because a lot of teenage girls think it's okay or a trend to have children. The reality is that it's hard and will change your life tremendously.  My dislike is most of the time the show seem to focus more on the dads not being there for the mother of their children or families at each other all the time. I would hope that any teenager or parent learn and understand the positive you can get from this show.  This is actually a teachable reality show and would definitely show how important it is to focus more on finishing high school and going to college. Basically waiting until your mature enough and older to become a parent.,1402272000,3,738,4.372262773722627

3960472,2,B002NX0UJ8,"First of all, I don't feel that the show is well directed...  it's pretty corny
But that is the least of why I don't care much for this show.  My sister had her first child at 16, and I saw all the heart ache, disadvantages, and hardship that it caused her.
I know they make these shows to make money and there is nothing saying that this was meant for educational purposes.  And while they do show some of what it's like to be a teen and pregnant, some of these episodes almost glamorize teen pregnancy and that's just wrong.  I guess I just don't morally agree with the majority of the content of these shows",1401926400,,610,4.232758620689655
3960473,4,B002NX0UJ8,"Good show for reinforcing life lessons your tween/teen might not yet take seriously. The show also reinforces some stereotypes, since most of the girls and their families are dysfunctional, mid to low income and obese, with a host of other issues. But within stereotypes are always a grain or two of truth. All the baby daddies are doofuses. The only kids that have their act together are the teen couple who give their kid up for adoption. It's hard to understand how happy some of the parents are that their little girls have ruined their lives. The only thing the show doesn't really address is that in many states a pregnant 16-year-old is proof positive of statutory rape.",1400112000,,677,4.745762711864407

3960478,1,B002NX0UJ8,"I would like this show better if it wasn't a ""reality"" show. The fact that these girls started off with good intentions (showing how difficult life can be being a teen mother) and it just turned into a cash cow show is sad. I feel sorry that they decided to have this part of their life filmed honestly because now (5 years later) most of these girls have mounds of cosmetic surgery, constantly pictured partying and are classified as ""celebrities"" on most gossip forums.

3960496,5,B002NX0UJ8,"I actually already reviewed 16 and Pregnant Season 2 so much of what I said in that review is relevant here.  Maci, who gets an apartment with her fiance Ryan, struggles to make a relationship work (dysfunctional) when there's the added stress of a baby; Farrah, a cheerleader, who realizes that her old life is basically dead now that she has a child; and Catelynn, a girl whom I greatly admire.  She's the only one, IMO, who realizes that it's about the baby as far as putting the baby first - can she provide for the child, give her anything she needs.  Catelynn and Tyler (her boyfriend), make a TOUGH decision to adopt the baby out and while it's so heartbreaking to watch (painful too), you know that the adoptive parents are going to be able to be the parents to this child that Catelynn and her boyfriend eventually want to be.  BTW, they're the only somewhat normal couple in the entire series.  There are more stories but I'll let the viewer see for herself/himself.",1362355200,,976,4.554285714285714

Frankly, I never thought I would change my feelings concerning Farrah, but after whatching 16 & Pregnant, Season 1, I am much more understanding of her.

I am really upset that this show has the opportunity to really educate young people and all it does is man bash. There is no one telling the young father how to be a dad or anyone for that matter telling Maci how to support the father of her child (not $ support but emotional) she is seen always taking care of Bentley but not encouraging Ryan.

With the crisis in our country of fatherless children... MTV you have the opportunity to encourage boys to become men. And i feel like you dropped the ball.

At the end I just wanted to have someone take Maci aside and say - Yes its hard for him too, just because you don't see it doesnt mean it doesnt happen and doesnt mean that he doesnt think about the awesome responsibility.  And have someone do the same for Ryan.",1340928000,,851,4.339622641509434

Now i can't stop buying the ""Follow up"" Teen Mom to see how these teens fared.  The show in no way promotes teen pregnancy...if anything people who have kids that want babies at a young age should probably make them watch the show!

3960506,5,B002NX0UJ8,"I love this series. It gives you a brilliant look into the lives of young women aged 16, when they first get pregnant. It shows the decisions of keeping a baby and parenting, giving the baby up for adopotion. It catches the hard decisions of what they have to do now, learning that they are still teenages, but are also now moms. I recommend it for anyone that is thinking of having children, even if you are older than 16. It shows the impacts of life change so much, and it is worth a deffiant watch.",1297900800,2,502,4.239583333333333
3960507,3,B002NX0UJ8,"The show is terrific. It sheds realism onto the difficult and controversial topic of teen pregnancy. Instead of irresponsibly trivializing the issue, ""16 and Pregnant"" focuses on the hard-core real-life drama of having a baby and raising it while still being a teenager. The episodes often have re-curring sub-topics, such as parental relationship to the pregnant teenager, finishing high school/earning a GED while pregnant, facing the intense demands of a screaming newborn, trying to keep your relationship going strong while coping with a child.....etcetera....the only downside to ordering the DVD, that you should expect ( I wish somebody had told me this before I ordered the DVD ) is not to see the episode ""Unseen Moments: Season One"". In the first season of ""16 and Pregnant"", we had six hour-long episodes sharing the stories of teen parents. After the last parent's episode, we had one episode that was the ""Reunion Special"" and we had the episode ""Unseen Moments: Season One"". ""Reunion Special"" IS included on the DVD, but the ""Unseen Moments: Season One"" episode is not. Kind of a drag, since technically it IS part of the first season. There are also no English subtitles, so some of the dialogue is difficult to understand.

As for a summary of the stories in Season One, here is a brief synopsis:

Episode #1: ""Maci"". Maci is an overachieving teen whose life heads in a whole new direction after she gets pregnant. Her fiancee, Ryan, is very immature and Maci is not sure if she can depend on him or not.

Episode #2: ""Farrah"". Farrah is a pregnant teen who risks losing her friends due to her pregnancy. She also has issues getting along with her parents and finding the right place for herself emotionally.

Episode #3: ""Amber"": Amber is an expectant teen who drops out of high school and moves in with her older boyfriend, Gary. The pregnancy and the animosity between themselves and their families threatens to destroy their relationship.

Episode #4: ""Ebony"": Ebony is a teen mom-to-be who is trying to maintain her high goals, along with her impending motherhood. She and her slacker fiancee, Josh, try to deal with making sacrifices in order to make their family work.

Episode #5: ""Whitney"": Whitney is a childish yet likable pregnant teen who is trying improve her living situation with her boyfriend, Weston, her mother ( who is also pregnant ), her mother's boyfriend, and her grandmother.

Episode #6: ""Catelynn"": Catelynn is an expectant teen from the wrong side of the tracks. She is fortunately in a good relationship with her boyfriend Tyler, but the couple faces the toughest decision of their lives-adoption-without their families' support.

Tough stuff. Emotional.

The ""Reunion Special"" episode is on the special features disc. It is a Q&A forum with the teen mothers and a live audience. It is very interesting and Dr. Drew Pinsky does a very good job of neutrally hosting it.

I would recommend this show to teen moms, young moms, or even anybody who knows a teen mom or a young mom. If I had watched this show as a teenager, I would have looked at it from a teenager's point of view, and the parents' opinions in the show probably would have annoyed me. But now I am an adult, and I can see both sides-the parents' points-of-view, and also the angst-ridden points-of-view from the teenage moms and their boyfriends.

Very good show. Just wish the DVD was better :-(",1278720000,12,3405,4.873702422145329
3960508,5,B002NX0UJ8,"I love how this show lets young teen moms know that they're not alone. Abortion isn't your only option, and even though it seems over whelming, raising a baby or making the tough choice to put your baby up for adoption like Caitlin ( My favorite mom!!!) is possible. This is a great show, and anyone who says that MTV is promoting teen pregnancy is naive. Its already out there, happening all over the world, and this show helps those moms, and also reminds other young woman to be more careful and use protection.",1270425600,,514,4.4787234042553195
3960509,5,B002NX0UJ8,"I have to admit part of me fears that some silly kids wanting to get on tv, MTV in particular, will view getting pregnant as a fairly ""easy"" way to get on tv compared to auditioning for shows like The Real World, etc... However, I truly believe that the majority of teens wouldn't purposely get pregnant even if it meant getting on television.  And with that fear set aside, I have to say this is a remarkable show.  It doesn't paint teen pregnancy as this carefree easy endeavor.  It seems like literally every episode the girls are crying because the fathers of their babies don't help/want to take part either during the pregnancy itself or after, and most split up.  You see the girls crying over lack of sleep and the efforts behind feeding (at all hours of the day and night) their babies, bathing them, changing their diapers, etc...  Add to that the struggles to either get back into school or to finish up school and actually graduate, I have to say, this show is showing the harsh reality that being a teen parent or a teen mom in particular, is a tremendous responsibility and that your life is forever altered.  Mtv does keep sending the message that there are ways to prevent teen pregnancy, either during their commercial breaks or from the girls themselves or their friends and family.  And based on my viewing experience, I can say all of the girls admit that having sex has consequences, namely the chance of getting pregnant, and that while they might not ""regret"" having their children because they of course love them, that they'd like to have put off having them for a little longer until they finished school.  I really respect MTV for this show compared to a lot of their silly shows with people just debasing themselves and looking like idiots.  This show has a place and a purpose, because despite what parents might think, simply talking to your children often isn't enough.  Sometimes you need to see to believe and to fade any fantasies about the perfect little family some of these kids might think they'll have if they do become pregnant.  While the show isn't perfect, I think it's important and I do think it might be a better way to encourage kids to use protection, not simply because it's showing peers dealing with pregnancy, but it's showing girls viewers can relate to and empathize with.  They've featured so many different girls that there's someone for every viewer to relate to who they see themselves in.  Not to keep going on but when MTV airs all these salacious shows with carefree sex it's nice to have the juxtaposition with a show that illustrates that there's no such thing as carefree sex.  On that note I'm definitely buying both seasons. Lol.",1269388800,,2695,4.658227848101266
