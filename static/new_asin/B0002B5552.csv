8182162,5,B0002B5552,"Diane Ramirez takes Pilates to an entirely new level. If you have made it through workouts by Karen Voight and Jennifer Kries, you are ready for Diane Ramirez. She has created one of the most challenging Pilates workouts I've ever tried and she increases the intensity by using a ball and exercise band.

This program replicates the exercises performed on a Pilates Reformer Machine. Melissa Rivera joins Diane at the beach for an inspiring workout in the sun.

Throughout the exercises, Diane gives careful instruction and explains the placement of the ball and exercise band. Roll-ups become even more challenging while holding more weight and having a ball and exercise band to work with helps you to concentrate on the moves in a more intense way.

Recommended for Intermediate and Advanced Pilates enthusiasts. If you have a small soccer ball or any weighted ball and an exercise band, that is all you really need for this workout.

Diane Ramirez impressed me with her caring and precise instruction style. She also has a pleasant voice and a inner joy that speaks of peace and years of healing choices.

I felt invigorated and energized after completing this workout. The boats sailing by in the background also created an environment that made me feel like I was on a vacation. This workout was filmed on location in San Diego, CA.
