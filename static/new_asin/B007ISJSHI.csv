Highly Recommend plus DVD's are very well made/filmed,1373068800,,273,4.708333333333333
5089728,5,B007ISJSHI,"The legends and tales of feats of immortalized frontiersmen of the Wild western frontiers are told in this collection.

5089732,3,B007ISJSHI,One of the dvd's is good historical information.  The other one sounds as if someone is reading the information out loud to someone while showing still pictures.,1356912000,,161,4.962962962962963
5089733,4,B007ISJSHI,"This is a great idea by Mill Creek entertainment, putting these two Documentary Series together on one DVD Set. On this Set you'll find the following series: OUTLAWS AND GUNSLINGERS and AMERICAN HISTORY OF THE WILD WEST. This 3-Disc Set contains over 14 Hours of documentaries about the Old West, Outlaws and the history of the American Wild West. If, like me, you are a history buff and you really enjoy watching Historical documentaries then this collection will be a good addition to your library.

Documentary 1: OUTLAWS AND GUNSLINGERS ( 1 DVD, 3 Hours, 5 Episodes )
This is by far one of the best documentary series that Mill Creek Entertainment has ever produced. Over the years they produced some amazing documentaries ( America's 60 Greatest Unsolved Mysteries and Crimes, Vegas: The City the Mob made ), and OUTLAWS & GUNSLINGERS is one of them. Produced by award-winning production company Centre Communications, this series serves as a follow-up to their smash hit ""The Great Indian Wars 1540 - 1890"". This is the story of the West as it has never been told before...Myth and legend stripped away and the truth revealed by 17 of the nation's top Western authorities. Learn the truth about Billy The Kid, Jesse James, Wild Bill Hickok and many more. I'm a History buff, I just really enjoy watching documentaries about History, other eras, other times. To me it's a passion. Recently I discovered that I have a huge interest for the Wild West, stories of Cowboys and Outlaws, Billy the Kid, Jesse James and his gang. Fascinating stuff. Very fascinating. I bought this DVD last week, and I wasn't disappointed by it. Everything about this documentary series is great. The amount of information given to us is impressing, I've learned a lot while watching these 5 episodes. So many fascinating events or characters are covered: Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Bill Hickok, Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, how the Wild West begun, the evolution of guns and firearms, the gunfight at OK Corral, towns like Tombstone and Deadwood, the origin of the lawmen, The Civil War, Samuel Colt, John Coffee Hays, Samuel Hamilton Walker, history of the Texas Rangers, The Guerillas, William Quantrill, Allen Pinkerton, Boomtowns, and so much more. Very impressive list.

1. ORIGINS OF THE GUNSLINGER ( 31 minutes )
2. JESSE JAMES & THE SOUTHERN GUERILLAS ( 38 minutes )
3. BILLY THE KID & THE LONE OUTLAWS ( 41 minutes )
4. WILD BILL HICKOK & THE LAWMEN ( 38 minutes )
5. WYATT EARP & THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL ( 38 minutes )

Documentary 2: AMERICAN HISTORY OF THE WILD WEST ( 2 DVD, 11 Hours, 12 Episodes )
Be transported into the wild and wooly past of the American Wild West! In this fascinating 12 documentary collection, you'll find history, lore and biographies of the lives and times of those who populated the Wild West. The American West featured all sorts of legendary historical figures from pioneers and scouts to lawmen, outlaws, gangs and gunslingers, to the American cowboy, and pioneering women on the frontier. I like this DVD set. I agree, it's far from being perfect, but I like it. I like watching old documentaries, learning more about the past, learning more about History. What I like about this set is that it covers a lot of subject you don't usually find on DVD. From legendary outlaws to the great Indian wars, this DVD is full of interesting and fascinating information about America's past and the Wild West. The narrator is a little boring, and sometimes the information is repetitive, but overall it's gonna be a good addition to your collection. The price of this set is great (I got it for only 5$),and like I said earlier the amount of information given to us is impressive, so I don't regret this buy. If, like me, you're interested in History and the Wild West then buy this set, you won't regret it.

8517797,5,B007ISJSHI,"You can't really write a true product review because it's a bundled package, we are talking about 2 entirely different lines of thought here, one is focused on Outlaws and Gunslingers and other on the Wild West culture,  so to review one you also have to review the other and that's why you see so many mixed reviews here, from my standpoint,  most people are going to like the Outlaws and Gunslingers and dislike the black and white documentary like Wild West feature, because it's narrator believe me you, is dry and stale and hardly anything like the enthusiastic David Attenborough,  but then again how many David Attenborough are there?  Sadly there was only one but not anymore.  RIP Sir David Attenborough.",1518912000,,713,4.811475409836065

the narrator sounds like he has had 1 glass of scotch too many and the script he is reading sounds like a group of literature students wrote it. the 2nd part outlaws and gunslingers however is well done and very interesting. if you can buy this separately, do so. no way I could recommend this.",1398470400,,439,4.365853658536586
