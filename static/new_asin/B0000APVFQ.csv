7997799,5,B0000APVFQ,"Strange things are happening in the Ofun countryside, but with Louie's haphazard approach to being a champion and a wizard, ordinary life is too much of a challenge to his fellow adventurers for them to notice the evidence of political machinations.  So it's not surprising that, while blundering into a secret army and discovering a hidden lab where monsters are being manufactured, they never put two and two together.
Instead, to the viewer's constant delight, they barely make their escapes only to have to rescue Merrill from marriage and recover Melissa's bathing suit from a monster with either a very hungry or very dirty mind.  It that's not enough Genie and Louie get into a major fistfight and wind up... well, not quite buddies.
This series arrived here with very little fanfare, despite a strong standard of artwork and writing.  While this is at least partially a slapstick slash-and-dasher, little bits keep popping up that make it obvious that some intelligence has gone into the production and direction.  Like Saiyuki, another series that reworks the stereotypes of the adventuring team, these characters have more depth than expected.
If there is a plot, and there are no guarantees, it is being allowed to develop at its own pace.  And I honestly am beginning to hope that the story remains episodic and light-hearted.  There isn't enough of that in anime for that 15 through adult date range that also exhibits the maturity needed to engage the watcher.
While it would be helpful to see the series so far in order, it doesn't seem to have become necessary yet.  By all means look it up if you like the fantasy/RPG genre - I think you will find it worth pursuing.",1065225600,6,1683,4.843205574912892
