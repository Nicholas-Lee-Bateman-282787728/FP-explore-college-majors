My daughter watches it, likes it, and actually recognizes the words.  REALLY!  I like this item.  And now that I am writing this overdue review, I think I will check and see if there are other volumes and get a few more.  Highly recommend for the little ones that are not reading yet, but can recognize letters.",1336003200,,433,4.219512195121951
8068452,1,B0009WIY2U,This looks like someone made it on their home computer.  The words displayed are pixelated like an over cropped photo.  It looks like a wedding video from the 80's.  The story line is uninspired to say the least and the words are displayed a phrase at a time rather than word for word.  Don't waste your money.  Check out Readeez or Scholastic DVDs,1313193600,,348,4.4603174603174605
8068453,5,B0009WIY2U,"This is such an obvious idea that it is a shame there aren't more videos like it out there,but there are not.  I have looked and looked. My two grandsons, aged two and three, love the stories.  I watch the video with them, and for now, I read the parts meant for the child to read himself. Later, I am sure they will learn to do it alone. In many ways it is just like reading on a one to one basis.  Why buy a video then?  The large screen is very appealing. This would be wonderful for any child dealing with English as a second language. There are sections in which children read stories they have written and illustrated about the theme of each story.  My grandsons love those parts and seem interested in drawing their own pictures.  I am a former teacher, having spent twenty years teaching reading. I would definitely recommend this video.  I wish this company success and hope to see more like it.",1234483200,2,904,4.345238095238095
8068454,2,B0009WIY2U,I know this got great reviews but I found it to be sort of budget looking or in other words with cheep filming.  My dtr. was not attracted to it at all. Sorry :-(,1185926400,,162,3.764705882352941
8068455,5,B0009WIY2U,Awesome video that actually helps a child learn how to read. As mentioned by others it's very interactive and provides an opportunity for a child to re-tell the story he was read. We can't wait for a second volume to be released.,1179792000,,229,4.476190476190476
8068456,4,B0009WIY2U,"Fabulous! Accessible stories that engage instead of pander. Simple, colourful scenes that children can relate to and enjoy, with animated words that reinforce meaning. I love the down-to-earth feel of these videos. Kids these days are bombarded with deafening volumes and over-the-top special effects (even Winnie-the-Pooh has been reinvented with psychedelic CGI and scary story lines), yet children thrive on gentle stories with strong, comforting storylines. Big dog; splashing stones with Grandpa; muffin-making with Mum -- all gently captivating. I was particularly interested to see my 5-year-old step-grandson (who is autistic and generally not attracted to video images) fascinated by the colour segment; he watched the whole thing, repeating the names of the colours.",1144886400,5,776,5.815789473684211
8068457,5,B0009WIY2U,"I hope that there is a volume two available soon. I purchased the Leap Frog DVD entitled ""Learn to Read at The Storybook Inn"" and I prefer Read-TV.  I think that it is one that children can really relate to and my son just loves it. The real life children and events are much better than animation in my opinion.  The words are captivating and easy to read on the screen.  I am very impressed and will look forward to more products from Tremain.",1130371200,,445,4.273809523809524
8068458,5,B0009WIY2U,"I think its great that the video has stories with real children - we live in an animated world so this is such a refreshing change - and the kids love it. The kids in the video are being kids and having fun - doing what kids do best. I gave this video to my friend's children and one mom said that she's never had her two year old watch a video in its entire length until Read-TV. I watch the kids interact with Read-TV; they laughed, they said the words during the interactive part and the kids refer to it throughout the day so its staying with them as a learning tool. It captures kids attention. I love the bouncy words. It's an eductional tool for kids of all ages and parents will love it too.",1121126400,8,699,4.109489051094891
8068459,5,B0009WIY2U,"WOW - this is a definite purchase for anyone who  has young children.  My children,  who are one and four love to watch the other children  learning and exploring on the video.  They are not only hearing the words but seeing them in print and specific movement across the screen.  I noticed that the creator of this fantastic video is a mother herself, which reinforces the learning opportunities, as she knows what interests children and captivates their attention.  I also think that this would be very appropriate in the school setting for primary aged children.  Being a teacher myself I see how television can be used in an educational setting and why not use a learning opportunity like this, instead of a cartoon where no specific learning may occur.  Children are captivated by television, and this video provides entertainment as well as education!  I would defintely recommend this video for all children!",1120780800,6,915,4.9605263157894735
8068460,5,B0009WIY2U,"I work with children of the age 0-6 years teaching literacy

I work with children who may have barriers and be at a low literacy level

I am thrilled to see educational videos on early literacy

This video or dvd is colorfull and fun

The events are nurturing and humorous about everyday children and life activities

My favorite thing about Read TV is the calming environment and appealing tones of all the characters

This is very important for children who may have fasd / fase

The pace and transition of the stories very well planned

Every child will love Read TV and be able to identify with

simple childhood pleasures

I have it in my collection and I love it so much that

we presented a video to our community ROOTS OF EMPATHY BABIES this year who pioneered the program in our schools for the first time

READ TV captures the connection of milestones , meaning and language development for early childhood development

Yeah!!!! I look forward to more",1119571200,6,961,4.615384615384615
