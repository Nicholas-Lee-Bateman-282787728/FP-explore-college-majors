8338901,4,B001RUBAGU,"My favorite Jinx Media movie, Hellbride is a RomCom / Splatter mashup with the tiniest budget and the largest heart.  The script is sharp and smart, the physical effects are well done, and there are moments of true creepiness.  If you are looking for CGI jump scares you are in the wrong place, but those with an open mind may discover a hidden gem in this micro-budget horror effort.",1470009600,,384,4.550724637681159
