2065353,2,B00027JY8U,"Pairing Elvis Presley with Nancy Sinatra may have sounded good on paper, but there is no chemistry on celluloid. In all fairness, not even Ann-Margret could have redeemed ""Speedway."" There are a few good songs (especially Elvis' classic ""Let Yourself Go"") and the stock-car footage is fairly enjoyable. Otherwise, strictly Formula One. Released in June 1968, ""Speedway"" gave little indication of the triumphant Presley comeback just around the corner.",937180800,2,451,5.550724637681159

This picture is a joy to watch from beginning to end.  I especially love when Elvis and Nancy when they are all dressed up in white.

2065391,4,B00027JY8U,"I saw ""Speedway"" on TV when I was about 10 years old, so I had only vague memories of the movie when a couple of months ago I read about it in the 2009 book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-Presley-in-the-Movies-with-DVD/dp/1435118553/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis Presley in the Movies with DVD</a>&nbsp;by Timothy Knight. Since Knight made glowing comments about the film such as: ""for Presley, 'Speedway' was the cinematic equivalent of a breath of fresh air; he comes across as energized and engaged by his role and seems to be enjoying himself immensely on-screen,"" I ordered the DVD from Amazon and eagerly watched it when it came in. I was pleasantly surprised, especially compared to his other late-60s movies, most of which are disappointing. ""Speedway"" has better than average music, a well-written and funny script, and a revitalized Elvis. Some reviewers on Amazon state that this is just another ""formula"" Elvis movie, but ""Speedway"" is a heck of a lot better than most of his musical comedies. For one thing, there's a decent story-line based on Elvis's character having financial problems, partly caused by his generosity in helping others. This generosity imparts a humane aspect to the film that elevates it, and it reflected Elvis's real life. Also, Elvis and love interest Nancy Sinatra have quite good chemistry together, although they don't light up the screen like Elvis and Ann-Margret did in ""Viva Las Vegas."" The good photography on the film is thanks to cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg, who had won 4 Best Cinematography Oscars and been nominated 6 more times. There are also other nice touches, such as Elvis only coming in THIRD place in the final car race!

I mentioned that the music in ""Speedway"" is better than the average of Elvis's musical comedies, but just as important, it's staged a lot better too, including very good choreography for the songs sung in the groovy, late '60s looking Hangout club. Even the IRS-themed song, ""He's Your Uncle, Not Your Dad,"" is a good tune that's given clever choreography in an IRS office, about which film historian Stuart Galbraith made the apt observation that it recalls ""MGM's '50s musicals more than a late-'60s Elvis one."" (That quote is from Knight's book.) Elvis's other late '60s films were not creative enough to come up with something like that. The other songs in the film are ""Speedway,"" ""Who Are You?"", ""Your Groovy Self"" (sung by Nancy Sinatra), ""There Ain't Nothing Like a Song,"" (duet with Elvis and Nancy Sinatra), ""Let Yourself Go,"" and ""Your Time Hasn't Come Yet, Baby."" Those last 2 were flip sides of a 45 single released in 1968. (Some of this data is courtesy the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-His-Life-from-A-to-Z/dp/0517066343/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis: His Life from A to Z</a>&nbsp;by Fred L. Worth and Steve Tamerius.)

I also much appreciated that the film has been remastered and restored, since it now looks wonderful in widescreen on the DVD (probably 1.85:1). The movie can be heard in either English or French, with optional subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Bakasa Indonesian, and several Asian languages! The good sounding audio has no options, so I guess is not available in surround sound. The only bonus feature on the disc is 4 trailers from the Elvis movies ""Speedway,"" ""Double Trouble,"" ""Spinout,"" and ""The Trouble With Girls."" Now, ""Speedway"" is not a great classic like ""Casablanca"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but if you like Elvis's musical comedies at all I think you'll enjoy ""Speedway"" as much as I do.",1326585600,2,3657,5.347222222222222
2065392,3,B00027JY8U,"Elvis Presley plays a race car driver who finds himself in hot water with the IRS in Speedway (1968).  Like many of Presley's films, the story is lightweight and kind of silly, but scenes shot at a real race track featuring some well-known stock car drivers helps to spice things up.  There are also a couple of big rousing production numbers, and of course a number of pretty girls.  The supporting cast is strong, as Presley is teamed with Bill Bixby (My Favorite Martian, The Incredible Hulk), and singer Nancy Sinatra is his love interest.

Stock car driver Steve Grayson (Presley) is on a winning streak, however due to his manager Kenny Donford (Bixby) mishandling his finances, Grayson finds that he owes Uncle Sam a huge sum in back taxes.  Susan Jacks (Sinatra) is an IRS field agent assigned to Grayson's case, and together with her boss R.W. Hepworth (Gale Gordon), they come up with a plan whereby Grayson can begin to pay off his obligations.

Being a generous guy, while he thought that he was in good financial shape, Steve had helped out a number of his friends, including Abel Esterlake (William Schallert), a single father who is raising five little girls, who now have no place to stay.  In need of some quick cash to help his friends, Steve convinces the IRS to go along with his scheme to try and raise some dough.  Now all Steve needs to do is win the next race.

The tax angle and racing elements, add a little more substance and excitement this comedic adventure.  Bill Bixby is a real skirt chaser here, but his inherent charm still comes through, and he works very well with Elvis.  Acting doesn't seem to be Nancy Sinatra's strength, but she gets by, and has a featured musical number.  With a long history playing a tightfisted banker on The Lucy Show, Gale Gordon is an easy fit as an IRS supervisor.  Carl Ballantine (McHale's Navy), provides some laughs as Steve's chief mechanic Birdie Kebner.  Beverly Powers plays Mary Ann Ashman, Miss Charlotte Speedway 100, who spends time with both Presley and Bixby.

If you enjoy Elvis' musical comedies, this is a recommended watch.  While not spectacular, the cast is solid, there are some decent songs, and the race track setting is utilized fairly well.",1322092800,4,2230,4.708762886597938
2065393,4,B00027JY8U,"We usually expect things to get worse towards the end of a career, in this case Elvis' Hollywood career. But after a low during 1965-67 things were actually getting better again for Elvis the actor. The fact that his later films didn't get much (if any) attention compared to his earlier musicals is mainly because people by then expected them to be bad in advance. So they got featured with movies like ""The Green Slime"", which actually didn't make them any more attractive as one can imagine. Still, films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-a-Little-Love-a-Little/dp/B000QXDEFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live a Little, Love a Little</a>, the underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trouble-with-Girls/dp/B000QXDEFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trouble with Girls</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Change-of-Habit/dp/B00006674X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Change of Habit</a>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stay-Away-Joe/dp/B000R3PDJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stay Away, Joe</a>&nbsp;are in fact pretty enjoyable.

So is ""Speedway"". Being the last of the classical sub-genre ""Elvis movie"" it brings an era to its end. Cast by MGM as a race car driver for the third time in four years, Elvis doesn't re-invent the genre. HIs movies never had the influence on Hollywood like his recordings had on rock and pop music history. But although this movie is far from being a towering moment in film making it still succeeds in a very worthy way.

The script is tight for an Elvis movie with some nice one-liners and strong dialogues. Director Norman Taurog truly makes the best out of it in his second to last movie ever (the last one being ""Live a Little""). The pace of ""Speedway"" is as tight as the photography of some late 1960ies stock car races, featuring some popular drivers of the time. The soundtrack is pretty good, too, with ""Let Yourself Go"" being so strong that it was included in Elvis' famous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-The-68-Comeback-Special/dp/B000G7PO6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis: The '68 Comeback Special</a>.

But what REALLY makes this movie work is the supporting cast with Bill Bixby being Elvis' best male co-star, second to arguably only Gary Lockwood ( ""2001 - A Space Odyssey) from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Happened-at-the-World-s-Fair/dp/B000QXDEEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Happened at the World's Fair</a>&nbsp;(1963). They have a great chemistry and their comedy timing is simply perfect. Noteworthy are also Gale Gordon, William Schallert and Carl Ballantine. Nancy Sinatra isn't as good and convincing as Ann Margret was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viva-Las-Vegas-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B000QUUD56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viva Las Vegas (Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;four years before. She doesn't really add much to the movie but at least she doesn't get in the way. ^^ She remains the only artist to have a song of her own on an Elvis soundtrack album, though.

""Speedway"" is fun to watch with its late 1960ies looks and some fine gimmicks such as the ""Hang Out"" that inspired Quentin Tarantino's ""Jack Rabbit Slim's"" from ""Pulp Fiction"". If you're looking for an Elvis movie to watch this is definitely a recommendation. I'm almost sure you'll like it. At least there worse ways to spend 90 minutes on, say, a rainy Sunday afternoon.

2065397,4,B00027JY8U,"I give Elvis a thumbs up on this one. ""Speedway"" is entertaining, perhaps not his best film, but definitely worth watching. Elvis was in his prime (physically) for this entry.

But mainly, I dropped in here to let folks know that there's a movie (a pretty awful one) about Tiny Lund, who co-starred in ""Speedway,"" and who was a REAL racecar driver. Tiny, a huge and endearing fellow, won the Daytona 500 in 1963. It's called ""Tiny Lund: Hard Charger!"" If you're a drooling NASCAR fan you might want to see it, although it's hard to find.

In any case, that's my two-cent's worth.",1202169600,,579,4.5576923076923075
2065398,2,B00027JY8U,"By 1968, Elvis was wishing his film contact was over.  None of his movies could really be said to have high artistic value, although his pre-army movies like Jail-House Rock had some artistic merit, and in them he showed that when he was interested in a project, he had some not bad acting ability.

His post-army films (except King Creole) were more geared toward slick entertainment, exploiting his name and image, and they were very formulaic -- BUT, his early '60's movies were also very entertaining.  Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, Fun in Acapulco and GI Blues are always fun to watch, and pretty hip time capsules of pop culture in the early '60's.

Unfortunately, after about 1965, the quality of his movies took a downturn, as even he himself would say, and he began to really look bored with the whole thing in the last 3 or 4 years of his Hollywood era.  The films had always been easy-going fluff, but likable.  His early 60's movies had peppy songs, and were very much in touch with pop-culture of the time.  By 1968, however, when Speedway was made, his image was no longer up-to-date, about 4 or 5 years out of style, as if the rest of the world had moved on, but Elvis was still stuck in 1963.

But still, Speedway is probably the best movie from the last 3 years of his movie making career.  It's the third time he has played a race car driver, and this time they use actual footage of real NASCAR races.  In fact, this film has some of the best existing footage of Charlotte Speedway and live NASCAR action from the mid-60's, with Richard Petty and Cale Yarbrough ontrack and in their prime during the race scenes (too bad they didn't make any cameos in the body of the film).  So for NASCAR fans, this movie has historical value.

Nancy Sinatra, of the Go-Go Boots fame, could have been the sexiest co-star ever in an Elvis movies (or at least she could have tied with Ann-Margret), but the script doesn't give her much on-screen time, and there is only one scene with her wearing those trademark boots - at the very end of the movie.

One bit of irony is the theme of Elvis' character being a celebrity whose manager is cheating himout of some of his earnings, which is sadly what happened to Elvis in real life for much of his career.

Overall, though, mediocre Elvis is still more entertaining than alot of topnotch actors who specialize in long boring movies, and every Elvis fan should see this one at least once.",1187222400,16,2435,4.492063492063492

Bill Bixby you guys!! he is great in this movie as Elvis's manager and he is funny from start to finish and his chemistry with Elvis is the best i've seen from an Elvis movie (Ever) not overestimating.
""Your time hasen't come yet baby"" is great and ""let yourself go"" is very cool and Elvis is enjoying himself as if he knows he's making cool look good again since pappa sinatra.

2065401,5,B00027JY8U,"OK, people, we are talking 1968 here.  Granted, this movie isn't War and Peace, but was never intended to be.  Elvis, by the time this movie was filmed, knew there was no chance of being considered a serious actor, although that was his dream.
The chemistry between Elvis and Nancy Sinatra is very evident...on and off the screne.  Great friends and they had a blast making this movie.  I recall Nancy saying they would ride around the MGM lot on a bicycle built for two when tour buses would come around and the heads would turn.  That sounds like an enjoyable experience to me.  The film is enjoyable, funny, and for its time, the racing scenes are action packed.
It doesn't get any better than Nancy singing ""Your Groovy Self"" with the blonde hair, [lightened around her face more for the movie] and those smokey, almond eyes.  WOW!
BTW, Nancy was the only performer to have a solo song included on a Presley album.  Impressive and enjoyable.
