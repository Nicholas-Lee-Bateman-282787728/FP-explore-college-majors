8099827,4,B000CNEENO,"I am sure that the title of this workout is likely to put a lot of people off, as the workout might simply be dismissed as something overly quirky or new-agey.  In truth, however, the Zodiac Workout offers an interesting blend of stretching, yoga, core work, and free-form dance movements.  The ""zodiac"" part of the title comes from the idea that the different astrological signs apparently correspond to different parts of the body, and so the warm-ups and dances designed for each particular sign simply reflect this.  The creator of this DVD is Sherene Shostak, who presumably provides the female voiceover narration, but the moves are demonstrated on screen by ballet dancer Ashley Maher.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following selections:  User Guide-Let's Warmup-The Zodiac Dance-Your Warmup Sign-Your Dance Sign-Zodiac Body-Audio Setup.  The Audio Setup offers an option that I've never seen on a fitness DVD before, which is a choice of female or male narration.  With respect to the other menu items, you can choose to do the entire Warmup or Dance segments of the workout, or you can select certain signs only by going directly to that menu feature.  Zodiac Body is a chart which provides further descriptions of how each sign influences different areas of the body.  Finally, the DVD comes with a detailed booklet insert which provides even more information on the individual signs and how to work with these during the dance segments of the workout.

The Warmup is approximately 40 minutes long, and it is more appropriately described as a stretching/core workout.  Beginning with Aries, the first several signs concentrate largely on loosening the upper body.  I was particularly interested to see that the exercises for my own sign, Taurus, included shoulder shrugs and shoulder circles, as my shoulders/upper back tends to be my tightest area.  You continue moving through the signs in the standing segment in this manner, spending about 2-3 minutes per sign.  Scorpio includes several recognizable yoga postures such as tree, eagle, camel, and down dog.  At this point, however, you actually return to two of the previous signs, Leo and Virgo, for a lengthier (10 minutes) floor segment (note: I don't believe that this segment can be accessed off the main menu like the others).  This section, which is a bit more challenging, focuses more on working the core via moves that have a Pilates-like feel to them.  At one point, the voiceover states that you will be moving into the ""leg work,"" but really, you are simply continuing to work your core by using leg moves such as frog legs.  The Warmup series returns to standing for the final few signs; Aquarius actually includes some brief jumping, and then Pisces brings the segment to a quiet close.

The Zodiac Dance is 20 minutes long; each dance flows into the next, with the dance for each individual sign lasting 1.5-2 minutes.  The opening instructions suggest that you use what is shown on-screen as a guide but that you follow your own interpretation.  As mentioned above, there are also additional suggestions for the dance segment based on each sign in the included booklet.  Again starting with Aries, the dance is a bit more active and aggressive, including punches and optional kicks.  The dance slows down with Taurus, becoming grounded and more sensual.  The dances continue in this manner, often varying between being more quick and dramatic (Gemini, Leo) to being more gentle or dreamy (Cancer, Pisces).  There is no cool-down or final stretch to bring the dance segment to a close.  By putting a lot of effort into the dances, I was able to be in my target heart rate zone for 15 minutes.

I did find it interesting to try this workout.  It reminded me of other workouts that I like and enjoy--for example, the opening stretching reminded me of Classical Stretch, and the dance portion reminded me of Ravi Singh and Ana Brett's Dance the Chakras.  However, I think that those other workouts better meet my needs than this one, so I'm not sure if the Zodiac Workout will find a permanent home in my workout collection.  Still, there are definitely some things to like about this workout, and I could see it being a good fit for the right user.",1242604800,7,4233,4.87972027972028
8099828,5,B000CNEENO,"The ""zodiac"" in this workout is about two minutes of warming up with each sign, then two minutes of working out to each sign.  You can do all warmups/workouts at once for a roughly hour-long workout, or do just the workouts for an approximately 30-minute workout.  As each sign is introduced, a voiceover tells you the type of moves ""appropriate"" for that sign, but encourages you to make up your own moves.  After the initial intro, you can follow the on-screen dancer or make the moves your own.  The music is some of the most enjoyable I have heard (mid-eastern drums for the faster dances, water sounds and bells for some of the more fluid movements.)

Aries is aggressive, and moves might be ""punching movements or whatever makes you feel like a warrior.""  Cancer is nurturing, and your moves might be ""fluid and gentle.""  Leo is strong and creative; your moves might by dramatic.  Throughout the workout, you are encouraged to ""let your dance express any emotion you are feeling.""  I found this structure-free workout to be different from the norm ... and rather enjoyable.",1196467200,5,1079,4.789189189189189

8099830,5,B000CNEENO,"totally fresh! i love astrology and i needed to get in shape--- and this DVD has the best of all possible worlds. it makes you want to move--unlike most workouts that get old fast, this one lets you make up your own workout based on whichever zodiac sign you want to work with. some days i want to do a fiery aries or leo workout routine and some days i want to be slow and mellow like taurus. Its a really cool mix of yoga, ballet, pilates and belly dance. and i seriously lost the chub on my belly and thighs within only two weeks of doing half of this workout DVD! yay! thanks for making this awesome DVD!",1144454400,6,608,4.117647058823529
