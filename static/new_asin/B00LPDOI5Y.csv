6498278,5,B00LPDOI5Y,"Bought it for my mother on her birthday. She is a sci-fi/ rubber monster movie geek.. I think she really enjoys it. seeing she would be scared to walk home from the theaters after watching one of these movies. Scared. It is amazing the technology put in to cleaning up these films for Blu-ray. I almost don't believe they were made so long ago. very clear, nice sound. we would watch them together. hope you enjoy them to.",1425340800,2,422,4.423076923076923

6498283,5,B00LPDOI5Y,"I had previously owned the U.S. version of the Universal Monsters collection on blu-ray.  When I saw this set offered on amazon.uk, I knew that I had to have it.  I sold my U.S. version, and eagerly awaited the arrival of the coffin.  What I wasn't sure of was what the insides of this collection would look like.  When it finally arrived, I couldn't wait to see what was in the brown box.  I quickly sat down and started to cut the security tape.  I pulled out the packaging, and there it was.  The gorgeous coffin containing the classic monster films.  After examining the artwork on the lid and the base, I carefully removed the lid.  It was a little tight, I think because it had rained the day it arrived, and the moisture in the air probably caused a little expansion.  I had wondered what kind of holder would be inside, and I was about to find out.  As it turns out, if you've seen the non-limited UK edition with the blue dripping down the top of the box, that's what's inside the box.  While I did like the book format of the disc holders in the US version, I have to say that I really like this better.  The discs are securely held in two-disc stacked plastic hubs that gatefold out with four movies on each side.  Now for the big surprise for me.  Also included in the box is a nice book detailing each film, and some really nice movie poster cards for each film.  What's on the discs inside seems to be identical to the US version.  If I had to find a negative for this wonderful set, it would be that the menus on the discs are not that good. It's not clear what each symbol stands for, outside of the play symbol, until you click on it.  While that is a minor quibble, I'm not sure why Universal chose to use such a simplistic menu style.  If you're thinking that this set looks really big online, that's what I was thinking.  I really didn't want a gigantic coffin to add to my collection.  Well, as it turns out, it's about the same height and depth of a regular blu ray box set.  If you don't already own this fantastic set, then this is definitely the version you want to get.  If you do already own the previously released US version, you may want to do what I did.  Sell my old set on Amazon, and then order this fantastic set.  When I ordered it, the UK website did offer the set at a lower price.  It was about $85 once you add s & h to it.",1413158400,41,2363,4.161147902869757
6498314,5,B00LPDOI5Y,This set is excellent! So glad I opted for this version.,1470700800,,56,4.181818181818182

6498317,4,B00LPDOI5Y,"This is the same blu ray UK version you can buy with out the coffin for $10 less. It comes with the same contents, the only difference is the coffin. I thought it might come with some extra stuff but paying $10 more to get a cardboard coffin that takes up more room is what I did not have in mind. The coffin version is cheaper than the US version and the movies play well, but I already had most of the movies on regular dvd that looked and played just as well. If I had to do it over again I probably would have skipped the blu ray version. Prices are UK Version- $29.99, UK version with coffin- $39.99 and US version $69.99. Good Luck on your selection.",1469059200,2,656,4.093023255813954
6498318,5,B00LPDOI5Y,"A fabulous box set indeed. I appreciate and find myself drawn to special box sets this container is no exception. The viewing of the DVDs is exceptional the quality is superb details unbelievable what Blu-ray brings to the viewing experience has no equal. I noticed another reviewer complaining they cant play this Blu-ray it is not the Blu-ray's fault.  Note that on Blu-ray players from time to time  they need to be replaced  I just replaced my Blu-ray player with a new one, it plays this set just fine. Technology continues to improve and therefore with that being said from time to time spend a few dollars to replace your Blu-ray players.",1468368000,,645,4.741071428571429
6498319,5,B00LPDOI5Y,"This purchase for me is proof that I need to read the reviews more often! For some reason, I thought the coffin itself was the disc holder! Nah it's just an cool extra box that they could have made slightly bigger so that the actual case wasn't such a tight squeeze. I've been wanting this series on bluray for a long time and finally caved when I got some bday credit. I'm glad I waited for the coffin box to go down in price (I purchased for $41.98). I LOVE these shows and can't wait to binge watch them!",1466467200,9,507,4.1313131313131315

6498321,5,B00LPDOI5Y,You do not need to pay extra for the coffin case unless that's what you're after. Amazon also sells without the coffin case and it is the same set.,1464652800,,147,4.103448275862069

6498323,4,B00LPDOI5Y,"Great looking coffin box.
However these region free discs are not as smooth playing as region 1 discs.
After having problems with these discs not playing smooth I actually bought the US
version. I am keeping the coffin box and keeping my US discs inside.
I will sell or give away the discs that came with this coffin box.
Of course my Blu Ray player might need a firmware update but I still like the US version discs better.",1455926400,,424,4.379746835443038
6498324,5,B00LPDOI5Y,All i can say is EXCELLENT these are the movies that made me fall in love with horror except the creature from the black lagoon that i saw later on after i fell in love with the Horror movie genre everything played good just can not stand all the junk that plays when i press play on my blu-ray player remote i want to see the movie not something else like copyright menus stuff about Universal well that was fascinating,1455408000,,420,4.2625
6498325,5,B00LPDOI5Y,The picture doesn't do justice. I absolutely love this box set. It worth every penny.,1454889600,,85,4.733333333333333

6498328,5,B00LPDOI5Y,"I am extremely impressed with not only the quality of the blu-ray transfers, but the box set presentation as well. As someone who last saw these films on VHS, I can say these films look insanely clear from those days. Although, I never owned or watched the DVDs so I don't know how much of an improvement they are from that. Also, I suggest anyone who loves these movie to buy this set while it's the cheapest set out there. You can't go wrong with a blu-ray set for $60 ($7.50 per film) plus a ton of awesome extras!",1443398400,12,517,4.232323232323233
6498329,5,B00LPDOI5Y,"It was certainly high time to replace my old Laserdiscs of some of these classics, I am however glad I waited.  At first, I was a tad skeptical as was intended for European mkt, but being blu ray, they play just fine and quality is superb!.  Many of the other reviews helped me decide.  The ""coffin"" isn't as big as you might guess.  Its 7"" H and 5.5in deep.  Just don't like all the clutter of European rating codes all over the packaging (most of them come off but they littered the fronts of the DVDs with it.  Logos like  ""fit for viewing for 15 and older"" by Irish Flim Classification, etc.  If you want the ""coffin"" you will get all that no extra charge.  I haven't watched all of them yet but those I have are excellent restorations I agree that seeing these with the digital restoration is a real treat.  Altho the noisy old optical sound tracks were part of the nostalgia, its great having clearer and better audio..  If you have 3D - the 3D Creature will blow you away!... I've seen it in theaters many years ago and it was never this good.  Back then it was with the anaglyphic 3D process (the name given to the stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by means of encoding each eye's image using filters of different (usually chromatically opposite) colors, typically red and cyan).  Universal did release the Creature in that anaglyph process on vhs and beta, but they were awful.  Now with this restoration this and other 3D for blu ray DVDs use a much better process for glasses for the two main systems out there -powered LCD and passive polarized.  I find the Creature 3D disc terrific on my Samsung 3D HDTV (powered LCD glasses-the better system IMHO but glasses more $ and need power)  with several scenes that jump out at you like the claw in the rock.",1441584000,12,1763,4.445482866043614

6498331,3,B00LPDOI5Y,"Buyer beware. I couldn't get mine to play on 2 different DVD players, so I suspect that these won't play on US blue ray DVD players,",1437609600,,132,4.115384615384615
6498332,5,B00LPDOI5Y,"My fiance is an avid universal monsters fan and just horror in general. He had several copies of these movies on VHS or DVD but didn't have a collectors edition of anything. This one is amazing! The coffin case is amazing and was a really big hit with my fiance, although the first couple times taking it out it's very stiff and can be a little difficult. He said the extra features on the discs were incredibly interesting. Great quality on the blu-rays. For anyone wondering the difference between this UK version and the US version, there's basically no difference. Only thing we really noticied was that the start menu gives you options for many different languages while the US version is automatically English. It was worth it to get this incredibly unique coffin case in the UK version. Highly recommend!",1432598400,9,811,4.75886524822695

8667618,4,B00LPDOI5Y,"It's a great buy, but for someone who didn't do their research, the Phantom of The Opera is not the black and white version of the film: It is the colored version, which was a tad disappointing, but the rest of the films are great and they work on my PS4, PS3, and Blu-Ray player.",1515024000,,280,4.109090909090909

8667620,4,B00LPDOI5Y,"Not one bad movie in the whole collection.  A box full of stone cold classics.  Spectacular.  One downside- the coffin packaging was not in great shape when it arrived... tear down the right side of it.  All the discs inside are in perfect shape, and I really only care about the movies themselves, but it was a cool looking set that just did not quite make the trip through the mail.",1490745600,,384,4.366197183098592

Some people have complained about navigating the menus of the Blu-Rays, but I personally have had no issues there. A play button is a play button no matter what.

I absolutely love this little box. Easily in the top ten of box sets. A great addition to any collection.",1482710400,,525,4.402061855670103
