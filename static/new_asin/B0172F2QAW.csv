8737982,1,B0172F2QAW,"INEXCUSABLY HORRIBLE audiovisual quality!

This is the exact same public domain VHS transfer so common on $1 DVD releases.
A crushing disappointment.
This is a true Japanese Sci-Fi classic film and very well done but it may never get the respect it deserves unfortunately.

Tragic.

*If you want a decent copy of this film and don't mind subtitles look for ASIN: B0093T4EJ2, a Japanese language edition.
My copy is DVD-R, Region 0 (ALL) and NTSC video format.
Quality is about 8/10, a Tremendous improvement over the English public domain version!",1513296000,,547,5.055555555555555
