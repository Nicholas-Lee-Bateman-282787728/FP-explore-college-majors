8440019,3,B004SNN9TE,"At Lockdown, TNA promoted three main events, making the card look stacked; unfortunately, the events ended up being pretty average thanks to a slacking undercard and two main events that simply didn't live up to the hype. For an all cage match PPV and no PG restrictions, TNA was made to look tamer than the WWE, which could showcase one match without blood and get across brutality more effectively than TNA.

The star match of the night was the Lethal Lockdown match between Fortune and Immortal that featured a nearly flawless performance that pitted TNA veterans against Immortal's henchmen. The match did exactly what all those old WarGames matches in WCW accomplished; it put a bunch of guys in the ring at the same time and let mayhem ensue.

The other two main events didn't come off as well. Jarrett and Angle had a good match that suffered from a bumpy pace and bad planning between the referees and the performers that left people looking confused both in and out of the ring. The TNA Title match between Sting, Anderson and RVD was short and devoid of any heat. When Sting won, nobody seemed to care.

The undercard didn't feature anything memorable beyond Mickie James winning the Knock Outs Title from Madison Rayne in a surprising fashion. Guys like Samoa Joe, Hernandez and Matt Morgan seemed wasted in matches that were either uninspired or poorly booked. Even the over-booked cluster cage match opener seemed like all the guys were on autopilot.

Lockdown is generally considered one of TNA's most important shows, but this time around it only felt like he top echelon of the roster gave a damn and everyone else performed like it was a house show. All together, only get it if you are a TNA die hard.",1408838400,,1719,4.72
8440020,2,B004SNN9TE,"While TNA's Lockdown ppvs are awesome, this one falls short.

Outside of the main events the rest of of the matches are really nothing special (and the 20-second Mickie James title win just screams Royal Rumble 2010 for me).

The Angle/Jarrett match isn't bad but there are better matches between these two. And the storyline by this time just felt uncomfortable to watch and this match followed suit.

The Sting/RVD/Anderson title match was a good . . . 7 minute . . . match. This match was promoted like crazy and had the potential to be awesome but the match is so short. I'm assuming this was due to time constraints since Lethal Lockdown is a long match. So the three wrestlers tried to put 20 minutes of stuff into a 7-minute match. Hurting it tremendously.

The only good match on this show is Lethal Lockdown. It's violent, bloody, exciting, it's Lethal Lockdown.

The only good match is Lethal Lockdown, unless you want this match, this ppv is not worth it and best just skipped over.",1404432000,,993,4.619318181818182
8440021,4,B004SNN9TE,all the matches was great. the 1 match that is my personal favorite is fortune vs. immortal in lethal lockdown,1378252800,,110,4.55

8440023,4,B004SNN9TE,"Xscape Match: Amazing Red vs. Brian Kendrick vs. Chris Sabin vs. Jay Lethal vs. Suicide vs. Jeremy Buck vs. Max Buck vs. Robbie E - There were only two legal men allowed in the ring at a time & after the eliminations, the final two men battle with the winner being the one who's able to do escape the cage.  The only real story told here was the continued problems between the former members of Generation Me as Max kept avoiding Jeremy throughout the match until Jeremy finally got his hands on him & proceeded to pound on him & ram him into the cage.  Unlike the previous Xscape matches, this was a basic match without any real heavy or big spots you would expect with the ending involving the referee coming off very flat.

Right around here was an Eric Bischoff promo that was pointless & just came off as ""Well, here's how I'll get my camera time for the night.""  Didn't TNA learn anything from WrestleMania earlier in the month, too much talking on a PPV isn't a good thing.

Scott Steiner & Crimson vs. Eric Young & Orlando Jordan vs. Ink Inc. vs. British Invasion - Just came off like the previous match where they tried to do some stuff but again, it just came off uneventful with the only things major things happening being the issues continuing between Shannon Moore's disrespectful attitude (including constantly mocking Scott Steiner) conflicting with Jesse Neal while Eric Young was being his usual goofy self getting the rules of the match confused.  It's watchable as Steiner had the standout performance here.

Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne vs. Mickie James - Mickie James put her hair on the line here just to get another shot at the Knockouts Championship.  Unfortunately Mickie came into the match with a separated shoulder so this was a short squash (Madison's entrance took longer than the actual match) but I'll give credit in that Madison took some good bumps on the cage & with the DDT to really sell the beating.

Samoa Joe vs. D'Angelo Dinero - It should be noted before I get started that they kept doing this weird camera angle throughout the match as they kept showing a camera running through the crowd showing a wide shot of the cage which got very annoying.  This was subtitled ""Submission vs. Street"" which I think implied that Joe could only win by submission as they never really made it clear what the meaning behind that was.  They traded momentum throughout the match with various moves like Pope's leg sweep/clothesline combination & later even delivering Chris Jericho's ""Codebreaker"", Joe's strong strikes & snap powerslam & later doing a unique leg lariat that looked like a legdrop from a standing position, and both men trading slaps.  Whenever things got too difficult for Pope, he tried to run away & escape the cage only for Joe to ""make an ass"" of him before applying the Kokina Clutch for the win.  I personally think this feud (storyline wise) has done more to hurt than help both men but the match itself was very good with both men having great chemistry & the first standout match of the night.

Matt Morgan vs. Hernandez - This started out as a fight from the start as both men started slugging it out.  Mexican America was out at ringside & was able to get involved with Anarcha at one point grabbing Hernandez's leg through the camera hole in the cage allowing Hernandez to get the advantage.  The cage did come into play several times as Hernandez delivered his shoulderblock into the cage while also grinding Morgan's head into the cage while later Morgan got his receipt by ramming Hernandez into the cage.  For those who remember their previous cage match at last year's Victory Road, they played out the same story here except the roles were reversed in that Hernandez was more focused on showing off & embarrassing Morgan instead of winning the match which came back to haunt him in the end but it came off better here than it did in their previous cage match as this was the best match possible we were going to get out of these two.  After the match, keep watching as we get a special bonus ""catfight"" between Sarita, Rosita, and another knockout that had unfinished business with them.

Ultra Male Rules Match: Kurt Angle vs. Jeff Jarrett - Ultra Male Rules is just another variation of the ""3 Degrees Of Pain"" match or WWE's ""3 Stages Of Hell"" in that it's a ""2 out of 3 falls"" match with each fall having a special stipulation.  Karen Angle was removed from ringside before the match started while Kurt Angle didn't do his usual entrance (coming up from the ground & posing for pyro) to put over how serious this match was.  The first fall was submission only which saw both men exchange submissions & counters like Jarrett doing a sleeper/body scissors combination along with an attempted figure four & armbar that Angle was able to reverse while Angle kept attempting the anklelock for Jarrett to keep finding a way to escape.  Pinfalls only was the second fall as Angle was dominate here for the most part including delivering one hell of a superplex that had his just toss Jarrett from the top rope along with him giving a response to his ""twitter war"" over what Randy Orton did at WrestleMania with the only thing bad to say is that finish coming off as very confusing for everyone.  The final fall had the key left in the cage door so that was another way of being able to escape.  Angle made it clear throughout the match that his intentions were to punish & pay Jarrett back for everything instead of just winning the match as he had chances to leave the cage only to not do it & cause Jarrett to be on the receiving end of 5 straight german suplexes, grinding his head into the cage making him bleed.  Angle took punishment here too as he was on the receiving end of a powerbomb off the top rope onto his neck that should have killed him only to come back right away with giving Jarrett an Angle Slam off the top rope only to attempt a moonsault off the top rope that missed Jarrett completely.  We saw appearances from Gunner, Steiner, and Karen Angle towards the end while telling the story of Kurt just refusing to go down.  All I can say about this match is that this was very physical & the match of the night for me as this defined the phrase ""they left it all in the ring.""

TNA Champion Sting vs. Mr. Anderson vs. Rob Van Dam - Due to Anderson's attitude towards both men leading up to & at the start this match, he was the ""odd man out"" as both Sting & RVD took turns beating him up.  This had some good moments between all three men such as Sting applying a double scorpion deathlock to both men, Anderson's double mic check, and Sting doing a scorpion deathdrop on RVD while having a double clothesline with Anderson.  The bigger story here was the appearance of Hulk Hogan with a pipe trying to help RVD win the championship thinking he was going to join Immortal only for RVD to say make his decision, Mr. Anderson trying to take advantage of the situation, and Sting being able to retain his title.  The match was decent & had some nice moments but it was more about the story with Hogan & ""what would RVD do?"" than anything else.

Lethal Lockdown - Fortune vs. Immortal: Daniels, Kazarian, Beer Money vs. Bully Ray, Abyss, Matt Hardy, Ric Flair - For those who haven't seen a Lethal Lockdown match, it's held under the same rules which the old WCW/NWA match of War Games where under. One man from each team starts the match and after a period of time, another member from one team (which has always been the heel team for those trivia buffs) enters and after each time period, the teams alternate sending members in. Once all team members enter the cage, the roof containing all the weapons is lowered onto the cage and the only way to win is by pinfall or submission.
As usual with a Lethal Lockdown match, this had it's share of moments like Bully Ray living up to his name as you could hear him trash talking Immortal non-stop while him & Matt Hardy kept smashing the cage into Kaz's face from the outside, James Storm destroying a beer bottle over Flair's head causing him to have a ""crimson mask"" while also getting the pants beat off his (literally), Fortune being dominate with the weapons, Abyss getting knocked out of the cage, Daniels almost falling off the side of the cage before diving off, Bully Ray nailing everyone in sight with stiff kendo stick shots, and the return of The Phenomenal One.  This was what it intended to be...a war with Fortune coming off as strong dominating babyfaces.  Great match.

It should be noted that Brother Devon & Anarcha of Hernandez's ""Mexican America"" group faced off in the pre-show match.  The show started off slow but picked up over time & delivered a great (but not perfect) quality show overall as Lockdown usually is as we got some of the best performances from the ongoing feuds (Joe/Pope, Fortune/Immortal, Angle/Jarrett, Morgan/Hernandez) with each match getting a decent amount of time (minus the Knockouts due to Mickie's injury) so this is an event that's worth checking out for a viewing.",1303689600,2,9047,4.569839307787392

1. Jay Lethal vs Max Buck vs Jeremy Buck vs Suicide vs Robbie E vs Brian Kendrik vs Amazing Red vs Chris Sabin Xscape Match: This was a good way to watch the show, some great high flying moves, I think that the best few got eliminated 1st in the match which I didn't like but there are some great stuff from the bucks and lethal, I liked this match and the ending ***1/4

2. Crimsom/Scott Steiner vs Ink Inc vs Eric Young/Orlando Jordan vs British Invasion: This was pretty good, steiner hits a suplex on everyone which was great to see, the thing with eric sucked but oh well, the british invasion were good to, the ending was sort of out of nowhere , but oh well, I expected this match to be worse **3/4

3. Samoa Joe vs The Pope: This was a good solid match, it went on for 10 minutes, and these two had a lot of chemistry, I liked the ending but I would of liked to see this match go on for another 5 or so minutes ***

4. Hernandez vs Matt Morgan: This was watchable at best, this wasn't great at all, easily the worst match of the night, the only thing I liked was the ending **

5. Kurt Angle vs Jeff Jarret Ultra Male Rules, 1st fall=Submission Match, 2nd fall=Pinfall, 3rd fall= Escape the cage: This was an amazing match, the 1st fall only went on for like 4 minutes, and was not that good, but the last 2 falls were great, angle almost killed himself twice, one with a top rope powerbomb where angle landed on his head, then he hits a mental moonsault off the top of the cage, the match goes back and forth until the ending where karen gets involved but I didn't really hate the ending because it helped the fued and the story a lot, overall a amazing match ****1/4

6. Sting(c) vs Mr Anderson vs RVD TNA World Title: This was slightly dissapointing, it only went on for 7 minutes! These guys hit eachothers finishers, and the ending was pretty good, but I was dissapointed with the outcome **3/4

7. Immortal vs Fortune Lethal Lockdown Match: This was a great main event, very bloody even without the weapons, Immortal had the advantage so they dominated most of the match, then the weapons come into play and then this match turns great, daniels and hardy climbed up the cage and hardy hit a twist of fate, then after this daniels hits a sick spot where he does a crossbody off the cage to the outside on hardy and aybss, Bully Ray cleans house with the kendo stick, and it was great to see AJ Styles come back, and then the ending was out of nowhere, I will say that flair bleeds buckets after getting hit with a glass bottle from storm, this was a great lethal lockdown match, and my second favourite match of the night ****

Match of the Night: Angle vs Jarret
Worst Match of Night: Hernandez vs Morgan
Moment of Night: Angle hits a moonsault off the top of the cage!!!

Overall PPV: 8.5/10

The best TNA PPV that I have seen in a long time, maybe since turning point 2009, so watch this show because it is a lot of fun and includes some great matches and one classic match.",1303344000,,3001,4.249122807017544
8440025,5,B004SNN9TE,"The 8 way Xscape match while lacking in the high-flying action,it was still a pretty good opener. The 4 way-4 team match had solid double team action and pretty good brawling. The Mickie James-Madison Rayne match was super short but super sweet. Both the Pope-Samoa Joe and the Hernandez-Matt Morgan matches were pretty good/decent brawls. The Jeff Jarrett-Kurt Angle-2 out of 3 falls match was a solid,smash-mouth,back-and-forth bout. The RVD-Sting-Mr. Anderson 3 way match for the TNA world title was a hard-hitting,innovative,fast paced brawl. The Lethal Lockdown match between Immortal(Rick Flair,Bully Ray,Matt Hardy & Abyss) and Fortune(Kazarian,Daniels and Beer Money) was a bloody,hardcore,smash-mouth,hard-hitting brawl and once again,a good reminder of both NWA's Wargames from the 1980's and the 1990's ECW. I give this event a 9 out of 10.",1302998400,,851,5.604651162790698
