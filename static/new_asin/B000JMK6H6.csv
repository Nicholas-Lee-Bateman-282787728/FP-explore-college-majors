8152349,5,B000JMK6H6,"Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems like Screen Door Jesus could be interpreted a couple different ways relating to the humor it's going for.  It's about the image of Jesus appearing on a screen door in a small Texas town however you'd be surprised to know that a good chunk of this movie is clearly not intended as humor... at least I don't think it is.  I could be wrong.  It makes you think it's humorous for a little while until you get about 25% into it.  Then it clearly becomes a well-told, elaborate drama.

You see the writers are either going for an honest approach in how southern folks would react to the unexplainable appearance of Jesus on a screen door, or perhaps I have it all wrong and the writers are playing on the stereotype that southern folks are gullible enough to believe that God really is speaking to them by way of having Jesus on a screen door.  You see it's really tricky and I'm honestly not sure which one the writers are going for.

While I initially believed in the former, watching the movie the entire way through actually makes me change my mind and lean towards the other one, and that this storyline is supposed to illustrate how a small southern town would really react to such a thing while only exaggerating a little bit.

Assuming the writers are going for a sincere type of story with subtle touches of humor thrown in occasionally, this movie does a remarkable job in that respect.  What happens is that the appearance of Jesus (which is nicely done and believable by the way) appearing on a black lady's screen door makes the entire small town come over and basically stand around worshipping the picture all day and night.  The lady gets fed up eventually and wants everyone off her property when she realizes they're taking the image of Jesus WAY too seriously.  Can't blame her either.  When the people carry the lady away from her own property... LOL!  THAT'S a funny moment!  If this sounds like a strange movie, it is!  It's actually cleverly written.

What this picture of Jesus quietly does is make everyone around town question their own beliefs, and amazingly the story covers a remarkable variety of predicaments.  The story is told by jumping around from one group of people and their problems directly into another segment/other people.  The movie basically keeps going back and forth between 4 or 5 different stories.  The only issue I have is that most of them are never resolved in a way that presents a proper conclusion.  Then again maybe it's not supposed to.  We *are* dealing with beliefs after all which leaves the door wide open (no pun intended!) for all kinds of interpretations.

Now I'm from the north so the behavior of these southern folks strikes me as a little odd but perhaps this is all normal.  I'm admittedly not familiar with the southern way other than talking to a few online friends from Texas and Georgia.  Again, assuming this is a sincere representation of southern folks and not a mockery which is a tricky line.  Let me mention some of the characters/stories so you know what to expect.  One of them is a black teen whose family member is bedridden and turns to Jesus on the screen door for answers and prayers, another relates to a young adult man and a VERY hot woman who fall in love with each other but there's a catch- the girl doesn't want to fall in love with someone who has a different religion from hers, so she wants him to convert.  Of course he doesn't really want to.

Another story pertains to a grandmother baptizing her two grandsons much to the displeasure of her... son (I think) and his wife (who has a different religion from the grandmother and rejects her beliefs outright).  The one with the banker father who could have made a difference in the life of a black man but chose not to because he thought he was making the right business decision is a memorable one and perhaps a personal favorite of mine due to the rocky relationship between him and his son.  There's other stories relating to the townspeople and how hypocritical and crooked they are in the eyes of others which results in a few violent scenes.  As you can see there's several unexpected layers of complexity to the storyline and it all works.  Not only does the story work, but it also covers all the major sins of the human race and finds a way to creatively express how they're wrong through fantastic and clever writing.

Without giving away the ending let's just say the moral here is that regardless what your beliefs are, it's just important to always believe in God and Jesus.  At least that's the message I got out of the last 10 minutes.  The acting is surprisingly good, and the religious talk is easily understandable for the most part and allows you to open your mind and think.  Overall I enjoy the movie.  Not sure why this movie slipped through the cracks of time and it's now forgotten.  It's memorable.  Now hopefully this wasn't all a great big mockery intended to make viewers look like a fool. :)",1399161600,,4999,4.561659192825112

Set in a little town in East Texas the story is so offbeat that it is a riot.",1353974400,,125,3.8076923076923075
8152351,2,B000JMK6H6,"Each day's script must have been written on set.  There are too many characters who never think, feel, say, or do anything interesting.  It's a shame because 3 of the actresses seemed capable of a lot more.",1338249600,,206,4.54054054054054
8152352,4,B000JMK6H6,"This was a really good movie, watch it over and over! It's amazing how differently people believe.  Some graphic language, so strictly for adult viewing.  There is some comedy in the movie also.  This movie is thought-provoking, and very interesting.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1312675200,3,276,5.204545454545454
8152353,1,B000JMK6H6,"Don't let the word, ""Jesus"" in the title fool anyone into buying this DVD.  I was asked why the 'R' rating, I thought it might be the Southern humor.  There isn't any humor in it.  There is so many nasty mouth people in it.  No God loving, sin washed in Jesus Blood believers, should put themselves through this trash.  I bought this DVD under the christian movie section.  There isn't enough information on this movie; so maybe this will help keep other believers from throwing away money.  I will have only lost $9.00; but it will be worth it if I can keep others from buying this DVD.  I will not send it back to let anyone from putting it up for sale again.",1288656000,4,661,4.274193548387097
8152354,3,B000JMK6H6,I want the song sung by that guy but can not find it any which way... screen door jesus or Back door Jesus... I think it gets played in the ending credits... the cast was right on.. and it was one of the best religious comedies I've seen... besides The Preachers Wife.,1283990400,,268,4.173076923076923
