8472581,4,B005H24SF4,"If you are a glutton for melancholic Japanese movies, this one's for you. I won't rehash the plot because you can read that in the product description. Like the wonderfully acclaimed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Departures/dp/B0038AL7EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Departures</a>&nbsp;(Okuribito), this film centers on a young couple and revolves around the themes of love and loss. It stars&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SMAP/dp/B00005MB5X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SMAP</a>&nbsp;member Tsuyoshi Kusanagi as Saku Makimura, a semi-successful sci-fi magazine writer and doting husband whose wife falls ill with colon cancer. It is inspired by the true story of Taku Mayumura.

At its heart, this is a love story. It does a wonderful job of showing the intimacy between Saku and Setsuko and is very convincingly acted by the leads. Through their friends, the backstory, and dialogue, you truly see their devotion to each other. It is also a terrific glimpse into the daily life and home of a young Japanese couple somewhere in Japan. (I say ""somewhere"" because the filmmakers were very careful to fictionalize locations and remove all references to addresses from signs and documents.) Filled with vintage robot toys, Saku's room is a toy collector's dream. Viewers who have lived in Japan will also feel a great sense of nostalgia.

This film is best suited for those who appreciate foreign cinema, have some knowledge of Japanese culture, and prefer reading subtitles over dubbing. Japanese films, especially, demand a certain amount of patience and are not for everyone. This story takes place over the course of several years (you can guess by the title how many) and can get pretty dull if you're expecting a lot to happen. Periodically in the film, we venture into Saku's imagination. It is a fantastical world of aliens, space ships, and robots. There are moments of comedy here, but most of the film is slow paced and serious.

This movie is very long at 2 hrs 15 mins and certainly feels like it. For me, it really started to drag along at the 90 min mark, knowing there's another 45 mins ahead. It would've been stronger shortened to 110-120 mins, in my opinion, because we don't need to see all the scenes in the hospital of him struggling to write. I also wanted to see more of his stories. You see maybe 15 of them throughout the course of the movie. Overall, a good film. Could've been much better shortened.",1317427200,3,2511,5.400510204081633
8472582,4,B005H24SF4,"This movie is based on a true story.  A somewhat successful science fiction writer with a vivid imagination and a child's heart learns that his wife is dying of cancer. He tries to hide this fact from her, and, in response to the doctor's suggestion that laughter is good for the immune system, he determines to write a short story a day to keep her alive.  However, she is the realist of the two.  Her husband's biggest fan, she reads and reviews everything he writes. We always have the impression that she knows more than she tells him.

For a time, he seems to succeed. His wife's illness seems to be at bay. As he piles one story on top of another, the viewer is sometimes treated to a pictorial retelling of a story.  We come to know of his attraction to boxy 1950s robots, his identification with children, his delight in the unexpected and magical. There is often a sad element to a story, which does not diminish its curious and delightful nature.

However, in time, his wife's condition worsens, and even his stories cannot cure her or help her avoid her fate.  She finally explains to him what he had hidden from her all along: she is aware that she is dying.  His vow to write her a story a day had revealed the truth that he couldn't speak. Nevertheless, he continues to write. He is obsessed by his love and mission until her death leaves his pages empty.  He allows the wind to carry his last unfinished story away just as the wind whipping through her hospital room seems to have carried her spirit away.

Do not be deterred by the length of this movie, although it seems to drag at the end as we sit with him waiting for the painful inevitable death. Also, do not be deterred by the subtitles.  This movie will make you laugh and cry, and you will be touched by the endless love between this boyish, imaginative young man and his tender and wise wife.",1314144000,2,1868,4.401162790697675
