7806328,5,6300217825,"I knew in advance, of course, that the product I purchased was second-hand, previously used.  I can't tell you how skeptical I was about that.  HOWEVER, the product description was accurate and the quality of the VHS tape I received was far beyond my expectations.  My order was filled promptly and I would definitely deal with this retailer again.",1262822400,,348,4.864406779661017
7806329,3,6300217825,I bought it mostly because it was the only place I could find Dale Gonyea.  He was funnier when I saw him.  That's all I really watched.  Howie Mandell was very corny.,1212019200,,167,4.15625
7806330,5,6300217825,"A collection of U.S. Government films covering a wide variety of topics from surviving an atom bomb (duck and cover!) to surviving sexual relations; from controlling a riot to controlling your temper. 8 volumes, roughly 60 minutes each.

From the back: ""Since motion pictures began to flourish as a medium, one film studio has produced more movies and spent more money doing it than any other. That studio is the United States Government.

Federal Follies is a hilarious collection of these films (color and B&W,) because at the time each was made, the subject matter was approached with the utmost seriousness. Today, they make for an extraordinary viewing experience, both for their unintentional humor and historical content.""

Vol. 5 contains the following episodes:

Shadow of a Gunfight (U.S. Army) - The Army goes Western with absurd results.
On Post Safety (U.S. Army) - Hapless Hal dies trying in showing us safety.
Thunderbolt (U.S. Air Force) - Spectacular combat footage; sheep, horses and farms are suitable targets.
Code of Conduct (U.S. Army) - Jack Webb and how to be the perfect P.O.W.",1163721600,,1102,5.071823204419889
