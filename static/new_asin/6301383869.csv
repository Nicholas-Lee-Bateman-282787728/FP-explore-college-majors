331060,4,6301383869,"I purchased this adaption of Little Dorrit several years ago on laserdisc and I enjoyed it, but  I found that to fully appreciate this film it was necessary to watch it to the end. The point to this film adaption of a Dicken's book was to tell the same story twice but through differing viewpoints. Certainly the story is not as interesting or as gripping as Dickens more widely read novels and the film could have been improved by cutting and picking up the pace, but I believe the director accomplished his goal.
The first half of the film is dark and bleak, people are seen suffering a miserable existence and you do have to wade through a rather pessimistic view of life; but in the second half of the film we see a differing view of life. We see the same scenes over again but now we see them through Dorrit's eyes. The world becomes a new place; it is bright and life itself is a joy. In the midst of squalor Dorrit's optimism colors everything new. Little Dorrit seen in the first half is a sad young woman but now she is a young woman full of life. Whatever Dickens is telling you in his novel this film is telling you that life is what you make it.
This is how I watched the film. And I enjoyed it.",1038873600,21,1207,4.225108225108225
331061,4,6301383869,"Part two of this ambitious film is a definite improvement over part one. It develops themes and fills out the plot (as really any second half of a story should), though you could never watch part two without seeing part one. The most jarring thing about this part is the insistence of recreating most of part one scene for scene (only this time through the eyes of Little Dorrit). Perhaps the most notable thing about this film (for me anyway) is that it contains the last lead performance in a film from Alec Guinness (all his subsequent roles, up to his 1996 retirement, were cameos) and he is wonderful in his fourth screen interpretation of a Dickens character. The rest of the cast is also fabulous (including the last screen performance of Joan Greenwood as Mrs Clennam). It has been said before - you will either love this adaption, or hate it.",1024185600,27,851,4.605263157894737
331062,3,6301383869,"Made in 1987 and boasting a 200 plus cast and essentaially a 6 hour film in 2 parts, director Christine Edzard's adaption of one of Dickens' least read novels is only partially successful. It is told from the point of view of Arthur Clennam (Dereck Jacobi) who on his return to London becomes interested in the case of William Dorrit, locked in a debtor's prison for 25 years and his daughter, seamstress to Clennam's mother. Despite excellent performances and eye for detail part one is very slow moving and drawn out (and one can't believe that after 3 hours, it is only halfway through the story). One has to wait for part 2 for a satisfactory conclusion to the tale...",1024012800,10,672,4.608333333333333
331063,1,6301383869,"I saw this adaptation of Little Dorrit at a local theater when it was first released.  It had received such favorable reviews I thought I was in for a treat:  Dickens translated to film impeccably.  Instead, I found it to be the director's idea of Dorrit, a stale and rancid interpretation.  I sat through the first part until intermission and then ran from the cinema, relieved to be in fresh air again.
 Little Dorrit is the only one of Dickens' novels I haven't read, but I can imagine the original characters are beautifully imagined and a joy to read.  But the  movie's  counterparts a are either over the top or understated, and the film as a whole is a huge disappointment.  Yesterday, I borrowed the video from our local library and gave the picture another chance.  This time, I stood it for ten minutes and then gave it the hook, irritated once again by the wretched pauses, Derek Jacobi's unchanging countenance, and the ill-conceived whole.  It's still an insufferably long-winded mess, abetted by a muffled soundtrack and unimaginative photography.
  For truly delightful BBC video adaptations of Victorian novels, I highly recommend the recent Dickens' ""Our Mutual Friend,"" and Trollope's ""The Pallisers"" (1974 vintage, but still splendidly acted and totally absorbing.)",1011225600,13,1284,5.057142857142857
331064,2,6301383869,"Judging by the other very positive reviews here I am in the minority when I say this was heavy going. Watching this has actually served to put me off Dickens!  The video undoubtedly captures the atmosphere of the times, but the story is sooo weak and cliched with characters and events that seem unbelievable even for a Dickens work. Characters were too nice or too nasty and came into and went out of money just a bit too conveniently for me to swallow.  For diehard D fans only I think.",1009756800,5,488,4.411111111111111
331065,5,6301383869,"In recent years there have been some excellent productions of Dicken's works, including the BBC's Martin Chuzzlewit and the lushly beautiful Our Mutual Friend, neither of these would I want to be without in my video  library!
But this production of Little Dorrit is done with a totally  different eye, a unique approach, that I thought takes you straight into  the novel.  The producers of this film built the most unique sets and you  have the remarkable feeling of at first watching a play unfolding before  you only to find as you watch and become familiar with the usual Dickens  plethora of characters that you are actually on a street in London in front  of the Marshallsea yourself.  It must have been very like this once, with  the noise and confusion of such a city pressing all about and out of it  emerges first one story and then another.
I thought the technique of  telling the same story twice through different eyes helped to explain many  things that a straight once through telling would have missed.
Excellent  acting, beautiful music, all from Verdi, and a screenplay that captures the  spirit of a great novel, makes this one part of my library we've already  watched several times!",944784000,70,1202,4.762135922330097
331066,4,6301383869,"It is a long and involved story but worth the attention. As with most british films, it is slow going in the begining then works up to a surprising end.

7811967,5,6301383869,"This is the best and most interesting version of Little Dorrit around (both films ""Nobody's Fault"" and ""Little Dorrit's Story"" I mean).
Yes it omits outlying plots and compresses other plot devices and characters, but this is a film, not the book. And it's concentrated musings on money, bureaucracy, vengeance, self righteousness, love, caring and the mish-mash of peoples and how they influence each other cannot be beat. I find it has much more to say than the newer 2009, plodding miniseries. It has an otherworldliness about it that is like looking into a crystal ball and seeing images of the past there, but it is utterly convincing as ""real"". (the end of ""Barry Lyndon"" comes to mind: ""It was in the reign of King George III (Queen Victoria for ""Little Dorritt"") that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now."") For some reason I'm fond of the neurotic characters Fanny and Flora.... women trapped in their own sad inner worlds....perfectly played... as is Joan Greenwood's literally trapped Mrs Clennam. It's all about the worlds we make ourselves...regardless of where we really are, in prison or free and well off. This is what the films are concerned with and Dickens' characters and events are manipulated to drive these musings home. It's excellent!

As a costume designer and maker, I say: never has the early- mid 19th century fashion, high and low, been so well presented. I remember the all hand sewn !!!!!! costumes were on display at various museums when the film 1st came out. On a miniseries I worked on years later, we rented some silk 1840's gowns, used in the film, to put on extras. They WERE hand sewn, even the long seams in the skirt panels.... the only thing giving away that these gowns were not really from the 1840's was they weren't old, and they had nickel instead of brass hooks and eyes. AMAZING!

As I mentioned, this can be had on DVD in region 2 but not region 1.... and who knows what the transfer is like. I still watch my VHS tapes! It's simply time to get a non-region DVD player. There's just too many things distributors think we Americans won't like or won't ""get"".",1364860800,2,2185,4.702349869451697
7811968,5,6301383869,"This is the best of Dickens. The MP3 should help increase
the story's popularity. Amy is superior to Little Nell.",1364428800,,113,4.7
7811969,3,6301383869,"I am a big fan of all the Dickens stories but I somehow had never seen this one before.  The pace is a bit slow I found but all in all, I was still entertained by it.  My only compaint is that the main character Arthur Clennam, seemed a bit old to play this part in which he attracted such a young girl known as Little Dorrit.  I did not find this to be all that believable however the actors are so talented, I seemed to be able to overlook this minor issue for the most part.  The story has lots of good subplots and the actors are first rate.  I found out Dickens real father was actually a resident of the debtors prison called the Marshalsea, in this story.  I recommend this if you like Charles Dickens.",1358035200,,709,4.101449275362318
7811970,5,6301383869,"I have this version of Little Dorrit on Laser Discs and I hope they will come out with a DVD version of it.  Although I also have the Claire Foy/Mathew Macfadyen version of LD on DVD, I much prefer the Derek Jacobi/Alec Guinness one.",1354147200,3,233,4.295454545454546
7811971,2,6301383869,"This is a version of Little Dorrit told in two long segments, one from the male hero, Clennam's point of view, the other from the heroine, Little Dorrit's.  This approach is interesting in theory, but not that great in application.  The first part is so lacking in necessary detail that it feels scattered, jumpy and boring. The second fills in some of what's missing, but it is all done in such a way that it gets tiresome and frustrating to go back to the beginning and see the things we weren't shown the first time through.  The casting of key characters is not great either.  The actress who plays Amy Dorrit looks pasty and frail enough to have been raised in a prison, but she plays the role with such a feeble blankness that she seems barely more than a ghost, even in the segment told from her perspective.  And even in 1988, Derek Jacobi was way too old to be playing the 34 year-old Clennam.

There are a few stellar performances -- Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood bring a whole other dimension of complexity and depth to the characters of William Dorrit and Mrs. Clennam, and Eleanor Bron really nails the character of Mrs. Merdle.  But these three don't make up for the miscasting of other parts, the numerous completely missing plot points and characters (no Blandois, no Tattycoram, to name just two), the choppy editing, and the over-compression of a plot which makes sense when it spans some six or seven years, but just seems weird as shown here.

Though it is almost six hours long and some scenes are taken verbatim from the novel, too much is lost, and this mini-series does not, in my opinion, capture the sweep, substance or bizarre sweetness of the novel at all.  Watching this, you really see what skill and understanding are involved in other, better screenplay adaptations people like Andrew Davies write for the BBC.",1331251200,,1845,4.6523076923076925
7811972,5,6301383869,"Here's a news flash for lovers of this unique film.  I recently discovered that both volumes of the Little Dorrit pair are available for online streaming from Netflix!

No, they still aren't available in DVD, but Netflix somehow worked out a streaming rights deal anyway.

The first film, ""Nobody's Fault"" is in 4:3 aspect ratio and a pretty murky transfer.  I compared it carefully with my old Laser Disk and decided the streaming version is a little bit brighter and more detailed.  However, there are no subtitles or closed captions.  (The LD has CCs.) This is true of all Netflix streaming video, even the most recent HD releases, so it's apparently a limitation of their streaming technology.

The big revelation is the second volume, ""Little Dorrit's Story.""  It is in glorious 16:9 widescreen and  a LOT brighter and more detailed than the Laser Disk.  Around the quality of a not-great DVD.

None of this will do you much good if you don't have a Netflix account, but for those who do, this is major progress while we continue to wait for Criterion or someone to do a new DVD or BluRay release.",1290297600,4,1102,4.6875
