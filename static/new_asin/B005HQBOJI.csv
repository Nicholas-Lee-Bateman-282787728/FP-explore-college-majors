8473477,5,B005HQBOJI,"Delightful film with a superb British cast of character actors in addition to its lead, John Mills delivering a typically fine performance. Translates the H.G.Wells novel of 1910 into a charming light comedy piece of cinema. An enjoyable film from the golden age of British film comedy of the late 1940's and early 1950's. Captures the lost Edwardian/Victorian world of Wells novel exceptionally well. This is a competent DVD transfer.",1460937600,2,435,5.228571428571429

8473479,5,B005HQBOJI,"This is a classic not to be missed, John Mills was a great actor.
His portrayal of Mr Polly as the shy, unambitiuous young man, getting trapped in a marriage with one of his cousins, the escape from it and finding peace and fulfilment with the innkeeper, after being chased  and threatened by her former villaneous lover, ending with the accidental death of the latter, is hilarious.",1368144000,6,383,4.7164179104477615
8473480,4,B005HQBOJI,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""THE HISTORY OF MR. POLLY"" (1949  96 min/B&W) -- Starring: John Mills, Betty Ann Davies, Megs Jenkins, Finlay Currie, Gladys Henson, Diana Churchill, Shelagh Fraser, Edward Chapman, Dandy Nichols, Sally Ann Howes, Juliet Mills, Laurence Baskcomb

Directed by: Anthony Plissier

VCI has restored and brought from their vaults another great film from the British Invasion.

A masterpiece of acting. John Mills one of the best actors to come out of England with his superb acting skills.

The film is being directed by the author of the screenplay, Anthony Pelissier with warmth and a kind wit, and produced by its leading player John Mills.

It is difficult to imagine a better actor for the title role.  John Mills gives Mr Polly just the right amount of lightness, never once veering into pathos or overstating Polly's 'feebleness', as his wife later calls it.

One would ask the questions of do we like Mr. Polly?  Do we wish him to succeed? That is the jest of the plot and story line. Will we be like most and lose patience with him, or root for his final adventure and sharing what comes may.

The funeral of his father, which was more like a wedding party than a wake, with young women circling the newly rich innocent like sharks round a seal.  Really enjoy the scene where Mr Polly tries his hand at punting, struggling with his passenger and throwing them both in to the water.

The music here was brilliantly compsed for the wind of the orchestra and played by a team of virtuosos with an outstanding clarinettist  The composer William Alwyn was probably the most prolific film composer of his or any generation. His work here gave the film a well meanning lift.  The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Leader David McCallum and Conducted by Muir Mathieson.
