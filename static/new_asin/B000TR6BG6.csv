8210412,1,B000TR6BG6,"i checked out reviews of all  the scandinavian dvd's and this one was so highly rated.  i don't understand why.  they don't show anything.  only hippies, gay pride parade and food.  it was great to see the different foods this girl could buy in the deli, but do we have to watch her eat them.  for heaven's sake, she was sitting in the same square as the castle where the king lives!  could they have shown that? old town? castles?  very little landmarks.  this was a horrible dvd to represent sweden.  denmark wasn't any better.  norway was ok, do not buy this!",1514073600,,562,4.411764705882353

8210415,2,B000TR6BG6,"The title is unsuitable. There is nothing 'ultimate' about this package, which seems to target a low budget, backpacking type of audience. The attractions are slanted in favor of what you might call 'hippie' interests. I am left with a lot of questions and a strong feeling of disillusionment. Most of the activities can be done practically anywhere, and there is little focus on unique local entertainment, gifts or dining beyond what you find in somebody's cabin out in the boonies. I'm a middle aged boomer with an interest in comfort - not camping - and a memorable travel experience with shows and food and special gifts, and want to believe the region has something to offer my market, so I will look for more current information. That said, if I was a teenager looking for an affordable adventure, this video would be a good place to start.",1290384000,5,847,4.72972972972973
8210416,4,B000TR6BG6,"I am a fan of ""Globe Trekker"" in general, although I find some hosts vastly better at conveying local understanding than others. I bought this set for the excellent episode on Norway and Lapland featuring Ian Wright, the most entertaining and informative of the hosts. Wright's journey highlights the beauty of Norway and the uniqueness of Lapland and the Sami lifestyle; he even attempts to sing a Sami folk song in a very memorable moment. This episode is the best of the bunch and perfectly illustrates why I enjoy spending time in Norway (and Scandinavia in general).

The episodes on Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the Baltic states were worth watching, but didn't capture the nuances of the countries as well as Wright's episode. I felt the Baltic states in particular were a bit shortchanged, and frankly I find that a little of Megan McCormick goes a long way: she always manages to annoy me long before the episode is over. For the record, I find Wright and Justine Shapiro to be the most enjoyable ""Globe Trekker"" hosts.

This set has a bonus DVD featuring an Arctic trek and Scandinavian cooking, both of which I enjoyed.

If you are interested in travel to Scandinavia (and I certainly recommend you do so), I recommend this DVD set, mostly for the excellent coverage of Norway. Sweden, Denmark, and Finland are also adequately covered, although I find that with this series the host makes a marked difference in how enjoyable the individual episodes are.",1263427200,16,1465,4.852
8210417,3,B000TR6BG6,"Ian Wright is the most fun host of them all, but it's not all him on these two dvds.
 The title is off, because by definition Scandinavia includes Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
 The coverage of the Baltic states is far too short, almost nothing shown. Just as you get into watching the Talinn bit, it's over. Norway and Sweden are covered well, I'm guessing. I'drecommend to purchase a separate DVD for the country of interest, instead of hoping that ""Ultimate"" Sacndinavia covers it all, which it only attempts to do.",1196726400,5,516,4.722222222222222
