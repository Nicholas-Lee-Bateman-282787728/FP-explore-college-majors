7882003,1,6305067198,"SILLY sex-game movie along the lines of GAMES [Simone Signoret]  with an equally silly ending.  Mediocre young couple without any oomph in their normal lives invent personalities [Dr. Crippen and lover!] in the bedroom ... enter an odd older woman {Cilento channeling Dietrich] who ""kind of"" secudes both and introdces a new character spin [Das Red Baron!]- quaint and probably shcoking for 1968 London's swinging set ..... but really quite dull.

Jackson chews up the scenery shows glimpses of ""Women In Love"", etc and brays her way along merrily......

not really worth your while ... only if you really must - and Jackson's beauty spot moves around ..... make-up?????",1323388800,,670,5.1192660550458715
