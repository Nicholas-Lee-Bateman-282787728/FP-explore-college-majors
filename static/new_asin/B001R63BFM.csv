8337466,5,B001R63BFM,There are 26 episodes instead of 16. You can go to the IMDP web site which will give you some details of each one. Good series of 1950's. I have the entire series on three discs that I purchased several years ago at a good price.,1378512000,,229,4.0
8337467,5,B001R63BFM,"For all the devotees of the Jungle Jim 1940's series, with Johnny Weissmuller in the starring role, I can report that the '16 Adventures on 4 DVDs' set is now available on ebay. How do I know? Well, my son has just asked me to get them for him. Obviously I tried Amazon.com first, as that was the logical choice. Unfortunately I struck out - but undeterred went hunting elsewhere. I cannot vouch for the quality of the set available as I have only just ordered them myself, but it comes at a very reasonable price. And, as icing on the cake, the seller is in the UK - where I am. If you are not too desperate, I'll add an opinion after I've had a chance to see the recordings. I must stress that I have NO connection with the seller and stand to gain nothing from this review.

UPDATE
Well, the package arrived safely. The DVD's are all in a 4disc standard plastic case, and are obviously copies of the original set. Picture quality is on a par with the old Roy Rogers, Tom Mix, Lone Ranger, Rocketman films I used to see at the kid's Saturday Morning cinema in the 50's. I didn't check all 16 for editing, but the first couple were full-length. Jungle Jim's not to my taste, I'm sure my son will enjoy them.",1331078400,7,1208,4.252173913043478
8337468,5,B001R63BFM,It was like reliving my childhood watching these DVD's. Jungle Jim and Tarzan were my hero's when I was growing up.,1320451200,5,115,4.523809523809524
8337469,5,B001R63BFM,I am just waiting for this set to be put out again. I loved Johnny as Jungle Jim as well as tarzan and want the collection . I missed it the first time around and don't want to next time it comes out. I still remember watching it along with tarzan Saturday mornings on Art Grindles Jungle Theater. What a thrill.,1289606400,3,312,4.131147540983607
8337470,5,B001R63BFM,"These 16 short films are great for any Tarzan fan.
The quality of these 16 individual DVDs are exceptional.
Taken from the original masters they are clear and the
sound is surprisingly crisp. They are complete transfers
and not edited down versions. I purchased these 16 discs
this past January from a private vendor`s site and was
extremely pleased with the quality and content.
Beware of the 4 disc set. Buy the individual discs
which cost a bit more but are well worth it.
You won`t be disappointed.",1266192000,16,502,4.715909090909091
