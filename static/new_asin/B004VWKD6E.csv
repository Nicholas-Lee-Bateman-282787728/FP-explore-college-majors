8444204,5,B004VWKD6E,"First saw article about the 400 yr. old alter panels of Ciudad Rodrigo on CBS Sunday Morning - found that they were here at University of Arizona. Went to Art gallery on campus - what a great surprise as panels are displayed with special lighting for each panel which brings out the very best of the paintings. what an artistic feast for the eyes. The panels appear as if they were painted only yesterday. Having seen these precious paintings in person, I found that this DVD affords the viewer the exact  visual experience without the expense of traveling to see them. Also I found the historical information included in the DVD most valuable.",1508112000,,644,4.699115044247788
