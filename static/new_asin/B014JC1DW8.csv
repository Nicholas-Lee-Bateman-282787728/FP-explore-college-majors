7413744,1,B014JC1DW8,"I have to ditto the previous review. This is a total rip-off. We have purchased every DVD that has been put out by Celtic Thunder and are always looking for new material.  They have given this DVD a different name, ""New Voyage""; however, it is an exact duplicate of a previous DVD that we  purchased that was titled ""Voyage II"".",1448841600,17,328,4.45
7413745,1,B014JC1DW8,"My wife and I love Celtic Thunder, and we have bought every DVD issued through Amazon.  The product is always delivered promptly and in good condition.  However, what they have done with this work is an act of deception, because it was issued earlier as just Voyage.  Now they have re-issued it as ""New Voyage"" and up-dated the date to 2015, so we thought it was a new addition, when in fact we have already had this DVD for some time.  I would rate all of the Celtic Thunder videos with five stars (except one), but I do not recommend you buy this unless you have not seen Voyage I or II.",1448064000,29,589,4.232142857142857

7413748,4,B014JC1DW8,"After Voyage II which was my favorite of all the DVDS, New Voyage was a bit of a disapointment because there was nothing new on it.",1467072000,,131,4.076923076923077
7413749,4,B014JC1DW8,"Ill start by reiterating what others here have said: New Voyage is the exact same but retitled DVD as Voyage II.  I read the reasons why, but the new label should have warned buyers about the name-change, since it could easily dupe fans.  I didn't have either of them, so I made certain the songs were the same and the bonus features were the same before ordering, and I chose this one because, although Voyage II is still available here, New Voyage was less expensive.

In these two DVDs, Voyage and New Voyage/Voyage II, Damien and Paul are both gone. Neil Byrne has completed his transition from the band into the line of primary singers, and Emmet Cahill is the new kid filling the second vacancy.  He has a strong, powerful voice that blends well with the other singers in the group.

Which brings me to young Daniel Furlong.  I have mixed feelings about this talented youngsters participation in some of Celtic Thunders established numbers because hes different than anyone who has ever been involved in the group.  Yes, Damien was young, only slightly older than Daniel when the group was formed, but his voice was quite mature and blended well with his older colleagues.  Daniels boy-soprano does not blend at all, and in fact, tends to stand out in a group that's always been known and praised for the vocal blending.

That said, as a solo performer, hes top-notch, and I can well understand why he was invited to tour with the group.  His performance of Youve Got a Friend in Me, is absolutely delightful.  He and Keith played well off one another, and this was one of my favorite numbers on the DVD.

All five of the adult CT members have solo numbers, but the standout performance was Friends in Low Places, sung by Ryan Kelly.  At first glance, it seemed a curious choice of material for him, but it turned out to be an exceptional cover of the classic Garth Brooks song, and I enjoyed the way he engaged the crowd.  He seemed to be thoroughly enjoying this performance, and the audience responded well to it.  For me, this one song alone was worth the price of the DVD.

A peculiar observation that is not related to the quality of the DVD or performances but has me puzzled is that Keith Harkin seemed to be a bit irritable during Place in the Choir.  There is always a lot of hands on shoulders camaraderie by the singers during this song, yet when they were all seated on the steps halfway through, Keith did not seem to want George to touch him, and in fact, gave some pretty harsh looks that I couldn't tell was part of the act or if it was real irritation.

The video quality in this DVD, while not outstanding, is still quite good, although as pointed out by someone else in a review on the former title, there are a few moments where the focus seems a bit blurry.  Also, as with all CT DVDs, there are way, way too many cut-away shots of the audience.  I don't mind a few here and there, but frankly, Id rather be watching the entertainment on the stage than audience reaction.  Ive heard that PBS favors these audience shots, but I do think they could reduce the number of them and still satisfy PBS.  Again, way too many.

The bonus feature is a backstage behind-the-scenes look at the cast, with interviews, and an interesting look at the control room with all the camera angles and directions.  The technical aspects of putting a show like this together is amazing.  Unfortunately, there is no new material  the bonus is merely the second half of the bonus material that is on the original Voyage.

Four stars for this one.  It's a decent DVD, but not my favorite among them as a whole.  And I realize that New Voyage/Voyage II is a continuation of Voyage, but if they're going to have bonus features on both discs, it should be new material, not just the second half of what we've already seen.  There must surely have been enough footage to add some new scenes.",1466899200,4,3889,4.498575498575499
7413750,5,B014JC1DW8,"New Voyage is an exact duplicate of the previous title Voyage, Volume 2. So don't expect any new or different material. If you already have Volume 2 of Voyage there is no need to buy this. I purchased this issue because for some reason my new DVD player would freeze up and not play the old Volume 2 at all. This version was cheaper at Amazon at the time I ordered it and since it is the very same thing I went with it. It plays perfectly and again is the exact same as the older Volume 2 version. The music is fantastic if you like these performers.",1464307200,,550,4.101851851851852

7413753,1,B014JC1DW8,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD if you already have Voyage!  It's the same as the original, with possibly some updates.  When CT changed record labels, they re-issued all their old music with changed titles.  Don't get me wrong because I love CT and would gladly pay for new music, but we haven't seen anything new from them since...I can't even recall.  First it was ""come to this concert because we will be retiring some of your favorites"" and then it was a ""Best of...""  Then came the tiered Fan Club so prime members can help support the creation of new CDs, DVDs - the more you pay per month the better perks you get...Next, they re-released their 2nd Christmas music.  I don't know what's going on with CT - will they EVER come out with new music?  What isn't Sharon Browne telling us?",1455321600,2,779,4.405594405594406

7413755,3,B014JC1DW8,"Love the performances and is entertaining, but the editing leaves much to be desired. There are too many cuts to the audience and by cutting away from the performer you lose the energy they bring and interact with each other and their wonderful band. When George was singing 500 Miles and really getting into it they cut to to crowd and lost the energy he had built up, they also cut to a shot of hands playing the keyboard instead of the main performer on center stage. Love the group and they have great musicians to back them but I expected the DVD to showcase the performers more and to last more the 1 hour with only half the program featured. Next time maybe I will settle for the CD and hear all the songs. The least they could do is to have a Deluxe Version with the complete program or extra features that showcase the wonderful group not the repeat scenes from other DVD's. Performers: 5 Stars  Editing and DVD: 2 Stars",1452384000,,929,4.369942196531792
