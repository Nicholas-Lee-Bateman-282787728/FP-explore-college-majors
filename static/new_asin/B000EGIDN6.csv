No, I'm not a video game person. He just makes a long list for birthdays and Christmas, and I buy some of them.",1368489600,,270,4.018518518518518

8109533,4,B000EGIDN6,"This series is somewhat like Pokemon, but with a more overarching storyline than Pokemon's ""let's just collect more and be the best."" Monster Rancher's story involves a little boy gathering these monster friends to help defeat the main villain. At least he's not self-serving!

Although the animation is a little dated, the characters are very cute (mostly non-frightening to a small child) and the story is easy for them to follow. I think it would keep small children entertained, but older kids would likely wrinkle their nose at the content and animation.

Check your local dollar store, though, because that's where I found the copy I purchased, and there's no need to pay more for shipping than the item.

Note that this is NOT a bootleg. The company Digiview Entertainment buys the rights to older programs SUPER cheap, and then sells the DVDs at the dollar stores. (Old cartoons or movies that nobody renewed the copyright.)",1244160000,,932,4.961538461538462
