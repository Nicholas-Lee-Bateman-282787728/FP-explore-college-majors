2807859,5,B000P2A6CA,"One of my 4 favorite cartoons on Adult Swim, plus harkens back to the ""old School-Metal days"" and theSpinal Tap feel with Humor aimed at adults, not for kids and thats why I like it!",1189987200,3,182,4.228571428571429
2807860,5,B000P2A6CA,"I started watching this show on the Adult Swim website & I was hooked. The story surrounds the world's biggest band Dethklok, which is also one of the world's most valuable resources. The band is composed of spoiled & selfish band members that, despite traveling all over the world, are completely out of touch with the outside world. Most of the story covers parts of each band member's life or past, as well as their struggles to do things that ordinary people do (such as grocery shopping). An overlying story arc is of a mysterious group of world leaders that secretly watch the band, worried that they might fulfill an ancient Sumerian prophecy of an apocalypse.

While the show is predominantly aimed towards men aged 16-30, it's humor, animation, & great storylines appeal to a female audience as well. One of the great in-jokes of the series is the name dropping of metal bands or music product names into the series as background names. If you like Robot Chicken, ATHF, or Venture Bros, you are sure to like this series.",1184803200,9,1029,4.716666666666667

2807862,5,B000P2A6CA,"Metal has sucked outside of the dimmest lowliest scum-infested underground for a long time.  The best bands have been suckerpunched and waylaid to the corners of fandom with the mainstream media sucking their little doll-thumbs to boybands or american idols.  Enter DETHKLOK, secretly members of some of the most badas metal bands out there, who take the hardest most brutal metal out there and condense it down into some of the sickest, hardest, teeth-shattering while you scream along riffs and harmonies ever heard.  Even if metal ist your thing, this bad rules!  They made the first muilti-platinum selling product jingle of all time, for christsakes!

sewn back together wrong.  that's all i'm saying.",1182211200,8,706,5.20353982300885
2807863,5,B000P2A6CA,"Metalocalypse...  I shouldn't really have to say more but I'd love to anyway.  I was channel surfing one night and came across the best show Adult Swim has to offer, and changed the channel.  It was halfway through the episode and I didn't know what was going on.  Later, a buddy of mine told me to watch it.  We watched Dethwater and I was hooked.  This show is great for any fan Metal fan or not.  Now I have introduced to a lot of my friends.  Even ones that can't stand heavy metal, and they can attest to the greatness of this show.  Five friggin stars.  Anyone, who's already a fan of Adult Swim shows, should have no problem getting quickly attached to this show.  Squizgar Squigelf Taller than a Tree, Toki Wartooth not a bumble be, William Murderface, Murderface, Murderface, Pickles the Drummer doodlie doo, ding dong doodlie doo...

2807864,5,B000P2A6CA,"This is a totally metal show. I love it, and so do my friends. This DVD comes out October 2nd. The box art is fully black with the Metalocalypse logo and small font at the bottom saying ""The Metalocalypse has begun..."" The box art is totally metal.",1181088000,3,248,4.297872340425532
2807865,5,B000P2A6CA,"Adult Swim have realy outdone themselves this time.  Who would have thought that a cartoon about a post-apocalyptic death metal band ruling the world would be this good?  Whether they're unleashing swarms of murderous kitties on an unsuspecting populous, summoning giant trolls to ravage the countryside, trying their hand at stand-up comedy (death metal style), or destroying hippies with the combined darkness of thrash and the blues Dethklok always finds a way to keep the mayhem coming.

Featuring the world's fastest guitarist, a bassist who can pull off a wicked solo playing with his johnson, an alcoholic drummer who used to front a bad 80's metal band, an amusingly naive childish rhythm guitarist, and a singer who talks in his growling metal voice all the time and is obsessed with all things brutal, the show is never short of hilarious characters to abuse and the laughs just do not stop.  And I haven't even mentioned Dr. Rockso, the rock 'n roll clown who uses his high Axl Rose-ish voice to screech his catch phrase, ""I DO COCAINE!!!"" at anyone who will listen.

The music is fantastically metal with plenty of double-bass drums, shredding guitar, and nearly incoherent ranting (the subtitles help lots) that will make you bang your head and laugh at the same time.  The episodes are short, to the point, and packed with satire, heavy metal references (a fast food place named Dimmu Burger, anyone?), and shear insanity.  My personal favorite episode involves bassist William Murderface looking for religion after a near-death experience.  The band takes him to a lame christian rock show where several concert-goers and band members wind up dying grisly deaths after a Dethklok member tries to join the fun by starting a mosh pit.  Later, they give devil worshipping a try in what has to be one of the funniest animated scenes (and possibly most true to life) I've ever watched.  Best satanic quote ever: ""Pick up after yourselves; this is a Church of Satan, not a wastepaper basket.""

If you don't see a special features menu when you fire up your DVD's, don't freak out.  The bizarre assortment of features are hidden within the menu and can be found by moving the cursor to highlight different parts of the logo or band members' faces.  There is a tour of Dethklok's compound, Mordhaus, a series of amusing band interviews, a slightly extended Murderface bass solo, a montage featuring the series' more violent moments, and even a little porn.  Then there's the 20 minutes of frontman Nathan Explosion reading Shakespeare; if you can sit through that, you are a bigger fan than I.  My only complaint is that -while the special features are freeballing it- the show itself remains censored.  Sure, the cool guitar noises beat the hell out of the bleeps other shows use, but they should be optional.  Still it's a minor complaint about an awesome set.

 So if you're a metalhead with a sense of humor or are looking for some truly twisted, violent, and laugh-out-loud funny animated entertainment to NOT share with your children then ""Metalocalypse"" is as good as it gets.  And with each episode clocking in at a little over 10 minutes, it's a fantastic way to catch some quick laughs and hear some headbanging good music on the run.  ""Now go forth and DIIIIIEEEE!!!!""",1177027200,128,3286,4.874100719424461

2807968,5,B000P2A6CA,"This is where it all begins,as a metalhead i must say i love this show it is just so funny on so many levels. It is finally time for the metalheads to have something to watch and laugh and spoof about. I know it is on dvd but the first 2seasons don't have the uncensored episodes like 3&4 however the guitar whammy squeal or pinch harmonics instead of the curse word. The episodes that to me are the best are the Religionklok episode,their first episode is great(Curse of Dethklok & other great favorites like Birthdayface,Murdering outside of the Box,Dethkomedy,Dethfam,Performanceklok,Bluesklok,Fatklok,Girlfriendklok,The Metalocalypse has Begun & Dr. Rockso the rock & roll clown. The episodes i didn't mention are great too but my preferances are stated. Great place to start. There pretty much the biggest metal band in the world and there always messing stuff up,killing.people at their live shows every time. Every single episode has death. There is death and gore everywhere while remaining funnier each episode to the next. There is a military team overlooking what the band does and try to have them killed. Without giving anything away the head guy with white hair goes out of this world with his ""abilities,revealed at the end) but there is a general who goes over Silacia(the white haired guy) takes him & the guys out who try & kill the band. The guy Silacia is from a secret order sent to protect the band because there ancient drawings on a wall(theve been coming about for years.
Go get it if your a metal fan. There are guest appearances by musicians in every episode,people are doing voiceovers from King Diamond to George Fisher to Mark Hamill from Star Wars.",1423699200,,1679,4.874125874125874

If you've ever trailed the fence of death metal, this show can actually make you a fan of that style music.
It's outrageous, and filled with situations that are out of this world insane, but all in all.... it could be a very good depiction of people who are so rich, they don't know what to do with all of their money.

Just buy it, and Watch it, and Love it!

That is all

I've followed the shows all these years and This show is a completely Original, animated series that follows a metal band & their triumph over the world. Its gore, humor, art, politics, fantasy creatures, real-life situations (for an infamous metal band), drug & alcohol abuse & Music ALL IN ONE. Its awesome. My particular order was used and the discs great condition as the seller promised, Super danks. purchased in 2009",1355356800,,574,4.989583333333333
2808069,5,B000P2A6CA,"I'm a fairly new fan; I just got into Dethklok last year and I thought I'd buy Season One after breaking my ribs laughing at a Metalocalypse video on Youtube.
 Truly the most life-changing desicion I've made in all of my 16 years on the planet ( and possibly the most metal, too )
 This show is very well-done; the animation is amazing and realistic, the characters and plot are astoundingly original and I thought the usage of real black metal band names in unusual places ( Behemoth Studios, Dimmu Burger anyone? Mordhaus ring a few bells??? )was awesome and as a fan of Cannibal Corpse to the death I was pleased to see ( um, hear anyway ) the appearance of George "" Corpsegrinder "" Fisher's voice in a few episodes. I loved this so much in fact that I watched the whole thing, not just one disc but both discs in one day.
 Now, what I mostly wanted to write this review for was because I understand a lot of people tend to consider this a show for a male audience, which is only correct to a certain degree ( I didn't laugh as hard at the farting as a guy would have... I may have chuckled, but I didn't laugh ) but DO NOT recommend skipping the purchase of this just because you're a girl. Instead consider what's important: If you like metal, if you like gore, if you like the kind of humor that makes you laugh REALLY HARD even though you know you absolutley should NOT be laughing, you would love this and you will not be disappointed, and I would know because I'm a girl too. Seriously, I can't give you a bananna sticker but I can guarantee you you'll love this even more than 100 bananna stickers!",1338336000,,1608,4.282894736842105

I mean one of the purposes of DVDs is having the power to release something uncensored if you so choose, though this is the first time I have seen a show that you would expect to be uncensored on the DVD have all of the censorship that is on TV. Sure, they made the censorship themselves which I respect, but I think they could have at least maybe added it as an option, so if one wanted to view the episodes uncensored they could, but it looks like no uncensored version even exists. If you want to be able to watch the show anytime and the censorship does not bother you, definitely get it.

When I heard of the show's release on DVD, I was excited because I was sure the show, unlike on Cartoon Network, would be uncensored on DVD which is a standard practice nowadays for shows that use strong profanity and violence.  To my disgust, it's presented just like on TV!

That pick squeal guitar noise sounding in place of every profane word is fine on TV but not on DVD!  Sorry, Williams Street, but censorship is a travesty; no money for you, ever.

2808124,4,B000P2A6CA,"As a rivethead of good standing among my brethren, even if I also listen to other musical forms as well, I must say that the news of the existence of this series was welcome relief to me. At last I could look forward to seeing my beloved metal having all sorts of barbs flung at it by those best qualified to do so - metalheads themselves. After all my friends lame attempts at whining about the genre - while they listened intently to either no music at all or music they gleaned from their parents collections from the 60's and 70's - I was heartened to think how a genre so obviously needing insiders to lampoon it would show up in an animated comedy series.

And in many respects this is a successful series. The humour is often of an overall nature, not always specifically of a nature only insiders could understand and in fact I was surprised at how few in jokes there were in the series. This perplexed me as why bother making the series about metal if you aren't going to put a mountain of jibes about the form or insider references in the series. Why not make the series about Dire Straits? Well OK, perhaps that was going too far. But my point is further borne out by the chuckles that ensue whenever an inside joke is put in - I mean Snakes `n' Barrels? Dr Rockso? The names of black metal bands being used for food stores etc?

Furthermore, why on earth would you have the majority of the band hail from the US when for most of the last two decades US hard rock and metal has been pretty dire. Not to mention the two `international' members of the band have accents that take you a few episodes to decipher and Murderface has a mumbling style that also takes a while to get used to. Not great for connectivity chaps.

Of course where this series picks up points is for attempting this at all. And the way in which the guys themselves are often the butt of the jokes is a nice touch and their utter self absorption is a nice comment on the reality TV generation for starters. Not to mention I find it amusing that some really nice riffs have been written for the bands' songs and CD's have been put out of the tunes from the series. Not THAT is funny. Another good point about this series is that there are a few central themes that mean there is a steady narrative throughout. And while character development isn't really the appropriate word the characters do unveil more of themselves to the audience as the series goes on and we find some reasons for their calamitous personality faults.

All of this is also not to mention the simple fact that by doing this as an animation series all sorts of fantasy elements are able to be put into proceedings and this gives the show a totally additional facet than something like Spinal Tap and it means the creators of the series can be far more brutal in their violence and blood letting as these things come to be viewed as cartoon deaths etc as per a Tom & Jerry cartoon.

If you are into hard rock and metal then you really need to acquaint yourself with this series and as an insider I get enough out of it to give it a four star review. But if you aren't into the music the humour isn't of a standard good enough to get this baby home.",1254960000,,3197,4.295190713101161

2808130,4,B000P2A6CA,"When you're the most popular band in music, the world's twelfth-largest economy, and guarantors of all things metal, dealing with such mundane matters as obnoxious relatives, tax issues, and sycophantic fans, along with the occasional killer troll or assassination attempt, can be a real hassle.  However, it makes an ingenious concept for a satirical TV show, and the warped minds behind Adult Swim's Metalocalypse take full advantage of their subject mater, taking aim at heavy-metal excess, celebrity worship, and pop-cultural stupidity through the adventures of animated death-metal supergroup Dethklok.  The show's creators combine an obvious knowledge and appreciation of extreme music with an understanding of its inherent goofiness, and show a genuine affection for their characters even while poking fun at their complete lack of aptitude at anything other than metal.  The tone is enjoyably gonzo throughout, as the satire shares space with deadpan humor and lots of gratuitously over-the-top, lovingly rendered gore; the animation is uniformly first-rate, especially in its attention to detail (the band's enormous helicopter and its forbidding dwellings at Mordhaus are especially impressive); and the music itself is surprisingly well-played and catchy in spite of its humorous intent, although the comic aspect is undercut a little by the near-indecipherability of the lyrics.

For their part, the band members walk a fine line between characters and caricatures, but all provide more than their share of laughs: brutish frontman Nathan Explosion, dog-faced, hate-filled bassist William Murderface, English-challenged Scandinavian guitar virtuosos Skwisgaar Skwigelf and Toki Wartooth, and hard-drinking drummer Pickles.  In spite (or perhaps because) of their massive wealth and fame, the band members are essentially overgrown children, living in a perpetual state of immaturity, ignorance, and self-centeredness, with their no-nonsense manager constantly struggling to limit the fallout of their self-destructive actions.  The show heavily exploits the idea of a band as a dysfunctional family, with the members of Dethklok showing an undeniable bond whether learning the ways of the blues (Bluesklok) or undergoing band therapy (Performance Klok).  The later episodes even provide a few strong character moments, from Toki's attempts to shed his nice-guy image (Dethkids) to Murderface's quest for spiritual fulfillment after a near-death incident (Religionklok) to Nathan Explosion's twisted relationship with a woman who's all wrong for him (Girlfriendklok).

Providing a thread through all the craziness is a top-secret cabal of political, religious, and military leaders, led by a shadowy figure with an eerie voice and a sketchy past, that secretly monitors the band's activities from afar and trots out a never-ending succession of hilarious experts to pontificate on the danger of the latest developments to come out of Mordhaus.  Apparently, in addition to their enormous popularity, Dethklok may be the fulfillment of an apocalyptic Sumerian prophecy, which makes them even more of a threat than their music alone.  Everything culminates in the brilliant concluding episode The Metalocalypse Has Begun, which brings the events of the season to an action-packed, violent head at a live performance in the icy environs of the Baltic Sea.  Its the perfect way to cap the season, and sets the stage for even more insanity to come in season two.

Of course it's one of the best shows evar, or you wouldn't get this DVD. I didn't give this 5 stars because the special features were pointless and really really cheaply animated. They don't add anything to the show, and I think they are actually a detraction, since the comedy is a hacked version of the real show. So just ignore the special features and enjoy the episodes. You can watch them over and over again. And I must quote one of my favorite lines from this season: ""Is this metal frosting? Amazing!"" ""Please do not sample the frosting.

Mind you, a lot of the humor is really for metal fans and those of you that are not into metal music or never have been may not get some of it, writing it off as stupid.  Let me tell you, to the correct audience, this is one of the funniest things ever.

From the song called ""Mermaid Murder"" on the album of metal that was written for fishes (Not for Human ears), to the 80's rock and roll clown Dr. Rockzo (Who does cocaine), I enjoyed every second of this first season and I am eagerly awaiting the second.

Good thing also that this show is one of those 15 minutes per episode shows because I could see the show getting a bit old after watching for 30 minutes or so.

It should fit the area of your screen exactly.  Instead, your DVD player will either stretch it lengthwise with black bars on the top and bottom or it will have black on all four sides depending on your DVD player's settings.  You can probably make your TV or DVD player zoom or stretch to make the picture fit your HDTV, but that's not how it should be.

Perhaps they figured that the type of people who like Metalocalypse are broke metalhead idiots who can't afford nice TVs.  Perhaps they're mostly justified in thinking that, but I'm still mad.

So says Dethklok, in one of Adult Swim's best series ever -- an affectionate, hilarious satire on metal and celebrity. And the first season of ""Metalocalypse"" is crammed with sex, alcohol, gratuitous gore, rock'n'roll clowns, messy death.... and lots and lots of doom metal.

Dethklok is the biggest, darkest, most brutal, most METAL band in the world: the gravel-voiced frontman Nathan Explosion, enraged nihilist William Murderface, the smart guy Pickle, childlike Toki, and haughty elf-like Lothario Skwisgaar. The only ones who don't adore them are a secret Tribunal, who monitor all of Dethklok's goings-on, from their love lives to their celebrity endorsements.

As the series opens, the band is playing a sold-out megaconcert to promote a coffee jingle (""We will make coffee METAL!""). Unfortunately their latest chef accidentally gets dismembered during the concert (""By the power of all that is evil, I command you to awaken and make me a sandwich!""). Since they now have to cook for themselves, a disastrous trip to the ""Food Library"" follows.

But that's not the only problem Dethklok must deal with (or cause): they set a lake troll loose on Finland, record in the Mariana Trench, arrange a ""metal"" birthday party, adopt a porcine child, undergo group therapy, suffer through a fan tour of their Mordor-like citadel, and attempt to cope when Nathan starts dating a shrewish actress.

They have to deal with stand-up comedy, religion, the blues, old band reunions, and celebrity endorsements... as well as Dethklok's ghastly movie debut, the turgidly wooden ""Blood Ocean."" And as they prepare to play their newest album live, two rogue members of the Tribunal decide to finally destroy Dethklok once and for all...

With the exception of the immortal Spinal Tap, it's hard to think of a fictional metal band that is half as good -- or funny -- as Dethklok. ""Metalocalypse"" relentlessly makes fun of metal, even as it gives it an affectionate pat on the back (""Finland is expecting our apology for almost destroying the nation last tour"").

The episodes are only about eleven minutes long, so Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha have to cram the material in -- it's frankly amazing that they can manage even a small plot. There's loads of violent gore (exploding heads, for instance), crazy metal antics and funny scenarios -- when trying to sell their souls to the devil, they manage to drive him away with legalese.

And the dialogue is pretty much genius -- Smalls and Blacha load it with quotables (""That's my bread and butter you're f***ing with""), weird conversations (""In Sweden, underwears is, y'know, the kinky stuff, worn as a fetish...""), and surreal lines (""Candy: tastes like chicken, if chicken was a candy""). Hardly a scene goes by without at least two hilarious lines or exchanges.

Frankly none of the Dethklok members are actually people you'd wanna know -- they're inept, disconnected from reality, kinda sociopathic, and only Pickle seems to have real brains. But they're all entertaining to watch, and over time they actually become endearing, with their own little quirks and oddities. Especially Toki (""Wowie!"").

If you like mature, sophisticated comedies of manners, full of witty repartee... then the first season of ""Metalocalypse"" is not for you. Talk about brutal.",1211155200,,3382,5.143897996357013

My only ciriticism is, given the star-studded line-up of voices (Hetfield, King Diamond, Corpsegrinder, etc), it would've been neat to have some studio footage as an extra, or some ""making of"" kinda stuff.

Every episode is good for a laugh and some headbanging, but a note to the inexperienced: If you're not familiar with the show, don't buy this until you've seen at least one episode on TV. It takes a special kind of person to appreciate the humor.

The DVD, sadly, seems to be poorly put together. There is a warning sticker about the DVD being uncensored and unedited, but a closer look shows that only the special features (which are all hidden) are uncensored. Someone who isn't paying attention could easily be fooled into thinking the whole DVD is free F-bombs and boobies, but the episodes are all presented as they were on television- Just clean enough.

Worse than the slightly misleading sticker, though, are the subtitles. I'm not sure who was hired for this but the subtitles are horrible. This is particularly true during songs, when the lyrics are commonly incorrect or even missing altogether. Also, the censorship in the subtitles is intermittent. On one occasion, you might see ""f--"", whereas on another, the subtitles spell the word out for you. This isn't really a problem (You shouldn't have kids watching anyways), but it makes the DVD look messy.

If you want your Metalocalypse with exactly one hundred beers and no commercials, this is perfect for you. If you're looking for something special, you may be disappointed.",1198800000,2,1442,4.783132530120482

This series is pretty unfunny overall. If you're into extreme deathmetal then the soundtrack to this series will be great for you. There really isn't much else to say about the series as it stands.

My only problem with this series (aside from the lack of real humor) is how it's billed. Right on the front of the DVD packaging it says ""WARNING: UNCENSORED""...blah, blah, blah... The entire series from beginning to end is still 100% censored. The only thing that qualifies as uncensored is the fact that they say ""dil--"". You can fill in the blanks there. Other than that...it's still very much censored. Black boxes, pixelated areas, and sounds in place of curse words.

When you really get down to it, the series just isn't funny. It's trying so hard to be funny, but the content just doesn't make you laugh. The only time I laughed while watching this was in the first scene aboard the helicopter where they spoke to the chef. Even that scene wasn't much of a funny ""haha"" laugh, more of a slight chuckle.

Like most people who will buy this DVD set, I was looking forward to owning Season 1 when it came out. Initially I was disappointed and wrote a review to that end.

Then I discovered the hidden content.

I won't tell you what it is or spoil it in any other way, but I will say that every thing I was bummed about not being included almost certainly is.

But when a DVD set is released, even those bonds can and should be discarded. It unacceptable for a DVD set.

2808295,3,B000P2A6CA,"My review is specifically for the DVD release.  I had already seen every episode multiple times (tivo'd it) and think it's a great show.

The problems I have with the set are:
1. There is no direct way to access any ""extra features.""  Somebody said there were ""easter egg"" bloopers but I haven't seen them yet.  I wish I could just get to them directly, in an easy to understand menu.  Since I've already seen all the episodes, I mainly bought this for the extra features (yeah, I'm that big of a fan).

2. The subtitles are wrong for the ""deththeme"" and various other spots (that I've noticed so far).  This makes me doubt that the rest of the set has accurate subtitles.  It looks like whoever did the subtitles searched google for the lyrics for the ""deththeme"" instead of getting them directly from the creators of the show, because I've seen that common mis-translation before on google.

3. The 2.0 audio mix is censored, so if you don't have a 5.1 set up you're out of luck.  If the 5.1 mix is censored (which I don't know because I haven't watched it through a 5.1 setup yet) then the set is 100% censored.

If you don't have any other way to see the show, this is a set worth getting.  But if you can tivo it or watch it on the website, the set really doesn't have much extra to make it worth it.",1191542400,7,1305,4.281632653061225
2808296,5,B000P2A6CA,"Adult Swim never ceases to amaze me.  It seems as if nearly every new show to debut on the Cartoon Network's late night lineup pushes the limits of cable TV animation.  Case in point, Metalocalypse; a show about death/doom metal supergroup Dethklok, and the metal laced path of insanity and destruction they leave in their wake.  Led by frontman Nathan Explosion (who never speaks without his death metal growl and is always looking for new forms of brutality), Dethklok's mission of global domination finds the band slaughtering their fans, conjuring up a giant troll, taking on the comedy scene, and painfully being re-united with their families among others.  Bloody, brutal, loaded with visual gags, and insanely hilarious throughout, Metalocalypse is a true treat that celebrates and satires the metal scene.  There's plenty to love, including great, pumping music and some voice work from legendary metal screamer King Diamond, and even Metallica's James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett.  All in all, picking up this DVD set is a no brainer for fans of the show, and while it may be an acquired taste for some, make no mistake that you'll get plenty of enjoyment from the brutal boys of Dethklok.",1191456000,7,1196,5.015151515151516

There is no commentary, music videos, making of, Just these Easter Eggs: Disc 1: there are ""bloopers""  Disc 2: there are interviews with the band already available on the AS website and a tour of Mordhaus.

So says Dethklok, in one of Adult Swim's best series ever -- an affectionate, hilarious satire on metal and celebrity. And the  first season of ""Metalocalypse"" is crammed with sex, alcohol, gratuitous gore, rock'n'roll clowns, messy death.... and lots and lots of doom metal.

Dethklok is the biggest, darkest, most brutal, most METAL band in the world: the gravel-voiced frontman Nathan Explosion, enraged nihilist William Murderface, the smart guy Pickle, childlike Toki, and haughty elf-like Lothario Skwisgaar. The only ones who don't adore them are a secret Tribunal, who monitor all of Dethklok's goings-on, from their love lives to their celebrity endorsements.

As the series opens, the band is playing a sold-out megaconcert to promote a coffee jingle (""We will make coffee METAL!""). Unfortunately their latest chef accidentally gets dismembered during the concert (""By the power of all that is evil, I command you to awaken and make me a sandwich!""). Since they now have to cook for themselves, a disastrous trip to the ""Food Library"" follows.

But that's not the only problem Dethklok must deal with (or cause): they set a lake troll loose on Finland, record in the Mariana Trench, arrange a ""metal"" birthday party, adopt a porcine child, undergo group therapy, suffer through a fan tour of their Mordor-like citadel, and attempt to cope when Nathan starts dating a shrewish actress.

They have to deal with stand-up comedy, religion, the blues, old band reunions, and celebrity endorsements... as well as Dethklok's ghastly movie debut, the turgidly wooden ""Blood Ocean."" And as they prepare to play their newest album live, two rogue members of the Tribunal decide to finally destroy Dethklok once and for all...

With the exception of the immortal Spinal Tap, it's hard to think of a fictional metal band that is half as good -- or funny -- as Dethklok. ""Metalocalypse"" relentlessly makes fun of metal, even as it gives it an affectionate pat on the back (""Finland is expecting our apology for almost destroying the nation last tour"").

The episodes are only about eleven minutes long, so Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha have to cram the material in -- it's frankly amazing that they can manage even a small plot. There's loads of violent gore (exploding heads, for instance), crazy metal antics and funny scenarios -- when trying to sell their souls to the devil, they manage to drive him away with legalese.

And the dialogue is pretty much genius -- Smalls and Blacha load it with quotables (""That's my bread and butter you're f***ing with""), weird conversations (""In Sweden, underwears is, y'know, the kinky stuff, worn as a fetish...""), and surreal lines (""Candy: tastes like chicken, if chicken was a candy""). Hardly a scene goes by without at least two hilarious lines or exchanges.

Frankly none of the Dethklok members are actually people you'd wanna know -- they're inept, disconnected from reality, kinda sociopathic, and only Pickle seems to have real brains. But they're all entertaining to watch, and over time they actually become endearing, with their own little quirks and oddities. Especially Toki (""Wowie!"").

If you like mature, sophisticated comedies of manners, full of witty repartee... then the first season of ""Metalocalypse"" is not for you. Talk about brutal.",1191110400,15,3383,5.143897996357013

2808302,5,B000P2A6CA,"Metalocalypse is probably one of the greatest satire projects for metal EVER!!!  Yet, similar to Spinal Tap, the music is brilliantly stunning.  With a combination like this, it's no wonder that it did as well as it did on Cartoon Network.  So it doesn't matter if you are male or female.  It doesn't mater if you like Metal or Classical.  As long as you have a sense of humor, and an open mind this is one of the best cartoon series you could ever watch.  Let's also not forget to mention it's as unique as you can get.  Never have I seen a cartoon that was music based be so original in story.  So if you are now interested in buying Season One, and you have read not just mine, but everyone's reviews.  I think it's clear to say, GO BUY IT NOW!!!!!",1190505600,7,751,4.195804195804196

8188584,4,B000P2A6CA,I bought this as a gift for someone who really enjoys the show. I'm not a huge fan of the show but it did have some creative cracked out moments. So as far as the 4 stars goes that's a mixture of my personal feelings and the person who received the gift. I would provide a 3 star rating based on my feelings about the show. My friend would provide 5 stars. If I was to purchase this series again I would look for a blu-ray copy but it would be a gift not for myself.,1522454400,,466,3.8645833333333335
