8380171,4,B002TJ9DYO,I mostly use this DVD as a review tool and so far its worked wonderfully. It can be a bit campy at times and the filter effects in the ending demo videos are obnoxious but its definitely a useful learning tool.,1361577600,,210,4.146341463414634
8380172,2,B002TJ9DYO,I would give it a 1 but the reason I gave it a 2 is there was bout one trick I learned from it. Very unstructured teaching and most of the lessons I wouldn't ever use during spinning.,1359072000,,183,3.8421052631578947
