8530479,5,B008UBURMM,"This is a wonderful deal. I bought them separately, one by one, and paid so much more. I wish I'd realized I wanted them all and had found this set first. My grandsons, 3 & 6, adore Peter & the Wolf and Alice. About to show them Beatrix, which may be less exciting after the first two, but I wanted to see what it was like and am now a big fan of the Royal Ballet. The Nutcracker has been my husband's favorite for years and I enjoy different versions of it. Children don't have to be in ballet to enjoy these - especially Peter & the Wolf. Wonderful at just 30 minutes and narrated. Alice is 2 hours long and can/should be watched in segments - but it is captivating. Especially for the 3 year old.",1499126400,,699,4.109489051094891
8530480,5,B008UBURMM,"I bought this for my ballet-loving 7 year old son and his 4 year old sister.  We watch a lot of ballets on YouTube but you can't get any complete Royal Ballet productions for free online.  So I forked over the money.  I ordered directly from the Royal Ballet because it was less expensive than Amazon. We've watched the ballets numerous times (I'd say on average we watch 2-3 ballets a week, mostly on YouTube, but these definitely come into the rotation frequently).

You can watch the best bits of Alice on YouTube.  To be fair, those really are the best bits so don't be expecting the entire ballet to be that phenomenal.  But the whole thing is creative, artistic, a little edgey in the ballet world.

We can't decide which is our favorite production of Nutcracker but it's either this one or the one from EuroArts Channel on Youtube published on Nov 29, 2014, From the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg, December 2012.  The kids like the storyline aspect of this one...it's a little less disjointed and honestly is pretty darn romantic (which makes those pax de deaux more fun).

My kids already have a ""thing"" for Peter and the Wolf so it was probably their favorite of the set.  It's short, only 30 minutes, and is danced by the students of the Royal Ballet school, which made it extra fun because my son could really relate to them (especially when we watched the interviews in the extra material.  Hearing the little girl say that ""everyone dreams of being lifted by him"" was really cute).  In the ballet, all the main scenery is danced as well (the trees, the meadow, the water...and they are pretty awesome, especially the water IMO).

I still haven't gotten over the fact they actually made the Beatrix Potter characters look like the actual characters in the book and managed to dance like that (imagine dancing with a squirrel tail).  I'd recommend reading the books first (or listen to the audio book but ideally see the illustrations too).  People have commented that the dancing is simpler but we found it charming and fun.  Leaping squirrels are just so squirrelish and leaping rats are just ridiculous. :-)

I'd highly recommend this set for any ballet-loving children.  We're ordering the next set (Fairy Tale Ballets) in the next couple months.",1481414400,,2266,4.7226463104325695
8530481,5,B008UBURMM,"The four dvds each have a booklet about the ballet; The Beatrix Potter ballet is very cute for young children the costumes are adorable but the dancing is more basic and each segment is mostly about the characters more than the tales. Peter and the Wolf was my least favorite because the narration is throughout the ballet but it is interesting because instead of having sets they had the dancers be the lake, meadow, and wall. The Nutcracker I had seen before and I love having my own copy. Alice in Wonderland is my favorite it was an interesting take on the tale and the Queen of Hearts was amazing at scaring the other dancers while making the audience laugh. The Mad Tapper (Hatter) tapped dances while trying to stuff the Door Mouse in a giant tea cup and the Cheshire cat was a black and white giant puppet that looks as if he is floating around the stage.",1448409600,,863,4.433962264150943
8530482,5,B008UBURMM,"Wonderful for adults and children....I bought it for my grand kids [ages 9 & 6] ...I had seen Alice in Wonderland, at my local big screen theater and loved it...was surprised the whole production was available for children. The children loved it and they watched it in 2 sessions. I borrowed the disc and showed it to several friends in my Senior community..Again a success. The other ballets were very good as well..",1408406400,3,417,4.726027397260274
8530483,4,B008UBURMM,"This is a very nice set of very well choreographed ballets for children. My nine-year old daughter adores it, and looks at the different ballets over and over again.",1358380800,7,165,4.724137931034483
