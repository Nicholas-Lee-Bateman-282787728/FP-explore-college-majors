My son has cerebral palsy and it has been so helpful to us for him to communicate with us. I also own a preschool and my children love watching these videos and learning new signs.,1423440000,,307,4.4035087719298245

I am enjoying using these to improve my skills.",1331424000,,302,4.472727272727273
