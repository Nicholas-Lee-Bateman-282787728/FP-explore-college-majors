7384765,5,B014614S3S,Excellent movie following riders across the USA on the TransAmerica bike route.  The director allows them to share their experiences and feelings. Well done!,1445299200,,157,5.541666666666667
7384766,5,B014614S3S,"Fantastic film. Once again from Mike Dion. He knows how to do cycling films. Whether you like to ride 10 miles or 100 miles or 1000 miles, you will enjoy this journey. Even if you do not ride, you're likely to enjoy.",1445299200,,216,4.166666666666667
7384767,5,B014614S3S,"A gritty and enjoyable documentary of the real experience of these ultra extreme cyclists, racing for the pure goal to finish.  This movie is brilliantly filmed & produced by Dion's crew across the beautiful backdrop of America.  Watch the extras!  Then... watch Ride the Divide.",1445299200,,279,5.155555555555556
7384768,5,B014614S3S,"The scenery will inspire you to go do something outside on this rock we call the world!  The story will make you feel the emotional roller coaster of an endurance racer as the fatigue of racing this amount of distance impacts each one. Mike's team did a superb job of capturing the race, Americana at it's best, exquisite cinematography throughout and finally, delivering a film like no other.",1444521600,,393,4.779411764705882
7384798,4,B014614S3S,Fantastic documentary!  Great videography and soundtrack.  Love the rivalry between Juliana and the Italians.,1503100800,,109,6.714285714285714
7384799,5,B014614S3S,"Great documentary with good story telling esp. on the late Mike Hall and the female cyclist-Juliana, who should inspire more female to participate in the sports and extreme challenge as such.  The documentary is well chronicled, shot, and produced which makes it enjoyable to watch.  While the race/ challenge itself is inspiring by itself, the behind-the-scene story (extra section) being told by the riders outside of the race certainly add to the power to inspire the audience.  In future, I hope the film-maker could include a children friendly version (condensed version) to inspire our kids, I much rather the school teacher share this kind of video/story in school/ afterschool than showing any fairy tales or whatever cartoons, imagine a nice post-viewing conversations of how we are dealing with our struggles...",1502755200,,821,5.3
7384800,5,B014614S3S,"As with Mike Dion's Ride the Divide piece, this video was at once inspiring and introspection-inducing. From cycling serving as a vehicle for self-discovery and healing to a source of empowerment and simple enjoyment, those highlighted here present such a wide range of perspectives that I feel most anyone can relate.  You don't need to ride 4,000 miles to ""get it"". I was also struck by the choice of music accompanying the storyline...again, like the Divide piece... the music is absolutely spot on.  I found myself  amazed and saddened, however, by watching Mike Hall in action, knowing that he is no longer with us.  RIP to a great rider, and kudos to a great movie!",1501977600,,671,4.808695652173913
7384801,5,B014614S3S,"I think I've watched this documentary about five times already. What a beautiful piece of filmmaking. The cinematography is amazing and the dynamics between the racers makes it feel like you're watching an action movie. There's drama, humor, and heartbreak. Especially since the great Mike Hall was killed recently and appears as the 'star' of this documentary. Watching this inspired me to buy a road bike and get into bikepacking with my friend. We even hope to try the Trans Am on our own one day. Life looks better from the saddle!",1501286400,,535,4.826086956521739

7384806,5,B014614S3S,"Great film, great music, great personalities. On winter days when I'm not feeling like training, putting this on inspires me to get on the spin bike and ride.

And it makes for an awesome tribute to Mike Hall.",1493596800,2,209,4.5
7384807,5,B014614S3S,"This film is a must see if you come from any sort of cycle-touring background, or if you are a club cyclist that wants to have a peek at the world of endurance, long-distance challenge riding. It's a well-made film. In my opinion, it is for cycle touring what 'Long Way Round' (Ewan McGregor/Charley Boorman) is for Motorcycle touring.

This film will inspire the next generation of long-distance cycle riders and adventurers.

The soundtrack is perfectly suited and enhances the reportage style filming. A lot of effort has evidently gone in to the editing, and it's a great piece of travelogue film-making.

The characters the film portrays bring a gritty sense of humour to the film. We get inside the mind-set of some record holding endurance riders, including Mike Hall, Juliana Buhring and Jason Lane. The low-tech, unsupported nature of the ride itself is refreshing in a world where cycling, like so many other low-tech pursuits are having their mystery and adventure sucked out of them by technology, (over) support and big money.",1487635200,,1039,4.994219653179191

7384820,5,B014614S3S,"My husband and I rode the Trans Am in 2015 and were amazed to find out it was also a race - the 2nd year by then. We met our first racer in Hamilton Montana - our day 25 on trail and his day 5! We finally acquired the Inspired To Ride DVD and have watched it dozens of times as well as all the extras (interviews and such). We've shared it with non-riders who have also been inspired. We don't plan to race the Trans Am, but faithfully follow the blue dots of the race every year now. Love it, love it, LOVE IT!

7384824,2,B014614S3S,Disappointing. Had no idea who everyone was. Julianna is mentioned heavily in all the marketing but doesn't show up that much. Less camera time for the directors and producers would give more time to character build some of the riders.,1480896000,,235,4.9

Ninety minutes of breathtaking scenery, great soundtrack and one hell of a ride.

7384859,5,B014614S3S,I have bought all of Mike Dion's movies and have enjoyed every one of them and I've watched each one many times.  Its the production and music and how he captures the struggles that the riders go through as well as the characters that they meet along the way.  I'm already looking forward to his next movie.,1460246400,,307,4.368421052631579

Why aren't we periodically seeing the spread of gps dots of all the riders to see comparison.  The whole Italian nonsense,,,,,,  and the music, excrutiating,,,,I think it missed the mark in capturing the spirit and hardships by focusing too much on just a few.",1459555200,,360,4.852459016393443

7384865,5,B014614S3S,"Everything about this film, including the riders, the technology on both sides of the camera, the scenery, the insights, the humor and the soundtrack are top notch.  How is this possible?  A few people with meager resources stage a near-impossible test of man and machine, and then take us along as people who seem much like you and me rise to the occasion.  I can't think of a Hollywood production that captures triumph over adversity with such spare authenticity.

We have here several examples of people from modest backgrounds who demonstrate world-class ability, and not just in bike racing.  It suggests a question that one of the films well-spoken stars puts this way: I wonder how many people have hidden potential they were possibly born with and never discover.  This film inspires viewers to tackle the seemingly insurmountable challenges in their own lives.",1458086400,10,869,5.041958041958042

The rides are real people who ride because they love cycling. They are likeable, strong people with a passion for always being on the move on their bikes. They are sting as they battle fatigue, hunger, mechanical bike problems, wind, cold, hills - over and over, state by state. Could I do this? That's the question that viewers ask themselves as they watch Inspired to Ride.

7384911,5,B014614S3S,"Went to see this documentary the other night and wasn't disappointed.  In the spirit of Bicycle Dreams, this movie is equally as good, but is a different experience.  The riders seemed to be having more fun, which made the watching all that much better.  The sub-plot of the rivalry between Juliana Buhring and the Italian riders was compelling and left the whole theater cheering (for the eventual victor)!

This documentary has all of the drama of a feature film, and phenomenal scenery as the racers make their way from Oregon to Virginia.  Those who are avid cyclists will enjoy it immensely.  You may think anyone willing to enter a bike race across country without support vehicles or rest stops is insane.  In reality, it's no different than someone climbing Mount Everest or swimming the English Channel.  The camera crew follows several of the cyclists throughout the race, and you can hear for yourself their ambitions, motivations and frustrations.  It's unlike any other movie experience.",1454544000,,666,5.064220183486238

4233 miles
10 states
Unsupported
No stages
No checkpoints
Starting in Oregon, over the Rocky Mountains, through the great plains, past the Appalachians finishing in York Town, Virginia.
The film follows the first edition of the race, as these adventure cyclists take on everything that meets them on the journey. Their only schedule is their own, with their mind becoming their own worst enemy.
Averaging 250-300 miles a day, the endurance on display is incredible. Often riding through the night or grabbing only a handful of hours sleep, its a experiment in balancing miles with fatigue.
The film is brilliant, showing each competitors own story, their own trials and tribulations, as well as their lighter moments. All entering have their own goals and this is displayed.
Unlike any other race I can think of, other than Park Run, there is no prize money or winners spoils. Only the knowledge that they have achieved their goal.
As endurance films go, this is a beauty. It doesn't detract from the competitors and tells their own stories in their own unique way. Since downloading the film, I have watched in 3 times..... within 48 hours! It is captivating, motivating and inspiring.

This movie is about people, genuine people who love cycling whether competitive or touring. Mike Dion and Hunter Weeks, your movies bring to light the human spirit, adventure in all it's aspects. In doing so it reminds us that living is done outside away from the office and the TV. When we do this we see our perceptions change and that the world is bigger and more beautiful than we could ever imagine. Thank you for making this film and for the other films you have made. When I watch Ride The Divide, Reveal The Path, and now Inspired to Ride, I'm reminded and invigorated to get outside and ride when the weather permits and to ride on my trainer when I can't get outside. Everyone should see this film, whether you cycle or not, simply a great film.",1449619200,,884,4.331325301204819

I'm a cyclist who loves pretty much all things cycling. But you certainly don't need to love or even like cycling to be amazed at what these riders accomplished. It's not a ride around the block, a short trip to the store for milk, the Tour de France, or even the Race Across America. It's just coast-to-coast powered by legs and heart (brains, maybe not so much).

This is far and away the best movie about riding a bike that I've ever seen.  I saw it in Dallas at the Texas Theatre and bought two copies of the Blu-Ray afterwards (one for me, one as a retirement gift for a riding buddy of mine).

7384957,5,B014614S3S,"The film was compelling, sat on edge of my seat. Amazing scenery, elements, murphy's law in action, teetering emotions, physical demands, and more all captured and presented in an effective manner.",1447891200,,197,5.387096774193548
7384968,5,B014614S3S,"I saw this in Helena, MT and had the pleasure of hearing first hand from Mike Dion details about the race, difficulties in filming the racers and still not provide any support to them.  The accounts in the film of the endurance struggle, their pain and methods they used to keep their focus on the ride are just amazing.  Mike and his team have done a superb job in capturing the riders' story and presented it with beautiful visual style.
This is a must have and a keeper and will inspire you to push yourself in life!",1447804800,,519,4.34020618556701
7384969,5,B014614S3S,A great film about some amazing (possibly insane) human beings. I haven't ever been as inspired to get on my bike as after this film. A definite must-watch for the cyclists in your life.,1447632000,,186,4.5
7384970,5,B014614S3S,"Another fantastic film by Mike Dion and his awesome crew.  I almost ran out the door to attack the Trans-AM route, but realized I had to work on Monday in 2 days.  I felt defeated for a moment till I realized I was unprepared for the adventure.  So over the weekend I watched it again and the bonus features on the individual riders and the gear prep video's.  And a list was started.  The Bike Packing List.  I have some stuff suitable but a lot of my outdoors gear is car camping focused.  And I set a goal.  Not to race the whole race, but just to ride a few states of it in the next 2 years.  Plan is this summer is to go down to VA Beach and ride the first 2 or 3 days westbound.  Then in 2017 to make it out for the western start and ride the first 3-4 states east bound.  Those to me were the most beautiful sections of the video.  Sure the plains are beautiful in a different way, but it's the mountains and views that are calling me for now.  For now I'm out riding and dreaming, and enjoying life.  And buying some new gear.  :)  Blu-ray video looked awesome.  Soundtrack was solid too.",1447632000,,1096,4.070422535211268
7384971,5,B014614S3S,"I had a chance to see this as a free preview.  I was enthralled.  It was a perfect mix of racing, scenery, and conversations with the locals.  Well-paced, great cinematography, wonderful soundtrack.

For those of you familiar with the story of the Tour de France cyclist welding his fork back together mid-race, you will enjoy a modern-day version of that in this film.

I am inspired to ride, but, dear heavens, I have no desire to do this event.  It made the pains of doing so sufficiently evident.  I am inspired, however, to be more like Newton Bike Shop.  See the movie and you'll understand.

Even as I type this, it strikes me how much the kindness of strangers plays into the experience of the racers.",1447632000,2,709,4.563492063492063
7384972,5,B014614S3S,"Walked into the movie without knowing anything about it, and after watching it I've been recommending it to everyone, and it's a source of motivations for myself to get out and ride more.
It compiles the stories of a number of the riders that participated in an unsupported race across the USA, all sharing the same passion but with different reasons to participate.
Amazing cinematography and a great music selection really add up.
Totally recommended!",1447286400,,453,5.053333333333334
7384973,5,B014614S3S,"Wonderful documentary of an amazing event. For those who think the Tour de France is the ultimate grueling event, well, it pales in comparison. The film captures the drama of the race, the foibles, vulnerabilities, and the humor of the riders, with spectacular scenery and great music as a backdrop. You don't have to be a racer or even a cyclist to enjoy the film, as well as to appreciate both the participants and the documentarians. Not to miss! You may not want to try this event after viewing it, but you'll want to hop on the pedals all the same.",1447286400,,553,4.485148514851486

This is a beautifully told and photographed tale of the human spirit. Whether you ride a bike or not, this film is gripping from start to finish. These cyclists, riding for no prize money, with no support, across the entire United States, are beyond inspiring. And the filmmakers did an outstanding job of catching the heart and spirit of several individual stories. The photography is excellent, as is the editing and music. One of my favorite films of the year, documentary or otherwise.",1447200000,10,683,4.652892561983471
7385003,5,B014614S3S,"What can I say that the brand new cycling documentary by some great filmmakers won't say for itself? Well, for starters, the planning it took to make this film was stunning, the brilliant minds behind it love cycling and film making and Inspired to Ride will not only inspire you to ride but impress you beyond words.

This film captures the heart of endurance cycling in a way few get to experience. Following virtually the same path as the Trans America Trail from Oregon to Virginia, this race is for the very special cyclists who don't mind hurting each day they ride. And Inspire To Ride will put you right in the saddle with these men and women. Directors Mike Dion and Hunter Weeks and their crew have produced a perfect followup to their earlier cycling docs and you will watch this again and again.

Cycling is such a personal sport, so it was nice to see the individual stories of the different riders unfold for us through the music.  In addition, the accompanying music was perfectly matched.  I will watch this again, and again.  Highly recommend this move to both cyclists and non-cyclists.  All will enjoy.",1446595200,,485,4.714285714285714

Mike Dion once again takes us on a journey with hard-core athletes who love to ride their bikes and can endure hardships that would render most of us into jelly.  Taking us into several of the personal histories and competitive issues between entrants was enlightening and entertaining as well.
