8102580,5,B000DN5VIA,"This is one of Andy Lau's best movies, and Andy should've won an award for it. Andy's performances are often hit-and-miss, but I am surprised at how good he is in this film. The supporting cast are good too, especially the younger version of Andy.

The movie's beautifully shot, and is very effective at evoking the audience's emotions. I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it, but the treatment of the story is very different from Hollywood films. I wonder why Hollywood chooses not to use such an effective tool.

Buy it, see it, with friends, family, movie going doesn't get better than this.",1242691200,4,603,4.679245283018868
8102581,5,B000DN5VIA,"I was very surprised by this movie. I didn't know what I was going to see except that it had good actors like Andy Lau in it. By the way, the plot summary at Amazon spoils the movie just a bit. Don't read it if you haven't already.

At any rate the execution of the film was very good. For some reason it reminded me a little of Edward Scissorhands. I don't know why.

The story is good. For an American, the ending is unexpected. This is not a formula movie. There is a lot of Confucian philosophy and Chinese advice in this film. It is really a very happy film in a way. The film focuses on people dealing with their rather serious traumas without blowing up cars or hurting people. The film has a message and an unexpected but quite well concluded story line.

The movie stands for itself. I recommend watching it. I also recommend buying it because it is one that is worth watching more than once and sharing with family and friends.",1180310400,2,937,4.2824858757062145
8102582,4,B000DN5VIA,"Remember when you were a child and wished you were an adult instead?  In ""Wait `Til You're Older"" this wish comes true for one little boy.  Kwong is a troubled kid who is used to running away from home and when he his attempts failed, he is intent on making life difficult for his stepmother. He has never accepted ""the Bitch"", as he secretly has nicknamed his stepmother, because he believes she was the one who wrecked his parents' marriage and caused his mother's death.  One day, Kwong runs into a stranger who confides to the boy that he has perfected a serum that will make seedlings grow into trees in one day.  It doesn't take long for Kwong to realize that the stranger's serum is the key to his freedom.  Once he is an adult, his father cannot force him to go back home and he would not have to live under the same roof with the Bitch any more.

Andy Lau plays Kwong as an adult and he gives a wonderful performance as he conveys both the vulnerability of the child still in him and the wisdom of a man far beyond his years.  Perhaps the best thing about the movie is that it doesn't fall for a typical Hollywood ending where once Kwong the adult has learned his lesson can magically go back to being a child and the family lives happily ever after. ""Wait `Til You're Older"" dares to differ and instead it takes us to a bittersweet and touching resolution in which Kwong learns the truth about his parents' relationship, faces the consequences of his actions and comes to terms with death. ""Wait `Til You're Older"" is a drama that is not shy to remind us about the transient nature of life and the need for family unity.  As to its main character, outgrowing the self-centeredness of childhood in order to become a responsible and caring person is what growing up is about and Kwong finally succeeds at that.",1148169600,6,1818,4.422155688622754
8102583,5,B000DN5VIA,"I decided to watch this film because I had no other thing to do that night. The result? Wow. Sniff. Sigh.

The story is about Kwong, who doesn't fully understand things as a 12-year-old. One day he meets a man who has a potion that can speed up life process. He snatches this potion and he accidentally drops it, mixing it with his blood. The next day he becomes a 20-year-old man, and that's when he starts understanding things that were never really clear to him. He finds out every thing that has happened to him has reasons, and these reasons are in fact, valid.

Certainly a touching and moving tale about discovering the answers to life's conundrums, this film is deserving of your undivided attention! It is thought-provoking in a not so dramatic sense, since it's sometimes funny as well. Nice cinematography too.",1146355200,5,821,4.694444444444445
