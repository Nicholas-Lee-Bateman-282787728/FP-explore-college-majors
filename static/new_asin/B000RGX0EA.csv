8200663,5,B000RGX0EA,"I have no idea why they canned this show. This is, quite honestly, some of the best t.v. I've seen in years. It also has to be the most genuine reality show I've ever seen. Mr. T is incredibly engaging as himself, a genuinely warm and honest human being, interlaced inexplicably with his inherent T-nacity. Unlike other reality show fools who try and feign sincerity (and fail miserably), T exudes a valid, righteous authenticity that just cannot be faked. (Suckas may try, but they won't measure up.)

Along the way, you also get these great reactions from the people he's helping. When T talks, they don't listen. (At first.) Then, he lays down the wisdom as only he can... and they look at him like he's got lobsters crawling out of his mohawk.

(Arguing family each waiting for Mr. T to take their side)
Mr. T: You know what the biggest room of any house is?
(Family shuts up and shakes their heads)
Mr. T: It's the room for improvement!
(Family looks at him completely bewildered)

To each dilemma, the man himself puts forth his best problem solving skills and really seems to honestly try to get his charges to help themselves. He works with them to inspire them through open dialogue, common sense and heart felt sincerity. He doesn't just want to make money by being there or throw his fame around. He compassionately works to make a difference, even when it seems to the viewer that he might be better off putting his size 13.5 red, white and blue Converse up their butts.

Are the people's problems solved permanently? Probably not, but hopefully they now at least have a sense of inspiration and willingness to tackle their issues from different angles. Some follow ups from the help-ees would have been nice to see how they got on later after their T-therapy.

Mr. T also KNOWS that he's Mr. T and, as such, is completely self-depracating and a real hoot. His rhyme/verse reflections at the end of each episode are totally worth the price of admission all on their own.

If I had to have a television celebrity help me out, I'd take Mr. T over Dr. Phil any day of the week.

I love this show. I wish more episodes were on the way. Sadly, that's not the case.

It's too bad that the fools that be, managed to put an end to this show for Mr. T.

I don't hate them. I pity them. I PITY them!",1345766400,2,2301,4.45952380952381
8200664,4,B000RGX0EA,"Having not seen Mr. T on the screens in a long time, (he's obviosly not as well known down here in Down Under as he is in the States)only to have him pop up in a tank in a hilarious 'Snickers' commercial made me keen to get a dose of The T. I really enjoyed this series.  It doesn't go for long, but I guess the man likes to be to the point!  He encounters people with various problems and helps them out in his own unique way.  It's true, he doesn't really put anyone down.  It seems more about education than humiliation.  At the same time there's some good laughs in it.  Recommended.",1197676800,4,587,4.105263157894737
8200665,5,B000RGX0EA,"I can't stress just how wonderful ""I Pity the Fool"" is.  The show is pure gold.  Mr. T. uses his kind intellect and powerful motivational tools to help families and teach valuable lessons.  A must-watch for all.  Flawless television.",1193097600,2,233,4.897435897435898
8200666,5,B000RGX0EA,"This six episode season took the T-riffic 80's action star and put him in ""fish out of water"" scenarios.

During each episode Mr. T helps someone (a family, a dance school, a car dealership, etc) who has a problem.

Mr. T proves himself to be an entertaining motivator constantly spouting pithy quotes... and not pitying anyone.

The real treat about this series is that Mr. T comes away looking great... and so does everyone else. Unlike every other reality show this show never tries to portray the subjects as jerks or morons.

Get this set, watch these episodes and share them with everyone from grandma to your youngest child.",1182902400,7,631,4.761467889908257
