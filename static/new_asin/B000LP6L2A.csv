2711655,4,B000LP6L2A,"The post-EXORCIST 70s produced a variety of quirky, old-fashioned horror films with big name stars whose careers were winding down but who were happy to still be working and who added a touch of class to the proceedings. PSYCHIC KILLER with Jim Hutton, TOURIST TRAP with Chuck Connors and SHOCK WAVES with John Carradine and Peter Cushing immediately come to mind. And then there's THE MANITOU.

I saw this movie when it first came out in 1978 and thoroughly enjoyed it. There's something for everyone here... black magic, Native American lore, cool 1970s furnishings (check out Tony Curtis' pad -er- apartment), possession, a seance, demonic birth and a STAR TREK like finish. It's like a summing up of the themes of 1970s horror films with a few well placed shocks and one truly memorable sequence. Curtis takes the Bob Hope approach (complete with quips) to his role as a fake mystic who is suddenly confronted with the real thing. Susan Strasberg makes a suitably vulnerable heroine and Syrian born Michael Ansara is quite believable as an Indian medicine man (no Native Americans in 1978) brought in to fight the evil. Stella Stevens, Ann Sothern, and Burgess Meredith add fun to the proceedings and director William Girdler (ABBY, GRIZZLY) doesn't give you time to think long enough on how preposterous it all is. Sadly this film was to have been his ticket to the big time and would have been (it was a box office hit) had he not been killed in a helicopter crash while scouting locations for his next film.

Avco Embassy for whom the film was made was sold to Norman Lear in 1982 and this and other Avco Embassy films disappeared into ownership limbo. Thanks to Anchor Bay THE MANITOU and other 70s A/E films like MURDER BY DECREE and WINTER KILLS have made it to DVD in beautiful widescreen transfers. THE MANITOU may be trash but it's really great trash and I'd rather be watching it than any number of present day horror films. Its well crafted approach to its material (no matter how ridiculous) rather than explicit effects from suffering victims makes it a guilty pleasure that I'll be happy to return to.",1175472000,22,2119,4.755434782608695
2711656,3,B000LP6L2A,"Every Friday night growing up at 11:00 o'clock the C.B.S. late night movies would come on. In a time before DVD's, cable(at least where I lived), and VCR's you watched what came on or you watch nothing at all. Friday's were almost always horror movies, first an episode of ""The Night Stalker(the best and greatest of all time) and then one or two movies. This is how i first saw ""The Manitou"" at 11 years old. It was creepy,strange, and mind blowing back then. So the other night my wife and I put the kids to bed curled up together and popped this ""gem"" in. Time has taken most of the bite out of this one and the silly parts are even worse now, but the charm of this stinker is still there if you look for it.

  It seems that an evil medicine man from 300 years ago has decided that Susan Strasberg is the perfect host to be reborn into,so in the guise of a very large boil, he tries to make a come back. Tony Curtis,her lover, isn't very happy about that(would you be) and the supernatural warfare is on.

  Like I said nothing great here except old memories and a fond look back to a much simpler time.",1175472000,,1107,4.19811320754717
2711657,4,B000LP6L2A,"While I must agree with many of the reveiewers of this film that say it is preposterous, silly, laughable, and the like, I must also add that watching the film is an entertaining experience. Yes, the story about a fetus growing on a woman's back and then becoming a four foot Indian ripping his way out of a tumor the size of basketball stretches the line of credibility. This pint-sized spirit has amazing powers as he can literally freeze an entire hospital ward, call forth the devil himself, and take the skin off of people's bodies through his mind. The most ridiculous aspects of the film, however, are the explanation and execution of how to fight the manitou. Apparently all things in life have their own manitou, so we see this incredibly powerful spirit temporarily beaten when Tony Curtis throws a typewriter at him. We are to believe the spirit of the machine harmed this powerful spirit. Yeah, okay. The special effects are very outdated and some of those will just make you burst out laughing. The scene where Tony Curtis(the former boyfriend of the girl with the shoulder-weilding fetus/pint-sized Indian spirit) and Michael Ansara(playing John Singing Rock or something like that who just happens to be an Indian medicine man ready, able, and willing to do battle with the most powerful Indian medicine man's spirit that ever lived...and this one apparently has ripped through the shoulders or bellies of five previous people) walk into the hospital room and see what I guess is suppose to be space will have you slapping your knee. But the very worst scene has to be the finale which I will not explain in great detail. Suffice it to say that Susan Strasberg(the poor woman aforementioned) is sitting up on a bed topless..., yes, you heard me, TOPLESS, throwing ele trical current from her fingers as she battles the manitou. It has to be seen to be believed. The acting in the film is not very good, but again very likable. Curtis plays a mystic and some of his scenes are good in the beginning. Ansara is ok, and Burgess Meredith gives the best performance in his five minute cameo. The little Indian who could was played much of the time by Felix Silla, the same fella that played Cousin It on The Addams Family and has appeared in countless horr/science fiction films.",1175299200,,2289,4.739348370927318

2711659,1,B000LP6L2A,"The Manitou is one of the worst films ever made, ""The Manitou"" has now been released on DVD, which proves that if it's 90 minutes and in color with sound that just about anything can become immortal. William Girdler was the heir to Ed Wood's legacy in the truly bad movies hall of fame. Tragically, he was killed in a helicopter accident just after finishing the Manitou. This DVD release may help reacquaint the current generation of filmgoers with just how ludicrous a film can be while maintaining a straight face. If these guys had not taken themselves so seriously they might have made the Indian Medicine Man version of ""Airplane"".

I mention all this because I was a guest on the set of The Manitou for a few days during production -- I knew one of the crew members and hung around while they filmed various scenes with Tony Curtis and Burgess Meredith. I also managed to get myself thrown off the set and off the lot, on the director's orders, for commenting within earshot of the screenwriter that ""...it all seems like Tonto meets the Exorcist to me."" Dejected, I went back into Hollywood and went to the second day performance of a new film showing at the Mann's Chinese, ""Star Wars"".

This is a truly awful film in that wonderful Ed Wood kind of way -- the quotes and sound bites are worth the price of the DVD just to hear actors actually say such things. And it was obviously this bad even standing there as they were filming...",1173571200,5,1442,4.5

I mean it had Tony Curtis and Susan Strasberg - but neither of them could save it. Curtis is given lines that are just so bad they're funny. And Susan Strasberg is totally wasted in this film.

2711676,1,B000LP6L2A,"Like any other massively-popular movie, ""The Exorcist"" seems to have inspired many derivative horror movies -- a person is possessed or infected by a horrifying presence, and someone has to rid them of it.

One of the more blatant examples would be ""The Manitou,"" a tepidly generic horror movie that attempts to cloak its ""Exorcist""-lite plot in Native American trappings, racial insensitivity and... a reference to Lovecraftian-horror writer August Derleth, of all people. The first half of this movie is enough to hypnotize you into a stupor, with lots of very serious discussions and a few unintentionally funny ""horrific"" scenes... but once the movie gives up on trying to be scary, it ends up becoming comedy gold.

A young woman named Karen (Susan Strasberg) develops a bizarre growth on the back of her neck -- it's about the size of a softball, and popped into existence over the course of a few days. Doctors are baffled by it, especially when they realize that it kind of resembles... a fetus! What's more, this strange tumor-baby-thing manifests strange mystical abilities, such as causing the surgeons to physically harm themselves, turning a surgical laser into a phaser, and possessing Karen's body .

Karen's boyfriend Harry (Tony Curtis) is a faux psychic who caters to elderly ladies, so he's understandably freaked that a genuine supernatural event is threatening Karen. After doing some research, he discovers that her neck-tumor is somehow related to a long-dead Native American shaman.

So he goes to get another shaman, John Singing Rock (Michael Ansara) of the Lebanese-American tribe, who is not particularly enthused about helping him -- especially when he finds that the shaman is the legendarily evil Misquamacus, and he cannot hope to actually match Misquamacus in magical power. And worse of all, Misquamacus is going to summon the Great Old One. No, not Cthulhu -- he's basically summoning Satan.

""The Manitou"" is one of those movies that is at its best when it isn't trying to actually be scary. The first half is capable of inducing narcolepsy -- many lingering shots of the beautiful San Francisco area, interspersed with people having serious discussions about medical problems and Native American lore. Director William Girdler seems to be incredibly uncomfortable with actually diving into possession-related, and seems to hope that the tepid body-horror will freak people out instead.

Unfortunately, the few genuine scares are... not particularly scary, especially since they always take place in well-lit, crowded areas. Some are simply silly (the medical laser blasting people), and others border on epic narm (an elderly lady is possessed, floats around and flings herself down a balsawood staircase).

But something happens about halfway through the story. After the revival of Misquamacus, the movie suddenly begins veering towards less realistic, more bizarre forms of storytelling, complete with some unintentionally funny dialogue (""Gichi Manitou? Harry, you don't call Gichi Manitou."" ""Oh, yeah, well he's going to get a person-to-person call from me... collect!""). Soon the hospital is not only deserted, but encrusted in a thick layer of ice with vast icicles, with a starfield occupying Karen's hospital room and a giant glittering computer dominating the story. It's as though Girdler has stopped caring about being scary, and has abandoned even the slightest illusions of subtlety.

SPOILERS AHOY.

It also has the single most delightful climactic battle ever committed to film. Not because it's good, but because it has a topless woman possessed by computer spirits shooting love-powered Force-lightning at the Eye of Sauron and a naked Native American dwarf, while asteroids pelt Harry and John. It is both insane and ridiculous, and I love every deranged second of it.

As for the acting, it ranges from tepidly average to utterly disinterested -- Tony Curtis in particular looks like he is counting the seconds before he can get paid, much like his character when dealing with elderly ladies who want their ""mystic mantra."" And Michael Ansara does an okay job playing the type of Native American character you would expect from 1978 -- John apparently doesn't have any aspect of his personality or life that isn't explicitly tied to his Native American roots (because that is totally how people are), and he's incapable of reconciling science and spirituality -- but he's at least more likable than Harry.

It's a third-rate ""Exorcist"" ripoff, but ""The Manitou"" redeems itself somewhat by becoming so bad it's hilarious -- so while most of the story is tedious, it gradually becomes magnificently bizarre and laugh-out-loud silly.",1459382400,3,4687,5.261044176706827

But hey...I'm a dreamer. For what we have here, which basically boils down to a high quality print of the film, is pretty damn good. It's a great occult thriller from the late 70's, something that you won't see much of anymore.
Let's get it straight--this is not the kind of film that most people are going to take seriously. In today's warped culture, we have an idea that entertainment must somehow match the personalities of a picture's stars, and serve to exploit them rather than the film's story. Not so back in the 70's, the absolute best decade ever for the movies (and, yes, there were many films that exploited the stars back then, but they had story and ideas to back up their flaunting). Now while there may be a few silly moments (even for this kind of story!), this is a mostly enjoyable presentation, with an interesting mystical tale that is absolutely outlandish, darkly funny, and creepy all in equal measure (although I thought it was far more humorous in places rather than scary). The ending is pretty outlandish, but it's hard to deny the fun that is at work in this movie. A-",1392681600,5,1529,4.604395604395604

I can say that while Manitou isn't quite as bad as remembered it's still pretty awful, though good for some laughs.  Story starts off promisingly enough if someone like David Cronenberg had directed it--a woman checks into a hospital with a rapidly growing tumor on her neck and x-rays suggest that it's actually a fetus.  Tony Curtis turns up as a friend of the afflicted woman and phony psychic and he doesn't do the movie any favors--by this point Curtis had ceased to be an actor and was instead a perpetually campy presence, very much like William Shatner became over the past couple of decades.  Manitou actually has a couple of creepy scenes and a pleasant cameo by a scenery chewing Burgess Meredith but the movie becomes hilariously awful once the 400 year old medicine man emerges from the woman's neck, leaving Tony Curtis and a modern medicine man he dug up to fight off the vengeful and powerful reborn Indian.

2711705,5,B000LP6L2A,"I came here initially because I assumed about 3 people had reviewed this film. What a shock! Anyway, this film is an Exorcist ripoff, about 5 years too late. I'd heard of it and it's presumed awfulness for years, but only saw it today. This very day!

Where to begin? First of course, Tony Curtis. What combination of substance abuse and IRS penalties led him to take this part is anybody's guess. He looks a couple of decades older than he had with Roger Moore in The Persuaders a few years before, and his receding hair had to be partially colored in, but damn -- Tony Curtis in a 1970's horror film? I'm there! It's all the more sad when you consider his daughter Jamie Lee was doing ""Halloween"" at this same time. Sheesh!

The first half of this plays like an ""ABC Movie of the Week."" Phony psychic Harry Erskine, ripping off old ladies for tarot card readings (heck, they probably knew but didn't care) is contacted by an old flame about to go under the knife to remove a tumor (400 yr old medicine man) from her neck.

Things go incredibly bad. I can not stress this enough. And being a stalwart sort of fake psychic conman, Tony, goes on a quest to find help for her. Here we have some nice scenes between Tony & Stella Stevens, an old friend & fake gypsy with real psychic powers, and Burgess Meredith as an expert on Native American occultism. These scenes lifted the movie for a while. It kind of settled into low key occult investigation like say, ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud"". My hopes went way up. Then comes Michael Ansara.

Ansara, a non-Indian actor who played Cochise on about 74 episodes of Bonanza (this may not be accurate) plays John Singing Rock, who initially deflects Tony with a ""bury my heart at Wounded Knee"" speech, then says, ""Awww screw it. Let's kick some Manitou butt, White Man."" Here's where the movie take an irrevocable turn into near legendary awfulness.

Ansara did however look quite impressive in his shaman gear. Maybe too impressive. Like Ricardo Montalban in ""The Wrath of Khan"". He was a talented actor, and hey, any guy who's banged Barbara Eden is alright by me. But he bulged out of the movie like that thing on Susan Strasberg's neck!!! He didn't exactly disappear into the part like say, the incomparable Daniel Day Lewis. And by 1978 wasn't it a bit crass not to use a real Native American? For G-d's sake, was Jay Silverheels busy?

Then things just go friggin nuts. It turns out everything has it's own Manitou. The toaster, Michael Ansara's wig, Leslie Uggams, your mama. EVERYTHING. It was just too much. Then the movie ends with a bunch of Xanadu light effects. Oh, then Susan Strasberg shows us a little something. Two pickets to Titsburg please! Ummm, I'm very sorry.

Anyway, you get the picture. That said, I give it five stars! It's just fun. Miscast as he was, Michael Ansara was actor enough to make his shaman interesting. Looked like he was having a good time too. I can deal with it.

Acting coach Susan Strasberg really gave her all, and was quite nice to look at when something wasn't bursting out of her neck. Like Mia Farrow, but pretty. The supporting cast was excellent. And Tony Curtis? Ten years after this he was sporting a foamy crest of white hair and selling his paintings for big money! He was not at his best here, but still, great to watch.",1367366400,9,3326,4.540901502504173

2711708,2,B000LP6L2A,"<strong>The Manitou</strong> (William Girdler, 1978)

William Girdler, who got his start with the cult classic <em>Asylum of Satan</em> in 1972, would complete just nine films before his untimely death in a helicopter accident whioe scouting locations in the Phillippines for his follow-up to <em>The Manitou</em>. Some might consider that a blessing for filmgoers everywhere. Girdler's movies embraced the concept of over-the-top in a way few filmmakers did, even in the seventies. His work had more in common with the blaxploitation film directors of the time than it did mainstream Hollywood. (It is no coincidence that Girdler, a white guy, was tabbed to make a couple of blaxploitation films early in his career--<em>Abby</em>, an <em>Exorcist</em> rip-off at least one critic has called the greatest blaxploitation film of all time, and <em>Sheba, Baby!</em>, a quickly-shot Pam Grier vehicle.) In a way, his films, most of them rip-offs of popular genre movies of the time, would presage the popularity (and stupidity) of studios like The Asylum, but Girdler's flicks had a style to them the hacks who work for The Asylum can't touch with a ten-foot pole. Which is not to say Girdler's movies are good, per se, but they're at least enjoyable.

Take <em>The Manitou</em>. This is a movie that could never get made today. It's an absolute exploitation cheesefest, though to Girdler's credit it's actually not a ripoff of a contemporary genre favorite. Instead, he loosely adapted a Graham Masteron novel and then somehow, despite the complete ludicrousness of the resulting script, managed to rope in some of Hollywood's biggest stars to appear in this turkey. Tony Curtis? Burgess Meredith? Ann Sothern? Stella Stevens? <em>The Manitou</em> is in many ways exactly what would have happened had Catherine Hardwicke somehow managed to cast Tom Cruise, Jason Statham, Halle Berry, and Gwyneth Paltrow for the lead roles in <em>Twilight</em>. Except that <em>The Manitou</em> is slightly less cheesy.

Plot: Tony Curtis, who must have really needed the money, plays Harry Erskine, a psychic who's misusing his gifts, as we open, to prey on wealthy upper-west-side widows. He gets a call from his ex-girlfriend, Karen (Susan Strasberg, just off the success of <em>Rollercoaster</em>), who complains of an odd ailment that, to make a long story short, turns out to be caused by the soul of a four-hundred-year-old Native American shaman who's decided Karen is a perfect vessel in which he can be reborn. Harry, who has no experience with Native American medicine men, goes in search of an expert, and comes up with John Singing Rock (<em>The Message</em>'s Michael Ansara, who it should be noted is a Syrian actor), a shaman who's at least willing to help. But even John Singing Rock has no idea what the two of them are up against...

Let's put aside the lunacy of a Syrian actor portraying a Native American in the broadest, most stereotypical way possible and picking up a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the Saturn Awards for it (the Saturns are the Oscar equivalents for the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films). Let's put aside, in fact, that every major actor who worked on this turkey turned in the worst performance of his or her career (Strasberg, at least, spends most of the film in a coma). In the case of Burgess Meredith, especially, that's really saying something. Let's put aside the puzzling camerawork, the overly-dramatic score, the odd lighting choices. All of those are worth noting in passing, but I'll tell you what: even if the first ninety minutes of this movie had been perfect, spectacular, Oscar-worthy, the last fifteen would still leave you lying on the floor breathless with hysterical laughter. Obviously, I can't link to them here, but for those of you with decent search skills, the climax of the film can be found on youtube. Watch it and tell me I'm wrong. It's absolutely flat-out horrendous. It makes you wonder why this pile of muck simply wasn't shelved until the advent of the direct-to-DVD low-budget horror film (this movie would be quite at home in a rack of those). And then I will once again remind you that <em>this movie was nominated for a Saturn for Best Supporting Actor</em> (as well as one for Best Make-Up; thankfully, it lost both--the BSA went to Burgess Meredith in <em>Magic</em>, Best Make-Up to <em>The Fury</em> [elsewhere this ish]).

An absolutely horrific film, but so completely cheesy that it does have some cult-classic status. You could come up with dozens of drinking games for this one. * ",1325116800,,4582,5.078353253652058
2711709,3,B000LP6L2A,"The Manitou(1978) is a camp classic based on the novel by Graham Masterton. This film was made to cash in on the success of The Exorcist(1973). This was director William Girlder's last film before he died. The late Susan Strasberg played Karen Tandy, a woman with a ""tumor"" growing on her back. The tumor is actually the fetus of an old, evil Native American shaman. Doctors are maimed and killed when they take X-rays or get too close to the tumor. A manitou is a ""spirit"" or ""lifeforce"" in every rock, tree, organism, and piece of technology according to Native American mythology. Karen's boyfriend Harry(Tony Curtis) hires a Native American medicine man(Michael Ansara) to help fight the evil, supernatural menace growing in Karen's tumor.
The Manitou is tense and it takes itself seriously until the last ten minutes where it forgets about the plot and turns into a wild, over-the-top, LSD-fueled, special effects driven, 2001-style spectacle! The film is blessed with sexy Stella Stevens for fifteen minutes. Burgess Meredith also makes a guest appearance. It's amazing that The Manitou got a PG rating from the MPAA. We can see Susan Strasberg's bare breasts, severed heads, exploding people, and some blood and guts! It shows flying fireballs and a hospital shaken by an earthquake! There's some campy humor with Tony Curtis listening to disco music. Michael Ansara(The Star Trek TV show, Guns of the Magnificent Seven) is quite good as medicine man John Singing Rock. Lalo Schifrin's music score for The Manitou is quite good. The Manitou(1978) is cheesy, 1970's fun.",1320796800,,1576,5.065384615384615

Of course, Curtis being a phoney he seeks help himself, first from Stella Stevens' gypsy and then, deciding to fight fire with fire, Michael Ansara's medicine man. Ansara gives a surprisingly good performance considering the material, but even his Indian magic isn't enough to fend off an evil Felix Silla from summoning the Devil himself, who can only be defeated by turning on every computer in the hospital at the same time and Susan Strasberg getting her bits out in a vaguely New Age Meets 2001 finale. Despite the synopsis, unintentional laughs are in short supply, although a sequence where one of Curtis' elderly customers is possessed, floats down the hallway and throws herself down the stairs is a mini-masterclass in ineptitude as it fluctuates between failed attempts at humor and laughable attempts at drama. Still, any film where the co-writer is blown up onscreen and where a frozen nurse is accidentally decapitated isn't entirely without some merit.

2711717,4,B000LP6L2A,"The Manitou is an unbelievable film experience, in that it astounds me that a film as cockamamy as this one even exists. To truly grasp the level of absurdity to The Manitou's film plot, try doing this experiment. Next time you are hanging out with your friends, have them think of the silliest ideas they can come up with for a horror film, then when they have submitted their ludicrous offerings, tell them the story of The Manitou. Once you have finished telling the story, have everyone vote on which story is the silliest, chances are, The Manitou is going to beat their ideas six ways from Sunday.

Sorry to spoil the plot, but a story as trifling as this one has to be told to be believed.

Basically, you have a woman in her 40's who develops a cist on the back of her neck. The cist grows very rapidly and starts to resemble a fetus. Within just three days of her discovery of the cist, it is already the size of a door knob and shifts positions four or five times a day. Around that time her boyfriend, ( played by a then 50 something year old Tony Curtis who needed the work ) gets a concerned phone call from her, and for around five minutes of film time, the viewer is puzzled by watching a rekindling romance with a middle aged couple walking hand and hand along Fisherman's Warf. But all is not lost, for that night as the two love birds sleep side by side, the cist-lady starts mumbling "" Panna Witchi Salatou."" in her sleep, which both concerns and puzzles Tony Curtis. The next day as Tony's babe is about to get her cist surgically removed, his elderly client Mrs. Herz stops by for her weekly tarot card reading. "" Did I forget to mention that Tony Curtis's character makes a living by being a fake fortune telling mystic?"" Well as he lays out her weekly cards and swills a load of BS, he pulls a card out of the deck for her personally to finalize her week. You can guess what card it is. Mrs. Herz passes out dramatically, pops back awake and starts yelling ""PANNA!!"" Then she breaks out into an Indian war dance in front of the recliner she was just passed out in. Tony Curtis is now calling the operator, but before he could finish frantically asking for help, Mrs. Herz posture snaps completely erect, and she quickly turns and hustles out of his apartment. At the doorway as he runs to help her, she screams "" PANNA!!"" at him, making him jump back. Outside his apartment, she floats in standing position down the hallway and tosses herself down the stair well. In surgery his babe wakes up and chants the magic words and the doctor takes the scalpel to his own hand rather then cutting the rapidly growing cist off of her neck. Its now a familiar drill, the cist is growing like a weed, while exuding mind control and dominance over anyone that can threaten its rebirth. At the same time the audience gets to see The Manitou's awesome scary powers.

The next act of the film is where we learn just what the cist really is. We also learn that the cist is going to kill the host that it grows on. Lastly we learn that the only way to prevent her death, is to stop the rebirth of the creature in her cist. This is a very common story process, especially in the outrageously far out horror films of that time period. Everything is going to be explained to us, as if the very act of explanation will in some way make us buy this wacky concept. And what is this wacky concept you ask? Well its none other then a 400 year old native American medicine mans spirit using her life essence to be reincarnated for another existence on Earth. Once he is born, she will be dead, that is unless Tony Curtis can persuade a present day South Dakota native American medicine man to come back to San Francisco with him, and draw a circle around her bed with sacred sands and do cosmic battle with the unwanted entity. Of course the sacred sand circle will make it so that she won't die after giving birth to this thing, just so long as the creature doesn't break the circle and get past it. In this way, we get to see MR. Manitou in the flesh.

""Manitou's got a big butt!""

As the second act progresses and The Manitou nears its due date, the cist on her back becomes absurdly gigantic. Just before its birth it grows to the size of a rucksack. By now our South Dakota medicine man, John Singing Rock, ( At least his name wasn't John Blowing Rock ) learns that The Manitou is none other then the most powerful and legendary medicine man to ever grace the native tribes. He was a person of such extreme power that he could make mountains grow and topple at will, and cause rivers to flow in reverse ( They always say that about powerful Indian lore characters ). As the cast of characters take a breather, and John Singing Rock naps in the next room, our Manitou starts to hatch out of its egg. First, right as Tony Curtis heads to the room to check on his woman, a freshly skinned intern is thrown by telekinetic power through the glass pane of her hospital door head first. Tony Curtis screams, ( it runs in the family ) and everybody gathers to watch The Manitou stretch the skin of her back out like pizza cheese, and emerge from her groaning writhing body where it slithers and flops onto the floor under her hospital bed. It then hoists itself up onto its feet and faces us spectators for the first time. You should see this sawed off little runt, you won't believe what you're looking at. He stands all of two and a half feet tall, has a giant block head with clouded over milky eyes, a cruel twisted mouth, and a huge butt jutting out from its tiny stubby little legs. Believe me, just seeing this creature is worth the low price of buying a DVD copy of the film.

The logic of cheese.

What fallows has to be one of the most ridiculously contrived moments in horror movie history. Much like in The Exorcist, ( which this film is copying in case you haven't figured that out already ) our cast of Manitou fighters are taking a breather in the waiting room, so of course they leave another intern to guard the horrors inside The Manitou room. So what does this intern do? Why, he does what any of us would do if we were left in a room where a patient was left unconscious and uncovered on a bed, with all the skin on her back pulled and ripped so that it looks like a popped and deflated hot air balloon. He does what any of us would do in the presence of a naked two and a half foot tall meditating chanting humanoid creature, thats coated in birth fluids and blood, while looking like some sadistic demonic dwarf. And he does what any of us would do in the presence of another intern just like us, lying on the floor in a pool of their own mess, minus their skin. He nods off of course.

Saddle bags, stretch marks, and an inappropriate question I would of asked the director.

I won't bore you with describing the cosmic battle that takes place itself. Suffice to say, that this is a popcorn variety croud pleaser, so all the good people that matter live, John Singing Rock gets his tobacco, and The Manitou is expelled back into the spirit realm from whence it came. What puzzles me however, is the future life of Tony Curtis's character and his girl friend. Would their love life be adversely effected by the fact that she gave birth to a monster out of her back? Also, I can't help but think that no amount of plastic surgery in the world could ever repair her back and make it look normal again. So would Tony Curtis have to resort to missionary possition during sex in order not to see it, or would he develope an unsavory fetish for unnatural looking stretch marks and scars? I told you that I had an inappropriate question, but darn it! I gots'ta know?

When a fetus grows on the back of his girlfriend's neck, it is up to Harry Erskine, a psychic scheisster, to find help for her. Seems he began to meddle in certain occult practices that he could not handle, and so his problems surmount, amusingly displayed when an elderly client is possessed and floats out the door and tumbles down the stairs. Despite all attempts to help her condition using ""white man's medicine"", he realizes he must consult alternative methods including a seance where an ""evil spirit"" manifests as a black head rising from the table.

While researching, he finds the name of professor Dr. Snow {Burgess Meredith} who recommends he fight fire with fire, leading him to a reservation where he meets reticent Medicine Man John Singing Rock, who takes on the challenge for a generous donation to the Native American education fund and some tobacco. When he discovers the fetus is the reincarnation of a legendary powerful shaman named Misquamacus {played by Felix ""Cousin Itt"" Silla and Joe Gieb}, his reticence grows but nonetheless decides to attempt a fight, despite a warning by Misquamacus to not help the palefaces. Every effort is met with defeat as Misquamacus summons everything from a lizard demon, the zombified body of a dead orderly, to the elements themselves, transforming the floor level into a veritable cave. Unfortunately, Misquamacus is deformed and diminuative due to profuse X-radiation while attempting to decipher the mysterious growth.

When John Singing Rock explains that all things have a manitou, even seemingly inanimate objects, and when all else fails, Harry conceives of an idea to use the manitous of all the hospital's computers, hoping to amass their combined energy to combat Misquamacus, who at that point has summoned forth ""The Devourer"", a supposed equivalent to The Devil, which leads to a surprisingly impressive phantasmagoric ending.

With subtle shades of Koyaanisqatsi, the plot seems to convey a message of the progression of technology at odds with the natural world, although in the end, a cooperative balance can be found.

2711726,5,B000LP6L2A,"Hilarious!  This movie throws in all kitchen sinks... then adds the bathroom sink... then returns to the kitchen to throw in more kitchen sinks!!

Here's kind of what happens:

Some lady has a tumor growing on her neck... naturally it turns out to be the fetus of a reincarnated evil indian medicine man.

An old lady becomes possessed and floats down the hallway... and then is thrown out the window by unseen Manitou.  A seance occurs,  a head rises up out of a table... then sinks back into the table.

Finally good medicine man and Tony Curtis (!) battle evil Manitou in the hospital room after it's born/ripped out of the woman's back.

Supernatural battles occur... Manitou is winning.  Tony Curtis and Medicine Man are about to give up... that's when an earthquake hits the hospital.  Naturally evil Manitou has summoned ""The Great Old One"" - aka Satan.  I guess since evil Manitou was already winning he needed help from The Great Old One??

Tony Curtis and Medicine Man return for another round against evil Manitou...

It goes without saying that everyone and everything has it's own Manitou -- including typewriters.  Medicine Man summons the Manitous of all the machines (!) in the building and focuses their energy against evil Manitou.

""Machine Manitous -- hear me, send evil Manitou back to the time of times!""

By the way... at this point Evil Manitou has turned the hospital room into OUTER SPACE!!  But you probably guessed that since it only follows.

Medicine Man isn't having that much success focusing the machine manitous.  So naturally what happens is the dead woman comes to life, is topless and zaps evil Manitou out of existence.

That's when Satan gets into a laser battle with dead topless women.  Also, Satan throws meteors at her.  Finally dead topless woman zaps Satan into nothingness.

Pure genious!  I'd say go out and immediately rent it... but instead this movie must be bought so it can be carefully studied over and over again!",1184716800,,1967,4.820359281437126
2711727,5,B000LP6L2A,"I remember watching this film many, many years ago. I've always enjoyed it. I had read the book first, by Graham Masterton. ""The Manitou"" was based off of a factual story about a boy in Japan who had a growth on his arm the size of a basketball (seriously). But Masterton never said what had actually been in the growth.

The movie doesn't stray TOO far from the book. It was entertaining. Ansara was terrific as Singing Rock. And Jamie Lee Curtis' dad as Harry Erskine was great.

I loved the concept of an ages old Medicine Man - Misquamacas - being reborn through Karen. This was an all-around fun movie. No unnecessary gore, no stupid teens running around half-naked, screaming their heads off, and no back-wood hicks wanting to slaughter people for rituals.

If you want something WORTH the viewing, you have to see ""The Manitou"". You also should really read the books - The Manitou, The Return of the Manitou, and The Burial. They are out of print, but you can find them in used bookstores, and possibly on Amazon.",1183420800,2,1020,4.593406593406593
2711728,4,B000LP6L2A,"Karen Tandy (Susan Strasberg) discovers that what she thought was a tumor on her back, is actually the growing fetus of a 400yo medicine man, and an evil one at that! She is hospitalized and her friend, Harry Erskine (Tony Curtis), who happens to be a ""psychic"", attempts to help Karen by going to a medium (Stella Stevens) for guidance. After a catastrophic sance, Harry decides to see an anthropologist (Burgess Meredith from Burnt Offerings and The Sentinel), who tells Harry and company that they need another medicine man. Enter Michael Ansara (Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea) as John Singing-Rock, medicine man. Much hocus pocus and hoodoo later, and poor Karen finally unloads the little bugger that's been making her look like Quasimodo. Zish! Bang! Boom! The hospital is transformed into a spiritual battleground, and John Singing-Rock goes to war against the forces of darkness. Yes, THE MANITOU is silly, but it's still a lot of fun to watch! The climax is non-stop hilarity, worth the cost of the movie! William Girdler (Grizzly, Day Of The Animals) makes it all entertaining somehow...",1181606400,3,1099,4.978260869565218
2711729,4,B000LP6L2A,"The Manitou is another example of how the movie industry in the 70s would get behind just about any outrageous concept and let it rip, sometimes getting established stars to be in the film.  This movie is kinda like a Native American variation on the Exorcist.  Not that it's a carbon copy of that film, but there are similarities.  Using Native American mythology and folklore for horror films is something I wish we saw more of, and I'm not talking about the old plot device of haunted houses being built on Native American burial grounds.  It's directed by William Girdler, who directed the Oscar(TM) winning, blockbuster smashes, Grizzly and Day of the Animals.  Susan Strasberg finds a lump on the back of her neck, and naturally the concern is cancer.  But cancer would be letting her off easy...This is a MANITOU!!  That's right, a never-dying lifeforce of a 400 year old medicine man who's out to put the kibosh on humanity.  He just needs to use Susan's neck as a kind of incubator before he's ripe enough to bust out.  So he uses Susan to cause some supernatural mischief and occasionally communicate through her.  When he does bust out(around an hour into the film), he looks a bit underdone coz he's less than four feet high.  Then the MANITOU must do battle with none other than Tony Curtis himself along with a Native American medicine man(at least I think he's a medicine man) that Curtis has brought along for the ""exorcism"".  The battle is played out on an abandoned hospital wing with the climax looking like something from Buck Rogers.  If this sounds silly, it is.  If it sounds fun and entertaining, it is.  Movies like this are definitely a good time.  What's really a good time though is watching Tony Curtis turning on his stereo and getting down to a funky disco tune.  How often do you see that?  And how often to you see a midget in heavy makeup to make him look Native American?  Not often, I'd say.  But if you want to see all this and more, you should check out...THE MANITOU!!!!!",1179014400,2,2010,4.592696629213483

See while at the drive in apparenly my mom was so moved by the horror that she started having contractions.  Whose to say that perhaps my sister is a demon after all!
