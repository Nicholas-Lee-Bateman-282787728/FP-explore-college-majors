7992232,5,B00009P1NM,"This is a terrific show for guitar and improvisation geeks.  Henry Kaiser obviously LOVES his guitars, and shows each one off like a proud parent.  More importantly, he recognizes each instrument's unique voice, and plays them to show their unique talents. Some guitars, like the ZVex and Klein instruments, have special abilities.  Others, like the Moonstone and Anderson guitars, just have really good voices.  And you won't be seeing some rock-star collection of 1957 Les Pauls and prewar Martins. He collects guitars beause they are INTERESTING, not because they're collectable.
You probably wouldn't be buying this unless you are already a fan of Henry Kaiser's playing, and he doesn't disappoint.  He's an inherently good solo guitar player, and his playing here ranges from very good to completely mind-boggling. And if you're a guitarist who wants to cop licks and technique, there's much to learn from watching his hands.
Despite the guitar-geek focus, this video has found devoted fans in my nine-year-old children, who love the crazy sounds and relaxed, conversational approach.  His intimate storytelling of ""Meet the Flintstones"" is their current favorite song.  Then again, one of the best aspects of his playing is the balance between avant-garde and accessible.
Something else i really appreciated was the excellent film footage from his trip to Antartica.  When i first read about that trip on his website (before he made it), it seemed like some crazy fantasy.  Henry Kaiser is the ONLY musician i can think of who could do justice to Antartica!  Slide guitar on the south pole (not at, ON), scuba diving beneath the ice, images of the skeletons of penguins and helicopters... who else could capture both majesty and absurdity in the same note?
I do have a couple of nits to pick... first, he makes extensive use of effects (especially looping) in his playing without showing his effects rig or how he uses it.  I know the video is about guitars, but i'd like to see more on effects as well.  Second, the relaxed, informal quality occasionally leans toward amateurishness.  On the other hand, i'll take amateurishness over pretentiousness any day!
And therein lies the greatest beauty of this whole DVD... its purely unpretentious performance.  You can't help but feel that this is who Henry Kaiser is, what he loves, and what he creates, even when he crosses the line into geekiness. :}",1058832000,8,2405,5.055696202531646

7992236,5,B00009P1NM,"Kaiser is one of the most gifted, and perhaps the most innovative, guitarist to emerge from the U.S. in the past 30 years. This video allows guitarists and enthusiasts to study aspects of his wide-ranging technique, and perhaps to cop a few licks.
Kaiser presents his material with a sort of Bay-Area-Andy-Griffith tone that makes the entire experience relaxed, even when his playing is frenetic. Highly recommended.",1057276800,,416,5.223880597014926
7992237,4,B00009P1NM,"In an alternative universe henry Kaiser would be on the cover of Guitar Player every month as a master of a different musical style with a nifty guitar in his hand to match. The next best thing to that scenario is to have a look at this DVD, where he shows off two dozen of the quirkiest pieces of his extensive guitar collection, provides informative and friendly introductions to each instrument, and more importantly gives each one a workout with a solo guitar piece. Sometimes this means the blues, sometimes a John Fahey-style acoustic number, sometimes a Captain Beefheart-inspired ditty, sometimes a crazed, effects- laden screaming lead that makes Hendrix's antics seem almost antiquated. Plus some incredible footage of Kaiser playing slide guitar at the South Pole--literally! If you've enjoyed Kaiser's globe-spanning projects with David Lindley or his various homages to Miles Davis and the Grateful Dead, or you're just a guitar lover, this DVD is well worth a look.",1057190400,4,979,5.125
