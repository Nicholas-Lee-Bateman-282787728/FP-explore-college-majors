The DVD was the worst quality DVD I've ever seen.  Every track was defective in both the picture and the sound!  It was completely unusable, so I returned it.  If you're considering this, beware!  Hopefully the company will take heed and do something to produce a good DVD for their promising product.",1358121600,3,449,4.349397590361446

8456679,5,B0054GZW0I,"I loved this workout! The DVD I got came a little sratched, but hopefully I should be getting a replacement for it soon. This was a good time.. I loved learning the dances and they aren't too hard for beginners (I'm at intermediate level of dance) or others.. it's a good workout!",1330905600,4,280,4.403846153846154
