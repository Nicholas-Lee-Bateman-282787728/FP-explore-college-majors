He likes to dance around to the music in the begining. The children in the dvd are not able to go to the zoo so instead the little angels takes them to meet Adam, Noah, and Jonah. I love that it introduces these biblical stories in a way for young children to understand and be entertained by them. It also contains a lot of witty dialogue and slapstick jokes. I also love that it reinforces important concepts for children such as taking care of their room, and working together to complete a task. This dvd addresses how to conquer fears as well. I would have bought this for my sister as well if she didn't already get one too...its a winner!",1327104000,2,780,4.312925170068027
8498911,5,B006IVNIRW,"As a parent trying to instill biblical teachings into my children, this is a great tool. Each of the DVD's teach practical skills but with a biblical approach. My daughter often references biblical stories that she hears from these DVD's. Coupled with what my wife and I are teaching her from the Bible, this really helps. I'm a proud dad who highly recommends the ""Little Angels"" series.",1483660800,,388,4.8059701492537314

8498917,2,B006IVNIRW,"I ordered this and send it all the way to Singapore only to find out it doesnt work on any of my devices at all.
Tried every DVD player and it doesnt work. Got my little boy very upset. He loved the book but was really looking forward to the DVD.",1373932800,,246,3.843137254901961
8498918,5,B006IVNIRW,"These DVD's are what I have been looking for for a long time. I love the little angel charachters and the way they are so kid friendly. My students related to them right away and I love the fact that each DVD is presented so that you can stop for discussions between sections. The children picked up the Biblical references right away and were really excited when they made the connection between what they knew and what they were seeing. We are just waiting for the ""1,2,3's"" realease.",1328054400,2,486,4.534090909090909
8498919,5,B006IVNIRW,"I have been BEGGING for a DVD series like this! As a mama to two little boys, you can imagine how crazy it gets around our house & sometimes I just want FIVE minutes of silence. Well this DVD series has given me much more than that! All the crying in our house has been replaced with laughter (and sometimes I laugh along too!) I think this is just about the cutest cartoon I've seen in years! (Wish it would've been around when my oldest was growing up!) Its funny but its smart, too! I've noticed Ryan and Matt now taking an interest in learning about God and animals...and it even got them to clean their room! Roma Downey has struck gold. We're taking this series as a gift to every birthday party we attend this year. Kid tested...MOTHER APPROVED! :)",1328054400,13,755,4.361702127659575
8498920,5,B006IVNIRW,"I got this DVD for my neices and nephes and they LOVED it!  The characters are super cute and the creative story line keep kids entertained.  I would defintely recommend the LITTLE ANGELS series to anyone with children (or like me, low attention span neices and nephews).  Can't wait for the next one!  Hopefully they'll come out with a show on television soon.",1328054400,4,361,4.682539682539683
