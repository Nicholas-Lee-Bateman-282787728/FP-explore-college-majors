2045142,5,B0001Z3I12,I remember watching this show on tv as a young girl. I think that's what helped me joined the army when I turned 18. The actors in it are almost like being your family. i have already worn one set out with my daughter watching it. She even likes it. I highly recommand it for your collection.,1084579200,,292,4.140350877192983
2045143,5,B0001Z3I12,"I am so glad that Tour Of Duty is now available on DVD as it was one of my all time favorite shows. I watched every episode with my little son Jason who probably enjoyed the show more than I did and that is why I am ordering it for him as he is presently serving in the United States Marine Corps. He will no doubt treasure this great DVD and relive those fantastic times we had together on the couch shouting at Sarg and LT to look out. I would highly recomend this super series to all of you fathers out there to share with your sons and maybe they will become great men like my son, Lcpl. Weber, Jason USMC. This one's for you sir.",1084233600,,634,4.0
2045144,5,B0001Z3I12,Finally Tour of Duty on DVD.  After TNT stopped airing the show in syndicate a year or so ago I was angry that I had not recorded as many shows as I could have. I remember watching the show when I was 11 with my father and younger brother back in the 80's. I know I've seen every episode a couple of times and they will NEVER get old.  From pictures/audio/screen savers/ and a great T-shirt I am now on top of the world knowing that on June 8th I can spend the night in with THE boys.,1083628800,,484,3.9285714285714284
2045145,5,B0001Z3I12,The first time I watched this show I was six years old. I loved the show then and I still love it now. My parents taped many episodes for me the first time they aired but the tapes are so old and worn out. I'm thrilled that finally after all these years it's coming out on DVD. It's a great show that covers all the important factors of the Vietnam war and it does with a warmth and grace that is lacking from other Vietnam War dramas.,1083456000,2,435,4.011494252873563
2045146,4,B0001Z3I12,"TOUR OF DUTY did for the Vietnam veteran what COMBAT did for those who served on the front lines of WWII 20 years earlier.  Released in 1987 on the heels of big screen counterparts, FULL METAL JACKET and PLATOON, TOUR struggled in the ratings, but CBS had the courage to stick with the series and spun 2 additional seasons.  The atmosphere is authentic:  The Rolling Stones ""Paint It Black"" opened every episode, and there was a genuine mix of combatants played by some great young talent, many of whom were in their first roles.  The scripts were at times heart breaking (the rescue of a Vietnamese infant), regular cast members were killed, and the pain was a stinging as a napalm strike.  TOUR was a fine tribute to a much maligned war.",1082419200,19,739,4.568181818181818

I have waited for years to purchase all seasons and then find out that there is no original sound track.  I have read numerous complaints the soundtrack is absent and for that reason potential purchasers are refraining from buying the series.  There is no such thing as a fast Buck when marketing a classic.  I also will refrain from purchase as will many others will continue to do.

I laugh at the credits when I see they really picked the colorful words to describe the friedly women in the episode credits.  wh_re #1 wh__re #2 and so on.

2045265,5,B0001Z3I12,"If you are a big fan of ""Tour of Duty"" (as I am) I strongly suggest that you ignore the posts that say it's not worth buying because they got rid of the theme music. When I first saw that Tour of Duty was offered on Amazon I was thrilled, but after reading the reviews that said the lack of the original music (think ""Paint it Black"", plus others) really ruined the experience I decided not to get it.  That was a couple, three years ago.

My wife bought me the first two seasons for my birthday this November (2012), and while you do feel a twinge of regret when you start watching the first episode and don't hear the original theme song, you get into the show, and you quickly realize that the reason you liked the show was because the show was great, not because it had ""Paint it Black"" as the theme song. Now, don't get me wrong - ""Paint it Black"" was a great song, but I think because Tour of Duty fans associate it with the show, they come to think that it's a huge part of the reason they loved the show. No, they loved the show because it was well written and they had a very likeable core of characters played by great actors.

The new theme music isn't some well-known tune (at least, I don't recognize it as such), it sounds like it was written specifically for the show. I don't know how to describe it, but after about three episodes it seems so right for the show that I am now wondering if maybe this music was in the original series, but just not the major theme music.

Made them realize there is another place that's a hell of a lot better than where they were. Girl friends, cars, cruising, Fri. night football games...All were connected to the music...It's the one thing the producers could of included that was possible. The other would have been the smells.....which isn't yet possible. Would add a whole new dimension to vicarious experiences....LOL!  Yeah, I miss the music. I have even considered taking the DVD's to a local sound studio to have my own copies re-recorded and insert the music. I think it is possible nowadays. But even with the music missing I think it gives a good representation of the American soldier and his general conduct in a political no-win situation.

I bought it sight unseen and I am very impressed.  Because I didn't see it as 1st run I have no problems with the music changes.  I think that the overuse of period music sometimes mare some VN movies, ie ""Air America.""

I had some problems with the first couple of episodes but after that I was very impressed with the writing and dialog.

I've read a lot about the Vietnam War and they did a good job of covering the diverse elements of the war.  What I like most was that the images of soldiers looked like the TV news scenes that I saw during the war, while movies like ""Platoon"" and ""Apocolpse Now"" appear as a funhouse mirror version of the war.

I know that shows like ""Combat"" and ""Hogan's Heroes"" were shown in Germany, I wonder if the ""liberators"" of South Vietnam allow this series to be shown?",1296604800,,1052,4.304568527918781

Am I so glad that I did! This show rates among my top three favorite shows ever. I don't usually review products but I saw so many negatives about A. the music, and B. the acting. Now I never seen this show when it originally aired (as I was quite young at the time), so I don't know what the music was like before. What I can say is that I think the show is perfectly fine the way it is on the DVD's with the music it has now. As for the acting, I saw someone review saying that Terence Knox's acting was terrible. To each his own opinion but I say Terence Knox's acting was TERRIFIC not terrible! His portrayal of the character, ""Sarge"" Zeke Anderson, is what brought me in hook, line, and sinker on the first episode! I would like the show without Terence Knox but I LOVE the show with him. Sarge is so wise and understanding, he makes the show. Another thing I love about Tour of Duty is the historical facts it shows about the Vietnam war at the beginning of every episode. I love the friendship between the characters, the 'buddy bonding', the look at the war from their perspective, and the fact that we see blood and people die but without the excess gore that some war movies have.

Since a long Time I have been looking for this wonderful Serie. I am living in the Netherlands and here it is not for sale, alltought it has been broadcasted on the Dutch television during the '90.

So I looked at Amazon.com and found it!!!!

The First Season gives a good view of an standard Army Infantry Unit during the Tour in Vietnam. What the soldiers daily experience and had to face. It is Historical correctly made. Only in the Pilot the soldiers are not wearing propper uniforms and for example helmets (the ones you see are the last models from the 1980s). But during the rest of the episodes a very correct display of uniforms and Gear are shown.

The acting is great and during the episodes you get a Band with the Group.
I recommend this serie to every person who is interested in Modern History and/or the Vietnam War.

The acting, on the other hand is not the best.  T.Knox especially is atrocious.  Have you seen the one where they save the baby?  I mean what kind of acting school did he go to anyway?  Did they just pick him up from the street?  I guess he came cheap, like all tv actors usually do.

And they still have to take the same hill, over and over again (though to be fair, this was also the complaint of the Nissei in WWII, and others).

It's a great series, though there's something odd about Knox (his inner pixie seems to want to escape, or something). There is a plot about the drug trade in Vietnam, about corrupt Vietnamese officers, foolish American command, the letdown of knowing what it really cost to win this medal or that, the strain of returning home and re-enlistment, and of course the loved one going off 'with Jody', which is literally part of the old WWII drill cadence.

I understand that seasons 2 and 3 showed China Beach envy syndrome, or something, and that the show declined as a result. But the first season in Hawaii was very well done, in my opinion. As for the music, I never saw the original series. But I do think that the score compliments the action, very well, on these DVDs. And to include the old 60s music, the greatest hits in fact, might only have served to call attention to the datedness and era, rather than the timeless decisions, situations and struggles faced by soldiers.",1175904000,2,1292,4.564655172413793

You will become one with the squad in the first season of this series and your emotions will run high in each episode.

2045322,5,B0001Z3I12,"Since I was young, I had always been intrigued by war.  I was never as interested in the violence as I was by the people who fought the wars.  Every veteran I have ever spoken with had a story they were willing to share and something in the war that made them smile.  Tour of Duty was the first movie or TV show I saw that showed what I was interested in, stories about people who fought the war without graphic violence getting in the way.

I used to watch Tour of Duty religiously when it was aired on TV and I still had VHS recordings of the show that were old, dark, and worn out.  I was ecstatic to find Tour of Duty again on DVD.  Tour of Duty follows the men of Bravo Company during the Vietnam War.  Going beyond the violence, it discusses what affected the soldiers and how the men coped with the war.  Topics that the show addressed were topics that people never seemed to speak about.  For example, one episode shows the journey of a war protester forced to actively fight in the war.  Another, shows a solider who accidentally shoots a child.  There is also a great episode that talks about wounded/disabled soldiers who were shipped back to a hospital in Hawaii and the affect the war and their injuries had on the life of a disabled soldier after the war.

By today's standards, the acting in Tour of Duty is only average.  However, the show is outstanding considering only a few actors made a name for themselves prior to the series and only a few are still ""visible"" in Hollywood since the series.  Looking through the credits, it is kind of neat to see some of the guest stars that appeared on the show such as David Allen Grier, Tia Carrere, Ving Rhames, Tim Thomerson, and Everett McGill, some of whom were on the show before they were big, some on during their fall from stardom.

The DVDs are lacking the original music score, which has been replaced by a somewhat cheesy series of instrumentals.  I think this does take away from the show a little, but the drama and messages in the shows are still there.

If you are like me and was a big fan of the show, this is a definite must have.  Otherwise, if you are looking for an excellent portrayal of the people and issues soldiers face in war, the Tour of Duty series would be an excellent addition to your video library.",1133740800,2,2291,4.338028169014085

Let me say, I am greatly enjoying the show again...it is one of the best series ever, and i've been watching and buying LOTS of dvd series that i enjoy.  I now only wish i hadn't let all the negetive reviews hold me off for so long.

TOD is a wonderfully written and wonderfully acted show, and it holds up well compared to many other shows from my youth. It is great to be watching Zeke and the crew again.

Even more, the music isn't at all bad. It is growing on me actually and i like it.  My wife, who had never watched the show before, even commented that she likes it, even the music. Then i told her some of it (the music) had been changed, and she noted that she would have never known.

One of the things that made this a great series was how it related what was going on over there to our lives here through the same music.  The soundtrack now sounds like someone sat down with a computer and created techno music that should have been used in another bad Karate Kid sequel.

I love the series but hate what happened to the music - it was all a part of the story.  Now, at times when there should be suspenseful music or something quiet you have these techno guitar riffs and peppy techno music.

  Forgive me, but I'm not a purist when it comes to the quality of the DVDs that others sometimes take issue with here in these reviews.  For me, it was just fine and the audio was superb. I do wish they had been able to keep the original songs though.

  As you are putting your faith in ""the President"" and his top flight ""cabinet"" don't forget that a guy named Johnson (a Dem) and a guy named Nixon (a Repub) sold us this bill of goods and it all sounded just fine -- for a while -- back in the 60s.

2045337,3,B0001Z3I12,"I fell in love with ToD when originally broadcast, and disovered 30-40 episodes on some old videotapes in my crawlspace.  After viewing them for the first time in many years, I was about to donate or discard them--until I read so many reviews crticizing the recent DVD release.

My intent was to purchase ToD on DVD, but I've decided to keep my old tapes.  Two out out of three of ToD's most notable attributes (acting and storylines) may have remained intact, but I definitely miss the original music.

ToD fans appear to be largely segregated into two factions:  hard-core military junkies who are mildly annoyed--but not entirely alienated, for the most part--by the new musical score; and hard-core cultural junkies who feel betrayed by the DVD production company, who's executive-level marketing decisions compromised the show's artistic integrity.

I'm not sure where I belong, but I'm glad I've been able to retrieve many of the original shows on tape.  (Unfortunately, I've re-recorded over some, but have now decided to keep the rest.)

Perhaps we should look at things a little philosophically.  The series' broadcast format, with all it's wonderful music, is like so much of our experience in life.  We can't relive the past, but even if we could, we'd discover that it rarely conforms to our embilished recollections.

I suspect that many viewers would find the remastered series to represent, in large measure, the sum and substance of the original broadcast version.  Hopefully, the original music will be added at some point, but are there enough ""cultural junkies"" willing to pay a premium to relive a memory?",1126742400,2,1625,5.044943820224719

2045346,5,B0001Z3I12,"'Tour of Duty' is one of my favourite televisions series. It didn't last very long, but while it did, it presented a fairly realistic depiction of life in a squad of soldiers in Vietnam. Together with the series 'China Beach', it began to open doors to a difficult subject for the American public to deal with -- the American public, after all, got to see the Vietnam war almost live, day by day, year after year, in their homes on the television sets, the first war for that to happen. The controversial nature of the war and 'peace' aftermath made dealing with the subject tricky, but the writing, acting and direction in this series was superb.

The story follows an infantry company 'in-country', Company B, that is made up of a typical mixture of young, green recruits (often draftees) and a few experienced leaders, on their one-year tour of duty in Vietnam; the series began (and this video begins) in 1967, one of the early hot years of the conflict. The base is a typical firecamp, nicknamed Ladybird, with bunkers, sandbags, jungle surroundings, and lots of mud.

Stars of the series include many second-tier Hollywood film and television actors, who are all much better actors than their stature might indicate. Key figures included experienced and battle-hardened Sgt. Zeke Anderson (portrayed by Terence Knox, who has been star or guest star on dozens of television series) and relatively-new officer Lt. Myron Goldman (Stephen Caffrey, soap opera star also noted for some quality film work), as they work together to guide a group of men through the literal and metaphorical minefields of the Vietnam war. Other actors include Eric Bruskotter, Joshua Maurer, Kevin Conroy, Stan Foster, and Tony Becker.

In the pilot to the series, the men have a mission to destroy a hidden NVA base headquarters. It depicts the struggles and stress of jungle combat, and portrays the relationships built under fire by the men who come to depend upon each other for their lives.

The soundtrack takes a similar device from other Vietnam-era shows and films, that of using music contemporary with the conflict. 'Paint It Black' is the opening theme, an ironic and appropriate song and lyric. Beware, however, if you get it on DVD, that this soundtrack has been altered, including the very riveting opening.

This is a superb piece on a troubled time in American history.",1122940800,2,2367,4.9223057644110275
2045357,1,B0001Z3I12,"When I watch a TV show, I want it to draw me into the story.  I want production value (which shows how much the producers value their viewers).  I want a story I care about.  For me, this one had none of these qualities.

  The show's sound track should underscore the show.  This show's dated music is an unwelcome intrusion.

  Perhaps too long a time has passed and too many people gave homecoming soldiers crap for fighting in Viet Nam, but I found the show too uninteresting to go on watching past the pilot episode.

  Synopsis of the pilot:  The non-conformist combat veteran travels from the front line to headquarters to pick up a handful of soldiers to replenish those that have been previously lost.  They experience the highly unlikely event of a straying soldier discovering a weapons cache and enemy headquarters.  A firefight ensues.  Guess who wins the battle.

  This is a highly rated show; it was not canceled after the first season.  I question its realism as I have witnessed explosions (and soldiers) first hand and have actually set foot in asia.",1121817600,,1069,4.701086956521739

Lovejoy had this problem.  They used in three different episodes Nights in White Satin by the Moody Blues (shame on your Justin Heyward and gang!!) and they song had to be removed.

But wow...Paint It Black by The Stones immediately set the tone of this show.  The harddriving song hit the market.  It was perfect.  Yes, it's just the music, the marvelous acting is still there, the underrated powerhouse of Terence Knox, gritty realistic stories that touched the heart.  But the music was a PART of that era, it evokes the whole mindset and to remove it really does this a bad disservice to this brilliant show.

Shame on them for cutting corners and saving a few bucks.

Yes, the stories are so compelling, the acting without fault.  Sad this series ran on CBS, a US channel never know for backing it's series and giving them a really strong chance to prove themselves.  Tour of Duty and China Breach - and the music that went with them truly speak for a period in history.

And I was never more sincere in my writing than when I placed the same song over the helicopter flying away, leaving the boys behind at the end.  I haven't seen this DVD, mainly out of fear that those two moments have been ruined by replacement of the song in each case by generic music.  How did the studio handle those moments?

2045360,5,B0001Z3I12,"I have not seen the DVD seasons, although I watched the broadcasts. In regards to the music changes, somebody's missing something when they complain about the music score on the DVD seasons. Jaggar or Hendrix have nothing to do with the morals that the writer is trying to convey to the audience. The music merely adds an emotional element to the film. We can't forget about the horror and ultimate sacrifices that our men and women endured. They are all heros, in my opinion. That is what the writer is trying to show, the facts. A glimps into a small portion of the Vietnam war (police action). The deaf see the real picture and writers try to create a film that communicates to all the veiwers. Was Hendrix or Jaggar in the Vietnam war? The songs they wrote during that era seemed to have insight into the solders experience, but where did they get the knowledge needed to relate to it! Don't get me wrong, I love the music also. Never the less, Tour of Duty is an excellent series.

2045361,3,B0001Z3I12,The First depiction of the ace's high American soldier in the vietnam war. The first season centeres around a tour in the jungle or vietcong territory for a group of fearless soldiers in a platoon lead by Stephen caffrey  and Terrance knox his second in command. The first season focuses on infantry men who represent the different racial backgrounds in America with some story lines devoted to that fact of that era. Although that fact has nothing to do with reason's of the cause of the Vietnam war the episodes are based on Mission's accomplished by the platoon for the benefit of mankind and exclusion of tyrany in a new more fruitful democratic earth. The first season has it's up's and down's although not hugely grapic and not hugely exciting with combat action  some huge lesson's can be learnt from this series about justice for the oppressed and respect for the brave women and men that conqured the oppressors in such uncharted territory. The platoon of men bond as a group in the first season which is important as friendships are tested to the limit with survival depending on each others training and determination to live while being pinned down by the enemy. The First season is a worthy buy but i hope that season two can achieve a higher star rating than season one.,1109203200,2,1284,4.702222222222222

The show was so good that it's still good work without the music, but the music, especially The Stones' ""Black"" in the intro really got you into the mood.  I was shopping with a Christmas gift certificate, saw the first two seasons and grabbed them.  It never occurred to me that the music might not be part of the package.  What the heck is going on here?  It's like Miami Vice would be without the music, still pretty good but not at all the same.  I'm sorry I bought the dvd's.

2045364,5,B0001Z3I12,"Tour of Duty - my staple Saturday night viewing in the late 80s when it was shown on TV in the U.K. I absolutely loved this show, which not only boasted some great characters, superb and pretty gritty action sequences, but actually dared to go explore a great many themes of the war in a pretty unbiased way. I've been waiting a long time for a DVD release, and finally it's got one! The main issue here seems to be the fact that the music has been changed, and it has. Yes there's no Paint It Black on the opening credits - but the music is not as 'generic' as people say. It's actually the end theme, and theme that was used throughoput the show that starts it off. The music through the episodes is thematically decent (i.e Hendrix style guitar tracks, and bluesy riffs etc) that don't sound out of place - they're just not instantly recognisable - and it takes NOTHING away from the sheer brilliance of this series. Given the choice - yes I would rather have the original musics, but given the choice between what has been released, and nothing - it's a no contest. If it's a case of a company needing to avoid royalties in order to get me the complete seasons of a great TV series - I'm all for it, and any true fan will tell you the same.",1105574400,3,1244,4.253164556962025

  It's very unfortunate that the original music is not there.  If I can ""steal"" all these songs off the net in mp3 format, why the heck can't studios secure the rights for the original music?  Seems so backwards to me.  A job done poorly.

And every rock song that was played!  How in the WORLD could they duplicate the episode wherein the platoon is with the 'Vietamese Indians' with the AWOL US soldier and they perform for them using a James Brown tune???  Remember ToD fans?  Goldman puts a cape over Taylor and guides him 'offstage'...GREAT episode!  Will they just SKIP this episode?  Kinda hard for Taylor to lip synch James Brown with muzak playing..Or the episode where they rescue a USO troup and 'We Gotta Get Outta This Place' plays at the end, trailing off into an echo, as the chooper takes off showing the platoon on a hilltop from the air??  It will hardly have the same impact without the song!

And why no extras??  Ive seen web sites all over the web where actors from the series do 'chats', so why would they be opposed to adding their viewpoint, interviews, behind the scenes stuff, etc?  I waited so so so long to upgrade my my nearly worn out tapes only to find no extras and NO ORIGINAL music?  ACK!

2045378,5,B0001Z3I12,"It's about time this series made it to DVD.  One of the top series of the 1980's (ok - that's my opinion)this was one of 2 series to hit the small screen about the Viet Nam war, the other being China Beach.  It came out at about the time it was ok to be nostalgic about a war that seemingly went on forever with a number of big-screen flicks on the war also coming out about the same time.  Terence Knox was ideally cast as Sgt. Zeke Anderson, and if  you were one of those people unfortunate enough to have been there, or knew someone who was, you know it was really the wizened-battle hardened sergeant who ran the platoon and not the lieutenant who was in charge.

With a cast featuring a number of minorities the show may have been a bit ahead of its time which might explain why it only lasted a few years.  One thing to remember about Viet Nam was that it was the minority groups that made up a large percentage of the troops.

Musically, the soundtrack will bring back some memories although some of the tunes on the original series have been replaced due to copyright difficulties.  No big deal since its the storylines that make the program and the music- while certainly not a distraction - adds that '60's flavor to it.

I served in the US Army from June 1970 to May 1973 during a time in our history that was the Cold War. I volunteered for service in Viet Nam but was instead sent to Germany as part of a much bigger picture of the war that was being fought against Communism. I am however proud to say that our guys who were called to fight in Viet Nam were the braviest of us all. This series was and is dedicated to them and the music only represents a very tiny part of the times. I highly recommend this series to all who thought it was great at the time of its run on TV regardless of the change in the music. If I want to listen to the music I can always put CD's on my sterio while I watch Tour of Duty over and over again.

When this set came out I'd waited so long for a DVD release I bought it anyway. What a mistake!! Without the rock music it's practically unwatchable!! The show's writers masterfully used 1960's rock music not only to compliment the scene, but also to help tell the story, sometimes with music that sarcastically contrasted with the events unfolding on screen (like the use of ""Train A' Coming"" in episode 3). You wouldn't watch ""Apocoplyse Now"" without ""Satisfaction,"" and watching ""Tour of Duty"" in this version is no different.

2045396,4,B0001Z3I12,"""Tour of Duty"" came on TV in 1987, a time in which Hollywood began to address the Vietnam War with a deluge of movies, many of them memorable, others not. ""Tour of Duty"" was unique in that it lacked the sensationalized stories of films like ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket,"" but it was also missing the realistic, graphic battle scenes of the later ""We Were Soldiers."" ""Tour of Duty"" focused on a company of young men in Vietnam, beginning in 1967. The episodes revolve around the camraderie and teamwork of the men, their attitudes towards the war, their inner frustrations, and ultimately the bold actions that keep them alive. The attitudes, feelings, and exploits of the Vietnamese forces (NVA, VC, and ARVN) are also examined.

 Strong acting all-around gives life to the characters. In particular, viewers can see Sgt. Anderson (Terrence Knox) as a father figure to the young infantrymen, and watch Lt. Goldman (Stephen Caffrey) as he develops his leadership abilities over the course of the show.

 The plots of the episodes range in quality from average to excellent. In the best episodes, viewers feel genuine suspense and develop a sense of despair from watching the soldiers of Bravo Company fight for their lives. Of all the first season episodes, a few really stand out: ""Notes from the Underground,"" ""Brothers, Fathers, and Sons,"" ""Nowhere to Run,"" ""Roadrunner,"" ""Under Siege,"" and ""Soldiers."" However, none of the episodes are really bad.

 The weakest aspect of this DVD was the music. The original show played popular songs from the Vietnam era at various points in the episodes. For the DVD, a composer tried to substitute instrumental versions of these songs. Often, they come on at inappropriate times and detract from the mood of the scene. Disappointingly, the show's original theme song (""Paint It, Black"" by The Rolling Stones) has been purged from the show. The instrumental closing theme has been substituted instead.

 As a DVD compilation, this collection is average in terms of conversion to the DVD format. All 21 episodes from the first season are here (including the pilot episode, which reveals significant retooling took place before episode 2.) There aren't any special features, aside from trailers for other DVD's being sold by Columbia Tristar.

 Overall, this is a solid but under-appreciated TV show that has finally made it to DVD to be enjoyed by new generations. I can't wait for seasons 2 and 3 to show up on DVD.",1091404800,5,2458,4.987775061124695

That said, the DVDs of season 1 are very well packaged, and the quality of transfer to DVD is excellent.  They are well worth buying.

The lack of any extras *is* annoying.  I wonder if good old Columbia/Tristar bothered to even talk to any of the actors?  Or the creators of the show?

TOD manages to tell meaningful stories about world-shattering events on a personal level, without resorting to melodrama or overblown special effects.  This tv show compares well with the best of the big screen, where characters and plot are often sacrificed for big explosions and fancy camera work.

  I think it should be re-released with a trade-in program.  I was kind of expecting the shows to seem cheesy and outdated now 15yrs later, but its just as great now as it was then.  Well, everything but the music.  I can live with the video quality (this IS 80's TV after all; better than my vhs tapes of the show, though - its all relative) and the graininess of the low-light filming parts, but the music is unacceptable.

I encourage the producers to  include the origional music on the subsequent seasons to insure positive reviews and sales. I was in Vietnam in 1963 and TOD was my show during the 80s when it became cool to be a Vietnam vet.  I especially enjoyed the last season when the squad was assigned to SOG. As far as I'm concerned this is our show and we would like to see the music of our era included.  This series reflected in some ways the way we felt in country and when we came home. I should point out that the cast would travel to Vietnam reunions and events to make an appearance on behalf of the show. It was very gratifying to see these young actors pay tribute to those of us who were really there. Please do not abandon this series just because you don't like the music and allow the subsequent series to not be released. Funny, isn't that what happened with the war in Vietnam? We were not allowed to continue and win the war because people disagreed. Sounds like history repeating itself.

2045431,5,B0001Z3I12,"Although I suppose I shouldn't be, I am continually amazed that people would give 100% negative reviews based on music rights not being negotiated.
Yes, its not entirely the same show without the music.  Yes some scenes loose their initial effectiveness (or even don't make sense - see the references to Marvin Gaye playing on the radio when the music has been replaced by muzak).  However, I found that after the first few shows, I didn't miss the music anymore - indeed without it, I found myself concentrating more on what was going on, the nuances of the characters and their reactions to each situation, instead of tapping my foot to the music.
I'd go so far as to say ToD might be a better show without the songs, if you watch it as a commentary about the issues surrounding the Vietnam period of US history.
In the first season, the show had the support of the US Armed Forces, and it showed - equipment and for most of the season, the focus was on the war.  Later episodes of the season began to focus more on the characters and the effect of being in Vietnam had on them as people.  The best example of this is in Short Timer, where Taylor is faced with the realization that Vietnam is where he belongs, and ""re-ups"" when he could be going home at the end of his tour.  The observation is made that this makes him a ""lifer"".
I loved this show when it was first on CBS.  For the longest time, I hoped it would be released on VHS, but then DVD came along and I knew that with the growing popularity of TV on DVD, it was only a matter of time before ToD was released.
The thing is, if sales are low for season one, the other two might not be released.

Main complaints are the music a a few grainy scenes, which by the way, were like that on the original transmission, but the actual show itself is A+ quality.
So, if you are a fan and want seasons 2 and 3 released, but know someone who gave a poor review because of the music, or isn't buying, be sure to thank them if the rest of the show isn't released (see NYPD Blue for what can happen if sales are poor).",1089763200,,2067,4.217721518987342

2045434,3,B0001Z3I12,"I've read with interest all the reviews and viewpoints on this new release. It's an obvious statement on the popularity of this show to see such a reponse. I see both sides of the music argument, and if it doesn't bother you to see the original score removed, then more power to you. But I'm joining all the others who are not buying this release. I just found out it was released and was so excited that I had been jumping back and forth between Ebay and Amazon to find the best deal. Then I decided to read the reviews just to make sure, and I'm glad I did. After always being dissapointed by the sound track changes on the TNT TV versions, I had eagerly awaited a release on DVD by the studio, certain they would release it in its true, original form. I was a Huey door gunner just after Vietnam (shooting at dead tanks at Fort AP Hill makes me a lot less braver than my older brethern getting shot at over the rice patties in Vietnam), and there was nothing that made my hair stand up on the back of my neck like the opening scenes of TOD with ""Paint It Black"" turned way up high. That one song being taken out is enough for me not to buy the DVD. For me, and like many others who have commented, the music is an integral part of the scenes. The writing and acting was great, but the overall effect just isn't the same when the music is changed. However, I'm not certain I buy into the conspiracy theories being floated about regarding the licensing. Several years ago, while TNT was running TOD every day, one of the TOD web sites reported that the Stones refused to negotiate a licensing agreement, and that was why there was a different opening. Not sure how accurate that is and it seems strange that all the bands associated with the original soundtrack would take the same stand. Regardless, I have all 3 seasons on VHS that I recorded off the TV, and I watch them regularly. They have the commercials, they don't have Paint It Black, and the picture isn't great. But the new DVD has little more than all that, so I'm saving my money. Hopefully sales will be dissapointing to the studio and they will reconsider their strategy.",1088985600,84,2137,4.345

TNT says the reason for theese changes were due to requests from the government in light of the September 11 attacks.

I was thinking about purchasing the DVD's, but after seeing the reviews here I've decided not to.  I disagree (at least in theory, since I didn't see that much of the show) that the lack of the original soundtrack wouldn't make that much of a difference - of course the songs were used in the first place exactly because the producers KNEW they would greatly enhance the realism of the show.  Perhaps the licensing fees for the DVD's were deemed too expensive by Tristar, or perhaps the licensing was simply unavailable in some cases.  What bothers me is that the company didn't tell prospective buyers that on the packaging of the DVD.  Obviously they guessed a lot of fans wouldn't buy the set knowing that up front, so they chose to not say anything and see how many people they could sucker.  That really is a ripoff, and I think Tristar SUCKS for doing that.  I am a musician myself, and for the studio to treat the original musical concept and tapestry of the show so cavalierly is unacceptable - even if the added new tracks by the composer are well done, as I'm sure they are, and if the other aspects of the show are still good (it's also a bit disturbing to read that the DVD picture quality is sub-par).

I served in Nam for 18 months 1966-1968 and found when viewing the season one release, that the music, like the theme song ""Paint it Black"" added a lot to the overall feeling of the period.

Sometimes I would fall asleep and wake up again only to see the ending credits. We didn't have the internet back then and television programming was incredibly limited and restricted in the UK. Most of it was so dull I would consider it hard work watching it now. However, Tour of Duty was one of the few programmes that was truly entertaining and engaging. Watching it again now brings on feelings of nostalgia and the ending credits still take me back to that time of my youth.

Needless to say it was very disappointing to learn that this release does not have the original soundtrack which really made the series great. The music rights should have already been secured when the program was first aired. Despite this glaring omission the DVD box set is superb, the reproduction quality is as good as when I first saw the program. I would have loved to see some behind the scenes footage but at the end of the day I am very grateful that they have released the collection.

First was the development of the characters, then it was the way the covered individual episodes from all angles and all situations, There was the action and the drama.  This show was a vision of men in combat, banding together to survive.  For the Glory of war is to live through it to get home.  Here was a very accurate depiction of some incredibly good acting and themes that should be on DVD.  It showed what our fighting men had to go through just to survive day by day.  The only thing they learned to depend on was each other.  I am now waiting for the second season.... Enjoy and learn what war is really about.",1087689600,,1210,4.3053097345132745
2045459,2,B0001Z3I12,"I have been waiting for the release of this series.  However, without the orginal music, the sense, the very essence, of the message - the turbulent times, the hopelessness, the shear insanity of it all can not be accurately portrayed.  Therefore, unless or, until the orginal music is part of the series, I will not buy this set.",1087689600,9,330,4.672413793103448
2045460,4,B0001Z3I12,"This is a great series and it is great to see it out on DVD.  The video quality is fairly good, for the most part, considering the series is 15+ years old.  There are episodes where the quality varies within the same scene, but it seems like I remember that in the orginal run, too.
The major disappointment is the lack of appropriate 60's music.  The title sequence uses the shows theme, which is not bad, but certainly not as good as the Stones' Paint It Black.  Also, there are small segments in most of the episodes that were clearly used to showcase 60's hits, but have now been replaced by generic instrumental music.  The original music played a big part in setting the scene and mood of the series.  In ""Sitting Ducks"", the song ""Louie, Louie"" is used as part of a scene, and it immediately seems like the 60s.
In another episode, characters are listening to a radio and talking about the Marvin Gaye song apparently playing, but we hear generic 60s-esque music.
It is unfortunate that music nearly 40 years old cannot be licensed for this excellent series.  Hopefully, the future seasons will contain more of the original music.  At any rate, it is still a great series and fun to watch again after all these years.",1087689600,3,1224,4.531818181818182

Come on guys, on the next DVD bring back the original music.",1087516800,,363,3.918918918918919
2045462,4,B0001Z3I12,"This is a great tv war series, second only to Combat! What was very disappointing about the DVD, is the absence of the 60's music that laced the entire series. Especially disconcerting is the missing opening Stones' Paint It Black. The music set the entire tone of the series. If the stories and characters weren't so excellent, I would say try and find copies of the original broadcast episodes. Maybe they can acquire the rights to the music and charge a little more for the set.",1087344000,2,481,4.604651162790698
2045463,4,B0001Z3I12,"I must echo a previous reviewer about the TOUR OF DUTY SEASON ONE DVD set. If you love the show, please buy the set anyway.
As a viewer who came to TOUR OF DUTY only in TNT syndication, I never experienced the show with the 60s music that was part of the soundtrack. But even with that music removed and replaced by Conlan's (rather good and unfairly maligned) score, the show is powerful and well-realized in every way. This was one of the greatest dramatic series in all TV history. Its only rival, in terms of war-themed drama, might be COMBAT, a magnificent series that is also coming to DVD this summer.
Rights to the music originally used in these episodes were probably only licenced for the original broadcasts, partly, if not largely, because of cost. For future airings, replacement music had to be used. While hearing the great songs of Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye and others surely added immeasurably to the mood TOUR OF DUTY, the show does not truly suffer in its current form.
The episodes (including the pilot) look quite good in DVD format. Curiously, they have chapter stops, but there is no chapter menu. It's great to have the show uncut and without commercial interruption.
It would have been good to have some extras, like interviews with the cast, directors, writers, etc, but the price is fairly reasonable for this much quality in its presentation.
Please don't boycott TOUR OF DUTY on DVD, or we will be stuck with Seasons 2 & 3 on commercial-plagued videotapes.",1087344000,7,1488,4.726923076923077

Yes, the original music would have been an asset, however it is the powerful content/subject matter that really makes the statement of how it was for our troops.  TOD's gripping stories and interactions of the characters portray profound realism in what my husband encountered ""in country""!  The actors involved in this series can be proud of their involvement in this project!  This is not to be missed by anyone interested in the Vietnam conflict - even without the original soundtrack!

As much as I had looked forward to owning ""Tour of Duty"" on DVD I refuse to buy it unless it features the original soundtrack. It just wouldn't be the real thing.

2045469,1,B0001Z3I12,"This is a warning for all fans of the television classic 'Tour of Duty'. This DVD release DOES NOT contain the show you know and love. All music from the soundtrack has been removed, presumably for copyright reasons, and replaced by generic stock music, rendering the show almost unwatchable. This is unacceptable from a company whose sales last financial year grossed $6.7 billion (source: Sony Pictures Corporate Fact Sheet).
A previous reviewer mentioned the importance of the music, likening its removal to taking 'Ride of the Valkyries' out of Apocalypse Now. He couldn't be more right. In fact, Tour of Duty had such a classic mix of great songs that it got it's own soundtrack CD release here in Australia in 1992.
I have sent an email to Sony Pictures Home Video customer service department CTHV_CustomerService@spe.sony.com - I have asked for the email address of someone responsible for the DVD release, if I get this, I will post it in a subsequent review. I encourage all fans to boycott this release and email complaints to Sony Pictures.
As soon as I became aware of the nature of this DVD release (about 1 minute in to the first episode, where I noticed the Rolling Stones 'Paint it Black' was REMOVED from the opening titles) I returned it to my retailer. I just hope you can do the same.",1087084800,3,1304,4.748898678414097

2045471,1,B0001Z3I12,"Like many other fans, I remember this show from when it originally aired.  I was a fan of Terence Knox, having been impressed with his work on ""St. Elsewhere"" and was looking forward to seeing what he'd do with this new series.  I really enjoyed the first season, although I lost interest in later seasons.
But I was excited to hear about the DVD release and eagerly preordered it.  At the time I didn't know about the music.  When I received my set, I opened the first disc and put it in the player and was so crushed when I didn't hear ""Paint it Black"" as the opening theme that I simply couldn't watch the show.  I would return it, but I realize this isn't Amazon's fault.  I just wish I'd known at the time that I ordered it that I'd be getting a bastardized version.  The period music was an integral part of the show.  I can't believe they would have the nerve to release this on DVD with generic Muzak in place of Hendrix, the Stones and other classic rock pieces.  It's an insult to fans.
I give the show 5 stars, but the DVD release zero.  Too bad Amazon won't let me rate it zero stars.  Columbia/Tristar should be offering refunds to us for this, or at least print warnings on the packaging.
As for me, I guess I'll stick with my 17 year old videotapes, which may not have DVD image quality but they at least have the right music.  And Columbia/Tristar - offering a refund to fans and promising a release with the right music would be a good way to make up for this debacle.  Also, more extras on the discs, like interviews with the actors, would be nice.  But the music's the important thing.  Whoever came up with this release should be fired.
And despite what some reviewers have said, ""Paint it Black"" was used as the theme song from the very beginning.  I have the pilot episode, taped off the air in 1987 when it premiered on CBS, and it and the rest of the season open with the music of the Rolling Stones.",1086912000,16,1924,4.273480662983426

If Oliver Stone's Platoon or Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is on your shelf then this should be right next to it.  This is life in the bush.  I watched it when I was a kid every now and then, and watched the re-runs religiously when I was old enough to appreciate it. If your sceptical about buying this season, rent a disc and I guarantee you will think 35 dollars is a bargain. Vietnam was a sad time, but atleast with programs like this we can learn to appreciate what so many did for our country.",1086825600,,599,4.016806722689076

2045474,5,B0001Z3I12,"First of all, posting one or two stars all because some of the original music was not left in is nonsense. This was not WKRP in Cincinnati, it is a war series, and a very well done one. If you want music buy the originals on CD, put your headphones on and have a blast. Who cares!!! I am sure most will purchase this because of the content, the acting, and the action. Next to Combat! with Vic Morrow (going to DVD also in July), this is one excellent series, cut off in its prime three years later. Then again, so was Star Trek, and look at the legacy of that short series today with movie sequels. If you want action, great acting, and a sense of realism as to how it was in wartime Vietnam purchase this series! To the ones that withheld the copyrights give up the battle, all that music is right on the net anyway. No withholding of music will make me not purchase the Tour of Duty full set. Also it would be great to see these guys make a final movie and closure to this fine series.",1086652800,,988,4.124352331606218

The show is definately worth 5 stars, but this dvd set loses points for the soundtrack.
I'll probably still buy it, since Zeke Anderson as portrayed by Terry Knox is one of my favorite tv characters. And even without the classic soundtrack, the show is still very good. But for those of us who lived through that time, the songs used in the original soundtrack really brought it home.
I've heard they changed the soundtrack because of the royalty cost of using all those songs, but I'd gladly pay more to have them included. I just spent $100 on the second season of Voyager, and I wouldn't hesitate to spend that much for Tour of Duty with the original soundtrack.",1085270400,6,998,4.581005586592179
