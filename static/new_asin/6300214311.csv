257110,3,6300214311,"Part 2 SIDEBAR:  The last movie ended as Ginny (Amy Steel; April Fools Day, Friday the 13th Part 2) discovered the severed head shrine to Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer; Friday the 13th Parts 1 & 2) and impersonated her to fool Jason. But after our relief from Jasons defeatSURPRISE!  Hes still alive with a machete deeply embedded in his torso!

We open by replaying the last 5 minutes of part 2 as an elaborate recap and pick up part III the very next day.  So, with part 1 occurring in present day (1980) and part 2 occurring 5 years later (1985), this also occurs in 1985.

Having recovered from his horrible injury from part 2 (1980), Jason (Richard Brooker, 63; Deathstalker) has come back meaner and bigger (part 2s Warrington Gillette, 61) to harass more horny lakeside twentysomethings. Oddly, these victims are neither campers no camp staff.  Some mentionables from the cast include Rachel Howard (Deep Space), Dana Kimmell (Sweet Sixteen), Kevin O'Brien (Warlock) and Catherine Parks (Looker).

Ever-tougher Jason SIDEBAR:  Jason is still clearly human (as he was in part 2).  He dresses human, acts rather human (although homicidal), dives out of the path of cars, limps when hes hurt, and is injured by stab wounds.  Hes bigger and uglier than before, but still human.  Although, he does somehow survive being hangedwhich is about as remarkable as surviving his machete-embedded torso in part 2.  He even appears to survive an axe to the headbut that was presented as perhaps a dream.

After introducing us to Jason Voorhees, Steve Miner (Friday the 13th Part 2, Warlock, House, Halloween H20, Lake Placid) returns for his second sequel with the popularity of the franchise garnering ever-enlarging budgets ($550K in 80, $1.25M in 81, and now $2.3M in 82).  However, despite this, I was quite underwhelmed with the movie.

This sequel is not just the campiest so far, its simply crass.  There are pooping sound effects (yes, pooping!), sex and shower scenes, needless punks, unexciting kills, horrendous dialogue and perhaps the lamest 3D ploys in history largely limited to simply holding things in front of the camera (e.g., passing a joint).  The death scenes were largely stale, although I almost enjoyed the spear gun kill, the handstand death provoked a stupid giggle and who doesnt like an eye-popping head crush (the only appropriate use of 3D in the movie).

It seemed that so much attention was afforded to making (now) idiotic things 3D, that no attention went to making the movie any fun.  Despite all the 3D hullabaloo and having its moments, and I do mean only moments, this movie was really boring for its first 50 minutes and slightly less boring for the last 40 minutes.  I mean, we see Jason way too often (opening and shutting doors, ooooooh scaaaary) and it never seems to matter.  In the final act we see him scuffling about in lame barn skirmishes like a clumsy street fighter.

The only definitive good to come from this sequel was Jasons discovery of the hockey mask.  As iconic as the mask is to the character, its a sad irony that it was founded in such a circumstantially silly manner and in such a weak movie.  The best part of the movie was the surprise ending which plays on the stylings of the previous two movies, both of which had greater impact than this.  Ill admit this is probably more rewatchable than part 1its just less significant and it pales to part 2.  This may be the worst in the series.",1508198400,,3443,4.773648648648648

You have to kind of relax into it, let your brain adjust to the colours.
I'm just aching for them to release a proper polarized 3d version (like Jaws 3D -wow the 3D is incredible in that one), but for the time being, this will do.
There's nothing like seeing it at the cinema, what a great memory.  Up there with House of Wax and The Bubble in terms of 3D quality.
A 3D and horror classic.

257129,5,6300214311,"You guys just don't get do you the first two Friday the 13th movies were meant to be a tragedy about revenge, so the directing style was pretty basic, however the third movie was to be completely different. First the victims are not teens there young adults in about there early twenties, second they style of the director in this installment was to build up tension with jump scares which is why the 3-D was added in a attempted to maximize the tension and jump scares not to be a gore fest or porn movie. For its time it was an great movie you cant enjoy this movie at home twenty years or so later with a bad 3-D transfer and judge it that way because if you didn't see the movie in the theaters back in 1982 and 1983 it will come of a cheesy horror movie the effects work on the big screen only... so some of the problems with this movie is that it just cant stand the test of time like a Halloween say but it wasn't meant to it...it was a cash grab movie and they got it right at the time. Now even I have some issues with the movie and that's the continuity in the size of Jason from part two to part three he is huge in the third film other than that the best Friday movie to me.",1500249600,,1186,4.008438818565401

257154,1,6300214311,"I saw this movie in the theater and even though it's just another Jason film, it was one of the best theater experiences I've had... midnight show, packed theater, rowdy crowd having a great time, awesome 3D effects. Of course I expected nothing of the sort in my home, but was hoping to at least have a little fun revisiting a fun movie from my youth. Sadly, the 3D did not translate at all to this version. The previously fantastic opening credits were in 2D and the 3D parts were ghosted so bad the movie was totally unwatchable - about 20 minutes in I had to pull the ripcord. Just so you get the whole picture (excuse the pun) - I watched it on my 60"" 4K LG TV. Image size and equipment quality were not an issue here. I watch 3D movies all the time that look amazing on my set - including the old anaglyph movies (red/blue glasses) like this one.

257189,3,6300214311,"Continued Crystal Lake bloodletting, now with 100% more hockey mask. Characterization has improved from the pitiful showing in Part 2, but that's close to the textbook definition of a backhanded compliment. We still endure some painfully awkward social interactions and idiotic decisions from the cast, and linger too long in their dry, boring daylight scenes. The series has moved past the camp counselor-as-victim model, though it doesn't seem to make much of a difference: these generic teenagers don't behave much differently. Jason continues to be omnipresent, basically signifying a transition point between every scene. Time to move our perspective into the bedroom? Well, let's just cram a shadowy figure or heavy work boot into the end of the preceding shot. Don't forget the trademarked stalking/heavy breathing melody. His problems with closing the deal also persist: the guy is downright psychic for the first dozen kills, but when the number of survivors drops to one or two, all of a sudden he can't get out of his own way. Sloppy and poorly made, like many of the era's horror movies, but also oddly charming for many of the same reasons.",1475798400,,1153,5.105820105820106

Sean states he was very close to the Friday movies directed by Steve Miner, who was a producer on the original. It's a big departure from the first two movies, however. There is no campground and you don't get all the scenes of ambience that you got before. Jason gets his mask here, and his motive for killing seems very weak. But this is still a good slasher and certainly better than Part IV and the rest when it really goes downhill. I've always heard Part III was planned to be the last and I wish it had been. It would have been a near perfect trilogy.",1462752000,2,675,4.2
257230,3,6300214311,"The ""3D"" in this movie is the old-school format of 3D that requires the red/blue glasses (two pair are included in the package).  While this type of 3D will work on any television (it's designed for 2D), it is NOT the 3D format that a 3D television uses.  This was VERY disappointing to us as it made the movie very hard to watch and was a strain on our eyes (my wife and myself) due to the color differences for each eye.  So, while it does have a nostalgic appeal in theory, the 3D effect fails dismally given the technological capabilities we have to make it work much better today.  Thumbs down on the 3D.

HOWEVER, the other aspects of this film are quite good.  It's loaded with extra features (see other reviewers for this)  and the transfer quality of the blu-ray is superb.  As one reviewer pointed out, the widescreen aspect really does give the tone of the movie a much more appropriate atmosphere.  Honestly, if you just ignore the 3D ""feature"" and just purchase it for 2D viewing, this will be a much better experience for you.",1461542400,3,1040,4.4603174603174605

257232,4,6300214311,"The beginning of this movie shows the final battle from the previous chapter:  Ginny finding the old shack with a rough altar with Pamela Voorhees's head on it.  I just love how she was able to impersonate Pamela by putting on the sweater.  Then Jason spots his mother's head on the altar and attacks Ginny. Paul arrives and attacks Jason but is quickly overpowered.  Finally Ginny picks up the machete uses it to save Paul.

This chapter shows that Jason survived his wounds, and is now after a group of  young people spending a weekend at a cabin.  The group includes a nice assortment.  Chris Higgins and her boyfriend Rick.  Debbie and her boyfriend Andy.  A prankster Shelley and his love interest Vera - who doesn't return his feelings. 2 stoners - Chuck and Chili.  Most of the gang are killed, by variety of brutal and bloody assaults.

This chapter has many strong points:  First Jason changes out of his Hillbilly clothes.  Garbing himself in a green shirt,  regular pants, and eventually the Hockey Mask.  The Hockey mask hides his deformities, while showing his bald head.  The Hockey mask would come to be how fans think of Jason.  This movie is the birth of the Hockey Masked Maniac.

Second there's Chris:  She'd been traumatized several years before this.  While out in the woods she'd been attacked by a deformed man, he'd barely been human. Somehow she'd escaped, and had post traumatic stress ever since.  She'd come back to the woods hoping to put that behind her, and to reconnect with Rick.  She doesn't get her wish.

Eventually she finds all her friends killed, and then Rick is also slain.  Next she confronted Jason in the barn.  He chased her up to the 2nd floor.  Chris knocked him out, wrapped a rope around his neck, and shoved him out a window.

To leave the barn Chris had to walk passed him still hanging, but he wasn't dead.  As he reached to remove the rope, his mask was pulled up.  Revealing the face that had haunted her for so long.  She was imploding as Jason came for her, but she managed to bury an ax in his head.  Even with that he still kept coming for a little while, before collapsing.

In the epilogue the police were all over the crime scene.  Jason was presumed dead.  Chris had suffered a complete breakdown.  She alternated between near catatonia, to screaming, to histarical laughter.",1456617600,,2337,4.614634146341463

Where is the stereoscopic 3D format?  I wound up ripping the disc and using a number of AVISynth filters to convert it to stereoscopic, but it's far from perfect.  Don't label a movie product as 3D if it's not stereoscopic, please -- it's not compatible with current 3D tech.",1446076800,,511,4.582417582417582

257264,5,6300214311,"""Dead"" Jason, having survived his attack in the previous movie, gets up and moves on.  And in case we didn't get that, they start this offering by repeating the sweater scene from the previous movie.  We next meet Jason far from who knows where, in an extended sequence about a couple in the middle of nowhere.  Jason takes exception to them being in their own home and promptly kills them; cue the new batch of bodies heading for a weekend retreat in the middle of nowhere.  They almost run over a soothsaying geezer with a pet eyeball.  ""I have warned thee!""  Wouldn't you know it, Jason sets up camp in the very spot the kids are heading for.  What are the odds?  What are the odds that one of them (Dana Kimmell as Chris Higgins) had a previous run-in with Jason when he didn't have a sack to call his own so he could cover his poor offensive head.  It isn't long before strange things start happening, people go missing, and there's nowhere to run.

The novelty with this sequel is that it was shot in 3D.  Naturally, not being clever enough, the filmmakers overuse the same gimmick of thrusting things at the camera (the most irritating repetition being a dope playing with a yo-yo above a girl's head).  None of these silly gimmicks was necessary to the plot.

It should also be noted that they edited out a lot of the carnage for fear of earning an X rating.  I think they should have gone for it in spite of that, I certainly wouldn't have held it against them for making it too graphic.  You can't have too much gore in a slasher flick, that's an oxymoron.",1443744000,4,1566,4.388888888888889
257265,5,6300214311,"By this point the early events include that have led up to this are, Jason's supposed drowning as a child at Camp Crystal Lake in the summer of 1957, the very next year his angry mother Mrs. Voorhees taking a job as a counselor there to kill the counselors who had sex and paid no attention to his having drowned, sole survivor Alice successfully killing Jason's mother before she got killed, Alice trying to hide away, but Jason finds her and kills her, and then we've got a recap of what went on at the end of part 2 with Ginny and her camp owner boyfriend Paul having a rough fight with sack headed Jason, then Ginny grabs a machete and slices his shoulder.  They show Jason pull out the machete weakly and that's it.  Surprisingly, the final cabin scene with them finding Muffin the dog and Jason jumping through the window is excised to move on with this movie's plot.  The opening sequence shows the full title coming out of Mrs. Voorhees's rotting head'd eyes.  The theme song here is without the best ever, sounding sort of ghostly or alien like sort of akin to a theramin and it has a cool dance beat to it.

This time the main chief characters are not going to camp to be counselors, they're going to a location on Crystal Lake for a different reason.

We are now introduced to Harold and Edna, a general store running married couple that are frustrated with eachother that bring the comic strip characters the Lockhorns to mind.  While Harold is busy eating things that are bad for his diet and playing around with the pets in the place, Edna is putting away laundry and watching tv, in particular a news report about the sole survivor from part 2 Ginny.  While this is happening Jason is creeping around in the shadows.  Anyway they come to be Jason's first victims.  Next we get introduced to Andy and his hot babe girlfriend Debbie, Andy's friend and roommate socially awkward horror loving prankster Shelly,  another hot and gorgeous young lady Chris(Dana Kimmell, Sweet Sixteen) Shelly's blind date sizzling hot and super gorgeous Vera, and finally a weird pot smoking hippie couple Chuck and Chili.  As they travel they come accross a hobo sleeping in the middle of the road.  They help him up and not only does he come off like another Crazy Ralph, but he carries around an eyeball.  Needless to say the kids get away from him as fast as possible.  They all go to Chris's family farm Higgins Haven.  Chris thought that she would face her fears due to an incident that happened 2 years before.  Soon upon arrival Chris reunites with her boyfriend Rick.  Rick wants to have sex with Chris but she is still dealing with her fear.  Later on we get introduced to a trio of punk bikers.  There's beautiful, African American, fun loving yet aggressive Fox, token white boy of the 3 Loco who comes off Bruce Willis like, and finally there's the African American male of the group and the most aggressive Ali.  After they give Shelly and Vera a hard time at the local convenience store, Shelly smashes their motorcycles some.  This shows a cool side of Shelly.  Many of the characters get slaughtered and their is some sex going on also, but mostly the characters want to relax and take in their surroundings while supporting Chris.

The score is still by Harry Manfredini.  Harry still delivers on the creepy sounds and music.  The sci-fi element to his score goes a step further, plus he delivers on some tension and mystery as well.  Director Steve Miner continues as the director and really knows what to do.

The atmosphere shows us a beautiful landscape that's well shot for day and night.  The night shots show a well lit night, with some fog thunder and lightning and later on heavy, scary, forboding winds.  Both are shot at night to add to the fear.

The gore is great for the most part boasting some really great kill scenes as well.  Albeit not every kill scene was great, but most of them were.

Jason(Richard Brooker) has his weapons or choice in his arsenal.  His weapons are: a meat cleaver, a machete, an axe, a speargun, a hot fire poker, his bare hands and 2 pitchforks.  The best thing is this movie is the debut of the iconic hockey mask.  That became Jason's trademark mask for the rest of the series.  Very influential move!

The acting is some of the best with occasional awkward moments.  The characters are very likable and relatable.  The character development is very strong as well.  Some of them are really funny too.  I could definitely relate to Shelly, with his low self-esteem, social awkwardness, and feeling unable to get a girlfriend.  That was me in high school.

A couple of my favorite kill scenes are, Jason firing a speargun to the eye of one of his victims and another victim getting stabbed with a hot fire poker.

My least favorite kill scene was the victim getting his head crushed until his eye pops out like a cuckoo bird out of a cuckoo clock.  That gore effect was just too fake looking to be sure.

Overall, you get more beautiful and sexy people, tension filled and creepy music, great gore and mostly great kill scenes, relatable, likable and funny characters that are well developed, it's very good nostalgia, great cinematography, well paced, and best of all it's the debut of the famous hockey mask.

257303,4,6300214311,"This review contains a review of the movie and the HD streaming quality.  Semi-spoiler alert, but nothing major.

MOVIE:
The movie represents a significant event in the franchise history:  Jason gets his hockey mask!  The events of this film begin the day after Jenny is carried off in the stretcher at the end of ""Friday the 13th: Part II.""  Chris invites her friends to go to her parent's lake house, which just happens to be in the vicinity of Camp Crystal Lake.  She is eager to forget the events that happened two years ago where she was attacked in the woods by a younger unmasked Jason.  The typical pattern of the franchise then proceeds as one by one the unaware adults are picked off one by one.

The movie succeeds in taking the focus off of the lake, introducing new characters, creating some new kills, and introducing the hockey mask.  The movie fails, in a tongue-and-cheek way, of being predictable, breaking the fourth wall, and using cheesey 3D effects (especially if watching 2D).

Amazon HD Streaming Quality:  The streaming quality is in line with the Blu-Ray; however, that is not a compliment and it is not a negative towards Amazon.  Paramount Pictures should be ASHAMED of the fact they have never taken the time to remaster this film, clean up the specs of dirt and imperfections in the print, and release a true 1080p restoration.  This is a dirty print in regular format that is being streamed and it is the same if you get the Blu-Ray*.  I say that Paramount should be ashamed because if you look at the success of the franchise and the millions this franchise has made on such shoestring budgets, the cash is definitely there to do a great restoration.

*NOTE:  Movies prior to 2015, possibly 2014, were filmed in a native horizontal resolution of 2000 lines which basically means they can easily be shown in 1080p (1,080 line) HD format.  The problem is that if you take a regular cut of the film without cleaning it up for proper HD display, it will show age, wear, and tear.  This one does, unfortunately, and that is strictly Paramount's fault!",1427328000,3,2078,4.662087912087912

This is where Jason gets his iconic mask the kills are more unique with more gore factor than the first 2. The story deepens at Camp Crystal and things will never be the same. As part 4 to me was kinda weak & part 5 had a twist. Parts 6-8 he is a zombie(those are great) but this is the end of the oldschool burlap sack transition. You won't be disappointed check it out it is a classic & back then too see in 3-D at a drive-in would be cool but with me the classics live on.",1423872000,3,734,3.772727272727273

257337,5,6300214311,"I was in high school when this came out and got to see it in the theater with the 3D. For those of you who don't know by now, the small recap of part 2 in the beginning was not shot in 3D. This Blu-ray edition is pretty good, but probably not the greatest transfer they could have done. Still, I think it is one of the best of the series. This is the movie you see Jason starting to wear his infamous hockey mask after killing off one of the teens. I also think the ladies in this installment are the hottest, with perhaps an exception of Teri from Part 2. As a sophomore in high school after seeing this movie, I had a big crush on the actress Dana Kimmel. Mmmm I really wanted a gal like that! lol

A group of teens go to Crystal Lake to have fun, but get more than they bargained for when Jason comes to spoil everything once again.
What made me like this one was the death scenes getting more creative plus the ending of Jason getting an axe in his head and then lunging out at Chris' character. Seemed like classic '80s horror right there summed up in one scene. lol

I had always thought that Paramount would eventually do a movie with the survivors of the franchise getting in touch with each other to track down the infamous Jason and dispose of him, once and for all.  Amy Steele from part 2, Dana Kimmel from part 3 (although she seemed to be crazy as the police took her away at the end), Kimberly from part 4, The blonde ""doctor"" from part 5, Tommy, of course from 4,5,6, the telepath from 7, and ""Rennie"" from 8.

Anyway, if you like this franchise, I think you will like this one. Don't look for great dialog here, as we are talking about early '80s horror flicks and they are not known for it. Richard Brooker, along with Kane Hodder perhaps play the best Jason in the series and he doesn't disappoint.  If you are looking for a modern make of 3D like today's 3D movies, well, it's not that. You have to think that this format, although not new, was still in it's infancy for the most part. 3D made somewhat of a comeback in the 1980s but didn't make that much of a splash like today's modern action movies. Still, a great Blu-ray to have in your horror library.
Now, just waiting for the other individual releases 4-8. (By the way, the ""Deluxe Edition"" of the DVD, does not have the features below. Only the Theatrical Trailer.)

257398,3,6300214311,"I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, which started in 1980 with the mega-success of the first film. My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer--who increasingly becomes an infernal monster--just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Jason Voorhees that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.

The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduces a campy element with ""Part III"", which pretty much plagues the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway.

Still, this is the main detriment of ""Part III"", released in 1982. The opening credits song tips the viewer off that this isn't a wholly serious horror film (like the first two), which is compounded when a couple of the protagonists meet some sinister bikers at a convenience store in the boonies, which takes place about 25 minutes into the story. These hoodlums are too cartoony to take serious and so it's hard to take the horror of the story serious as well. This doesn't mean it's not an entertaining installment, just that it's my least favorite.

Another noticeable difference between ""Part III"" and the two previous films is that, although the story takes place in the area of Crystal Lake, the film was shot on the West Coast instead of the East Coast, specifically Santa Clarita, CA, and nearby Melody Ranch (where the barn is located). The geography is obviously dryer, but this won't make much of an impact on most viewers and, besides, it is a nice change of pace from the first two movies.

As usual, the film features a nice assortment of young women - three white girls, a Hispanic and a black woman, the latter being the biker chick, Fox. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the main protagonist, Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, is probably it, followed by the stoner chick, Chili. Debbie and Vera are also on hand.

Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but--with the exception of the 2009 reboot--I don't find these movies particularly scary, although they have loads of jump scares. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary, for me anyway. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Part III"" is another entertaining segment in the series and it's notable for switching the filming locations to dry Southern California, not to mention Jason is bigger and more imposing than in ""Part II"" and he finally acquires his iconic hockey mask, but ""Part III"" is my least favorite of the franchise due to the overt goofy elements.

The film runs 95 minutes.

I have to say that the 3D effects are quite good with the glasses. Now, the only problem were the opening titles. I'm not a technical expert, but the 3D effect was not present as it was in the theater. As I remember watching this in the theater I was really impressed with the title presentation.  You could reach out and ""touch"" the letters as they appeared right in front of you given the 3D. I'm not sure why that effect didn't translate to this Blu-ray and it was somewhat of a disappointment. But overall I still enjoyed this third installment of the franchise. This movie was made during a ""revival"" of 3D movies in the early 1980's, and as such I always thought of the process as more of a gimmick as opposed to the prevalence of 3D movies put out currently. I kind of wish modern movies were mostly released without an eye for specifically 3D effects. I know there is also a 2D version shown simultaneously, but the movies are designed to ""show off"" 3D. My point? Just make a good movie without the 3D and reserve that as a gimmick every so often.",1405641600,4,1177,4.231111111111111

i recently watched friday the 13th part 3 for the upteenth time, and i must say, i liked it better than any other previous viewing. other than the cheesy biker gang who hang out in the country siphoning gas from people's vans, it's a pretty taut entry into this venerable series. as the only duel director, steve miner establishes himself as the friday the 13th macdaddy, adding this to his superior part 2. even as a young teen, i was always unsettled by the presence--and killing--of a pregnant woman, who is also easily the most sexualized character in this movie. not sure what it means, not sure if it is a throwaway, a potential red herring (they won't kill her, will they?) or an honest to god ""look how cold-blooded and serious we are'). friday the 13th part 3 contains some signature kills (handstands, anyone?) and a character reading an issue of fangoria (is this fangos first appearance ever in a movie?). special mention must be made of the character shelly, who is, undoubtedly one of the most annoying characters ever committed to screen (he and jar jar binks need to get in a cage match), a credit to actor larry zerner, who just makes shelly unbearable. his death is a mercy, but before he goes, shelly makes one of filmdom's greatest contributions. friday the 13th part 3 features two major elements unique to the franchise: shelly's iconic contibution (you'll just hafta see it) and a character, dana kimmell, with prior experience meeting jason.  an interesting, entertaining addition to the series.",1393200000,,1540,4.85171102661597

257452,5,6300214311,"I'm not gonna lie, Friday the 13th Part 3 is not only my favorite film of the series, but it's probably my favorite film from the golden age of slasher films.

Exactly one day after the massacre in Friday the 13th Part 2, Chris and her friends decide to spend the weekend at Higgins Haven which sits directly on Crystal Lake. Jason who's perfectly ok after his fight with Ginny the night before, watches the friends from a creepy barn. And it's not until night falls where he finally makes his move. Will anybody survive the night?
Friday the 13th Part 3 is the film where Jason gets his hockey mask for the first time, and in a scene that is clearly the ""I am your father"" moment of the series, Jason makes his entrance with the iconic hockey mask for the first time. The way it done is absolutely perfect. It's almost like they knew this was a special moment, not only in the series, but in pop culture in general. Richard Brooker (RIP) made one heck of a good Jason too. People mention how great Kane Hodder was all the time, but Brooker is right up there with him.
But for me, what really makes this film so good is it's characters. Very rarely in slasher movies are a group of characters as great as they are here. Not only are they a bit more mature than the norm, but they actually seem like a real group of friends. Every single of them is likable in their own way, and you're actually sad when Jason starts to knock them off. Sure you can say Chris is no Ginny, but really it's the supporting cast which makes the film in this one. For example one of my favorite relationships in the film is between Vera and Shelley. I'd even go as far as saying their storyline is somewhat touching! I always liked the scene where Vera looks at the picture in Shelley's wallet. Even after all the times throughout the day he's annoyed her with his jokes, it shows that she does seem to care about him on some level.
Another great relationship in the film is between Andy, and again Shelley. Andy is this real good looking athletic guy, and Shelley is this overweight and mostly misunderstood outcast. Even so, Andy sees Shelley as his best friend (a pairing you'd never see be friends in 99 percent of other slasher movies), and I really like the scene early on where Shelley's like ""would you be yourself if you looked like this?"". Andy gives him a supportive smile, and pat on the back, and it's just a nice moment :). Speaking of Andy , his girlfriend Debbie is the series only pregnant character (something incredibly rare in slasher movies in general), and I liked how later on in the film she changed her mind about having a beer. It's something small, but it showed a lack of stupidity you see in most movies like this. Sure there's a couple of misplaced stoners in here, but they're also likable, and I like that they're in the movie.
Overall it's good to see a slasher movie that wasn't afraid to actually make their characters likeable and caring. It does wonders for the film.
To top it off we get one heck of a good final chase scene that rivals the one from part 2, and some really good special effects/3D sequences.
The movies rated R. The kills are more brutal then they are gory (The MPAA did make them cut this a bit like the others), and the film also has a scene of sexuality, and brief nudity.

Overall Friday the 13th Part 3 is my favorite film from a series that I'm a huge fan of. I know I'm not only one who considers this their personal favorite!
Hopefully one day we'll even get a proper real 3D release without the red and blue glasses.

257489,4,6300214311,"It is not easy to say which one of the F-13 movies is the best. Each of the first four adds a little more to the grim story of Jason Voorhees until they come to their bloody (if temporary) finale in ""The Final Chapter."" I think everyone would agree, however, that despite the gimmick of 3-D, which was enjoying one of its brief revivals of interest back in '82, and despite the ususal undertone of silliness that marks all of these films, that Part III is a damned good slasher movie, and one which will go down in horror-movie history as the ""one where Jason got his mask.""

Part III picks up almost immediately where Part II left off, with a wounded Jason Voorhees resuming his killing spree at a roadside convenience store run by a sadly likeable man and his shrilling hag wife. After this further reduction of the population of Crystal Lake, we are introduced to this movie's batch of victims: a husband-wife pair of stoners, a horny teen couple, an annoying prankster, a snobby-hot girl, a dudely-doorite with a torch for the troubled heroine, and the heroine herself. Via an incident at yet another roadside store, we also meet three Central Casting bikers who are dumb enough to think they will be the film's antagonists, but who merely present additional fodder for Jason's knife. All these unfortunates convene at Higgins' Hideaway, the ususal rustic house set beside the usual rustic barn. There's just one problem. Jason's in the barn!

There obviously is no need to go into the plot. All F-13 films are essentially plot-free, the ""story"" merely being how each individual sucker will die at Jason's hands, and how the heroine (for it is almost always a girl, though sometimes she has male help) will ultimately put the pause button on Jason's crusade to curb teenage sex and marijuana abuse in Crystal Lake. In that regard the film delivers fairly well, beginning with more or less ordinary kills and ramping up to some truly savage acts of violence, not the least of which is one poor slob who gets a machete right through the crown jewels, and another whose head gets crushed like a rotten tomato in a vice.

Now, I am only giving credit where it is due to say that some of these poor people are actually fairly well-drawn, and that the actors all do credible [or better] jobs of conveying their characters' limited personalities. I truly didn't want some of these folks to die, which of course adds to the suspense. What's more, the scene in which Jason finally appears with his newfound hockey mask is not only a piece of horror-movie history, it's also a damned effective piece of visual terrorism. And the movie's climax is just relentless, with the violently active Jason tearing the barn to pieces trying to get at our long-suffering heroine. There are a lot of real jumpy moments in this flick, a couple of nice in-jokes (""Fangoria"" magazine, for example) and the shrieking musical score by Harry Manfredini only adds to the viewer's jangled nerves.

To be sure the film has its problems. All slasher films, and FRIDAY films in particular, depend upon the extreme stupidity of the characters and their complete failure to exercise common sense or even rudimentary brain-function (""Go down to the cellar and check the fuse box."") Also on the audience's willingness to swallow a lot of preposterous occurances, some of which are just plain physically impossible. Part III is no exception. Nearly everyone in the movie is clueless, and their collective failure to notice the hulking murderer with the deformed head constantly walking in and out of a barn 30 feet from their house is cause for dismay. The fact that the Jason had a machete plunged halfway through his torso at the climax of Part II is not in much in evidence here either; since he doesn't become truly supernatural until Part VI, it's hard to explain how that wouldn't effect his performance, or how he survives some of the abuse he takes in this film while trying to put down the heroine. What's more, in regards to the need for greater acts of violence, I was personally offended by the choice of making one of the victims pregnant, and on top of that killing her via a red-hot poker through the belly. The dude in the wheelchair from ""II"" was bad enough, but a pregnant woman impaled on a poker? Come on, man. That's just vulgar.

Having said that, this is my personal fave of all the FRIDAY films. If you can ignore the many gratuitous shots of yo-yos and cigarette butts and popcorn flying at the camera to show off a 3-D effect you can't see, this is definitely the slasher flick for you.",1341532800,4,4577,4.680745341614907

257521,5,6300214311,"Released in 1982 when I was one-year-old, the movie picks up a day after the Camp Crystal Lake killings from the second film. Chris Higgins, along with her pals Shelly, Debbie, Andy, Vera, Chuck and Chili, returns to her family cabin, called Higgins Haven, the first time since she was attacked by a disfigured man two years earlier. Already at the cabin is Chris's boyfriend, Rick (who is way to old for her).

Shelly (the goofball of the group) and Vera run into a group of bikers briefly. The bikers follow them to the cabin, where the bikers attempted to burn down the barn, but Jason is hiding there and he gets rid of them. While Chris and Rick go out for a drive, one by one Jason slaughters her friends Then he slips on the hockey mask for the first time.

I vividly recall watching Friday the 13th part 3 for the first time when I was around eight or nine on a Saturday afternoon. Even though it was heavily cut, I instantly became a fan of the series. Several years ago, around Halloween, my local Walmart had 1 through 8 on DVD for five dollars each. At the time I didn't have the money to buy them, but to my surprise I received the DVDs as a Christmas present from my parents. I take them out and watch them around Friday the 13th or Halloween. The fourth, third, second and sixth movies are my favorites out the series.

Part 3 was originally released in 3D, which wasn't technology developed as it is now. The 3D version was released on DVD a few years ago, but I only have the 2D version. The opening credits suffer from it, and there are a few instances where an object is forced toward the audience. I like most of the characters except for Chuck and Chili, the hippies. They're much older than the rest of the group, and they're just there for a death scene. Just like part 2, the 3rd has a long chase scene between the heroine and Jason, in which at times is intense and inspired some of scenes in the remake. In the end, we get the famous axe to the head scene, which was intended to end the series, but instead we got more sequels.",1337731200,2,2053,4.286082474226804

Friday the 13th Part 3 is a great installment in the ""Friday the 13th"" series. It's well-written, and it has good 3-D gags, like an eyeball popping out at the screen. Plus, Jason finally gets his infamous hockey mask.
  As you can see, this review is missing a star. That has nothing to do with the film, but with the 3-D glasses that come with it. It's the red-and-blue 3-D, not the clear 3-D that the film had when it was playing in theaters. I recommend not watching the WHOLE movie in the 3-D, because the red-and-blue can make your eyes feel weird. Luckily, the DVD's menu gives you the option of watching it in 2-D or 3-D.
  Now, on to the features. You would think that since it is the ""Deluxe Edition,"" it would have some good Special Features. Well, there's only a theatrical trailer. It's a bit disappointing, but still a great DVD.
  Overall, an awesome film. If you haven't seen a ""Friday the 13th yet,"" I recommend this as your first one. It has almost all those classic slasher movie elements, and the characters are enjoyable.",1326672000,2,1111,4.47029702970297

bought the box set which has this version but only in 2-d which looks weird...decided to plop down the money for the version here with the glasses.

got them. movie in great shape. two pairs of glasses. but gotta say its extremely misleading. i have a fairly decent plasma and did everything your supposed to do....low lights, brightness on tv up higher, etc....everything....the 'effect' was awful and no way i could sit through more than ten minutes of it.

257552,3,6300214311,"Friday the 13th: Part 3.  When I first watched this movie it was back in the late 90's when I had just gotten into horror movies and for the most part I found Part 3 forgettable, just another bland entry in the series.  While the first four entries of the Friday the 13th series are all enjoyable slashers, today I would argue that Part 3 is the best of the series for several reasons:

-It had a good body count (12)

-Some great kills (ie: fire poker through the torso, dude cut in half while doing a hand stand and one fellow whose eye literally pops out due to his skull be crushed)

-Jason was still human instead of an invincible rotting creature and there was the chance that he could be killed

-I liked most of the characters in this entry, you got to know them a little before they were butchered

-This was the first film where Jason wears the hockey mask for the first time

-Its In 3D!

*Now a little explanation concerning the 3D version.  Unlike today's movies, this film was shot in an older 3D style which basically amounted to two separate pictures being overlapped with added light that was filter. The 3D works.....with certain shots, mainly ones in which something is being pointed at and reaching towards the camera, otherwise the color palate has weird tinges of red and blue. Watching the movie in 3D isn't horrible, but takes some getting used to and is essentially a novelty.....but still fun to sit in the dark wearing the lame 3D glasses.",1302912000,,1466,4.477443609022556

They didn't put any of the cool extras on here, banking on the 3D effect being the main drive, and the 3D here stinks. Nowadays, with the advancements in 3D, this cardboard crap is just bad. I too was really looking forward to finally seeing this again in 3D, because I saw it in the movies back when, but to see it this way isn't worth it. The opening credits, for some reason are in 2D. The credits popping out are some of the best 3D effects in the movie and they left it in 2D. The entire movie has heavy duty ghosting throughout. 20 minutes in  and you have a major headache. And remember, this disc offers NOTHING except the 3D version of the film. I hear the Blu ray release has ghosting problems as well. Also, the movie is very grainy.

This one is an improvement over the first two films but this movie still fails to be good as it suffers from treading all too familiar territory seeing as nothing new is really going on in this entry. This entry is of particular significance because this is where Jason finally gets his famous hockey mask. There are some cool murder scenes like the one where Jason shoots an arrow straight into a girl's eye knocking her dead into the lake and the scene where Jason stabs a guy while he walks upside down! The acting still hasn't really improved any but this film does have one of the best portrayals of Jason you'll find in this series as Jason seems more human here then in any of the other Friday films before or since.

All the rest of the Deluxe Editions have loads of great extras to fill out the disc. I rented the Blu-Ray just to see what there was. As another reviewer posted in their review, here are the extras exclusive to the Blu-Ray copy:

FRESH CUTS: 3D TERROR - 12:51
Solid feature that explains how the movie came to be plus the original idea before it became the movie we know; the 3D process is also covered and overall this was a solid feature that gives us enough info, but does leave you wanting slightly more, but overall it's a solid feature. Interviews with Peter Bracke, Martin Jay Sadoff, Larry Zerner, Richard Brooker, Sandi Love, Douglas White.

LEGACY OF THE MASK - 9:32
Another strong feature, which explains how Jason got the mask and overall it was a fun feature and it also gets into the mask in the rest of the movies plus Jason's look through out the series; brief, but to the point; interviews with Peter Bracke, Martin Jay Sadoff, Richard Brooker, Douglas White, Larry Zerner.

SLASHER FILMS: GOING FOR THE JUGULAR - 7:06
Another strong feature, which covers quickly what, makes these movies work so well and this might be my favorite feature on the disc even if we've seen numerous documentaries and books on this subject I still always find it entertaining. My only complaint is that it's too brief; Ari Lehman, Stu Charno, Tony Todd, Del Howison, Tony Moran, Harry Manfredini, Richard Brooker, Robbi Morgan and Larry Zerner appear.

LOST TALES FROM CAMP BLOOD- PART 3 - 4:47
This is a short film written and directed by Andrew Ceperley and the first 2 parts can be found on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the first 2 movies; this one can only be seen on the Blu-ray for Part 3. Overall it was good running at under 5-minutes there is only so much that can be done, but I did enjoy this.

THEATRICAL TRAILER - 2:09

Lost Tales from Camp Blood Part 3 was the middle chapter of a fan film that you can't find anywhere else. Watching the Deluxe Edition features, as I always do, I got lost in the middle of the interesting little tale. It's fun to watch. All of these features were great to finally get to watch.

257603,4,6300214311,"If Paramount's A-movie franchise was Star Trek, then their B-movie franchise would definitely be Friday The 13th. A total of eight were made and, with the exception of '83, there was a Friday The 13th for every year in the Eighties, with the TV series debuting in '87.

They were tacky, badly made and infrequently showed any professionalism, or dynamic filmmaking. But they sure had their moments and Part 3 is definitely the best of the first four, Part 5 being the joker in the pack and 6-8 the second instalment of the Jason Voorhees legacy.
Copy picture

Apparently, not getting enough of butchering teenagers with the first sequel, director Steve Miner returns for more unlucky day murders. While his first outing was almost the exact same as the original, only with a different killer, Part 3 reinvents the franchise and totally solidifies Jason as a horror movie icon.

Chris (Dana Kimmel) has had a difficult past few years and she decides to spend a long weekend at Higgins Haven with her friends. Too bad for them that Jason (Richard Brooker) is lurking in the woods. He and Chris have had a scuffle in the past and she's afraid to go out there alone.

Her friends are an unusual bunch. There are a couple of stoners, Shelly, a fat kid who just wants to be loved (Larry Zerner), a pregnant friend (Tracie Savage) and her hunky squeeze (Paul Kratka). These are not the typical goofball sex-mad teenagers of the early Eighties. For some reason, the writers have made them somewhat subdued and realistic. They seriously want a quiet weekend - no partying, no loud music. It helps that we like them, because in most other occasions we can't wait for them to get slaughtered.

And they aren't the only ones in trouble. A non-threatening biker gang plan to cause havoc at Higgins Haven, because Shelly knocked over their scooters, and end up regretting it. If anything, they make for some light comedy - intentional, or not.

Halfway through, Shelly pulls a joke on the girl he fancies. He leaps out of the water wearing a hockey mask and brandishing a harpoon. Five minutes later Jason gets his hands on them. And ever since, the image of the hockey mask has been the trademark of the series.

In every other sequel, Jason is a walking monolith. He'd kick Freddy's ass, show Michael Myers a thing or two about the art of teenage massacre and somehow be able to maintain his cool and make it all seems effortless. This is the only time you will see him for what he really is - a retarded hillbilly. He evens smiles! Twice!!

Miner would return later to the same location in Lake Placid. Here, he successfully portrays Crystal Lake as a tranquil, peaceful place and manages, in the final scenes, to infuse it with atmospheric excitement, all without the use of rain, or lightning.

It wouldn't be hard to make a sequel superior to the original Friday The 13th. Miner failed with Part 2, but excels in Part 3. It has a lighter tone and different feel from the others. In fact, it shouldn't be viewed as a horror film at all. It's an adventure movie, set in the woods, with one of the best villains ever.",1282780800,2,3106,4.602169981916817
257604,4,6300214311,"Paramount continue to offer solid, accurate Blu-ray transfers of this series. Both ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" look excellent and filmic on Blu-ray with appropriate amounts of grain and so on. (Read my reviews for those individual titles.)

""Friday the 13th Part 3"" on Blu-ray (BD) continues the trend of offering up this series in the best quality possible. However, this BD does not get a perfect 5-star rating from me, unlike the previous two releases. Not that the BD itself doesn't transfer the film accurately--it does--but the problem lies within the film's original photography. To achieve the 3D effect, certain filming processes were required. (I couldn't give you the technical know-how on this, however.) What you get is a film that looks rather cheap and corny in 3D, as all 3D films did (and in my opinion still do, even with the advances in technology).

When viewed in 2D, you can clearly tell that the movie was filmed for 3D. The 3D effect is missing, so the perspective is awkward, and the photography looks quite a bit blurred, especially on the sides. Again, this is inherent to the original photography and not the HD transfer itself, so I can't fault the Blu-ray for this.

Taking all that into consideration, the BD looks far more filmic and representative of the original film than any DVD releases. Far better clarity of detail, with excellent grain structure and color reproduction. This is the best this film is ever going to look on home video, as it appears to be an accurate recreation of the original film elements; it is a huge step above the DVDs.

257606,5,6300214311,"Well, I absolutly loved Friday the 13th Part 1 & 2, so I was alittle iffy about a third sequel, I didn't know if it could keep up the good streak of films, but I actually, loved this again!

The film, opens with a recap of the events with part 2, with the head of Betsy Palmer on the table and Amy Steele pretending to be Jasons mom. Now in the real film, the opening titles show a cool 3-D effect with the credits popping out with this cool, funky music playing in the backround.

Well, we open to the film with the teens. But what I found unusual about this one was that instead of Camp Crystal Lake, they go to this little barnyard, because its like a farmhouse, with a barn, which was a cool setting for me though.

One of my favorite actors in this film was actually the comedic relief Larry Zerner. I know this is a really random useless fact, Larry Zerner was on the game show ""1 vs. 100"" and didn't mention Friday the 13th III, but back to the film,  he is the comic relief, playing pranks on everybody. Plus, this guy is also how Jason recieves his hockey mask, because he scares a woman by popping up under the lake wearing it, and then drops it in the barn.

I also love the ending to this movie was sort of a reference to the first film, and literally is a SPOT ON remake of the ending of the first ending, exept with Jason running out of the house without his mask on.

The deluxe edition DVD has a 3D feature, and the movie comes with 3D glasses which are really cool looking. So I highly recommend Friday the 13th: 3, great gore, acting, and a nice storyline, and all likable characters.",1278374400,2,1602,4.168284789644013

My room is dark and the TV is bright so it made it works.  Just thought you guys might like to know this.  I love this movie and 3D sure made it exciting!,1263513600,3,411,3.8333333333333335
257627,4,6300214311,"Nice to finally get this version on DVD. My only complaint, if worth mentioning, the first 10 minutes of the DVD are not processed in 3-D, in the theatrical release, following the Paramount logo and Part 2 ending, The Main Titles were in 3-D, in this DVD they are flat. I'm Lucky to have downloaded the Japanese CED videodisc, as it is completely 3-D. A real plus here is the Harry Manfredini score together with the Hot Ice Part 3 Theme in a 5.1 mix. The packaging comes with a outer cover in 3-D, and the custom designed 3-D glasses are a cool bonus, just like the ones issued at the theater back in 1982.

The main reason why I but this addition aside from the fact that it was used is I figured it would be cool to own this joke of a 3d movie.  I mean an 80's movie in 3d if it would have actually worked that would have been too funny.  All laughing aside and solely rating this as a 2d movie.  The movie was good it was exactly what I figured a friday the 13th movie would be.  Aside from the 1 and 2nd movie this maybe my favorite, granted the acting was poor, but for a B rated movie that's expected.  The movie played the cabin role well, really made the place look like a camp.  Much like the first movie did, if you are going to watch a friday the 13th movie the first three really are the best in my opinion.

257629,2,6300214311,"Part 3 is my second favorite installment of the series behind the Final Chapter. So I'm a big fan of the movie itself but this Blu ray does not do it justice. First off the so-called special features are nothing special at all. There is the usual commentary but NO DELETED SCENES at all! Deleted scenes are what Friday fans have been asking for for years. And again Paramount stiffs the Friday series and its fans! The only worthwhile special feature is the theatrical trailer which can also be seen on youtube for FREE. The other features are nothing but crap. There is a horrible skit called ""Lost Tales from Camp Blood"" which is nothing but a waste of disk space. It is completely unnecessary and useless. There is commentary from some of the original stars the most interesting being RIchard Booker who played Jason in Part 3 and that is somewhat entertaining but not enough to warrant the price of this Blu Ray. The 3D effects fall flat. They send two pairs of 3D glasses which gave me a headache and the effects are not effective at all. The images have a shadowing effect in 3D. If this is the best Paramount can do for Friday Part 3 then that's too bad because this is a very good horror movie full of great atmosphere and suspense. I have a feeling though that Paramount will somehow discover some of those deleted scenes and offer another Blu Ray for sale for another $25-$30 and just keep exploiting the Friday fans.

I have purchased and watched this dvd a few times now and I don't have any problems with headaches or whatever. I did, however, noticed there were some ghosting and alignment issues throughout the film. It was still enjoyable though. I also want to help people who have seen this dvd and share some helpful tips, if I may. Try watching the 3-D version totally in the dark with no lights on at all in the living room or wherever your standard definition TV and/or HDTV is located in your house. Also, please make sure that is no glare on your tv coming from the outside when it's daylight as I found out that the 3-D version works best viewing it in the dark in my living room and when it's dark outside. I know that many people may already know this information, however, I just want to help those who may not know these helpful tips. I also have several other 3-D movies on dvd and I have watched them in the same manner as described above which still works the best for me. I already know that everybody is different and I hope I've helped some people tonight or in the near future as I'm writing this review. I do have one more gripe though about this ""so-called"" deluxe edition of the dvd and as many of you already know, I'm talking about the special features. There's none found on the dvd except the original theatrical trailer. What a rip off that Paramount gave to the public! There are bonus materials found on Friday the 13th Part 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 Deluxe Edition DVDs (I have the first 6 D.E. dvds and waiting for Part 7 and 8 D.E. dvd when it's released on Tuesday, September 15th, 2009). Paramount could have put the bonus features that are found on the Blu-Ray Disc copies of the movie on the DVD copies but didn't and to me that's a rip off. And if you want the bonus features really bad enough, they make you shell out more money for the Blu-Ray version of the movie. Once again, Paramount screwed the fans of this series and the public in general. But what can you do? Well I have said what I wanted to say and I will close this review out as it may bore many people. Thank you for reading my review.

257676,5,6300214311,"After part 2, Jason Voorhees (Richard Booker) is still on the loose as he has gotten some new clothes and murdered a couple of kind store owners. Rich girl Chris (Dana Kimmel) with friends like prankster Shelly (Larry Zerner), Debbie (Tracie Savage), Vera (Catherine Parks), Andy (Jeffery Rogers), Chili (Rachel Howard) and Chuck (David Katims) are off on a sexual holiday at a cottage resort called ""Higgin's Haven"". But unfortunately she had a bad experience there once even involving an encounter with Jason as she will face her fear since he kills her friends.

Very gory and entertaining entry of the very cool Friday The 13th saga! this is the movie that finally introduced audiences to his trademark goalie mask that re-established him. Steve Miner who directed part 2 did a fantastic job on bringing this installment in 3D with humor, shocks, gore, and decent acting making this one of the highest grossing movies of the series at the box-office in 1982, it's a winner.

This blu-ray offers excellent picture and sound with both 3D and 2D versions of the film with 3D glasses and cool extras like slasher film featurette, Lost Tales of Camp Blood part 3 short, legacy of the mask featurette, Fresh-Cuts: 3D terror featurette and trailer.",1250812800,2,1245,4.923809523809524

What I do know is that I was extremely disappointed when I attempted to watch ""Friday the 13th 3-D"" in it's original form on my home DVD player.  I also don't know why they'd even bother releasing such a thing when the results are so awful.  Scratch that.  I do know.  Having fond memories of 3-D films growing up in the 80's I was intensely curious to see how the format would translate to the small screen, and I'd purchased the first two Friday the 13th films based on their classic status and the cool packaging and new special features.  I bought the 3rd on impulse in spite of the extremely conspicuous lack of any special features primarily because I really wanted to see a 3-D film in my home.  And that's how they getcha.  How they got away with calling this a ""Deluxe Edition"" is a mystery.

I remember Part 3 as being my favorite Friday and it's still a solid slasher to be sure.  The ending is still pretty terrifying and my favorite Jason kill ever is in this film.  It's also the very first time Jason Vorhees ever donned his now-iconic hockey mask.  So for Slasher fanatics, this is indeed a landmark film. It's too bad that they skimped on the bonus material in favor of a marketing ploy that did little other then tick me off. I'm also not a fan of padding the running time by opening with the entire climax of the last film.  It eats up running time and that is all it does.  It doesn't even make any sense unless you saw the first two films anyways so why bother?

Anyways, you've got your group of sex-crazed smart-mouthed teenagers, brief shots of gore and brutality, teasing nudity, and of course the echoing ""tch-tch-tch ah-ah-ah-ah"" that I now wish I'd thought to open the video segment with.  Jason fans will enjoy this film as much as ever, but again, don't buy it for the 3-D. I tried watching the film from afar, up close, laying down in front of it, cross-eyed, walking on my hands (not really), and every other way and it just looked like hell any way I tried.  Perhaps a larger screen (which would have to be massive) or blu-ray would help, perhaps not.  But for some reason the 3-D version of this film is not even a little bit watchable in my house. Too bad.  This DVD could have earned another star with some of the cool features like the ""Lost Tales From Camp Blood"" short films featuring bonus Jason kills, or the interviews and convention footage like the previous two Friday re-releases had, but we get nothing but a broken 3-D version.  Screw you too, Paramount.",1250553600,7,3110,4.912045889101338
257678,4,6300214311,".....the 3D sucks. Really. Bad. The MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D Blu-Ray is phenomenal when compared to this junk...but at least you get to see it in 3D the way it was meant. The 3D itself isn't that bad, it's the set-piece killings that fall flat. When a object gets forced into the foreground (3D's purpose!) the split image fails to coalesce properly with these glasses, but the 3D effect in ""normal"" situations is fine. The film was meant to be viewed in polarized fashion, not anaglyph. But MY BLOODY VALENTINE was also shown in polarized 3D and given the anaglyph treatment on DVD with no problems, so who knows..?

Ok, rant over. The film rates a 4/5 stars in the Friday the 13th canon. The first four films are  the best, IMHO. The 2D version in Blu-Ray is probably the best we will ever get. I have compared every edition on DVD ever made for the US market through my 1080p HD projector onto a 100"" screen (I know, I'm lucky!) and the Blu-Ray is tops. I would also like to point out that it seems the exact same print was used to make every DVD. All the artifacts, dust, hairs in the camera gate, etc. are exactly the same in every version. So, again, this is probably the best we can expect, sans some kind of digital clean up, which I'd be against. Although, as noted in other reviews, the ""upgrade"" to the Blu-Ray from the Deluxe Edition is a matter of personal choice, my advice: If you plan on watching the film on a screen over 40"", then you might as well spend the extra $6 for the Blu-Ray.

Extras are nice, but not mind blowing and certainly nothing new is covered for the die-hard fan....I'd rate the extras 3/5 stars.

Overall, this is a welcome edition to my library. You may want to wait as the Blu-Ray will eventually fall in price, maybe even to the $12-$15 range by around November, as usual for these horror releases.

This Blu-Ray DVD is probably the best quality they can muster from the print, so I say 'job well done'. 4/5 stars. Recommended purchase.",1248134400,,1975,4.414835164835165
257679,1,6300214311,"After seeing the imperfect, but decent 3-D treatment that My Bloody Valentine 3-D got on Blu-ray, I excitedly picked up Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3-D.  I was in my teens when this series was being made, and I relished the idea of seeing it again in 3-D.

What a disappointment!  Prior reviews mention a ""ghosting problem,"" but that's putting it lightly.  The ghosting problems are terrible and pervasive.  The ghosting is so bad in some scenes that it gave me a headache.  Daytime scenes are the worst -- sometimes the backgrounds are muddled blue-and-red chaos.  More headaches.

Things that are supposed to ""pop out"" of the screen DO NOT.  At all.  The images ghost into chaos before that ever happens.  So, if you were looking forward to seeing Jason fire a speargun at you, don't get your hopes up.  It doesn't work.

Do not waste you money on this unless you're interested in the 2D copy on the disc.  The 2D version is nicely cleaned up.  Sad the extras on the disc are also pretty weak.",1247788800,2,993,4.5

The home version is limited to the size of your tv screen, the smaller viewing area and glasses provided.  You get what you pay for.  The 3D effect is stronger in some scenes more than others.  This is a classic horror movie and the 3D does make it a different kind of viewing experience.  Occasionally a stick like object appears to be in your living space but the bulk of the 3D effect is the image on your screen.  The effect is like looking out of a bubble window at a world on the other side.  It adds to the creepy nature of the movie.  You don't normally get this kind of viewing experience watching tv, digital or HD.  That's what makes it special.",1247529600,2,730,4.262773722627737
257681,3,6300214311,"1982 saw the release of the third Friday the 13th movie, which was presented in 3D. The DVD now comes with a pair of 3D glasses, but I watched the standard version...I just don't really care. None of the ""Friday"" films can be called masterpieces and part 3 isn't much different from it's predecessors, but it's the weakest of the first three films as a result of low-quality acting, dialogue, and story.

The first seven minutes serve as a recap of the last film and then we meet characters who we all know will be quickly dispatched by Jason so we can meet all the main characters. Returning director Steve Miner piles on the cheap scares leading up to Jason's first kill.

Next we meet a large number of college kids heading out to a cabin in the woods for a weekend stay. Of course, Jason is already awaiting their arrival.

No further description of the plot is needed; you all know what happens next. Part 3, as I said, does not differ much from the previous entries...22 minutes into the film we get the stereotypical old man character that warns the kids about the doom that awaits them.

There are more problems with it. All of the actors are inexperienced and that's obvious. No one gave an Oscar-caliber performance in the other films either, but here...The actors seem shy and awkward. The dialogue and the delivery of it is atrocious. As if that's not bad enough, the movie has two stoner characters that are completely out of place. They both look about 10 years older than the others and their presence makes no sense.

This, however, is the installment where Jason (played by Richard Brooker this time around) got his iconic hockey mask. Good thing too as Jason looks more funny than frightening without it.

Most of my complaints about the movie are common for a slasher film. The whole concept of a slasher film is for a group of people to be systematically killed in interesting ways by some maniac, so why does dialogue and acting matter? Well, really, it doesn't. But I just don't see any of the actors, writers, or director having much passion for this project. It seems like they all just wanted to get it over with. It is that factor that makes this the weakest ""Friday"" up to this point.

Luckily, ""Friday the 13th: Part Three"" does have it's moments of suspense and, for all it's faults, is entertaining. It's not a complete pile of garbage, but there's nothing impressive here.

257682,4,6300214311,"I purchased this movie with little expectations.  I have always enjoyed this series regardless of the content.  It has always been a guilty pleasure for me.  Having first viewed this movie a decade ago I was unaware that it had been released in 3D.  Due to the small price difference between the Bluray and DVD I went with Bluray.

In the end I am very pleased.  This movie is pure fun.  It has its flaws and goes blurry frequently however there is something nostalgic about wearing a set of 3D glasses watching a cheesy movie.

I'll admit, it took me a bit to get into the movie.  I kept focusing on the flaws in the film at first.  It took me a good ten-minutes to get engrossed however once I had, I really enjoyed the film in 3D.  It was fun to watch some of the effects and definitely gave a different feel to the movie.

It is not something I will do always.  It is a bit cumbersome to wear the glasses and I found it annoying when any source of lighting was in the area of the television.  I recommend watching it in the dark.  This is when it looked best to me.

For anyone considering this movie, there probably is little difference between the Bluray copy and DVD.  The film is grainy however the sound is pretty good.  I purchased the Bluray because it was only $5.00 more and would do it again.

In the end.  It is a fun movie.  It is far from perfect however I am glad I made this purchase and got to see the film in 3D....the way it was intended.",1246838400,3,1460,4.161290322580645
257693,5,6300214311,"This is for the Delux 3-D version. I have the original DVD release so I'm writing for those who have the original AND those who don't. Also for those who never saw the movie.

First off, the 3D is killer! I've heard some complain about it and saying 3-D doesn't work on DVD. Maybe I read those complaints on the ""My Bloody Valentine 3-D"" DVD, but still, my dvd player is old and the 3-d is so good that even on regular dvds things stand out. The 3-D works well, if it doesn't then it is your dvd player.

The images are crisp and clear and much better than the original dvd release. As with The Final Chapter, the picture quality alone is worth double dipping if you already have the original dvd. Also you have the option to view the movie in 2-D (regular) or 3-D. You get two 3-D glasses with Friday The 13th on them. Not much in the way of extras here, but it does have the theatrical trailer.

For me, this is one of the better Friday The 13th's (my 2nd favorite to part 4 ""The Final Chapter""). It's the one where Jason first gets the hockey mask. It's also one of the spookier films in the series. At times the movie is silly with some of the 3-D stuff and a little dated (nothing beats 80's gangs for sillyness). This was back when Jason was a bit more inventive with his killings. The film also follows one of the better aspect of late 70's and early 80's horror flicks in that the people are isolated (like Halloween, Halloween 2, The Thing etc). Basically they are at a house & barn. No real running through woods type stuff here.

There are plenty of spooky moments. I rate this my 2nd fav Friday The 13th (including the remake & Freddy vs Jason which are 3rd and 4th in Friday movies for me.)If you like movies that scare this one is for you. If you already have the older dvd release and don't even care about the 3-D you would like this DVD because of how good this DVD restores the movie.

***  Out of 5

For years the Friday the 13th movies were kicked aside by Paramount pictures with lame release after another. The original DVD releases had no features at all except for the theatrical trailer, which I personally don't consider to be a feature, but the 7th and 8th installments didn't even get that. Finally after the success of Freddy Vs Jason Paramount put out a set Crystal Lake to Manhattan, which featured the first 8 movies and while at least we finally got something it wasn't much to brag about and it was good overall, but the set was clearly rushed and really was about average at best as a whole.

With the release of Friday the 13th 09, Paramount finally gave the fans what they have wanted for years and that was SE releases. February 09 saw the release of the original uncut for the first time in the States released on Blu-ray and DVD and part 2 and 3 also got Deluxe Edition DVD releases.

Fans have wanted part 3 released in 3D and we finally got it. Despite being called a Deluxe Edition since it was anything but that, there were no features at all on the disc, but seeing as it was released in 3D it was easy to get over. There were problems with the DVD release with ghosting and double images and fan reaction was mixed. Now on June 16th, 2009 Friday the 13th Part 3 makes its debut on Blu-ray (along with Part 2) and unlike the DVD it has a nice batch of features, which is unfair to those who don't own Blu-ray players. I was 3-years old when this movie was first released so I have only been able to see the movie in 2D; I like this movie a lot and while it's not a very good movie per se it achieves what it sets out to do, but knowing it was originally in 3D it did kind of suck only being able to view it in 2D even if still enjoyable it was disappointing.

So here we are with the Blu-ray release and the question is simple; is it worth the upgrade? Well that's what I'll cover as I review the disc.

FRESH CUTS: 3D TERROR (HD)- 12:51
Solid feature that explains how the movie came to be plus the original idea before it became the movie we know; the 3D process is also covered and overall this was a solid feature that gives us enough info, but does leave you wanting slightly more, but overall it's a solid feature. Interviews with Peter Bracke, Martin Jay Sadoff, Larry Zerner, Richard Brooker, Sandi Love, Douglas White.

LEGACY OF THE MASK (HD)- 9:32
Another strong feature, which explains how Jason got the mask and overall it was a fun feature and it also gets into the mask in the rest of the movies plus Jason's look through out the series; brief, but to the point; interviews with Peter Bracke, Martin Jay Sadoff, Richard Brooker, Douglas White, Larry Zerner.

SLASHER FILMS: GOING FOR THE JUGULAR (HD)- 7:06
Another strong feature, which covers quickly what, makes these movies work so well and this might be my favorite feature on the disc even if we've seen numerous documentaries and books on this subject I still always find it entertaining. My only complaint is that it's too brief; Ari Lehman, Stu Charno, Tony Todd, Del Howison, Tony Moran, Harry Manfredini, Richard Brooker, Robbi Morgan and Larry Zerner appear.

LOST TALES FROM CAMP BLOOD- PART 3 (HD)- 4:47
This is a short film written and directed by Andrew Ceperley and the first 2 parts can be found on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the first 2 movies; this one can only be seen on the Blu-ray for Part 3. Overall it was good running at under 5-minutes there is only so much that can be done, but I did enjoy this.

THEATRICAL TRAILER (HD)- 2:09
No need to explain this.

2D VERSION
Not every movie benefits from HD and this one is sort of one of those movies; the transfer while I suppose it an upgrade over the standard DVD, but I'm not really sure though. The transfer for the Blu-ray isn't really that good to be honest. After seeing the transfer for the original Friday the 13th I really got excited for this release, but there is no comparing the two at all. This one falls a bit flat in a lot of spots. The picture is a bit flat and there is noticeable grain in many scenes, and even in the standard version you can see spots of dirt on the screen, which I suppose is on the actual cameras and in HD you can see that even more; if one didn't know any better you might think it's on your TV set. Comparing the standard DVD to the Blu-ray the dirt is a bit more noticeable here and actually it can be a slight distraction at times; of all the Blu-ray's I own of flicks of a certain age this is by far the worst transfer; I heard the Deluxe Edition DVD also looked weak and in no way does this really improve. Like I said I don't think this really improves on the original DVD release. If I'm being totally honest here I think I might prefer the original standard release.

That's not to say it's a total bust there are some moments where it looks good, but overall there is too much dirt and grain to really be worthy of being called an upgrade. Some scenes the grain is cleaned up compared to the original release, but there is still enough grain and blemishes on this transfer that in my opinion keep it from really being called an upgrade.

Some scenes do stand out compared to the original DVD and look good, but never great. But there is just too much dirt and grain for this to be anything besides an ok transfer. The colors are sharp for the most part, but something just doesn't fully work here; at times the picture looks a little washed out. Again the Blu-ray in my opinion hardly looks better than the original standard DVD. In the area it might improve the look it also takes away due to the dirt. If this version is an upgrade I'd say its barley though.

3D VERSION
The Deluxe Edition had a lot of problems with ghosting and double images and that is also a problem here as well. All the 3D scenes have a bit of ghosting or double images and there is a lot more grain to be found here unlike the 2D version, which again does suffer from that, but despite that the 3D does work well mostly. No doubt these problems are annoying and do slightly take away from the movie. Obviously this won't compare to the original theatrical release and I don't think it's anywhere near as good as the Blu-ray release of My Bloody Valentine, which worked surprisingly well; but again the 3D works well despite all the scenes having ghosting or double images. A couple of scenes do lose a little bit due to that, but while most are slightly annoying it doesn't take away from the movie and finally seeing Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3D adds a whole new layer to the movie and really adds to the entertainment. The stuff that works best are tree branches or leaves, dirt being blown by the wind and bugs flying around; Those are the things that play out the best, which is cool, but not really what we all want to look best.

Nothing here for the most part works great; some 3D looks cool other times not so much. The strengths are the hobo in the beginning with the eyeball despite the ghosting and or double image it looks cool the bikers that are killed in the barn also works really well and I think some of those scenes were the strongest despite the problems mentioned. Some stuff however falls flat for instance like the sphere gun scene, which is something I bet most people really want to see; and when you do see it you'll be letdown as it doesn't work that well; when Rick's eyeball pops up out it works fairly decent. The biggest 3D gags are the ones that seem to fall short.

The one scene that worked really great was after Jason gets hit in the head with an axe and he puts his arms out in front of him. Sure we have the same problems of ghosting or double images, but even that cannot take away from the scene as it actually plays out really cool problems and all. That scene really got me going since it was so cool again despite the problems. The handle of the Axe also works well for the most part and I'd say these scenes are probably the best along with the barn scenes.

So like I said the 3D doesn't work great and some really fall flat, but most work; remember though it never works great, but good enough for the viewer to not only have fun, but probably watch the 3D version all the time instead of the 2D. The 3D version does add a new layer to the movie and quite honestly makes the movie a little more fun and makes it feel a little new as well since most of us are seeing it in 3D for the first time.

Some reviews I've seen make the Blu-ray sound like perfection and some have compared it to the theatrical version. I never say this about other people's reviews, but I honestly think those reviews are by people paid by the studio or they are just seeing what they wanna see; despite what some say there is indeed ghosting and double images just like the DVD version, but regardless of those problems again annoying, yes, but still a lot of fun. As stated earlier there is a bit more grain on the 3D version, but even with the grain, ghosting and double images it cannot ruin the fun of seeing this movie in 3D. Don't go into this expecting perfection; just keep in mind the flaws I explained and you should be fine. Not every 3D scenes works and the ones that do don't work great and the ghosting and double images are annoying, but shouldn't ruin the experience of the film.

AUDIO
We have two options the first; Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Dolby Digital Mono. The sound is good, but nothing special. It never really enhances the movie at all. I hoped it would pick up sounds in the background, but it never really does that. The TrueHD 5.1 is solid in terms of the music; the score plays out great and loud and the shrieks in the music might make you jump once or twice where as the dialogue sounds good, but I felt it was a little low. You can hear everything the characters say, but I found it a little lifeless. I actually watched the movie with the original Mono track, which I felt as a whole sounded better, the score might have a little bit more of a jolt to it with the TrueHD, but overall I found the mono track to be the better of the two.

FINAL WORDS ON THE DISC
I had two TVs I tried this on; one set the 3D looked ok it pops out, but nothing really stands out. I than tried it on a plasma TV and it worked far better there. So I think it will all depend on the TV you have. Some sets the 3D may not work that well where as other TV sets it will look a lot better. The extra features while brief are enjoyable and this may not be the ultimate release, but it is a solid one. The flaws with the picture can be forgiven, but the 2D version does fall a bit flat and the ghosting and double images on the 3D can be slightly annoying, but the sheer fun of seeing it in 3D will help you get over it. Bottom line is Friday the 13th Part 3 on Blu-ray doesn't make for the perfect Hi-Def experience, but it gets the job done. If you have the Deluxe Edition the only reason to buy this is for the extras.",1245283200,61,10988,4.235322195704057
257698,1,6300214311,"[...].  Part Five gets points for being a guilty pleasure, though--so bad it's kind of good sort of thing.  This film is basically a cobbled together mess of half hearted atttempts at being scary.  Hell, they even threw in the 3-D gimmick to cover up their lame movie's shortcomings.  Unfortunately, in the home video arena you don't even get the satisfaction of the gimmick, but more on that later....

Firstly, the acting is all uniformly atrocious, especially the actress who plays the film's last girl.  She has an infamous scene where she describes an encounter she had with Jason, and her performance, the editing, the dialogue is so bad that it ends up being hysterical, so I give it points for being so bad that it's good. Plus, as far as the plot, and use the word 'plot' very loosely for a lack of a better word, is utterly pointless and adds nothing to the movie or the overall Jason mythology, if anything it further muddles the notorious Friday The 13th poor continuity. Funnily enough, Jason Takes Manhattan makes a similar mistake, but at least it was filmed and written in a competent manner.  The character of Shelly has to be the most annoying character to ever appear in any slasher film.  Though, he does get some of the best bad dialogue in the film. ""I just want you to like me.""  LOL!  I thought Jason was the only retard in the movie.  The other actors are just forgettable and leave nothing beyond the manner that they are dispatched worth remembering.

Speaking of memorable deaths, the make-up effects in this film are also pretty weak, not as weak as part 5, but pretty close.  I will give kudos to Stan Winston's company's design, specifically the great Kenny Myers, on Jason's visage.  It's creepy, fairly realistic, and fierce.  Why Jason went from a long haired, long faced hill-billy with a Picasso face to a fat, bald brown guy is anybody's guess.  I mean, these films were barely made within a year of each other, why was continuity such a hardship?  I 'eye ball' scene is pretty neat, but that's about it as far as the creative onscreen carnage goes.

This movie almost validated the moral police anti-slasher critics.  What was the point of the whole biker gang?  Oh,  yeah, just more bodies to pointlessly and unscarily get killed by Jason.  It is funny when the should be dead black biker shows up at the climax only to have his hand lobbed off.  Real original stuff going on here.  What a surprise too.  It's almost like a bad super hero film where they keep adding new super heroes to take place of an orignal plot or a plot at all.  Plus, the film is just dull, TOTALLY DULL.  It's actually sleep inducing and that's real death in a horror film!

The only thing this film contributes to the series is it's the first time Jason dons his hockey mask.  Which is funny that the hockey mask has become so iconic, because it's such a silly idea for the mother of all slashers to be walking around with it on.  Michael Myers' maks was scary, even Scream's ghost face killer mask is scarier then a hockey mask.  I would've personally stuck it out with the Elephant Man sack.  Can't do much about it though, it's part of the pop culture horror zeitgeist for all time now. Though, without the hockey mask I wouldn't have got the huge belly laugh out of the remake.  The scene where Jason discovers the hockey mask, again, and the score rises to overwrought levels of absurdity was laugh out loud funny.

Aw, crap even the third act chase is so poorly edited and performed it's sleep inducing!  This movie just plain [..].  Thankfully part 4 came along and put the series back together.

All the Friday movies have been re-released with new special features this year and this is the only black sheep in the bunch.  It's bare bones with the exception of a trailer and  the useless 3-D effect that just doesn't hold up on home video.  Though, the transfer and sound is a huge improvement over the previous From Crystal Lake To Manhattan box set.  Though, that set had a 15 minute retro doc with some of the cast and Sean S. Cunnigham on the Killer Extras disc.  Plus, it also had a cast commentary track over the film, so you might want to hang on to those if you are a die hard fan of this film.

Like the Friday Part 2 Deluxe Edition, and all previous editions, director Steve Miner is nowhere to be found.  He doesn't even look back on this series in print.  He was the only person to direct two of them and he was involved in the making of the original.  Is he ashamed of his involvement?

Unfortunately for them, Jason survived his encounter with Ginny from the last film. He winds up at a store where he kills a married couple and gets a change of clothes. Higgins Haven just happens to be close by. Chris has more than one reason for going on this trip though. She was attacked a few years ago by a hideously disfigured man and is facing her fears in hopes of moving past it. Could this mysterious man and Jason have something in common?

This is the film that introduced us to the hockey mask and was originally in 3-D. It's a shame that's all it really offers though. Watching the 3-D version now will just leave you with a horrible headache. I actually prefer the film in 2-D. The nudity in the film is also rather light and before you jump on me for saying that, that's one of the main things you look forward to in a Friday the 13th film; Jason Voorhees, inventive kills, T&A, and maybe a few laughs. That's what makes the Friday the 13th films fun. Especially compared to the first two films, sideboob and a brief glimpse in the shower doesn't really cut it. I guess what really ruined it for me was the homages to the first film. By the way, what was up with the ending? And why does Mrs. Voorhees suddenly have her head again? It wasn't a bad idea to do a few throwbacks to the original, but it felt like too much by the end of the film.

Chris is the lead girl who has a dark past and a previous encounter with Jason. Shelly is the overweight nerd who keeps pulling childish pranks in hopes to impress his date, Vera. Shelly accidentally has a run-in with a biker gang, who will soon face Jason's wrath. Some of the kills were pretty cool, but some are pretty corny because it was filmed in 3D.

This installment marks the first film with Jason getting his trademark hockey mask. This film is gorier than the first two films and has a slicker look. The 3-D effect is more of a distraction than anything else, but the film is better than the second and more intense than the first.

But even worse is this unique 3-D transfer to normal home video usage. The glasses are cheap looking, which they are indeed, maybe you really need a top notch beamer with a great wall to make this 3-D effect work, but on a smaller screen it just does not look like 3-D, no worse, it gives you a headache and it takes some time to adjust to the lousy effects. Of course Producers have given this typical slasher flick a new twist. Maybe it work in the cinema, but at home you must have some equipment to make this work.

I read the other reviews and wasn't worried, now I am, as I would like to get rid of this stinking-picture.

257738,3,6300214311,"Friday the 13th Part 3 is the best of the first 3, in my opinion. This is not because of the 3D effects, it is that there are more enjoyable characters and more murders to watch. I was lucky enough to see this in 3D at the cinemas back in 1983, and these effects added value to an already good sequel.

There are many reviews here stating how bad the 3D is which has been presented on the new deluxe DVD. In a nutshell, it is. There are odd moments of acceptability, but essentially it is dismal. This could be because the 3D technology used way back in 1982 does not work well on today's viewing monitors. I watched it on a 40"" LCD TV, maybe LCD is what stuffs it up. The red/blue glasses don't help the experience either. They make your eyes feel weird and you can suffer headaches as a result. However, these type of glasses are necessary to view 3D films of that era. Simply put, you can't use modern 3D glasses (i.e. black lenses) to watch old time 3D movies.

As others have pointed out, when objects come out of the screen in Friday the 13th Part 3, as part of the 3D effect, it just looks terrible. It blurs and the effect is lost. It may be worth trying to watch the DVD on your computer or a smaller screen to see if it resolves it. Also, the red/blue glasses give the overall picture a tint which makes the film unrealistic.

I'm not sure if you can blame Paramount for any of the issues with this 3D movie being transferred to DVD.  As I said, there are the odd few scenes where the 3D effect works well, but overall it is no fun to watch. I understand Paramount have been hassled for years to release the 3D version on DVD but declined - possibly for all the problems I have listed above. That is probably why the original DVD of this movie came with the 2D version.

So is it worth buying this DVD? Well, the disc does come with the 2D version which is nicely cleaned up. BUT, the remixed 5.1 sound is nothing to rave about, and most of the noise still comes out of the one speaker (like the original DVD). There are no special features except for a trailer and two sets of 3D glasses.

Save your money, and stick with your original DVD. You've been warned!",1237680000,4,2171,4.194244604316546

There's not much to say about the plot as it's almost identical to parts 1 and 2, although a small gang of bikers follow the teens to camp (but, of course, Jason is around so they don't last long...)

I thought that the chase scene at the end between Jason and The Last Girl was suspencefull and very well done.

257740,3,6300214311,"If you are familiar with 3D for TV, then you probably know that anaglyph (glasses with colored lenses-either red/blue or red/green) rarely measures up to the alternative HQFS (High Quality Field-Sequential) LCD shutter glasses format. This still holds true for this release, but the anaglyph is much better than I expected it to be.

I have not watched this movie from start to finish yet, but have sampled scenes from each chapter. Overall, I was very happy with the results.  Convergence seemed good, with a few exceptions in some scenes.  Color-accuracy was acceptable given that the colored lenses of analglyph glasses will always prevent true color purity.

One thing that I was upset about, however, is that the opening credits were not in 3D!  I realize that the first scene in the movie cannot be in 3D since it is a flashback scene from another movie, but there is no reason to leave the credits in 2D! A big shortcoming, in my opinion.

This movie, and the much better quality anaglyph release of Journey to the Center of the Earth (especially the blu ray version), have restored my confidence in analglygh 3D, which prior to these releases, I was about to give up on.

257741,3,6300214311,"I remember seeing this film in theaters back in '82. This was the height of the ""Friday the 13th"" craze and 3-D was making a comeback. The re-release of the '53 classic ""House of Wax"" with Vincent Price and ""Comin' at Ya"", helped spark some reinterest in this forgotten format. Soon, Chicagoland TV viewers would get ""Revenge of the Creature"" in 3-D on local horror show ""Son of Svengoolie"" (A Historic TV event, even if it didn't look all that 3-D ish!)and ""Jaws 3-D"" and ""Amityville 3-D"" would soon follow in theaters all over the country. Friday the 13th part 3, boast the first film that Jason sports his famous hockey mask, taken from a victim. The killings are typical, the characters are what you would expect from a slasher film, dumb, curious to a fault and just in the wrong place at the wrong time. All that aside, this film is a ""cut"" above the rest, well done, creepy and fun. If you take these films for what they are, 80's slasher flicks, and you're in the right frame of mind (not sure what that is), you will enjoy this film.

Not too much in the extras dept, just the theatrical trailer, (They could have put in a few more trailers for the other films).

For the most part the 3D works really good, especially when there is some solid reference items in the foreground. Adds great depth to the scene. The only time the image splits into two really obviously is when things come hurtling out of the screen and even then, not every time. There is some stunning 3D parts with leaves blowing around in the storm. Occasionally for no apparent reason thing with blur into a double image in the background but this soon rights itself. When its at its best the images look pristine so I was expecting the 2D version to be absolutely stunning. I was dissappointed to find it was quite grainy. I would recommend watching the 3D version in 3 half hour increments as it can give you a headache wathcing for too long.

  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the 3D ""popped"" considering some of the negative reviews.  Some of the obvious sight gags are a bit marred by a doubling effect, however the 3D seems most effective in more mundane scenes, when the actors are simply standing around or sitting.  One scene that sticks in my mind is when two of the actresses are walking through a field, and it looks as though the tall grass is right in your living room.  The two most famous ""pop out at you"" scenes, the speargun and the headcrush, work quite well.  The 3D effect wanes towards the end of the film, taking place at night time.  Apparently the 3D effect works best when filmed in bright lighting.
  As for the film, younger teenagers and children will probably find it very scary and really enjoy the 3D effects, even though they shouldn't be watching an R rated film, right?

If i buy a Blue Ray now. Something far better will be here in about 5 years.

Second. The 3-D works fine, on a computer, TV, whatever. This is really surprising since its in the Red/Blue stereo-vision format. The original was done using the gray lensed glasses that were polarized. So the had to adapt it to this format. A digital 3-D version, with the flickering shutter glasses was released in Japan.
This version has one drawback The opening credits aren't in 3-D, and they most definitely were in the
original release, and they are on the Japan disc release. Also, the first few minutes, stock sequence from
Part 2 does not have the 3D process. In the original version it had a double image that created a sort of
""phoney"" 3D effect. Though not in the full ""POP out at you"" 3D process. It did have a sense of depth to it
and the new inserted shot of Jason pulling the machete out of his arm was in full 3D. Its all flat here.
I don't mind the scenes from part 2 being 2D, but the opening credits being in 2D is inexcusable!!!
Even if youve never seen this movie before, you can tell that the opening credits are supposed to leap out at you.",1235347200,4,1469,4.261648745519714
257779,5,6300214311,"I've been waiting for this to come out in 3-D for a long, long time. I never understood the hold-up in transferring it to DVD with the 3-D effects in the film, wasn't it just a simple film transfer? Turns out it was much more than that. Anway, here we are!!

--The 3-D Aspect--
There are many people complaining about the 3-D aspects of the movie. Personally I didn't have much problem with them at all. Being that they were the old fashioned red-blue kind (and I didn't have to spend extra for a special pair of glasses or some kind of unique device to watch it on), it DOES take some time to adjust your eyes. But once you do it's really amazing! Its what I remember 3-D to be like. I haven't seen anything recently in 3-D (be it Imax or some other theatrical form), so I'm not sure what people were expecting with this release. It is what it is. It's probably not the best thing out there, but people asked for it and now we got it. Considering the wait, I'm very pleased with the results.

--The Movie--
This is my favorite Jason movie out there! It's the one where he gets his mask, and seeing him march out on set with it on really fills you with that feeling of ""here we go!"" and then things really start to happen. The characters are what you expect from a Friday movie, similar to those in the other 3 movies. We have the camp, a lake, JasonThe kills are probably the best & most creative in the series, especially with the added 3-D effects. I love Richard Brooker's take on how he plays Jason, which is similar to the one we're all used to. To me, he defined how Jason moves (a concept redefined by Kane Hodder) and isn't just a zombie stumbling around with a knife. Jason is precise, he knows what he wants, he does what he wants, and no one can stop him.

--Side Notes--
-This movie takes place immediately after the events of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Part-2/dp/B001K9OXE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Part 2</a>, yet his look is completely different. Guess we just have to believe it's the same character.
-The character of Shelly (the prankster where Jason gets his mask) could be compared to an early version of Jason. Jason was an outcast, made fun of by other members of his camp. And Shelly takes on that role in this movie; though no one really picks on him, he is rejected by the other members for his antics of trying to get people to like him. It seems fitting, then, that Jason takes his mask and fools another into thinking he is really Shelly.

Bottom line this is a great movie and one I've been wanting to review for a while. I can only say that you'll be taking your chances with the 3-D aspect(it worked fine for me); there are no other extra features. Not a bid deal. Just seeing it for the first time in 3-D is good enough.",1235260800,7,2803,4.46875
257780,4,6300214311,"I don't know why I am surprised... I really don't. After years of seeing region 4 always get shafted in terms of special features on DVDs I should have seen this coming.

I waited for the new dvd of part 3 to come out locally, I had even contacted a friend who works for the distributors in New Zealand who told me it had all the special features. So I went to the store and grabbed a copy from the shelf, noticing one thing missing from the cover (which is different from the US version). The following is a rough transcript of my phone conversation with my friend.

Me - Hi, I'm at the store about to pick up Part 3 on dvd, but is this film in 3D? It doesn't say so on cover.
Friend - No it's not. But we have all the other features though.
Me - WHAT? You're telling me that after years of people waiting for this film to be released in it's original format you have decided NOT to have it in 3D? You do realise that just makes it a film where all the actors self concoiusly point poles and other object at the camera for no apparent reason... and I already have that on my old copy!
Friend - Yes, but we DO have the other features, like the...
Me - NO! As much as I like things like audio commentaries and behind the scenes stuff you do not seem to understand that doing a special edition of Part 3 and making the decision to not have it in 3D is like selling a car with no engine and trying to say that you're making up for it by having nice hubcaps!

257781,2,6300214311,"First off..I want to make it clear. I'm am NOT basing my review on the film itself. Personally, I love this movie, its one of my top two favorites in the whole Friday the 13th series,, so there's no way I would rate this movie this low. This review is simply based on the 3-D aspect of the film, which I must say..is pretty disappointing. First off, the generic Red & Blue 3-D glasses always give me headaches when I watch 3-D movies with them, but if the effects are good, its usually well worth it. Unfortunately, I was pretty much just left with the headache after viewing this one. The only thing that kept it interesting was the fact that the movie is great, and I just stayed focused on watching it, and for the most part, had to ignore the 3-D! In a nutshell..they're just wasn't much ""3-D"" in this 3-D movie. Most of the gimmicks just didn't work..I kept just seeing double a lot on the screen, rather than images actually standing out. They were a couple of kinda cool moments here and there (Harold putting the stick back on the clothesline, the yo yo gimmick was alright, and the pitchfork through the throat of Fox), but other than that, the 3-D was just more of an annoyance rather than a bonus. Also, I was really disappointed that there were no other special features on the DVD. I recently repurchased the Deluxe Editions of Parts 1 and 2 simply because of the special features (and a pretty cool sliding case!), but I was surprised that there wasn't any added features to this one, except the 3-D feature. This just clearly shows another attempt at the movie companies to sucker fans into buying the film yet again. And I guess its working, cause I bought it! The non 3-D version of the film is also included, so you don't need to glasses to watch the movie, and if you don't own this movie, then this is a decent buy..at least you'll have the ""deluxe"" 3-D version, but unless you're a die hard horror fan like myself, there no real reason to buy this if you already have it. Believe me, the 3-D just isn't worth it! I'm giving this 2 stars simply because of my love for this film, the fact that the non 3-D version of the film is on the disc, and the sliding case is kinda cool! But shame on Paramount for not adding anything else new to the film, and yet calling it a ""Deluxe Edition""..one special feature (and a poorly executed one, at that) doesn't make it deluxe by any means.",1235088000,2,2398,4.354910714285714

The opening credits are shown in 3D but the old stock from part II is in 2D.  This movie is much better in 3D than 2D as much of the film is focused on the visuals that can only be seen with the red/blue glasses.  The only reason why I rate this a 1 star is that people tend to read the low reviews and make their decision, all of which say the 3D doesn't work.  It does but if you sit too close or have a sight problem, like color blind or such it won't work correctly.

More dumb teenagers go to Camp Crystal Lake and Jason hacks them all off one by one. There is no one to root for but Jason. Characters are goofy or just dumb. The suspense/scary moments were plentiful. Gore and nudity as usual. There is even a shower sequence (a nod to Psycho ?)
The DVD can be seen in 2D and 3D. So far I watched it in 2D - the 2D print was kind of grainy for the first 18 minutes but was ok from there.

257799,4,6300214311,"This is a review of the 3-d aspect of this movie and not the film itself.

I have seen only one 3-d movie in the theater (Beowulf) and two 3-d dvds (counting this movie).  This dvd is not as good as digital 3-d seen in modern movies. This film uses anaglyph (red/blue)and is very good and tremedously helps the atmosphere of this movie.  However it is not perfect and in seems this dvd was not properly tweaked before it was released as ghosting (double images are frequent esp. during the first 2/3 of the movie.  Also to properly view this 3-d effect you need to follow these steps.

  sit at least 9 feet from the screen.

  watch in complete darkness.

  sit centered to the screen (the more of an angle the less of a
  3-d effect.)

  Use both of the glasses provided as the lenses are too thin when
  used singly (thanks to a you-tube reviewer!)

I also recommend viewing this movie on a large screen tv (I used a 42"" flat widescreen HD vizio and had excellent results.  When I used a 20"" flat HD monitor the 3-d was not as effective.)

Other ideas to improve viewing would be to adjust brightness or color on you tv (I didn't but it could help) buy an actual pair of 3-d glass not the paper ones (haven't done this and make sure you buy glasses that match the included ones left lense - red / right - blue as the reverse doesn't work!)

Please be aware of the following: ghosting and double images are still noticable, this package includes two red/blue glasses but if you follow my advice you will need several more pair if you wish to watch this movie with friends, whenever text appears on the screen it is blured or doubled and looks really bad (this only occurs 3 times), some scences shot in direct light lose the 3-d effect fortunately this does not occur during action sequences.

Overall I enjoyed this DVD and recommed it to anyone who likes 3-d and or 1980's slasher films.  Please note if you can't stand the 3-d or get it to work properly and still wish to see this movie there is a 2-d version included on this disc.",1234396800,4,2037,4.322751322751323

Television 3-D is far from perfect. The red and blue ""ghost"" can get annoying from time to time but sorry folks ... for now it's the way they have to do 3-D for TV. I was amazed how much depth there was and how little ""ghost"" I actually seen on this print. I was very much pleased with this release.
I wonder if it has anything to do with people's eyesight in their inability to see the 3-D proper ?",1234224000,2,592,3.9831932773109244
257802,2,6300214311,"Please note that this is a review of the new 3D DVD release, and does not reflect the actual flm, but rather, the quality of the disc itself. Those who purchase this should be aware of a few things up front. Firstly, the opening titles are NOT in 3D! They are in 2D. The 3D does not begin until the credits are finished. This is a MAJOR disappointment, as anybody who has ever seen the titles in 3D knows that the titles themselves are a show-stopper. In the cinema, the titles flew out of the screen within inches of your face. Why Paramount made the decision to not include the titles in 3D is beyond comprehension, and a major letdown right from the start. Secondly, the film is EXTREMELY grainy, and that does not help the 3D at all. They obviously did no restoration work whatsoever on this. The box says mastered in high definition, but you wouldn't know it by watching the DVD. The transfer is anamorphic, but the grain makes the film difficult to watch. Also, the DVD only came with 2 pairs of glasses, so you can only watch this with one friend, unless you already own more glasses.

As far as the 3D goes, it is pretty good, but because it is color anaglyph, the 3D is not the best quality. This was originally projected in theatres using polarized glasses, so the film was shown in full color, very similiar to how the Real-D cinemas and Imax 3D work. The conversion to red/blue anaglyph for home viewing is unfortunately not the best alternative. Some effects do certainly come right out of the screen on a properly calibrated monitor (LCD or plasma works best), and the depth is rather impressive, but the grainy transfer hinders the 3D effect at all times. It certainly doesn't come close to the 3D that was originally shown back in the 80's on the big screen.

If you've never seen this film before in 3D, you may enjoy this, and I guess it is better than nothing, but with a field-sequential 3D version already having been released in Japan ages ago on the long-dead VHD video system, it is rather disappointing to see Paramount making such little effort to releasing this properly. Sadly, there is no ideal method to release 3D on DVD at this time, since field-sequential requires special equipment to view, and does not work on LCD screens, making field-sequential an unattractive option to most studios and viewers, even though it does provide the best results.

NBC recently aired an episode of ""Chuck"", along with 2 Superbowl commercials, in 3D using the ColorCode 3D glasses, which are the same cardboard glasses only tinted yellow and dark blue instead of red and cyan, and the 3D was fantastic. Maybe this would have been a better choice for Paramount for home viewing, since ColorCode is more comfortable to view, and makes for a better 3D presentation, as there is much less eyestrain, and allows for full color viewing. Perhaps other studios will explore ColorCode for future home DVD releases.

For die-hard 3D fans or Friday the 13th fans, you will cerainly want to pick this one up, but just be aware before you start watching that it is flawed presentation.",1234137600,5,3088,4.62956204379562
257824,2,6300214311,"Okay picked up the new re-issue of FRIDAY THE 13TH in 3-D recently and felt I HAD to share this with other fans who are waffling on whether or not to pick this triple-dip up or not.

  First, let me say I have a copy of the old Japan-issued Polarized version (this requires the powered polarized glasses not the current red/blue paper things) and while it was a dubdown (the orig release in Japan was only on VHS) the 3-D was leaps and bounds better then this new release. Ok to be fair, I know it isn't very practical to release the old 3-D version in that format as it would require everyone to go out and spend at least $60-$130 on a pair of glasses to view it. So, with the recent release of some 3-D films in the new 3-D versions on home video(JOURNEY TO CENTER OF THE EARTH, POLAR EXPRESS etc) I figured it won't be too awful when redone in the red/blue format will it? The answer is both yes and no.

  First off this new re-issue of the film lays claim on the cover to be from an HD Source? Well, where is the Blu Ray then (Grrrrrrr). And this new print of the film is FILTHY DIRTY! I mean the old one in the box set was speckly and dirty, but this print is waaaaay granier and just plain AWFUL. Somehow they have managed to make the film look like a bad VHS dub down on dvd! Setting aside the dirty elements problem, the new 5.1 mix on the audio? Sorry compared it to the box set original audio mix, didn't notice a dang thing that was any different.

  But what of the 3-D you ask? How was that? Well, for the most part it offers some good 3-D dimension and does remind me a little of what it was like in the theater (I saw the film in 3-D back in 1983 at least 18-20 times) but not even close to the clarity. You see ghost images bleed off to the other parts of the image and its kinda messy. But the worst sin of all?! If you saw it originally in 3-D in theaters, you know how ultra cool the opening credit sequence is as it shoots out of the decapitated eye sockets of Mrs. Voorhees' head on the table. The credits literally shoot out and are right in front of your face (I do not exaggerate, this was waaaay better than any other 3-D movie has done before or after). Well what did Paramount decide to do? Well since the beg of PART 3 is a brief recap of the end of PART 2, they put a brief note onscreen that the beginning is not in 3-D. So the 3-D doesn't begin now until AFTER the credits are over!!!! In theaters, the 3-D begins with the shot of Amy Steel and BF outside out of the cabin (they are in front of it) and then we cut back to inside of cabin as Jason gets wakes and grabs his machete and gets up as we go to Mrs. Voorhees' head and the credits pop out of her eye sockets straight at you, out of the screen. All that is gone now, not even recreated for this 3-D version. Sad, very sad indeed. Lazy actually is a better word.

  Now you are wondering, how are the extras? Well, on this release we get a trailer for the 3-D version of the film that ran originally in theaters. And, err... thats it. You don't even get the actor audio commentary from the box set and this is a stand alone release asking you to buy it again?!?! Huh?

  So, in short, until we get that new Japanese 3-D home television technology over here, this 3-D version will have to do. Still, with the disappointments, one would have hoped for more pimped up extras, but seeing how it is Paramount (AKA cheap and no extras) its hardly surprising.

  Hope this helps some of you decide on this one. My opinion, rent it if you can and then quickly return it!",1234137600,4,3552,4.079022988505747

257827,1,6300214311,"First off, Most of the reviews on here are before this version was released last week. This is a review on this release. Not of the actual movie or plot. I pre-ordered it off Amazon and received last week. Watched off a PS3 on a 73"" Mitsubishi Diamond DLP and off a regular up kicking 1080i Toshiba DVD/VCR on a 40"" Samsung LCD to see if it was just a bad feed. But no. Same result off both setups.

Problem #1 only has 2 pairs of 3-D glasses. Would have liked to see 4 pairs in the box. But not the real problem.

The real reason for the low rating is the transfer. This is the worst transfer to DVD I have ever seen. Spoiler (opening shots are from part 2 and not in 3D. Then titles come for part 3 and not in 3D.) I was hoping that the picture quality would get better when the actual part 3 begins but with no luck.

Film starts in 3D after opening credits. I have Night of the Living Dead 3D (2006) and Journey to the center of the world 3D on DVD and just watched My Bloody Valentine in the theaters and Chuck on NBC in 3D so would rate the depth of the 3D as ok.

The problem is the picture quality. It's almost unwatchable. I would say it looks like someone took a Pan/Scan version off a VHS tape and zoomed it to 16x9 and copied it to a DVD without cleaning up the picture at all. Every picture flaw is noticeable. There are ghost images which are super highlighted by the 3D. Let's just say grainy pictures are no better in 3D. I then tried out the included 2D version on the same disc. No better. Same horrible grainy picture just without the pretty cool 3D depth.

As far as the movie goes, I liked the film minus I stopped watching it after about 20 minutes as it was bothering my eyes with all the picture noise. I have seen the non 3D version on both VHS and DVD years ago and prefer the picture quality of both compared to this.

Sound was ok. I have a 7.1 setup so it faked the 5.1 to 7.1 speakers so that was a plus. However sound rarely makes a movie.

You want 3D? You got it. You want decent picture quality? Wait for it be re-released again and restored this time. Or maybe hold out for it on Blu-Ray.",1234051200,5,2123,4.04047619047619

There are some drawbacks: because of the glasses, most of them film looks red and blue, and not like the natural colors of the movie. Then, there is some ghosting in some shots where characters appear to be doubled, or have a weird outline to them. But if you can forgive these flaws, you might find yourself really enjoying this. Some of the scenes in this film look pretty good for being a home 3D release. There is depth to a lot of the shots, and some of the scenes here just look really good. I was pleasantly surprised by how well some of it actually looked. Is it on par with the theater experience? No. But think of it this way: you can get this for $13. Come on. For that price, this is more than sufficient.

257853,3,6300214311,"Boy, are people confused.

The fact is....FRIDAY THE 13TH PART III was released ONLY in clear glasses, polarized 3-D to theaters. End of story. People that say otherwise are simply mis-remembering something from nearly 30 years ago. It just didn't happen. THe colored glasses have rarely been used for 3-D movies. Even in the 1950's all the movies were shown using polarized light and clear glasses. The anaglyphic downconversions came later, via TV broadcast and re-issue.

The theatrical version of FRIDAY THE 13TH PART III was excellent, with full color, great depth and amazing off the screen gimmicks. The opening titles shot off the screen and seemed to come right to the end of your nose. Audiences screamed with delight at them at each screening I saw.

While Paramount released a good field sequential version in 3-D years ago via a Japanese disc format, they have chosen to present this latest DVD in a red/cyan anaglyphic conversion only, so that it can be viewed on any TV with a simple pair of cardboard glasses.

How does it look? Just OK.  NOTHING like the original 3-D version, though. Gimmicks tend to disolve into double images here, the color is thrown off through the colored lenses, and the picture isn't so sharp. Worst of all...the wonderful opening titles are only in 2-D form! I guess they felt an anaglyph version of them wouldn't work well. A real shame, as the 3-D titles were the best part of the original polarized 3-D verion.

If you buy this, know that you are getting at best just an inkling of the original 3-D; but with all the TV/Blu-ray makers being so close to making quality 3-D at home a reality soon through improved shutter glasses formats, it is only a matter of time before a REAL 3-D version will hit the market on Blu-ray...until then, you'll have to settle for this anaglyph stuff.",1233705600,8,1828,4.732704402515723

If you are a Friday fan, this is a must purchase.  The movie looks great in 3D.  There are some problems with doubling here and there, but overall, it certainly puts things in the proper perspective.  I would even go so far as to say some 3D scenes rival those in the new My Bloody Valentine remake.  Don't get me wrong, there are problems with blurriness and doubling in some scenes, but overall the 3D in this release works.",1233619200,4,660,4.149606299212598

I don't mean they don't have depth, I mean they are seriously in 2D.  The 3D doesn't start until after the credits.
This is really lazy and sloppy and although I know it's not the end of the world, it still isn't complete now.  The 3D ""Friday The !3th"" coming out of Mrs. Voorhees eyes and then going out even further was really cool.

As for the rest of the 3D, yeah it pretty much is too blurry to see but you can definitely see depth and the 3D gags are very noticeable.  I have a bootlegged version of this movie (I think it was from Laserdisc maybe) and this is the same quality film as the bootleg.  (Except the bootleg has the credits in 3d!!).

If you are looking for a complete, real 3D version of this movie then go online and buy the bootlegged copy.  Quality is the same and it is complete.

This release sucks.

257857,3,6300214311,"Getting old is hell.  It's true.  You see, I'm old enough to have seen Friday the 13th Part 3 in the theater back in 1982.  There were a handful of pretty bad 3-D movies made during that brief resurgence of the fad.  Believe it or not, this was actually the best of them.  The film took full advantage of the process, poking every possible object, body part, etc. at the screen.  All in polarized 3-D.  Polarized?  Well, I don't know all the technical details, but the glasses were tinted gray, instead of the old-style red and blue that was used during the early 1950's heyday of 3-D movies.  A polarized 3-D movie doesn't just have depth; things literally pop off the screen and, at times, would appear to be inches from your face.

Sadly, this 3-D release of Friday the 13th Part 3 is NOT the same picture I saw all those years ago.

Apparently, the polarized process can't be recreated for the home screen (not yet, anyway. . .if you'd told me ten years ago I'd be able to store thousands of songs on a gadget the size of a cigarette lighter, I'd have called you crazy).  So what we have here is a sort of ""remixed"" cut of the film, with the old-school glasses.  And all the headaches those involve.

Disappointments aside, it's not a complete waste.  The film itself was made to have depth (as in the third dimension of depth, not the philosophical kind!), and many scenes translate fairly well.  The more notorious shock scenes (SPOILERS AHEAD) involving a spear gun and an eyeball rushing toward the camera come pretty close to duplicating the original format's intensity.  Objects in the background often suffer some blurriness--hence the possibility of headaches--and the print itself is surprisingly grainy in spots.

The film itself is no better or worse than any of the FRIDAY sequels.  But if you were lucky enough to have the film as intended on the big screen, you will almost certainly be disappointed with this presentation.  I'm glad 3-D films are making a comeback; I just hope someone is able to improve the process for home viewing.",1233619200,28,2053,4.634349030470914
257858,3,6300214311,"First off, this is not so much a review of Friday the 13th Part 3, but a review of the 3D aspect of this particular release.

Most of the 3-D, involving the characters themselves, is blurry. The main 3-D gigs in the film are intact and do come off the screen. Some of these gigs include: the laundry stick, the snake, the wallet, the baseball bat, the spear, the grass in the foreground when Chris and Debbie walk through the grass, and the yo-yo. Each of those gigs came off the screen enhancing the experience of this film.

However, throughout the film, you can clearly see clear bubble like structures around the characters most of the time, which might give you a head ache.

This release is far from perfect, but it is very fun to watch the gigs I have listed above in their 3D form as they are in your face.",1233619200,,814,4.30718954248366
257859,4,6300214311,"This Deluxe DVD Edition has some great stuff and not so great.  First the Great stuff:  The packaging is excellent with a holographic 3D slipcase that matches the new editions of part 1 and 2, making up a matching trilogy of sorts.  The 3D is NOT the awesome polarized process that I remember watching back in high school but is instead anaglyphic (red and blue glasses).  I've always been a fan of 3D films and saw all the 3D stuff back in the late 80's (JAWS 3D, AMITYVILLE 3D, PARASITE, TREASURE OF THE FOUR CROWNS etc.) and FRIDAY was always the best of the lot.  The polarized 3D was far superior to the anaglyphic (although more recent efforts in anaglyphic such as FREDDY'S DEAD and the terrific NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D have come a long way since ROBOT MONSTER and BLACK LAGOON).
So anyhow, I know a little something about how 3D should look and I've gotta say this is the most successful home video rendition of 3D I have seen yet.  There is true dimensionality in every scene and there are many terrific effects where objects (and body parts) fly off the screen at you.  Although I knew exactly what was coming, I still found myself ducking out of the way!  It is wonderful to see the 3D aspect of this film restored.  I viewed this DVD with a 1080p HDMI DVD player on a 50 inch 1080 LCD flat panel and the 3D effect came close to what I viewed this past weekend in the theatre watching MY BLOODY VALENTINE.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack has never sounded better and there are plenty of aural jolts in this presentation.  The two pairs of 3D glasses are designed well and have a hocky mask motif printed on them, not just white cardboard. / Now for the not so great: The 3D, although highly effective, has some SEVERE problems with blur and ghosting.  Occasionally lips end up on noses and eyeballs on foreheads.  It isn't enough to spoil the film but it makes me wonder why Paramount couldn't have corrected that.  It has the worst ""ghosting"" problem I have seen on a home video 3D release.  Also not so great is the 2D transfer which has in fact never looked worse.  This thing is ate up with film grain and dirt.  I know 3D films rendered in 2D for home video often have these problems but Paramount should have fixed this digitally, at least cleaning up the spots on the film and trying to calm down the artifacting and film grain.  Not great either is that the only ""special feature"" on this DVD is the theatrical trailer.  No commentary, documentary, photos, NOTHING.  Maybe those will turn up on a future Blu Ray release (forcing me to buy this title yet again). Also, this is the R rated version when a restored uncut version is certainly in order at this point.  Nevertheless I'm gonna give this one 4 stars simply because the 3D looked pretty impressive and the film itself is a classic.",1233619200,2,2814,4.43579766536965

I was in my local video store last night, saw this for sale, and immediately grabbed it up.

I specifically avoided getting the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-box-set/dp/B0002JP572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th box set</a>&nbsp;because they didn't offer the third movie in 3D. New Line Cinema had the right idea when they released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-box-set/dp/0780626966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare on Elm Street box set</a>&nbsp;with ""Freddy's Dead"" in 3D.

I must admit, I was very pleased at finally seeing this not only in 3D format, but widescreen format as well. I've watched the pan & scan version more times than I could possibly count - with roughly 66% of the scene getting trimmed to fit on a standard tv screen, that's a lot of lost material. The 3D glasses have Jason's hockey mask design on them...a nice touch.

Some of the better 3D sequences are as follows:

- Andy & Shelly's juggling scene
- The harpoon bolt scene
- The ""pass the joint"" scene
- Rick's ""eye pop"" scene

Here's the main issue I had with this version: unlike the newer versions of 3D films like My Bloody Valentine which were done in digital format, Friday the 13th 3D used an ""over and under"" technique which eliminated the need for dual projector set-ups, and produced widescreen, but darker, less vivid, polarized 3-D images.

Basically this means that in this edition, we have images that don't jump out like newer versions do. It's hard to focus your eyes on the action during the movie, people's faces are blurry during many sequences, and the color scheme feels like we're watching a movie in sepia tone.

Old-school Friday fans like myself will be happy that this version is finally out, but the lack of special features and the older format of 3D shows us that Paramount clearly wanted to cash in on the hype over My Bloody Valentine. I own it, I'm glad to have it, but I'm still waiting for a better version to come along with more extras.",1233360000,2,2570,5.597938144329897

257899,5,6300214311,"After purchasing a Mitsubihi 65"" HDTV 3D ready TV in early December I pre-ordered this back in December and finally got it earlier this week. I didn't view it until Friday night. Based on the reviews I read on here about it being double images, blurred pictures, and color distortions I thought it would be the same old lame release as in the past. So my expectations were not that high. I put my TV in 3D Mode with the 3D glasses option on my TV, slapped in F13th 3D in to my PS3 and from the DVD menu selected 3D version of the film. As this film starts off from where part 2 ended and as the close-up of Mrs. Voorhees head moves closer and closer the words ""Friday the 13th"" popped out of my television and into my living room. And then the Part 3. I couldn't believe it!!!. I actually was viewing this movie the way it was when I saw it in the theater in 1982. This was surreal!!!! I thought I needed special equipment to view it in 3D even with a 3D ready HD television. But no I didn't. I thought I was looking through a viewmaster from the 70's. Images were popping and coming off of my TV screen. From the rat that was on the ledge(I felt like I could reach out and pet it.) as Etna is about to be killed to Vera getting hit with the arrow in the eye it was like I was there with them but viewing it from my living room. I guess most of the negative reviews are coming from people who don't have 3D ready HD televisions. This is the key, you have to have a 3D ready HDTV in order for you to experience the 3D effect. You don't need any special equipment that will cost you over 100 dollars, no internet connected PC, or special software, just the 3D glasses provided with the DVD, that's it. Put your tv in 3D mode and enjoy theater like 3D quality from you living room. When I say theater like 3D quality I'm talking My Bloody Valentine 3D theater quality!!!. I saw MBV 3D in the theaters and this DVD version is neck and neck with the theater. Also to get the best effect you have to turn all the lights off. I'm still in awe of the 3D I witnessed on my TV last night. I know most of you have HDTV's but not 3D ready. If you decide to upgrade I highly recommend you get a Mitsubishi or a Samsung they have TV's smaller than 65"" that are 3D ready. The only negative is there are some double images throughout the film but the effect itself far outweights this. When the Blu-Ray DVD comes out it will be a clearer version of this film from my sources. This version was well worth my money and the unexpected suprise I got. I highly recommend every F13th fan buy this DVD and when you get an HDTV make sure you it's 3D ready.",1231804800,5,2632,4.083011583011583

257905,5,6300214311,"FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III is an awesome sequel and was the sequel that made both the brutal Jason Voorhees & his hockeymask an icon and still to this very day, since FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 was the the first installment to the FRIDAY THE 13TH saga phenomenom where Jason(Richard Brooker) uses his hockeymask, which was a marvelous improvement and upgrade from his bagged mask in FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2 along with the fact that FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III was the first and only FRIDAY THE 13TH sequel to be in 3-D, which was part of what made this movie so popular and such a big hit when it hit theatres back in the Summer of 1982 when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 during Ronald Reagan's presidency, which reminds me that FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 was released the same year as HALLOWEEN 3:THE SEASON OF THE WITCH, which was released in the Fall of 1982.

I also thought it was really cool how they had displayed all the credits at the beginning of FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 the way they had zoomed the words and letters of the credits in and back out instead of just using a black screen to display the credits right after after they had gotten through with showing scenes from FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2 where Paul(John Furey) and Ginny(Amy Steel) have a scuffle with Jason and barely get on with their lives after Ginny stabs Jason(Warrington Gillette).

In addition, FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III was the 3rd FRIDAY THE 13TH installment 3 years in a row, since FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 had been made a year later after FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART II was released in 1981 and released 2 years later after the original FRIDAY THE 13TH hit theatres in the Summer of 1980, plus I think director Steve Miner did an awesome job at directing both FRIDAY THE 13TH-PARTS 2 and 3 too, since Steve Miner has also directed other big hit horror flicks like HOUSE and HALLOWEEN H20, plus I liked the heartpumping music scoring done by Harry Manfredini in this movie too when he starts setting his sights on a bunch of immature teenagers at a farm retreat in Crystal Lake killing them off one by one right like flies on the same day they arrive too and even ends up getting 3 sleazy bikers in the process during his killing spree leaving only one survivor left(Dana Kimmell).

Additionally, I like most other people back then had assumed FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III was going to be the last & final FRIDAY THE 13TH installment, since they didn't make 4th sequels back then, but it just so happened that Paramount ended up making FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART IV:THE FINAL CHAPTER 2 years later, which got released in the Spring of 1984, which by the way had started fourth sequels for every other movie, including HALLOWEEN IV, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART 4, POLICE ACADEMY IV, ROCKY 4, PSYCHO 4, etc.

It's just too bad that Paramount couldn't make FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III in 3-D and that they don't make movies in 3-D anymore either, despite the fact that 3-D was a very popular thing in the movie theatres back in the early 1980's.",1227484800,3,3040,4.541970802919708
257956,4,6300214311,"Some fans name this as their favorite Friday the 13th film - but I'm not one of them.  Sure, Jason finally gets the hockey mask and really gets his slashing groove on, but there's no denying the fact that the silliness factor that marred the series as a whole began here.  Dope-smoking hippies and the world's worst and dweebiest practical joker definitely lowered my expectations early on, and the whole deal with opening the movie with an extended flashback of the climactic moments of the last film had already gotten old (plus, in this case, those events really have very little to do with the story as it unfolds here), so I was in a three-star mood about halfway through the action.  Jason really stepped up to the plate, though, delivering some pretty cool kills.  Maybe, just maybe, I might have been tempted to go all the way up to five stars if this were the original 3-D version released in theaters, but it's not (the 3-D version is apparently available only in Japan) - but I doubt it because I have a few issues with the film's blood and gore.  Regrettably, the film's best blood and gore had to be edited out in order to avoid an X rating, which is just silly.  Then you have the fact that two of the murders feature some of the fakest special effects you're likely to see.  As it is, I give the film four stars - thanks largely to Jason's standout work.

Having escaped an attack from a deformed, mad killer a year earlier, Christy (Dana Kimmell) comes back to the property to prove something to herself, but all she really proves is that she's an idiot.  Of course, she's apparently oblivious to the fact that Jason had just killed a gaggle of camp counselors the day before (although her old boyfriend Rick, being a local, certainly should have heard something about it).  Personally, though, if I ever drive up on an old coot sleeping in the middle of the road who proceeds to get up, shove a fresh human eyeball in my face, and warn me to go back where I came from, I'm turning around, brother.  Of course, all of Christy's friends are either too young or too stoned to worry about their mortality, especially when there's sex to be had just down the road.

So, basically, Jason has decided to hide out in a barn near Higgins Haven (and, despite what should be a massive manhunt for yesterday's Crystal Lake massacre killer, no cop even shows up to peruse the nearby lakeside property).  Upon arrival, Christy and her friends go into basic slasher film mode - with some hooking up, some getting high, and some taking a drive so that they can arrive back home right after Jason has killed all of their friends.  You know the drill.  This time around, the designated oddball is Shelly (Larry Zerner); not being the best-looking fellow around (not by a long shot), he keeps trying to impress the ladies by playing stupid practical jokes (as if the old machete-in-the-head joke ever impressed a woman anywhere on the face of the earth).  At one point, he even sports a wetsuit, underwater harpoon spear (huh?), and - wait for it - a hockey mask.

I believe this film was originally intended to be the final film in the series.  That is the only rationale I can come up with to explain the conclusion, which I found worthy of a few boos.  Not only are there some logistical problems involved with the whole idea, its payoff moment is of a distinctly ""been there, done that"" nature that pretty much backfires, in my opinion.  You can't call the same trick play two out of three downs and expect it to work both times.  Thankfully, the film made more money than its predecessors, paving the way for more Jason-style blood and mayhem in the years to come.",1225324800,,3667,4.517397881996974
257957,3,6300214311,"By this time there was no suspence left as to who the killer is. The opening credits inform us right away that Richard Brooker plays Jason. Yes Jason is the juggernaut who slices and dices his way through a small group of unsuspecting people. They just happen to be unlucky enough to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.

The movie starts off with a local drive by store near Camp Crystal Lake. A presumed married couple reside there. We are introduced to a stalking figure who hides behind the hanging laundry. We cannot see his face but we presume the worst.

This movie is undeniably Jason's movie. It is his coming out party of sorts. His identity is no longer hidden; just his face is. In this movie he recieves an iconic accesory which he will carry with him on the rest of his journeys.

We meet other characters in this movie shortly after Jason's roadside shopping excursion. They are a group of funloving young adults who are picking up some friends and taking a drive to an area near the infamous Camp Crystal Lake where ghastly murders just took place. On the way to their destination they are not aware of all of the blatant warning signs of evil that are marked all along their path.

They arrive and settle in. Not much happens for awhile except some socializing and a mishap at a nearby convience store. Night then begins to fall upon the area and that is where fun begins. It is Jason's area and he won't be denied.

This movie soon turns into a typical stalk and slash movie. We are then left with a final act that is full of that previously lacking suspense. And we even get to see the big man's face - which is quite scary-looking to say the least. And what we are left with in the end is more questions than answers - which is almost as entertaining as the previous sequel.

To add to the mystique of your usual Friday movies there are a few death scenes are quite good. And in this one Jason does not dissapoint",1223510400,3,1937,4.351800554016621

257959,4,6300214311,"My ""Friday the 13th"" marathon that began on Friday, June 13, 2008, continues with the next installment, ""Friday the 13th Part 3.""  And Jason returns to slaughter more beautiful, unsuspecting young people who have ventured into his woods.

  ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" is very different from the first two.  I envy those who saw it in 3D and wish it would be re-released at the theatres in 3D.  Perhaps 4D and this time we can smell the fear of the victims.

  This film is also presented in a much wider aspect than the previous ones, 2.35:1 versus the standard 1.85:1.  I believe I prefer the wider aspect.

  The characterization is much better than the previous ones.  There is Chris who must've been attacked by Jason and survived.  She still suffers from paranoia because of the incident and imagines that someone is watching them.  The best character, and the most three dimensional of them all, is Shelly who likes to play dangerous practical jokes in order to get attention.  We all can sympathize with his character.  At one time or another, we've pulled stunts in order to gain popularity, only to regret it later.  Unfortunately, Shelly never seems to learn that people like him for himself.

  I believe that I've always been afraid of hockey and hockey masks.  They make the players look so ferocious and evil.  And the ice skates they wear have blades that can slice your hands and face if they come in contact with them.  Shelly must've found hockey masks scary.  Why else would he be wearing one when he performs his last stunt to scare someone?  Jason also must've thought it would be cool to wear a hockey mask when he killed people.  Maybe that is why he killed poor Shelly and took it from him.  From then on, he wore it throughout the rest of his stalking career.  His competition, Michael Myers of ""Halloween,"" had a cool mask; perhaps Jason felt that he needed one as well.

  Great characterization and some gruesome, unique killings give ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" four stars.  Best scene is when the muscular gymnast walking on his hands is sliced in half by Jason's machete.  What a gruesome way to die!

  ""Friday the 13 Part 3"" is a must have for fans of the slasher genre.  In fact, the first four in the series are the best to own since they have a great story to tell of how Jason Voorhees became part of horror legend.",1213833600,3,2347,4.537170263788969

From the pranks and antics of Shelly to the rather goofy but entertaining hippie couple, the way cool but troublesome biker gang to Vera's death (that one was a doozy!), this movie delivers the goods. Also, this is the first ""Friday the 13th"" where Jason puts on the iconic hockey mask! Bloody chills and late-night thrills are flying like daggers your way on...Friday the 13th! So don't miss out on a classic slasher film, check this out as soon as you can! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1213315200,6,626,4.358974358974359
257961,4,6300214311,"Of all the Friday the 13th movies this one is my favorite of the series and would possibly make my top 50 favorite horror films. You know those movies you like a lot more than you should? Well Friday the 13th Part 3 is that movie for me. Sure this is your typical slasher flick with the typical horror movie characters, but there is just something about this movie I love.

By this time a formula for what worked well with this franchise was found and the makers were sticking to it. Even with the knockoff films that were being released around the same time the early Friday the 13th movies were able to edge them out and be a lot better. The biggest thing this movie has going for it is; this is the first time Jason wore the famous hockey mask.

Screenwriters Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson actually try and elevate the screenplay to be more than the typical stalk and slash movie. They seemed to have a few ideas, but it just wasn't quite there yet. I think this is one of the better written ones of the series, which granted isn't saying much, but Kitrosser and Watson do try and make more of the movie. There really isn't much in the way of plot, but than again this series isn't known for that. This one probably has the least amount of plot, but with that said is also has a little more than some of the others.

The characters mostly lack any depth, but they do come across as real people and that helps make up for the lack of character development. There were some interesting ideas presented, but weren't explored enough. There was a back-story with the character Chris and how she encountered Jason a couple of years back. The concept seems like it's going to lead to something, but it never comes about. I did hear that an original idea was a sexual assault and if you pay close attention to the dialog early it does seem like that was a direction the movie was heading.

But come a certain point the idea is dropped, which isn't a bad thing and we find out how Jason attacked her. Despite not really going anywhere it actually works in the favor of the movie and helped give Chris more depth. There was also a back-story with Rick and Chris, which normally in these movies feels very out of place, but it works rather well and adds some more depth to Chris and even a little bit for Rick that subplot could have been a disaster, but works well as does the story with Shelly and Vera; another one that could have been a disaster worked well.

That is why I go back to the script having some decent ideas. Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson had some good ideas with the Chris character and overall they had a good idea with the movie. It seems like they had some interesting ideas, but never fully developed it. The script though is simple and that is what helps it work.

Director Steve Miner is able to create plenty of atmosphere and looming dread; he manages to use his setting to his full advantage. In Friday the 13th Part II, Steve Miner very much followed what Sean Cunningham did with the original. In Friday the 13th Part III it seems he took some influence from John Carpenter. The shots of Jason watching and waiting to strike remind me a lot of Halloween; instead of being a carbon copy, Miner is also able to add his own style. While I liked what he did with Friday the 13th Part II, I felt he did much better here.

Steve Miner has made some enjoyable movies, but the problem with him is he doesn't really have an original idea he mostly follows what other filmmakers do, and this time around I do think he owes a bit to John Carpenter, but he is able to at times inject a little bit of his own style. Steve Miner has done some fairly good work in his career and while he isn't an Icon of the genre he has done a little more than people might realize.

Horror flicks work best when the characters are isolated and Miner gets the job done there. The pacing of the movie was done quite well. Once things slow down too much there is a shot of Jason, which helps keep the tension going strong. The kill scenes were effective and set up quite well done as well.

As stated before the characters come across as real people and I think are all quite likable. Friday the 13th Part III features my favorite characters of the series and some of my favorites in a horror flick. To be honest this is one of the few horror movies where I liked all the characters.

The acting wasn't bad either; what people seem to forget is this is a slasher movie Oscar worthy performances really wouldn't fit. The actors all do a fine job with their characters and come across as real people and that for me made me like the movie even more since when they died I felt bad for them.

Dana Kimmell who played Chris was by far my favorite character of the series and quite honestly might be my favorite character in a horror movie. I really just loved her character. Chris made a very strong and likeable heroine, while vulnerable also stepped up and fought back with everything she had in her.

Richard Brooker made an excellent Jason; he was big and strong but still had some human qualities to him. Richard Brooker is by far my favorite Jason. In my personal opinion Richard Brooker was by far the scariest Jason. I loved his movements and even at times his fun in killing and his frustration.

The scene with the spear gun was a classic moment. There are two reasons for that. For starters it's the first time Jason appears with the mask on and 2nd after he kills Vera he just walks away like it was nothing. I found Richard Brooker very creepy at times.

When it comes to horror movies the final act is so very important. A great horror movie could be ruined by it and an average horror movie could suddenly become much better cause of it. In my opinion the final act of Friday the 13th Part 3 just might be the most solid of the whole series. The first sequel had a good chase scene, but it was pretty much shot for shot the same thing as the first, even the way it was edited was the same.

The overall atmosphere for the final chase between Chris and Jason can be quite creepy. We all know horror flicks work at their best when the characters are isolated in a certain area and when you only have the killer and the intended victim in the isolated area it's even better. What made it work so well wasn't just Steve Miner's directing, but Chris being vulnerable, but not too scared to fight back, and Jason was quite creepy. The barn scene when Jason can't find Chris and he starts getting frustrated was a great scene, which now might look out of place cause of what Jason has become. But back in 1982 this was only Jason's 2nd outing so it wasn't out of character.

Friday the 13th Part 3 is far from perfect; make no mistake it does have its flaws. But it's also a well made slasher flick with a creepy villain and likable characters. Something some of the later installments didn't have.",1213315200,2,6899,4.328173374613003

257964,5,6300214311,"The first Friday the 13th is my favorite for being the original. I would classify this one, the second of many sequels to come as my next favorite! One of the things I enjoyed the most about it was Dana Kimmell's performance. Her character Chris is more layered than the female heroine characters in the other films (although Lar Park Lincoln did a good job as telekinetic Tina in part VII). Chris is troubled from a traumatic experience that is still running around in her mind. When Chris and her friends go away for the weekend, she begins to see and hear things. Is it just her imagination or has someone from the past returned? The chase sequence in the end is also my favorite in the entire series. It's long, but not too long and there are some very suspenseful moments to savor. Dana Kimmell is so enjoyable to watch, and I liked that her character was the ""morally proper"" type that one can respect and admire. After the night is over, the whole ordeal will have been too much for Chris as she goes off the deep end and into hysterics. I thought that was a very realistic approach for someone who has gone through something like this. The atmosphere has a very spooky touch to it and the high winds at night were great as opposed to using the rain we see so many times in a horror film. I would say that Jason is the scariest in this one (and also The Final Chapter) plus the murders were all very unique and different.

This film sets itself apart from the others in a few different ways. This does not take place at Crystal Lake Camp but at a place called Higgen's Haven. Maybe it's near Crystal Lake but the film never specifies. However a mummified Mrs. Voorhees does make a brief appearance in the lake near the end when she pulls Chris out of the canoe much like how Jason did with Alice in the original film. I thought that was a nice touch. The characters in this film also never say the name ""Jason"" as in the others. It's almost as if it were a completely different movie. Speaking of the characters, they were all made to be likeable as with most Fridays. This cast however seems slightly older than the cast in the other films giving them a more mature quality. This was one of the most successful at the box office (not counting Freddy vs. Jason) making almost as much as the first film. Obviously, having the 3D factor also sets it apart, but I have never seen it in that form. Someone once said because it was 3D they had a higher budget and the film gets a more mainstream look. As a horror film, I would easily give this 4 stars but Dana makes it a 5! Definitely one you can watch again and again.",1202342400,2,2623,4.309716599190283
257965,4,6300214311,"This is one of the few movies in the long-running Friday The 13th series that i actually liked a lot. Is this because the plot has gotten any better? No. Is this because the acting has improved? No. Is this because there's substance to the murders this time? Definitely not. This one is just simply likable in spite of the fact that it plays just like the first two films. Jason rises from the dead once more to prey on another batch of teens at the now infamous Camp Crystal Lake. There's plenty of gore this time for sure. There's also a much more thrilling atmosphere this time around as well as a much-welcomed sense of humor. Being that i wasn't alive when the original theatrical releases of almost any of the 80's Friday The 13th movies occurred, I only saw the video releases of these movies as a kid in the early 90's. But, I always hear that the original release of this movie was in 3-D. While i already liked this movie the way it is, I always was curious about what this movie was like in 3-D and would be happy if Paramount re-released this movie on DVD with the original 3-D version included. Anyway, This was a rather surprisingly enjoyable installment in the Friday series. This one is also notable for the debut of the now famous hockey mask that Jason is known for wearing in the movies. I reccomend this one to horror fans who don't want to think too much about the murder and mayhem that they're gonna see.

However, Jason really is quite dumb when you look at these movies objectivly. This crap can't decide if its B or not. That should never be a question. If its us, we're going B all the way. Instead of giving Jason that dumb limp, why not have him hop merrily from one foot to the other while chasing down his victims? The thing that made this one ridiculous was that the plot was predictable and there weren't any of those ""how did they get to this point?"" moments. A distictly non-B characteristic! Anyway, the only reason we decided on this one was because we remembered watching it years ago and marveling at the fact that these idiots kept going into the barn to get killed. They all looked like cows being led to slaughter. It would have been a 5-star effort if Jason was waiting in the barn, jumped out of a giant stocking, then killed. But, he didn't. That's why all these nerds loved it. The only saving grace was the fat kid. We couldn't wait for him to get offed, only they should have had DMX do it with his giant chain.

257998,2,6300214311,"It's hard to rate a film now that likely depended heavily on its effect in the theater.  Friday the 13th part 3 was released in the theater in 3-D.  3-D saw a popular revival in the early 1980s, so Steve Miner and Paramount Pictures wanted to follow-up his successful sequel to the original slasher film about Jason and his mom with a new sequel that could cash in even more.  It worked and Friday the 13th part 3 was a huge box-office success.  It grossed $36 million with a budget of $2.5 million.  Not too shabby.

The same formula is here that exists in all of these films.  Part 3 takes place right after part 2.  Jason survives, grows a few inches and gains a few pounds and goes to a store where he changes into something more menacing than overalls.  He of course kills anything that might be alive along the way.  Jason waits in a barn unmasked and begins killing those who enter.  He eventually wanders out and obtains his iconic goalie mask.  Like any Friday the 13th film, it has gratuitous content but it is even more evident due to the fact that it is supposed to be in 3-D.  There are clearly some things that are intentionally meant to pop out at you but don't because the 3-D version is not available on DVD.  This insane girl Chris at the lakeside resort where Jason is killing all these people eventually chops Jason in the head and kills him.  In imitation of the first movie's big scare, she ends up in a canoe in the middle of the lake and Jason's mother's reassembled head and body leaps from the lake and drags her into the murky green deep.  It worked the first time in the first film, although that was even somewhat derivative.  It worked less so the second time in part 2 when Jason jumped through the window.  At this point, it isn't really that scary and how the hell did Pamela Voorhees sew her head back onto her body anyway?

In Friday the 13th lore, there are rumors of an alternate ending which I think would've been far more appropriate and entertaining.  Instead of Chris dreaming Jason's mother jumps out of the lake, she dreams of Jason chopping off her head.  Part 3 really establishes the marketing drive behind these movies and Paramount took it and ran with it. It also established a Jason that was more worthy of audience cheers than screams.  Steve Miner had enough of this series and would not return for part 4.  I can see why, the series took a significant dive here and it would soon get worse.",1185321600,4,2443,4.3919821826280625

I think all of the characters bring something of their own to the movie. You have the main character Chris who invites all her friends to stay with her and Derek her boyfriend at his house at Camp Crystal Lake . The character Shelly was pretty wacky with his scare tactics, and you have the 2 pot smoking hippies and the motor cycle gang stalking them.

My boyfriend thankfully saw it at the cinema in 3D, and explained why the credits and everything else seems to come towards the camera at random points in the film. However, it does work well in 2D, but it still would have been good to see it in 3D. There's some gory scenes that would have had you ducking in your seat.

As much as I liked Friday 13 III, there are a few similarities to the previous movies. Able (the old man near the beginning) is much like Crazy Ralph from the first two films. It's a shame he only had a small part, cos Crazy Ralph's part was extended. Some of the other similar scenes include: Debbie seeing drops of blood falling from above, she looks up and a knife goes through her throat, almost exactly the same as Kevin Bacon's scene in the first film; after Chris thinks she had killed Jason she goes to sleep in a canoe on the lake much like Alice did in the first film; and when Chris awakes from the canoe Mrs. Voorhees comes out of the water and drags her under water much like what Jason did to Alice in Part 1.

You actually see Jason smiling in this film, which is quite freaky. I didn't feel as sorry for him in this film as I did in the last (with his mother), but there are a couple of odd bits, which I ended up thinking about. I'm not sure whether my boyfriend gave me this impression, or the film did, but there is the idea that the reason why Jason didn't kill Chris is because she passed out, so he decided to rape her. And her parents never told her what happened while she was out. But I just don't think Jason has the mental capability to rape someone. Considering how young he ""died"", he probably didn't know about the ""birds & the bees"" then. But then my boyfriend thinks he did rape her. It's one of those puzzling aspects of this movie.

The other puzzling thing about this movie (which I JUST worked out - how blonde am I?) is it's Friday 13th part 3 - but it's not actually SET on a Friday 13th. It actually takes place the day after the events of Part 2, making it Saturday the 14th. While the beginning of the movie takes place on the evening of Saturday the 14th, when the overweight store owner and his nagging wife are killed, the majority of the movie takes place on the following day, making it Sunday the 15th.

From various reviews, I've heard this is the last ""good"" Friday 13th movie. (Apart from Freddy vs Jason, is that included?) If that's the case, I still have the rest to watch! The only thing I wasn't keen on in this was the recap from the previous Friday 13th. Yes, it's always good to have a little reminder, but at this point, you just want to get on with the new film.

This is one of the better ones in the franchise... Yeah, we have people going on about originally... But it's pointless to complain as I think because everybody knows what these movies are before you even watch them. It's beating a deadhorse really...

Besides, this movie attempted to add abit of a story with the Chris/Jason thing... It just didn't explore it well enough. But the gore, and the feel of the movie make up for it.

We get some of the more gory kills and mood is good here. The film was in 3D at theaters and naturally you will not get the best of it on TV... But I enjoyed this entry due to the killings and the pace is better here. It doesn't hurt that Chris is possibly the best ""hero"" of the series.

258047,2,6300214311,"It's the third entry in the Friday the 13th series. So what do we get that's new? Jason gets his mask, the film was filmed in 3d, and we get a lead chick who has a past with Jason. That's about all of the new. The original F13 formulas we love are there: the new group of teens who will eventually be offed in a variety of gruesome ways, the random people over the age of 30 who get offed, POV shots, the chichichi score (yet in disco form this time around!), and the lead chick who has no idea what's going on until the final showdown where she eventually survives but goes crazy. Yes! Good times in store.

 And good times are had with F13 pt 3. There were actually some characters that you begin to care about before Jason gets to them. The one who stuck out the most was Shelly, the awkward gore FX freak who only wanted to be accepted. I liked him. He should have been the hero instead of the heroine we got. Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, was a bit of a nuisance to me. I don't know why. I just didn't enjoy her.

 I do want to mention that this entry does have one of the creepiest moments in the series to me. Near the end, where Chris is in the canoe in the lake, and she sees Jason staring outside of a window sans his mask, and he growls? Yeah, creeps me out. And from this, I will go on to say that Steve Miner's (who later went on to director H20, a favorite of mine) vision of the film was great.

 But still, fun times are had with the film. The kills are great (thank you, spear gun). Jason's getting to the top of his game. And we're led on to The Final Chapter, which is definitely 2 steps up from the third entry.",1149984000,,1632,4.021604938271605
258048,2,6300214311,"Anyone who has viewed the first two installments in the Friday the 13th series can skip part 3, as they have already seen it.  The director from Part 2 returns to offer audiences every where an exact duplicate copy of his original attempt at a Jason movie.  The movie starts with an exceedingly long flashback of the ending to Part 2 (not re-enacted mind you, just lifted directly from that movie), moves on to the youthful cannon fodder heading into the woods where they are yet again warned by a crazy old man to avoid the death that obviously awaits them, they are stalked and murdered one by one without being granted the opportunity to warn their friends that a killer is amongst them, and finally a grand chase scene occurs with the lone survivor.  Ad Naseum seven more times, and you have the Friday the 13th series.  Part 3 was originally filmed in 3-D, which is pretty obvious to everyone who isn't wearing 3D glasses, as they will have yo-yos, baseball bats, eyeballs, shovels, and an odd assortment of other items thrust directly into the camera, which was probably just as silly when viewed as originally intended.

The paradox of Jason is taken to whole new level in this chapter of the series.  Many viewers have asserted that Jason is not actually a psychopath or even an intentional murderer, but actually an unbending force of nature such as a hurricane.  Others take the view that he became insane while living alone in the woods for years, and he doesn't understand the difference between life and death.  These arguments might have held some merit if Part 3 had never been added into the sequence.  Whether  intentional, or simply a product of the various directors' and screenwriters ineptitude at movie production, it is quite clear that Jason has magical powers of some kind, and is highly intelligent.  Despite appearing to be a lumbering hulk of a man with a mild form of mental retardation, Jason is able to stealthily sneak his way through forests, homes, and shops without ever being noticed.  He can hide under a hammock without being seen, walk directly by someone and stand behind them with being noticed until the person turns around, blend into the forest like a chameleon, lie in wait for hours on end until someone enters a basement or finally goes off into the forest alone, and breathe underwater for indefinite periods of time.  Since it's assumed that at least some of the people in the world lock their doors, he is also an expert at picking locks (unless people have seen him, in which case his magical lock picking ability is nullified and he MUST break down doors and windows with his hands or a machete).  Jason can also make recently deceased bodies, and all the forms of blood and gore associated with these bodies, disappear without a trace, so no one would ever be able to tell that another individual was recently hacked apart with a machete in the room.  He also displays keen intelligence and a desire for revenge in this movie, as he takes the time to remove his mask and reveal his face to someone who had previously escaped his clutches, for the sole purpose of letting this person know that escaping him is not a possibility.

Continuity is a serious problem here.  Towards the beginning of the movie several characters are discussing a time in the past when the heroine Chris was chased by a bogeyman of some sort in the woods.  Initially this incident is placed at five years before the present.  A few minutes later when the subject is brought up again, it suddenly has changed to two years in the past.  Later, when the subject comes up again, it is referred to as occurring ""last summer"".  People will randomly have different clothes or accessories on in the same scene when the camera cuts away from them, characters repeat actions twice in a row for no apparent reason, and camera/crew equipment is frequently visible.  Astoundingly, the acting is even worse than in the second movie, which is a feat that really shouldn't have been possible.

Although there are a few fun frights and some decent gore, overall Friday the 13th Part 3 is a movie that didn't need to be made, and everyone except Jason fanatics can safely skip it without missing out on anything.",1149724800,,4222,4.683355886332882
258049,3,6300214311,"Friday the 13th Part 3~ Terry Ballard was originally shot to be a 3-d movie and many of the shots show this like the intro, the eye, the pitchfork and many others. The acting is surprisingly good for a 80's slasher flick. The music though the movie and especially the opening and closing track is downright awfull and the special effects are ok but look cheap even for when the movie was made. The plot is not paper thin but pretty close to it and the dialogue is better then most other horror sequells. I have no idea why some of the scenes like the one with the crooks are in it but I guess they need to have a movie that topped 90 minutes. Take it for what it is and it is a slasher movie that gets 3 out of 5 stars.",1147219200,,719,4.0
258050,1,6300214311,"Gather around, young children, for I have a tale to impart. It is of a young boy with a severe Oedipal complex who lived on Crystal Lake. The days of peaceful skinny-dipping and sweet young love are gone. Jason's mom has died at the hands of some buxom girl, and Jason is out for teenage blood. Please don't look behind the hockey mask, for it is horrifying. He is scarred, nearly mutated. He seems to possess super-powers because he is incapable of dying. Accept your destiny because he will always come back. Forget about slicing and dicing this once-kind lad. He is indestructible. Run for your life. No, don't go into the woods and down the road. That would make too much sense. Lock yourself in the house. Stand still. Breathe and wait to die.

There you have it my dear on-lookers. This is the story of Friday the 13th Part 3, the same story as in just about all the sequels to Friday the 13th, except this time Jason goes to New York City. Since I was six years old when this film came out, my parents had little interest in taking me to this film. This is unfortunate because I will never get the chance to relish what might have been pretty nifty 3D effects

The film was shot in 3D and looks pretty bland on video or DVD. A kid is about to swing a bat and it is strangely positioned near the filmmaker's camera lens. Ditto for a variety of other objects like a rope, a yo-yo, and a spear entering the eye of a Hispanic girl who only carries food stamps in her wallet. Without the ability to experience the 3D aspect, all that remains are gratuitous shot compositions.

Watching this film is an unbearable experience because it rehashes the original's formula. There is no spontaneity, just by-the-numbers killings surrounded by crude filler material. The audience is aware that the purpose of the film is to see Jason kill a couple of a teenagers, with one teenager (two, if you're lucky) surviving at the film's end. There is no need to hear couples talk about sex and relationships because the material serves no lasting purpose. Our emotional attachment is to Jason's slings and arrows.

Director Steve Miner gets credit for the camp element, though. It's delightful hearing characters say such things as ""you put this barrier between us and I want to break through"" or ""nothing is going to happen if we're all here together."" He seems to have fun with the idea of the teenager in peril and he flies with it. But all of this is ultimately irrelevant because the film is not particularly scary. An opening flashback reminds us of the events that transpired in the first two films causing us to expect more of the same. Teenagers will dress like Pat Benatar and smoke as much pot as they want and when they take off their clothes, heads will fly.",1141948800,2,2757,4.519038076152305
258051,3,6300214311,"Jason (Richard Brooker) continues to roll up the body count in this somewhat lame and very predictable sequel.  Jason has managed to survive having a machette thrust into his neck at the end of part 2, and now he has come upon a small general store and its two unsuspecting occupants.  Soon, they are added to Jason's body count.

Meanwhile, another group of ""innocent"" and horny teenagers are on their way to the lake.  Chris (Dana Kimmel) has survived an earlier encounter with Jason.  She ran away from her house and ended up alone in the woods.  That was when Jason tried to attack her.  However, she blacked out and somehow ended up back in her own room.  She's come back to finally get rid of her fears.  Several of her friends have decided to come along.

Their first mistake occurs when Chris and Shelley go into town to buy groceries.  They run into a rough motorcycle gang.  Unfortunately for Shelley, he backs into one of the motorcycles, which in turn knocks over the rest.  Enraged, the gang takes off after Chris and Shelley.  They follow Chris and Shelley back to camp where they decide to burn down the barn, but Jason get ahold of them before they can carry out their plan.

After that, the teenagers start dropping off one by one until Chris is left to face Jason alone.  Will Chris survive, or will Jason add her to his ever-growing list of victims?

I thought this movie was worse than the first tow.  This was billed to be even more scary, because it was filmed in 3-D.  The 3-D effects may have looked good in the theater, but they are non-existant on the DVD.  The plot of this series has become very predictable, and there is nothing really different from the first two movies of the series.  Jason does find his trademark hockey mask in this movie, however.

I recommend this movie only if you are serious about watching every following one.  One aspect I do like is that there is a short recap of part 2 at the beginning of this movie.  This helps the viewer in case one forgot what happened previously.  Hopefully, the movies following this one will get a little better and everything won't be so predictable.",1141084800,,2136,4.514360313315927

258053,5,6300214311,"The Friday the 13th series is my favorite horror movie series, and Part 3 is my favorite. It has all the elements of a good horror movie, which I'll get to in a minute, and Jason I think is the creepiest he ever was.

*This was the first horror movie I ever saw. It was on TV and I watched a part of it at age  7 or 8 while my parents weren't watching me :). I saw the shower part in the movie and needless to say I didn't take a shower for two weeks. I'd go in the bathroom and turn on the water, but I wouldn't get in because I was afraid I'd open the shower curtain and get an axe in the head. :)

  I know the chances of you reading my review out of 217 other peoples reviews, and I know that people have given this movie pretty high marks, as well as low. But I think this is the best movie out the series and here's why.

  I always look for three things in horror movies. The first is, is the movie well made and is the acting up to par. This movie looks creepy. It's kind of dark many times which just adds to the feel of it. It has that 1980's feel which really gives a horror movie an edge in my book. The scenes are all well put together and the directing is right up there. The acting is pretty good for the most part. Sometimes Cris is a little unbelievable in the beginning but she is the prettiest girl out of the whole series. The rest of the actors do a great job especially Jason.

  This is the movie that started the whole hockey mask mania. In the later movies, Jason got more of a personality, especially once Kane Hodder took over, but they kindof ruined the character for me. Jason is supposed to be a mindless emotionless killer, which is what makes him so scary. When they gave him emotions and facial expressions in part 7 and Fred Vs J, they ruined the character for me. In this movie, Jason walks creepy, takes his time and gives a great performance. Nice job.... uh..... guy.

  The next thing I look for is are the death sequences well done and believable. If you've read my other reviews you know nothing turns me off faster than an elaborate and stupid death sequences. In this film they do it right. They are all quick, show some blood but not too much and all could have really happened. With the exception of the spear gun through the eye, but I'm sure Jason is an excellent marksman.........I'm not going to argue with him.

  The last thing I look for in a horror movie is a great ending. I thought number two was pretty decent but had a lot of mistakes in it. Some things in the movie just don't make sense, especially the end. What dog was in the woods if that other white fluff ball came back??? but anyway....

  Part 3 really brings the first movie into play. It's a nice reverse at the end, without giving too much away. I always felt that this should have been the sequel, instead of two because of the way it ended.

  All in All this is a great horror movie. I would rank it number one in the series, with four next, then one, then probably the others, with the exception of seven. It's the first horror movie I ever saw, and it will always hold a special knife-hole in my heart. Alright so that wasn't funny, but this movie is great. My favorite scene is the fuse box when the guy gets the lights to go on, but who's behind him????? CHI CHI CHI MAH MAH MAH",1137628800,9,3304,4.11214953271028

Cast:  Dana Kimmell, Paul Kratka, Richard Brooker, Nick Savage, Rachel Howard, David Katims, Larry Zerner, Tracie Savage, Jeffrey Rogers.

Running Time:  93 minutes

Rated R for extreme gore and violence, language, and sexual situations.

Jason has survived the massacre from ""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" and continues on his way, butchering two more people in a truck stop diner. This doesn't stop a new group of friends from going to the lake for a good ol' weekend of sex and relation. While their, two of them, Shelly (Larry Zerner) and Chris (Dana Kimmell) leave the lake to go buy supplies, and run afoul of a local biker gang. Shelly nearly destroys the leader's (Nick Savage) bike, and they vow payback on the kids. While sabotaging their van, two of them get killed by Jason, who the kids don't know is there. With Chris and boyfriend Rick (Paul Kratka) enjoying a talk in the woods, they begin to suspect foul play when their car dies out. Shelly ends up scaring a girl he likes, Vera (Catherine Parks) who sends him away. He goes into the barn, where he thinks Chuck (David Katims) and Chili (Rachel Howard) are, but runs into Jason. Jason goes back and kills Vera, then goes into the cabin were the kids are 'sleeping' and kills two more, leaving only Chuck, Chili, Chris and Rick; no one aware of Jason's presence. Jason now launches an all-out assault on the camp, leaving only Chris and Rick, leading to a solo fight against the killer.

Director Steve Miner returns to the helm for his second sequel in a row, both does not pull through as he did with ""Part 2""; his inability to build up any good scares or shocks as well as the fact that he takes too long to get the movie going. His direction hasn't improved much at all and he's certainly not helping himself by not trying anything new or different in this film. There are a few memorable death scenes, particularly one guy who gets slashed in half when he's walking around on his hands, but these moments aren't built up to particularly well, there's no sense of dread and almost no suspense; what little of it is there is mainly because of Harry Manfredini's very effective and creepy Ennio Morricone-esque score.  The gore effects are in more abundance than in the previous two films, but they still look rather cheesy sometimes.  The film is actually saved by a very riveting, exciting finale, in which all the cliches are used, such as the car that (in)conveniently runs out of gas, the dead body in the closet, the killer who's really not dead, etc., but Steve Miner actually handles the entire sequence quite well.  Overall, a sequel with much to be desired; however, at least it created a Halloween icon with its first usage of the famed hockey mask.  The first two films were much better.",1135900800,,2787,4.630831643002028

258086,3,6300214311,"YES, like Jaws 3, Amityville 3, and countless others during the early 80s, Friday the 13th jumped on the 3D bandwagon.  Out of the 3D movies I mention here, Friday the 13 may have been the best (Amityville was awful and boring, and Jaws was just plain laughable).  I must say that this is not one of my favorites of the series though. It ranks pretty low on my list.  The only 2 things that even make this entry notable is the fact that it was done in 3D and also this is the entry where Jason gets the infamous HOCKEY MASK. One reason for my dislike is that the acting was below average and most of the characters unappealing and drab.  The lead female, Chris, played by Dana Kimmel was not the right choice.  She sounded so whiny whenever she said anything and her back story had more holes in it than Jason's hockey mask.  One funny thing that I always like to bring up, is that this is the ONLY entry in the entire series that no one mentions the name ""Jason Voorhees"".  Kinda strange, considering the fact that in every other entry everyone seems to know of and fear ""'ol Jason"". No one seems to even mention Crystal Lake (execept for the news broadcast on tv), Mrs. Voorhees, or the murders that just happened from part 2 (which in this movie they make it seem like it only happened days before).  It just doesn't seem like this one fits in with all the rest in the series. Some other aspects that leave me dry is the location this was filmed.  The ""lake"" did not live up to the famous name, it looked like a polluted creek.  You can tell this was filmed in a tropical climate because in one shot you can even see a friggin' palm tree (this was filmed in CA, opposed to the first 2 which were filmed on the east coast). However, some of the 3D effects are rather interesting (even though we don't see it in actual 3D on the dvd).  You can tell which parts were meant to be 3D (pitchfork handles, popcorn popping, a yo-yo, a squished eyeball popping outta a guy's head, a shooting spear gun).  The ending of this one reaches new depths of silliness.  They basically rip-off the ending of the 1st film but with NONE of the style or shock.  Chris is in a canoe when an apparent Mrs. Voorhees (with her head mysteriously back on) jumps out of the lake and pulls Chris under.  Even if it was a dream, it doesn't make much sense because no one mentions Jason or Mrs. Voorhees in the movie, so I doubt Chris would be dreaming about being attacked by someone she's never (to our knowledge) heard of.  But, this entry made a killing at the box office, making the 2nd biggest profit of the series, after part 1 (without counting Freddy vs. Jason which did huge numbers).",1135123200,,2666,4.302
258087,4,6300214311,"F13th part III is one of the best films on the entire franchise, but... it lacks the 3D feature and the main plot of the movie can be cheesy, but beliable.

The film centers in... one day later after part II. The first few minutes of the movie shows the last minutes of part II plus some things that we didn't see in that movie, you get to see that Jason is still alive and breathing, he then goes to this mini store near camp crystal lake, and he kills the owners then gets new clothes.

After this a group of like.. 7 people get to go to this place called Higgins haven (dont know if this is spelled right) near that mini store at the beginning of the movie. This place is not a camp, but a vacational spot for the teenagers, however.. the setting is sooo incredible (specialy the house and the barn) that you are going to rewind your movie everytime you see it, it just looks sooo great... but the lake looks like a swamp... not exactly like that, but you can see that the water is not clean. Another thing is that in this movie Jason stays in the barn for the most part of the film, and almost all of the kills scenes are there.

The good thing about F13th is that it looks so different from the others films (personal opinion) from the fictional place, to the characters, here you get to see the handsome, virgin (the main character and not so memorable) two horny girls, the clown (and one of the best characters in the franchise), the crac smokers, and some random biker guys.

The Main character of the film named Chris, is not memorable due that her lines are soo cheesy, one of them are: ""He had a knife... and he attacked me with it!"" she also looks very insecure, the actress didn't perform that character properly. there are some rumors out there that she complaint about the ending (Chris was supposed to be killed) and about some nudity and sex scenes... In less words there were going to be more interesting scenes, if the original ending wasn't cancelled F13th part III would be the first and different film in the entire franchise.

the producer had this idea coming to their head, to replace that good and DARK ending of the movie... replacing it with a CHEESY and stupid scene of Mrs. Voorhees popping out of the lake and grabbing chris, pulling her unders (another continuity error, and it was  a copycat of the first film) this is a continuity error, cause Chris never knew about Jason or Mrs. Voorhees. the characters doesnt mention the name of Jason throughtout of the film, so you will know..

What really bugs me about this movie is that it has some serious plot holes and continuity errors, one example of them is that you could see Jason with some hairs over his head (part two) , but in this film he is completely bald, of course maybe there is an explanation to this, but it wasn't never explained in this film. ONE SERIOUS error that is very very annyoing is that the DVD case says ""A group of naive counselors"" and however, they were NOT counselors.

Overall... if you can get past Chris, some plots holes, the lack of the 3d feature and the ending, you are good to go..",1134777600,,3102,4.373263888888889

258089,4,6300214311,"While FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 2 left some to be desired, the ending to that movie was satisfying and ultimately led us into this third and impressive entry into the popular horror series. While the intro credits score was a little cheesy, the movie itself is anything but that. Thanks to a better cast, a biker gang, and a little more believable hormone-driven agenda, this entry is worthwhile for all fans of the series. While no longer presented in 3-D on DVD (the 3-d was cool), you can still feel hints of that technology in some of the movies scenes featuring Jason's weapons of choice.

Once again, Camp Crystal Lake is open for business and another population of sex-inspired teens are on duty for more. Not only that, but we also have a biker gang that adds more to the movie than just the counselors...now anyone can go if Jason don't like you...and he doesn't. He wastes no time in dispatching away one counselor or biker after the other (the biker that got the pitchfork got the worst of it, ouch!). This is also the first movie where Jason finally dons the hockey mask, which is now a most sought after costume accessory where I'm from. There are many good scenes in the movie, especially where poor Jason is hanging and then finally gets free...there's just no way to stop him, he seems to be invincible. The ending, of course, leaves the movie open for what would be one of the most superior of the series, THE FINAL CHAPTER.

But while you sift through the series, don't skip over this little goody. This a landmark in the series as it shows the first scenes of Jason in his official mask. FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 3 is a must-see for anyone who wants to see where Jason ""officially"" came to life. You've been warned...",1130112000,,1727,4.514376996805112

It was a better try than first two but still not as good as first class horror movies. Most of murder scenes were good specially when Jason split up that boy into two parts I reallt got excited! but Killing Rick by pressing his skull although was good at concept but was fair in production. Jumping out one of his eyes from a soft plastic face was more like some of that games in play houses! Nowadays they make every thing they imagine with CG, natural and beleavable! but in old movies I think they should have not created scenes that they couldn't made them perfect!

This is the first Friday the 13th film to feature Jason with his hockey mask which he stole from one of the characters and idea is used in all the future F13 films also. Jason has some nice kills in this film including a girl getting shot in the eye with an arrow. I do however think that all the young people in this film are crackheads. For some reason they seem dumber than in any other of these films and are the perfect example of what characters will die. However I do like this film a little better than part 2 and I think of it as about as highly as part 1.,1121385600,2,674,3.963235294117647

It would've been a lot cooler in 3D.  They need 2 get a 3D release of the DVD.  That would've been cool.

258145,4,6300214311,"This review refers to the Paramount DVD edition of the film.

THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Dana Kimmell, Paul Kratka, Tracie Savage, Jeffrey Rogers, Catherine Parks, Larry Zerner, David Katims, Rachel Howard, Richard Brooker, Steve Miner. Score Composed By Harry Manfredini. Title Theme Co-Written By Michael Zager. Directed By Steve Miner. (R) For Violence, Gore, Profanity, Drug Use, Very Brief Nudity and Mild Sexual Content; 95m.; 1982.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Well, there may not be any camp counselors in this one, but there are definitely enough victims for the misshapen maniac Jason Voorhees to slice and dice his way through. Picking up mere moments (screen time) after its predecessor left off, we find a group of vacationing friends traveling to a small house located in the general vicinity of Crystal Lake. Instead of the carefree recreation they were searching for, they find a gruesome killer stalking them at every turn. After his success with part two of this franchise, director Steve Miner returned for another unnerving outlet of terror. Unfortunately he's now working with standard material that, while suspenseful and still intriguing, has lost its ability to downright shock the audience. The players in this film have reverted back to the original ""Friday the 13th"" by being offered generic representations of youth culture. Even bikers Ali (Nick Savage), Loco (Kevin O'Brien) and Fox (Gloria Charles) are garden variety examples of their brethren. However, the actors involved rise above the material and turn in remarkable performances nonetheless. Of particular interest is leading lady Dana Kimmell as Chris and the humorous flunky Larry Zerner as Shelly, a wannabe actor and lover of practical jokes who inadvertently provides Jason with his trademark hockey mask. Other cast members include Tracie Savage as the pregnant Debbie, Jeffrey Rogers as Debbie's quasi-macho boyfriend Andy, Catherine Parks as Shelly's blind date Vera and Paul Kratka as reliable country bumpkin Rick. Rounding out the ensemble is David Katims and Rachel Howard as the stoner couple Chuck and Chili. ""Crazy"" Ralph's prophet of doom position has been replaced by the fabulous Abel (David Wiley in an all too brief segue). True ""Friday"" fans relish this film for the presence of Richard Brooker as Jason Voorhees, the incontrovertible king of the role. Years later, Kane Hodder would go on to play Jason more often and to much critical acclaim. But all of the little traits and quirks he brought to the role were carbon copy rip-offs of what Brooker had already accomplished. Trivia buffs take note: the man who co-wrote the film's opening theme is disco legend Michael Zager whose band performed the hit song ""Let's All Chant"" in the late seventies. Also, director Steve Miner briefly appears as a television newscaster. Overall, this film is a solid entry into the ""Friday the 13th"" film canon. It recognizes the classic heights reached by its predecessors and doesn't assume it will automatically reach those same levels. Miner and his cast work hard to make this a memorable movie without relying on name power alone.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: This film comes with a 2.35:1 widescreen transfer that, not surprisingly, looks like it was converted from an old VHS copy of the film. The presentation has a certain fuzziness to its quality and has regular intervals of grain making it the worst of the original three transfers. However, in a startling one-eighty, the accompanying 2.0 mono track is the clearest, most precise audio track to be included on a ""Friday"" film. The separation is very good and each sound is uniquely perceptible. There's a great tonality to the lower registers as well. A French mono track is also available for the film. English subtitles for this disc have a wonderful yellow coloring and have been placed within the frame of the movie. The cover for this DVD is a veridical reproduction of the original video release cover. The back cover is a bland excuse for a montage of film photos and information. The one sheet insert that comes with this film features better stills than the back cover and also spotlights the fourteen chapter stops for this ninety-five minute movie. The DVD itself is a silver top affair and features the same painting scheme (film title, Paramount logo, etc.) utilized on the discs for parts one and two. Continuing the tradition for the ""Friday"" films, the only extra available on this disc is the original theatrical trailer (2:13). The trailer is a sad reminder that this film was originally presented in the 3-D format, although Paramount foolishly (for whatever reason) did not return the film to its full third dimensional glory for this DVD release.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: Paramount has never been known for plying their releases with additional footage, let alone hiding anything on the disc. You're more likely to make friends with Jason Voorhees than you are of finding hidden easter eggs on this one.

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Debbie (Tracie Savage) appears in a blue bikini while sunbathing. We then have the pleasure of watching her take a shower. While the viewer doesn't see too much, what we are allowed to see of her is lovely. Regrettably the ravishing Latin vixen Vera (Catherine Parks) isn't given the opportunity to express any true sexuality.

THE GORE REPORT: One of the girls is speared through the eye but there's not really that much blood. Another cast member has his head squeezed until his left eyeball pops out of its socket. Another luckless character loses a hand and one guy has a very realistic gash across his throat that should give cinematic bloodhounds a thrill. Even Jason gets in on the action by receiving a very bloody ax wound to the head. But the best scene of gore in this third film is when we see one of the young men split in half with his bloody intestines hanging out.

SAY AGAIN: ""Why do you always have to be such an a**hole?"" - Andy (Jeffrey Rogers). ""I beg your pardon. I'm not an a**hole. I'm an actor."" - Shelly (Larry Zerner). ""Same thing."" - Andy (Jeffrey Rogers).

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. Even though Paramount has not reinstated the 3-D format for the film, it's still a worthy successor to the original two ""Friday the 13th"" features. It's more suspenseful than most of the remaining sequels and has a handful of scenes that will stick in the viewer's mind long after they've finished watching the film.

258146,2,6300214311,"Lmmfao... hahaha! Ok, this is, in my opinion, the worst & cheesiest of ALL the Friday films. This is the kinda movie that I had to take like 3 or 4 good bong hits & a couple beers & just get totally ripped before I could watch it... it kinda makes it funny... like when that fat guy with the fro that plays stupidass jokes on everybody runs over the bikers' bikes... & when Jason squeezed that one guys head & that totally fake eyeball popped out... I laughed my ass off! Even that 80's sounding music at the beginning made me crack up! But... it is the movie where Jason first puts on his trademark hockey mask... that was kinda cool. (Didnt he get it from that idiot with the fro? I forgot, I was too high... hahaha)

Oh, & I've heard about this 3-D version of the film... I ahvent seen it, but I'm sure its the same cheesy film just in 3-D. Now I realize that some horror films are made to be cheesy, but this was just BAD acting, BAD effects, hahaha... ok, I;ve said enough. I'm gonna go smoke another bowl.

258147,1,6300214311,"Yet another group of sex-crazed teens arrives near Camp Crystal lake (not even in the camp this time) and are brutally murdered.  One of them this time is a girl who was raped by Jason many years ago (showing, I guess, that Jason too is sex-crazed).  Their group is hassled by some biker punks who wind up being killed by Jason also.

Oh man do I hate this movie!  I wish I had the time back that I wasted on watching it!  It is pointless (more so than the previous 2 entries) and insulting!  The only moment worthy of note is when Jason appears wearing his infamous hockey mask, but this does not by any means help the film.  The characters are stupid or boring and ugh just about everything else in the film is bad, most of it leaving a bad taste in my mouth!

I sighed with relief when Jason is hung (supposedly killing him) because than I knew it wouldn't be long before the movie came to an end.

One (intentional?) funny moment:  when Jason removes his mask, in order to reveal he was the one who raped the lead girl.  I laughed mainly because how pathetic the scene was.

258148,3,6300214311,"Did you ever wonder where Michael Myers had gone when you watched Halloween 3? Well, it appears that in 1982 Michael switched to the Friday 13th series instead. You see him standing behind the laundry, like he did in the first Halloween, you see his back and shoulders while he like a mysterious shade is watching people, and he is wearing similar clothes but has a new mask... But wait? It's not Michael, it's Jason! How could I confuse those guys? You can surely tell by the sound effects that it's Jason (or his mother).

CHI-chi-chi-chi-HA-ha-ha-ha

You know, that sound effect.

Seriously, the third Friday 13th movie seems to borrow quite heavily from the first two Halloween films. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. We have the relentless killer and the young people and they are put together. And like Halloween II this one begins about where the last one ended (or at least with news reports about bodies being found).

Still the movie *is* a Friday 13:th film. It's the camp by a lake. And being the third time, it almost makes it more exciting couse you know the kids are doomed (hmm, I wonder what this says about me?).

There is a new theme in this film, that sound very 80:ies. Almost like a video game. Quite short, but delivers what it promises but not much more. But it promises young people being killed by a mindless killer, and some 80:ies music, and that's good enough for me.",1107216000,4,1403,4.573705179282869

258150,5,6300214311,"Seems as though the fans of the whole Friday The 13th franchise can never get enough. In 1982, director Steve Miner brought us another sequel entitled, Friday The 13th Part 3, Steve Miner's second turn in directing a Friday The 13th film, his first being 1981's Friday The 13th Part 2.

  In this horrifying chapter, which starts off by showing what happened at the end of the second film, Jason (played by Richard Brooker) goes on to feed on more victims. Now, this sequel is sort of a continuation of the last film, just like Halloween 2 continued on from the first Halloween. First, Jason stumbles onto a married couple named Harold and Edna. Harold is an insecure man, who allows his b*tch of a wife order him around. Edna watches the news and find out about the murders from the second film (when this film is actually taking place only a day after the second film). At that moment, Harold comes running into the house to ""make a call to nature"". He finishes his bathroom business, but he hears a strange noise coming from outside the bathroom door. He opens the door and Jason knocks him off, where Jason then kills Edna.

  The next morning, a van pulls up into a nice looking neighborhood. Inside the van are Chris Higgins (played by Dana Kimmell), Debbie (played by Tracie Savage), Andy (Jeffrey Rogers), Shelley (played by Larry Zerner), and potheads, Chuck (played by David Katims) and Chili (played by Rachel Howard). They are on their way to Chris' family cabin in Camp Crystal Lake for the weekend. Right now, they're stopping to pick up Vera Sanchez (played by Catherine Parks), a girl who is going along as a date for Shelley. Shelley is very insecure about his looks and weight. In order for him to get people to like him, he has to scare the ever-loving sh*t out of them.

  The friends pull up to the cabin, where Chris is greeted by her boyfriend, Rick (played by Paul Kratka). After another Shelley-scaring-the-hell-out-everyone joke, Vera and Shelley drive off to the grocery store to get some food for the weekend, where they have a run-in with three bikers named, Ali (played by Nick Savage), Loco (played by Kevin O'Brien), and Fox (played by Gloria Charles). Shelley pays them back with revenge, but not before the bikers follow them back to the cabin, where they plan to set the kids' barn on fire. Before they even have a chance to burn the place, Jason takes care of business with the three of them.

  That night, Chris and Rick go for a long ride, just to catch up on things. Chris hasn't seen Rick for two years, since she hadn't gone back until now. Her reason: she was attacked by Jason and nearly killed by him. As she tells Rick the story of her terrifying ordeal, their car breaks down, `causing them to walk back to the cabin.

  At the cabin, Debbie and Andy have a little fun in the sac, until Debbie goes to get a shower. Andy goes for a beer, but is evilly greeted by Jason. Debbie finishes her shower and goes to bed, but she is then killed by Jason. Shelley again scares the crap out of Vera, this time where an old goalie mask. He goes off into the barn, all hurt from the way Vera yelled at him. But Shelley does not come back out; Jason comes out, wearing the goalie mask. He finds Vera and shows her how to play darts with just her left eye.

  Chuck and Chili also greet their demise. Chris and Rick return, but Rick is suddenly killed by Jason. Chris is all alone to battle Jason. She battles him in the barn. As she battles Jason, Ali suddenly appears to be alive. He tries to help Chris out, but Jason really finishes him off. As he kills Ali, Chris grabs an axe and jams it into Jason's forehead. He drops down to the ground and appears to be dead. It is then where Chris realizes that Jason is the one who attacked her all those years ago.

  Chris then goes off into a canoe and falls asleep. She wakes up and is relieved to find that morning has arrived. She finds Jason still alive and is running after her. As she tries to sail away with the canoe, she finds that she was only hallucinating. But at that moment, Mrs. Voorhees' dead body jumps up out of the lake and grabs Chris violently and pulls her underneath the water. But Chris is lucky to find that it was only dream. Chris is unlucky in the fact that she has gone completely mental from this whole ordeal.

  I told you twice before: no more camping until Jason is finished having his fun. But watch Friday The 13th Part 3, if you've enjoyed the first two films.",1106524800,3,4478,4.406553398058253

My favorite Friday sequels are part 3 and 6 because they have good characters and does not come across as a cheesy b-grade horror movie like the other 7 sequels.

258183,5,6300214311,"Now that we have been properly introduced to Jason, we can immediately start the movie with him appearing.  He first kills random people after the second ""counselor dispatch spree"" because he gets bored, and then our next group arrives.  They are no more cautious about Mr. Goalie than the other group from Part 2 was.  One by one, Jason gets them, including a group of gangsters who are there to seek revenge for an ugly confrontation in town that happened with the teenage counselors.  For some reason he leaves one unconcious (who has to say bye bye to his hand later) probably because he has no better weapon.  Eventually, he gets his hockey mask from Shelly, and then he mutilates everyone else except Dana Kimmell, who is literally the bravest girl you will ever see in these movies, except for maybe the physicic Tina in ""The New Blood"".  Going back to Kimmell, though, she stabs Jason, beats him down, and at the end gives him his sleepy medicine.  Of course, we all know that sleepy potion is only for a while.

Some of the best, yet scary scenes in here are where Rick's face is squeezed out and where Jason's mask is taken off, revealing to Dana Kimmell that Jason is the person who chased her through the woods some time ago.  The only question is, why did he change his looks from long hair to bald?

258187,4,6300214311,"Out of all the Friday movies, I find the characters in this one to be the most likable.  That's really important because when it comes to a slasher film, you have to actually care if these people live or die, and this one succeeds better in that regard than just about any other slasher I've seen.  Oh, they're the usual bunch of teenagers, smoking dope and having sex, but they each have a unique personality and are very sympathetic.  Also, some of the scenes are actually kind of ""scary"", especially the one where the hippie guy goes into the basement to turn the electricity back on.  Then there's the great ""disco"" theme music, and all the goofy 3-D shots - the film was shown in 3-D in theaters, but the DVD is NOT in 3-D - but you still get all sorts of things thrust in the direction of the camera that were supposed to jump out at you when it was in 3-D.  Jason is especially good in this one, like some crazed maniac, just like he's supposed to be.

The picture quality is exceptionally good, the film looks like it could have been made last year.  The sound quality also seems a bit better than on the first two movies.  On those movies, the sound seemed quite thin, on this one it's more full and rich.  Certainly no Dolby 5.1, but for a mono track it's quite satisfying.

Overall, if you like slashers from the '80s, this is about as good as it gets.  I would have given it 5 stars but it goes too light on the T&A.  Really odd considering the movie teases us with a couple of scenes, but don't blink or you'll miss what little there is to see.

258190,3,6300214311,"Some have called ""Part 3"" one of the best of the ""Friday The 13th""s, but personally it was not a favorite.  I would place it above only ""Jason X"".  That's not to say I disliked it; I enjoyed it quite a lot, but it doesn't come close to some of the other ""Friday's that make my 'best-of' list.  It's probably the least distinguished and least distinct of its series, but it succeeds in spite of itself.  There are some interesting ideas (that could have been fleshed out more), but also some seeming contradictions in the time scale.  There are some likable characters (though not to the level of ""Part 2""'s overall cast) and some less likable ones.  The girls are very pretty.

  In the last 20 minutes or so, the quality of the film picks up sharply.  Prevoiusly a good watch, it suddenly starts to attain the superior feel and spirit of its two predecessors, almost but not quite making it to their level, albeit a little late.

  Obviously much of the appeal of the original theatrical release was its 3-D nature, but unfortunately it is not available over here in that format, despite the capacity of DVD to support it, nor does it look like it'll get a domestic release in 3D anytime soon.  In that case I wish they'd re-release it theatrically, because even though its not one of the best Fridays, I'd still love a chance to give the 3D version a chance.  As it is, the non-3D disc available still manages to be a worthy part of the saga, though not a high point.",1096502400,,1469,4.42910447761194
258231,3,6300214311,"Whew! Paramount wasn't wasting any time making sequels for this series! Part 3 as released just one year after part 2 (same period of time between the original and the sequel) but I must admit, this time there were some upgrades. First off, I must remark that this movie was originally called Friday The 13th Part 3: 3-D because it was presented in theatres in 3-D, which explains many of the odd focuses on objects pointed at the screen.

 The third movie decides that maybe rebuilding the camp again is just a little too far feched for now, so instead we get a group of young adults (which is funny because the hippy couple looks like they're in their forties and the youngest looking couple seems very casual with the fact that they're having a baby) going to a cabin for the weekend on Crystal Lake. Jason's back in this film and this time he gets to finally get his hands on the famous hockey mask that will stay with him as his signature for future films. This cast is a little more tight knit than the others in that they all kinda stick together. Eventually Jason makes his way through all of the characters until there's only one left standing, Chris (female). Jason's stronger this time around and it's he's a lot more convincingly strong than his Part 2 version (the hockey mask also adds to this drastically).

 This installment was actually much better than the criticism it recieves. I know, it's annoying to see all the wierd 3-D shots and at times it can take focus away from the action, but remember that they didn't film it for the purpose of 2-D home viewing. The characters are more developed in this film than any other, the writer this time around allowed us to actually connect with most characters before we violently take them out. The gore is getting better, complete with the scene where Andy is cut in half! Chris is a whiney and traumatised girl, even before enduring a showdown with Jason, but it's mostly from her fears of encountering Jason in the past (we get a brief flashback sequence). Jason is also bigger, badder, and stronger, now taking a fifteen foot drop onto a noose and getting up almost immediately to fight. What I liked most about this film was that it introduced and layed the groundwork for the Jason that we see in every other movie from here on.

 The DVD is still staying standard, nothing too special going on here but still an improvement from the SLP grainy versions for rent on VHS. The video is clean (almost too clean when you see the famous eye-popping scene) and the audio is crisp and clear (and still in 2.0). I must admit that although I don't think there's an ""uncut"" version of this either, I am disappointed in the lack of a 3-D option (C'mon, Shrek 3-D is only 15 mins and sold a million copies!). Deleted scenes or an ""uncut"" would also be cool to see as the new degree of violence in this movie makes me wonder what the MPAA didn't approve.

 I would give the same advice to this installment as I did to Part 2, which depends on the type of viewer you are. If you are an avid Jason fan, pick it up, it won't let you down (too much). As far as a 3-D version, the boxed set won't have it and this version doesn't either (maybe in the future, but don't hold your breath, Paramount is making it pretty clear that since Jason is a New Line franchise now that it isn't all that focused on him). If you're just a horror fan, you may want to watch it first. Not necessarily in need of its own disc but may not be a reason to go for the boxed set, either.",1091664000,,3515,4.372128637059724
258232,2,6300214311,"After watching the 3rd installment in the ""Friday the 13th"" series, after the first 2, my decided opinion was that the series isn't all it's cranked up to be. And after watching all the others, my opinion is still the same. ""Friday the 13th Part 3"", differs from the last two, becuase it's not about a group of counsleours preparing a summer-camp. This time, the story revolves around a group of kids, somewhere in thier young 20's, that are staying in a couple cabins, just for a good time. And Jason kills all of them, except a level-headed and responsible girl. The girl, Chris, actually has a past with Jason. She was sitting in the woods one night when she was little, and saw a very, very ugly man, who scared her. And it was Jason,which she confirms when his mask comes off later in the movie. Another interesting thing about Chris is that she goes crazy in the end after her hellish expierence (very Sally Hardesty); which makes me wonder why this never happend to any other ""last girl"" in the series. Anyway, part 3 is rather tired, and very quick. It somehow seems bored with itself, and goes by in a second. Chris is kind of boring as the survivor. And the whole 3-D gimmick, which was lame to begin with, doesn't show up too well on VHS's. I was expecting this one to be good, because of the reviews, and the neat box-art. But, as aforementioned, I was wondering what all the fuss was about after seeing it. And this goes for the entire series.

First of all, this movie is okay in its sense to add a little suspense into the movie, but the act gets old quick when Jason (Richard Brooker) is everywhere, yet he rarely pops out to kill someone. It's just like a movie from the ""Halloween"" series, just much, much cheesier and duller. The acting, unlike the first two installments, is a bad mix. I could never get over the casting either. In this movie, there is a group of six (...)driven college aged students who are staying at a cabin on the lake in the woods. Then there are these two people who to be about 35 years old who consistantly smoke weed and talk like hippies (...). To add more deaths, the writers decided to throw in dead meat, which turned out to be suprisingly the most interesting characters of the whole movie. They were three bikers, with Gloria Fox as my favorite playing the tough-girl Fox.

First, let me say I was bored half way through the movie. The slasher scenes are poor, blood effects dismal, and the girls. . . Well, certainly not enough is shown to even make it the slight bit interesting.
The plot is simple. A bunch of teens and what looks to be like a guy in his late 20's goes to where 'Camp Blood' used to be. Of course, 'yours truly', (Jason), is thee, ensuring they have a weekend  to die for, no pun intended.
The plot is weak, because NO one seems to fight back decently. I mean, yes, some get some hits on him, but it's no where to the point where they 'have a chance'.
If I was reviewing this movie the year it came out, the rating might have been higher. But in this day and age, this movie, with the poor effects, is now a 'classic'. It's only worth watching when you're bored, or if you're a die-hard fan of the series.

258272,3,6300214311,"Since I watched ""Freddy vs. Jason"", I've suddenly have become a Jason fan. I bought this entry, ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" and was bit nick picky on the overall flaws this film has.
What's not to say about a Jason movie? Honestly, the films has been called terrible. I could somewhat understand that. This movie has the same old plot device with the typical stupid hormoned counselors who get hacked up one by one by Jason. Another problem is, along with bad acting, is the somewhat lack of screen time for Jason. I just hate watching the characters taking the whole movie that deserves to Jason. Every time Jason kills somebody, the camera hardly shows Jason's appearance. Just a quick killing. Why are the filmmakers hiding Jason's identity? We all know Jason is doing the killings! It's not like someone else is doing the murders. Just cut out the surprises!
Despite all that, a good thing about this movie is that Jason finally gets his iconic hockey mask. Beats the heck out of that stupid potato sack he wore in ""Part 2."" There's also a good amount of frights and scares. It replaces some of the minimal amount of gore this film has.
It's a good and bad slasher flick . It's better then most ""Friday"" entries. That's not saying much. I reccommend ""Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives."" It's the best ""Friday.""",1074816000,,1313,4.591489361702128
258273,5,6300214311,"Jason Voorhees has become the most beloved of Hollywood's strong, silent type. Part 3 is a step above Parts 1 & 2. Although the first two films definately had their moments, Part 3 is where the famous 'Jasonesque' takes root and conquers America. Not only is Jason finally the way we want him to be, Part 3 also included a complex script with side stories and deeper character development. If you really analyze this film, you will see that not only does it have all the makings of an Acadamy Award, it is a brilliant tribute to directing. Let me explain.......
This film is most infamous because Jason finally gets his hockey mask. He takes it off his victim (he also takes the speargun). The victim in question is a fat, pathetic white kid with a big afro. He is always pulling practical jokes, not to scare or hurt, but for attention. His friend asks him why he continues with his hijinks. Poeticly, he answers ""I'd rather be a loser than nothing at all'. How many here reading this right now have not told themselves the same thing? Everyone, all together, group hug.
Even though this movie is early 80's it is far ahead of its time in social views. For the first time in a movie, a Latino / Hispanic American is represented in the form of a teenage girl. The story gives subtle yet obvious clues into her life. She has an argument with her 'mama' before heading out to the farm. Her mother doesn't want her hanging around her 'white hoodlum devil' friends. ""We don't take food stamps here!"" is a phrase I'm sure she's heard many times, but our fat loser saves the day with cash, but the wallet causes a whole other problem......
The beautiful thing about this movie is that it breaks the social and racial barriers. A biker gang (consisting of course of three people) is post-racial. We have a white guy, a black guy, and a Spanish woman. See how the three of them get along as equals. Harmony for all, that is the real message of Friday the 13th Part 3.
And lastly we have a tribute to our noble past, the 1960's. Two middle aged burnouts who have nothing to do with the story and who have nothing to contribute to the plot, simply become fodder for the machette. This is the director telling us that the glory days of drug abuse is over. Clean bodies and minds will lead us through the 80's, 90's and into the millenium. Drug users have no place in society's future and thank God it worked out that way.
With plenty of action (tubby running over motorcycles with a VW Beetle to defend the honor of his hot tamale love interest) and suspense (will Jason survive a hanging and axe to the head?) to drama (who could have guessed the biker was alive in the barn the whole time? Swing that chain!) and finally the conclusion of this exciting and marvellous film. Part 4 only continued in the fine tradition of high quality film making.",1074124800,,2837,4.447216890595009
258274,5,6300214311,"Okay, I'm sick of people saying that ""Friday The 13th"" is just a rip-off of ""Halloween"".  That's ridiculous.  Jason Voorhies is a much better horror character than Michael Meyers could ever hope to be (call me crazy, but I didn't think that Meyers was scary at all).  That being said, now let me discuss this excellent movie.
Originally seen in 3D when it hit the theaters in 1982, ""Friday The 13th Part 3"" is possibly the best movie in the whole series (and it's definitely the most gruesome).  The plot isn't exactly monumental, but who cares about the plot when you have such eerie, wicked murder scenes?
Another reason I love this movie is the girls.  Dana Kimmell and Tracie Savage are two of the most beautiful female specimens that I've ever laid eyes on (Savage looks like a goddess in that blue bikini)!  Anyway, my hormones notwithstanding, the acting is actually not that bad.  Kimmell does by far the best acting job in the film, and she might just be the greatest heroine in the whole series.  The rest of the actors all do their best but they're nowhere near as good.
This movie stands out among the others for two reasons.  First, it's the first one where Jason gets his infamous hockey mask (from one of his victims, no less).  And second, the murder scenes are much more graphic and sickening than in the first two (check out the eyeball-popping scene, among others).  Jason seems to be more confident than he had been before and would be since.
This movie is DEFINITELY worth owning if you're a hardcore horror fan, like me.  You won't be disappointed.  Just make sure that you never go into the woods at night...",1073779200,3,1631,4.582758620689655

258294,4,6300214311,"First let me say this film is very nostalgic to me. I was fortunate enough to see it in its original theatrical 3-D release. I remember the credits coming out at you in 3-D. As a kid, It was a thrill for me, scary and exciting. Part 3 is my favorite film out of  11 Jason films. I had read this was the most profitable 3-D theatrical release ever. That may have changed with the new onslaught of 3-D movies. While we are at it, My Bloody Valentine 3D was loads of fun!
I almost fell out of my chair when I read this Friday the 13th was being released as a special version. I went out immediately and bought it. I must say this DVD must be making some money because many stores had sold out of it, but had plenty of the other 2 special releases in stock. I finally snagged the last copy from Best Buy.
My favorite part of the film was the 3-D opening credits. I am even one of those rare birds that dig the theme song. I even own the theme song. It was written by Harry Manfredini under the name of Hot Ice.
I am really let down by the opening credits not being in 3-D. Why? I cannot understand this glaring omission. I skimmed through the movie to see how effective the 3-D effects were.
Here is a rundown of some of the effects (but not all of them):

The first noticeable effect was the laundry pole being handled by Harold. It literally came out right in front of my face. Excellent.

The snake in the rabbit cage. Not so good. I saw 2 snakes. (there should only be one)

Passing the joint in the van: again I saw double vision here. Not so good.

The bum holding the eyeball up to the camera. This time it worked excellent.

Lifting the hay into the barn and the hay swaying back and forth on the rope was good. Again this worked great. The depth was excellent, almost dizzying.

The fist through the car glass. Not so good.

The yo-yo scene: the first part wasn't working but the last few swings really did came straight out of the screen.

The gas siphon scene seemed to have perfect clarity and amazing depth. The whole film should have looked like this.

The two thugs getting a pitchfork in the barn. Only average here. Could have been better. But the pitchfork handle did come out of the screen.

The juggling scene. It was effective. Not bad but not great. The room depth was good here.

Kris telling about her encounter with Jason. Her head seemed to float around while the story played in the background behind her. This was good. I don't even remember this scene being in 3-D.

The harpoon in the eye scene did not seem to work to well for me. I tried it several times. This was suppose to be the highlight effect of the film. It just happened so fast.

The popcorn worked. I think it would work better on a bigger screen.

The hippy getting electrocuted; the sparks flew out of the screen, very cool.

Effects that did not work. The female hippy with the fire poker through her. And the boy doing the hand stand and getting a machete in his hoo hoo, neither of these had much effect.

The eyeball popping out of the head. This was funny, because when the eyeball pops out, you can hear a horn beep. Like a horn at the end of a joke by Groucho Marx. I don't remember the horn noise LOL. Oh and yes the eyeball scene worked very well.

Other minor effects: Jason throws a knife at Chris. Jason plummets through the front porch and grabs at Kris.

Jason being hung. This worked well as far as the depth. The rope seemed to be on the outside of the screen.

Jason getting the meat cleaver in the head and putting his hands out to the camera. Worked excellent, very exciting!

All in all it is kind of a headache watching this thing. But I thought the sound was of a much better quality than the earlier Friday Part 3 DVD I have. I really didn't get the ending where Jason's mother pops up out of the water, but hey what part of the movie is realistic anyway? I am glad to have this. Maybe we will get a better version with the opening credits.",1059523200,,3954,4.210596026490066

The 3-D however turned the film into something special. It still is the best 3-D I have ever seen on screen and would love to be able to recapture that magic on DVD if at all possible. Many sequences in the film were enhanced by the inclusion of this process, most notably: the eye launching, the spear gun, and even the guys fist smashing through the VW window. Without the 3-D the movie is simply lacking what made it almost great. If you see it flat it is three stars, in 3-D, five.",1057017600,,657,4.222222222222222

I think the only thing new about this, is the killings, and this is the first time we get to see Jason sporting his classic hockey mask, and instead just a batch of teens, its also a biker gang that Jason polishes off.
Of course, in every F13 movie, the teens always ignore all news headlines about the murders that happen at Camp Crystal Lake, and they decide to go there to have some high hormone sexual fun. What turns about to be fun turns about to be a painful worst nightmare. Jason kills each teen in a unique way and leaves them dangling around to surprise the next victim he's about to kill.

The acting is as crummy as crummy can be, but this installment offers the goods: good looking babes who get down and dirty, and some great blood and gore effects.  This may feature some of the most brutal killings in the series until Jason Goes to Hell came along, but this installment is pivotal for one reason: Jason finally ditches his potato sack and dons the trademark hockey mask.

When I found out it was on DVD I was pleased and quickly purchased it. I found watching now that I'm in my twenties it is still a great horror/slasher film,it didn't give me nightmares like when I was a kid but it certainly will make you jump at scenes. This movie is about a group of teenagers that take a weekend and visit a friends cabin near Camp Crystal Lake. The main character has alreadly encountered Jason before when she ran away from home and went to the woods. I like the concept of mystery that she saw Jason but didn't know about the murders at Camp Crystal,and the fact that her friends don't realize either. Friday The 13th 3 uses the same winning formula as other classic 80's slashers,scary music(composed by Harry Manfredini) that did the original score,same atmosphere(the woods,lake,barn)and by far the best and most brutal deaths of the franchise,including a guy walking on his hands and getting split in half, and a harpoon in the eye(just to name a few). This is a classic and a collector for Friday The 13th fans,Jason finally ditches the .... ku klux klan sheet,and gets his famous hockey mask 1)BRILLANT SCORE BY HARRY MANFREDINI FROM ORIGINAL FRIDAY THE 13TH,2)DECENT ACTING(WAY BETTER THEN 2,4 AND THE ...

Rich girl Chris (Dana Kimmell) with prankster Shelly (Larry Zerner), Andy (Jeffery Rogers), Chuck (David Katims), Vera (Catherine Parks), Debbie (Tracie Savage) and Chili (Rachel Howard) are having a sexual holiday at a cottage by the lake called Higgins Haven. Chris unfortunately remembers two years ago that she was attacked by Jason Voorhees but luckily survived and has now returned back to the place to get rid of her bad memories, however the vicious maniac wants blood including hers.

A Gory and solid entry of the way too cool Friday The 13th franchise! This is the movie that finally gave Jason a mask and it's his trademark hockey mask that established him. Steve Miner who directed part 2 does a superb job on this entry with scares, shocks, graphic gore like a guy getting his head crushed until his eye pops out, and of course decent acting. I think this one really brings the series growing high and made a big enough fortune in August 13 of 1982 and did a nice job of giving us Jason in his hockeymask and the ending is quite scary as well.

This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with only one extra which is a theatrical trailer and of course for the first time in 27 years the original 3D version of the film complete with two pairs of 3D glasses and the 2D version.",1048896000,,1428,4.57421875

Of course there is the obligatory killing and naked women running around, but I think the best part of this film is the 3-D effects that were used back in the early 80's when 3-D movies were popular. Even though the film technically isn't in 3-D anymore, the gags used to make the 3-D effect are hilarious. The humor alone makes this film worth seeing.

Camp Crystal Lake, an area stretching just over four square miles, had been the sight of eight grotesque murders, with the media speculating over rumors of mutilations and cannibalism that had followed in suite. Still, and ending had been achieved. As is the case with many a primal killing machine, however, one blow is often not enough to do the deed - especially if that blow is to the lower neck on the back of the aggressor - and Jason was left with the ability to breath, thereby allowing him to heal and start again. Enter a van loaded with seven occupants on their way to a secluded home just outside of Crystal Lake, lead by a former introductee to Mr. Vorhees scarred by the run-in and who wants to confront and vanquish those demons. Well, her friends are there for her like good friends should be, and they opt to journey into the seclued home where the deed took place to have fun/ be there for her. On the way there they are confronted by an elderly gentlemen that tells them, amidst his insane rambling, that they are all in peril and to flee, but this is a time for fun and sun so they ignore this herald and continue on with their troubled colleague. Yes, her friends are there for her, until the would-be fun turns into a nightmare and then the dying times begin.
While showing some signs of aging in the world of more modern effectual bliss, the movie still has some strong points in the ways of slasher flicks and is the portion of the Friday the 13th legacy that introduced a icon into the fold. That's because it was here, amidst the suffering introduced to many a victim, that the persona of Jason was adopted and his mask was found. Still, that's only one of the points I liked about the movie. Personally, I enjoy the drawn out stalking that takes place as Jason plays cat-and-mouse in those early days, letting the audience familiarize themselves with his potential victims before the killing begins. This lets personalities develop amongst the troops, showcasing two chronically abusive merrymen as they seek out high after high, a local countryboy, the damaged damsel, the two lovers that are expecting, the jerk/prankster, and the somewhat stuck-up blind date as they wander toward that machete-toting brick wall. Combine this with the fact that there are plenty of other disposable portions of suffering to pad the scenes, letting the mind do a little shopping and follow a few bikers into the realms of attitude correction, and you have yourself a funderland of experiences.
If you've seen other Friday the 13ths and you are looking for some of the more serious slasher times, then this is one of introduction points. The effects aren't the best here and the storyline does have its holes, but the characters tend to find ways to overcome that and the ending chase and the damage that ensues in the end more than make up for it. Its like a fun-loving romp, with scissors!",1044662400,16,3072,4.597449908925319

He's also now completely bald, he seems to have lost all of his hair in that half hour time frame.  The disco theme is pretty catchy, and the 3D thing looks quite dumb.  It would be nice if the dvd came with glasses and the film was in 3D.  When the van full of victims pulls up(as it always seems to in these the beginning of these films.  They might as well have an announcer say, ""Lets meet our victims, ladies and gentlemen""), you will identify almost immediately who the lucky one is who'll survive.  That point is pounded home even more when she refuses the advances of her old boyfriend.  And of course, as you probably already know, Jason gets his hands on that hockey mask in this one, and he must love it, coz he's never without it again.  In fact, he manages to get it back after losing it a few times, and even gets a brand new one in 8.  No different than the rest, but I have to admit that this one has what I feel to be the creepiest moment in the series.

This was the one where Jason finally gets his hockey mask. After surviving the events of Part 2, Jason goes to a near by small store and kills a couple.

This time he goes after the couple Chris Higgins and Rick, a jokester named Shelly, two girls, two pot smokers, and three bike gangsters. Most of the murders took place in the barn. Even though the climactic chase scene was fairly good, the ending was horrible. In Chris' dream, Jason is alive again with his mask off and runs to out of the barn. At that same time, Mrs. Voorhees pulls Chris under water. How is that possible. Chris didn't even know about Mrs. Voorhees. Not being at Camp Crystal Lake hurt this film.

258400,5,6300214311,"You can tell by the cover art alone that it was filmed in 3D. It's too bad that if you were not able to see it originally in the theaters in 1982, then you'll probably never see the 3D version. I am among the unlucky in this respect.
At least Part 3 tries to be a little better than the previous two. In this one, they've tried a little character development as apposed to the previous installments in which they just lined up horney teenagers to be killed off. On the sake of sounding like I'm trying to draw much more out of the film than there actually was, I'll say that it seemed that they managed to bring in characters that showed the wide scope of humanity: There's an aspiring actor with incredibly low self esteem, an attack victim, pot users, and a misfit biker gang.
Incidentally, even though they tried character development, no matter how diverse the characters, I never said that I thought they succeeded.
The uses of the 3D effects throughout the movie are sporadic, and if you don't pay attention, you'll miss one. Of course, the underlying fact is that it IS a slasher film and, eventually, it starts acting like one. It seems that after all of the fun--and as the movie picks up its momentum--the 3D effects seem to be disregarded. I think the last effect is the eye popping out at the camera trick right before the traditional ""girl discovering all of the dead bodies"" routine. Aside from that, I'd have to agree with some that it seems that entire scenes were created and set up just to have a 3D effect in it. The Yo-Yo scene is a good example.
Is it me or is the heroine during the chase sequence act a little too melodramatic? For example, when she attacks Jason with the ax and he stops for a moment then continues to peruse her, she starts walking backwards, shaking her head and screaming, ""NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!"" over and over with a crazed look in her eye. Like the director deliberately gave her too much coffee before the shoot.
Then of course there's the dream sequence that makes you think, ""been there and done that"". Afterwards she's seen being walked out of one of the cabins by a police officer and escorted into the back of the squad car. I guess she had too much coffee before that scene too, as this is where she starts throwing a fit in the back of vehicle. That makes ME think, ""All right, THAT'S never happened in a Friday the 13th movie before . . .""
Overall, with the 3D effects scenes aside, I think that this is one of the better F13 films that were produced.",1031097600,2,2504,4.375536480686695

Ranking in #1 as my favorite Friday flick, Jason here closes in on his first hockey mask, slashing away at some of the series' most colorful characters, including the big-wigged, nerdy, overweight, ghastly-looking Shelly, a biker group (Ali,Loco,Fox), the dorky Chris Higgins love interest Rick, and Chris herself, played by Dana Kimmell, who much like Alice at the beginning of Part 2, is haunted by horrific memories. Chris had been attacked by a mysterious man in the woods, who ofcourse is the legend himself... Jason Voorhees.
Throughout the film we get eye-spearing, throat-slitting, body-halving, and head-crushing to the moment of eye-popping.
Some of the best death scenes in slasher history! Jason ofcourse gets the hockey mask from Shelly, and would find it a suitable disguise for his entire horror career.
 The beginning credits of this film are absolutely fun, just like the first two slash-fests. However, Harry Manfredini puts a new twist to the score, which is quality horror-stuff! Director Steve Miner, out-does himself with his second run at the helm of the Friday series. The woodsy settings of these films are apart of the formula that has made these movies classics.

Parts 2, 3 & 4 gave us the birthing of a supernatural serial killer, and make up the first of the three.  Michael Myers may have laid down the rules for the genre, but Jason Voorhees became its icon.  This chapter, as the middle of any trilogy should, had a nerve-drilling ending that left the hero in the most uncertain position.  But Jason was more than a hero; he was an anti-hero.  That meant he was a mystery, a wild card.  Every time he got killed, throughout the series, he came back more invulnerable.  In part 1, we were told about a death curse on Crystal Lake.  Curses tend to get worse the more one tried to interfere with them.  They adapted to each new threat. This chapter began only a few hours after part 2, which left Jason suffering from a machete wound.  Needing to heal and hide from a massive manhunt, he found an apparently abandoned barn behind an old lake house.  The location was familiar to him, though.  One year before, he assaulted a young girl there.  She too has returned to that place to heal.  He acts like a trapdoor spider, hiding in the barn, killing one poor unsuspecting soul at a time.  Before the end of the night, he will be stabbed, hanged, and the victim of a vicious axe to the head. This is not Jason at his most powerful.  But every time he gets killed he comes back stronger.

Also the pot head couple really brings in a couple of laughs just like the couple that comes out in the begining of the movie fighting. This movie is really a great movie to see.,1019606400,2,345,4.088235294117647

258412,2,6300214311,"""Why do they keep going back?!"" you say.  ""Why do we keep building million dollar homes in earthquake prone southern California?"".  We just do.  The bigger question is ""If you're the police and a woman is attacked and you don't find her killer, wouldn't you kinda let people know or something?""  Not at Crystal Lake.  And so begins the third chapter of the little series that could.  Paramedics haul off Ginny (Part 2) and Jason pulls the machete from his shoulder and scurries away for more carnage.
This is my least favorite in terms of the ""Why?"" factor.  Why is one of the girls pregnant?  Wait.  I know WHY she's pregnant; it just makes the filmmakers seem that much more vulgar when she is killed.  Why, in the flashback scene, is Jason wearing his current clothes even though the flashback was several years ago and he didn't get the black jumpsuit until the beginning of this movie?  Why does Jason apparently shave his head between Part 2 (which happens the night before) and Part 3?  Why would you spend money on an expensive 3-D process and then leave the wires that control the snake, knife, eyeball, and harpoon visible?  Wouldn't it be Saturday?
Other than that, it's okay.  What Steve Miner misses in continuity he makes up for during the chase scenes which are some of the best in the series.
My biggest complaint is the complaint that I have of all the DVDs.  Few extras and the cut print.  This is particularly irritating this time out because of the alternate ending.  In the alternate ending Chris wakes up in the canoe the next morning and goes back to the cabin.

Lots of gory deaths: Jason squeezes a guy's head with his bare hands and the guy's eyeball pops out (Shoots directly at the screen), A woman gets skewered by a red hot fireplace polker, a kid has his throat slashed, a biker is impaled by a pitchfork, a girl gets a harpoon shot into her eye (my favorite), another girl on a hammock gets knifed from underneath through her chest (excellent effect), and a person walking on his hands is split from his crotch to his head. And that's not the half of it... These flicks make Nightmare on Elm St. and the Evil Dead look like Sesame Street. Great stuff.",1012176000,2,821,4.235668789808917
258414,5,6300214311,"THe Final CHapter is my favorite Friday but Part 3 is great in its own way. THis film picks off where Part 2 left off. Jason has just finished off a bunch of kids at Crystal Lake and now he's laying low in a barn owned by a redneck and his hag wife. Jason kills them and then moves to another barn where a bunch of kids have decided to spend their weekend. This group is probably the best of the Friday gangs. There are some memorable characters here, the best one is Shelly a fat white guy with an Afro! He claims to be an actor and he carries a little suitcase with his acting makeup in it, and he's always playing tricks on the others. The group also includes two nymphos and two potheads. Plus the heroine of the film Chris(yummy Dana Kimmell) and her hard-luck boyfriend Rick. This film was originally shown in theatres in 3-D but that effect is missing on the video and DVD. Still the movie is a terrific entry into the Friday series. Part 3 has great atmosphere, you really feel like you're out in the country. You also feel how menacing it gets at night out in the woods! THe kills here are really good and original. The 3-D effect was really important for two kills. When Jason kills Vera with the speargun to the eye, in 3-D you really see the spear coming at you! Also when Jason crushes Rick's head with his hands you actually see Rick's eye come out of the screen right into your face! Too bad you can't duplicate that effect on DVD or video. But the movie is good regardless. The acting is ok but the guy who plays Jason is really good. This Jason is probably one of the scariest. His makeup is grotesque, and he's huge, bald, with a nasty attitude! This movie is also important because this is the movie where Jason first wears his hockey mask, which he takes from Shelly, after slitting his throat of course. The DVD doesn't do this movie justice. There is a lot of delted footage that isn't even included as an extra. But don't let that stop you from renting and enjoying this classic.",1006992000,6,2002,4.298941798941799
258437,5,6300214311,"My remarks toward this picture
You would think that by now Camp Crystal Lake would have forever been shuttered for vacationers worldwide, and that there would have been an FBI task force all throughout the camp's grounds in search of the killer causing all these deaths, but not here. Logical sense is nowhere to be found here, for here is where the series begins to go downhill in deliberation that it was once one to have initially been taken seriously. (Serious enough, anyway.) The undistinguishing nature of Jason's victims permits consistency to fall by the wayside, thereby indicating the film's status as little more than a senseless thrill-machine.
Obviously, it isn't really going to appeal to those outside of the genre. But to those who like things to be shockingly repellent, there are some really intense death sequences here, such as the one where Andy, a sex-crazed teenager who has just impregnated his girlfriend not too long ago, his body is split in half lengthwise while walking on his hands. And then there's Rick, the leading character's wannabe manly but rather wimpy-looking boyfriend, whose eyeballs actually pop out of their sockets immediately after his head is crushed by Jason's awesome force.
Despite of what little subplot there was (something that is easily noticed from what little synopsis there was describing the film in the back of the case), what little intelligence there was put into the script and what little effort there was put into the performances, for the majority of it was ever so laughable (hell, maybe these actors were really trying they were that bad, but for all I know they could've been bums freshly picked out of the streets), it is one that manages to be both fun in nature and mean-spirited. It's an interesting little scare-fest that not only grossed out a greater audience when it was released in theaters than the last two for the usage of three-dimensional graphics, but somehow stood as my fondest. Perhaps because this is the one where Jason departs from that ludicrous-looking bag of his which rather looked like some giant old sock with a hole that permitted him to see through one eye, and dons the infamous hockey mask, which, being a highly significant factor, presented a strong visual imagery of him, as the director had when he first introduced Jason as a child in present time at the end of the original. Also, perhaps because it's more conceptive with regards to the creative events and for the fact that acclaimed director Steve Miner injects it with a lot more atmosphere and tension. (I completely admire his cunning style of filmmaking toward depictions of menacing lurking presence that could merely be from whom else but his favorite creation? I love the way he crafts it all together. He really knows how to pull us into the screen.)
Although the characters in the films aren't always that appealing for the individuals in whom they are in general, these ""wild bunch"", as they were known to be, that were featured in this one were quite hysterical and classical. You, in fact, almost don't want to see them getting hacked apart, for the filmmakers manage to have us sympathize for a number of them; some of whom struggle with their self-image, while others strive to move on with their lives and not let the past hinder with them-dark times that have since haunted them.
As a film which thinks it departs from provoking laughter, it fails. No doubt about it. But as a Friday the 13th film, it's purely and simply well-crafted from beginning-to-end; it's a perfect depiction of a summer camp trip gone wrong, for the campers, as day grew weary and the meteorological conditions, including temperature, precipitation and wind, prevailed, ultimately find themselves trapped in a campground where they are rendered helpless and have no choice but to witness what becomes of those who fall victim to their stalker's rampage, until there was only one left who had to face all this horror on hers (or his) own. As the film tightened to its climax and the lone survivor was left alone with what has created havoc of her (or his) life, I was completely frozen with fear, and still, regardless of how many times I watch the film-for I have well over twenty-remain to be as I begin to perceive of the film's gradual change of climate and signs that the trip isn't the serene one it is made out to be, for they never are. Are they?",1005955200,4,4402,4.801054018445323
258438,5,6300214311,"Friday the !3th part 3 is easily the best film in the series. It is fast paced, especially with the chase scene at the end where Jason pursues Chris through the cottage and barn. There are twelve murders or so in this picture, all attributed to Jason: a woman is lying on a hammock and a knife goes through her throat, a man is walking on his hands and gets split in half by Jason's machete and then is later wrapped around a rafter. I just read a review about this picture saying that Jason was not the killer in the original Friday the 13th that Mrs Voorhees was. But I think it was both of them. For starters, when Annie,a camp counsellor gets a ride from probably Mrs Voorhees,realises her ride goes past a turnoff to Camp Crystal Lake and keeps going, she jumps from the car and runs into the forest. There she runs into a man(if you look closely you will see it is a man and not a woman) who slits her throat. Later, towards the end of the film, Jason throws the body of a camp counsellor through a window, and it is not til later that Mrs Voorhees turns up in her Jeep, meaning that Jason probably did a couple of the murders. Friday the 13th Part 3 is easily my most favourite horror movie of all time.",1005696000,4,1210,4.1752136752136755

258440,4,6300214311,"Extreme vicious attacks on unsuspecting campers makes Friday 3 one of the better movies in this series. ( 3rd best over all, behind part 7 & 6.)
This movie represents Jason's first mask and probably the first time he really dies before becoming a walking killing zombie.
Have you noticed in early friday movies Jason actual runs after people but as the movies go up in numbers he walks real slow.
( Probably one of the few things the producers of the series has done right throughout the movies.)
Anyway, this movie is really enjoyable and has lots of gore and violence.
The movie picks up right after part 2.
You can even notice when Jason changed from his hillbilly suit from part 2 in the opening scenes of the movie.
All in all for a movie made in 1983, it was pretty good and much more entertaining than others such as part I,II,V,VIII, and the worst of all part 9 ( Jason Goes To Hell ).
In part 3 the ending is very good as well ( especially when compared to others like part VIII ).

series' grandly under-whelming tradition of presenting to it's diehard fans
cerebrally devoid stereotypical victims, your usual quota of naive inexperienced
teens coupling unconvincing before the body harvest, massive slaughter brought
to you with NO forethought or intent behind it, mandatory horrifying romantic
subplots in the guise of entertainment, by-the numbers storytelling, and bombastically
moronic massive butchery that made the Vietnam War appear to be a High-School
play by comparison.
This time the story arc changes to Jason Stalks on Farm. Eeh Ie Eehe Ie Oh!!
Isn't that quaintly adorable. Jason gets to decimate the farmers using the same
simplistic techniques he practiced fluidly on the previous movie. During this
""sensitively portrayed moral parable"" Jason goes on self-discovery walk where
he kills, kills, kills, and makes hostile conversation with his arsenal. Though
the thought of something original penetrating the strictly moronic fabric of
this film eludes me yet again. The film ""does"" have it's high points: Jason's
hockey mask does make it's first series appearance in this film, Jason finally
begins to use projectile weapons, he kills an extremely annoying hypochondriac
You finally get to see Jason's true face, and not every character this time
is a sex-craved Porky's reject.
Now matter how many times I see this or any other Friday film, the supposed
""plot"" of zombitized mental reject summarily executing everyone in sight somehow doesn't ever impress me. If the thought of watching a low budgeted murder set piece film with masked decomposing anti-hero running amok sounds appetizing.

Meanwhile a group of teens arrive for a weekend of fun at Crystal Lake, obviously no one in the group has been watching television, or listening to the radio, and seen or heard the news reports about the mass murder that has just occured there and the warnings that the suspect(s) may still be in the area.  Soon enough night falls and Jason, sporting the late comic relief's hockey mask (and now the killer's trademarked fashion accessory), gets to work rubbing them all out one by one in more or less inventive ways.

It's just another bunch of horndogs shacking up at a cabin in the woods and you know who is there. Surprised?. Of course not. The only historical thing about Part 3 is that it was originally in 3-D(not on video, sadly). Plus, it was also the introduction to Jason's hockey mask. The heroine, played horribly by Dana Kimmell, was a history with Jason. Apparently she was attacked by him a while back after she ran into the woods after having a fight with her parents. Whatever. Anyways, the film is violent and bloody as expected. There's even a murder scene that is very reminiscent of Kevin Bacon's demise in the original. The biker gang in this film are the only ones who do good jobs. Everyone else is pretty bad. Still, I like this movie. It's not the best Friday film, but it's up there. Richard Brooker, as Jason, is a good addition to the group of guys who've played him. The follow up, ""The Final Chapter"", was disappointing. Stupid, trashy fun.

Along with FINAL CHAPTER and the first one, F13 Part 3 is a classic of the 80's slasher genre.  Now for the DVD;  Although lacking in extras, F13 Part 3 is still a very good purchase on DVD.  Part 3, out of almost ANY Hollywood movie in history, badly needed a new digital transfer and clean-up.  All the VHS prints were so incredibly bad that it made it almost IMPOSSIBLE to watch.  From fading colors, to blurry images and poor cropping, F13 on VHS was just pitiful.  The new DVD makes this movie look like a million bucks.  Like it was brand new.

The story picks up with the last scene from the previous film, excluding the senseless, if scary, ""Widow"" scene, and instead showing the killer rising.  We then go to meet Harold and Edna, an unhappy couple who run a small mini-store.  While Harold fools around and eats food, Edna watches the news (where the newscaster is director Steve Miner) and hears that there's a killer still on the loose (of course, the scene IS a mistake, because it takes place the same night, but shows footage of the next day).  Well, can you guess what happens to Harold and Edna?
We then go to the next day, where we meet a nice, fresh btch of teenagers including Chris, who, for unknown reasons, is afraid of Crystal Lake, Chuck and Chilli, two dope smoking weirdos, Andy and Debbie, who unfortunately have a baby to look forward to in nine months (and still they make more?), prankster Shelly, who is after hot chick Vera, although Vera doesn't think to much of him.  These kids are going up to Higgin's Haven, where Chris's summer home is, a few miles near Camp Crystal Lake, for a relaxing weekend.  But, they haven't seen the news or heard the radio so they don't know that Jason is hanging out at Higgin's Haven.  When they all get there Chis is reunited with herboyfriend Rick (Paul Kratka), who is urging her to go all the way, although she refuses to.  And, to make things worse, Shelly is playing awful pranks and scaring Chris to death.  So, Shelly and Vera go out to town, only to get trouble as a group of bikers steal their money and break their windshield. So, Shellly runs over their motorcycles, making the bikers angry, and making the bikers follow them to the camp.....
Friday The 13th Part 3 is propably  the best of the original four Friday movies.  The acting is this entry is actually very ood and some of the charecters are funny.  Jason really gets his hockey mask in this one too.  Who could forget that scene where Jason comes walking out of the barn, onto the dock, with that gorgeous hockey mask, speargun in hand.  It's a classic scene, heck, IT'S THE FIRST EVER SCENE OF JASON WEARING A HOCKEY MASK!!!!!.  Also  this one was the only one that scared me.  None of the others scared me, but this one did.  I don't know why.  But I remember watching it, and clutching up close, to see what happens next.  It just really scared me.  But, you may be wondering about whether or not there is any point in watching this movie without the 3-D glasses.  Well, I really had no problem with the lack of 3-D.  I never saw it in theatres, but I think in 3-D it would not have been scary, because you're always waiting for the next cool thing to stick out at you.  So I am fine watching this movie without glasses.  It might not be the best movie for a party though (my friends complained every time there was a 3-D shot).
This DVD is excellent.  Unfortunately, Friday The 13th The Final Chapter, didn't get such a good DVD.  The Final Chapter had a mudgey, mud like picture that seemed to have dots dancing around on the screen.  But this one has a crisp, beautifull picture, with no distactions in color or mudges.  The sound is fine, and the widescreen ratio (2:35:1) really shows what you've been missing.  There's also a theatrical trailer (I love it) and Chilli's murder is extended (for more extended murders see Mrs. Voorhee's and Annie's deaths in the original).

Actually, I found this sequel to be the most scariest since its original film, with Jason creeping in and out of the barn, as this was the first film Jason gets his hockey mask, which would later become his trademark.
  FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 has an amazing menu board, identical to the frontal video cover.

The B-movie shaky cameras are no-longer existent, making the film somewhat less thrilling.  At the same time, the humor that pervades this sequel comes off as corny, rather than funny.  Honestly, two dopeheads don't really belong in this series.  Save that for ""Halloween"".  This movie started Jason's cult appearance, as he bares his trademark hockey mask and goes after college kids who invade his forest habitat.
Contrary to what many fans believe, this one actually takes place at a separate camp ground, Higgins Haven, located just miles down the road from Crystal Lake.  And yet somehow, Jason manages to find them and kill them in fashionably violent, if not comical ways.  Entertaining still, but the series started to show its limits, and needed to go off in a different direction, which it does starting with the fourth installment.
Probably one of the weaker sequels, but a benchmark film nonetheless.  It has its moments, and definitely captures the darkness provoked by its predecessors.  It just seemed a little too hokey at this point.",997488000,,1214,4.9950248756218905

Part 3 is good to rent only for the scares, but it ain't as good as the first 2.
It also doesn't make much sense. In Part 2, when Jason jumped through the window he still had the machete in his shoulder. But at the beginning of Part 3, there was an extra clip from Part 2 that shows him pulling the machete out just before attacking Ginny through the window. Also in Part 2 he had long hair and a beard. In Part 3, he was bald, and his whole entire face was messed, and Part 3 only took place a day after Part 2. So it doesn't make much sense.

I found that hallarious and totally agreed. The characters in part three reffered to as ""the wild bunch"" are believable and quite hysterical. I don't always like the characters in all of the Friday films, but these ones were classical and a good type of strange. You got your ... prankster, you got your two lovebirds, you got your two hippie lovebirds, a chick with a terrible past, a country boy, a blind date for the fat... prankster, two durranged adult lovebirds, a motorcycle gang, and an old man on the road completing the dead or alive Ralph character. My favorite character in this movie seems to change over the years, but recently it is Debbie,  and  or  Chuck. I don't know why. Anywho, this one is different from the others, is more conceptive about the creative events and lets you get to know Crystal Lake more.... I thought the funniest part in the movie was after Chuck roughed up the bikers bikes and the the black biker, I think Ali, approached him in his car. You will just have to see what happens then. Crystal Lake has nice greenery and woods, bueatiful sparkling lakes( wouldnt swim in them if you know what I mean )and some of the MOST of the people are nice. The art of this film is to turn a pleasant environment with funny people and nice couples to a living homicidal hell that the residents wish that they hadnt entered. Steve Miner did to the wilderness outdoor country what Alfred Hitchcock did to hotels and showers. Although the MPAA chops his movies up a bit sometimes, Steve Miner is a great director. The simplicity of Friday 3 is as simple as everyday life, that is what makes it and the other Friday movies what they are. This was the best one though, it was a classic, and anyone who says that it is an over used, poorly acted ...fest is not looking hard. This is a classic, you will like. Really. This is also the first one where infamous Jason recieves his hockey mask, that certainly makes it a cant miss. The ending is very well done, see the ending of the first Friday and see how the two endings collide. ....",993945600,3,2454,4.342047930283225

The movie might be awful, but there is some very little entertainment to be gained from it (this is what saved the film from getting one star from me); the entertainment factor was reduced due to the horrible acting by some of the cast.

258527,2,6300214311,"FRIDAY THE 13th PART III

(USA - 1982)

Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (3-Depix)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Though not without entertainment value, the third entry in this long-running series (initiated by FRIDAY THE 13th in 1980) is no more than disposable fluff, reliant on its 3-D gimmick to draw a mass audience. It serves no other purpose. Whereas the first two movies established the basic premise (the villain in part 2 takes up where his/her predecessor left off in part 1), ""Part III"" doesn't advance the scenario at all, merely restages the same plot as before: Teens take a weekend trip into the woods and are targeted for destruction by the seemingly unstoppable Jason.

The plot is negligible, the characters conform to stereotype, and the constant stream of violent murders seems even more senseless than before. In fact, the indiscriminate nature of Jason's victims allows consistency to fall by the wayside, thereby signalling the film's status as little more than a mindless thrill-machine, the victim of lazy scriptwork by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson. To be fair, however, it's doubtful that a radical change in the basic scenario would have been acceptable to contemporary audiences. In 1982, these simple thrills were more than enough to ring the box-office bell, and woe betide any producer who dared to mess with a winning formula!

The best efforts of sophomore director Steve Miner (also responsible for FRIDAY THE 13th PART 2, 1981) are compromised by two important factors: First, the cast seems to have been chosen on the basis of looks rather than acting ability, and the only character with a halfway decent plot-thread (the overweight guy whose feeble pranks are a desperate attempt to ingratiate himself with his peers) meets a predictably 'ironic' end long before his genuine emotional distress can be allowed to detract from the orchestrated mayhem. And secondly, the requirements of 3-D photography - in particular, the attention paid to the point of convergence from shot to shot, in order to prevent eyestrain and headaches in the audience - has resulted in visual and dramatic compromises, slowing the movie's rhythm and sapping all vitality from the narrative (this was true of many other 3-D movies which opened the following year). Seen in 3-D, the extra dimension is a genuinely effective novelty which enhances the viewing experience tenfold, from the opening credits (which seem to shoot out of the screen with startling clarity) through to the extended finale when Jason's rampage literally spills into the audience's lap. Viewed flat, for all its bloody violence and exaggerated body count, the film is a lumbering, pointless rehash of the first two entries, with no identity of its own.

258567,4,6300214311,"What I felt before was a quite mediocre entry in the series(speaking relatively, of course), I now feel is one of the most superior.  What makes the difference?  Widescreen.  Steve Miner is a master of the form(see the underrated House or Halloween:H20) and injects this sequel with a lot of atmosphere and tension which was not as evident on previous pan-and-scan video releases of the film.  For instance, consider the scene where Chris relays her previous experience with Jason to her boyfriend Rick.  On video, it had always appeared as if the couple had just stopped at a random spot in the woods to talk.  In widescreen, however, the entire left side of the picture is taken up by the side of a cabin and by a drainpipe spilling water throughout the scene.  This one small detail adds a whole other layer to the atmosphere of the scene.  You also get to see a lot more of Higgin's Haven and the surrounding woods and lake in widescreen. Also, as previously mentioned, the showdown/chase scene that climaxes this film is amazingly suspenseful, especially for an early 80's slasher sequel.  Widescreen allows you to see Jason running up along the side of the barn as Chris enters.  Creepy!
One last note about the DVD:
For years, Friday fans have lamented the lost death scene footage excised by the MPAA before the films were released to theaters.  Well, apparently someone in the DVD department at Paramount is a fan, for Chili's death scene via firepoker in the Friday 3 DVD is  the unrated cut.  Wherein previous video versions, there is only a shot of the firepoker exiting her back, in the DVD version, a relatively long sideshot has been inserted showing Jason plunging the firepoker all the way through her and then slightly twisting it.  This extra shot is worth the price of the DVD.  Hopefully unrated death scenes will show up on future Friday releases also.  I'd love to see some of the unrated footage from Friday 6 and 7.",972345600,25,1940,4.695266272189349
258568,4,6300214311,"Friday the 13th part 3 is a relatively good third entry in this extremely popular series.  Part 3 stands out with some very good acting and some great shocks-including one very frightening final confrontation with the masked killer. The plot is nothing terribly original-or even existant-but the characters are a little bit more fleshed out than usual and some of the murders are truly shocking (the sphere in the eye, the pitchfork in the barn and the throat slashing of Shelley).  People who follow the series from afar have pointed out that Jason looks terribly different than in the previous film (which took place the previous day).  This is entirely untrue.  Jason is a little bigger this time out, but he's still a wild child, malformed and creepy to the extreme.  Richard (Jason) Brooker played a very underrated Jason, the entire chase at the film's finish is almost worth the price of this DVD alone.  Brooker's Jason is part wild child and part methodical assassin, a hunter both brilliant and untamed.  Jason is what's lurking in the woods at night when you sleep.  He's a creepy character and here in part 3, he's totally effective. Paramount's DVD is pretty well done, the film looks great in its original 2.35:1 widescreen format, the transfer is very nice.  Friday the 13th part 3 may be the weakest of the original four, but if you're in the mood for 96 minutes of intense horror and overall slasher fun, grab this disk, it's worth the money.",971740800,8,1459,4.757936507936508
258569,5,6300214311,"If Paramount's A-movie franchise was Star Trek, then their B-movie franchise would definitely be Friday The 13th. A total of eight were made and, with the exception of '83, there was a Friday The 13th for every year in the Eighties, with the TV series debuting in '87.

They were tacky, badly made and infrequently showed any professionalism, or dynamic filmmaking. But they sure had their moments and Part 3 is definitely the best of the first four, Part 5 being the joker in the pack and 6-8 the second instalment of the Jason Voorhees legacy.

Apparently, not getting enough of butchering teenagers with the first sequel, director Steve Miner returns for more unlucky day murders. While his first outing was almost the exact same as the original, only with a different killer, Part 3 reinvents the franchise and totally solidifies Jason as a horror movie icon.

Chris (Dana Kimmel) has had a difficult past few years and she decides to spend a long weekend at Higgins Haven with her friends. Too bad for them that Jason (Richard Brooker) is lurking in the woods. He and Chris have had a scuffle in the past and she's afraid to go out there alone.

Her friends are an unusual bunch. There are a couple of stoners, Shelly, a fat kid who just wants to be loved (Larry Zerner), a pregnant friend (Tracie Savage) and her hunky squeeze (Paul Kratka). These are not the typical goofball sex-mad teenagers of the early Eighties. For some reason, the writers have made them somewhat subdued and realistic. They seriously want a quiet weekend - no partying, no loud music. It helps that we like them, because in most other occasions we can't wait for them to get slaughtered.

And they aren't the only ones in trouble. A non-threatening biker gang plan to cause havoc at Higgins Haven, because Shelly knocked over their scooters, and end up regretting it. If anything, they make for some light comedy - intentional, or not.

Halfway through, Shelly pulls a joke on the girl he fancies. He leaps out of the water wearing a hockey mask and brandishing a harpoon. Five minutes later Jason gets his hands on them. And ever since, the image of the hockey mask has been the trademark of the series.

In every other sequel, Jason is a walking monolith. [...], show Michael Myers a thing or two about the art of teenage massacre and somehow be able to maintain his cool and make it all seems effortless. This is the only time you will see him for what he really is - a retarded hillbilly. He evens smiles! Twice!!

Miner would return later to the same location in Lake Placid. Here, he successfully portrays Crystal Lake as a tranquil, peaceful place and manages, in the final scenes, to infuse it with atmospheric excitement, all without the use of rain, or lightning.

It wouldn't be hard to make a sequel superior to the original Friday The 13th. Miner failed with Part 2, but excels in Part 3. It has a lighter tone and different feel from the others. In fact, it shouldn't be viewed as a horror film at all. It's an adventure movie, set in the woods, with one of the best villains ever.",971136000,80,3076,4.598540145985401

Indeed, the new ""super 3D"" process was great - super clear and a lot of depth. However, unless you are able to view in 3-D --unlikely--, this is one of the lamest of the series with one of the lamest endings (although, Dana Kimmel is great at being hysterical and you might get a kick out of the stoned chick and her boyfriend).

258612,4,6300214311,"This is a great chapter in the series. It's great to see that Jason finally has his hockey mask and not the lame sack from part 2. The film is much gorier than part 2 and is almost as gory as the first. The FX are pretty good,especially when the biker gets his arm sliced off. The atmospehere is  creepy and fits in just right. The music,as usual, is very creepy. Richard  Brooker is great at playing Jason. The ending is pretty gross and very  creepy indeed. The confrontation between Jason and Chris
at the end is  very intense and will really keep you at the edge of your seat. Would've  gotten five stars had there been 3-D viewing. Hopefully,a remastered VHS and  the DVD will have a 3-D engine and free glasses. This is definitely one the  best. Just as rich and scary as part 2,though not quite as creepy as parts 4  and 6. Rated R-contains gory violence,strong language,drug use and a scene  of brief nudity.",956275200,2,916,4.404761904761905

You see, This is the one where good ol' Jason receives his now Infamous hockey-mask! The death scenes are gory  & bloody good, what did u expect!  I like the cast! The acting is  over the top and of course ridiculous at times, lol. This is the best one  is the series! There's not really any good T & A in here, ohh, except  for that chick Chris (The main character in the blue sweater), I think  she's a total cutie with a firm toosh! Well,BUY THIS! Run don't walk! Jason  is and always will be the killer of killers! HAil him!",953942400,2,639,4.138211382113822

258646,3,6300214311,"steve miner actually made an attempt at making a half decent film with this one. this is the first one where jason gets his mask. the ending of this film leaves one rather confused and kind of takes away from the film.  had this film been released on the video format in 3-D, this film would've  been better but i guess that us viewers will just have to use our  imaginations for that...this one was ok...nothing more",951523200,,417,4.3896103896103895
258647,5,6300214311,"The third in the infamous slasher series, is the best in my opinion. The picture is filthy, which adds to the atmosphere of the film. This filthy pictured horror atmosphere plays a major role in the film, as an entry into  the horror genre. Many '70s and '80s horror flicks carried gritty pictures,  which made them wonderful. In the '90s  its unfortunate that many horror  films have not been made with gritty pictures. The next Friday the 13th  film(s) will unlikely have the great gritty stuff. So I'll have to look for  the gore, t&a and the presence of Jason, to see its delicious effects.  In Part 3, another slew of teenagers go to the woods and get chopped to  bits. But one of them has a near-10 minute battle with Jason, which also  adds to the film's greatness. The gore is probally at it's best!",951264000,3,807,4.472602739726027
258648,3,6300214311,"Jason gets up, after being injured at the end of Part 2 and this time, hunts down a group of teens on vacation. About as much plot as the first two, give or take. Very entertaining (except for a few unenjoyable toilet  scenes), and keeps you in suspense all the way through. The best so far.",950832000,,291,4.196428571428571
258649,3,6300214311,"Though this film is a virtual re-make of its predecessor (teenagers near Camp Crystal Lake get slaughtered one by one) it is at least a step in the right direction for this series.  Jason is much more of an intimidating  figure than before and there are at least some interesting characters  besides the stereotype dozy teenagers.  Shelley is a humorously nerdy  practical-joker, and the scenes involving him and the bike gang make  essential viewing.
The film is also in 3-D, which means that all you need  is a pair of those red-green glasses and before you know it there'll be  baseball bats, knives, severed eyeballs and even Jason himself coming  straight out of the TV screen.
Don't expect much of a plot, but it's  certainly much more worthwhile than most of the early Friday the 13th  films.",949536000,2,799,4.759124087591241
258650,3,6300214311,"Acclaimed director Steve Miner (the notoriously neverending House films and Halloween H20) handles Friday the 13th Part 3 brilliantly. From a slow Part 1 and 2 nobody expected to see this as a decent horror movie but in  fact it wasn't that bad. Jason gets his murdermask in this one, the famous  hockeymask. More humour is added in this suspenseful slasher thriller with  3D effects, which at the time in the early eighties was a real plus.  Probably one of the best of the series but the plot still remains the same-  a group of libidinous teenagers despite warnings enter the bloody Camp  Crystal only to be stalked upon one by one. The acting isn't great but as I  said before not a bad attempt to what we later see as a worthless series.",949363200,,742,4.492537313432836
258651,4,6300214311,"The 3rd installment is fairly good but still a bit samey. This is the landmark film, because this is the first time Jason gets his trademark hockey mask.
The killings are better than ever as Jason is more creative.  I particually liked the fact we see a lot of his hideous face. The ending  is reminiscent of the original film.",948240000,,327,4.433333333333334

The MPAA board let more slip by  their normally strict censorship of the series with this installment.  This one combines great shock and suspense with graphic special effects and  even a sense of humor.  A 3-D DVD version should be released.",943660800,5,424,4.613333333333333

7806273,2,6300214311,"While it's neat to see some of these scenes play out in 3D, I cannot recommend this due to the fact that this movie is presented in anaglyphic 3D rather than the polarized 3D format that it was shown theatrically. This is the reason why the 3D intro credits won't have a 3D effect.

You do get a good sense of depth in some scenes, but so much of the novelty is taken away  when you watch an entire movie bathed in red/green.

If you buy this, it's almost a guarantee you'll only watch the 3D version once.",1518480000,,506,4.142857142857143

7806277,1,6300214311,"Not going to talk about the movie itself, just that this is NOT authored in standard BluRay 3D.  This is gawd-awful anaglyphic 3D which NO one uses for Blu-Ray 3D.  It uses Red/Green ""glasses"" (cheaper than cheap paper cutouts with red and green cellophane for the filters).  If you think you are going to use your actual active or passive 3D system glasses that you use for every other 3D BluRay you've got in your library, forget about it.  This bastardized 3D ""process"" barely can sustain the 3D illusion, is painful on the eyes and makes you feel like you are going blind given that the only color you can see in one eye is dark red and the other is green.  It's absurd that with both the active and passive perfected 3D systems that are the standard for home 3D and available to every studio, that Paramount has chosen to author this title in an inferior, NON-STANDARD format that no studio in the industry used since the age of BluRay digital 3D.  This garbage anaglyphic system is a gimmick reserved for comic books and the back of cereal boxes, not today's 3D digital system.

That said, the real disgrace here is that both Paramount and this seller, CD Exchange #5 are listing this as just  ""3D,"" with no reference of the fact that it's not real 3D.  They want to dupe the public into thinking it is the same 3D as every other 3D release on the market -- one that will play with the passive or active 3D glasses they have in their home 3D system.  It's a con.  Nowhere in the description of the Blu-Ray is it mentioned that this is old-style, barely watchable, anaglyphic red/green system.  Even the back sleeve shows a pair of 3D glasses and the lenses are distinctly not red and green -- again, a deliberate attempt to con the potential buyer into thinking this is normal Blu-Ray 3D.  DON'T BE CONNED -- it's NOT!  Shame on Paramount; shame on CD Exchange #5 for this deception.  I suppose they figure, the disc contains the 2D version, so the poor schlubs who bought it will just throw their hands up and say, ""Oh well, I'll settle for just watching it in 2D"" and not bother returning it to get a refund.  Well, I bought it SPECIFICALLY for the 3D and it's going back today, just on principle.  Had they made it clear it was anaglyphic, then it's on me; but they purposefully made sure they never mentioned the red/green, non-standard, garbage, inferior process anywhere in the description or on the jacket, so that's on them.  Excuse me while I sign up for my return and refund.",1517011200,2,2491,4.4734513274336285
