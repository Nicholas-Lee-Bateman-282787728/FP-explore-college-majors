7786204,5,B01HDQCBJ6,"What a wonderful series, heartfelt and meaningful. They don't make shows like this anymore. I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband and we put on a DVD when we get in from work. We loved this when it was on television in the late 80s and 90s.",1484784000,4,257,4.16

7786209,5,B01HDQCBJ6,I had to own it now that it's gone down in price. One of my favorite shows and still as funny and charming as it's always been.  Hours of new interviews that everyone has participated in from cast to crew. All involved are giving interesting stories and and talk at length.  Neat to see the entire cast together in one room again. Glad I got my hands on this set as it appears it may be oop. Picture quality isn't Bluray but so what. A must have box set to me.,1482969600,2,460,4.043956043956044
7786210,5,B01HDQCBJ6,"Finally, one of the best shows from TV is available on DVD.  This is a well-done, light-hearted ""coming of age"" show that just feels good to watch.  A great escape from today's reality!  This set is a straight-forward set and does not include any fancy extras, like magnets.  For me, just having the show was what I wanted, which is why I opted to save $60 over other sets that have bells-and-whistles extras.

Well worth the money for anyone looking to own a DVD set of a fantastic TV show.",1482796800,7,491,4.411111111111111
7786211,1,B01HDQCBJ6,"I did not give this one star because I don't like the series. In fact, The Wonder Years is one of my most favorite television shows!  I gave this one star because it's a ver poor value. Many years ago, I purchased this series and the package was a MUCH better value! The package that I bought came in a school locker, with a couple of magnets for the locker, a school flag and a school t-shirt. In fact, that package was the same price as this package that is being offered here.",1482105600,,479,4.150537634408602
7786212,5,B01HDQCBJ6,Love this.  Finally have my favorite TV on DVD.  So much better than my VhS takes I recorded when the show originally aired.,1480723200,9,124,4.3478260869565215
7786213,5,B01HDQCBJ6,"The Wonder Years: The Complete Series is an affectionate look at growing up in the late 60s and early 70s in suburban America.
The central character, Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage), a sixth grader at Kennedy Junior High School, tries valiantly to reduce his teenage angst while dealing with older brother Wayne (Jason Hervey), rebellious sister Karen (Olivia dAbo), workaholic father Jack (Dan Lauria), and housewife mom Norma (Alley Mills). Regular characters on the show are Kevins best friend, Paul (Josh Saviano), and potential love interest girl-next-door Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar). Daniel Stern provides off-screen narration as an older, wittier Kevin.

What makes the show a genuine TV classic is its combination of sentiment, nostalgia, and top-notch writing. For those who grew up then, the show is a beautiful recreation of the era, as seen through the eyes of a child gradually taking on the responsibilities of adulthood, with all the trials and tribulations they entail. Kevin and his friends are placed in coming-of-age situations against the background of actual historical events.

The set contains over 300 classic period songs as they were used in the original broadcasts, by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, The Byrds, Simon & Garfunkel, Aretha Franklin, and James Taylor, and Joe Cockers theme for the show.

This box set of 22 DVDs contains all 115 episodes from the programs six seasons, which aired from 1988 to 1993. Included are complete show notes with episode synopses, cast member reflections, Current Events, highlights from the first cast reunion in 16 years, roundtable discussions with Danica McKellar, Fred Savage, and Josh Saviano; 6 newly produced featurettes, the one-hour ABC broadcast of the series finale, and exclusive interviews with the shows creators and cast.",1471824000,55,1828,5.340277777777778
7786214,2,B01HDQCBJ6,"I was expecting all the episodes, but only got a few for each season.",1528848000,,69,4.0
7786215,5,B01HDQCBJ6,"THE WONDER YEARS: Easily the best show about nostalgia since Leave It to Beaver (which of course only became nostalgic in reruns), The Wonder Years chronicled the life and times of late sixties kid Kevin Arnold, played to wide eyed perfection by Fred Savage. Punctuated by the era's pop classics and Daniel Stern's warm voiceovers, Kevin dealt with a no nonsense Dad, doting Mom, free spirit sister, despicable older brother, and his best friends, geeky Paul and crush-worthy Winnie Cooper. Plot lines in the laugh track-free series walked a tightrope between hilarious and serious, making liberal use of flashbacks and fantasy sequences, with stellar acting by every cast member. Nothing quite like The Wonder Years had ever graced television before its 1988 debut...there's been nothing like it in the three decades since.

RATING: FIVE YEARS",1528761600,4,844,5.2518518518518515

7786219,5,B01HDQCBJ6,"I watched every episode and have come to a conclusion: Kevin Arnold is a jerk. I love the show and the time period it is in, great stories and characters. I actually like Kevin's high school episodes that introduce new characters and situations. Usually takes a show several seasons to get going but this show took from the start. I recommend this collection to anyone who loves this show.",1526774400,,389,4.6521739130434785

7786227,3,B01HDQCBJ6,"I enjoyed watching this series when I was younger, and being able to reminisce with this box set of all the seasons is just wonderful. My only complaint would be that the quality is as it was back when it initially aired, so it's not digitally remastered like I had assumed.",1517875200,,274,4.392156862745098
7786228,5,B01HDQCBJ6,"Haven't had time to watch every disc yet, but I love the show and so far the discs have worked fine.  Some people have complained about the fuzzy quality, but I think that has to do with two issues.  First, it wasn't shot in HD, so unless they digitally remaster it, it's not going to have the quality we're used to.  Secondly, I really only notice the fuzziness on ""flashbacks"", so it might just be a device the director is using to differentiate between ""now"" and ""then"".

When it arrived, the cardboard box it traveled in was crushed in places, but the dvd set was fine.",1517702400,9,573,4.377358490566038

It has a great cast, relatable and well balanced storylines, one minute your laughing the next you could be crying this show with all that plus the best soundtrack I've heard of any show adds to how amazing and close to perfection this show is, if your a big fan of the show like me than I definitely recommend the locker set with extra features or if your on a budget this set is also great!",1517011200,,585,4.185840707964601

7786235,5,B01HDQCBJ6,"Finally all the seasons in one pack. Great extras. Picture quality is not great but, a tip:  if possible play the discs with a player with composite, s-video, or component video signal. HDMI tries to up convert the picture but it ruins it. To those who are wondering about how the discs are packaged..It is the same as if you purchased each season separately. Standard DVD cases. No paper sleeves, or anything like that.",1513382400,14,420,4.675675675675675

Good extras, but every guy no matter if they went to junior/high school in the 60, 70,  or 80 - all had the winnie coopers, Madeline's(Cheer Leader type) and of course there was always one miss white in there some place, all had the Kevin narrations, but were to dumb, affraid or plain just scared to act on them, brings back the memories.",1501632000,4,630,4.206611570247934

7786249,5,B01HDQCBJ6,"I enjoyed this series back in the eighties when it came out. The setting and music is from my youth and I have fond memories of that time. Season one - Pilot and Phone Call. Season two - Steady as she goes, Just between me, you and Kirk and Paul and Carla and Becky. (I like him but I don't like him like him. Before I liked him liked him but now I just like him.) HUH!! Nemesis, I just loved Becky. Took me a while to find out that Danika and Crystal were sisters. DUH!! Season three - Math Class and Wayne on wheel, Tree house and the neighbor with the bodacious Ta-Ta's. Season four - Ninth Grade Man, It's a Mad Mad Madeline world, Heartbreak (who hasn't gone through that) Season five - The lake, Grandpa's car, The lost weekend. For those who ever threw a small party that got out of hand! Season six - White lies (Get in your car, drive over there and apologize. You think she will listen? I wouldn't)  Alice in auto land and of course the the two part series finally. The round table with Danika, Fred and Josh on season two disk is really worth watching. Season three interviews with Danika, Crystal, Olivia and Jason also worth watching.",1498089600,7,1147,4.285714285714286
