8290306,5,B001CXAJPU,I love Cesar Millian but some people don't and that's okay. In my opinion I think his videos are extremely helpful when trying to help your dog but people need to know sometimes dogs are too difficult to do some of the stuff on their own. So i recommend if your dog is extremely tough to go see a training but if you love Cesar like me and just want to watch him help a dog then go ahead and buy this because I think it's great!,1397260800,,428,3.9310344827586206
8290307,5,B001CXAJPU,"This is an excellent priced combo offer to buy so many video's.
I love dog whisperer seasons.
These are yet not telecast in India, so i always look forward for new releases and would like to watch them at my ease.
Each season is so different, and you love to watch the again and again.
The direction is very much improvised with more perfect coverage of each expression and cesar's approach in rehab.

oh, Aren't you having this in your collection ??",1300060800,,450,4.487804878048781
8290308,5,B001CXAJPU,The Dog Whisperer is an amazing dvd.  He is so talented with dogs and know just how they think and react.  Excellent dvd.,1274832000,,121,4.217391304347826
8290309,5,B001CXAJPU,"Perfect!!!!!!!!!
  Cesar Millan gives a dog credit for being able to live within their own mind, a mind which seeks to remain content to be alive in the perfect image of Life's Living Perfection: The One and Only Moment Being Here Now. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a better relationship with their dogs. Perfect methods for teaching the human to realize the mental worth of each and every being upon this planet.",1267056000,,425,4.72972972972973
8290310,5,B001CXAJPU,I purchased the first three seasons of the Dog Whisperer for my daughter as a Xmas gift. She was very happy as it is one of her favorite shows. Not much else to say - the product was delivered as promised and it is what was expected.,1263081600,,233,3.978723404255319
8290311,5,B001CXAJPU,"Again, a Happy Birthday to Cesar Millan.  Any Advanced Professional Groomer, Pooch Owner, etc., should add Cesar Millan's products, brilliantly produced and co-written by Melissa Jo Peltier, to their collection of DVD.s  Thanks once again to Amazon and UPS for bringing it home.",1251417600,,278,5.441860465116279
8290312,5,B001CXAJPU,"All his advice on showing leadership and putting aggressive dogs at ease by showing them their place - all of it applies to dealing with difficult people at work, controlling a classroom of preschoolers, working in a psychiatric ward... if someone does not lead, the situation becomes tiring, dangerous!

The guy is a real genius, and is a perfect example of a transcendental immigrant, someone who has the perspective to see how unbalanced Americans are, and is able to provide a productive reflection of ourselves, so we can see ourselves as indulgent and change ourselves to become the disciplined leaders that dogs so desperately need.

My five year old has watched all the episodes and has memorized the lines, and now has me under her command - the lessons are powerful.

Get all three seasons - much healthier for you and your family and more economical than the crap on television.  This is not entertainment - it's business management, self-help, theology...",1243382400,,967,4.987577639751553
8290313,5,B001CXAJPU,"There are lots of dog training techniques on the market and all are valid and informative.  The Dog Whisperer is not for training your dog to jump through hoops, fetch, roll over, etc. So do not think that is what you are buying when you purchase these DVDs. This collection is for dogs with discipline problems.  If you have an aggressive dog, neurotic dog, barking dog, biting dog, car chasing dog, or any dog with behavioral issues, this is the DVD collection for you.  They are a must own for dog owners.

Dog disobedience is like bad parenting. Most problems start with the parent who is using improper methods of training that lead to behavioral problems in their children.  I like the way Cesar says in the beginning of each DVD...""I train the people...I rehabilitate the dog"".  So true.  If you are willing to take a long look at yourself in the mirror and ask ""What can I do different to help my dog""...then order these DVDs and apply them.  If you are not an accountable pet owner, then buy a stuffed animal instead.

Not only do Cesar's methods work, these DVDs are fun to watch.  They are also heart warming.  Our family loves to watch them.  We learn as we are entertained.  Great for the whole family.",1241481600,4,1215,4.518348623853211
8290314,5,B001CXAJPU,"Being a first-time dog owner, I didn't realize what I was getting into when we adopted our 9-week-old golden retriever, Jerry.  To say the least, he was a handful- teething constantly, jumping on people and running wildly at incredible speeds inside the house.  Dog training has helped tremendously with obedience training, but Cesar Millan goes a step further in ""The Dog Whisperer"" series. He demonstrates in each of the shows the psychology of a particular dog- what causes this dog to have undesireable behavior and specifically, how to deal with it. It amazes me how important a simple hour-long walk every day benefits my dog and Mr. Millan stresses the importance of that walk in each and every show; of course, I make sure to be the alpha leader during the walk and that makes a big difference in Jerry's behavior for the entire day.  What has also been helpful to me is understanding the difference between contentment and nervous excitement; I have Cesar, The Dog Whisperer, to thank for that revelation because rewarding a nervous dog with affection only promotes that behavior and I was certainly doing a good deal of that before I started watching the series- again, many thanks to Cesar Millan, The Dog Whisperer.",1226275200,8,1227,4.889423076923077
