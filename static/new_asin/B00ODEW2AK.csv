6735573,4,B00ODEW2AK,"The quality of the video is exceptional---beautifully rendered colors and images. The discs were in pristine condition---no scratches or scuffs.  Another reviewer mentioned the lack of sub-titles or closed captioning---there are some captions when the contestants whisper to one another or talk under their breath but that is all.
My biggest disappointment was in the ""bonus material""---all that is offered is the racers at the elimination station.  Compare that to the Season One four-disc set which has over 90 minutes of un-aired additional scenes and a discussion with the producers, creators and Phil on them.  Even on their website, CBS shows  two-minute ""unseen"" mini-clips of the racers when the season is airing.  What becomes of that footage after the season is over?",1425254400,,777,5.336065573770492

6735577,2,B00ODEW2AK,"What fans will want to know is whether the company that release Amazing Race will get their quality control house in order and release a product that doesn't have scratched discs, scuff marks, missing scenes etc. To date each season seems to be plagued with these issues and neither the company nor Amazon care much to fix the problem, I stopped purchasing after season 11 after having seasons 5,6,8,9,10,11 all with scratches and scuff marks on near all the discs. From reading reviews on subsequent seasons, the same issue applies and nothing seems to be done about it.
The jury will be out on these next lot of sets till we see if things have improved. The price placed  of the set is absurd given the poor quality we have been served up season after season by the company making these..",1413504000,8,790,4.602836879432624

8683300,5,B00ODEW2AK,"If you are a fan of TAR then just about any of the previous seasons are an excellent addition to your video library.  These races, for me, are so addicting that I cannot be pulled away from the television the moment I put a disc in the player.  The additional features are just as exciting, they provide us with footage we don't see during the race.  I look forward to racing around the world, albeit from a comfortable chair at home, each season, learning about people and places as well and having a terrific time.",1431993600,2,516,4.410526315789474
