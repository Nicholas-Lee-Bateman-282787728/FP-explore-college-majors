6992783,3,B00SU4LXMC,Horrible 3D. It's better to watch it in 2D. Doesn't  worth the money.,1459468800,,69,4.3076923076923075
6992784,5,B00SU4LXMC,"Excellent 3D and presentation.  You get only a dozen or so of the more famous sculptures, but various paintings, including much of the Sistine Chapel, are converted into 3D!  Terrific job!  Plays perfectly on USA 3D players.",1456704000,9,224,5.0

Images and art works are very impressive on this Blu-Ray disk.
Fast shipping and great service.
Thanks.",1512086400,,158,5.36
8699283,3,B00SU4LXMC,"Good 3D, however, I think the product would be enhanced if a 360 user manipulated image were used and more statuary could be added.  The history of the pieces were interesting, but, not why I bought the product.  Not sorry for purchase, though.  A good non super hero 3D purchase.  Only slightly overpriced.",1507075200,,307,4.735849056603773
8699284,5,B00SU4LXMC,"Since I'm now too old to go to Rome, this is a welcome substitute. In 3d with a large screen it is as good as being there, without the aches and pains. It is also a history of the Vatican Museums, starting with the Pope that gave us Michelangelo and Raphael's greatest works, and who also saved many early Roman and Greek treasures. I understand that you can't squeeze hundreds of years of collecting into an hour or two. However, I could have done without the modern art pieces altogether, which would have given us time to look at other centuries of art.",1503446400,,556,4.407766990291262
8699285,2,B00SU4LXMC,The 3-D photography was very well done but this video lacks scope and depth. It seemed like they kept showing the same stuff over and over.,1501372800,,139,4.384615384615385
8699286,5,B00SU4LXMC,Having visited Rome in March 2017 this brought back the Vatican Museums and rekindled the memories.,1496793600,,99,5.25

8699288,1,B00SU4LXMC,Very poor presentation. More of an advertisement than a history and/or art discussion with many examples.. Definitely for 1st timers.,1489104000,2,133,5.7

8699291,3,B00SU4LXMC,"The blu-ray plays good... However, about the actual program: It is amazing that you have a ""documentary"" about the million items Vatican Museums, and they only show you about 10 things... They show the same scenes of these few artworks several times throughout. And in-between these few items, there a many scenes of dust floating about the head and hands of a man. Someone tried to be to artistic, but ruined the program. Very disappointing...",1469145600,8,444,4.933333333333334
