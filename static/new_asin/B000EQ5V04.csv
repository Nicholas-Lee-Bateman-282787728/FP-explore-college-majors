8113211,2,B000EQ5V04,"Three people want to join a fright club. They must each tell a scary story. The stories include a variation of Little Red Riding Hood,  a vampire tale, and a body parts harvester. None of them were anything to write home about.

The film wasn't anything that would grab you and make you remember it. The special effects at the end looked very fake,

I would take a pass.

8113212,3,B000EQ5V04,"Group of people want to get into a club, so they tell scary stories. The premise isn't anything too special but there aren't many movies like it. The director decided to tell the stories as an anthology rather than one solid movie.  I bought it on a whim since I saw the actress from Ghosts of Edendale in it. She improved a lot in performance and style.

Make up - Not the best I've seen, but not horrible either. I could believe the dead bodies. That werewolf did look pretty good.

The stories themselves were not inspired. They were just variations on themes already seen.

I don't want to give spoilers here, so I won't. Buy the movie, but don't expect great things. It was entertaining.",1279497600,3,692,4.468253968253968
