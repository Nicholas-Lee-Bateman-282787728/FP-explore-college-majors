8494768,4,B003Y9ZAT0,I gave this a four because the footage tends to be a little older but is still of good quality. I thought it gave a good account of the history of the F-15. The footage can be a little boring/long but I still think aviation enthusiasts will love this product because it is packed with information about the F-15 Eagle. I would recommend this product to a friend.,1363392000,,362,4.338235294117647
