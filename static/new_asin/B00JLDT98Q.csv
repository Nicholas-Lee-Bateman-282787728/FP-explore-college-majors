6378068,1,B00JLDT98Q,"Totally sucks, it's not worth the time or money to watch. You will never get this time back.",1410134400,,92,4.166666666666667
6378069,4,B00JLDT98Q,"Starts out a little flat but then picks up the fun stuff. FX are not bad. It's a low budget flick of course, with just a few sets. But the acting is fairly good though the writing lacks sometimes (not the actors fault). Just grab a drink, some popcorn, and have some laughs.",1409961600,2,274,4.188679245283019
6378070,1,B00JLDT98Q,"THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE PLOT SEEMED TO BE WRITTEN BY A KID AND WAS COMPLETE NONSENSE. THE ACTING WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM CHILDREN PUTTING ON A PLAY IN THE BACKYARD AND WAS CARTOONISH. AS SOON AS I FINISHED WATCHING THIS FILM, I TOOK IT OUT OF THE MACHINE AND THREW IT INTO THE TRASH. DEFINITELY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH.",1409011200,8,390,4.144736842105263

6378072,4,B00JLDT98Q,"This one's a fun ride.  If you're a fan of Action movies, Sci-Fi films, Girls with Guns or Michael Ironside, you'll want to check out this movie! Delivers the goods in terms of B movie entertainment and creative science fiction storytelling.  Some good laughs too...",1408406400,,266,4.888888888888889
6378073,1,B00JLDT98Q,"Class c movie, not the best of anything.",1408147200,,40,4.125
6378074,4,B00JLDT98Q,I enjoyed this Sci-Fi Action film with some cool visual effects and a good amount of humor.  A lot of eye candy in the cast with overall solid performances and a fun story that made it a worthwhile diversion.,1407888000,25,208,4.333333333333333
6378085,5,B00JLDT98Q,very good film,1427414400,,14,4.0

6378087,1,B00JLDT98Q,I like Canadian TV and love Sci-Fi fantasy; this mess almost makes me re-think my opinion.,1425600000,,90,4.6875
6378088,4,B00JLDT98Q,"Looks like it was made for tv.  Some scantily clad women fighting each other, men & cg monsters.  No nudity & one or two mild curse words.  Brigitte, the cover girl, is in this & looks great.  A sci-fi comedy.  Quite enjoyable.  Funny without being stupid.",1425340800,11,256,4.456521739130435
6378089,5,B00JLDT98Q,I love this girl,1424736000,,16,3.25
6378090,3,B00JLDT98Q,"Its an ok movie, low budget but good but the subtitles are nothing dealing with the movie so little bummed about that but over all its a good movie",1423872000,,147,4.103448275862069
6378091,4,B00JLDT98Q,"This is the sequel of ""Dark Rising"" which would have been more apparent had they left in the deleted scenes in the first film which tied them together.  Government agency  goes after Mardock [sic] when his return would bring about Armageddon. Film includes the same humor and cleavage as the first one. I liked the addition of Bulo (Mike 'Nug' Nahrgang) which added to the humor. Brigitte Kingsley and Cory Lee spend much of the film in bra and panties. There is an out of focused frame of Bridgette's breast in the distant.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Misrepresentation of Babylonian God Mardoc.  Good film for cleavage and cheese.",1423440000,10,640,4.790909090909091
6378092,3,B00JLDT98Q,It was decent but not as good as the first one,1423353600,,46,3.272727272727273
6378093,1,B00JLDT98Q,There not too many movies I hate but this is one.  It's slow moving.,1421884800,,68,3.857142857142857
6378094,2,B00JLDT98Q,Poor acting and the ctual plot was perdictable. this move could have been an excellent movie ith the right casting of characters. As is I would not recomend this movie. Fine anoher to watch. I found Continum a scfi thiller series which I've wached five time already. It's a great movie about how the time continum line. If one thing is changed what all will and does happen. The acting is awesome and there are three seasons. The actors are new and was made in Canada which is putting out great series. I would also recomend Oprhan black another Candaian series. Canada is relly putting out some great move series to watch.,1421539200,,623,4.571428571428571
6378095,5,B00JLDT98Q,Great movie to watch.,1419120000,3,21,4.5
6378096,3,B00JLDT98Q,Good film. Simple plot but decent for a low budget film.,1418515200,4,56,4.181818181818182
6378097,3,B00JLDT98Q,"Better than Dark Rising.  At least this one gives a little closure.  We get to find out a little more about why stuff happened in the first movie (Dark Rising).  Continuity issues were held a little tighter.  The wedding disaster and aftermath were funny which, for a movie like this, was important (helps combat other weaknesses).  Brings back (presumed dead) character from first movie, which was nice.  Like in the previous review - watched once and gave it away - as a set.",1417046400,3,477,4.686746987951807
6378098,1,B00JLDT98Q,I alstede about 15 minutes into it and then fell asleep - I really did soI cannot tell you anything about the rest of the movie - it was soooooo bad that even the kat feel asleep!,1416528000,,179,3.864864864864865

6378104,5,B00JLDT98Q,"Not so long ago, before a certain (activist and vocal) minority gained control of hollywood, most movies were made like this - enjoyable and watchable.  If you just want a movie to pass the evening, without being preached to with left-wing politics, then this is the one for you!  The women are eye candy (like all pretty women are meant to be) and the film is clearly targeted to the hetero male audience.  Oh, and if you are a normal male, you'll have rather pleasant dreams after you watch this film.  What more could you ask for?

BTW, the plot is forgettable, but the other elements make up for this deficiency.",1410825600,20,616,4.513513513513513
8652092,2,B00JLDT98Q,"This movie kinda looks like a film school senior project. They did the best they could with the resources available. The acting is not that bad, the actors did what they were asked to do pretty well. The story, direction and script were bad. Not offensively bad, just silly and inept. The fight scenes were terrible. The good guys are now packing demon blasting ray guns, I have mixed feelings about that. The props were lame, but the CGI was not too bad. It's more ambitious and improved over Bring Your Battle Axe. There were no topless lesbian make out scenes so points off for that. I really hoped for less from Brigitte Kingsley. She wore more clothes than last time and still no nudity  (what a disappointment). The ""Unprettier"" is back but the evil doers have it scouted. The original was amusing in an unselfconscious and mock pretentious way. Agency adds a full blown comedy relief character who is pretty funny but making everyone else more serious did not really work for me. Then, right at the end, Angelina Love from TNA wrestling appears. You can tell she is evil because although she is dressed almost exactly like Summer Vale, she also is wearing fishnet stockings. I do not know why they just crammed her in at the end of the movie (the final disappointment). They should have given her a better role!",1494460800,,1318,4.632478632478633

8652096,2,B00JLDT98Q,"why do I keep buying movies like this, I am no longer a teenager in the 70s? and how can I keep expecting less?",1446163200,,111,3.6666666666666665
8652097,4,B00JLDT98Q,I saw this on Amazon Prime instant video. In HD it was a reasonable price to rent. I watched this immediately after watching the first movie in the series Dark Rising. Agency of Vengeance (AoV) certainly had a bigger budget than the original and arguably better production values. The script and plot were more cohesive too. But AoV doesn't have the charm of first Dark Rising. Landy Cannon had apparently learned to act a bit (which was a surprise) and Brigitte Kingsley was as lovely as ever. But the action sequences lacked something (glowing gloves did not help) and the dark atmosphere had evaporated. It was nice to see they left room for a third movie as Renee escaped again. Not a bad sequel but let's hope a third movie finds the charm of the first one.,1445990400,,762,4.569343065693431
