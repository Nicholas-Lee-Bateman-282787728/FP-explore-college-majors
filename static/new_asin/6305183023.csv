975920,5,6305183023,"Jim Carrey's first staring role in a drama was wonderful.  He has successfully made the transition from goof-ball comic to serious actor.  It's great to see a well thought out and original story made into a movie.  Ed Harris does a remarkable job as Christof and Peter Weir's amazing camera  work, including the odd ""hidden camera"" angles are enough to  please any film student.  One of the best films of the year!",916099200,,414,4.680555555555555

976384,5,6305183023,"This is an intriguing film. Truman is in his mid or late 20s when we get to him in the present. The idea is that he was one of several children born from mothers who gave away their children for adoption at birth. He was the first one to be born and as such became adopted by the corporation represented by Christof, the director or this show. Suspend your disbelief a lot because the fact that he lived in this artificial cinema setting all his life, which means went to school on a daily basis and to college to get his qualification for his job, is a pure illusionary impossibility. It is maybe easier to make a few hundred people live in this community with only one real inhabitant, Truman, and all the others actors who have to be unionized in a way or another and hence cannot work more than a certain certainly limited number of hours a day and a week and a month and a year. And what about the population of a school from grade 1 to grade 12, not to speak of the full population of a college.

I will not consider the legal side of things. This abduction and total retention of a minor and then an adult in an artificial environment is pure imprisonment, which means totally illegal, and when Christof says Truman could leave anytime he wanted, it is an absolute lie since when Truman finally tries he is nearly killed by Christofs own decisions and acts. That amounts to the inhumane torturing of a grown up by another grownup with a whole bunch of accomplices pushing the buttons. This has to be said because everything in this show is REAL, really REAL. Not just Truman, but all the others. They are maybe a fake illusion for Truman but they are real actors and actresses, really acting on command, prompted by earplugs in constant relation with the studio. Instances of Christofs dictating to an actor what he had to say is even provided. It is all an illusion and a delusion for Truman, but it is all true. And I repeat totally impossible because beyond any material credibility and whats more beyond any human rights as for Truman, and in fact as for everyone in the film. Apart from Truman, they all behave either as criminals or accomplices of criminals.

But we have to accept to enter the film to find a deeper meaning in the story.

The first element is the delusional world in which Truman is forced to live. It has one motto written on a couple of arches: Unus pro Omnibus, Omnes pro Uno. This motto is old and was first used within some religious conflict in Bohemia in 1618. It is also a traditional motto in Switzerland, but not in Latin. In German Einer fr alle, Alle fr einen. In French Un pour tous, tous pour un. In Italian Uno per tutti, tutti per uno. And in Romansch In per tuts, tuts per in. The motto is generally translated into English as One for all, all for one. It is particularly famous because it is the motto of the famed and heroic though hilarious (three) Musketeers staged by Alexandre Dumas along with dArtagnan. This motto is immediately visually amplified by the name of the store on the corner of the street in front of these arches, Omnicol, though I do not know what this store might be selling.

This motto is very ethical and is obviously in full contradiction with real life where it is always everyone for oneself. This community, Seahaven, the very well named place because it is a haven and even a heavenly haven to its residents. Imagine keeping up with this illusion that this is a harbor (Le Havre in France) on a sea with no possible traffic, ships, and even the ferry is only a prop on the set. The only boat ever really shown is the boat in which Trumans father will die in a storm in front of Trumans eyes. And then at the end, the second boat will be Trumans escape boat in which he will nearly die by the decision of Christof himself who could not accept the escape with a cynical remark of his that sounds like a death sentence:

Network Executive: For God's sake, Chris! The whole world is watching. We can't let him die in front of a live audience!
Christof: He was born in front of a live audience.

At this moment Christof himself is showing the reverse motto: everyone is supposed to do what he wants, even Truman who may die if necessary to satisfy the selfish ambition of the power freak and the control freak Christof is. His name is the very antagonistic reference to Christ  he is an Antichrist  who is supposed to die for everyone and not the reverse. In fact, he is more like Ponce Pilate, thus turning Truman into the Christ of the story to be sacrificed for the interest of the show that is supposed not to die, since the show must go on, as Shakespeare said a long time ago. But this is a film and thats what makes the show a pure fable. The director of the film systematically creates a distance between Trumans experience and ours, the audiences experience, of Trumans fate. The public is shown as having a tremendous level of empathy for that young man who is going to be sacrificed on the altar of a reality TV show.

The director of the film systematically uses flashbacks, which is impossible in any reality show because they are not real since they only are recollections, fantasies or delusions. Christof himself uses in the show picture books with family pictures to make Truman and his band speak of the past in a realistic way. Here we feel the contradiction between the director of the film who uses flashbacks and the director of the show who uses recollections. But there is more along this line. A long time ago Christof got rid of the father by drowning him in a storm at sea in order to make the young boy so afraid of the sea that he will never want to leave the island of Seahaven, either by boat (see the ferry scene) or by road since the other way is a long bridge over the water and he cant drive over the water. In other words, Truman is traumatized by the event, hence by Christof for the only sake and interest of this individual who pretends to be God almighty. So imagine bringing the same actor who was the father into the picture as a homeless to be seized and removed as fast and strongly as possible from the scene with the moral of the story from Trumans mother and later in the press on the following day about cleaning up Seahaven of the homeless scum of society.

But the film catches the show at the moment when Christof is losing his grip on Truman who, late in his life since he should have wondered about his community a long time ago when he was sent to school, to college and when he traveled with his family to Mount Rushmore and on many other occasions, finally comes to grip with the absurdity of his artificially simple life. We can even wonder if he has a real sentimental or romantic life  meaning with normal physical intercourse  with his own wife who is an actress in a normal situation that does not imply any kind of real intercourse. Note the strange scene when Truman is taking care of his flowers in his garden on all fours. The camera that we may think is the wife Meryls vision, though we know now that all camera movements and choices are decided by Christof himself, this camera is heavily centered on the backside of Truman in his red shorts pointing up and you can even see and feel the underwear through the shorts. This is slightly obsessive or excessive and it may reveal in either the wife, which I doubt, or Christof, which I do not doubt at all, some kind of perverse fetishism that could reveal Christof is onanistically playing with his own psyche. And for eighteen years he had done it with a minor. Certainly not touching since he never sets foot on the set, but definitely seeing, watching, escrying, observing and many other visual verbs of all sorts, the boy for a long time, the young man then concupiscently if not lustfully.

This film is entirely based on voyeurism: voyeurism of all the actors on the set, voyeurism of the shooting team in the studio, voyeurism even of the audience of the TV show. And of course, we are the fourth level of voyeurism: the audience of the film. And that is a real problem. The only level that is critically and regularly deactivated as for the voyeurism concerning Truman is the audience of the film because many sentences in the film or in the show have double entendre and thus prompt us to think twice before sinking into believing. A few examples. Truman after the fake elevator scene says Maybe Im being set up or something. Even better the discussion between Truman and Marlon after Truman started panicking and is led by Marlon into reminiscing the old days when they were both boys cheating with life.

Marlon: We were right together.
Truman: We were wrong together.
Marlon: [Emotional, almost to the point of tears] The point is, I would gladly step in front of traffic for you Truman. And the last thing I would ever do to you...
Christof: [Feeding Marlon his lines] ... is lie to you.
Marlon: ...is lie to you. . . Youre the closest thing I ever had to a brother. . .  You were right about one thing though. You started all this.

At the end then the film shifts interests from Truman in Seahaven as the creature of Christof to Truman in Seahaven wanting his freedom and ready to fight and even die for it and to Sylvia in Hollywood wanting to support Truman in his quest for the Holy Grail of his Freedom. We are then centered on the defeat of Christof and his reluctance at being defeated and his final obligation to accept it because anyway the audience of the show has accepted this full liberation that ends the show and Please pass me the TV guide they are ready to move to another show if there is any other show of the same type, and there will always be one somewhere.

We can, of course, look at the film from a completely different point of view, and that is the manipulative nature of television. It is the medium that is the manipulator because of its technical and communicational power. The director Christof is only, in fact, the tool of this medium and he accepts to be the tool because it is his personal economic and professional interest to accept to be manipulated into being a tool. He thinks he is God almighty but he is nothing but a fool and he is constantly obeying the demands and requests from the medium. What makes that medium that powerful? The audience is the answer. The audience is manipulated by the medium into believing what they see is real, into all-sensorially responding to what they see with empathy and in a way personal projection into the main character, not to be him but to experience his state of mind, feelings, sentiments, passions, desires, frustrations and many other elements of the type. We could and we should push this idea a lot further but what is essential is that as soon as we shift to the cinema instead of television, then the manipulation does not work as much or even at all because the cinema requires a distance between the audience (seen as individuals in a crowd lost in darkness and thus exploded into human items if not artifacts) and the world, universe, situation presented in the film. Television is all-sensorial whereas the cinema is reflective. Television is based on a collective audience that shares in a way or another what they see and feel whereas the cinema requires an isolated and individualized experience of the film even if it is in a multiple audience hidden in the darkness of the room. In the first case, the distance of reflection is not possible. In the second case, the distance for reflection is indispensable.

976388,2,6305183023,"The only reason I don't like this film, and actually hate it, is for personal reasons.  The Truman show is actually a take off on a psychological formula (or psychiatric) to rehabilitate someone who has suffered some kind of trauma to his emotions.

The person in question is pumped up on ""happy pills"", otherwise known as anti-depressants.  And people around him are told of his condition, and to treat him ""nicely"" to create a need for him to lose his temper at why everyone around him feels like they're on drugs themselves.

I hate this film because I've been through this, several times over.  And it may or may not make national and international news.  We shall see.

The other reason I don't like this film is because Jim Carrey is in it.  He's actually very talented, and this is one of the few performances I think he really makes the character shine, but he can't help but give us his  trademark clich character of the overly happy late-1950's early 1960's mister WASPY suburban American, as he drives through life with a smile and pipe.

We don't know why he's the ""star"" of his own show, but he eventually escapes by leaving town.  Were it only that easy in real life.

The production values are top notch, but like a lot of psychiatric and psychological formulas ported to visual media like feature films, this one has a kind of science fiction or science fiction like setting, but minus any space ships, aliens nor ray guns.  It's strictly a ""contemporary"" film with over the top characters and comedy that isn't all that funny.

So why am I giving this thing two stars?  Because it's enough of a good looking film with some heart to it.  But, again, as someone who went through something like this for NO GOOD REASON, all I can say it's just another reason to fall out of love with movies, and perhaps pick up a good book on some notable historic figure.",1507420800,2,1870,4.537313432835821

The catch is that he doesnt know that his world is really the set of presumably the worlds most popular television show and his actions are determined/dictated by a manipulative executive producer type figure.

As I was watching the Truman Show, I couldn't help but notice the parallels with todays world, which has seemingly become saturated with reality television and this sort of fame cult. We are possibly coming very close to the line where something like the Truman Show isn't as outlandish. Cameras are seemingly everywhere, reality television is everywhere and the line between real life and television and movies is becoming blurry.

977040,5,6305183023,"I love this movie. It's so well made from start to finish. The way the world of Seabrook looks completely perfect and fake while the outside world looks normal shows the kind of production value they put into this.

Jim Carey, Fire Marshall Bill himself, is actually an amazing dramatic actor (though this is more of a comedy/drama).

I love how the film opens up with enough information about what is going on (Truman being on a reality TV show) but still focuses on his life inside the show for the first half hour or so to really immerse you into his life, then you see his world start to collapse the same way he's seeing it.

Fun story about the original marketing campaign for this movie. I was in Los Angeles in 1998 prior to the film's release. I learned about it when I randomly saw a ""FREE TRUMAN"" protest on the streets of LA. There must have been 300 people with signs and banners all chanting ""FREE TRUMAN BURBANK!"" It looked like a real live honest to god protest! I had no idea what was going on. But it was just a marketing campaign for the movie. It's how I learned about the film and it worked! I went to see the movie the week it opened to see what all the fuss was about.

So that's what I have to say about The Truman Show. And if I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!",1489622400,,1319,4.243027888446215

Carrey is able to do this within a superb storyline that is quirky and somewhat bizarre, but complex and unique. This film allows you to take a step back and think about what you see in the ""real"" world- some of it funny, some depressing, some outright maddening (that might include just plain stupid). Such is life. I could write a long essay or two about this film, but instead I will just add that the entire cast (including the minor roles) is the icing on a multi-layer movie that is absolutely excellent.",1489276800,4,680,4.628099173553719

977527,5,6305183023,"No scripts, no cue cards. This is the most distinctive feature in the film of the Truman Show which is a black comedy. The director of the TV play is a genius, who designs the life of the Truman. In the film, Truman is the protagonist of the TV play,but he doesnt know his own identity that  is an actor. The place he lives is in fact a big studio with hidden cameras everywhere, what he does is a live broadcast. Although almost 30 years has been passed, he fails to realize it. The audience are always watching everything happened in the Truman, without omitting anything. Finally, he struggled with the destiny and stroke his part to the director.
The film satirizes the social problem of focusing on the selfish purpose and human rights abuses. With the economic globalization, mass media are playing a more and more significant role in every corner. However, they use the convenience to infringe peoples privacy to gain their own interests. It is serious and common in our society. For instance, the entertainment reporters attempt to dig out the privacy of the celebrity, boosting its ratings. I strongly think that everyone has the right of privacy no matter he is a public figure or not. Many tragedies originate from the exposures, but these tragedies enrich our topics after lunch. We always put our happiness on others suffering. The film told us how to get rid of he shackles of reality, pursuing our own of the free world and enjoying the fair, reasonable real life.",1484870400,,1479,4.710424710424711

Reminds me at moments of a mish mash of Ace Ventura cartoonish faces/gestures along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind style of darker acting. Overall a great film that is standing the test of time for me...and definitely was an eerie foreshadowing of the Big Brother world we live in now with technology encompassing our lives - except now we share it knowingly!",1483574400,2,543,4.494949494949495

If you think this will be your typical Jim Carrey comedy, you're going to be wrong. It still certainly has comedic moments, sure, but the film progressively gets more and more foreboding.",1483315200,,433,4.697368421052632

The story itself has became more relevant in 2016 (age of constant connection), than it was during the films' inception. Jim Carrey delivers an emotional and complex character that is outside his normal range (at the time of the films creation), and he is committed from start to finish. This is one of those movies you truly shouldn't pass up.",1481414400,2,472,4.7682926829268295

980816,4,6305183023,"Jim Carrey has captivated audiences in many movies (The Mask, Ace Ventura, Dumb and Dumber) but The Truman Show is different. Carrey has been known for crazy, over the top characters, and while Truman Burbank certainly falls into that category, Carrey has still found a way to tickle the funny bone when he isn't having a crazy breakdown.

Truman Burbank (Carrey) is unknowingly the star of a TV show that films every second of every day of his life. Everybody around him is a paid actor, including his wife Meryl (Laura Linney), his best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich), and his mother (Holland Taylor). For thirty years, Truman has lived in the utopia Seahaven Island, created by the mastermind behind the show, Cristof (Ed Harris). Truman has never left the island, due to a fear of water stemming from the death of his father when he was younger. Despite of his fear of leaving the island, Burbank dreams of leaving to Fiji because he believes a woman he loved, Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), is there. Truman then starts to realize multiple odd things in his life, and then makes attempts to leave the island.

Carrey is the forefront of the movie, as he is in basically every scene, and even with that, he leaves fans wanting more. His quirkiness and facial expressions will have audiences smiling before he opens his mouth; when he awkwardly interacts with everybody, he will have watchers giggling. When he finally breaks into his classic crazy-breakdown, its hard to not burst out laughing. He is not, however, predictable. He commands every scene that he is in, and keeps audiences guessing what he will do next.

Although Carrey is the star of the show, his supporting cast members have their moments as well. Laura Linney does a fine job as Meryl, and Noah Emmerich adds a nice calming presence to an otherwise outrageous world. Because these actors don't have the screen time or the scene-stealing demeanor that Carrey has, they have to rely more on the script to be effective. Andrew Niccols screenplay is hilarious, making viewers laugh in multiple different ways. For example, because the show is broadcast 24/7, ad revenue is earned through product placement. These purposefully awkward moments are put at the perfect times to create hilarious situations.

The writing isn't the only behind-the-scenes element that is effective. Peter Weir does a great job directing this film, giving us many shots of what the show would look like on TV. He uses many creative places where a hidden camera would be placed, and the blocking of the extras really adds to the ambiance of the world, as they do the same things over and over again, really adding to the thought that this world that Truman lives in is completely fabricated.

The Truman Show isn't complicated, and it doesnt need to be. It shows how effective a comedy can be when actual thought is put into it. The movie is clever, it is smart and punny, and doesnt rely on quick crude jokes to get a laugh. One would think that after the success of this movie, more comedies would follow suit and put more craft into the writing.",1475539200,,3088,4.786116322701688

I watched mark Sargent's Flat Earth Clues on his YouTube channel, and this show is one of the ones he mentions watching, and that is why I rented it in the first place.

He finally figures out what is happening to him and what happens along the way is both hilarious and tear-jerking. The friend who always showed up with a 6 pack whenever he was having a bad time or close to discovering his true predicament makes me want to bash the portion of the screen he occupies with a baseball bat. Yeah he is that conniving. The ending is as satisfying as the movie as a whole. Well worth the watch, over and over and over and over.",1469232000,6,604,4.401785714285714

981528,5,6305183023,"I have always thought that Jim Carrey movies were a bit contrived and the humor kind of stupid, so when The Truman Show came out, I was not all that excited. But I should've been! After being forced to watch it at a friend's house, I see that this is a very pivotal role for Jim Carrey and he executes in perfectly. He is so much funnier as a ""real person"" as opposed to his usual stupid antics (Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber...blah blah blah) don't appeal to me at all. The emotion and the vulnerability he brings to the naive Truman Burbank only improves as the movie goes on. Watching this man crack as the only world he knows begins to slowly betray him and the intensity of his attempts to discover what else is beyond his hidden cage is moving in a way that few movies can convey successfully.
This movie is more than just about watching Truman Burbank find out the truth of his televised life, but it is a stunning portrayal of humanity. Truman's world was created by Christof (the always wonderful Ed Harris) to be what is considered ""perfection."" Christof is like God in the Seahaven world. He makes every choice for the world, including the weather and even Truman's fears...but Christof cannot change the one thing that noone can manipulate--Truman's thoughts. Truman is given the perfect wife, a brotherly bestfriend, a steady job, and a life in a world that exists without pain, sadness, or evil. But the world is a cage. The movie shows that stability is not perfection, ignorance is not bliss, and a life without ALL emotions--including sadness, fear, and pain--could never exist. Even without knowing that he is trapped, Truman feels the need to escape his ""perfect"" life and to see what else there is beyond the utopia that is Seahaven Island. It is a perfect display of our quest for the unknown, unsatisfaction with just mundane existence, and our interest in what normality really is.
When you watch this movie, you will become just like the viewers in the movie who are watching Truman. You will root for him, cry for him, and laugh with (or at) him. His is truly a reality show that I hope that never is created for real...but we ARE humans, so who knows how we'll try to play God next...

There are millions of extras in your movie that you will never meet. Truman had a burning desire to find out the truth, and that's what it takes for us to see through the illusory aspect of our lives.",1444176000,,514,4.244897959183674
982357,3,6305183023,"I'm really sorry for giving it a more freudian/lacanian/marxist read, but it's simply impossible for me not to do so in this film, due to its extremely ""evocative"" nature. The film is about Truman Burbank (yes, ""true man""), a guy who was born and raised in a fictitious world, where every aspect of it was previously arranged for him.

Not only that, but he's also a participant of a reality show, where every aspect of his life is controlled and followed by millions of viewers on a daily basis. So much so that he naively behaves in this world as if he is truly free and autonomous, unable to perceive (and even less to protest) his environs. But eventually he starts to question the world he lives in. He starts having insights here and there that things may not exactly be as he was told.

He is ultimately the subject who is awakening from a long sedative sleep, an induced coma of his active/critical consciousness. It's both poignant and uneasy to bear witness to his awakening, because the eventual discovery of radical freedom is always a painful act/moment. He discovers that, as put by another reviewer, neither stability nor ignorance are enough; that a life without a certain level of sadness, suffering and anxiety is not only impossible, but ultimately undesirable - as any freudian would instantly recognise. But I don't say that in a simply ""masochistic"" way, of course, but only as taking into account certain basic existential paradoxes.

If anything (and as eloquently put by psychoanalysis), we are eternal saboteurs of our own happyness - not to mention how truly mediocre and conformist simply being happy really is (not to be mistaken here by ""personal achievement""). To be happy all the time should not be our ultimate existential horizon - it's not even part of the frame of being ethical! Not one single great human achievement has been reached through this obssession with feeling happy all the time. It simply doesn't enter the frame - and Truman rapidly understands this.

Boredom is also a key component of both a personal and societal revolution, as we're pushed outside our confort zone by it, suddenly obligated (or rather pushed from the outside) to imagine a way out of our disconfort, of our addicted social self-destructive inertia. This is the perfect movie to present sociology students with, as it provides many of those ""wow"" moments, where sudden self-shattering insights about the nature of social life and reality simply emerge abundantly.

An especially crushing moment happens when Truman, by the end of the movie (and moved by a cumulative self-awareness of the illusions which he lives in), is compelled towards discovering the boundaries of this fantasy world - the problem being that even his attempts at escaping had already been planned in advance as an inherent inner transgression. Being a part of a power structure does not only include the way we're normally supposed to act in it but also the wrong ways through which we imagine to escape from it.

Precisely when Truman imagines to escape from this reality controlled in advance, it's when he is included the most within the confines of the ruling ideology. But that's not all. The rather uplifting ending is the truly obscene part. Agreeing with Slavoj Zizek, even though the film travests itselt as the ultimate unveiling of ideology, where every obscure and repressed content finally comes to the surface, it nonetheless promises us a ""true reality"" behind all that controlled universe of finite appearances.

The collective applause by the end should also ring a bell here. Add to that the fact that Truman is supposed to reunite with her woman (reassuring us with the conservative view of a traditional couple) and we have precisely the repetition of ideology under the (false) guise of its own radical liberation. Having said that, the film nonetheless makes us think, throwing at us a big number of things to think about (hence my 3-star rating). We should just reject the cheap, uplifting, conservative and reassuring message of its ending.",1444176000,,4057,4.948604992657856

982360,4,6305183023,"This is a work of genius, the harbinger of reality TV, but something much more profound, because it speaks to the sense that many of us have, that we just might be part of a TV show that millions are watching. How can that not cross your mind when you have been glued to shows featuring  a hero you identified with: how can it not cross your mind that that focal point could be you? In this movie, Jim Carrey plays the same role he played in The  Mask (the mild-mannered parts), only more so. Is it me, or is he just channeling Tony Perkins and the husbands on Bewitched and Paul Lynde (the fatuous smile he gives the people across the street every morning is pure Lynde)? Is not a virginal gay man his default? However you parse that out, the casting of Carrey makes this story a gripping gay tale, which doesn't work very well, because apparently no one associated with the piece built that into the story. Carrey, in effect, swamps the story with his own personal issues when it would have done just fine with its own issues. In spite of all that, this is close to a masterpiece. Maybe it's the greatest anti-religious movie ever made. Maybe it's the greatest film about living vicariously through the famous. Maybe it is the saddest movie ever made about the sense that everyone around you is just playing a part, for some agenda that you don't even know about.",1443744000,,1365,4.434262948207171

Literarily, mythologically, we may note echoes parts of Homer's THE ODYSSEY, namely the escape from Calypso's entrapment on her island and the return to the faithful, waiting Penelope. It is surely a heroic journey motif, one in which the hero begins without much courage and grows into the heroic role.

A genius take on the dangers and lure of reality television, this film by Peter Weir (who also directed the excellent 'Dead Poet's Society') is one of a kind and elevated by an excellent lead performance by Carrey, and a strong supporting role by the consistently great Ed Harris.",1410739200,,632,5.0673076923076925

You'd barely associate the man you see on your screen with the likes of Ace Ventura, Lloyd Christmas, or Stanley Ipkiss.  Truman Burbank is sweet, charming, certainly naive, and unknowingly the world's biggest television star.  This is one of those movie premises that you don't think will work, but it works in this film.  The way this world was built around our leading man to keep him in the dark is conceivably possible, though one has to wonder how the guys behind all this got the money to create this world...it had to cost a few million, or even billion, dollars.  I also thought the casting of Ed Harris as the head producer was a bit odd as it seemed to be a subdued role for him...I'm just used to seeing him in roles where he is able to let the whole room, and the audience, know that he is present and is to be respected accordingly.  To get my point (hopefully I'm making one), watch Con Air.  But Mr. Harris actually did well, even though I wanted him to be more in-everyone's-faces as in his other movies.  But he didn't do badly.  Overall, I liked this film and I'd watch again somewhere down the road.  One nice thing that this movie doesn't do is give a predictably ending right from the first minute...you really can't figure out anything about the ending, so there is a sense of suspense, eve if there's not supposed to be.  It's a good film and actually allows Jim Carrey to show some range in his acting ability...some range...there are still a few, probably unintentional, callbacks to the movies that made him a household name.  But he did good and the movie was good.  A solid four stars.  Enjoy.",1403913600,,1698,4.467532467532467

984050,2,6305183023,"The premise is simple, and has been done before on television shows such as ""The Twilight Zone"".  Truman is a man whose life has been entirely lived on a television studio in an artificial world, and is unaware of this fact, while all his family (including his wife), friends, and everyone else around him are professional actors and actresses.  The program is highly popular with viewers, and Truman is age 30 when the movie starts.

How did Truman end up as he is?  He was an unwanted baby whom Christof, the show's director, built up an artificial world around.  Trouble is, Truman develops the desire to travel the world, and Christof wants to keep Truman inside his cocoon-not only to save his show, but because he doesn't want Truman out in the cold, cruel real world.  Inevitably, Truman discovers the truth about his life.

The big problem is, once the scenario is established, where can the story go?  Basically, once Truman knows what is going on, what can he do but leave?  The later part of the story is rather anticlimactic.",1397001600,,1037,4.685082872928176

Everywhere in cultures around the world it's okay to lie for ""a good reason"".  And we have everything from little inter-personal lies to big, big, horrible violent lies.

984107,4,6305183023,"The Truman Show depicts an interesting and engaging concept. One of my favorite lines is delivered by the show's creator, Christof. The 'cast', searching for Truman after his escape in the dark, is having a great deal of difficulty.
Christof realizes the need for more light on the set and gives the order, ""Cue the sun!"" I love it. ""Cue the sun!"", as only the creator can demand.

Jim Carrey, in my opinion, is a talented actor with the depth to move from physical comedy to the serious subject depicted in The Truman Show. The manner in which he transforms his character from one of innocence into the realization that he's been tricked rings true for all of us. However, once he understands his plight, he makes good. Instead of crumbling he moves on both actually and figuratively. Truman, with trepidation, is not afraid to go out and into a world he does not know. He's excited!",1394841600,,884,4.630573248407643

Not particularly a fan of Jim Carrey but I like the way it gradually seeps into his consciousness that he's but a pawn in a rather ugly set up: his entire life is managed and controlled in such fashion that he doesn't know why certain things don't quite mesh  all for the benefit of a very wide and intrusive audience! He's the subject of the ultimate Reality Show. All the people in his life, including his wife, are aware of how totally he is being used. The movie becomes more and more interesting as he discovers that his life takes place on a large and convincing set that mimics the real world, and that nothing is really as it seems, even his wife. To enjoy the movie you must be able to suspend disbelief and accept that such an implausibly fake world and plot could exist.",1394236800,,853,4.39873417721519

984301,5,6305183023,"Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) appears to be an average person with an average life. He has a steady job working at an insurance company, has a wife, and owns a home in a good neighborhood. However, unbeknownst to him, it is all fake. In reality, his life is a reality television show, the entire town he lives in is a giant television set, and everyone he interacts with, including his wife, parents, and best friend, are all paid actors. The show is said to have a worldwide following. As the movie opens, the show is in its thirtieth year. Truman is troubled as he starts to see cracks in his artificial world and begins to question things.

The acting all around is terrific. Jim Carrey, known mainly for his comedic roles, excels as a dramatic actor as the title character. Also of note is Ed Harris, who plays the producer and creator of the show Christof.

The score of the film is also excellent.

What really makes this film great and memorable is a strong story. On the one hand, the concept of the film is rather disturbing. The idea that a human could be imprisoned for his entire life, enslaved essentially, without his knowledge simply for the entertainment of others is unnerving. It is interesting to note that the film was released in 1998 just before the big reality television boom hit the United States. Some see this film as simply a satire of the genre. In The Truman Show, people watch Truman to see his human emotions and actions even though every other single aspect of his world is artificial and manipulated. Likewise, in some reality television shows, such as Big Brother and Survivor, people are placed in what is actually carefully controlled environments and footage is edited to manipulate viewers. And this does not even count shows that are just secretly scripted.

Others may see this film through the ideas of religion or the human spirit. After all, Truman's town, Seahaven, is perfect. There is no crime or pollution. However, Truman can no longer stand it once he realizes what a sham it all is.

On top of the excellent film, this DVD includes many bonus features such as deleted scenes and a making-of documentary.

All in all, this is great film with a strong story and impressive acting.",1389398400,,2227,4.668367346938775

984559,4,6305183023,"So, I... being late to the party, never saw the Truman show. When I finally did get around to seeing it in 2013, I realized that this show has become the most accurate representation of our current reality.

I mean, back when this movie was made. Who really thought that there would be a time when a camera crew would follow someone around 24/7. From the time they wake up, use the bathroom, until the time they go to sleep. Obviously this movie has gone to extremes, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this happened in our lifetime.

Anyway, should you watch the movie? Let's go into what was good and not so good about the Truman show.

Good:

- Very accurate portrayal of what our reality is like now. When this movie came out, this concept seemed far-fetched. Not anymore.
- Jim Carrey does a great job of NOT hamming it up. He has some moments where he slips into his goofiness, but he plays it straight through most of the movie.
- The acting and pacing is nicely done. There are really no boring moments in the movie.
- The antagonist is very interesting. You can't quite tell if he's looking out for Truman, loves him, or just wants him for the ratings.

My favorite line has to be from Carrey in one of the few moments where he hams it up. ""Is that the best you got? Ha ha ha ha ha! I guess you're just going to have to... KILL ME!""

Bad:

The only one I could think of is that it's definitely dated. As the years progress, this movie will not age well.

I enjoyed the movie and really couldn't find many negative things to say about it. I can't say I ""loved"" the movie, but I definitely did enjoy watching it.",1378771200,,1624,4.25

984640,5,6305183023,"One of my favorite movies is The Truman Show. In the film , the protagonist Truman Burbank is one of the most famous people  in the world, yet, he has absolutely no knowledge of it.  Beginning at birth, his whole life has been broadcast on TV .
 He lives in a town which is inside a gigantic dome replete with an ersatz  beach , ocean and  day and night sky.
 Truman becomes  smitten with a woman who also likes him. She attempts to tell him the truth of the situation , but is whisked away by a man claiming to be her father. The father character tells Truman that she is crazy but Truman's incredulity of his world becomes more and more suspect with the odd observances  seen amongst the actors and the set in the ersatz town. . He eventually tells his best friend that there is a conspiracy going on with him as the target ,and that he , in fact ,is the center of it all . His friend  said the world is a pretty big place to be the center of it all and that if there was a conspiracy  then he  would have to be a part of it and then he lied and told him that wasn't true. .Truman eventually  finds out that  his mother and father and wife are in on it. His ignorance is bliss mindset only holds out for so long . He discovers that he needs to escape to  what lies beyond the confines of the small town  , and also to find  his true love who tried to tell him truth.  The false creator man -god  Christos  even tried  to kill Truman as he attempted to make an escape  on the artificial high seas with a simulated storm .  Truman shouts out to whoever was in charge, "" Is that the best that you got?!""  Before Truman  leaves in the door in the sky he asked his captor , ""Was any of it real?"". The director said, ""You were real , Truman"". Truman exit's the false  world with a big smile,  and his trade mark salutation, "" Good Morning, and if I don't see you, good afternoon , good evening and good night"".
 The story can be seen as a Gnostic myth. The inferior god called a demiurge in Gnosticism is the character  Christos who is the director and creator of the false world . The Archons or his trickster helpers are Christos crew and everybody in his life , including his mother ,father ,wife, and best friend  who keep the conspiracy alive . The exceptions are  the  lady actor , Sylvia, and a few others who sneak on the set who try to tell him of the false world. Sylvia  exemplifies wisdom in the mythos of the goddess Sophia in Gnosticism. She is the fallen one who is also the redeemer. When Truman finally leaves the false infantile world  of the dome he enters into his more mature true self of the world of the  real.
 The Truman Show demonstrates one of the greatest conspiracy against a single human being since the dawn of cinema. The amazing part of it is  that he is able to walk away from with it a big smile on his face.",1377561600,,2839,4.107468123861566

The set-up making us believe that Truman had indeed lived his whole life as part of a movie set was well done, technically. The movie just lacked any sort of emotional follow-through, and by the climax I frankly didn't care whether Truman left or stayed.
I'm a fan of this sort of movie, but this one didn't have anything that a 20-minute short movie would have missed.",1377302400,,507,4.291666666666667

Carrey can do the drama; and Ed Harris is as good as ever! This premise was so current with all the reality shows on T.V. these days.

The commercialization of art, the commodification of everything we see on the screen. The advertisement 'placements'. The diminishing value of privacy and its corollary: the increased value of exploitation.

Carey's portrayal of Truman is phenomenal in its depth and breadth of feeling.  The movie is quite funny and engaging most of the time. And when it pushes its themes to their extreme in order to show the audience what the consequences of these cultural behaviors are, we find ourselves shocked, distressed, and not a little disoriented.

Good movie, once you understand the story line.  I didn't get much out of it when I saw it years ago, but enjoyed it much more when I got a better understanding what they were trying to convey.  It is amazing how this movie represents what has come to pass in our society, in relation to ""reality TV"" and ""big brother's"" role in society.

The Bluray.com knobs that worked there in that timeframe were incompetent as you will ever know. This was another 5 star 'Patton' review where the reviewer of the PQ has no idea what he is talking about in any way whatsoever. Please revisit the site and read their old reviews of those two films, not the Patton remaster, for a GOOD AND HEARTY laugh at PQ criticism gone down the drain.

This is easily one of the worst transfers on the market.

Stay away from this garbage. Who in their right mind puts out a 37Mbps transfer at the top of the heap and then DNRs the living **** out of the picture and uses some old DVD master with heaps of EE for a release? This 'film' looks like straight to video trash on a decent screen. I could not even bare to watch more than 3 minutes of it before it was sent back.

And not only that but add in the fact this is one of greatest films ever made and all I can do is throw up.

Hollywood's finest couldn't give this the time of day. Expect another release at some point. When they did this with Gladiator enough people complained. No go here for the same treatment and that is quite sad. This film should not look like this.

The 2013 release is the same release. Garbage. Expect a 4K release and new transfer within 3 or 4 years.",1368057600,13,1392,4.198501872659176

985273,5,6305183023,"I cannot begin to understand how this glorious film failed to walk off at least with the Oscar for best screenplay (that year the Academy chose Shakespeare in Love, bizarrely). I watched The Truman Show again a few nights ago and was struck by how presciently it predicted the craziness of reality television. Insurance salesman Truman Burbank (a magnificent performance by Carrey) starts to crack up as he suspects his life is a sham and he is being filmed to entertain a mass audience. He wants to get out of his little community and finds his path blocked every time, be it by the driver of the bus to Chicago deliberately wrecking the gearbox or the travel agency with a picture of an airliner being hit by lightning under the slogan ""It could happen to you"". This is a sly film and you need to watch it several times to pick up all the comedy. The script is magnificent and shows us how the other characters in the show - the ones playing his wife and best friend - have an increasingly tough time dealing with Truman's mental disintegration. He is an animal on display and eventually he decides to escape, much to the wrath of the show's God-like creator. The final scene is particularly good and also very moving. It's odd how Carrey, supposedly a slapstick comedian, starred in two of the most inventive films of recent years: the Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which did win the Oscar for best screenplay.",1364860800,,1438,4.599221789883268

But since people apparently having been using this movie as a screen for their religious projections for quite a while, I am going to give my own interpretation. Since I went to college seminary in Miami it fits with Florida. The movie is really about being in the seminary in Florida. You are basically watched 24-7, and yet you are told you are happy and progressing in spiritual growth. Some escape, but others stay in the show forever, getting sicker and sicker.

When your whole world is turned upside down? When no one is who you thought they were? Even you?

This film has so much to say, about the jaded, voyeuristic and shallow nature of human beings, to the potential, strength and innocence inherent in all beings as well. Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, the unwitting star of the show, portrays a great depth beneath his usual comedic flair. Ed Harris is perfect as the controlling, self-serving, dad/mastermind.

The film's length is perfect.  It isn't drawn out and dulled by nonsense scenes that seem like fillers.  The pace is fast but not too fast that you feel like you're loosing out.  I found it to be only mildly predictable as the film went on.

One little complaint would be the far-fetched idea of the show's team working in the ""sun/moon"" in the sky.  They made it entirely too large to be in scale with the show's ""set"" if you ask me.  Other than that, everything is pretty believable for this kind of movie.

This is, of course, not a comedy. One might call it a science fiction film about the media world. A TV producer (Harris) creates a whole artificial world for the benefit of fooling one man, who is filmed from birth to the end (of the film, not his end). He is on screen 24 hours per day for over 10000 days and he doesn't suspect a thing until something starts to feel funny: his dead 'father' suddenly shows up, against the script. A female actor who has left the cast has a heavy flirt with Truman and she is the catalyst of his suspicion. The world wide audience is enraptured by watching the unravelling of the true man's world. Even his escapist adventures turn out in favor of the producer: audiences are glued to the screen.
My conclusion: an intriguing idea, good acting performances from more than 2 cast members, but an imperfect implementation. Maybe it can't be otherwise: the idea is so complex that it can not reasonably be expected to come to a flawless implementation. (E.g. why would Lauren/Sylvia still be able to hang around on the set and get access to Truman if she has left the cast?)",1277942400,2,1385,4.392996108949417

985679,4,6305183023,"The Truman Show

 The Truman Show featuring Jim Carry, is about a guy who lives in a pretend world.  He is unaware that his everyday life and job are not real.  He is also unaware ha the entire world is watching. This pretend world Jim Carry lives in is he perfect place with no crime and everyone is happy all the time.  I thought the movie was very well made and was one of he better movies done by Jim Carry.  After watching it, I thought there were many issues within the Christian world that can be compared to the movie. One is how Christians separate ourselves from the world and make our own.  Another is how Christians raise their children.  There can also be another twist to the movie.  We see that Truman's life is controlled by the producer of the show, Christoff.  He can be seen as a God-figure because has has controlled Truman's life and all the events in it. So there are a few ways the movie can be looked at that I will be addressing.

 In the movie, Truman has what some call the American dream.  He has a house, a wife, and a good job.  All seems to be well in his life.  He has no problems.  This is why, in reality, his life is a TV show.  People find it entertaining that he lives in a separate ''world''.  I think sometimes Christians, especially in our culture, have tried to create our own world.  We separate ourselves so much from the outside world, or reality, that we are blinded by what is really going on in the world.  We try to make Christianity into what so often looks like the world Truman lived in.  We need to face the fact that God has placed us in the world in order to share the Gospel with people that have not heard it.  This means going out into the world where that are many problems.

 Another issue I saw in the movie that could be related to our culture or Christianity is how Christians raise their children.  Truman was sheltered from the outside world.  He did not know what it was like to deal with real life issues.  His life was completely controlled by the producer of the show.  I can see how this relates to Christians because we try to shelter people from the world and control their lives.  I think it's important to allow kids to make their own choices and learn from their mistakes.  That said, it is also important to have a balance of allowing kids to make their own choices and knowing when to intervene and take control.  If we shelter our children from he outside world how will we expect them to be interact with non-believers?

 The last two points I made have many similarities.  The next thing I saw in the movie was different from the above points.  Truman's life was controlled by the producer.  Everything he did was already thought out and planned.  He didn't know why certain events in his life occurred.  As a follower of Christ, I believe God has everything in my life planned, he knows whats going to happen before it happens.  Knowing that God is in control and that I am forgiven for my sins, I know I can experience true freedom.

985680,4,6305183023,"The Truman Show is a pretty good show, but like the security guards who watched it religiously year after year, when it is over you'll ask yourself, ""What else is on?"" It had a High Concept that was executed well--that unbeknownst to Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), his whole life was filmed 24/7 for the ultimate 'reality show.' It didn't really take off for me, though. It was like a big jet airplane taxiing down the runway, looking like it was about to take off, but it never did. Your mileage may vary. I think The Cable Guy was Carrey's Citizen Kane, so that's where I'm coming from. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was another career milestone. Call me a fool, but I think Dumb and Dumber was classic Carrey. I thought 'Truman' was good, just not as good as some of Carrey's other stuff.

What if anything did I like about it? I really liked Natascha McElhone as the woman he wanted, the way her eyes haunted him. Loved how he made the collage of her face from magazine pictures, and kept it as a keepsake. For some reason, she just wasn't in his official script, so she was an excellent symbol of the tragedy that was the Truman Show for Truman Burbank. It's true his life wasn't so bad, but how sad that EVERYTHING in his world was just a phony and fake movie set. Paul Giamatti has a small part that he manages to make the most of. Still, it is Miles away from Sideways. Laura Linney is pretty good as his wife, but she's no Natascha McElhone. Ed Harris is fantastic as Christof, the director of The Truman Show. Did anyone see him in Glengarry Glen Ross?

Holland Taylor, who plays Charlie Sheen's mother, Real Estate Agent Evelyn Harper on TV's Three & 1/2 Men, played Truman's mom. She looked great for her age; almost as good as she did in 1985's Key Exchange. Was that one about Real Estate, too?

Bottom Line is you might want to watch The Truman Show if there was nothing else on, but first check out The Cable Guy and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and maybe even The Man on the Moon.

985684,5,6305183023,"THE TRUMAN SHOW

We as a people seem to be obsessed with watching other people's lives as if ours is not good enough, it is called reality TV. Sure some watch it to see people more pathetic then themselves but for the most part people watch other people because they feel their lives are more interesting. Whatever the reason ther3e was a movie that kind of touched on that type of thing and may give a look into what may be the future of reality TV. Of course when this film was released a lot of people doubted it because Jim Carrey was acting more serious, how dare he. Well to those who thought that I hope they eventually saw this because it really is good, how dare they to doubt.

Truman Burbank is one of the best guys in the world who is loved by all and he gives that love back. He is the most polite and happy guy ever who has a nice life with a wife and best friend who love him. Or so he thought as his obsession with a lost love drives him to question what is real or fake. As he digs deeper and deeper things get riskier because he may find something he really does not want to know. His life as he knows it may have all been planned including his wife. Everyone around him seems to be in on it except the lady he so longingly wants to find. She is the one person who tried to tell him the truth, and as he tries to find the truth and leave the entire town tries to keep him there. It turns out that everything in his life is fake and he is forced to live out his life in this little bubble of a world, his life predetermined for him. A TV producer who adopted him as a new born has created a whole world around him and made him grow up there. It really is one of the most interesting films I have seen because this film may truly happen.

Jim Carrey is absolutely brilliant in this dramatic comedy showcases both sides of the actor all in the same film. The film does have its comedic moments especially the first half of the film but it is the dramatic stuff were Carrey truly shines. For those who have not seen this he truly gives an award winning performance in my opinion. There is a scene in particular that really shows the pain and struggle of the character. In this scene he appears to be beaten when his boat reaches the end, it is a short scene but it is great. He shows excellent range in this film because up to this point in his career he was truly looked at as just a comedian.

Ed Harris as always is excellent and is brilliant in the lead villain role of a TV producer who wants nothing but ratings. He will go to any lengths to make his show a success and any lengths to keep Truman inside his world. Harris is perfect in this role even making him seem human at times. Laura Linney plays his wife in this film and is great, bringing life to a role were she is an actress, love it. Noah Emmerich as well is great in the film as his best friend; Paul Giamatti and Adam Tomei also are good as assistants to the producer. Everyone in the film do a great job as people who are all actors, I wonder if that was hard.

Written marvelously by Andrew Niccol this truly is a great film that mixes a perfect balance of different types of films. I can find moments for comedies, dramas, action, suspense, even horror because to be honest it is like one big Twilight Zone story. This film could have been a straight up comedy or a complete drama or even a really darker film, and all of them would have worked even with the same cast. While all those would have worked I happen to like the film director Peter Weir gave us. I highly recommend this movie because I have always enjoyed from day one. Skip the rental and buy this like I did, I think any movie goer will appreciate this film. Also there is an excellent and very in-depth behind the scenes feature on here.",1264896000,3,3789,4.1287262872628725
985685,5,6305183023,"The Truman Show, though funny at points, deals with a serious theme. Like Plato's Allegory of the Cave, this film deals with a similar situation with a modern twist. The film is the epitome of America's obsession with reality television. The film was released when shows like Survivor and Trading Spaces were conquering the airwaves. How far could reality T.V. actually get? The Truman Show, undoubtedly, would be the result.

 The film deals with Truman, a man that was abandoned at birth and was adopted by a television corporation. His life was turned into a TV show as he grew up in an artificial town known as Seahaven. Its creator is Christof, who oversees the day to day pseudo-reality of Truman's life. In many ways, he represents the ultimate modern man. He calls himself ""the creator,"" but unlike God, his creation is all artificial. The entire TV show revolves around Truman, and the only way to make this possible is to have absolute control of Truman's surroundings. This not only includes the town in which he lives, but the people he comes in contact with, and even the weather itself is manipulated to fit the desires of the shows producers, depending on the mood they want to set for a specific episode.

 The cost to obtain high ratings comes at a heavy price - Truman's freedom. From the moment of his birth, his future was already decided for him. Everything from his job, his wife, and even his father's death, was all scripted. He doesn't even have the freedom to be with the one he loves most. In the film, he falls in love with Sylvia, who at the time was playing her role as Lauren. As time passes, he tries to seek her out, and when he finally does, they meet secretly in a beach where Sylvia tries to tell Truman that his life is a T.V. show, but before the message was able to sink in, Sylvia was taken by another cast member to keep her from revealing the truth. Off the show, Sylvia continues to fight the producers of the show by making phone calls, persuading them of the immoral and dehumanizing effects of the show. Truman's longing for Sylvia was his ticket to freedom. During the course of time, since his separation from Sylvia, Truman begins to piece together cut-outs of magazines by taking eyes, mouths, noses, ears and hair from different models to create the image of Sylvia's face. Explicitly, this image represents his longing and love for Sylvia. Implicitly, however, the face he created is the face of freedom. In a sense, Sylvia, for Truman, becomes Lady Liberty. Like immigrants arriving on Ellis Island, the first face Truman would see once he is free from his bondage would be the face of his Lady Liberty, Sylvia, who at the end of film rushes to greet him into the real world.

 Truman's main journey in the film is the discovery of truth. Similar to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Truman must search beyond his surroundings and day to day routines to discover the true nature of his identity. These people and surroundings he comes in contact with constitute his own shadows. These shadows are his world of ""ordinary things"" (Plato's term for the lesser physical world), but if he is to discover the truth of the real world (""world of forms""), he must step beyond his own cave and into the natural light.

 It is man's curious nature which leads him to wonderment. One of my favorite moments in the movie is when Truman asks Christof: ""Was nothing real?"" Christof tells Truman: ""You were real."" Truman was the only one in Seahaven who was authentic. This, thus, brings us to the notion of authenticity and inauthenticity. In many ways, Christof was right - Truman was the only real person. Even Christof himself was not living an authentic life. He had fooled himself into thinking that he was some type of god who can control people's lives. Truman desires freedom so much that he yells out at Christof: ""If you want to stop me, you'll have to kill me!"" As Truman fights for his life. amidst the raging storm, an employee implores Christof to cease the storm. He tells him, ""You're going to kill him in front of a live audience!"" To this Christof indifferently responds, ""He was born before a live audience."" Christof has played the role of God so long that he lost his own authentic identity and created for himself an artificial one.

 Another similar and interesting character is Meryl, the actress that plays Truman's wife. Not only is she a puppet of Christof, but she sells her body for higher ratings.  She tries to persuade Truman to have a child with her, which would undoubtedly have the same fate as his father (not to mention safeguarding the show's longevity). There's no doubt that Meryl would have received a great bonus if she were able to conceive a child on live television. The moral applications to this would be absurd. The meaning of sex would be reduced for the sake of higher ratings. In many ways, this could be considered a form of human trafficking. When Truman refuses to have a child, and Meryl leaves the show, the producers are forced to hire a new actress to play the role of Truman's love interest. It's as though they were hiring a prostitute with an acting degree. All this trouble for the sake of becoming the first television show to feature the very first live conception.

 At the movies end, Christof, in an attempt to persuade Truman to stay, tells him that the world ""out there"" is the sick world. He tells him that by staying here in this artificial world he can provide safety. Ultimately, however, Christof cannot control human freedom. He may have seemed omniscient by having cameras all over his artificial world, but as Truman so emotionally put it: ""You've never had a camera inside my head."" Truman's desire to be free and authentic leads him to say those famous words he often repeated one last time, officiating the end to his inauthentic career: ""In case I don't see you, good morning, good afternoon, good evening and good night.""",1264723200,5,5937,4.653625954198473
985686,1,6305183023,"Oh, that I could be so lucky as to have Truman's life. Not only does he get to break the spell of consumerism with which we're so bewitched, enslaved by, really. In Truman's ""reality,"" there really is somebody behind the controls and he's actually a very sweet man. The wizard, in fact, is not a munchkin gone power-mad, but just a down-on-his-luck fellow stuck in a box for so long that the touch of a woman is but a distant, stained-glassed memory.

Everybody Loves Truman! What's there to complain about: Are you trying to tell me, Mr. Weir, (you, whose hippie-dippy ""The Mosquito Coast"" found Han Solo getting preachy, stuck in some frozen-in-carbonite jungle planet dreamworld), that we don't all want to be superstars, gawked at by every living human breathing thing? Do I instead want to discover that my life as an empty consumer chaneling my techno-slave ethics is merely due to somebody pushing a series of buttons behind the temporal screen? And I can forsake that and go meet my merry, beret-encrusted maker in Booth 33. And once ultimately in heaven, to then sit on a gooey cloud and weave tinkles from a 150-pound solid gold harp forever and ever and ever.

I would much rather talk to you through my shaving mirror, wittious, without restraint, oh so very amusing in my ""innocent"" ways. Forrest Gump teams up with The Prisoner in this hapless, ""Thelma & Louise"" for the manly man's soul. Tarzan with a twinkle in his eye and a gymnastically inclined eyebrow and a tie hanging from his neck, a robotic Gomer Pyle spreading bland cheer like a throat coughs up the bubonic plague. Blindfolded ministers riding hamsters through the dark alleys with roses in their teeth, forest fires in their hearts.

Saddest of all is how, with nary a quickened pulse, we demote the role of a human to a laboratory animal as a form of wholesome entertainment. No wonder we're going to hell in a ham basket, folks.",1262304000,,1909,4.709580838323354
985687,5,6305183023,"From the opening interview with Christoph, the creator of The Truman Show, where he very quickly and rather arrogantly states: ""Yes, It is staged but it is not fake"" I was hooked.  Gott in himmel (god in heaven)!, what could that possibly mean?  I suppose Cristoph the creator and producer is telling us that, even though every aspect of Truman's life is staged, his reaction to the scripted events are real.  While he may have a point it occurred to me that perhaps Cristoph could predict within a fairly specific range of possible reactions, how Truman might react to a particular stimulus.  So are we all being played?

What do we learn from the masses who are watching Truman's life as it unfolds?  Do they see in the scripting of his life, how scripted and mundane their own lives have become?  Do they yearn to break free from the yoke of routine, of sameness or do they, in fact, find some comfort and safety in routine?  How will they react as Truman discovers the truth about his life?

985753,5,6305183023,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ""BLU RAY"" VERSION OF THE FILM***

Watching Peter Weir's 1998 film in 2009 is a weird and wonderful trip - if not a slightly disconcerting one at times.

First - it's as masterful and brilliant as you remember it - a very clever unfolding story about a man whose life is permanent Candid Camera for the entire planet - living in an artificially created world with literally everyone around him being an actor. Then there's the stunning and believable performances of a perfectly picked cast (Carey, Linney and Harris all shine). And second - with the appalling Big Brother polluting our airwaves night after night - ""The Truman Show"" is not just relevant eleven years later - it seems to have actually predicted our television future...

But back to the BLU RAY - the first thing you notice is the picture, which is a mixture of beautiful clarity one moment running alongside very steady DVD quality the next. Clarity highlights would include - - Noah Emmerich's sea of freckles as he's interviewed in the opening credits - he plays Marlon who is supposedly Truman's best friend - always turning up with a ""Brewsky"" whenever there's a problem (they actually cake and paste Noah's face with make up to cover up his freckles in later shots). There are the pearls on Sylvia's wrist in the library when Truman and her finally talk, the ""How Does It All End?"" button on her cardigan - stunning clarity. There's Truman digging the garden in his horrible orange pants as his wife stops on her bicycle for a little product-placement (played superbly by Laura Linney)...
""Look Truman! Chef's Pal! It's a Grater, Dicer and Peeler all in one!""
""Wow!""

You also notice the actors who went on to be huge stars, Paul Giamatti as Christof's technical sidekick, Peter Krause from Six Feet Under and Dirty Sexy Money as one of the suits in Truman's office and of course the ethereal beauty of Natasha McElhone who has eyes clinically proven to be deeper than the Pacific Ocean.

Harry Shearer is in there too doing a fantastic turn as the appeasing interviewer Mike Michaelson. There's the crass reintroduction of Truman's dead father, which is being choreographed live by manipulative experts in the overhanging control room (quote above). But the trump card is the last minute cast appointment of Ed Harris as the show's all-powerful creator - the aptly named Christof. Harris is simply magnificent (nominated for an Oscar) all serene and quietly spoken one moment - but dictatorial the next when his little money-making baby and power trip start to get challenged by an unexpectedly spunky Truman - a man Christof's personally trained to be scared of certain things so he won't ever leave Seahaven...

The two extras are the same as the Special Edition DVD - so a little disappointing there. But that's minor compared to how good the whole film looks on BLU RAY and especially how amazingly well it still stands up - a modern day masterpiece. And the scenes where Truman stops the bus in defiance and where he battles the storm on his boat trying to break free brought tears to my eyes - fabulous stuff.

""You can't get any away further away before you start coming back..."" Truman says to Marlon about Fiji where his longed-for love Sylvia is.

It's slightly disconcerting to find a movie character spouting such wisdom, because in 2009, our entire world feels like one big screwed up reality show that can only end badly...

What a film! And a triumph on Blu Ray - Recommended.",1245888000,5,3491,4.75702479338843

Ed Harris as the director, almost a father figure.  He cares, he wants this show to work, but he gets intensly involved in Truman's life.  And a former girlfriend who leads a Free Truman activist group.

The coordinated 24 hour a day life of Truman start coming apart when a studio light falls from the sky, closely followed by his father unexpectedly showing up.  Oh my gosh!!

The ending was satisfying.  No spoilers, you gotta see it. It really gets funny when he tries to be unpredictible and the studio attempts to stop him at every turn.

985757,4,6305183023,"In another of my retro reviews,I thought I would return to one of Jim Carrey's best performances in The Truman Show.
By now everyone knows the story of Truman Burbank(Jim Carrey) and his life which is viewed by people worldwide 24/7/365. There has been a live feed of him since his birth and the audience has viewed him at most every waking and sleeping moment he has had. He lives in a carefully controlled micro and macro environment. Everyone from his parents to his closest friends to his teachers are all fake;fake in the sense that they are all actors portraying certain parts in Truman's life. The entire city he lives in(Seahaven)is in a protective bubble and everything from the weather to the traffic to the changing of the days is controlled from the outside. Controlling every last detail of this vast project,and ultimately Truman's life,is Christof(Ed Harris).Beside's the enormous responsibility of Trumans' life,he has the TV network and it's ratings to figure into the overall equation. It is quite the balancing act.
Now at age 30 Truman starts to suspect something is just not right. He sees a man that he swears is his ""father"" who is suddenly whisked away. A set light drops from the sky onto the road in front of his house. He is detecting patterns in everything from his neighbours,to traffic to his place of employment. His curiosity and testing of his suspicions start to throw the perfectly choreographed world Christof has created off the comfortable perch it has been on for so long;and he and his staff are having a hard time keeping up trying to predict what he will do next.
Truman knows he MUST get away from the city by any means he can. He must escape and by escaping hopefully find the answers he seeks. In the films climax it is a battle of wills as Truman sails his boat away from the city with Christof conjuring a massive storm threatening to kill Truman. He almost succeeds but Truman barely scrapes through and sails his boat to the edge of the domed world. Truman walks out along a ledge and up a staircase to a doorway through which he escapes and into the ""real"" world.
Carrey does such a good job of portraying just the right emotions at just the right time;such as when he faces down his own wife and his best friend knowing what they must think of him for raising doubts,but all the while deep inside knowing something is not right and that he must carry on no matter what.
The movie works on so many levels simultaneaously;as reality TV to the extreme;an experiment in psychology and physiology;a micro and macro study of human development in a controlled environment with controlled stimuli;it even has it's theological threads as Christof literally plays God over Truman's entire life with even part of his name,Christ,emphasizing that fact. Truman is in a very real sense Christofs' Adam!
Whatever level(s)you view this film on it still remains one heck of an entertaining film with a unique and different vision and story to tell. I think it is one of if not THE best performance by Jim Carrey to date,in a more serious vein. This role really challenges an actor to have a great depth and understanding of the part in order to properly emote at just the right moment and still staying true to the core of the character. Jim Carrey made it look effortless and I commend him for his talent and ability in that regard.
The DVD picture is crisp and clear and is available in D-2.0 and D-5.1 surround sound. Special features on this DVD include:A two part doc on the making of the Truman Show,one on the visual effects of the movie,four deleted scenes,photo gallery,two trailers, and two TV spots.
This is a movie that is a win-win all the way around. Jim Carrey gives a career cementing performance with this role while Ed Harris follows a close second with his portrayal of Christof. Director Peter Weir walked quite the tightrope with this script but managed to reach the other side unscathed;quite the feat considering the depth of the material he had to handle. It has been about eleven years now since its' inital release and it still holds up excellently.
This is a definite must have movie!",1236729600,,4145,4.68724279835391
985807,5,6305183023,"Well, this is a definite favorite of mine. The film itself, that is. If you like Jim Carrey in not-as-funny-as-dramatic movies, like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, you'll love this. If you just like his comedies like The Mask and Ace Ventura, well, this might not be for you, but worth a look. It's not necessarily a comedy, obviously a drama, but a bit of a laugh every once in a while. Even being dramatic, it's still a very enjoyable movie, and his performance is great. I've read some comments where people say ""I don't see why people love this movie so much, anybody could play Truman Burbank,"" and, well, that's just fantastic, but they didn't, so why moan about it. Anyway, as for the movie itself, yes, it's great, I absolutely love it.

Moving on, the Blu-Ray. Welp, I've had a rather up and down experience with this. It's one of the better Blu-Rays of 10+ year old movies, that's for sure. Occasionally it gets really grainy, kind of DVD quality, but that's hardly consistent, only in some shots, and kind of makes sense as those shots are usually supposed to be from tiny, bizarrely placed, hidden cameras. That being said, it does get annoying going from a crisp picture to all of a sudden DVD quality, but overall the quality is great. The audio is great, as well. Compared to the DVD, you hear more things, and crisper, as well. Things like the waves, the sound of cloth, sighs and all those little things just sound better. The special features are rather disappointing, unfortunately. The trailers seem horribly unfitting for the film. The scenes taken out are, for the most part, uninteresting(which makes it obvious as to why they were taken out), but also in standard 640x480. I don't fully understand this entire ""Make the movie 1080p 16:9 and the special features 480i 4:3"" thing some studios are doing, but this Blu-Ray has that. Not that it bothers me too much, I bought this movie on Blu-Ray to enjoy the movie itself.

Would I suggest this to anyone? Mmm, maybe not ANYONE, but anyone who's able to grasp the main idea of the movie. Some of the people I've shown it to didn't quite understand what the main plot was. So, I would only suggest this if you understand the main idea or point first.

If you've decided on buying it, but don't know if the extra bucks are worth it for the Blu-Ray over the DVD, I can only say yes. I won't get technical, but there's really no way an upconverter can give as good a picture as a real blu-ray, too much is forever lost in translation. Buy it on Blu-Ray. You won't regret it.",1235260800,3,2549,4.5249457700650755

985812,5,6305183023,"The first time I saw The Truman Show, I was hooked. The movie is highly critical of the media and of how reality is manipulated to entertain the largest group of people. I have always been critical of the way television shows always claim to distribute ""reality"" to the public, and The Truman Show exemplifies many of the reasons reality television is so highly criticized. Truman, played by Jim Carrey, is an engaging character whose life is displayed on camera for the world to watch. He is surrounded by actors hired to interact with him and inspire the emotion that makes Truman so interesting to watch. The emotions and actions of the actors aren't real, so though they are believable, Truman's emotions and actions cannot be real either. Truman is floating in a nave sense of truth. This movie illustrates how though we may believe that what the Television is flashing before us is reality, there is a truth much different from what is displayed on the screen; and we should be critical enough to see the real truth for ourselves.
 Truman Burbank is the focus of a television show that began with his birth and subsequent adoption by the TV studio. Every aspect of his life is on camera, and there are thousands of cameras that follow every action from various vantage points. While he is growing up, going to school, and getting married, he is being watched. He is watched as he leaves his actor/wife to go to work in the morning, and watched as his actor/best friend hang out with a six-pack of beers. It all seems so quaint and real but the truth is that his life is a sham.  His wife isn't real, she doesn't even like him, which he finds out by examining their wedding photos and finding that her fingers are crossed during their wedding kiss. His best friend Marlon isn't real; instead of being a true friend Marlon is used to manipulate Truman into certain frames of thought. He takes advantage of outings to hit some golf balls  to convince Truman to stay put on his island instead of going to Fiji for a vacation.
 Not only are the characters used to influence Truman's sense of reality, but the media in his world as well. The  radio station creates a convenient explanation for the equipment which falls from the sky right as Truman is walking to his car in the morning. According to the announcer, a plane accidentally lost equipment that morning, causing the invasion into Truman's world. Truman's ""father,"" who was killed off the show in a boating accident designed to make Truman terrified of the water, somehow manages to get back onto the set and disturb Truman's life. Seeing a man who is supposed to be dead alive once again is a big deal, and quite a shock, especially when random strangers appear out of nowhere and take the man away with no explanation at the time. The explanation comes from the newspaper which spins the incident into an issue of cleansing the town of homeless people and from the woman playing his mother, who claims that she ""sees"" Truman's father in every face on the street. Truman remains unconvinced, he knows what he saw for himself.
 These events set off a chain reaction of discovery in Truman's life. He realizes that he is being followed when his radio accidentally picks up the frequency broadcasting the transmission from actor to actor. In an effort to discover some truth, Truman goes against his routine and visits the building next door to his, and sees people sitting at donut-laden tables where an elevator should be. After being dragged from the building he goes to see his wife, Meryl, at the hospital where she works. At every turn he is conveniently blocked by some obstacle or another and he cannot get into the operating room where she is performing ""surgery."" He attempts to fly to Fiji but is told by the travel agent that they are booked up for a month because it is the ""busy season."" When he tries to take a bus, the bus breaks down, and when he tries to drive away with Meryl, he runs into bumper to bumper traffic, a bridge over the water that terrifies him, a forest fire, and ultimately a nuclear meltdown which forces him to stop the car. When Truman tries to run, he is tackled by men in tinfoil suits and dragged back to his home.
 All of these obstacles are the design of Christof, the creator, designer, and omnipotent watcher over Truman's life. He is responsible for every person Truman sees, every word they say to him, and every challenge he faces. He observes Truman from his studio in the moon and engineers heart-wrenching scenes with a frightening genius. The best example is probably the return of Truman's father, who is reunited with his son in a dramatic scene involving fog, various camera angles, and synthesized music all coming to a climax as Christof orchestrates the camera to a close-up as Truman embraces his father and sobs, ""dad!"" These are the scenes that drag the audiences into Truman's life, drawing on their sympathy and awe. They accept  the reality as Christof presents it to them, drawn by the intrigue to watch more. Christof lets them see what he wants them to see, his story, and the audience blindly follows along. They either don't realize or choose not to see the reality of Truman's situation. His emotions and actions are being manipulated in the exact same way as theirs are.
 It's too perfect, this scene and the entirety of the show Christof creates. When a caller on a talk show claims that Christof has turned Truman into something unreal, he replies, ""I have given Truman the chance to lead a normal life. The world, the place you live in, is the sick place."" I fail to see how his manipulations are any less sick than the terrible place he is protecting Truman from. His claim that he is ""protecting"" Truman reeks of protecting his interests as a TV show director and protecting the fan-base he has established with the show. He limits the information given to Truman and blocks his ""star"" from exploring the world outside his own, claiming that if Truman ""was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him."" It seems that preventing Truman from discovering the truth is his sole goal. At the height of the film, Truman's life is a battle for the truth fought between him and the force he has found working against him, though he still doesn't know who he fights.
 The stage for the final battle is set on the sea that separates Truman from the rest of the world. His desire for the truth is so strong he overcomes his terror of the water and attempts to sail to freedom. Christof sends him a storm complete with thunder and lightning and gale force winds. It is incredible that this storm is the result of two conflicting ideals, the seeker of truth and the keeper of the truth. This idea goes beyond mere reality TV and broadens to all media and even the government. It is easy to correlate the huge body of the government or the body of the media with Christof, the manipulator of the information and the figure who decides who hears and knows what. Truman is the people, the ignorant populace who is at first nave and complacent but fierce in his desire for information once the ball is rolling.
 Here is where the relationship between Truman and we the populace ends. We have not yet found that drive for knowledge, the real and true knowledge. We are just like the viewers of The Truman Show. We are still absorbed in the forged reality of the story and have not yet broken through the silver lining to the bare bones of what we are seeing. Truman should be our icon for reality and his drive should be our drive. Truman knows that the world outside his dome of illusion is different and new and unexpected. He may be afraid to step outside the door but what truly matters is the journey to get to the door and the realization that there is a door in the wall.",1225929600,4,7831,4.582441113490364
985813,5,6305183023,"The concept behind `The Truman Show' is more pertinent to us today than it was when the film was released.  Sure, the idea of television controlling the world is not a new one, but in a world where every new television program is another take at the reality genre it becomes more and more probable that an event such as this one may one day take place.  The opening words by the shows creator say it all:

""We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions.  We are tired of pyrotechnics and special effects.""

With that said, `The Truman Show' begins.  The film tells the story of Truman Burbank, the only non-actor in a world filled with actors.  He is married to an actress; his best friend is an actor; his high school teachers and current employer and seriously everyone around him, from his mother to his late father to the person that happens to walk by his house at precisely the same moment every morning.  The thing is, Truman doesn't know this.  He actually thinks that his life is legit, but what he doesn't comprehend is the fact that everyone in the known universe is watching his every move being projected onto their living room television set.

Yes, Truman is the star of his own reality show; a reality show he is unaware exists.

I remember watching this film when it was first released and I was merely thirteen and I felt that the film was boring and unentertaining.  Because of the misinterpretation I stayed far away from this film for years, only recently entertaining the notion of watching it once again.  My feelings the second time around are vastly different.  `The Truman Show' is a marvelous study of the effect that television and the media in general has on each and every individual, and the damage it can do to ones psyche.

The acting here is beyond good, especially when in regards to the star of the whole show; Jim Carrey.  Many have said that this is a career best for Carrey, and I think I may have to agree (although he was beyond superb in `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' as well).  He brilliantly captures Truman's naivety and his destructive curiosity once he starts to put the pieces together.  Laura Linney is wonderful as Truman's wife Meryl, contrasting her faux perfection with her genuine dissatisfaction with her actorly existence.  I was not entirely blown away by Ed Harris (the only Oscar nominated performance in the bunch) for I felt that his performance was not a very difficult one.  He pulls it off, sure, but there wasn't much to pull off here.  Supporting players like Natascha McElhone and Noah Emmerich are also wonderfully complete and add layers to each and every scene.

What I love so much about `The Truman Show' is that it stays true to the concept in every aspect of the film.  There are product placements throughout the entire film, and they pop up in the most ridiculous manner, which adds light to the idea that television is steadily controlling our every thought and action.  The script is brilliantly fleshed out, creating real characters with real problems and real concerns.  Weir's direction is amazing, visually captivating from start to finish by using techniques (with camera angles and placement) that create an air of reality within this faux reality.

This is what makes television worth watching.",1221523200,,3305,4.734265734265734
985814,5,6305183023,"I like this movie alot; I like Jim Carrey as a serious actor and as a semiserious one.  He is an incredible actor.  The story gives one pause to consider what if my life had been entirely staged, scripted, and was on display 24 hours a day.  Yikes!",1221004800,,248,4.125
985815,5,6305183023,"For me to give a 5-star rating to any Jim Carrey movie, before I saw this 1, I'd say you'd see the sun rise in the west first; or see Bush become a Christian!
Very very small-the ending, kind of leaves 1 hanging; especially with Natascha's character when she rejoices over Carrey's choice and throws on her coat and runs out the door, where's she going? To him?
But for what the movie is and attempts to accomplish, BRAVO x 1000. To qualify, for people who are not into a surreal brand of movie, without question, avoid this one!
Ed Harris' character Christof? Like Carrey's, bravo! A little malevolent, at the end when he tells Truman to choose to stay; is it love, or control? Masterfully played! And Laura Linney, always outstanding. Natascha McElhone? First roll I've seen her in but, as with Harris and Carrey, very poignantly played!

Some of the philosophical questions attacked, interestingly enough, are issues, and choices, America is contending with today.
What is it we're seeking? security, with the known and totally controlled, or the adventure of the unknown, freedom, and exploration?
How do we define sickness? completely controlling a human being's life for ratings, or the rest of the world itself gone completely mad with rising crime and a government we don't seem to be able to control any more, and an apathetic spirit which chooses to just disengage?
Is it sick/wrong for the network or corporation or whomever it is to claim ownership over Truman, in an obvious capacity, when in a more invidious one we delusionally call ourselves free today at the same time government has virtually reduced us to slaves?
What is it Goethe says, ""None are more easily enslaved than those who call their slavery freedom""? Truman's mistake-discovering the game; when are we? If you like movies like ""V For Vendetta"" you'll like this 1 too.

It gives him the chance to really shine as an actor, combining the comedic and the dramatic to get an extrememly likable character. Its his best role, in my opinion. And, honestly, he is the reason to see this film because I don't think it would be as interesting with another actor. I really liked the soundtrack to this film as well, it was very moving at times. The rest of the cast also did a fantastic job. The utopian scenery blends in perfectly into this film and makes it all the more interesting.

985841,5,6305183023,"Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of the most elaborate reality television show possible. His entire life, from birth, has been televised live for over thirty years. He lives in a small island community that is actually a giant stage established for his benefit by the show's creator, Christof. Truman has never known he is the subject of a show, he is not an actor, just an insurance salesman living his life. Every person he knows, on the other hand, is an actor and acting out a script. His mother, best friend, wife, co-workers, all of them are there for the show and nothing else. The problem is that Truman is getting island fever and wants to leave. He also begins to suspect that something is wrong and that things in his life are fake somehow. His ""loved ones"" try to reassure him, but he's determined to keep pushing.

The Truman Show challenged a lot of viewers in 1998 because Jim Carrey's presence seemed to promise a comedy similar to his most recent hit at the time,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liar-Liar-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783235070/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liar Liar (Collector's Edition)</a>. This is not a comedy, however, but a drama with a bit of humor to break the tension. If you can get over waiting for Carrey to really busy out the zaniness, then you'll appreciate both the movie and what may be the finest performance of his career. The humor is still there occasionally, but so is a vulnerability that he has rarely exhibited. The supporting cast also turned in strong performances, led by Ed Harris as the tyrannical Christof who regards Truman as his personal property. Noah Emmerich, as best friend Marlon, is also noteworthy as the warm-hearted best friend who isn't what he seems.

The Truman Show is not like any movie made before or since, and that alone makes it noteworthy. It was far ahead of its time in portraying the phenomenon now known as reality TV before even the first season of Survivor was a hit. It has a few funny moments, but mostly this is a story of a man who hungers for more in his life and feels trapped at every turn. It's Truman against the entire world he's trapped in and who among us has never felt a touch of that?",1199577600,4,2236,4.850785340314136
985842,4,6305183023,"The Truman Show is one of those movies which takes an initiative, trying to be different and introspective. It is often labeled as a comedy, but I don't know if there is a real category that defines this film (it is part comedy, part drama, part ""reality"" show). However, I think one of the more important perspectives of this film is simply the morals projected: that free will and creativity make us who we are, that no one has the right to suspend our freedoms, and that diversity and change are natural in life and that attempts to take these away from individuals stifles one's ability to live. Truman has had ideas that everything in life isn't as perfect as it seems, and he is right. When he catches on to these, he truly begins to try to live, and push back the limits that have restrained him. Although the movie takes a very simplistic premise, the idea that Truman Burbank has been pretty much living a television show from birth, it works because its subject creates debate. Far too few films provoke any kind of reaction like this one; people should have an opinion about movies after they view them, and The Truman Show delivers in this perspective.

One of the drawbacks is that some of the characters are a little bit too cut and dry. Take Christof, the director of the show, who is presented as an evil egoist who only wants ratings, and will not stop this idea of ""reality TV"" even when Truman is onto this idea. His character was a bit too simplistic. Not everything in this movie works, and sometimes the acting from characters is as phony as the world that Truman lives.

It's a thought-provoking film though. It clearly makes one think about the possibilities and power that media sometimes has over individuals. How much do we really want to see and know about someone's life? What is ""crossing the line"" as far as personal space? The paparazzi could take a lesson from viewing this film. This movie was made before reality television really took off, but it really fits into this world because it presents the idea of taking away ""personal space"" and privacy. Truman's momentous life events are all a part of the American home, including the moment he ""lost"" his father, and the moment he regained his father. Many reality shows have individuals ""perform"" each episode and these individuals do this because they choose to. Truman Burbank's character is the very opposite of this spectrum; he doesn't have this choice, and takes measures to break from this.

The concept of the movie is unique, and is certainly applicable in today's world. Definitely a movie to check out, then go back to later on!",1198800000,7,2623,4.660907127429805

985900,5,6305183023,"The Truman Show became Peter Weir's sixth project in the States and could be arguably, his greatest work since the beginning of his career. Working alongside New Zealander Andrew Niccol, this appealing, likeable and self-panning satire just occured, prior to the big boom of reality television. The title, The Truman Show is known as a play-on-words, since it is supposed to be poking fun and putting him in deep scrunity at the same time. His name, Truman Burbank is a pun. Truman really is an apprevation of True Man and Burbank is the name of the famous Warner Bros studio lot, hence the town in the studio he lives in.

Truman Burbank is an ordinary man, unaware of his existance twenty-four hours a day on an American television channel, broadcast around the world on a so-called inhabitated island called Seahaven enclosed in a studio complex. Burbank slowly unveils the truth of life on the island when a camera falls from the sky.......

The Truman Show was a strange project for Jim Carrey, but one that suits his physical crazy-man style of comedy, so many favours. You can understand why Carrey took a part like this which relates to his personality through little clues more than anything else he has done. His performance as Truman Burbank reveals him to be a man who experiences restrictment from the time he was very young in many forms seen so vividly. Carrey makes him invisiable and skeptical. Laura Linney is brillant as his commerical engrossive all-50s American housewife. Noah Emmerich protrays his best friend, Marlon, who reministic of their childhood memories and his obbession to keep him safe always, don't prove to the answers nor the person, Burbank thinks he is looking to up and should trust. Christof, the rarely seen reclusive creator comes across as a distinct loner, prone to angry stares and shows a lack of humour. Also, note how the personalities on screen, are just minicks of the real people, who couldn't care less about the main attraction.

Peter Weir's direction shows the view of the world; the sudden close-ups; the cheesy humour and repetitive behaviour as well making Christof's studio seem fascinating, but very domineering and grey. The editing work gives an appropriate parrallell life towards Truman's eyes and the world in which Christof lives in as well which emphasises the main themes of lonliness, reclusion, the media's intrepretion and self-esteem.

The Truman Show is a candid look at an over exaggerated idea, that people know ""could"" never prosper, but with the things that reality television is capable of doing like trapping people in a forest or house, we may never know what the risks they are more than willing to achieve for audience interest.",1186704000,3,2711,4.951648351648352
985901,4,6305183023,"The Truman show was filmed in beautiful Seaside, Florida.  Great place to visit if you get a chance.

The movie is a pretty obvious metaphor for religion.  A lot of people live their lives believing that their version of ""God"" created them, and in a sense watches over their lives the way Christoph (coincidence about the controlling character's name? I think not) does Truman's life.

Truman realizes something ain't right several times.  In the end, he stands at a door cleverly hidden in what he has always thought is his reality.  The door is marked ""Exit"".

The message is that it's OK to exit your religion.  You can still believe in ""God"" in your own way, but there's a complete reality waiting for you that isn't defined by your life long religious belief.

It's up to Truman (and you) whether to continue in the relatively safe, but maybe fake reality, or find a true reality outside of ""The Truman show"" or religion.

The sign of great acting is when you really, really care about the character.

This is a film with many layers. The casual viewer will enjoy it for its oddball humour and quirky characters. At a deeper level there are parallels for how we as human beings live our lives. There is a innate hunger for feeling alive. Joseph Campbell said that we're mistaken when we think we are searching for meaning. Meaning is your head, its intellectual, but feeling is the whole body. And Truman through his escapades is searching for that feeling of being alive. And there is a girl that was removed from the Truman Show in his youth that drives his magnificent obsession. He gets thwarted by the omniscient Christoff, brilliantly played by Ed Harris, the creator of the Truman Show. And this eventually leads to a face-off which is one of the most spiritual moments ever recorded in cinematic history. The ending of this film almost always brings a tear to my eye because I can feel Truman's pain and his hunger for more. More than what's visible, more than what is allowed.

985905,5,6305183023,"The 1998 film The Truman Show (directed by Peter Weir) narrates the life of Truman Banks (Jim Carrey), who is unaware that his entire life on the island of Seahaven is completely constructed by a TV crew, and is part of a constantly running reality television program called The Truman Show, watched by millions 24/7 world-wide.  But when Truman comes to realize that something is strange about his world, he makes plans to escape his artificially manipulated universe.

The premise is a clever one, and the film succeeds on the level of story alone.  But what's particularly of interest to this reviewer are the profound philosophical and religious questions that the movie seems to ask.  Not only does it raises age-old philosophical questions common in the field of epistemology, concerning what we can know about reality (e.g. could I be deceived about what my senses and experiences are telling me about reality?), but it also appears to explore many deep religious questions by means of allusions to Christian themes.  Consider how the TV producer Christof (= Christ of) is the ""creator"" of Truman (= True Man), and functions as a god who controls his world.  The symbolism seems too strong to ignore, and as a result, particularly in Christian circles where this imagery cannot go unnoticed, there is considerable debate about the worldview behind the film, and whether it is intended to portray an atheistic or Christian worldview.  Reviewers typically fall into one of two camps:

a) those who see it as a secular film, by portraying the Christian God as a cruel and harsh dictator who operates a deterministic universe from which we need to escape by rejecting God.  According to this view, Truman's liberation is a depiction of the Fall, and promotes an atheistic lifestyle of rebellion against the Creator and an escape from Eden.  Others have tried to be more charitable by interpreting it in line with Calvinistic theology, suggesting that the film depicts the tragedy rather than the triumph of sin, but this is implausible in view of how the Creator is portrayed negatively and how the final liberation is presented so positively.

b) those who see it as a criticism of secularism, by suggesting that Satan creates an artificial world for us, from which we need to escape by converting to the truth.  According to this view, Truman's liberation promotes the need to escape the deception of Satan (the anti-Christ), and exchange it for a life lived in service to the true God.  Some have even seen it as giving a positive message about Christianity, for if Seahaven represents an illusionary man-made Paradise, then Truman's decision to leave this old world behind is symbolic of a conversion experience, and he represents a Christ-like figure who models the way of salvation.

The first view interprets The Truman Show as a story of the Fall, where Christoff symbolizes the true God, and Sylvia (who encourages Truman to escape his ""world"") is a serpent-tempter figure that brings rebellion.  The second view interprets The Truman Show as a story of Redemption, where Christoff symbolizes an anti-Christ, and Sylvia is an intercessor that brings freedom in contrast to the Judas figure Marlon.  Proponents of both views have engaged in considerable debate over these two interpretations, the former which sees the Truman Show as a secular existentialist film, the latter which sees it as a pro-Christian film.

Certainly the rich symbolism in the film lends itself to an interpretation which gives the Christological imagery throughout the film a more important meaning than mere allusion.  But neither of the above explanations is entirely satisfactory or consistent.  Because how can Truman be a rebel who rejects God, and at the same time a Christ-like figure (he is depicted as crucified in the boat, and at the end walks on water and ascends into a stairway of heaven)?  And how can Christoff be representative of a deterministic creator, and at the same time an anti-Christ?  A consistent allegorical interpretation fails in its application, and should already be a hint that one is not intended.

Perhaps the best solution is one which is neither overly critical nor overly charitable with respect to the Biblical imagery, but sees this as subordinate to other themes about the media and television, without forcing a simplistic choice demanded by a polarized approach.  Director Peter Weir has gone on record in more than one interview that the film is about television.  Weir is of this conviction: ""My attitude to television, personally, is too much of it is a bad thing.""  According to Weir: ""And that's really at the heart of what the film looks at in a major way - this disturbance to our perception of reality, as a result of the immense entertainment and actuality coming at us, to the point where you can't differentiate anymore. News programs that are entertaining; video everywhere."" Given Weir's remarks, I believe that the Truman Show is essentially a sharp criticism of the dangers of a false reality cultivated by the media, and a warning against losing our sense of reality.

Clearly Weir has chosen to portray the director Christoff as a creator figure very deliberately, but he does not use this image to push a religious agenda, but to give a social commentary about problems created by the modern media, which blurs the lines between appearance and reality.  In that regard, his analysis of television is spot on and speaks to our time: to what extent is our perception of the world the result of manipulation by the media?  And do we need to be liberated from the artificial reality of a TV world and return to the real world?  I see this explanation (advocated also by Andrew H. Trotter) as more plausible than one which sees the film as a simple spiritual allegory, or which interprets it as an indictment on reality television (note that the release of the movie predates much of the contemporary fascination with reality TV shows).

In short, the Truman Show is defending neither an atheist or a Christian worldview, but it merely employs Biblical themes and allusions as servants to its real theme and social commentary about the media and television. It has to be conceded that both Christoff's and Truman's characters have clear Christological symbolism, but the film is ambiguous about which of the two is to be identified as the Christ figure simply because it doesn't want us making a choice between them.  Although the religious symbolism is too strong to ignore, in the end it is subordinate to the more central theme about the role of television and media in our culture, and is a means to an end rather than an end in itself.  Consequently in my view, it's a mistake to see the film either as an attack on Christianity, or as a tool for evangelism.  That's not to say that the film doesn't raise interesting parallels on a religious levels - certainly it can stimulate interesting discussion both about how God the Creator watches over us (cf. Psalm 139), as well as how the Satan the father of lies deceives us.  Ironically, the Truman Show has created its own deception - while appearances suggest it is a spiritual allegory, a closer look suggests that this perception is merely an illusion. - GODLY GADFLY",1171497600,16,7267,4.914963205233033

985970,5,6305183023,"I remember my brother coming back from the theatre after seeing this film. I asked him how it was and he said he and his friends hated it. They expected the usual Jim Carrey film with him giving a over the top comedic performance. I still couldn't wait to see it and still found it to be a great movie. I thought Carrey was about as goofy as any of the villians in the  Batman 60's series when he played the Riddler. I always thought he'd be a better actor if he took his medication lol. Here he must've took it since he gives a more laidback and heartfelt performance.

  He plays a man who was filmed on a set without knowing for his entire life. His whole life was scripted with him not being able to do things that he really wanted to do his entire life. He wants to sail across the ocean. So they had him sail with his tv dad and faked his death so he'd be afraid of the ocean. The girl he really wanted to be with wasn't even allowed to be with him since it wasn't in the script. Since she trys to tell him that his whole life isn't real, she gets rushed off the set never to be allowed on it again. A actress on the show played by Laura Linney gets shoved in his face so much that he eventually marries her.

  This isn't the usual hyper-active look at me I'm Jim Carrey and I'm funny comedy. The film is funny on it's own without him trying a little too hard to be funny like he usually does. For instance it's funny how everyone advertises products as they're talking to him. Like when he's having a heart-felt conversation with a buddy of his, he'd be advertising the 6 pack they're drinking. Or his wife advertises what they'll be eating.

  It's a clever comedy with Carrey letting everyone around him act without trying too hard to steal the show from them like he usually does. He gives a smart performance where you can tell he's thinking and knows that everything around him is a little odd. While in other movies he talks so much that you'd think he doesn't even take time to even use his brain lol. When Carrey gives a sensitive performance that actually shows he can act he gets ignored by the Academy and by his fans who just wanna see him go back to talking out his butt. It's sad though because this is a really good performance that he deserved credit for. At least Ed Harris got a deserved nomination as the selfish creator of the Truman Show who would rather see him dead than have him escape and...destroy ratings and the show.",1153612800,8,2453,4.233404710920771
985971,5,6305183023,"A truly original and moving film, with the combined talents of Australian director Peter Weir (Master and Commander, Witness) and Andrew Nicole, (Lord of War, Gattacca, Simone) with his exceptional writing ability, The Truman Show hit the theatres across the board with dazzling critical acclaim not seen in the industry for many years.

Andrew Nicole is an exceptionally gifted writer. New Zealand born, trained in London, making commercials, he travelled to Hollywood submitting his Truman script. Evidently the film execs told him that Truman was at least an $80 million project and they could not and would not attempt to sell a first-time screenplay to the studio. He went back to his little apartment and penned, Gattacca, a story about a future dystopian world based on the potential horrors of a society organized by way of genetics'...for less than $40 million. He directed Gattacca that ended up making more money than anyone, including the studio execs, ever dreamt.

Consequently, The Truman show got the green light, however, again, the studio could not invest their dollars into a one-time director and screenplay writer, Nicole. Peter Weir finally, after hours and days of deliberation, got the job and pre-production began in earnest.

Jim Carey at that point in time had only played over the top comedic roles. A real genius in many respects, he jumped whole heatedly into the character of Truman, revealing his range of talent as an actor. The character, Truman, represents everyman, an individual evolving as a ""product"" of his environment, the media and the sheer power of advertising.

Since Truman's conception he has been the focus of millions of television viewers. For over thirty years, the TV viewing public has seen Truman move through his life. This ""Reality"" show had become a multi-billion dollar industry, as advertisers clamoured to be seen, until Truman's perfectly constructed world begins to deconstruct and everything falls apart.

Everything about this film is astounding: cinematography, creating camera angles never seen before in conventional film. The sets, Seahaven, could be any town across the world. A beautiful soundtrack from Phillip Glass and Truman's perfect wife, Meryl, (Laura Linney) a quasi ""Stepford"" wife from the fifties. Truman's best friend, Marlon, (Noah Emmerich) was outstanding as Truman's childhood friend. The entire cast and crew contributed to this wholly remarkable story about our modern world.

The most interesting character has to be Christof, (Ed Harris) the man responsible for the `The Truman Show', an egotist, a self-realized god-like individual who would rather see his ""creation"" live in his artifice than the ""real' world. Harris won many awards for this role that were all well deserved.

Truman's wife, his best friend, and the Almighty-like Christof are diabolical, cash-driven thieves of a good heart and gentle soul. They will stop at nothing to keep Truman in their sick version of ""REAL"".

Sure, Carrey does manage to pull a couple of wry laughs-which are truly profound statements of his growing disgust with his created world. We laugh, even as we're crying as Truman learns of the nature of his life for thirty years.

Jim Carrey is brilliant in this largely-overlooked film, and those of us who looked beyond his capabilities as Fire Marshal Bill certainly realize this. There is no one else who could have portrayed Truman Burbank so perfectly.

985974,5,6305183023,"With its (all intentional of course) cheerfully colorful cinematography, cheesy music and one-dimensional supporting characters, it's easy to miss just how brilliant The Truman Show is; it's in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990's, at least as important as darker films like American History X and Fight Club, and one that works on several different levels. Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the post-modern age, in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow, it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind.

For Truman's story is man's story; and it's difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters. True Man's life, the film says, is an illusion, a lie. Or perhaps - all our lives are illusions, but the True Man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth. In its essence the point is very similar to the one The Matrix made; The Truman Show is a fascinating trip through Plato's Cave, and while it takes a rather simplistic look at Plato's philosophy - because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours - it doesn't dumb it down. The Truman Show is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time, and can be discussed for hours.

Writer Andrew Niccol - who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite Gattaca - lost the Oscar that year to the Academy's favorite Shakespeare In Love, and director Peter Weir got most of the credit for the film; but while it's certainly an important achievement for Weir and the best film of his long career, it's Niccol's sarcastic, intelligent, innovative script that made The Truman Show great; that, and the amazing performance by Jim Carrey, who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time. Carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman Truman, and we're as fascinated with him as the show's fans in the film. Praise should also go to Ed Harris, who plays Christof, creator and director of The Truman Show (and again, special attention should be given to the character's name) - and also to Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natasha McElhone, Harry Shearer, Peter Krause, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast, both in Truman's world of Seahavan and in Christof's `real' world. Finally, a word of praise for the excellent musical score, composed by Burkhard von Dallwitz and the great Philip Glass, which compliments the film's atmosphere to perfection.

The Truman Show is not an easy movie to absorb; it's a disturbing tale and a disturbing message, which takes some time to seep in, and while it's entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as sci-fi, and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man, it's also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value. Truman's character is irresistibly charming, and just like the people watching The Truman Show, we believe in him and identify with him completely. The beauty of The Truman Show is that it's lots of fun; it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals. By being entirely entertaining and gripping, it gets its messages across a whole lot better.

The Truman Show is now eight years old: the way I see it, once a decade has passed, a film can begin to be considered a classic. The Truman Show will pass that test. In any possible aspect, The Truman Show is one of the absolute best films of the 90's, and one that will remain relevant long after reality TV has bitten the dust.",1143676800,12,3706,4.723338485316847

Rated PG for thematic elements and mild language.

Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the most famous man in the world, and he doesn't even know it. Raised entirely within a television show which comprises his entire world, Truman is an Everyman for the post-television age. Truman's world, ""Seahaven"", is an Eisenhower-era model of American bliss, recalling the prison-like Port Meirion and the moral certainty of Bedford Falls (""Its a Wonderful Life""). Surreptitiously filmed around the clock by 5000 hidden cameras, the show exists inside an enormous geodesic dome with simulated weather and even its own ocean. Through a series of production blunders Truman slowly realises that he is being controlled and that perhaps all in his world is not as it seems. His surrogate father by proxy, Christof (Ed Harris) the producer/director, goes from being benevolent social scientist to evil genius as his attempts to frustrate Truman's wanderlust become more and more deadly.  Truman becomes rebellious, trying desperately to escape his existence. More importantly, he is in love with a girl named Lauren (Natascha McElhone), who he met in school, but was taken away (She tried to tell Truman the truth).  In search for his one true love and the truth behind his life, Truman is taken on a whirlwind of experiences that are capitvating beautifully on screen.

Director Peter Weir, who is emerging as one of Hollywood's most talented directors, plays the disgust element regarding Truman's situation strongly. He also provides an interesting portrait of the media and television industries, part satire and part thoughtful reflection, yet it's hard to believe the 'thoughtful reflection' side when all audiences watching Truman's show seem to be characters straight out of a satire (ditzy restaurant waitresses, a cackling man watching from his bathtub).  We can't take these characters seriously enough to reflect on what they represent in our society. Nevertheless, Weir maintains a firm directorial hand throughout; his pacing is superb, and his choices of music are, as usual, unexpected, refreshingly different (droning scores in the background reminiscent of 'Dead Poet's Society'), and completely succeed in beautifully complementing the film.  Weir is no stranger to casting comedic actors in dramatic films, he evoked a similar performance out of Robin Williams in ""Dead Poet's Society"". Here, he manages to morph Jim Carrey from playing the role of Truman as a straight out comedic role into playing a real person, who has the occasional comic moment. Besides being refreshingly subdued, Carrey also turns out a brilliant and consistently watchable performance, which is lucky, since his character in the film parallels his character's role on the TV show. The entire picture revolves around Truman, and Carrey carries the film with ease. It comes as a let down then, when Carrey lets himself drift ever so slightly over the top at parts, when Truman starts to go hysterical, believing people are following him.

The supporting cast is less developed, also paralleling Truman's TV show, where characters seem to simply float in and out, never really connecting with the lead. The character of Truman's wife, played by Laura Linney, is hastily and sloppily written out of the story, leaving more room for a developing romantic subplot (which, mercifully, is only taken to a certain level) between Truman and a former 'cast member' (Natascha McElhone) whom Truman believes is the only woman he ever loved, and who, in turn, has developed feelings for Truman. But McElhone has one of the flimsiest characterizations in the film, despite how pivotal her character is, only really getting the chance to stare anxiously and complain about how this treatment of Truman is wrong. It's nice to see cameos from Harry Shearer as yet another news anchor, and Paul Giamatti as a show technician, but most of the acting support comes from Ed Harris' masterful performance as Christof, the man who orchestrated and directed virtually every aspect of Truman's artificial life. Harris is spellbinding, overshadowing every actor present except Carrey himself as the character stubbornly refuses to come to terms with the moral issues of his hit TV show.

In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current ""reality TV"" obsessed culture. Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do). The universe does not revolve around us. In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic ""childhood"" existence.  A giant leap for Carrey, and despite some of its enigmatic flaws, ""The Truman Show"" is an enduring, emotional, and humorus film with just the right touch of charm.",1135900800,3,5272,5.156908665105386

I wouldn't go as far as to say that it is thought-provoking or philosophical, because it goes way beyond Orwell's 1984 to the point of absurdity. I would say that the serious side is more like a mystery or a thriller - you sense that something is very wrong, but you don't know quite what until later. But in a way this movie did presage the growing lack of privacy and even the television phenom of ""reality"" shows. I really liked the concept of the artificial city in this film.

986029,4,6305183023,"""The Truman Show"" is an entertaining movie with a clever premise and a poignant theme.  Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances as he downplays his usual silliness, and instead gives his character depth and three-dimensionality.

Carrey comes off as funny and loveable while he doesn't try so hard to make us laugh.  Laura Linney is excellent as his TV wife.  But Ed Harris, while a fine actor, seems to be not much more than a caricature of a director rather than a real person.

The mid-section of the film could have been trimmed a bit; scenes where the actors and the director are interviewed break the film's momentum, and the pacing is slow.  The movie sometimes shifts awkwardly from light comedy to intense drama, but it's still very intelligent and compelling to watch.",1129593600,4,784,4.770370370370371

When Truman is escaping for the first time and the flash that fire on the road and THEN when he passes that they have those guys with giga-counters or whatever out there saying everything is radioactive.  When Truman is at the travel agent's office and there's that picture of an airplane being struck by lighting that is captioned ""IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!""  When Truman goes into that building and sees the fake elevator and then leaves, smacking the electrician on the bottom with his briefcase as he learns that if he does anything unscripted that people pretend it didn't happen.  And how can I forget the part where he hears them play-by-play tracking his morning route over crossed signals on his way to work and almost hits that lady with the umbrella.  I could go on, of course, as this film is FILLED to the brim with stuff like this that is only amplified with Carey's personality which is ideal for this character really.",1129420800,,1188,4.488372093023256
986032,4,6305183023,"Beware of spoilers here:

This film is totally enjoyable.  Once again Carrey shows that he is capable of serious acting and not just the goofy stuff.  He really is a wonderful talent and I still continue to wonder why he did so many of those toilet humor movies.

The premise of the film is fresh and entertaining.  In these days of reality television can a show like this be too far off in the distance?  I think not.  Here's the premise.  Carrey plays a poor unsuspecting soul named Truman.  He was an orphan who was sort of adopted by a televison show producer.  His whole world is fake.  His parents, his wife, best friend, neighborhood, job, etcetera.  The weather, the sun, wind, rain.  All fake.  Everyone in his world is an actor.  Even his town was a set.  Cameras were hidden everywhere.  The whole world watched Truman as he grew up.  His first steps, his first day at school.  Everything.  Can't you just hear Hollywood's wheels turning as they try to figure out a way to make this happen one day?

The Truman show is such a hit that people in the real world have trouble functioning and living their own lives because they can't stop watching it.  It's on 24 hours a day.  There's the premise for reality t.v. Are we really so bored with our own lives that we have to tune in to watch what's going on in someone else's family?

Truman starts to notice little strange things around him.  A light seemingly falls from the sky as he's on his way to work.  The radio announces that it fell from a plane but we know that it was one of the studio lights.  He also pines away for a girl that he never really had a chance to have a relationship with because the network already had a wife planned for him.  They can control his world but they can't remove his memories.  He also he a desire to travel but he lives on an island (or so it seemed to him) but he has a paralyzing fear of water because he saw his father drown in a storm at sea.  Actually, the father was fired (from the show) and the station decided to kill him off.  The man who played his father slips back on to the set one day and Truman sees him before the actors who play security guards and cops hustle him off the set.  Things start to fall apart for the show after that.

Laura Linney plays Truman's make believe wife.  She plays his wife strictly for the cash and fame.  Ed Harris is excellent as the producer/director of the Truman Show.  He feels like he is Truman's real father since he's the one that's been taking care of him all of his life.

Things finally come to a head and Truman has sort of a showdown with his creator.  I won't say what happens but when the transmission of the Truman Show is cut, what do the folks that have been watching faithfully for years do?  Turn the channel to see what else is on.

This film raises some interesting questions.  Should we make a person's life a subject for our own entertainment?  Can we really be so disinterested with our own lives that viewing someone else's  life fulfills us?  Just how far will the entertainment industry go to make a buck?

To those of you who are not Jim Carrey fans, I urge you to give The Truman show a try.  Yes, Carrey is still a crazy, zany, rubberfaced guy but his range of acting abilities is remarkable to say the least.  There really is talent inside that brain of his.

There is no sex or violence to speak of here.  It's okay for young children although the concept could be difficult to grasp.  Enjoy!",1128297600,4,3469,4.294117647058823
986033,4,6305183023,"Nothing demonstrates the remarkable range of Peter Weir, who made the adventure film ""Master and Commander,"" better than the simultaneous DVD release of special editions of ""Witness,"" a culture-clash thriller, and ""The Truman Show,"" science fiction until reality TV surpassed it. Is there no genre this Australian director has not tried? An anti-war polemic? ""Gallipoli,"" with newcomer Mel Gibson. The supernatural? ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" based on a true incident. Coming of age? ""The Dead Poet's Society,"" with comic Robin Williams in his first serious role. You name it, Weir has done it, and done it extremely well.

How fortunate for comic Jim Carrey to have had Weir to tame his rubber-faced antics in his first serious role. The coincidence does not minimize the talent that Carrey exhibits in ""The Truman Show"" and the sensitivity with which he exercises it. His lead performance was among the finest in its year not to be nominated for an Academy Award, and seeing it again on DVD only magnifies the slight. Truman lives an ordinary life under extraordinary circumstances: he is the clueless central figure, from birth to the present, in a popular reality TV show in which his home and town are settings and his wife, parents, co-workers and best friend are actors.

Ed Harris is the eerily competent director of the show within this show. His assistant is nicely played by Paul Giamatti, who also was slighted by Oscar for his 2004 lead in ""Sideways."" The details and dynamic of the subterfuge, involving logistics and product placement, and how the show deals with Truman's awakening to the truth, are fascinating. As actors playing his wife and friend, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich have funny and moving exchanges with Carrey, whose genius is not to be denied. His other forays into film drama have not been as successful as this truly original work. Its gorgeous musical score is by Philip Glass.",1125705600,,1913,4.993730407523511

For, like Truman, we are all pressured to pursue that which society imposes upon us, no matter how empty it may seem; as if some heartless eye is indeed watching our every move, directing our very lives for the sole purpose of selling soap.  But... if only we, too, could span the lake in a daring sailboat voyage, and reach the edge of reality on the other side, to discover god and a true purpose.  Perhaps, we can.  Perhaps this hero's journey is our own.  Let us learn from Truman, and not simply change the channel at the end, vapidly.",1124841600,3,824,4.466666666666667
986035,5,6305183023,"Before the absurd reality shows took the airwaves by storm, director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol imagined the world of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Adopted and placed in a soundstage build to resemble a small American town Seahaven, Truman discovers that his life is nothing more than a TV show full of product placement. Truman discovers his friends, family and the world he lives in is nothing more than a construct. The first clue occurs when a flood light used to illuminate the massive soundstage where Truman lives falls into the middle of the street.  When Truman wants to leave the small town he lives in and go to Fiji the TV show that is when his life begins to fall apart. Although Weir didn't write the film it deals with a subject common to his films; an individual who literally is an outsider in his own world. It's also about deception. Truman like most of Weir's protagonist discovers a web of deceit that corrupts his own world.

A brilliant film that finds Weir (""Witness"", ""The Year of Living Dangerously"", ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"") in top form, it's amazing that this Oscar nominated film didn't pick up Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Writer and Best Director it was that good. Instead, the Academy rewarded ""The Truman Show"" like it does any film made by a Hollywood outsider-with a few awards recognizing the brilliance of the film and then settling into sublime mediocrity for the rest of the awards. There are clever visual references to Patrick MacGoohan's ""The Prisoner"" TV series woven into the visual motif of the film.

Featuring a stunning anamorphic transfer, ""The Truman Show"" looks nearly perfect. Paramount has done a terrific job with this new edition. Colors are vibrant and bright and the image quality is amazingly sharp and crystal clear. The 5.1 sound mix makes nice use of the format with imaging placed around the speakers.

We get a two part documentary that can either be played separately or as one. Weir, Carrey, Lara Linney and Noah Emmerich appear in interviews in the documentary. Curiously, the only person missing is writer Andrew Niccol. I'm not sure why Niccol doesn't appear in the film (perhaps he wasn't happy with some of the changes that Weir did but they work brilliantly). The fact that it closely resembles elements from Philip K. Dick's ""Time Out of Joint"" is also not addressed as well. The two part documentary runs about 40 minutes. The first part of the documentary focuses on the genesis of the film and some of the changes that occurred before the film was shot. The second part of the film focuses on pre-production through critical reception. This includes information on the wealthy beach community Seaside, Florida that DIDN'T want them to shoot there.

We also get four deleted/extended scenes that provide additional information and background on the story. While they aren't essential, they are pretty fascinating to watch. There's also original theatrical trailers, TV spots and previews for other Paramount releases.

A terrific film that was overlooked at Oscar time for far lesser films, ""The Truman Show"" catches Weir and his collaborators in top form. It's ironic that 10 years later the ""reality show"" world that was predicted came true (although not on this scale). The transfer looks terrific and the extras are certainly superior to the previous release on DVD. Definitely worth purchasing if you are a fan of Weir's work or just this movie!",1123977600,81,3435,4.913793103448276
986036,5,6305183023,"I guess this is one of those movies you'll either love or hate, and it's not because of Jim Carrey in either case.  I loved it, my mother hated it.  It's like a twilight zone episode with a lot of flare and humor.  It works on different levels, depending on how you want to take it.

As a comedy, it's not one of Carrey's funniest, but consistenly amusing, with a bit of dark humor, some even morbid.  However, there's enough of an upbeat tone throughout, chiefly due to the music and Carrey's mere presence, to keep it from being classed a dark comedy.  If you want you can read more into it, perhaps an allegory for the shells we build around ourselves, symbolism for phoniness in general, or something like that.

If you know the premise, it kind of spoils the surprise and the intrigue of learning what's going on along with the main character, Truman (Carrey).  So I won't go into the basic premise here, in case you haven't seen it or heard about it.  Instead, basically here's what you'll learn in the first part of the movie:

Truman lives with his wife in an ideal, suburban-like island community.  Truman's never left the island, his occasional attempts repressed.

From Truman's point of view, strange things are happening, usually with pat explanations that comes a bit too late to ring true:

The reappearance of his father, presumed dead; an elevator door that leads from a swank lobby to an unfinished room full of surprised looking loafers; voices on the car radio discussing his own whereabouts and movements; etc.  It becomes enough to make Truman paranoid, and to believe everyone is in on some kind of set-up at his expense, even his wife.  You'll see more than Truman does, evidence that he really is being spied on - by this time in the movie you'll probably know exactly what's going on, but the fun is in seeing Truman, initially baffled by the clues, gradually figure it out.

One of the more imaginative sequences involves Truman gradually creating a picture of a girl he met in high school and never saw again.  He tears out different pieces of magazine pictures of women's faces, and pieces them together like a puzzle.  This is symbolic of his gradual discovery of what's really happening to him.

If you don't like The Truman Show, I imagine it's because the premise doesn't seem to be plausibly presented. To me, that's part of the comedy.  It's also helped along by an outstanding performance by Ed Harris (The Right Stuff, Milk Money, Enemy at the Gates) as Christof, the guy behind it all.",1123632000,3,2523,4.63963963963964
986077,5,6305183023,"Literally it was ahead of common place ""reality TV shows"" that pathetically envelopes our television today.  The concept at the time was original with a sensational sense of theatre.

When I first saw this film on a trip to LA I had an inkling of what genius lurks in Hollywood.  This film combines major issues like relationships, romance, scripts, big brother and ""Middle America"" at its proverbial finest.

Perhaps this is Carey's best film and he plays a sincere guy getting clued up to his true situation when he meets the love of his life, played I understand by an English actress.  She was gorgeous.

From then, it's about finding her and escape.

The humour and lines are so unforgettable.  Truman's wife advertising Mococo coffee beans from the mountains of Nicaragua.  Shows you what suckers we viewers can be ...

The plot is fairly simple and very memorable, being about a man whose every day life is like a TV show. He doesn't realize it but he's always being watched and everyone he knows is part of this TV show. But the difference is that they know that they're part of it, while this man, Truman is completely unaware and doesn't know that everything that he does is being watched. He's basically on FOX everynight on ""the life ot Truman"".

Jim Carrey once again is great but the difference about this movie from his others is that it isn't a comedy. This movie is a drama, a comedy, a family movie, etc..

It is produced very well and believeable. The acting in itself is great because part of the time the actors are simply acting as if they're acting. I know it gets confusing, but that's how it is.

Basically, there's this guy who's lived his whole live in this 'fake' world. Everything around him is basically a movie set. The whole city. He begins to notice over time, and he tries to leave, but cant'. I wouldn't ruin it for you, but that's the basic premise.

I had a chance to see it last night with my 12 year old son and I enjoyed it again.  It has the rare quality of being a movie that can be enjoyed by people of different generations.  If you don't know the story, that's all the better.  The movie does an excellent job of filling us in on what's what.  We get a lot of the basics during the opening credits, see some of the ""show"" and get more helpful information as we go along.  The many role players that we see on the screen reinforce the idea that we, too, are now watching the same Truman Show that they are seeing.  We come on board at the time that Truman finally starts to figure out that things aren't what they seem to be.

The way the movie lets us see the ""acting"" in the actors, the coordination of the technical staff, the quick reactions to unforseen changes in Truman's behavior all help to make the movie that much more enjoyable.  It also gives us a sense of the shallowness of the program itself.  That point was amplified when we get to meet The Truman Show's creator played by Ed Harris.  Certainly a large element of this movie is a poke at the nature of television; what we like to watch and why.  By corrupting the old adage ""truth is stranger than fiction"" we are led to understand that the human interest shows on TV merely take time away from living our own lives.  What is really strange is how television on so many channels these days seems to sense that ""The Truman Show"" was a harbinger rather than a satire.  We now find out way more that we should need to know about people who voluntarily place themselves in positions that require that them to bare their humanness.

I thought about rating this movie a ""5"" based on its' originality.  However, I stopped short of that because I thought it ended before it had the chance to explore other possibilities.  Yes, there is only so much time in a movie to say so many things that simplicity is a virtue.  Nonetheless, I felt that the movie failed to fully challenge the potential of its' unique concept.

986084,5,6305183023,"""The Truman Show"" is a masterful collaboration between director Peter Weir, scriptwriter Andrew Niccol, and star Jim Carrey.  Though seemingly light in tone the film makes an ominous statement about our voyeuristic society even at the most mundane.  Niccol in his other projects has taken a fairly pessimistic view of society in his masterful ""Gattaca"" and the underrated ""SIMONE"" but ""The Truman Show"" is his most powerful indictment of human nature yet.  The film concerns Truman Burbank(Carrey) a rather affable fellow who lives a blissful life in the town of Seahaven with a seemingly perfect wife(Laura Linney) until he comes to the realization that it's all been a lie.  His entire life has been concocted by a television director, Christof(Ed Harris) and that his friends and relations are all paid actors.  Naturally, Truman's impulse would be to escape such an existence but there is too much riding on him to stay on the air and Christof will use all of his Svengalian powers to keep him in place.  Carrey gives probably his most effective screen performance to date evoking not only the comedy inherent in his role but also the pathos.  Harris, in a role that probably should have won him the Oscar, nearly steals the film as Christof.  His arrogance at Truman's attempts to escape from his power and the petulence he displays is masterful.  Linney is also effective as Truman's wife with the perpetual smile fixed on her face knowing full well that the cameras are on.  Natascha McElhone is also good as the woman who wants Truman to escape his stifling existence.  Great film but Paramount shows no respect for it by packaging it with virtualy no extras no speak of.",1107907200,2,1679,4.876760563380282

Besides my astonishment that Jim Carrey could actually act seriously (and brilliantly, at that), I was so riveted by this film's tragic beauty that I recall sitting on the edge of my couch, frozen in the same position during the entire last hour.  Years later, I regret that I can never watch ""The Truman Show"" for the first time again, but I can appreciate seeing new details every time I view it.

The key quote of this film, I think, comes from Christof: ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.""  Just think--just stop.  Think about that.  Just for a second (though preferably longer--it's not easy to wrap your head around).  It hearkens back to the oldest philosophical questions known to man: why is there anything at all, and why are we here?  Jim Carrey allows us to look through the eyes of someone whom we fear we are, when we stop to think in those dark moments of life.

Everything about the end of this film is hope.  Sure, sometimes we feel now as Truman did when his boat finally reaches the end of the stage.  We beat, pound, and rage against that which keeps us from reality.  Like Truman, we struggle to the point of exhaustion and finally turn our backs, slide down the boundary, and try to reconcile ourselves to this shadow of life.

These shots (especially the very last one where 2 viewers wonder 'what else is on') are not just to close the film in a funny note. They're not scenes that the screenwriters just decided to include for fun. Far from that, they are a very bitter and pessimistic closure to the film, a portrayal of the reaction that the viewers (of the movie - not JUST the viewers IN the movie) will unfortunately have: after watching the movie they will just look for something else to 'consume', having missed the point they will casually look for another movie, another of what they just had: another movie to pass time. The majority will find it to be nothing but a movie about a reality tv show.
 Those scenes are a bitter comment on how most people will just fail to grasp it's real message. And it actually prophesised what followed after the movie came out, which is not a big surprise, really.
 Some people will actually manage to read between the lines, though. It's the same people that managed to understand the subject of movies like 'The Matrix' (not those who think it's about jesus) and 'Dark City' (not those who think it's about... aliens), the ones that understood what those movies tried to project. To those people all three of these movies talk about the same thing although adopting different storytelling methods to address it.
 The Truman show is the one that deals with the subject in the most down-to-earth and accesible fashion: by looking more 'realistic'. By looking ordinary compared to the others. And yet it is so more obvious for it. Sadly, most people don't think when they watch movies unless they are told they must do so.
 What is the common link between 'The Matrix', 'Dark City', and 'The Truman Show'? Could there be more than just that all three were filmed in Australia around the same time? Sadly (or perhaps not) there is absolutely no point in revealing what viewers should discover themselves - it will be no revelation they made themselves, that way - especially considering viewers that have yet to watch the film(s). Those people who watch and don't get the messages, they are simply not able or ready for them, hence those messages have absolutely no value in their present condition.

 Therefore, the only thing i can do is just give some food for thought and hopefully provide some hints: Could those three movies be talking about the fabric of reality? Could they be talking about control? If so, what is that control expressed by? What is Christof in Truman's 'world' or 'reality'? Could he be God? Is there a pun intended by the choice of his name? What could the Architect be? What could the 'Strangers' symbolize? Is there a similarity between Truman's effort to cross the 'sea' confronting Cristof's will and Ulysses' journey confronting the Gods and more specifically Neptune? Could there be a connection between Truman and Ulysses? Could the sea be symbolizing something? Could there be a conection between that and the sea in 'Dark City'? What is Truman's real home? And where? How is he being kept a prisoner? By what values? Aren't those values... valuable? Could someone be abusing them? How are Anderson (Matrix) and Murdock (Dark City) kept prisoners in their cases? What makes them want to escape? If Truman's name is not an accidental choice then could there be meaning in the names Anderson (hint: no, it does not mean son of man - there is NO greek word analogy there except for those who desperately need to put one there - could it simply mean what it SOUNDS?) and Murdock (hint: who was Marduk and what did he do)?  Could those names be significant in each respective movie? How? Could there be a connection between the viewers in the 'Truman Show', the ones plugged into the matrix and the citizens of 'Dark City? What could be the connection between the methods used in all three cases? Could there be a connection with the viewers/humans/citizens OUTSIDE the films? What are the means by which each 'reality' is maintained?

There are so much more (especially if one steps into the metaphysical symbolism in each film) but this is only intented to stir your interest and your thinking process...

I hope you have a good and creative time...

P.S.: As a final thought... Could there be a connection between this film and 'The Dead Poets Society' that happen to have the same director? What was THAT film REALLY about?",1106179200,3,4474,4.7243589743589745
986125,5,6305183023,"Jim Carrey's second best film, in my opinion. Strange, it's not even a comedy.

Truman Burback leads a pretty ordinary life. He gets up, goes to work, has his best friend, his wife, etc. One day, strange things start happening around him and suddenly, Truman starts to see that all isn't as it appears.

Truman's entire life....is a lie. Everything, everyone. It's all a lie. A reality show that began with his birth. He's been on television 24-7 ever since. He begins to think that there's more outside of his little town, and decides to go looking for his first love, but everyone seems intent on keeping him there, even nature itself (which is controlled by the network).

This film has it's humor, don't get me wrong, but I like it for other reasons. I think this is a picture of a possible future for television, a bad future. Everything is a reality show - why not an entire life?",1105660800,3,886,4.525

Jim plays a normal man living in a fake world created by tycoons greedy for money, so they air his life from when he was born till the day he actually finds out there is a real world out there. The funny thing about this movie is when he tries to escape and explore the world, or find his high school love in Fiji, but seems to be in traffic jams, and various characters stops him, like the stupid bus driver, turning the gear to rear and busting the bus. It's funny to see a man living in a world he thinks is real but is surrounded by pro actors, all his life.

986128,5,6305183023,"""The Truman Show"" is a film I often come back to, occasionally, because its premise is so unique and compelling. Certainly, it's a parable and a fantasy; Peter Weir has quite simply added another brilliant film to his awesome filmography. Jim Carrey was expected to be insanely funny because everyone thought he was nuts to begin with. As a previous reviewer said, that's what we expected from Robin Williams, too, and Adam Sandler (""Punch-Drunk Love""). Carrey's performance is so very complete, a wonderful display of sensitivity and focus. I was impressed. Mr. Weir's vision I'm sure had a lot to do with it all, and Laura Linney's performance was much under-rated. Ed Harris was customarily over-reactive. This is a fantasy to be enjoyed and not analyzed at first glance; let it take you in, and question your own mortality. This is a film about self-esteem. For that reason alone, Jim Carrey flies beyond his reputation.",1097539200,10,924,4.967741935483871
986129,5,6305183023,"The Truman Show is one of the most memorable Jim Carey movies I have seen as a child. Truth be told, it kind of scared me to think that everyone was watching your every move. On some level, it's been a movie that has stayed in my mind for a long time. It can compel a person to think.

As for the humor, the jokes seem more cynical and mocking than they do funny. Every once in a while, there will be a simple comedic joke, but on the whole, the humor in this movie seems to be used as a tool in order to convey the inhumanity of what has been done to Truman.

At least, that's my take on it.

As for the plot, here it is: Truman is a character that was obtained as a baby by a man that wanted to use him to create the perfect show that's on twenty-four/seven. He grew up with a family whose entire existence was likely fake--an assumed role--and the only girl that tried to reveal the truth to him was taken away when they were teenagers. He is now about 30, with a wife and a job and a seemingly normal, perfect life. Yet around this time, Truman begins to reject the perfect image as more and more odd things begin to happen. He digs under the surface, where the people behind his life surely don't want him looking. Dramatic things begin to happen in an effort to throw Truman off, such as the return of his assumed-dead father. But nothing can keep the truth burried now that Truman's got a piece of it.",1097366400,,1408,4.112727272727272
986130,5,6305183023,"Many of the best comedies ever made have been about subjects that hardly seem funny in real life.  Nuclear holocaust is hardly a humorous topic, but ""Dr. Strangelove,"" a film about a Doomsday Machine that destroys the entire Earth with nuclear weapons is still one of the greatest comedies of all time.  ""The Producers,"" a film about creating a play that praises Hitler draws laughs to this day.

""The Truman Show"" is another film that causes us to laugh at things that scare us.  The idea of wasting thirty years of your life not knowing that you live in a fake, controlled world is not funny at all.  In fact, given the current state of television and reality shows, it seems downright frightening.  Of course, the film could have been handled very differently, it could have been delivered as a straight drama, and maybe it would have been just as good.  But the film is in no way harmed by it's comedic treatment of a serious subject - at no point does the film trivialize the subject matter.  Compare ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Fail-Safe,"" two great films with very different treatments of the same subject.

Peter Weir (one of the more talented, less-known living directors) does a fine job.  Jim Carrey gives a rare honest, comedic performance without ever overdoing it (at no point in the film does he talk out of his backside, eg. Ace Ventura.)  The soundtrack is surprisingly great, enhancing the mood of the film quite well.

The film is just the right length, and ends in a nearly perfect manner.

The ending is especially unsatisfying - what does Truman do next, do these jerks get away with what they did, does he have a ""normal"" life after this, are all left unanswered. Waaay to long as well. At least twenty minutes of this flick could and should have been left on the cutting room floor. Instead of feeling entertained when it's over, the viewer feels like one of the voyeurs who exploited Truman. Jim Carrey fans should rent ""Ace Ventura"" instead.",1094256000,2,760,4.765151515151516
986132,5,6305183023,"I've never been a fan of Jim Carey, but the idea behind this film intrigued me. I'm glad I saw it because it is an incredible work. In fact I am duly impressed with the completeness of the entire project. The script, direction, performances and attention to detail all mix to create a veritable trompe l' oeil, much like the fictitious world of Truman.

This innovative film appeals to so many compelling concepts: The ubiquitous dint of television, the inclination of people to live vicariously through others, the turbid line between reality and the illusory, and the paranoia that someone is always `watching us'. At times I think that I must be some unwitting actor on a giant stage, being manipulated by some demiurgic force, because the world seems too ludicrous (not to mention the people that inhabit it) to be real.

Of course the most piquant aspect of the movie is the exploration of the idea of a higher being. Truman's quest for the truth of his specious world is analogous to man's search for the meaning of religion, and ultimately, God. This is played out masterfully here. When the transmission is cut a person from the barroom exclaims `Jesus, God In Heaven!' As Truman nears his escape Sylvia (from outside of the fake world) ironically prays for his deliverance. Christof (catch the name?), played by Ed Harris, sits in his control room as the eminence grise of Truman's world. As the `creator' of the TV show that Carey's character dwells in, his position is plenary. The trouble is that Truman has questions that his ostensible family and friends cannot answer. Truman knows his life is a mendacious trap and he wants manumission. Ultimately Truman and Christof collide at the boundary of the faade as the former forces a theomachy. The omnipotent entity tries to force his recalcitrant subject to repent and return to his existence, but he refuses and finally rejects his originator.

Other moments in the film are as entertaining as the concepts are deep. The technological glitches are amusing and the people trying to get on the set and warn him are great (esp. the guy jumping out of the Christmas present). The viewers are interesting too; the lady who ignores her crying child in order to see the show, the elderly women who watch so intently, and of course the security guards who provide the movie's prescient ending when they realize the show is finally over, `What else is on?'",1091404800,10,2410,4.8024096385542165

986160,4,6305183023,"This movie has two true modes of representation: how television perpetuates through society and how people treat celebrities.  First of all, Truman is no more a victim than a result of circumstances.  His fate was ultimately chosen by a dictatorial creator (played brilliantly by Ed Harris, who deserved an Oscar nomination rightly so).  But as Truman discovers the truth about his pre-ordained life, the ""audience"" becomes captivated.  The people in the bar console each other and try to rationalize Truman's decisions.  The real truth about television is revealed at the very end when the two security men say ""What else is on?"" after Truman escapes.  We, as Americans, have so readily counted on television as a main source of not only entertainment, but solace.  We live our lives through the medium of the character.  So, in a way, this movie is a ""movie within a movie.""
Additionally, the movie symbolizes in some small way how we idolize celebrities.  Truman is a celebrity.  The people in Seahaven are all aware, but do not tell him he is on T.V.  Rather, they all ""act.""  This is somewhat interesting because in a way, the actors may want to keep Truman on the island, not only for their jobs' sake, but also because he is an idol.
The truth is, however, that television has a commanding grasp on the American public, and that is the point of the movie.  We lift the minority of celebrities (Harris as the director, the media, etc.) on our shoulders.  It's almost as if we are brainwashed by T.V.
Harris's character is most intriguing.  You don't know if he is helping Truman or hurting him.  Harris plays a somewhat symbolic father.  He believes that since he gave Truman ""a life to live,"" that he knows what is right for Truman.  That knowledge also gives Harris the ability to destroy him, as exemplified by the storm scene at the end.
Overall, this movie is unique and ground-breaking, and I recommend it to all.",1086566400,,1925,4.72972972972973

Ed Harris shows his love for Truman but his unwillingness to let Truman experience anything that would make him more human undermines what he's trying to do.
It also pointed out the flaws in the system, the main problem is that they made it too perfect and made it follow their own scripts instead of letting Truman discover these things for himself. They didn't allow him to have a legitimate and a real love interest and instead forced on him the relationship they wanted. But beyond that it shows the increasing voyeurism of the viewers.
The Truman Show shows us what television is like know, even though it was filmed in 1998. It's really a remarkable and prophetic view of what we would and will continue to be interested in on TV. From Christof's first speech: people tired of seeing fake emotions and special effects to when he says,""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented."" We accept it as being reality, even though we latch on a little cynicism knowing that there is story editing, casted stereotypes, and ""confessionals."" The ""reality"" is sucked out.

Bought at birth by a huge corporation, Truman is his own tv show broadcast all over the world.  Everyone around him is an actor.  For almost 30 years, nothing goes wrong, but as Truman grows older he begins to realize something is up and tries to find out what.  This is a great movie that blends comedy and drama.  Carrey has some physical comedy, but much less than in his other films.  Watching Truman try to figure things out are the best scenes in the movie.  Boosting the movie is an excellent score by Burkhard Dallwitz.  This is a very good movie with something for everyone.
  Jim Carrey has never been better than his role as Truman Burbank, a man who is unknowingly the star of his own TV show.  This part really allowed him to show that he is more than just a physical comedian.  Ed Harris is equally as good as Christof, the creator of The Truman Show who is so dedicated to his creation that he refuses to let if fail.  Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich also star as Meryl, Truman's wife, and Marlon, Truman's best friend since he was seven.  The DVD offers tv spots, theatrical trailers, and the widescreen presentation.

Fortunately, I got the chance to see it at a friend's house, and I can honestly say that it left me speechless and amazed at the brilliance of the film. First of all, Jim Carrey excells in this role. I find him to be a very funny man in real life, but his wacky roles in previous movies (Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber...you know them) don't appeal to me at all. BUT, in this role, he shows that he is way more than a go-to weirdo or funnyman. The emotion and the vulnerability he brings to the naive Truman Burbank only improves as the movie goes on. Watching this man crack as the only world he knows begins to slowly betray him and the intensity of his attempts to discover what else is beyond his hidden cage is moving in a way that few movies can convey successfully.
This movie is more than just about watching Truman Burbank find out the truth of his televised life, but it is a stunning portrayal of humanity. Truman's world was created by Christof (the always wonderful Ed Harris) to be what is considered ""perfection."" Christof is like God in the Seahaven world. He makes every choice for the world, including the weather and even Truman's fears...but Christof cannot change the one thing that noone can manipulate--Truman's thoughts. Truman is given the perfect wife, a brotherly bestfriend, a steady job, and a life in a world that exists without pain, sadness, or evil. But the world is a cage. The movie shows that stability is not perfection, ignorance is not bliss, and a life without ALL emotions--including sadness, fear, and pain--could never exist. Even without knowing that he is trapped, Truman feels the need to escape his ""perfect"" life and to see what else there is beyond the utopia that is Seahaven Island. It is a perfect display of our quest for the unknown, unsatisfaction with just mundane existence, and our interest in what normality really is.
When you watch this movie, you will become just like the viewers in the movie who are watching Truman. You will root for him, cry for him, and laugh with (or at) him. His is truly a reality show that I hope that never is created for real...but we ARE humans, so who knows how we'll try to play God next...

986198,5,6305183023,"Truman Burbank ( Jim Carrey) is a television star and he doesn't even know it. When he was a only a baby, he was adopted by a man named Cristof (Ed Harris). Cristof came up with the idea of the Truman Show. The show revolves solely around Truman himself, and the life that he leads. The city that he lives in is constructed specifically for the show, and everone in it is an actor playing a part. Even his wife ( Laura Linney), and best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich). The world has been watching Truman since he was a baby, and it is the number one rated show in the country. But gradually Truman starts to realize what is going on...
I am a huge fan of Jim Carrey. All of his movies have been entertaining from ""The Mask"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"", to his latest film ""Bruce Almighty"". However, the film that I enjoyed him the most in, concentrated less on the typical slapstick comedy that one has come to expect from a Jim Carrey film, and more on making you laugh through emotion and subtlety. The story itself is highly original and entertaining. The idea of one man being oblivious to the world aroud him is extremely funny. The fact that he is the center of a TV show only makes it funnier. All of the actors do an outstanding job. Of course Carrey steals the show with Truman. The transition from being naive, to a determined man is amazing. He plays both sides so well. Laura Linney is outstanding as his wife. She must put on the happy homemaker facade and pretend to love Truman. The funniest thing about the character is how she must constantly advertise products with everything that she does. Noah Emmerich is great as his best friend Marlon. Watching him try to convince Truman that it is just his mind playing tricks on him is hillarious. Even when a stage light falls from the sky, or it is sunny at 9:00 p.m., him and the rest of the actors try to convince Truman he is seeing things. Ed Harris does a nice job with Cristof considering the limited amount of screen time he had. It is also dissapointing as well. For such an important character, he has very little to do with the overall story. The rest of the actors in the film also do a great job as well.
""The Truman Show"" will make you laugh, and keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering if Truman will ever get out. The ending is very satisfying too. This is definately Carrey's best film. He and the rest of the cast does an amazing job, and really makes the film believeable. The DVD is somewhat dissapointing though. I would have loved to seen a making of featurette. Unfortunately, there is just the movie and the trailer. I have never been able to understand why movie studios feel that offering a trailer as a special feature is an added bonus. If you are going to watch the film, then why would you need to see a movie trailer? This is a must own, but go with the VHS!!",1069200000,4,2849,4.327102803738318
986199,4,6305183023,"I watched this movie because I am interested in cultural representations of suburbia in America.  I did heavy research on such imagery and saw repeated references to The Truman Show.  So I watched and I was stunned by how Truman's entire world was fabricated to create the ""ideal"" life, much like a suburban environment.
The irony is, that the Truman Show was filmed at Seaside, a ""new urbanist"" development designed by architect Andres Duany, a critic of suburban design.  New urbanism is supposedly a movement against the conformity and sprawling layout of traditional suburban development.  Clearly, Truman's ""new urbanist"" environment is just as conforming and fabricated as suburbia (if not more so).  In the Truman Show, the main character played by Jim Carey realizes exactly how controlled his environment is, and essentially loses it and tries to escape to the ""real world.""
While the main plot focuses on the paranoia of having his life broadcasted worldwide, I was more fascinated with the representation of this ""new urbanist"" environment (which actually exists!) as a freakishly-controlled bubble or a design experiment.  It's a great critique on new suburban, ""progressive"" design ideas.",1067212800,3,1201,5.328042328042328

This along with your family is the most guarded thing you'll find, unless you're some nutcase who has to tell every single thing of their life for the fun of it. What if your most personal and traumatic moments were caught on tape for someone to see? What if the entire world saw?  That's the basic concept of this film which might be prophetic in the near future.
Truman Burbank leads a rather ordinary life: beautiful wife, normal home, good job, a caring best friend and a quiet town.  Until strange things start to happen: spotlights fall from the sky, elevators that aren't elevators, and an even a strange encounter with his supposed deceased father.  Slowly Truman starts to uncover the truth: his life is a fabrication, his friends and his wife actors and his town is a set and Truman's quest to break free and return to the only woman who actually loves him.
Acting? Top notch. Jim Carrey does get a chance to act nuts but there's also drama and you can see he's more than a rather goofy actor. Ed Harris plays kind of a duel role: the creator of the show with Truman's best interests at heart but also an almost strict forcing(you'll see this at the end). But honors go to Laura Linney. She plays that nice suburban housewife so well: one of my favorite scenes is when Truman looks like he's having a nervous breakdown and she has a sympathizing expression then she turns right around and does an obvious product placement ad.

Sadly the only thing people really talked about in this movie was Jim Carrey's breaks into drama but this could make you paranoid as well: what if Big Brother and the world as well is watching?",1066435200,3,1705,4.565359477124183

Truman is a man that lives in an artificially-created world, a giagantic, elaborate set for the most popular TV show ever created.
When Truman begins discovering the true nature of his world and remembering the love they tore away from him, he questions his entire life.
This film is an absolute must for anyone who loves the art of movies. Just incredible.

986202,5,6305183023,"For those of us who think that Hollywood studios are incapable of producing anything but loud, violent and mindless garbage (think ""Gone in Sixty Seconds,"" but one could cite endless examples), ""The Truman Show"" is proof positive that great movies are still possible.
Truman Burbank is a bright, imaginative 30-year-old account executive at an insurance company with a pretty blonde wife and a best friend who fills vending machines for a living.  He lives on Seahaven Island, a near-perfect community where the sun shines and life is good.  But Truman, like George Bailey in Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" has the urge to explore.  To see what's out there in the world beyond Seahaven Island.  And, especially, to find out what happened to the beautiful girl he briefly loved and lost in his college days when she abruptly moved to Fiji.
The truth is, of course, that his whole life is a lie.  Truman's life, 24-hours-a-day, is a television show broadcast live and without commercial interruption to the entire world -- and has been from the minute he was born.  It's the ultimate paranoid fantasy.  They really *are* watching him.
""The Truman Show,"" while playing with some interesting ideas about the nature of reality, is not a heavy, didactic film.  It is both dramatic and, due to a brilliantly clever screenplay and the performance of Jim Carrey, surprisingly funny.  I especially liked the luminous Laura Linney as Truman's put-upon wife, who finally cracks under the pressure of living with a man who's beginning to comprehend and question the faux-nature of his reality.  Natascha MacElhone is oddly believable in the tiny but crucial role of the woman who loves Truman for who he really is.
This DVD edition is pretty sparse -- no extra scenes, no extra commentary by the star, the writer or the director -- but it is definitely worth the price.  While I would have liked to have heard director Peter Weir discuss, among other things, why Dennis Hopper was replaced in the role of Cristof (the ""creator"" of The Truman Show) by Ed Harris, the film itself is so good, so dense and so intriguing in its dramatic explorations of its themes and ideas that you can easily do without the extra goodies.  My one peeve with the DVD is the stupid blimp that you have to sit through in order to access certain features.  *That* I could have easily done without.
While the 1990s were a pretty pathetic era in American filmmaking, I would nonetheless put ""The Truman Show"" alongside ""Good Fellas,"" ""Deconstructing Harry"" and ""Avalon"" as one of the best mainstream films of the decade.  Highly recommended.",1062979200,,2611,4.864559819413093

The fil shows us the story of a man living a boring fantasy of safety and routine, and how he tries to escape from it. This movie, i believe, is open to many interpretations, which is what makes it so interesting. In my opinion, this movie is about a very, very old story: The Garden of Eden. The set in which Truman lives is his own Eden, although he doesnt know so. However, as the movie develops, we see that in this version of the story, it's not God who kicks Adan out of Eden, rather than try to stop him from leaving at all cost.

Modern productions seem to always have generous helpings of foul language, sex, vomiting and bathroom scenes, but this film is a notable exception.  Here, the human condition as experienced in the early 21st century is explored in a humorous and satirical way, but with real questions about man's search for meaning, both as an individual and in society in general being explored.  This film uncannily anticipated what so-called ""reality"" television would be like, showing that ""reality"" as perceived by Hollywood, or rather, what Hollywood perceives people thinking reality is, is something out of a nightmare.  Perceptive viewers will note that the ""town"" Truman lives in is very similar in some ways to ""the village"" seen in the classic television series ""The Prisoner"" starring Patrick McGoohan, including people aimlessly riding about on bicycles.  Although everything seems nice and ordered, it is a sterile world filled with artificial emotions and constant surveillance.  Jim Carrey, whom I was not a big fan of before seeing this film puts in a stellar performance, appearing in almost every scene of the film and Ed Harris plays his usual authoritarian-type character in a chilling way.
Today, ""freedom"" is defined as ""doing whatever you want"" (e.g. ""if it feels good, do it!""), but the Founding Fathers of the United States regarded it rather as the ability to reach one's maximum potential without artificial, outside constraints, even if this proves to be difficult and uncomfortable (one example being the homesteaders of the 19th century American West who actually often faced great dangers in exercising their freedom).  This is the choice that is confronted in this motion picture.  Although the ending doesn't really present the choice in these stark terms, Truman must make his decision and live with the consequences.",1059523200,,1919,5.268852459016394

The Truman Show is a new generation of film. I have never seen a film like that before.

The plot centers around a man named Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey. Right from his beginnings (meaning his birth) he has been the subject of a TV show in which everyone he knows is not really who he thinks they are, but merely actors playing a role. He alone is unaware of this fact. He is broadcasted live and with an audience all around the world. The frightening thing about it is the fact that it worked perfectly for over 30 years, without the notice of its star. Nevertheless he someday discovers that something is happening around him, that certain things seem planned or fake.  Truman has the courage to encounter the truth with knowing that his world could shatter. That is why I think it is not only the producers ambition to reveal what is possible in times of Reality TV, he also wants to show that it is our (the viewers) choice to watch it and support it or to go back to our own lives and experience them.

This movie represents something that is not real. It is fiction. The premiss is, however, real. If there was a show on, where you got to follow a young man growing up, and living his life, there would be a LOT of people watching. Some people WOULD more or less put their lives on hold during significant moments of the show. This is the sheer brilliance of this movie. And rest assured: This movie is excellent.
There have been arguments that a show of this kind would not be followed, if it were real life, with audiences being fickle. The thing is that the show changes. Christof (a superb Ed Harris) has thrown in all kinds of things happening to Truman (Will we ever see Jim Carrey better? I don't think I could take that in!), nothing majorly life-altering, but subtle changes, which keeps up the dynamics of the show.
And come on! If you don't think that people could get that involved: Just look at stuff like Big Brother. For some reason, people seem to want more. (Hey, they've brought it back four times) People want things that can help them take their mind off things. People WANT to watch ""perfect"" worlds. Otherwise shows like ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and games like ""The Sims"" would not exist. ""The Sims"" is, more or less, your own little Truman Show.
As for ""people putting their lives on hold"" to convince Truman that what he sees is real... It's called acting, and I think they would be paid pretty well.
All in all: this is what producers of ""reality shows"" do to the participants on a daily basis. The participants emerge (from a Big Brother house or similar) only to see that the producers have done exactly whatever they want with the participants' lives. In essence, a lot of the people who go into a ""Big Brother"" house, are going to have their lives wrecked. The producers can do exactly anything they want, in that respect.'
What is actually the most chilling aspect of the ending is the two security guards, who simply switch from watching a person whose life has been led by someone else, to saying ""So what else is on?"" This gives me the creeps, because this is as close as you can get to modern television ""moral."" Truman's life, after having been watched for over 30 years, is worth nothing more than the press of a button.",1056585600,2,2279,4.520581113801453
986248,5,6305183023,"Often, people questioned whether or not Jim Carrey was capable of pulling off anything else than playing a moron with a funny face. Most of these people were silenced when 'The Truman Show' came out. Carrey proves he's more than capable of firing cheap (but funny) jokes at the audience. In fact, he does a helluva job as an actor here.
Truman Burbank is your average Joe. A boring administrative job at a bank. A house with a fence and a wife. Nice friends. Or are they? Or in fact, is he?
As it turns out, Truman, while being a baby, has become the world's first 24/7 soap star. He was removed from the 'real world' and placed into a giant city-sized studio. He's the world's most-viewed person on the planet, and doesn't realize it.
His friends are in fact hired actors. His city is nothing but props. His wife married him for the sake of the show (And probably her wage and the marketing beneficials). So what _IS_ in fact real?
Well, Truman is. Truman's dream is to head off to the Fiji Islands some day. Within his own (very small) world, Truman's life is genuine. The life, dreams, and thoughts of a real man, wanting to escape this place of utter boredom. Not that it's so bad there, but there's a whole world to explore, right?
With and with, Truman starts to realise he's trapped in a carefully and closely directed world. Slowly, but surely, he catches on, and tests the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the people directing his life.
The script itself challenges the reader. With soap operas occupying a LOT of airspace, and 'reality' programs like 'Big Brother' and 'American Idols' becoming more-and-more popular, where will it end? We already deprived people from their dignity and privacy. What's the next step? Their life?
Is our thirst for genuine TV enough to force us into this scenario? Or would we rather have reality game shows where people are being slaughtered alive? (See The Running Man).",1056499200,,1915,4.668639053254438
986249,5,6305183023,"let me start off by saying that i am a huge jim carrey fan. HUGE!! Have been since Ace Ventura, when i was 6. So, of course, growing up, his comedies have made me laugh, and helped create the person i am today(im now nearly 16)
So, back when i was around 11 and i heard that jim had a new movie coming out, i was beside myself, and rushed to the cinema as soon as it was released. To put it mildly, i was sorely disappointed. What had happened to the Jim that had once made me throw up from laughing so much?
After that, i was put off Jim for a while. Didnt even go see Man on the Moon when it came out (i saw it only recently, and was very impressed, by the way)
Then one day, not long before me, myself and irene came out, the truman show was on tv. I had nothing else to do, so i decided to watch it.
This time round, i was genuinely impressed. No, more then impressed; i watched the movie with my mouth hanging open for most bits. By this time, i was 13, and had learned to appreciate peoples acting skills more and more, and that is probably why i didn't like it the first time around; i was too immature.
So, after watching the movie the 2nd time, i came to a realisation: Jim Carrey is an absolutely amazing actor, very underrated, and WAS ROBBED OF THE OSCAR!!! both times, for truman show AND Man on the Moon. I now don't have much respect for the Academy as i once did.
Anyway, back to the movie. Probably my favourite movie EVER! besides Lord of the Rings..and the Mask. The movie was stunning to look at, and really a one of a kind. Very original. It was like the matrix in a weird sort of way. Had never really been done before, and has now been copied considirably.
The acting was great from all parts. Ed Harris was quite disturbing in the way he thought he was doing Truman a world of good by keeping his locked in his prison.
I also love the way the movie was made, how they quite often showed the image through the cameras from rings, pencil sharpeners etc. i thought that was great.

We knew, since PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK, that this director is able to describe the fantastic side of the most normal situations.

Although Truman Burbank (predictably)ends up leaving the TV world and enters the real world at the end (and is presumably happy), the ending is less than inspiring. No amount of triumphant violin music at the end can change the fact that Truman wasted most of his life, if you can call it that. So see this tear-jerker disguised as a heart-warming comedy.

I would not say that it is great entertainment; it's definitely not a movie to watch if you want to enjoy a good time and to feel better. Instead this ""psychological"" movie seems to be raising questions about individual Freedom and Privacy in our so-called ""modern, Western, democratic"" societies. Of course this is an important subject, and above all, this is a deep philosophical matter which needs to be constantly debated, because individual freedom can be endangered in many many ways . Naturally, very few things are more important than a person's freedom - and nothing is more precious than happiness I believe. So this movie, well in line with the Big Bother syndromes, raises important questions but does not try to give even the beginning of an answer or of a reason. The real problem however is : what do you believe in ? Do you believe in mankind ? Do you trust yourself ?? Do you trust your neighbour ? How much self-esteem do you have ? How much esteem do you need to feel happy ? How much love do you need to receive and to give to be happy ?? Unfortnately this movie does not provide any clues; it is just describing an absurd life, led by a guy who is a real prisoner inside a sort of virtual nightmare, cornered in a squarely strange bubble. What is very disturbing in this movie is the fact that somebody else decided that this person should be in this place without his consent and even without his knowledge, based on some dubious ethical grounds (here also the movie does not go far in providing clues). In essence it is describing a subtle and dangerous form of euthanasia , the euthanasia of freedom !! So is this movie a call to fight such threats to our freedom, or is it just a cold description or something that may happen, or has happened, or happens sometimes ?

Well, I perfectly related to Truman, even though I do not live my life on a television show.  Do I?  Anyway, Truman Burbank could be any of us.  He's just the average Joe on the street, but he feels mysteriously isolated, so he goes off, on what could be considered a mid-life crisis, and searches for the truth of his existence.  I mean, if we can't relate to isolation and curiosity about existence then maybe we could related his daily goings, or we could go out more.  I know that Truman's world is made up of cameras and lights, unbeknownst to Truman, but even though he is living on a man made TV set, his life is just that common journey of trying to find out who we really are on the inside.

Everyone in Truman's life are portrayed by actors. Jim Carrey does an excellent job of portraying a man who realizes his life is not what it seams to be. Truman meats a girl, who is also an actress, that wants to free him from this show. When she tries to tell him the truth she is removed from the show. Throughout the movie Truman shows his infatuation with this girl.
The Truman show demonstrates how Hollywood blurrs the line between fiction and reality and how far they are willing to go to manipulate people. The Truman show is the extreme form of reality show that entrapts unsuspecting people, in this case Truman. The Truman Show demonstrates that Hollywood will go as far as its audience will let them. The reality shows today illustrate how far people are willing to be embarssed and humilated. I had an instructor that says these reality shows appeal to the lowest level of intellegence.

986361,5,6305183023,"Anyone who thinks this is merely a movie about a guy in a reality TV show who one day figures out its all a big lie - will be pleasantly surprised.
Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man who's unknowingly growing up in a perfect town that's really a huge TV set in a reality TV series called 'The Truman Show'.
To maintain the ongoing viewership of this reality show, its producer Cristoff (Harris) utilises control elements (actors, special effects) to condition Truman to lead his life around established parameters that form the general TV plot.
For example, Truman's true love (Natascha McElhone i think) is purposefully edged out of his life by her 'father' (you can't see her anymore, she's going to Fiji) and Truman's eventual wife (Linney), when McElhone's character decides to tell Truman the truth about his role in the reality show.
And when Truman expresses a desire to go to Fiji to find his love, his 'best friend' tells him there is no need to venture beyond their shores, that everything is so perfect the way it is, and that they can enjoy perfect sunsets every single day...  why ask for more, why go to Fiji?
And when Truman shows early signs of adventure and decides to go sailing, Cristoff cooks up a storm at 'sea' and drowns his 'father' in an attempt to snuff out his quest for adventure.
But you just can't keep a good man down.  Eventually, the human spirit triumphs, despite all the negativity, assumptions and established parameters we face everyday and know as 'Life'.
Ironically, the millions of viewers who have grown up with Truman and seen his highs and lows on reality TV, cry and cheer for Truman when he eventually triumphs and leaves the movie set.  He leaves everything that is perfect but empty behind, and steps into the big black unknown alone, but full of hope and expectancy.  The finale will get you crying and cheering along with the movie's TV audience.
Quite simply, The Truman Show is about
- questioning assumptions and what is seemingly the truth
- how everyone loves a hero but doesn't dare to be one themselves
- how fulfilling dreams take courage and faith in the face of negativity and adversity
- asking yourself what you can change in your life
Peter Weir ties together these life lessons without being overly didactic - which is why many people miss the point of this movie.
The Truman Show is certainly an underrated, misunderstood movie that has been intelligently and poignantly delivered.  Go see it today.",1035504000,12,2463,4.71860465116279
986362,2,6305183023,"Jim Carrey is surely proves he is a great actor - but this movie is stepping on slippery philosophical grounds.  Underlying the interesting concept of unknowingly spending your entire life on television, The Truman Show teaches us that human beings are not capable of understanding and perceiving ""true reality."" Just as in Plato's Republic, in the example of the cave shadows that are mistaken for reality, Jim Carrey is only allowed to understand Truth once he breaks beyond the bounds of our Earthly constraints.  The movie asks, how can we know anything at all for sure?
Hanging on to such metaphysical assumptions is very dangerous.  Existence requires no explanation for why it is exists, because it exists before and independant of any human perception. Existence exists - it is a foundation, an axiom, and hated by professors of philsophy the world round.
The danger of The Truman Show's ""primacy of conciousness"" nod is understood when we are told that ""philosopher kings,"" the select few who hold the genius and ability to understand ""true reality"" must reign over the rest of us - you begin to lay the philosophical foundation for dictatorship.",1035417600,,1155,5.036649214659686

It was really just about a world wide audience watching an everyday guy's boring life. No real action, no honestly from his best friend, ever, and it doesn't even show him interacting with he REAL world for the first time in his life.
It didn't really show the girl he really liked and him being together that long. For how much of the movie showed his life as a rat in a giant cage, they could've showed him being outside in the real world for the first time in his life to compensate.
It was like 'Enemy of the State', but only with all his clothes and everywhere he went. Also, the movie was a little too serious because Jim Carrey wasn't really putting on any comedy performances.
It was just depressing for a guy to know that after 30 years of his life wasted that he finally realizes that he's been played for a fool all that time. If it were another actor that's younger and to find out about his unfortunate life after only 20 years, then he'd still have his whole life ahead of him.

986365,4,6305183023,"A man called Truman (Jim Carrey) lives on an island somewhere. The life inside is quite normal for him. He looks like a current guy who works in an office, but actually, he's the most regarded man in the world. I explain: the whole island is in fact a hidden TV studio, full of cameras placed everywhere in order to follow him, because he is the main part of the programme on television. All people know this, but Truman doesn't, so they act to make the stage a normal city. However, he begins to notice some weird events, for example, the surprise of seeing his dead father like a beggar in the street and a large amount of people who suddenly bring him away.
 This movie is so funny because of these incidents, which make you understand the trick and laugh all the time. Nevertheless, when he realizes all this, you see that it isn't funny at all, because he feels he's been living in an illusory world. Nobody loves him in fact, so he decides to escape out of the island in order to find a place with no lies. All is a trap. In this moment you see his frustration because of the incapability of being able to do that inside his comical appearance. This is the first movie in which Jim Carrey stars in with a serious portrayal, despite he's amusing in many moments.
 I liked it a lot. It is one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen because of the so entertaining situations in which he gets involved. Also, the comedy turns into a drama at the end. Will he finish living in a world where real people exist and love, without lies nor being the point of attention to everybody? Anyway, even being the man who attracts all people's interest, nobody cares about him when he crosses the door outside the island to an unknown place and they just finish up by ignoring him and choosing another channel.",1027987200,8,1806,4.372023809523809
986366,4,6305183023,"The first time I watched ""The Truman Show"" I had a tough time getting past the reverential critical reaction hyping the film.  Nary a discouraging word was said by those honoured scribes, and until I saw the movie, I believed them.  Sadly, no film could live up to such lofty praise, and ""The Truman Show"" was no exception.  I felt disappointed by its imperfection.  Until I saw the film again recently, that is, clear of the hype.  My reaction to it was much different this time.  It's a very good -- thought not great -- film.
The major problem I have with ""The Truman Show"" is that it gives up its secret too early.  A much more suspenseful movie could have been made if the audience, along with the protagonist, were kept in the dark longer.  The sense of discovery these two entities could have shared would be staggering, the ultimate revelation of the man behind the curtain.  I understand why the movie didn't go this way.  I understand why director Peter Weir, a sensible sort, didn't want his movie to be about a gimmick (oh what a gimmick it would have been!).  He was aiming for a bigger metaphor, and I think he hit it just perfectly.
The town/studio that the filmmakers have created is a wonder to behold.  Self-contained, it's designed to both steer Truman along his daily path, so that the camera can catch the product placements which are the sole source of the show's revenue, and to psychologically torment him, so that he'll never ever think of leaving.  It's a town filled with little flourishes that only the discerning viewer will catch.  Did you notice that the garbage can his neighbour is always carrying has an eyehole?  It's just one touch, unexplained throughout that film's first half that contributed to the flawless tapestry of the town.
The film is structured wonderfully.  Except for an expository prologue (which cheekily replaces the film's credits with what appears to be the TV-show-within-the-film's credits), the audience is allowed to slowly follow Truman's discovery that the world he thought was real is not all it appears to be.  A studio light falls from the sky; confusing, until a radio report later that day reveals that an airplane inexplicably dropped some equipment.  Truman's long lost father, dressed in ratty clothing, attempts to make contact with him; later, a newspaper headline bemoans town's homeless problem.  Most effectively, Truman longs to be reunited with the true love of his life in a way that's at first hinted at, then, in a stunning revelatory moment, becomes bold and emotional.
With all this good stuff to behold, this is one of the few times when a film's running time feels too short.  ""The Truman Show"", possibly because it is ostensibly a movie about a popular TV show, sells itself short.  It needn't have wrapped itself up too quickly.  I could have stood another thirty or forty minutes tacked on to its already hundred minute running time, the better to enjoy the richness of the world that has been created, to more effectively delve into the past that has come to inform the present story, and to allow the fine cast to further explore and flesh-out the characters they've been given.
Jim Carrey got a lot of credit for taking a role that would seem to be miles away from manic buffoon he usually plays.  Well, that assessment is only half right.  For most of the film's first half, Truman is a boisterous fellow, amiable and friendly to all.  He isn't yet suspicious that something is amiss, and thus he gives as much joy as he gets.  The joy he gets doesn't come from real people, though.  It comes from actors.  Truman, a grotesque anthropological experiment, has never encountered sincerity.  The insipid greeting he repeats every morning (""Good morning... and if I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night"") is little more than a catchphrase, delivered with a full fake smile and a mock-warm head tilt.  These scenes have Carrey smack dab in his element, playing over the top and phony.  But there's a purpose to his phoniness; it contrasts with the realization that Truman has to make in the film's second half, and the change that Carrey has to enact to go along with it.  He becomes a quieter man, in moments.  And when his mania bursts out, it comes in the form of a cunning schemer, intent on breaking down the walls that he just discovered are fencing him in.  Carrey pulls off both of these sides of Truman very well, and although you can sometimes see though the seams and tell he's Oscar-fishing, it never detracts from the performance.
As for the grand metaphor that Weir, in conjunction with screenwriter Andrew Niccol, is looking for, well, it's certainly not an attack on the reality TV craze.  That's a not-so-sacred cow that gets tagged in the crossfire, but certainly not the target the film is aiming at.  It's really trying to make a point about loneliness.  More specifically, the loneliness of the authentic man.  In a world ravaged by greed and self-preservation, Truman is the only sincere person, and it's slowly eating him up inside.  He thinks he lives in a town that's friendly and caring.  He doesn't know that they're all paid to be there, and that he has no real friends or real family to call his own.  His final choice, whether to stay in his comfortable yet hollow existence or forage forth into the great unknown, is a moment played with suspense and, ultimately, grace.  Should he stay or should he go?  That's the moral issue the film lays at the audience's feet.  And as it keeps reminding us, the most important question, the one that none of us ever find the answer to in our real lives, is this: How is it all going to end?",1026086400,2,5674,4.693629929221435
986367,5,6305183023,"Brilliant movie. I'm not sure why this movie came and went without much noise being made. Was it the fact that it was just another Jim Carrey movie... let alone Jim Carrey in a fairly dramatic role? My children almost seemed disappointed in Carrey. Disappointed in the fact that he wasn't acting like his normal characters - like Ace Ventura, Stanley Ipkiss or Lloyd Christmas. Wonderful performance by Jim Carrey and his supporting cast... Ed Harris, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich (as Marlon). A film about false reality... all the characters in Truman's life are paid actors. Halfway thru, the story really picks up when Truman starts to figure things out. It's interesting to see the home audience watching and their reactions... from the viewers in the bar, the senior citizens watching at home with their Truman pillows, the car attendents, and even the guy that is forever in his bathtub. Truman Burbank's life is a TV show, and the whole world is watching. His dilemma begins when he gets the urge to explore - as he is telling his best friend Marlon about the need to ""get out there and see the world""... first stop is the island of Fiji. Naturally, the producer of the TV show (Ed Harris as 'Cristof'), wants to keep him at bay and will do anything to stop him... for without Truman, he has no show. Truman has been forever afraid of the ocean - since his father 'died' in a storm at sea right before his eyes. Now Truman must sneak away from the cameras and face the ocean to leave his so-called  reality. Cristof finds him in his boat and throws a wicked storm his way. Outlasting the storm Truman finds that the horizon isn't really what it seems. Great movie with a great ending. It makes you think about what ""could"" really be going on somewhere... that something or someone might be watching YOU.",1025222400,,1812,4.609907120743034
986368,4,6305183023,"The inspiring and heartfelt character of Truman reminded me of Forrest Gump.  This may be Carrey's best performance ever even though it doesn't at all tap into his comedian skills.
This movie has many interpretations, but the one that stuck out most in my mind was that of ""the truth shall set you free"" versus ""ignorance is bliss.""
Truman lives in an artificial world where all his ""friends"" and even his wife are paid actors.  Even the weather is fake and controlled.  The director Christof defends that Truman's world is just as real as the ""real world"" only Truman's world is much safer, more pleasant, etc.
Once Truman begins to discover the truth of his world, his exploring nature leads him to break free from the studio world despite opposition, discomfort, and even endangerment to his life.  This is supposed to show that truth is better than deception and that we have free will, etc.  But if you think about it, Truman really had little choice.  How could he get in bed with wife again knowing that all along, she has been a paid actor, as have been all his friends.  How could he live with the betrayal; how could he continue as he had before knowing the world is watching him 24hrs a day?
In the ending, Truman is on the border of the studio.  On one side is a pretty blue sky with a cheerful, although artificial, sun, and on the other side is an open door leading into complete darkness-- the outside ""real"" world.  After a conversation with Christof, he steps through the door, proclaiming a phrase he had used with his next door neighbors every morning, ""In case I don't see ya- good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!""  Inspiring, but like I said, the real issue is whether or not Truman will ever wish he had never found out the truth about the studio world-- he was quite happy until he found out, after all.  I guess it will depend upon what life he makes for himself on the outside.  I think sometimes we want to be deceived or ignorant about things and other times we want the truth.  The truth can hurt and it isn't always ""enlightening.""
The role of Christof introduces themes of God because that's what role he played.  When Truman and his best ""friend"" were sitting watching the artificial sunset, his friend remarked about what a paintbrush He has.  In the end when Christof is talking with Truman, he's speaking from above; Truman can't even see him nor has he ever met him although Christof has been watching him all Truman's life.  An interesting debate is whether or not Christof did Truman more good than harm.  When Truman behaves as he wants him to, Christof is benevolent to him.  When Truman tries to leave the studio, he is very wrathful.  Obviously, Christof's interests are not necessarily the same as Truman's and he decides he is better off rebelling despite Christof's retaliation.  Most of the viewers seem totally happy about Truman's escape from the studio so it seems that he will not be replaced by another character.  Overall, it is an inspiring, thought-provoking, and unique story.  ""The Matrix"" is similar, in that people are put into artificial worlds which exist only on computer.",1024444800,2,3140,4.670909090909091

986422,5,6305183023,"There were rumbling at Paramount Studios in the weeks before the release of The Truman Show. Word was that they knew they had one of the best movies of the year, but feared they had not come up with the right promotional campaign. When I heard this news, I crossed my eyes. How often have we heard that before?
After seeing it, I admitted that they were right to worry. Truman Burbank is no ordinary hero, and the picture is even more extraordinary. It is enormously entertaining and strikingly insightful, but it belongs to no known genre.
As a society, we have a compulsion to pigeonhole everything. The Truman Show has been labeled a comedy, a drama and a combination of both. I think it has elements of the best science fiction, which is a story that has never happened, but which conceivably could. Call it what you will. This movie is easily one of the Ten Best Films of 1998. I wouldn't be surprised if it won Best Picture at the Oscars.
Suppose a television producer were able to create a TV show in which the life of a person was recorded from his birth on. This is the fate of Truman Burbank, brilliant played by Jim Carrey. I've never been caught up in Carrey Mania, but I've usually enjoyed him. My reservation about him has been that, while he is above average in talent, he's previously seemed to play his characters as impersonations of them. The Truman Show is all the proof I need that he can be a true actor. I found myself believing in Truman, not in Jim Carrey as Truman, and that's a tribute to the actor.
We are introduced to Truman at the point where the show, now in its 30th year, is starting to unravel. The subject of this massive TV show, which runs 24 hours a day, lives in the world's largest set, a domed structure that must be five miles across. During the opening credits, we are given a quick history of the show. After that, the first scene shows one of the set's five thousand cameras crashing to the ground. It lands just a few feet from the startled Truman. I think he has known for a long time that his world is somehow wrong. Every attempt to leave, for example, has been thwarted. The shattered camera is the first piece of concrete evidence. Since all the other people in town, including his wife and his friends, are actors, there is not much they can do to help him. This behavior merely reinforces his suspicions.
I don't think I have ever seen a film this short cover so many issues coherently or operate smoothly on so many levels. You can be merely entertained by it, or you can think about the issues it raises, concerning everything from a society that has become totally voyeuristic to the blurring of what is real to the results of our feeble attempts to play God. If you dare, you might consider the notion that, as a group, we are in danger of entertaining ourselves to death.
Don't let the above paragraph put you off. The real magic of The Truman Show is its ability to gratify viewers no matter what level they approach it from.

All in all, it is not surprising that it has been well received by movie critics and moviegoers worldwide. So, why did I give it only two stars? Because its message disturbed me. I know, you might ask, ""How can a movie about freedom possibly disturb you?"" Well, the oppressor's name is Christof (note the similarity to Christ), who forces poor Truman (true man = Adam) to live in this horrible (ironic) perfect town, where everything is just ""plain perfect."" Everything is cool, even though the whole world (think Christof-God and the world-Universe here) knows what Adam... pardon, Truman is doing all the time. Then, Sylvia (read Serpent here) comes along and says, ""Adam, wake up, eat this fruit and you shall become...."" Sorry again, she says, ""Truman, this Garden of Eden is not real, grow up and get outta here."" Truman then sails towards freedom and the cruel Christ(of) tries to stop him by saying. ""Truman, out there you'll find pain and suffering. Stay here in the garden with me."" But since it's cruel to force Truman to remain in such a perfect place, Christof is destined to lose, and Truman finds freedom and Sylvia waiting for him.

Christ(of) doesn't exist, because, if He did, He wouldn't allow all this pain and suffering instead of letting us live in the perfect garden of Eden.""

986425,3,6305183023,"Jim Carrey. What can you say?. You either love him and see his incredible talent, or you hate him and refuse to see or acknowledge his talent. If you fall into the latter, well, that's too bad. Carrey went and tried to do something different with this film. He tried to show that he can act too. If you still don't see it, I recommend you seeing the early 90's TV movie ""Doing Time On Maple Drive"". In this film, Carrey plays Truman Burbank. A seemingly normal guy with a very normal, everyday life. He has a great house in a very picturesque seaside town, a great wife, and a good job. This is real life isn't it?. Then, Truman's world comes crashing down all around him. Everything he knew and had and throught to be true, turned out to be one big lie. Nothing is real. It seems that his whole life has been televised for the whole world to see. This isn't a town. It's a set. everything isn't real. His family members are all actors being paid for the job. The whole operation is being overseen by a producer, played very beautifully by the Oscar nominated Ed Harris, who's always good. At first, Truman thinks he's losing the mind. Then the truth comes out. This is a real showcase for Carrey and his talent. Yes, he is good. Yes, he can act. Yes, he's brilliantly talented. Some people already have their view on him and refuse to let actual truth come to them. It's a real shame. The movie was wonderfully directed with a real airy and haunting feel by Peter Weir. And don't worry Carrey fans, there is some goofball moments that will please the die hard fans of Carrey's comedic work. He should've been nominated for the Oscar. Weir and Harris were, but the star of the movie who made it work wasn't?. Where's the logic in that?. Oh well. ""The Truman Show"" is a fine piece of film.

This movie is sometimes very funny because of the great acting Jim Carrey but the whole content of the story has got a bad mood. The fact that a person is supervised all his life is horrible. But for the spectators Truman becomes part of their life. It's amazing to see that a movie star can become part of a person's life. Everything in Truman's life is fiction and everybody is an actor.

986427,2,6305183023,"This film has features akin to many mediocre science fiction films, in that it establishes an inherently interesting premiss, but fails to portray its protagonist as a credible, fully realised character.  Whatever 'journey' or development this character then undertakes seems obvious and almost inevitable, to the point of being unsatisfying.  The plot becomes similarly devoid of surprises.  Watching this might also be compared with viewing an 'escape' movie (i.e from a prison, or prisoner-of-war camp),  where very quickly you know where everything is headed - the pleasure then becomes that of the details, the mood, and unexpected insights into people's behaviour under stress (see 'Le Trou' for a classic example) - unfortunately, 'The Truman Show' is not strong on any of these counts.
*
Jim Carrey has a very limited talent.  He seems like a caricature of himself, every facial expression, every bodily gesture, being exaggerated.  This is fine for generating a certain kind of humour (Jerry Lewis did something similar), but it seems less than ideal as a technique for evincing audience empathy.  His casting here is regrettable.  I can imagine people leaping to his defence, but just imagine if this film starred an actor capable of rendering a complex personality, a personality riven with conflicting emotions and desires, rather than the 'one-emotion-at-a-time' style of Carrey - think Jeff Bridges (who appeared in Weir's 'Fearless'), or if you want go for broke, a young Marlon Brando.
*
What is more (or less), every other character is limited in depth and humanity.  Ed Harris, blank-faced veteran of such unreflective films as 'The Firm' and 'Apollo 13', gives a one, or possibly two, dimensional performance as producer turned god (perhaps this is forgivable as humanity has never been a notable quality of producers or gods).
*
Weir is at his best being suggestive.  'The Last Wave' is brilliant in this regard.  He's great at certain brooding atmospheres - see also 'Witness', or 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'.  Here, however, he is being didactic (tediously so) and the atmosphere is cheesy grins and half-baked sentimentalism - not his, or anyone else's,  forte.
*
So, be careful with this film.  It seems to have scored high marks with the critics, and technicians such as 'script doctors', because it is 'more intelligent' than the average Hollywood product - well, yes, but when you're talking 'Hollywood' and 'intelligence' then you're talking about a very low average.

986428,4,6305183023,"The story itself is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely not the first to ponder the idea of ""a real life in an fake world"", but ""The Truman Show"" somehow seems refreshingly different from other films using variations this theme.
I'm not sure what makes ""The Truman Show"" so unique. Perhaps its the fact that the ""Big Brother"" of the film is an ordinary flesh-and-blood TV director rather then some powerful futuristic technology (as in ""Matrix"") or some mysterious supernatural force (as in the ""Twilight Zone""). Whether for this reason or another, the story clicks in as a masterpiece.
Based on the storyline alone, this could have been the movie of the year, or even the movie of the decade. Unfortunately, nearly all other aspects of the film are nowhere that good.
Starting with the script. The details of the script of the movie sometimes spoil good points in the story. A good example of this is the very end of the film. The idea for the story's end is excellent, but it looks rather disappointing on film.
As for the acting, it isn't that bad. But it isn't that good either. The guy playing the TV Director Christof is excellent and Jim Carrey is pretty good as Truman, but overall the acting simply isn't that impressive.
Other tidbits prove that the producers didn't think too much about making the film consistent. For example, it says that Truman is ""10913 days on the air, and he was born in front of a live audience"" when it supposed to be near his 30th birthday. This is more than a month off. Just how hard is it to multiply 30 by 365 (or 365 1/4 if you are really picky) and get the right number? It may be unimportant to the plot, but such errors point to the lack of seriousness on the producer's part.
To sum things up:
I give the film 6 stars (that's no typo) for the storyline, and 2 stars for the preformence. Overall, a 4-star movie.",1012521600,,1868,4.513274336283186

Just watch his restrained expression while ""mom"" makes him sit there with the photo album, he is subtle and conveys perfectly that painful moment that we all had to sit through with someone sometime.....but on with the movie, it is interesting, inspiring, entertaining.

He was robbed.",1010793600,,428,5.0
986441,4,6305183023,"I am not a fan of Jim Carrey and I find many of his movies too over-the-top to be worth watching (just watch ""Me, Myself and Irene"" to know what I mean). But Truman Show proves to be the exception to the rule. Intended as a comedy, it turns out to be rather thought provoking and moving. The story follows Truman Burbanks, a 30 year old man who has never left his home town. Unbeknown to him, he lives in a giant studio that is visible from space, was adopted at birth by a movie corporation and is viewed daily by millions around the globe.
In the 21st century, television viewers in general have reached the point where they are fascinated by individual lives, a trait as old as gossip. Watch Big Brother if you don't believe me. Truman Show is impressive in that it portrays this new trend three or four years before it emerges (it was released in 1998). TV junkies and couch potatoes have an infatuation with watching other people run their lives, hence Big Brother, Survivor and such other series.
Personally, I find this a huge waste of time and was not surprised at the recent drop in consumer spending (and hence economy strength) in First World countries - they're all watching TV! Fortunately for the UK and US, Christmas came and everyone suddenly went out buying presents, so the economy was saved.
But getting back to the movie, Truman eventually begins to discover what's happening due to some freakish accidents. A studio light falls from the sky, his car radio changes frequency and begins to follow him around. And there's the mysterious Sylvia who manages to spoil the studio's profits by nearly telling Truman what's up and thus making him more inquisitive.
The Show is brilliant, and definitely a worthwhile watch. It is funny in parts, more sobering in others. We realise how completely oblivious Truman is to his world (initially, at least) and, for those who've never left home, makes us wonder if WE might be a Truman (figuratively of course)",1009929600,,1966,4.6685878962536025

986443,4,6305183023,"I was intrigued by the ingenious premise of this film. The Truman Show represents the ultimate in 'reality' television. Weir manages to pull off a blend of surreal comedy and human drama in a way that a lesser director might not have achieved, managing to keep the two elements in perfect balance without losing the impact of either.
The film is a powerful tale that takes the current trend in reality television to the nth extreme, the story of a man whose life IS a TV show (unbeknownst to him). It lampoons the dangerous direction of current television, a journey which only seems to have accelerated since this movie was made. Manipulation, artificiality, the stifling of creativity and imagination, and the scandalous objectifying of human lives are all exposed in this satire. It shows us where the media is going, though its warnings go unheeded.",1003708800,,853,4.889655172413793
986444,4,6305183023,"I loved this movie even though it was arguably quite sad. Very telling sort of reflection of our society. Jim Carrey was very good as Truman Burbank, a product of the media. He was adopted by a corporation and reared by actors on a ""Truman Show"" set. While the whole world watched his every move, he was oblivious to the fact that the entire world around him was artificial and the people in his life were acting roles. Once he does become ""liberated"" the viewer cannot help but feel afraid for him, having been so sheltered all his life. All the actors here are excellent. Laura Linney delivers a great performance as Truman's wife, Ed Harris plays the ""all-knowing"", artsy director in a beret perfectly, and Jim Carrey is the real surprise. His performance was outstanding, and although many would claim that this was just a subdued version of previous characters he has played, this was not rambunctious, out of control comedy.

986445,1,6305183023,"Out of briefly reading other customers reviews I suspect I am radically different in my opinion from the rest. With that in mind, read this carefully and consider whether you ride my wave or not.
The truth, it's one of my biggest disappointments from a movie in the last couple of years. I'd waited eagerly to see what everybody were so enthralled with, and 'fell on my face'! More than that - I almost fell asleep! It was so boring you can't imagine. I don't understand what is there to be so chilled about. Maybe, the weirdness of the movie is the thing that made it so appealing, I can't come up with anything else.
Those who have seen it and loved it, would never find anything true with what I write, others would accept it cheerfully. I think it's the kind of 'really loved it', or 'really hated it'- the movie generate some kind of an emotional response. It's whether you ride the bullet or not.
In regard of the plot itself, I leave it to Jeff Shannon and his fellows. What I would like to say ,is that ,before hand, I'd thought the idea was fantastic - to dramatize a person's life into a fable ,aiming to show us how deeply our lives are dictated by the media without our attention. I came out so short it was 'devastating', so far away from my vision of it...  You can spare yourself from the disappointment.
 If you're in doubt about seeing/hiring/buying this DVD, ask yourself this question: Do I like/enjoy unconventional movies that are, supposedly, hard to understand literally, sometimes speechless and quiet, have a slow pace that's causing me to run my brain on neutral, maybe, in order to come up with something insightful about this life?",997920000,3,1659,4.545150501672241
986446,5,6305183023,"""The Truman Show"" should take the award for the most original film of the 1990's.  Copycats usually come in twos or threes after a good original work such as this.  It's obvious why others could be jealous, because they didn't think of it first.  But this movie is not just about Truman, it's about everyone's life individually.
If you really want to get the most out of this movie, eat it with ice cream, as eating something pleasant with a movie reinforces your memory of it.  If you watch carefully the subtle interactions between all of the characters, and what Truman did in his spare time, you'll begin to see that he ""was in on it"" sooner than first realized.  What was Truman doing in the yard when Merryl came home with the Chef's pal (when he was digging in the garden)?  Did Truman really believe that Sirius 9 was only a fallen stage light?  These are the subtle clues that allowed him to prepare for his break (from ""reality"") while the producers in the Lunar Room complacency at their pizzas.  ""All unusal activity has to be reported,"" said Christof, and that single blunder allow the storyline to unfold as if each one of us was under the scrutiny of an entire television staff, complete with the God-like voice booming from the clouds that announces...I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it.

986496,5,6305183023,"Upon its release, ""The Truman Show"" was greeted with rapturous reviews--some even hailed it as the best of the decade.  Hyperbolic, you say?  Not at all.  Peter Weir's razor-sharp masterpiece, which was inexplicably denied an Oscar nomination for best picture, may be one of the most underrated movies ever to come out of Hollywood.  That a film this intelligent and provocative could even emerge from the Hollywood system is in itself a minor miracle.
Much has been made of ""The Truman Show's"" subtext, and its timely implications about voyeurism and mass-media exploitation--all of which are entirely appropriate.  What gets lost in the discussion, however, is the fact that on a purely aesthetic level, Weir's film is a mightily impressive achievement.  If by sheer luck you don't yet know the film's much-publicized premise, you are probably in the best position to appreciate the consummate skill with which it unravels.
The key word here is subtlety.  Rather than loudly trumpet what his film is really about (which, unfortunately, is exactly what Paramount did when promoting it), Weir initially frames his subject as an impeccably constructed mosaic, and then proceeds to pull that mosaic apart, piece by tantalizing piece.  Along the way, he employs some ingenious visual tricks and downright hilarious sight gags, so that by the time the big revelation arrives, it's not just a shock device--it's the culmination of an hour's worth of brilliantly sustained storytelling.  That's only the first pay-off.  There are plenty more to come, including a pivotal ""back from the dead"" scene so beautifully acted, so tightly edited, that it gets my vote for the single most riveting sequence of the year (and that includes the first 30 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"").
It's a testament to Weir's skill that ""The Truman Show"" is not only one of the richest and most serious-minded films in recent memory, but also one of the funniest.  The numerous in-jokes--some of which would be the high points of a formulaic comedy but merely function as throwaways here--are truly priceless, and by extracting every possible ounce of humor from the material, Weir smartly avoids turning his movie into a polemic.  Equally impressive is his touch with actors--the criminally underestimated Jim Carrey does the best work of his career as Truman Burbank, while Ed Harris turns in a performance as human as it is chilling.  As Truman's wife and best friend, respectively, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich offer excellent support.

But something is out there and Truman begins to suspect.
As Truman embraces his true self, his explorer self, the part that is stiffled by his false universe, Christof tries to lure him back by having the audacity to present himself as a voice from the heavens. Something that would have great influence on any of us. But the producer is not really God, and the whole cardhouse falls down right then: for the first time in the film, The Girl raises her eyes to heaven and pray's to God ""please"" at about the time Christof blasphemes ""we're on geedee television"".

Who is speaking here? It may be Christof, but the impression created is one so powerful that it could be said to be God speaking. It is hard to say how close the film itself is to reality, but terror and power have always been used for exploitation in the world. Christof illustrates this immeasurable power throughout the whole film, yet the most disturbing fact is that some can and will accept this. Indeed, some, such as Christof, seem to show a complete lack of morality for what they are actually doing - laughing at certain fond memories, which he has `shared' with Truman. He has become so engrossed in what he is performing, that he cannot possibly stand back from the situation and suddenly realise what has happened. Christof can find nothing wrong with the ultimate control he processes - he can control everything apart from Truman himself, yet there are endless avenues of exploitation to combat this, which he has implemented in Seahaven. This is made all too obvious when, at the end of the film, he is willing to make Truman die by using his total power over the environment. He instils a complete and utter terror in the viewer: the terror that this could be a reality.
 One of the most disturbing scenes in the play is when Christof is controlling Marlon, as if he is a puppet. Christof forces Marlon, who has genuinely known Truman for years, to betray his trust: ""And the last thing I would ever do...is lie to you. I mean, think about it, Truman. If everybody's in on it, I'd hafta' be in on it, too. I'm not in on it, because...there is no ""it.""""
The control possessed by Christof is much greater than first imagined. Is it perhaps possible that he may even control the lives of the viewers? Christof tells us that many viewers ""leave him on all night for comfort."" Yet to contrive matters still further, Meryl is now unable to define her screen life from reality: ""The Truman Show is...a lifestyle. It's a noble life. It is...a truly blessed life."" Does Christof really have complete control? There are points where it would appear not: for instance, when Truman sits on the beach and it begins to rain, there is obviously something wrong with the weather system. Neither can he control the real emotions of the actors - he can control everything they do; yet he cannot control their primitive emotions: Meryl breaks down in front of Truman, shouting ""Help me"" to the backstage crew, as well as breaking down when Marlon arrives, distraught about the ""unprofessional"" way in which she is being forced to act. It is these events that Christof cannot control that finally lead to Truman's sudden departure from the island.
When the viewer of the film is first presented with the viewers of `The Truman Show', the experience is one of great confusion. The concept of `worlds within worlds' is not one that is commonly applied to everyday thinking, so it is only when you have viewed the film for most of its length that the concept sets in. In fact, it is almost completely impossible to understand the film after a first viewing, as so many of the small subtleties are dismissed in the first viewing to facilitate some kind of understanding. Examples include the time when Truman is sent to Seahaven harbour by his employer to conclude a case on Harbour Island. It is unclear at this point that the very reason for his visit is to remind him of his fear of water. Another part of the film that is very hard to understand is Truman's obsession with Women's Magazines - we see later that he is collecting eyes and noses etc. to create the face of Sylvia, yet, even after the flashback to his time with her, it is still difficult to link with previous parts of the film.
The viewers (TV) themselves are very satirised, as they mimic a great truth in Western Society. The viewers (TV) have become so engrossed in the world of Truman, that they appear to lead no lives of their own - `The Truman Show' is always viewed at the bar with the waitresses; it is always viewed by the man in the bathtub etc. It is true that we are given only one view of these people, but I think that this is very intentional, as it highlights the growing reality of people becoming more and more engrossed in what are supposedly other people's `real' lives.
The vulnerability of people in this state of `living someone else's life', allows them to also be drawn in by a great deal of commercialism which is presented to them at regular intervals. There are no commercial interruptions in `The Truman Show', so `product placement' must be utilised instead. As the interviewer of TruTalk says: ""Of course everything in the show is available in the Truman Catalogue. Operators are standing by."" The product placement in `The Truman Show' is, of course, very obvious, but it hard to know how much of an impact `product placement' would have on an individual who is so engrossed in the show. There are two very obvious examples: the `greatest hits tape' owned by the waitress and the `Truman cushion' which one of the old ladies owns.
It is at once obvious that Truman is slightly wary of what is happening around him, as the placement really is so obvious: everyday he is forced up against a billboard which advertises a different product each day (Kaiser Chicken/Fine Colonial Homes). To see this board, Truman must be standing very close to it, so that it is included in the shot of him. This is achieved by using two actors who will always stop him at the same point everyday, yet just the second time we see this happening Truman says: ""Well, what a surprise,"" with mild sarcasm, indicating the turbulent nature of events to come.",984009600,,5796,4.605415860735009
986504,5,6305183023,"I have, ever since he was a regular on In Living Color, been a big fan of Jim Carrey. First he did Fire Marshall Bill on the show, then moved to the big screen with Ace Ventura, then Dumb and Dumber, making some of the funniest movies of the 90's. He has become known for making some really crazy films, and has been labeled by many critics inmature and very over-the-top. So it was with great interest that I went to go see Jim Carrey in the Truman Show, a drama directed by Peter Weir, probably best known for directing Dead Poets Society. I had high hopes as well, since it was Weir who directed Robin Williams in that film, a known ""crazy man"", and ended up winning Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards.
Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man who seems to have it all: a beatiful wife, a nice home, a steady job, and friendly neighbors in a nice small island town. But lately, he has been feeling unrest, a yearning, to go out and see the world, escape New Haven and experience life, not just the candy-coated version he had been handed. But it goes much deeper than that, as he soon finds out. His dead father suddenly reappears one day on the street as a homeless man, and after he is carried away by strangers for no reason, Truman starts to question everything around him, including the ones he loves.
For you see, Truman is the center of a great television show, called of course, The Truman Show. His whole life has been a sham, with his family nothing more than actors, and his entire surroundings a giant set in the middle of Los Angeles. The whole world is tuned in to him everyday, 24/7, and has been addicted to the show for over 30 years. There are Truman coffee mugs, Truman pillows, Truman dollhouses based on the real ones on the set, and even Truman bars, where people go to just watch the show. It is nothing short of a world-wide phenomona, created by  Christof, the man who originally came up with the idea and saw to the construction of it. He sees himself as Truman's surrogate father, and truly believes that he is benefiting Truman, as well as the viewing public.
I won't go into too many more details of the plot, for there are those of you who have not seen it. But what I found to be fascinating is not only Jim Carrey's subdued, sympathetic performance, but the moral implications as well. We have today seen the sanctity of marriage destroyed in a ""reality"" program, witness voyeuristically first-hand people's sorrows and personal distasters, and while we say some of these programs are disgusting and against every moral fiber in our bodies, we continue to watch, and give these networks some of the highest ratings they have ever seen outside of the Super Bowl. I think this film raises several good points: how far would we go? And why are we so addicted to our televisions that we need to spend a hundred dollars a month on programming for 300 channels, that we need to catch every word of our favorite programs so we won't be left behind? The Truman Show is a great film to watch time and time again for entertainment, but it is also one of the most important cultural satires to come our way in a long time.
As for the technical aspects of the film, I thought the musical score was brought out fantastically through the 5.1 surround sound. And the colors are supurb, almost life-like. And if you have a widescreen television, you are in luck, because this film has an aspect ratio that goes great with your televisions, no ugly letterbox. You get to see the entire picture in widescreen, but with minimal black bars.",983491200,2,3562,4.471582181259601
986553,5,6305183023,"In today's relam of reality TV, this show would fit right at home.  Wanting to give the audience the ultimate experience of a person's life, but not through the eyes of an actor, Omnicam Corporation adopted a young baby, named him Truman burban, and set him up in a spectacular city encased in a huge dome.  Everything is controlled, form outsiders trying to break into the set, to how Truman is interpreted by his family and friends.
Now, it is some 30 years later, and Truman Burbank is married to the supposed woman of his dreams, is working as an insurance salesman, and everything seems to be going fine: until one day, when a strange object falls from the sky (an optical light, with the label of a major star form the night sky).  As the days go on, Truman encounters more strange and bizarre happenings: a man looking like his father appears, an elevator ina  building seems to just be part of an enclosed set, and a thunderstorm seems only to rain down on HIM!  Pretty soon, Truman is enraptured with the spirit to try and leave the city, of Sea Haven, which he finds that he almost cannot do.  All of these attempts are foiled by the Truman Show mastermind Christof(recipient of multiple emmy awards, as seen on a mantle near the door).  Chritsof has a complex of control over Truman, and tries everything to make sure that he never leaves.
Jim Carrey is the major standout in this film.  He's not an actor, he actually acts like a man unsuspecting of his surroundings (the closest to a down to earth person Carrey had played befor was Stanley Ipkiss in ""The Mask"").  We are as shocked and surprised as he is.  There are some instances where Carrey's humor breaks out, but it is mainly spontaneous and not quite as over the top as his performances in ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Liar Liar.""  This was one film where carrey at least deserved an Oscar nomination, if not the award.",983232000,,1880,4.51622418879056
986554,5,6305183023,"I remember after watching this film for the first time I just looked up at the sky for a long time. It made me think so deeply about myself and the people around me in a way that few other films have managed to do. I have now watched this film about 5 times and each time I notice something new about it. It is first and foremost a media satire. With all of the T.V shows that are devoted to watching how normal people live, this film asks the question ""How far could we go?""
The performances were excellent especially from Jim Carrey and Ed Harris. Ed Harris brings a sensitivity to Cristoph that makes you almost feel sorry for him. When he talks you can sense that he feels he is helping Truman rather than destroying him. I beleive that Jim Carrey is the only person that could have played this role to perfection. He makes Truman such a vulnerable character that you really care about what will happen to him. He also portrays the gradual change that Truman goes through so smoothly and beleivably that I think he definitely deserved an Oscar nomination for the role.
One of the disturbing things I found about this film was the amount of lying that was present. Imagine finding out that the people closest to you including your family had been lying to you for 30 years. You would be absolutely shattered. This is relevant in real life in that close friends who consistently lie and deceive you are no different from Marlon(Truman's best friend) or Meryl(Truman's wife). The different devices used by Cristoph to keep Truman on the island could be seen as the lies that keep us from reaching our full potential.
The direction by Peter Weir is excellent and the story is told so fluently that you will not be bored at all by this film. I find that the closer you look at this film, the more you will find. There are many ideas that fly by when you watch it the first time but become more apparent on multiple viewings.
This would definitely be in my top 10 films of all time.",981331200,8,1980,4.397820163487738
986555,4,6305183023,"It's a great concept! And I can't imagine anyone better suited for the Truman role than Jim Carrey. This whole thing about playing with a real person's life, controlling it and reducing it into some fantasy world... or how is it now... what is real, and what is fantasy, and in whose fantasy is what real, and vice versa?? It is interesting, an interesting (and relevant!) approach to our fake televisionized Big Brother world. And The Truman Show gives the meta theme a lot of humouristic touches as well.
In other words, a great film. BUT it would have been an even greater film if it had ended about six minutes before it does. In my eyes, these unnecessary, and even ruining, last six minutes are typical for USAmerican films. It's like they have to explain everything in every detail in order to make the dim viewer understand what's going on. The punchline and morality would have been far more efficient, and far more frightening, had the film just stopped when Truman... no, I'm not going to tell you; watch the film instead!",979430400,,1033,4.6502732240437155

Titanic won that year and I dislike that film.  But films like Good Will Hunting and LA Confidential are both great.  I still think the Truman show should have been nominated but oh well.  Now on to the film.  This movie is the scariest PG rated movie ever made.  It really makes you wonder if your just someone elses entertainment.  Ed Harris gives a great role playing in a way Trumans ""God"".  The movie tells that it is better to be in the real world where there is pain and suffering than to be in heaven and have it fake.  That's a concept that rises above most of the crap I've ever seen.",979171200,,734,4.171428571428572
986557,5,6305183023,"This is one of my favorite movies in recent history.  Jim Carrey here joins Robin Williams (""Dead Poets Society,"" etc.) and Michael Keaton (""Batman,""  ""Pacific Heights,"" etc.), to be counted among the few comic actors who have managed a foray into the world of drama with spectacular success...  The basic idea of this film, as in all likelihood whoever is reading this already knows, is that Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man whose entire life has been surreptitiously filmed, and made into a sort of global media cult...  He is almost completely unaware of this, although now and then he has gotten an inkling that something's up.  Everything about this movie is perfect -- even Truman's name is a perfect mix -- ""True Man"", which is what he is finally becoming, mixed with ""Burbank"", the home of the phoniest people alive, the Hollywood establishment.
I think one of the most important parts of this film is that Truman is turning 30 years old.  There is something about that age that, in my experience, really does involve a reassessment of all kinds of things in one's life.  There is a questioning that goes on, as well as a sort of heightened awareness of the social games around you that are really traps, if you think about them.  Some of them are traps that are probably worth fighting to stay locked up in, but now I'm revealing my bourgeois bias.  Be that as it may, given the general theme of becoming aware of perhaps living in some kind of fool's paradise --  if the main character of this movie were 16 years old, the movie would probably resemble ""Pump Up the Volume.""  If the main character were 23, the movie might resemble ""The Matrix.""  But the kind of awakening that happens in the early 30s is what's being captured here, and the director Peter Weir does everything perfectly.
A couple things I wanted to say -- Noah Emmerich is terrific as the buddy, Marlon, who shows up with a six pack at crisis moments, to keep Truman's brain anaesthetized.  Noah seems to get typecast a little in the ""buddy"" role, he played a similar part in ""Beautiful Girls.""  He does have a good look for that kind of role.  Oh well, I guess it's a living...  I also wanted to say that while it's easy to identify with Truman, breaking free of the lies that have bound his mind, I think anyone watching this should also ask themselves whether they've ever played the part of Cristoph, the director-overseer of the artificial world who keeps lying to Truman, to make Truman's ""happiness"" his (Cristoph's, not Truman's) responsibility.  I have done this in my life.  Looking at this movie, I identify at least as strongly with Cristoph as with Truman.  Probably even more.  This is the kind of mentality which could lead to someone becoming a mental abuser of a partner in any relationship -- romantic, familial, workplace, or what have you...  The killer storm that Cristoph invokes at the end, especially, reminded me of the kind of tantrum any controlling person might throw, if they could, to keep another human being under their thumb...  Cristoph made his decision to keep lying forever to the person who made his own ""happiness"" possible.  If anyone reading this is involved in any symbolically similar behavior, take a cue from this movie and change your ways while there's still time, and set the Truman in your life, whoever it is, free.  Just a thought.
Fox Mulder, on the ""X-Files"" once famously mentioned that ""a choice given to many men is the choice between being a slave in heaven, or a master in hell.""  The ending of this movie opens up the prospect of an exciting third possibility -- to be oneself, neither master nor slave, but a free being.  As long as you maintain a kind, gentle heart, which Truman clearly does, everyone should have that right.  This movie rules.  Absolutely worth owning.",978307200,6,3816,4.680659670164918

So I found new aspects of him. I came to like him more seeing the movie.  This moviefs story is as follows. Trumanfs life is broadcasted to nation wide. He has only imitation fiends and family. But he has not noticed those things. So he thinks he spends a normal life. But one day he has doubts about his circumference. He tries to discover the truth. In the end, he goes into the real world out of the imitation life.  My favorite scene is the final scene. He goes out to the actual world from the world which gives absolute safety to him. He chooses the actual world. It is very exciting so I took an enormous liking to the scene. Another scene I like is the scene in which people are watching Trumanfs life on television.

986559,5,6305183023,"I really enjoyed ""The Truman Show"", saw it twice, and wish Carrey had been recognized by the Academy for his acting.  When I first watched ""Truman"", I thought the movie's premise seemed familiar, and indeed, if you read Philip K. Dick's SF novel  ""Time Out Of Joint"", you'll see many similarities, even down to the button worn by a character who breaks into the movie set to tell Truman that he is in a TV show. Also, in both the book and movie, the main characters are in a grocery store and test the theory that everyone is watching them by surprising everyone in the store and noticing that they all react to surprise in a very organized manner, as a unit. In Dick's novel, the main character, Ragle Gumm, lives in a 50's suburban town and spends his days playing the local newspaper's daily puzzle, and slowly but surely, his reality unravels, and he thinks everyone is looking at him and talking about him...not to totally give away the story, but it turns out everyone IS looking at him and talking about him.  The reasons for making Ragle and Truman the center of attention are different, but the stories are so similar. If you've never read Philip Dick's stories (the movies ""Bladerunner"", ""Screamers"", and ""Total Recall"" are all based upon his works) please give them a try - he is one of the greatest novelists to have ever tackled the question, ""What is real?""",976492800,2,1371,4.587755102040816

986620,5,6305183023,"As you will know by now, this is the surrealistic movie of a man who's grown up in a controlled environment, his life broadcast on television, and with every aspect of his life planned by a corporation. It's a story with many levels of questions and interpretations, from the obvious to the existential. How far would television executives go for ratings? How much right does the public have to know all the details of someone's life? How much are we controlled by others? What is the nature of reality?
However, simply as an allegory for middle-class life, it works extremely well and is deeply moving. When Truman begins to yearn to know more of the world, the people around him conspire to keep him in his claustrophobic environment, using guilt and manipulation. He has an aging mother, he has a job, he has a mortgage, he has friends, he has a wife who wants a baby - he is expected to be settled and happy. When he tries to interject a change of routine into his life despite their admonishments, he's thwarted by `acts of God'. Jim Carrey was perfectly cast as Truman, making the innocence and wistfulness of the character believable, as was Ed Harris as the god-like director who's both loving and wrathful towards his creation. The 1950's look to the controlled environment harks back to a time many people still think of as domestically ideal, a time when we had no doubts in our beliefs of what was right and proper and what wasn't.
But perhaps the simplest message in it is that until we can overcome the expectations and limitations others impose on us, we will never be free.",970617600,3,1589,4.618374558303887

We can't get  out of this solar system.  The sun is rigged Out There.  Just as Truman  could never sail to Fiji, no human can live long enough to transverse  interstellar space to Alpha Centuri Proxima, the nearest star.  Before the  gods we must have demigods in the form of those looking over us, real or  imagined.  Does it make any difference?  And as Christof says, we accept  the reality that is given us, so we could be fooled.
Anyway, ""The  Truman Show"" begins with a startling premise marvelously presented.  The  script by Andrew Niccol is a work of art and the direction by Peter Weir  sure-handed and seamless.  He allows the story to unfold at a convincing  pace and the fifties cum nineties TV Americana feel to the ""Seahaven"" sets  is delightful.  Jim Carrey is perfect as Truman Burbank, the poor sap in a  fishbowl.  Everything about his life, including his wife and best friend  are totally fake (try that on for size).  Ed Harris as the megalomanic TV  artist Christof is creepy enough, although the scenes with him are  ironically less convincing than those in Truman's world.  I thought he came  across a little too much like a mad scientist.  Laura Linny as Carrey's TV  wife/product spokesperson with the ever present TV smile is wonderful, and  good too is his estranged girl friend, Natascha McElhone with the big  eyes.
Some unanswered questions.  We know there is a camera in the  bathroom.  Do they switch to another shot when he is using it or does the  world-wide audience watch him move his bowels?  And is his wife a ""whore""  as well as a TV actress or is their relationship purely Platonic?  Does the  audience see them together in the bedroom?  Does she have a life away from  him?  Weir chose not to address these questions.
Although the premise  looks a little messy when examined closely, the inspired and completely  apropos ending is as crisp and clean as the dot at the end of this  sentence.",967766400,,2141,4.629032258064516
986624,5,6305183023,"Four out of the five movies nominated for the Best Picture Oscar of 1998 deserved to be there, in my opinion. Take out 'The Thin Red Line' and add  in 'The Truman Show', and the Academy would have actually gotten the top  lineup right.
'The Truman Show' is an exceptional movie, partly because  it could have gone so wrong. The premise could easily come across as some  episode off of ""The Twilight Zone"", and ""everybody""  knows that Jim Carrey in the lead role makes this a comedy. Well, it didn't  turn out that way.
Jim Carrey, in this movie, shows (once again) that he  can do some excellent dramatic acting. His character has traces of Jim's  wacko roles from the earlier movies that so many viewers define him by, but  this works. Truman Burbank has been raised in a totally unnatural  environment, and Jim Carrey shows the damage that this has caused in the  character. He is like a bomb which can go off at any second, and which does  go off during the course of the movie.
Similarly, the rest of the movie  succeeds by walking just at the edge of ludicrousness. The very careful  handling of the story by director Peter Weir, and the restrained  performance of Ed Harris and the rest of the cast keeps us at the very edge  of our suspension of disbelief. The story is bizarre, but just within the  realm of possibility for your mind to accept.

They assumed that his innocence and happiness was the  common Jim Carrey-goofiness, and unfortunately they overlooked the most  brilliant aspect of Carrey's acting.  Truman Burbank was brought up in a  perfect world, and for this reason, Carrey portrays him as happy, yet not  quite satisfied with his life.  Every time Carrey smiles to his neighbors,  his friends, or his wife, you can see a true emptiness within his eyes that  only talented actors can produce.  The Truman Show also has a wonderful  supporting cast with the performances of Ed Harris, Laura Linney, and  Natascha Mcelhone.  My personal favorite was Laura Linney, who portrayed  the perky wife/obsessed actress whose job it was to live with a man whom  she couldn't stand, not to mention act as an advertiser for the show's  sponsors.  While the performances in the movie were superb, the plot  undoubtedly unveils the greatness of this film.  Packed full of  philosophical inquiry and the realization that no one can be sure of the  assumed truth around them, this film leaves the audience thinking about  their own worlds long after they have left the theater or shut off the VCR.

For example Truman must be kept on the island, for the show to continue.  So when Truman heads to a travel agency to inquire about an airline ticket  to Fiji, there are posters of burning planes plummeting from the sky on the  walls.
Once Truman begins to figure out that his life is being  manipulated, Carrey shines with a combination of poignancy, manicness, and  a wide range of emotion.  Truman faces a choice of freedom vs security,  self-determination vs fate, and truth vs denial.

  The plot centers around a man named Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey.  From his birth, he has been the subject of a TV show in which everyone he  knows is not really who he thinks  they are, but merely actors playing a  role.  He alone is unaware of this fact.
  As the movie progresses, he  gradually becomes aware that all is not right.  From the very beginning,  when a camera with the ID of ""Sirius"" falls from the sky,  narrowly missing him, he notices strange things happening.

986692,5,6305183023,"You will believe.
When I first heard about The Truman Show I was less than enthused with the idea of a tv show documenting the entire life of an individual.  Particularly with everything about that individual's life  being staged or simulated.  Like most garbage coming out of Hollywood it  was entirely too fake.
What I viewed however was a film with so much  humanity and lack thereof that it's hard not to get drawn in to the reality  of Truman's all too simulated world.
To me the major question that the  film raises is what kind of society would not just tolerate but condone  this type of undertaking.  And perhaps an even bigger question is how  plausible is it that our present society would react just like the  characters in the movie.  The answer may be very disconcerting.  Or how  about the ethical lack of privacy issue and the audacity of any individual  to invade another's privacy in such a manner.  Or the low morals  particularly of Laura Linney's character who can at best be described as a  prostitute.
Forget about the legalities of such an undertaking, the film  (in my mind) raises the morality question of playing God and the lack of  morality of the viewing public.  Only 1 character in the whole film even  remotely thinks of Truman as a real person and not an object of amusement  or a creation.  He merely exists for their own pleasure or sympathy.
Yet  Truman, despite all that is stacked against him endeavors to break free and  know the truth.  One man... following his own voice despite all the signs  to the contrary.  To me that's powerful stuff.
Jim Carey is phenomenal.  It's too early to tell but he may be that rarest of individual who can be  great at both comedy and drama.

I'm really a huge admirer of Peter Weir's films.  ""Witness"" and ""The Last Wave"" are among my favourite  movies, but ""The Truman Show"" unfortunatelly could not fullfill  my expectations. I think that it has some great moments, but it tries to be  too many movies at once. The film isn't satisfied in being a satire, it  also wants too deal with larger issues, but this would require an extra  movie. Weir reveals too early, that Truman Burbank is just living in a  large TV show. That creates a distance between us and him, which I think  hurts the movie. We are introduced to the director of the show named  Christoph (very significant name, isn't it?), a character that is  overwritten and overplayed.

Truman is played to perfection by an actor who I've  never thought that he could actually act, Jim Carrey.

Ed Harris' Christof is one of those characters that will  live forever in the hearts of the audience, and Truman, well, Truman is  perhaps the most upright, honest and sweet hero that Hollywood ever  conceived.

I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out why this film was beat out by ""Shakespeare in Love"",  and why Jim Carey, who turned in the best performance of his career in  ""The Truman Show"", wasn't even nominated for best actor.
The  plot of this movie is simple enough-Jim Carey plays a young man whose  entire life has been entertainment for the rest of the world.  He dares to  reach beyond the giant bubble which is his universe to see what's out  there, only to be foiled.
Of particular note is the scene toward the  end of the film where Truman reaches the end of the dome shaped studio and  is told by Christoph (Ed Harris) about his world.  This stands out as one  of the most magical scenes in an extraordinary motion picture.
I realize  that this movie isn't for everyone (my wife, for one, didn't particularly  like it), but Carey's performance alone justifies the purchase of this  video.  He displays a vulnerability and childlike fascination that is  unlike anything I've ever seen.  A very good supporting cast includes the  shamefully overlooked Ed Harris, as well as Laura Linney.

I've heard both gushing adoration and  invective-based indictment of this film, so I wished to make a clear-headed  assessment.  I loved the film but very much disliked the star that plays  the central character of this character-based science-fiction allegory.
I  am well aware that Carrey was probably the reason that an  anti-establishment piece like this got greenlit.  Unfortunately, he was  wrong for the role.  The masterstroke thematic and narrative argument of  this film is that a genuine, everyday person can be the emotional salvation  of millions of robotic, brainwashed people around the world.  By casting  Carrey, who has not as single genuine bone in his whole acting technique,  Peter Weir compromised Truman's humanity, upon which hangs his whole  film.
That aside, The Truman Show is a film of stunning craft -- from the  Dagwitz/Glass score to Peter Biziou's amazing photography; from the  flawless production design to Andrew Niccol's top-notch script; and the  supporting players, led by a flaky Laura Linney (showing much comic  ability) and the low-key, infallible Ed Harris.  A brilliant touch casting  Harris as a godhead -- when the facade of the God is ripped down, Harris'  crushed reaction is brilliant.
From a purely aesthetic viewpoint  (film-industry practices aside), this film could've benefitted from a  non-name star.  As it stands, it remains a noble and worthy film,  qualifying as one of the best of the last four or five years, if only based  on its technical merits alone, and a truly challenging film.",933552000,2,1708,5.24907063197026
986840,2,6305183023,"When I found out Jim Carrey was devastated upon hearing the news he was not nominated for an oscar for his performance in ""Truman"", i wondered what all his fuss was about.  Gee Jim, whatcha gonna do now, run  off and kill yourself?  Get over it and stop pouting, your performance  wasn't that great and to make matters worse the entire movie was certainly  not worthy of any oscar recognition in my opinion.  Fact of the matter is,  ""Truman Show"" is a mediocre film about a man being watched by  millions of onlookers.  Well let me tell ya, this onlooker would have  changed the channel, okay!",932774400,2,593,4.509433962264151
986890,4,6305183023,I saw The Truman Show 3 times in the theaters. It was nothing I ever expected. I thought it was going to be like all the other Carrey movies. He has definently changed. I believe he wants to move up into the adult field  of mind. He has always done movies for little children. He really wants to  grow up.,931824000,,305,4.066666666666666

This movie shows that Jim is not going to stay in on one level thoughout his movie career  but instead improve and become more versetile.  If you see only one of his  movie, see this one.
I also liked Liar Liar, very funny movie.",930700800,,356,4.0285714285714285
986894,5,6305183023,"After ""Cable Guy"" I never really thought I would see another such scarey comedy. Along come ""The Truman Show"" with the vastly underrated (why was he not nominated for and Oscar?) Jim Carrey again  giving the kind of performance that is not only rare but barely exists in  movies outside of Europe and certainly never seen in american film.  Carrey's cartoon persona brilliantly matches Peter Weir's vision of a life  permanently on line. The""Oh my God"" factors leap at you as an  unsuspecting audience and treat you as an intelligent beast instead of  feeding the usual predicatable pap we have grown accustomed to. See this  movie and then watch it again immediately afterwards.",930614400,,679,4.95575221238938
986964,2,6305183023,"It still baffles my mind that critics like Siskel and Ebert found this movie extraordinary. I remember Roger Ebert actually saying ""movies like this one were why he became a critic in the first place."" The  whole idea behind this movie is a great one, but the story itself is what  makes this movie only a faint memory in my mind. Here's a big problem, most  every camera shot used was that of the perspective of what an actual T.V.  viewer of The Truman Show would see. This makes it hard for us as the  viewer to really get close to Truman's character. And another note, do we  need to have the T.V. show creator's name be Christos, the symbolism in  this movie is enough to choke a horse. If you want to see a really good  movie that is along these lines rent EdTV, I'll grant you it is not a high  concept movie, but I found myself more enthraled with the characters and  the story than in The Truman Show. And if you think Carrey should have been  nominated for Best Actor for this, rent The Cable Guy and see what an  excellent actor he really is.",928454400,,1053,4.236180904522613

You won't think of him as ""Jim Carrey the Goofball"", yet the sparkle is still in his eyes. By far a brilliant  pick for the star role in this wonderful film that will (excuse the  cliche') make you laugh and cry at the same time, and walk out of the  theater feeling happy and triumphant.  As I have read several times in the  other reviews, see it once, then see it again, believe me, you missed a lot  the first time.",925171200,,508,4.175257731958763

987067,5,6305183023,"Since most of the viewers comments that I've read are positive, it does make me wonder how there could be anyone who rated this movie only one star!  Even the famous critic Leonard Maltin thinks the old  Twilight Zone  was ""better"".  I admit, I am an old Twilight Zone fan, and this  movie did remind me of it, but the big difference here was in  ""Truman's"" world there was no mysticism, just a chilling look at  how a person's life, if starting at birth, could be so totally manipulated  by ""well meaning"" people.  Slavery was abolished in Abe Lincoln's  day, yet we see in this film a young man being ""owned"" by a  studio, with people scurrying here and there, ready to grab off the scene  anyone who might reveal the truth and thereby ruin the revenues of this  commercialized society.  As a non-Mormon living in Utah, this movie  screamed at me the ""reality"" of the Mormon church.  Just as  Truman accepted without question (for a time) the ""truth"" of his  actually false world, I see otherwise highly intelligent people every day  who ""know"" that the Mormon ""Church is true,"" because it  has been presented to them as truth since the beginning of their lives.  Just as heartbreaking as Truman's fabricated existence.  And just as Truman  was discouraged from traveling (so that he wouldn't discover the truth on  his own) these people are discouraged from reading anti-Mormon materials  (for the same reason).  My advice to them, and to anyone who feels like a  Truman--Read the Bible for yourself, and see the reality that has not been  shown to you thus far in life!  This movie was definitely worth watching!",923270400,4,1616,4.691756272401434

But Paramount has screwed up YET  AGAIN.  They did it wit hEvent Horizon, and thye did it again with  Truman... *NO BONUS MATERIALS*.  Oh yeah, we get 2 trailers, *BUT THAT'S  IT*.
This movie SCREAMS for commentary.  It's what DVDs were MADE FOR!  Heck, I think they probably had a WHOLE LOT of cut scenes on the cutting  room floor, but did they include them?  *NO*.

It is neat to notice all the little  commercials that are shown throughout the movie.  It is also nice to see  how the bible was brought into it by hollywood.  The director was in some  way like GOD, in the way that he controlled Jim's life, and especially when  he was talking from the heavens at the end.  Also, Jim was just like Adam,  trying to leave the Garden of Eden, to reach Eve, who was played by Sylvia.
