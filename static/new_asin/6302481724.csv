7826521,5,6302481724,"For some reason when WCW or the NWA used to release videos back in the day they would only release part of the event and cut matches.  Most of the tapes run 120 mins and I guess that's why they did it, so they could make sure they ran 120 mins.  Unfortunatly for this event it hurts it because this is a solid event.  I own the complete event and I wish they would have kept this one complete.  There are five matches included.  The first one is a great match featuring Brian Pillman defending the WCW Light heavyweight title against Scotty Flamingo.  This is a solid match that is shown in its entirety.  Solid action and it's kind of cool to see a future Raven as someone like Scotty Flamingo.  Good match.

They also include the Sting vs. Cactus Jack match in a falls count anywhere match.  Surprisingly, the match was not for the WCW world title but it was a great match nonetheless.  I remember reading that for many years Mick Foley (Cactus) thought this was his best match.  It was a great match with some very stiff and hard hitting moves.  Really great to see Sting challenged.  I would have liked to have seen more matches with these two.

The next match was the Ricky Steamboat vs. Rick Rude 30 mins Iron Man match.  This is truly one of the greatest matches of all time.  These two just put it all on the line.  It is fast paced and just awesome to watch.  I love how Rude sacrificed the first fall by getting himself DQ'd just so he could punish Steamboat even more.  Fantastic match, but honestly, is there a bad Steamboat match?  I have yet to see one.  This is one that I wish we could see the talent of today put on.  They don't make'em like this one anymore.

They also included the six man tag match with Dustin Rhodes, Barry Windham and Nikita Koloff taking on Bobby Eaton, Arn Anderson and Steve Austin of the Dangerous Alliance.  This is a very good match but WCW cuts most of the match and you only get to see like five mins of it.  That's a shame cause it really is a great match.

The final match they include is the main event with the Steiners taking on the Miracle Violence Connection of Dr Death Steve Williams and Terry Bam Bam Gordy.  The match goes to a 30:00 time limit draw but WCW cuts out like four mins or something.  Again, it's a shame cause this match is freaking awesome.  It is one of the stiffest and hardest hitting matches I have ever seen.  From the opening bell, these four guys just go all out against each other and when the bell rings, we still don't know who the best team in the world is.  This match is actually one of my favorite tag matches of all time.  Just great action.

There are a couple of lackluster matches that are not included on the tape and for good reason.  The first is Ron Simmons taking on Terry Taylor which is an ok match but nothing more.  The next one is Greg Valentine taking on Marcus Alexander Bagwell.  This match was pure boredom and I am glad it was not included on the VHS tape.  The last they don't include, which I think should have been, was Madusa taking on Missy Hyatt in a biniki contest.  I liked this contest and it was fun to watch.  I have to say that at this time Missy may have been the best looking woman in wrestling and it is a crime not to include this one on the tape.

All in all, the tape is very well done, but it's always good to have a complete event.  This is one I would recommend to anyone, simply because there are some classics and because I honestly don't think WCW had a bad pay per view in 1992.  I give this one 5 stars!",1351555200,,3534,4.196428571428571
7826522,5,6302481724,"Thanks to another old tape that I was able to get from a friend, I was able to see WCW's first beach style PPV card that would be replaced in 1994 by the name ""Bash At The Beach"" entitled Beach Blast '92. Now once again, during this time WCW would edit their cards down to two hours so most of the filler undercard matches would be removed along with at times the main matches being edited down to fit the tape. However since I have the actual event, I am not sure what has been edited.

WCW Light Heavyweight Champion Brian Pillman vs Scotty Flamingo. For those hardcore fans that may not know, Flamingo would go on to greater success in ECW known as Raven. This was a different style of a match than the Pillman/Liger series as they focused more on mat wrestling with an occassional high-flying move coming about with a few moments to check out being Flamingo taking a suplex off the apron onto the concrete floor & the final dive that Pillman took that had him land on his head on the ramp that would play a factor in this encounter as it was just a great mat-wrestling match with a nice pace throughout.

Ron Simmons vs Terry Taylor. This was the beginning of a big singles push for Simmons as with the exception of a few moments here & there, this match was dominated by Simmons who used his power & football offense to get the victory.

Greg Valentine vs Marcus Bagwell. This was another match that was just real short & nothing really noteworthy past this being the last WCW PPV appearance of Greg Valentine (that I know of anyways).

Around this part, there was the beginning of the first major attraction of the night and it wasn't even a match as it was contested throught the rest of the night. It was a Bikini contest between Madusa of the Dangerous Alliance against Missy Hyatt. This was a foreshadowing for the WWF's verison of this contest in late '90s as both women came out to different outfits to the approval of the crowd with Johnny B. Badd and Jesse Ventura getting in on the action for comedic reasons.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: WCW Champion Sting vs Cactus Jack. This was a non-title match since Vader was scheduled to battle Sting for the title at the next PPV but the story behind this match was that Sting was returning from his rib injury at the hands of Vader against the man who wanted to take Sting out for his own sick pleasure. This was Cactus's best WCW match as the action started on the ramp with both men going all over the place with moves like Jack doing a sunset flip off the apron, Sting delivering a suplex in the crowd, both men using the ramp to their advantage & even taking hard shots onto the railing with the storytelling of Cactus working on Sting's previous injured ribs.

Iron Man Challenge: Ricky Steamboat vs Rick Rude. This was the SuperBrawl rematch with the stipulations being that there would be nobody at ringside for either man, the match would have a 30 minute time limit with the winner being the man who gains the most falls at the end of the 30 mins. This is one of those matches that I consider to be a lost classic encounter & my favorite match of the night as these two put on a tremendous performance. The story was well told early as Rude had his ribs injured early that lead to him gaining a few falls early including giving up a fall just to hurt Steamboat (the whole top-rope DQ rule for those wondering) & keep the advantage. The action was back & forth constantly as Steamboat fought like a champion to comeback & even the score before the last thirty seconds really pushed the limits of both men resulting in a very intense finish to what was again, a lost classic encounter between two legends.

Barry Windham, Dustin Rhodes & Nikita Koloff vs The Dangerous Alliance. This team of the Dangerous Alliance was the team of ""Stunning"" Steve Austin, Arn Anderson & Bobby Eaton. This was one of those multi-tag matches where there was constant action from both ends with the Alliance using heel tactics & Paul E. Dangerously to keep the edge along with a tease of friction between Rhodes & Windham that would become a factor in the upcoming months. The ending was a bit cheap (the whole top-rope DQ rule crap) but this was still a good six man tag that not satisfied the fans but also wanted you to see more.

WCW Tag Team Champions The Steiner Brothers vs Dr. Death Steve Williams & Terry Gordy. For Japanese wrestling, this was a dream match but this was really a dream match for anyone who knows their tag team wrestling history. The Steiners started off early with a flurry of offense before Williams & Gordy tried to slow the pace causing Rick & Scott to do the same in that respect. Both teams decided to use the same tag team tactics in trying to cut the ring in half & keep the fresh man out of the match with Scott's arm being heavily focused. They went the 30 min. time limit as it was just classic tag team wrestling from start to finish with the outcome promising a rematch that I am sure fans wouldn't have mind after seeing this. ""As a side note"" their rematch was actually at the next Clash Of The Champions which resulted in Scott Steiner getting injured, cutting this feud short.

Overall, this event along with SuperBrawl & The Great American Bash were my favorite WCW cards from 1992. There were only two filler matches but those matches didn't last long with every other match being a standout contest whether it came to light-heavyweight action, hardcore, & tag team wrestling. I highly recommend this card to anyone who is able to find it.",1301097600,,5532,4.447731755424063
7826523,4,6302481724,"This is a great tape. There's one match that's plain boring(Rhodes/Rude) and another one that was good(Hollywood Blondes/Arn and Roma) although Brian Oillman ripped his tights to reveal his anus and Paul Roma fell over when a drop kick missed him by 2 feet.

Otherwise, this is an awesome tape. A minor detail about this show that I've noticed about no other is the lighting. It was awesome. I don't know what exactly they did on the technical end but something about it was special.",1125014400,,483,4.682352941176471
