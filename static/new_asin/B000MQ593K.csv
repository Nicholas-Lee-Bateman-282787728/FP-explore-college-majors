2738437,4,B000MQ593K,My daughter loves the sesame street characters and they are really educational. She has learnt her ABCs from Sesame Street.,1223337600,,123,5.2
2738438,3,B000MQ593K,My kids love the new Abby Cadabby. I thought she was in this all of the videos in this new video pack. She is only in one.  This is what I bought it for since we have other Elmo videos. The kids still like them.,1213574400,8,211,3.688888888888889
2738439,5,B000MQ593K,"These are great learning DVD's for children.
They are a series of different episodes that were aired on TV, so it provides a large variety of material to help children learn.",1207353600,,174,4.645161290322581
2738440,5,B000MQ593K,"TV Fun Pack Volume 1 and 2 are packs of episodes from the 2006-2007 season. Now that Genius is handling the DVD distribution of Sesame Street, they should produce seasdon sets, so we can get uncut episodes for our children to watch. These TV Fun packs are a great value. It's a shame there aren't more out there.",1198713600,12,312,4.396551724137931
2738441,5,B000MQ593K,"This is the perfect gift for parents of toddlers and preschoolers. My 4-yr-old son came from China in May and he already knows all of SS's letters and numbers of the day, and he has learned words and whole phrases from the episodes. Admittedly, he watches these videos over and over (and over and over and over), but they're great educational tools and you don't have to worry about violence, sex, guns, or the underrepresentation of most any groups (at least in the newest skits). Yes - I have to read while he watches SS because I now know every single line, but long after his love for other movies has gone, he still clings to SS. I have nothing bad to say about SS.
My highest recommendation!",1185062400,19,697,4.453125
2738442,5,B000MQ593K,"Very fun episodes, my daughter loves Sesame Street and really enjoyed these DVDs. Especially the one where Abby is introduced to the crew. We adore Elmo!",1451174400,,153,4.923076923076923
2738443,5,B000MQ593K,"my granddaughter loves Sesame Street, and this DVD really enjoyable . My granddaughter is16 months old.
On a previous purchase from Amazon I purchased a compact non-breakable DVD player and it comes with case and car attachment which has been fantastic..
my granddaughter's parents only let her watch TV or DVD's while en-route ( car or plane ) and she loves to get in the car now as she
can watch Sesame Street DVD's. she used to cry and hate the car now she can't wait to get in.
Very educational, and she loves them.",1447891200,3,519,4.473684210526316

2738446,5,B000MQ593K,"I'm giving this 5 stars bc it is exactly what I ordered. However I have a complaint which is please please please release some newer seasons. I almost regret buying bc it is a lot different than what she is used to watching on her daily shows... But I figure she will learn to love the tapes in the times we have to watch in the car or at a friends. Now I will say money going in a great direction!

2738451,5,B000MQ593K,"These three episodes are great. I have been out of the loop and had no idea prior to this year who Abby even was not to mention where she came from. I loved seeing the episode where she moves to Sesame Street to give me some background. Also, I love anything with Amy Sedaris so also a fantastic episode.",1235174400,5,304,4.169491525423729
