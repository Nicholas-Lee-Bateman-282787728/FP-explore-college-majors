1808409,5,B00007ELDU,My 6 year old nephew saw it 3 times on the first day itself. He loves the singing and dancing!,1250812800,,94,3.75
1808410,5,B00007ELDU,"We purchased this video for our 3 yr old twins.  They love it!  The DVD auto starts and auto replays, so you don't have to do anything other than pop it in the machine for them.  However, I would recommend purchasing more than one title, unless you like listening to the same 10 songs for hours.

Songs include:
Hound Dog
Talk to the Animals
Five little monkeys
Racoon & Possum
Over in the Meadow
The Bear went over the Mountain
The Kicking Mule
The Farmer in the Dell
The Old Hen
See you Later, Alligator",1231632000,9,505,4.28421052631579
1808411,4,B00007ELDU,"I purchased this tape for my Kindergarten class to watch during Snack time and ""down"" time. It seems to be great for this age group, and perhaps ages from 3 to 8 would enjoy the songs, and ""vitual zoo/farm trips"" as they have fun learning as well. Many songs are familiar, and the children join right in.  I like to combine music with teaching, and Kidsongs do a great job. I especially like Kidsongs series because of the positive messages they send.",1142985600,2,451,4.5
1808412,5,B00007ELDU,My 18-month old and I really enjoy settling down with this video.  He points out all the different animals and will make the accompanying animal noises.  The songs are very entertaining and he'll even dance to some of them. Highly recommended.,1049068800,7,243,4.902439024390244
