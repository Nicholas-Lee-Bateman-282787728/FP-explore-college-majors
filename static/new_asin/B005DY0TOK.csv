I enjoyed hearing her narrate the cute movie Mooch Goes to Hollywood, seeing her scene in Frankenstein's Great Aunt Tillie, her appearance on General Electric Theater, and the four movie trailers that were included. Zsa Zsa is my idol and to have a DVD that is all about her is awesome! The quality of the footage is not the best, but it is older footage after all, which makes it understandable that it would not be superb quality. Everything was still enjoyable to watch and I do recommend this DVD to everybody that doesn't already have it. The DVD appears to be out of print and seems to be getting harder to find, so if you want it, I suggest purchasing it soon before it becomes impossible to obtain.",1452556800,,780,4.386206896551724

This was a big dissapointment, NO Johnny Carson interviews!!, not even an old Jack Paar or obscure Merv Griffin maybe, since her sister Eva, appeared more on Merv probably than Zsa Zsa seeing how they had ""a relationship"".I was secretly hoping for the Howard Stern show appearance she made--it was GREAT!!.No court tv clips from the early 90's when she smacked the police!!!.Nada, zilch. So you ask, WHAT do you get!?, not a whole lot, a kinda cute film ""Mooch goes to hollywood""a 1971 film with Zsa Zsa narrating,and a bunch of stars doing cameos,Mooch is a dog(as in canine NOT the film necessarily),4 film trailers; Moulin Rouge,Queen of outer space, The Naked Truth and We're not Married. Also a t.v. appearance with Jack Benny a G.E. show with Ronald Reagan as host,this particular film with Ronald Reagan is very washed out and blurry,a very poor print. Oh well, maybe someday someone will come up with a dvd to do justice to the great Zsa Zsa,it could happen, it definately ""ain't happening "" on this dvd.",1323043200,8,1255,4.892018779342723
