3587657,4,B001FOPOD8,"What a fun ride. And I say that once I found myself laughing when the credits rolled (and not in a bad way).

A plot description is almost pointless, but we will stick with it being a time travel film involving and affecting only four characters. Our lead stumbles upon a time machine near his country home and unfortunately sets into motion a series of interconnected time lines, that in the end only affect the few characters we have come to see over and over again. When the credits role, I hope you find yourself snickering at the irony.

The picture is grainy and there is often some artifact here and there, but I feel it ads an element to the obscure premise of the film. The 5.1 sound is adequate for the realm this covers, but the English 2.0 was atrocious, I only lasted a few minutes. The special features almost outweigh the film and garner an additional star on their own. Plenty of production background and behind the scenes for those interested.

As I have read in other reviews, this is a film to watch more than once. I think if you do, it will allow you to get past the picking out of inconsistencies (hard not to do when there soooo many) and to just have fun. For those that disagree, I think that last line and scene sum up the premise. This will continue to be an overlooked little gem until the remake comes out (I think Cronenberg is doing it).",1238457600,5,1369,4.36078431372549

3587660,4,B001FOPOD8,"I felt a need to provide a counterbalance to the previous (2 star) review.  If you recognize the limited resources used in this movie (five actors...total!....and what had to be a VERY low budget) I think you can appreciate how much they accomplished in spite of their limits.  Very few movies involving time travel ever make sense when viewed en toto, but that doesn't stop them from being an enjoyable ride (Donny Darko, anyone?).  Reminiscent of the books ""The Man Who Folded Himself"" by David Gerrold or ""Croyd"" by Ian Wallace, the movie ""Timecrimes"" repeatedly folds back on itself until the viewer is lost in an Escheresque mobius strip of events.  But in this case think too hard and you kill the goose.  I enjoyed it very much...but don't ask me to explain it!",1231200000,2,768,4.701492537313433
3587661,2,B001FOPOD8,"""Timecrimes (Los Cronocrmenes)"" is likely to baffle even the most ardent sci-fi fans. It's a subtitled time travel story that keeps turning back on itself with a series of inane, nonsensical explanations and inexplicable behavior. It seems that writer/director Nacho Vigalondo was just trying to show how clever he can be, piling on a series of interconnecting events that are all the result of one man heedlessly venturing into uncharted territory. But cleverness can only go so far before it becomes hopelessly confused; by the end of the film, I had absolutely no idea what was going on, nor did I understand how any of it could have happened. Certain passages of dialogue are meant to explain it all, but what the characters say makes about as much sense as someone speaking in tongues. To be fair, there's a strong possibility that I missed something along the way. I admit that I'm not the most perceptive of viewers, especially when it comes to something as intentionally misleading as time travel.

In all honesty, I'm not sure I can describe the plot of this movie. Partly, it's because there's so much happening all at once, not all of which I caught on to. But mostly, it's because the story plays like an overactive mystery, with a back-to-back series of revelations. I can, however, describe the setup. Hctor (Karra Elejalde) and his wife, Clara (Candela Fernndez), have moved into a spacious home somewhere in the woods of Spain. One day, Hctor receives a mysterious phone call from someone that won't speak. When that person hangs up, Hctor redials the opposite line and gets only an automated message. Later on, as he lounges in his backyard, he looks through his binoculars and sees a young woman taking her shirt off in the middle of the woods. When Clara leaves to get dinner, he decides to go investigate. He finds not only a naked woman lying unconscious, but also a man whose face is wrapped in pink bandages. This man stabs Hctor in the arm with a pair of scissors. Hctor runs. He then seeks refuge in a strange laboratory, where a young scientist (Nacho Vigalondo) tells him to hide inside a metal vat filled with white liquid.

Thus begins a strange, unexplainable sequence of events that involves not one, but three Hctors occupying the same stretch of time, namely the ninety minutes before Hctor arrived at the laboratory. The technology behind the metal vat is left a little obscure, as is the reason for why the scientist seems to know everything about what's going on at all times (or in this case, at that one time). Isn't this impossible given the fact that he's completely outside of Hctor's time loop? Wouldn't he keep forgetting who Hctor is with every trip to the vat? Maybe this is just one of those extra plot details that somehow passed me by. The scientist attempts to explain this warped passage of time with a drawing on the back of a calendar, one that shows a line bending in a Z-shape; at each bend is an X marking each Hctor's position in time. It made sense up until the inclusion of a third Hctor.

The next thing I'm about to say will be annoyingly vague, so you've been warned. When Hctor 1 originally looks through his binoculars, what he sees is the direct result of Hctor 2. Here's what I don't understand: Why would Hector 2 even consider doing those things in the first place? The non-analytical answer is that there wouldn't be a story otherwise. Maybe not, but the fact that a story was formed around events that could have been avoided makes it all the more maddening. My basic reaction was that the entire thing would have been resolved if Hector 2 had stayed put not interfered with the timeline. Really, what's the harm in waiting for everything to smooth itself over? Is the theme of the story that you can't alter the past, no matter how much you want to? Is there even a theme, or is it just supposed to be a sci-fi yarn that shows how fun it is to mess with time?

At this point, I don't think I have any idea what I'm saying. This movie has that effect. ""Timecrimes"" is a film that only wants to spin in circles and drive the audience into an agonizing state of bewilderment. Few will have the time and the patience to make or tails of the story. Fewer still will believe there's something to make heads or tails of. If there is, in fact, a narrative logic to this movie, I feel ashamed for not having noticed it.

Boy, this movie frustrated me. As much as I replay certain scenes in my head, as much as I keep going over specific events that seemed significant, I'm unfortunately at a loss to explain what it wanted to achieve or if it achieved it. The idea is intriguing, no question. But when you're ultimately left with nothing but a list of questions--the most prominent being, ""What?""--I can't help but feel that the idea wasn't developed as well as it should have been. Vigalondo should have paid closer attention to films that got time travel right, like ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" which cleverly pitted Harry and Hermione against the past during the film's climactic final scenes. Even cinematic gambles like ""Next"" and ""Dj Vu"" managed to keep themselves focused, and they were box office failures. It would be interesting if I could go back in time and watch myself watching ""Timecrimes""; while it probably wouldn't help me to understand the film, at least I'd have fun seeing the perplexed look on my face.",1229040000,10,5401,4.621875

3587663,5,B001FOPOD8,"Terrific film. A modest budget and pedestrian locations only enhance the moviemaking here. Though it deals with expansive concepts of time paradox, and though much of it is filmed outside in a rural setting, it feels insular and claustrophobic, with curiosity becoming urgency as the viewer figures it out along with the main character. Please do not  watch the trailer. It gives huge clues that you should allow the film to gradually intrigue and surprise you with. I watched this film three times several years ago. I never saw this trailer until today and I can only think that it was made because of impatient and dull viewers who complain in their reviews. Distributors are throwing such viewers a bone with this trailer, so if more folks watch and recommend it, I am glad. But I do think it will mess with the experience somewhat.",1499472000,,836,4.76551724137931

3587665,4,B001FOPOD8,"A clever science fiction thriller, ""Timecrimes"" appears to be a typical slasher flick from the trailer. It's hardly that. This clever time travel story does a terrific job of summarizing the problem with goi g I to the past--no matter how much you try and change things, nature has a way of putting time back in joint.

H&eacute;ctor (Karra Elejalde) and his wife (Candela Fern&aacute;ndez) live in a house they are renovating out in the sticks. When H&eacute;ctor observes a woman taking off her top in the woods behind their house. When he ventures back there after his wife leaves to go shopping, he discovers the girl unconscious on the ground and a man who's head is bandaged attacks him with a pair of scissors. Escaping, H&eacute;ctor finds himself being stalked by the bandaged man and ends up going to a nearby home where a scientist (the director and writer of the film Nacho Vigalondo) hides him. From there things take a bizarre twist for the worst.

You may find yourself guessing some of the twists of the film pretty early on but there remain some unexpected twists that make the film a worthwhile flick to watch.

I watched this in demand from Amazon so can't comment about the DVD image quality (and, as I recall, there isn't a blu-ray release of this film in the U.S.) but the film remains entertaining enough that I would probably buy it. I don't regret renting it as it was an entertaining, clever diversion. The film for Amazon on demand features English subtitles (there is not a dubbed version in English as far as I know for those who don't like to watch subtitled films).

""Timecrimes"" director Nacho Vigalondo's feature debut is entertaining, suspenseful and well made. The film is presented in Spanish with English subtitles.",1494547200,,1752,4.772277227722772

Most of the story is just told through the events and the peoples body language.  Acting is plenty good enough for this film's story in my opinion.

The movie begins with Hector 1 who witnesses something really weird, goes to investigate, is attacked by some weirdo and so runs away. He then stumbles across a time machine.  How handy is that? I'll just go back in time and warn myself not to go investigate that really weird thing I saw. So he goes back in time where he instantly becomes Hector 2 -- Hector 1 is still in the past!

Then Hector 2 goes off to warn Hector 1.  With me so far? Not for long you won't.

Hector 2 behaves erratically at this point as he inexplicably commits the same bizarre acts he witnessed as Hector 1. Gee, I don't know, but didn't he want to try and stop Hector 1 from entering the time machine? Why commit the same bizarre acts? It's stupid.

If you can look beyond the train wreck of Hector 2's behavoir, this is a taut thriller with some unexpected twists and turns along the way. As it ries hard not to trip over any time travel paradoxes, it trips over the inexplicable actions by the main character.

3587836,5,B001FOPOD8,"Time travel movies, like autism disorders, can be laid out on a spectrum of intensity and complexity. There's the relatively high functioning Looper, where Bruce Willis early on brushes off any pedantic efforts to keep track of how future and past effect each other when A meets B who was or will be himself in the future/past.
Or then there's Primer. Don't get me started.
Somewhere in the middle there's the athletically trim Timecrimes. (don't ask me how ""athletically trim"" fits in with the autism spectrum simile. I've abandoned that long since) We have one mad scientist (a rather cowed one at that), one time traveler, and three trips backwards in time, each only a few hours into the past.
The main event is Hector, the traveler. He's conveniently given names for each of his incarnations: Hector 1, Hector 2 and Hector 3. Hector 1 is a naive, good samaritan, passionate family man type who goes into the woods to investigate what may be a rape. He is stabbed in the arm by a hideous demon wearing a long, dark coat and with his head wrapped loosely in bloody bandages. Moments later, Hector wraps gauze over the wound, unaware that in just a few moments (or about an hour ago) he will be wrapping the same gauze around his face to become the same nightmare figure who just attacked him.
Yes, Hector 2 is the nightmare, unwavering, never doubting the rightness of his cause, increasingly violent.
And then Hector 3, face bare, hideously and asymmetrically distorted with the left side all swollen and deeply cut, and his eyes barren, disillusioned, sad even as he commits cold blooded murder.

3587838,2,B001FOPOD8,"Based on some screwup at a laboratory working on time travel.  so this guy gets tricked into getting in the time machine (to hide because someone is chasing him) consisting of a big tub in lab with milk-like liquid. As the movie progresses it reveals a re-run or recurring cycle of himself in versions of himself within a short period of time (I think about 45 seconds). His re-lived versions of himself are trying to kill each other off so there will only be one of him and he can go back to normal life with wife. e.g. He sees a man with bandages in the woods across his yard. It turns out it is version x of himself, a short time previous. I think there were Hector 1, Hector 2, Hector 3 in the various time cycles.

Sorry, I was not going to watch the movie again to get a better understanding. It is something like that.

Oh, the rated R stuff -  to bait one of the Hectors to come to the woods to kill him, one of the Hectors forced girl to strip, She showed up riding by in a bicycle and when one of the Hector versions crashed she tried to help him.

FYI, the bandage around the head was a bit too much. When one of the Hectors crashed, it was a cut above the left eye, and somehow the movie script decided to wrap his whole head in gaze which I guess made it look spookier. anyway. good luck.",1412899200,,1301,4.086274509803921

I will try not to give anything away or as little as possible to try and explain myself. Hector gets hurt and uses bandaging he had from a previous injury to wrap his new injury and winds up looking like The Mummy. All I can tell you is this will play an important role throughout this story. Another silly action he takes involves his lack of communication with his wife and the Good Samaritan. He will use these same great skills with the guy who set his troubles in motion to begin with. The whole 3 different time versions of Hector was also an unintended laugh fest.
Its a comedy of errors that keeps repeating itself only it isn't meant to be a comedy or funny.
The story just didn't come across as being very well thought out and should have been listed as a comedy and not a horror movie. There is some violence although it is kept to a minimum as well as the almost nonexistent foul language. The movie does have a few female nude scenes and next to nothing in the blood and gore department.

the plot was well done. i look forward to an american version of this film (if it is done right). if there is one thing this movie made me think it is that we should never, ever, time travel. I gave the film 4 stars overall and think anyone on the fence about this should just give it a chance. like most dub movies you stop really noticing it once you get used to it anyways. the story is very well done. this could be rated pg13 for one brief scene of nudity. other than that its pretty take and relies on story to get its point across, like most good film does.",1393372800,,824,3.963855421686747

Worth watching for those who like sci-fi, time travel paradoxes, and the reality that everything that can and will happen already has happened and will happen the same way no matter what. The ending was a little soft, and there were some predictable parts, but all the questions raised during the movie are actually answered, which is unusual. Every viewpoint is shown, and except for the rather soft ending it is all wrapped up pretty neatly.

I didn't appreciate the juvenile horror movie tropes, as I am not a fan of that genre.  Nobody could handle running without falling over, crouching ridiculously and hiding from ultra-slow-motion pursuit even though nothing is stopping them from escaping, or collapsing after a few yards from exhaustion.  Night falls abruptly in the middle of a scene or two.  A house being remodeled is covered with spoopy hanging plastic sheeting.  If you see anyone naked, they're doomed.

The science fiction concept itself was covered so much better by The Butterfly Effect, but unlike that movie, the events being rectified in this one were completely arbitrary.  They also had no emotional resonance.  Why is this character compelled to make the same mistakes over and over, much less these mistakes?  Who knows?  Who cares?  His enigmatic bumbling isn't even consistent, which makes watching him do stupid things badly even more painful - I suppose I can understand that some people are just bad at everything and have terrible judgment, but then this formerly stumbling weenie successfully bullies some dude and a woman who can probably beat him arm wrestling into submitting to his will.  Really?  This broken-down paunchmeister can intimidate athletic young people into doing whatever he says using ordinary household implements even after sustaining serious injuries?  He held scissors on someone like they were a gun from three yards away, and the person cowered!  Yeah right!  All they had to do was punch him in something bleeding or swollen and run, and he was a target-rich tapestry of discoloration.  I feel like this script was written by a total wuss and I can't relate.  If you can, that's bad, and you should feel bad.

Lastly, some movies bother to incorporate symbolic motifs.  A table, scissors, a walkie-talkie, a tire iron - these objects should have been more than just objects, they should have told us something about the inner life of the characters and what was happening to them.  Instead, I thought that the recurring presence of trails of trash strewn about everywhere said it all.",1391212800,,2303,4.896640826873385

3587930,1,B001FOPOD8,"You have probably noticed how polarized the reviews are.  So...how to know if you might like it or not?
 I was swayed by the lengthy and well written positive reviews, and it seemed the negative reviewers cared not to prove their points.  The following may explain why:  The positive reviewers enjoy solving a deep problem, and want others to know that they were smart enough to solve it.  The negative reviewers mentioned the characters did not behave believably,  the characters were not likeable, and the plot was illogical.
So...how to know what type of person you may be?
The positive reviewers may be the type that  will argue their point -  it is very important to them that they are right and smart, and they may argue at length to the contrary (they may need to ask their spouse what type they are).  The positive reviewer may forgive anything else in a movie, as long as it holds the promise of a difficult problem they can solve.
The negative reviewer may be less likely to argue their point, and it is not especially important to them that others think them right or smart - if challenged they may say, ""believe what you want.""  The negative reviewer may quickly reject a movie which has either an illogical plot,  unbelievable characters, or unlikeable characters.
If you know yourself, and can determine your type, maybe you can determine whether you will like Timecrimes or not.

3587938,5,B001FOPOD8,"I stumbled across this film while looking for something to pass the time (no pun intended), and am so thankful that I did. Here is a film that resonates what a film about time travel should contain.
The cast was completely unknown to me, which in my case is too bad for me. I'd enjoy seeing them in other films.
But in this case the cast of four characters are stand alone. Ordinary people being caught up in a situation that at first glance they have no control over, but as the film develops they start to put two and two together to figure out the paradox that is Time Travel.
The lead is very convincing as an average Joe caught up in a situation that he is so unfamiliar with, but is smart enough to begin to figure things out. His wife loves him and is willing to listen to him even though she is really unsure what is happening.
The lab worker offers enough explanation to carry even the least savvy audience member into a simple understanding of Time Travel and the paradoxes that might transpire if tampered with.
The young woman is both a real beauty and shows the lead enough support to make her part an important aspect of the film.
That the movie was dubbed into English was not a problem to me. I thought it was done very well and was not in the least distracted.
I recommend this film to anyone that would like a different take on Time Travel and would consider it time well spent. I will watch this film again in a week or two if for nothing else but to revisit these wonderful characters.",1383004800,,1505,4.28421052631579

3587944,3,B001FOPOD8,"The story of Nacho Vigalondo's cult thriller ""Timecrimes"" (""Los cronocrmenes"") begins with an ordinary middle-aged man Hctor (Karra Elejalde) living with his loving wife Clara (Candela Fernndez). In the woods near his house Hctor is attacked and chased by a mysterious person whose face is wrapped in a scarlet-colored bandage. Hctor takes refuge in a nearby building, where a scientist (Nacho Vigalondo) helps him out by using a time machine.

""Timecrimes"" is surprisingly accessible, compared with some similar-themed films like ""Primer"" (2004), but there is always something mechanical about Nacho Vigalondo's cult time-travel thriller. You may puzzle over who initiates what, trying to understand the interplay of cause and effect, but in terms of human motives and psychology the film does not convince.

Probably that is the point of ""Timecrimes,"" where everything is rationally explained at the cost of common sense logic. The film is in a way as an antithesis to such films as ""Frequency"" and the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, in which motives of characters we root for play more important roles than logically explaining away potential plot holes.

3587950,4,B001FOPOD8,"Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental and as such I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of this individual disc.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

In this enjoyable, twisting thriller, Hector, a middle-aged husband is lured out of his humdrum world when he catches a glimpse through his binoculars of a pretty young woman undressing in the woods behind his house.  Upon investigating, he finds himself the quarry of a mysterious, bandaged man, one who seems intent on killing him.  Thinking he has found a refuge, Hector runs to nearby compound, where he finds an ally who offers him a place to hide.  But his hiding place is only the beginning of Hector's problems, and the assailant he's been running from turns out to be more familiar than he would ever have guessed.

It's no secret that this film deals with time travel - all the blurbs give it away, as well as the title.  Too bad - I think someone coming at this film blindly would find its twists and turns especially surprising and enjoyable, though I thought the film was still very entertaining.  This is a film which depends upon the viewpoint of the main character in order to conceal its resolution - as the film advances, Hector (who is caught in a sort of time loop) sees more and more of the whole picture, as does the audience.  This way, inexplicable events are slowly put into context and tied together.  As another reviewer pointed out, one of the first films that came to my mind when watching this one was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memento/dp/B00003CXZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memento</a>&nbsp;- like that film, all the pieces come together slowly, feeding the audience little bits of information at a time, and trusting their patience will last until the end of the film.  I should make clear - it isn't _like_ MEMENTO in any other way than a similarity in the way it dribbles information to the audience.  Nor is it quite as relentless as the other film, though still tense.

I had seen the DVD cover for this film for quite a while before I finally decided to take a chance on it.  To me, I think it looks like a very generic slasher type film, or worse, a home invasion sort.  Generally, I'm not interested in either genre, so it was some time before I actually read the synopsis attached to the film.  Whatever impression the cover makes on you, this is a thriller rather than a horror film.  As such there is very little blood and guts.  Instead, the film relies on style and method to keep the tension going and to keep the audience interest up.

This is another very entertaining Spanish film, on the order of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intacto/dp/B00008WJBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intacto</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nameless/dp/B004SUDQ04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nameless</a>, although probably not quite as good as those two.  But the more I see of the output from there, the more I like their general style.  I don't know if I can put my finger on what it is exactly that is the difference between Spanish and American films, but one thing I notice is that in American films, it is almost as if they break the fourth wall with their tendency to make movies that are simply vehicles for the celebrity actors appearing in them.  That's an over-simplification and a generization, I know, but at least with these Spanish films, I can't recognize whether the actors have such star value that they can't be killed off right away.  It leaves me guessing.

I also think these films are very un-condescending toward the viewer, treating us as if we are patient, intelligent viewers able to keep a storyline straight without having to resort to ham-fisted expository devices to clue us in.  With those thoughts, I was very surprised to notice the amount of reviewers who intensely disliked this film.  Well, as always, your mileage may vary, but even if one felt the story elements left something to be desired, this is still a well put together film.  In fact, I think it's an excellent popcorn flick and easily give it four stars.",1339027200,,4245,5.061781609195402

3587958,4,B001FOPOD8,"Given its misleading title and its time travel genre, ""Timecrimes"" (2008)  may attract viewers expecting  something along the lines of  ""Time After Time"" (1979),  in which Malcolm McDowell played H.G.Wells and used Wells' time machine to pursue Jack the Ripper.  And given the ""Invisible Man"" (1933) inspired poster art you might expect to find Claude Rains playing a Wells' character, or maybe John Hurt playing the ""Elephant Man"" (1980).

If you seek a Wells' connection you better look elsewhere, but ""Elephant Man"" fans will find that actor Karra Elejalde (playing Hector - the main character) puts John Merrick to shame in the homely department.  That poor guy is so ugly that his face actually looks better sporting the assortment of bumps, cuts, and bruises he receives during the course of the film.

""Timecrimes"" is a solid time travel movie, although minimalist enough to be within reach of an ambitious college film class.  The script and minimalist style are are the film's strengths.  My advice would be to just take it for what it is and suppress any temptation to question the characters' motivation and behavior.  As there is no attempt at characterization such questioning is a waste of time.  The acting and the acting for the camera direction are so uniformly poor that most will be grateful that the characterization is so superficial, thereby saving viewers from a lot of unnecessary torture.

And don't get hung up on how the cycle started, it starts without cause at the point a time machine becomes operational.  Just think of it as a literary device, something that simply occurs once it becomes possible for something like it to occur.

Time travel in the movies is typically about paradox.  If the time traveler interacts with anything outside his normal time it will cause rippling changes in events.  ""Timecrimes"" wants you to think that this is what the story is about but that is all misdirection.  This story is more like Vonnegut's Tralfamadore; where an event happens a certain way, has always happened a certain way, and always will happen a certain way. All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist.  The entertainment comes from watching the pieces come together from three distinct points of view, as the main character experiences the same time sequence several times but from different POV's.  If you like the concept, then track down the film ""Triangle"" (2009), which looks at the same idea in a more philosophical fashion.  If you want an even bigger mental challenge from the genre track down ""Primer"" (2004).  And if you want a really original philosophical exercise in reality vs imagination try ""The Life Before Her Eyes"" (2007).

The DVD allows you to choose between English subtitles or dubbed English. There has been a lot of complaining about the dubbed version but the dubbing is as good as most and better than some; but it is dubbing.

3587966,3,B001FOPOD8,"Time Crimes is based on a pretty good idea. Often time travel stories can end up like a pretzel, but this film manages to contain the situation nicely.

However, I cant help myself.. I have a few suggestions. Maybe something the American remake can address.

No. 1
The protagonist makes illogical decisions throughout the film.
-""Take off your pants... This will work cause I am (I mean he is) a pervert"".
-Lets go in the bushes and look for a naked chick without anything but binoculaurs.
-OMG Where is he?!?! he just stabbed me a second ago... let me just turn around and look thru my superfantastic b-i-n-o-c-u-laars!!!.
-Lets walk really slow up the xmas lit hill when the bad guy is ""!!COMING!!!""
-Yes he's right.. Ill get in the big chamber machine, he won't look for me in there
-Oh crap he just saw me thru the window.. I definitely better hide in the chamber machine now.

No. 2
I know this is pointless in the same vain as... ""what happened before the big bang""
but how did he end up in a time machine the FIRST time? What created this event?

No. 3
The female characters are ridiculous.
-the naked chick is just ridiculously nice.
""Oh hello Slipknot stranger with bandage wrapped around head.. are u ok?""
""Lets go in the bushes like u ask mr Slipknot sir""
""Here have a pair of scissors Mr. I don't know who the f%%% you are""
""Oh I just kicked the fat dude in the face...what should I do now.. I have a great a$$... but I don't think Ill be able to outrun him... hmmm I know.. Ill just hide behind the bushes ---- ah he got me""
""I just woke up naked and now there is another fat dude... what should I do..I know Ill help him too... I'm superwoman.. Cmon mr fat dude... lets get you to safety.. Ill make soup... and make out with you... huh in ur dreams pervert""

-Wife
""whats going on .. someone just screamed on the roof - oh thanks honey Ill just park my a$$ on this bench like you tell me to""

I know Im being picky but it gets like that after a while. Its just a series of events which are hard to comprehend. Someone once told me that sometimes the most absurd truth is the real truth ... and maybe in reality we can do absurd things.. like sometimes go out into the bushes to look for a naked chick... but in cinema, when we are trying really hard to believe in the fiction... too many absurd situations (no matter how small) just become distracting.

No... (was it 4)
As with other time beinding movies... one of the biggest traps is to fall into a repetitive environment. Im not saying Time Crimes gets bad like Bill Murray's masterpiece ""GroundHog day""... but there is a point in the movie where one knows what the premise of the plot is.. and where its going... because its already happened. It manages to twist and turn a fair bit which I think saves it from narrowly missing that catastrophe but there is still that sense. You get this exposition about what is happening and you then understand why things happened and then you spend the next 15 minutes seeing what you already realised happened... happen...

Ok I give up

Stuff like this will never make a lick of sense. And the fact that Hector's behaviour is often inexplicable adds to the absurdity. But none of this matters because Vigalondo has crafted a nicely twisting puzzle that is absorbing from start to finish. In fact Hector's bizarre actions, as his life unravels around him, add to the gothic undertones. It's all nicely understated, in the way that only European cinema can be, and the performances from the small, unknown cast are uniformly good. This is low budget movie-making at its best.

3587969,1,B001FOPOD8,"This movie was bad. It was not the acting, which was fine. The directing was so- so. I have no problem with english dubs (which is how I watched it. Why would anyone want to have to keep their eyes glued to the bottom of the screen reading subtitles for  2 hours, missing elements of the MOVIE happening above the subtitles, or missing a key dialogue if you have to sneeze or turn your head for some reason?)

No, my problem is with the main element that will make or break a movie: the story.

The point of most main character's journey is to STOP bad things from happening. That seemed to be the goal of the hero here. Instead the ""hero"" goes back in time to complete a circle of bad events, FOR NO GOOD REASON, other than having the director ""show off"" and impress us with how he explains why the weird or bad things happened earlier in the movie. But if you think about it, it wasn't impressive at all:

It's like seeing the main character, Hector, trip over a pink rock on the side of the road and injure his knee at the beginning of the movie, then saying ""Let's go back in time to prevent this from happening, and find out how this rock got there and why?"" The answer is something like: ""well because a presumably good main character painted a rock pink and put it there."" without answering the question why. ""Why? because it's SUPPOSED to be there."" Yes, but wasn't the character supposed to STOP the accident from happening in the first place?

There is no reason why things have to turn out they way they do  other than ""this event must happen so that in falls in line with the timeline."" Thus, the director forces these weird events to happen. But there is still no logical explanation as to why they MUST happen.

On top of that, the main character makes bad decisions at every turn, which disconnects him from the audience. The peripheral characters (mostly women) do not act like independent thinking humans, but automatons who follow the directions of the main character (i.e. the plot) even though what he is asking them to do doesn't make a lick of sense and they have no reason to follow his orders. As a matter of fact, the lead is seems like a selfish twerp and is unlikable.

Back to the bad direction in this movie: At the beginning, a character is stabbed in the arm by an unknown assailant, then turns and runs without looking at his attacker (and we, the audience don't see the ""mysterious assailant"") That doesn't make sense, other than the director doesn't want us to see this mysterious figure just yet, to keep us in suspense. But it doesn't matter because soon after, we see that the killer had bandages on his face that whole time and we couldn't see what he looked like anyway.

The director needs to take a dip in this movie's ""hot tube time machine"" so he can go back and undo this mess.",1274572800,5,2821,4.399232245681382

I love the idea here, but the direction, acting and general quality are barely b-movie. The lighting and set-ups are pure low budget and I had trouble getting past that and into the concept.

Make sure to watch this in Spanish; as bad as the subtitles are, they are masterful next to some of the worst English dubbing I've ever heard.

All in all, we were very bored very quickly; this movie has some scenes that are just sheer nothingness posing as suspense, and once you've figured out the main idea, it's all pretty obvious. I've seen dozens of time travel movies and this is easily one of the worst-made.

No matter how good your premise is, if the filmmaking is weak the film itself is going to be subpar. Timecrimes is the perfect example of that.",1271116800,5,764,4.474820143884892

It's not a bad movie, but it's not what I expected, as the title makes it seem like crimes take place, but it's not really the case. I won't spoil the plot for you, but it's something you will have to see to understand that.

Take note as well that this is a Spanish movie, and not in English. Tho some reviewers have complained the video-on-demand version is dubbed into English, which is the version I have not seen. Quite frankly the movie does not hold a candle to movies like Back To The Future, or even Time Cop. But it's not that kind of movie tho, it's not really a comedy, and not a sci-fi adventure either... it's kind of more a low budget, suspense, thriller, tho even that is making it sound further away then what it really is.

3587973,5,B001FOPOD8,"Spain, The Present: Whilst reclining in the garden of his weekend home in the country, Hector (Karra Elejalde) notices what appears to be a naked girl in a nearby forest glade. Leaving the safety of his lawn-chair to investigate, Hector is menaced by a sinister pink bandage-swathed figure who  wounds him with a pair of scissors. He seeks desperate shelter in a nearby building which he discovers houses a laboratory overseen by a single attendant (Director, Nacho Vigalondo) who advises him to hide from his pursuer in a strange tank. When he escapes moments later, Hector discovers that he has been catapulted back through time by several hours...

""Time Crimes"" may just be the most devastatingly effective and devilishly clever time travel film yet made; and believe me, being a thirty year veteran of time travel movies, this is not an accolade that I pay it lightly.

Director Nacho Vigalondo takes a cast of roughly four characters, around three locations, a complete absence of special effects and manages to work a feat of filmic alchemy from these meager ingredients which is as easily impressive as the vaguely suggested time travel technology at the heart of the film.

(And for all of you time travel movie junkies who think you already have this one worked out because you've already guessed who, inevitably, the pink-bandaged figure must be, let me assure you that you haven't. The twists and turns that this story takes are genuinely unpredictable and fiendishly clever.)

To go into the plot of this movie any further would be to deny you the pleasures of one of my favourite filmic rollercoaster rides of recent years. Suffice it to say that Karra Elejalde is perfectly cast as paunchy, balding everyman, Hector - a character who finds himself caught up in the temporal equivalent of a grand-master's chess match and who undergoes a profound redefinition of values and consciousness throughout the film.

Apparently, a Hollywood remake of this - currently tentatively helmed by Steven Zaillian -  is already on the cards. Forget about it and rent or buy the original instead. No handsome Hollywood leads indulging clichd in histrionics or pointless CGI effects are necessary and will only serve to dilute the genius of Vigalondo's original.",1265760000,2,2259,5.024064171122995

When his wife goes on an errand to town, Hector goes looking for the alluring mystery woman. He ends up involved in an absurd scenario in which he keeps stumbling and falling, gets stabbed with a pair of scissors by a strange man with very soiled bandages wrapped mummy-like around his head, and ends up submerged in a cheesy time machine that looks like a combo jacuzzi/tanning capsule. The film ""explains"" how all of this ties in to Hector's attempt to undo changes that took place while he was in the cheesy capsule. Also, while in this machine, Hector gets ""triplicated."" That is, there are three Hectors stumbling and bumbling around. As if one is not enough.

Everything about this production came off as very amateurish to me.

I don't want to spoil it by telling more, but how can one spoil spoiled meat? It's almost one of those ""it's so bad that it's good"" films. But, alas, it does not even attain that status.",1248998400,7,1133,4.6318407960199
3587980,4,B001FOPOD8,"Hector has a lovely wife and a beautiful new home, a seemingly idyllic life - so why does he have difficulty sleeping, why is he so easily distracted, why is he so interested in spying on the neighbors, and why does he jump and drop the phone when his wife walks in on an apparent prank call?  A number of reviewers have mentioned the time-travel plot of this film, but what I think makes it fascinating is the subtext.  Here's a middle-aged man, who seems to like to think of himself as in charge, the ""man of the house,"" but his wife is an independent woman, sexually self-assured, and unwilling to be bossed around.  His voyeuristic fascination with a beautiful woman in a nearby woods seems to go beyond a merely casual intrigue, but speaks to his deep seated, but infantile, psychological need to establish his own dominance in his relationships with women.  While Hector initially seems to be a victim in an elaborate conspiracy, we come to wonder who precisely is served by what goes on.  It turns out that the entire elaborate time travel scheme, which is very cleverly executed, serves precisely to resolve for Hector the psychological issue that the opening scenes very carefully and subtly lay out.  The film cries out for a Freudian or neo-feminist reading (note how the girl stands in as a surrogate for his wife, a younger, more passive version who he can treat as a sex object - to be looked at and controlled - rather than a more threatening sexualized subject) - check this one out after reading Laura Mulvey's seminal essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visual-and-Other-Pleasures/dp/1403992460/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visual and Other Pleasures</a>.  What makes this even better is that you don't need to think about any of that to enjoy this film, that works very well on a number of different levels and rewards multiple viewings.  It was one of my favorite foreign films at the Sundance Film Festival when it played there in 2008, but I liked it even more when I saw it again in local theaters, and again on DVD.",1247184000,8,2124,4.9633802816901404
3587981,1,B001FOPOD8,"A huge heads up, for those who are considering purchasing the video via on demand. This is the dubbed into English version...not subtitled. I stopped the movie after five minutes in. Hugely disappointed by the non-disclosure.",1245110400,157,225,5.277777777777778
3587982,4,B001FOPOD8,"TimeCrimes is actually quite enjoyable for a low budge movie. I know, the moment I see the keyword `low budget' I'm repulsed and possibilities of time wasted, but in all honesty you'll walk away shaking your head and wondering about this one.

It'll be a bit difficult to explain the premise as it is difficult to explain time travel paradoxes, movies like Donnie Darko or Einstein's Relativity Theory.
But I'll try.

The movie examines a day in the life of Hector, a forty-something year-old man who seems quite burnt out by life and in serious need of shaving. Hector and his wife seem to enjoy nature as we find them at their summer home (my interpretation) in the country side. Hector is a bit of a rascal as we see him straying away from house work and instead wasting time on lounging on a chair and snooping around with a pair of binoculars.

And here is where the movie picks up. Hector sees a naked woman in the not too distant forest and that image peaks his interest. While his wife takes off to a nearby store, Hector is off to the woods exploring his own horniness. When he finally finds the woman propped up completely nude against a rock, Hector is afraid to approach. Once near her, her attempts to touch her.

Then a strange man with a bandaged head and a trench coat pops up out of nowhere and stabs Hector with a pair of scissors. Hector manages to escape and wanders into a physics lab (why is there a lab in the middle of the forest is another question) where a scientist transports Hector back in time.

This is where I'll let the viewers judge the movie for themselves as the concept of a double or a triple Hector wandering through the same episode may take me hours to narrate.

Needless to say, the end of the movie ties quite nicely. And while the Hector grows on us, we are left with the realization that he is actually not a nice man at all. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie.

Movies in similar fashion:

) Primer
) Donnie Darko
) The Butterfly Effect",1244246400,3,1994,4.370270270270271
3587983,5,B001FOPOD8,"Hector comes home to his posh suburban sanctuary. His wife greets him. They work on various projects around the house and yard. His wife decides to go to the store, while Hector does a little ""bird-watching"" with binoculars. When he sets off to investigate what he sees, he has no idea how complicated his life is about to become.

Los cronocrmenes (Timecrimes) is a cleverly written and directed, expertly acted Spanish film about time travel. Not time travel as it is usually imagined and romanticized, but as a new product that accidentally falls into the hands of people like you and me. This movie is so crisp and so witty, I'm convinced watching it makes people smarter. So watch it as many times as you can.",1243296000,5,714,4.666666666666667
3587984,3,B001FOPOD8,"TimeCrimes

Interesting but bizarre film on time paradox, a Spanish film with English subtitles.

Despite this, it is not hard to follow.

We start off with a 1st person view of a total klutz; a guy who leaves his car trunk open and stuff falls out, etc.

Somehow or other, he ends up on his bedroom (the first person view stops for some reason, and the audience again has a third person view.  Huh?)  The phone rings.  Heavy breathing.  Nothing.

He finds this weird, then goes outside to relax, and raises his binoculars and sees a girl taking off her T-shirt.  (Yes, full frontal, one star).

His wife goes to the store and he then decides to investigate.  He finds an unconscious or dead nude woman.  A guy with bandages sneaks up on him and stabs him and he runs away.

After some time, he stumbles into a lab with lots of radiation warning signs.  A guy there coaxes him into a vat.  This vat and machine turn out to be a time machine, run by a geek on the weekends who wanted to see what would happen.

The guy on the phone was actually Hector number 2, who was rear-ended by Hector number 3 in order to prevent the death of Hector number 1's wife.  But if that happens, then Hector 1, well.... you get the idea.  Time paradox.

The film starts off very slow but then picks up the pace and gives a rather roundabout premise.  What is important to a man?  Can he change his destiny or is the fact that he had to make sure destiny happened as the way it should happen cause a disaster?

The ending is a bit unsatisfying but at least (spoiler) Hector is himself again, though a bit cut up and bruised by the experience.

You really have to see this several times to really get the pacing and the suspense of this thinking man's thriller.

Recommended if you're a student of foreign films and want a different take on the old Time Travel paradox story.

Amazon says there's supposed to be an English version remake.  Oh no!

3587985,1,B001FOPOD8,"The most thrilling part of this very low budget, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited and poor screen writing is the very cool bandage wrapping on the poor guy's head. That is the only intellectually stimulating and thrilling part to the entire movie. The time scenarios are non-sensical and illogical at best and would fail any high school level understanding of time-space physics. Best illustrated by no explanation as to why climbing into a vat of milk takes you a few hours into the past. On top of that we have a lone individual (no security) playing around on the weekend with, would probably be the only time travel device on Earth, that so happens to be in a suburban neighborhood with no security and with energy demands that would drain a city. It turns out to be his personal play toy which he operates with a Nintendo game pad. There is meant to be paradox within the storyline but in this case it's a rationalization for confusion i.e. a movie with no thoughtfulness or direction.",1242432000,5,1002,4.698863636363637
3587986,2,B001FOPOD8,"I just got done watching this and have to say that I am left unimpressed and actually quite dissapointed. The dvd itself if ok, with some extras. But as for the film itself, I would not recommend it to anyone else. I was expecting something similar to Primer, at least in theory.

The whole 'bandaged man' thing and the time travel aspect were the most frustrating and really made the movie painful to watch after halfway through. If this is what time travel is like, then don't sign me up, as its a bummer!",1242172800,3,507,4.3936170212765955
3587987,5,B001FOPOD8,"I agree with the previous postings here, so I too will not re-hash the plot.  While watching it the first time, I unfortunately had to turn it off in the middle, which only served to confuse me because I was trying to piece everything together.  It definitely had me wondering WHY?  I was able to watch the rest, but was still confused.  So I watched the alternate cut (exclusively to Blockbuster I believe) that shows the story in true chronological order, as opposed to Hector's point of view.  While this cut (a mere 68 minutes long and only in Spanish with subtitles) would be even more confusing had I seen it first, it was definitely helpful in understanding the theatrical cut; not only in regards to Hector, but also the scientist (as a previous reviewer mentioned; the scientist seems to know what's going on completely.)  Both cuts are expertly edited and the pacing is wonderful.  If you get the opportunity, try to see the alternate cut; you won't regret it.",1240185600,7,970,4.670588235294118
3587988,5,B001FOPOD8,"I would have never heard about Timecrimes if not for seeing it's trailer on the Let the Right One In DVD (another foreign film worth your time). Both are going to be remade here in the US, but I doubt they will come close to the originals. This is hands down one of the best time travel movies I have ever seen. You can tell that the budget wasn't much and the film only has a total of four cast members, but with good writing and acting you don't need million dollar SFX shots. There were many moments that caught me by surprise and the farther along the movie goes the more it draws you in. I'm not sure I got everything figured out after watching it the first time, but that's what makes these kind of films so great. You can tell the writer and director, Nacho Vigalondo, put a lot of time and effort in crafting such a masterful work of Sci-Fi/Suspense. Make sure you watch this film with subtitles and not dubbed because it makes a huge difference in tone. Take it from me, this is a must see. Add it to your rental queue and prepare to have 90 minutes of thought and wonder.",1239408000,64,1081,4.201923076923077
3587989,3,B001FOPOD8,"I rented this with high expectations and was at least a bit befuddled when it was over. I think I know what happened but it will take repeated viewings before I'm certain.

Let me say up front that I love these kinds of movies. I like having to wrap my head around plots. It makes the viewing all the more interesting. A couple of my favorites are ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Deja Vu."" The difference between those and ""Timecrimes"" is that they are ""2 Loop"" storylines, whereas Timecrimes"" is a ""3 loop"" which really makes your head spin.

I won't recap the plot as that has been done here a few times. I will say that I was intrigued for much of the viewing. The viewer is given various clues as to what's going on and the clues are revisited in a way as to reveal things that have happened or will happen. It's when we hit the 3rd loop that I found myself almost entirely lost. Again, I think I know what happened, but as I was not entirely certain I felt frustrated at the end.

On the good side this is a plot driven movie whereby even the relatively low budget doesn't hurt things. The viewer is (or should be) so wrapped up in the plot as to not be distracred. It's shot and edited well enough where you don't notice the bones. Also, things move at a brisk pace. I never found myself looking at my watch.

On the bad side, these kinds of movies have inherent difficulties in the plotting. Some of these difficulties scream in this one. Seems to me the main character could have made a key choice early on to deal with the circumstance and chose not to. Of course it would have made for a lousy movie but there you have it.

All in all this is well worth watching. Very few movies display this kind of inventiveness and that alone qualifies it as a should see. As for the twists and turns in the plot, I know it would take me at least one more viewing to see if the pieces of the puzzle fit. So, as of now, it gets 3 stars. That might change in the future.",1239148800,6,1951,4.164456233421751
3587990,4,B001FOPOD8,"Although it is oddly classified under the horror genre, Timecrimes is definitely more fitting under the sci-fi/thriller categories, as this Spanish treat certainly delivers more on those merits than anything truly horrific.  Karra Elejalde stars as Hector, a man whose tranquil life takes a different turn when he spots a naked woman (Barbara Goenaga).  After he goes to investigate, he is stabbed by a man with a bandaged head, and that's only the beginning of Hector's troubles.  His search for refuge leads him to a close-by science center and its technician (writer/director Nacho Vigalondo), and is only followed by a whole series of time-bending consequences.  Yes, Timecrimes is one of those films that paying careful attention to helps, and while some of the developments may seem a bit predictable, the film manages to rack up the suspense factor, while also maintaining an intelligent and thought-provoking story.  The minimal budget is meaningless, as Vigalondo manages to keep you enthralled throughout.  With an American-ized remake on the way (of course), here's hoping that it manages to do Timecrimes the justice it deserves.",1238716800,23,1141,5.311111111111111
