Buy it and love it! Has a great commentary by Director Jim Stramel and star George Archer.

I've seen this about 10 times and it just gets better.

Treat yourself to this gem now - you've already waited too long!!!

Grab it and kick back with a few beers and a few friends.

You will not be disappointed!!!",1356220800,,344,4.151515151515151
