8158300,4,B000KMPNC8,I like the movie.  The format is hard to figure out.  This particular DVD is hard to get back to a certain segment to watch.,1370822400,,124,3.92
8158301,5,B000KMPNC8,"My kids enjoyed this movie in the 1970's and 1980's and now their kids are watching the same movie.  It seems a little dated but the story is timeless.  From the ages of 2 and up, this movie is enjoyable for all.",1348012800,,212,4.023809523809524
8158302,5,B000KMPNC8,"This comment is NOT specifically about this film. It's a warning with regard to the word 'PEGASUS'. AVOID and TOTALLY any dvd's with this word on the information slip or disc, as all their film to dvd transfers are RUBBISH/C***! This is noted already by several of the comments about this specific dvd.",1339545600,,302,4.716981132075472
8158303,5,B000KMPNC8,"I loved this movie after renting it from the library for my 4 and 5 year olds to see. It really familiarized them with the different sounds of instruments. Understandably it is not up to ""today's standards"" of high resolution, as it was made long ago. My only criticism is that Tubby is called ""fat"" twice and an ""idiot"" once by a mean ringmaster, I think that wasn't necessary. The movie story line is that a tuba wants his own melody, as melodies aren't normally written for tubas. He goes on a search to ""find himself"" and what he is good at, ends up letting it get to his head when he does succeed. Eventually he fails, and then continues his journey to find his melody and happiness in being himself. It is well presented, the songs are great. We all loved it!",1303689600,,765,4.356643356643357
8158304,3,B000KMPNC8,"I have used the VHS tape of ""Tubby the Tuba"" for many years with my first grade music classes during our study of pitch- high sounds and low sounds (piccolo and tuba). Our school tends to go now with DVDs, so am able to show it via my classroom SMARTboard (tm)...but the quality of the rendition is very poor, out of focus at times, and my worst criticism of the DVD format is that it is all recorded on one track. My classes are not long enough to show it in one sitting, nor would I want to, but with this format it requires me to run the DVD until we get to where we left off the previous week, and then start up again....won't work when I have different grade levels back to back as I do...That aside, the movie is the same and the storyline is quite suitable for children of this age group.",1295395200,5,795,4.102564102564102
8158305,3,B000KMPNC8,"Received this item in very quick time well before estimated time of arrival and in time for Christmas which was great as it was for a present.  I was a bit disappointed in the product as it was not as I remembered the original CD by Paul Kidd, however, I am sure that my granddaughter will like it when she is old enough to view it which will not be for another 12 months.  As I had no way of previewing the DVD before purchase I am happy that the product was true to its description.  I would like to thank Amazon and the person who actually sold me this DVD for the prompt delivery and accuracy of product description.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tubby-the-Tuba/dp/B000KMPNC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tubby the Tuba</a>",1293494400,,764,5.096
8158306,5,B000KMPNC8,"I purchased this DVD as a fun gift for my 30 year old son, who absolutely loved this movie when he was a small boy.  It was exactly as we both remembered it and it was so much fun to see again.  We also had his son (9) who is thinking about joining either orchestra or a band and he also liked it; we had to look at it again 2 weeks later!
Thank you - we received it in excellant shape and in very good time.",1284854400,,408,3.67816091954023
8158307,5,B000KMPNC8,"Don't be fooled by other versions of this movie. This is the long,full length version.(orange background w/ houses)
This movie is the bomb! After my child watched this,I was shocked to hear from them that they wanted to be a musician. Before this inspiring film,there was only video games,which are now in the closet.
Voices by the great performers Dick Van Dyke and Pearl Bailey make this a must have. The music is great,better than the old LP recording predating the film.
This movie opens the imagination to what a person can accomplish musically and in life.
Get it while you can,it's a classic,and it's out of production.",1222646400,5,626,4.805555555555555
8158308,3,B000KMPNC8,My 2 year old really likes it. There's nothing like old-time cartoon movies; the innocence and the life lessons. I have heard better renditions and recordings of the music - but it's very nice. I wish the tuba depicted were bigger and more tuba-like. So does my kid - Tubby doesn't look very tuba to him. Also wish there were more tuba solos.,1213315200,,342,4.444444444444445
8158309,1,B000KMPNC8,"The quality of the film was so poor that it was difficult to watch. I fondly remember as a child listening to the record version of Tubby,but  the cartoon was a sad imitation. I should have requested a refund!",1213142400,,209,4.358974358974359
