8179690,5,B000NO2D30,"I thought that i was advanced enough just to buy level 3, but maybe you might still need level 2, it is difficult. On the main menu, you can choose the full workout, segments, or combinations. The segments are:
1. Waking Energy Standing (24 min) yang/yin
2. The 5 Tibetans (11 min) hot=yang
3. Pilates (35 min) hot= yang
4. Yoga (52 min) hot= yang
5. Jazz (20 min) hot= yang
6. Cardio Sculpt (27 min) hot=yang  *3 pound weights needed
7. Ballet (17 min) hot=yang
8. Yin Yoga and Meditation (28 min) yin=cool
I found that having different segments and combinations made the dvd especially interesting, and i liked it. I highly recommend it for everyone interested in not only pilates, but everything else Jennifer Kries has to offer. I am definitely a fan of hers!",1405900800,3,763,4.569343065693431

8179692,5,B000NO2D30,"""JENNIFER is a master instructor and highly knowledgeable. She is a leader in the Pilates/Dance/Yoga world. Level 3 is part of a 4 part series and I thoroughly enjoyed this innovative and rejuvenating experience. Level 3 may have the same segments, but they have progressed to challenge your skill level. As usual, it is packed with options that you will surely want to do EVERYTHING! IF you want more in-depth knowledge and are open to Eastern philosophy and how this workout benefits the bo dy (synovial joints, etc) Jennifer is IT.""",1263340800,2,535,4.8901098901098905
