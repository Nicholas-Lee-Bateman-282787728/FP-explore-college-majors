7952376,4,B00005RI90,"Originally broadcast in 1999 this documentary(which has been updated) attempts to  answer that question. Bill Moyers, our host, and other reporters talk to numerous officials, friends and enemies of this man. What emerges is not a mere biography of bin Ladin but a full scale story about the birth of international terrorism fueled by conditions long ignored by the United States.
  Viewers are given a comprehensive look at the conditions that gave rise to such a man. Born the 17th child of 52 children to a wealthy businessman in Saudi Arabia, bin Ladin was a man without a cause. When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, bin Ladin joined in with other Muslims to rid the country of the Godless communists. The experience radicalized his thoughts as he came back home to confront the corrupt Saudi government which now has allowed the United States to keep its soldiers on Holy soil.
  As far as bin Ladin was concerned the United States was an evil empire that needed to be eradicated. Thus begins a series of plots, twists, turns, assasinations and bombings in bin Ladin's vast network of terrorists. We are shown where his influence was prevelant in someway in the various terrorist attacks world wide.
  Upon viewing this program you will be amazed at his vast web of influence. American viewers will be surprised that some in the Muslim world regard him as a hero. You will also be puzzled as to why the United States has been frustrated in their attempts to capture this most infamous criminal of the 21st century.
  This is an excellent tool in understanding the events and cultural influences that led up to 9-11. Terrorism must be understood from its roots in order for Americans to be able to defend themselves psychologically, emotionally and spiritually. The biggest problem with this film is its shallow treatment of understanding Islam. It speaks about the Jihad but gives it the veneer of being the  only ""doctrine"" of Islam thus stereotyping  all Muslims as being crazed fanatics ready to go on a Jihad for the faith. Such a misrepresentation does no good for those who are Muslim and United States citizens. Indeed another follow up should be done but for now this program gives one some good insight on the conditions that allowed bin Ladin to emerge.",1014854400,11,2269,4.852331606217617
