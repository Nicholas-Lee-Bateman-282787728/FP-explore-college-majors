My 5 year old boy loves these programs. The first two were so enjoyed I bought the rest of the series.
This was a series on tv at one time, apparently. I hope they package the rest of the programs because the show was fab.
Each dvd has 4 episodes that are somewhat related. The 2 kid hosts explore different aspects of each subject.
Some are surprising but all are interesting, informative and professionally made.
In earlier reviews of this series I forgot to mention that grown ups find these programs interesting as well.
My husband and I love them as well.
Don't let the worms on the cover fool you this has other subjects as well. I guess the connection is they are all kind of yucky or underground.",1260057600,2,952,5.56551724137931
8020583,5,B000228SEQ,"I've purchased several of these DVDs for my five year old and he adores them.  It's a shame there aren't more shows like this still on the air.  It's informative, intelligent television viewing.  He learns something while he watches it, and thoroughly enjoys it.  My three year old daughter isn't as captivated by it as my son, but she still gleans information off it as he does.",1108252800,11,379,4.611940298507463
