I could have just made the VHS version into a DVD and would have come up with equal or better quality. I still haven't checked out the other movie yet, but just seems like a very low quality copy so lost interest pretty quickly..If you are a fan of the movies, it at least allows you to see them, but really lacking as far as video quality. I was looking for DVD quality version of a VHS and I got low VHS quality on a DVD.",1495411200,,594,4.129310344827586
8194707,5,B000Q6LESK,"the lightning kung fu title should not be confused with a movie called The Victim. this version is actually called Killer Constable and is heavily based on sword play not your shoalin type kung fu.  overall i find both movies survived the dubbing into english, which can be an accomplishment in itself.  if you're looking for some good entertainment both movies are full of good choreographed fight scenes, mostly sword/weapons based and are based around plots of the a group of highly trained individuals trying to outsmart an evil overlord that lurks in the shadows.  entertaining yes.  going to solve world peace. no.  enjoy them for what they are - entertaining films from the late 70s early 80s.",1342656000,2,700,4.898305084745763
