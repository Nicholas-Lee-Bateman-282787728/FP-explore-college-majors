2798863,3,B000OPOCMS,I really enjoyed this series except for the idiot Tim Sykes. The show covers a different assortment of traders and market professionals which gives a nice overview of some financial people. The hard part to watch is a failed trader named Tim Sykes whose fund is down 36% since January 2006 and has had to resort to fighting for media attention since he can't make money trading. Some of his idiocy is funny at times and sometimes it is downright painful. A good show overall though if you like the stock market. There are only 6 epsiodes of this show and the extras are light and basically pointless so be aware of that before you purchase the 2 DVDs. It is a much smaller DVD set than the average buyer would realize. I know I was very surprised.,1190246400,16,747,4.420289855072464
2798864,3,B000OPOCMS,"Nice to see that the once-hot Tim Sykes enjoyed his little brush with fame, but as the respected ""Trader"" magazine publishes the 2007 list of ""Hottest Traders Under 30,"" our sad little Timmy is nowhee to be found.  Quoting from the magazine's lead paragraph:

""You won't see Cilantro's humility-challenged Tim Sykes, who in the past year has gone from wunderkind to Ryan Leaf-like laughingstock.""

[...]

(Ryan Leaf, for those non-football fans, was the second pick in the 1998 NFL draft -- behind Peyton Manning -- who was such a bust he was out of the league only a few years later.)",1187654400,16,585,4.762376237623762
2798865,5,B000OPOCMS,"As one of the stars of this show, I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out. Most reality shows are pretty rigged, but I'm here to say that this was one is pretty true to real life. Sure, I come off a little too cocky sometimes, but then again, I kind of am; as bad as that sounds, you need that supreme confidence in yourself when you're trading and risking so much money. I do wish they'd focused a little more on my trading itself as some of the edits don't really make sense, but television still hasn't found a visually appealing way to show how intense trading actually is. The cool thing is that all this media exposure I've gotten actually played a large role in inspiring me to write my upcoming book, ""An American Hedge Fund.""

Anyway, I just bought my own copy of the DVD and the bonus features on Disc 2 with all the outtakes are hilarious. I highly recommend this product.",1180569600,18,887,4.311377245508982

2798907,5,B000OPOCMS,"This is a series that shows you why that nowhere in the world can you make it from nothing, as long as you're driven. This series follows people from different parts of Wall Street in each of there respected roles. After watching this it should leave you interested and motivated in investing!",1391558400,,293,4.653846153846154
2798908,4,B000OPOCMS,"Nice look at what really happens behind the headlines. You won't learn any strategies here, but it's good to see they put their pants (And Skirts) on the same way we do!  This series is more about the characters.

In a backhanded way, It helped my trading psychology, as well.",1376524800,,276,4.5
2798909,4,B000OPOCMS,Decent series that documents the day to day activities of various workers and traders on Wall Street. Worth checking out.,1367280000,,121,5.1
2798910,4,B000OPOCMS,"I deceided to buy the entire season 1 based off the first show. It may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy finance and intrested in how the Wallstreeters are living.......you may enjoy. My wife would fall asleep trying to watch this, but seeing their hunger, work ethic, and picking up a tip here and there is what keeps me intrested in the show.",1355875200,4,348,4.369230769230769
2798911,4,B000OPOCMS,"For those who would tune into WALL STREET WARRIORS; believing that this series is some satirical view on capitalism, this may not be for you. WSW is a surface look at the wheels that keep Capitalism rolling along. I find the show to be a breath of fresh air, when it comes to showing how the pursuit of profit, can drive some people in their business activities. I rate this show up there, with APPRENTICE, Season 1. I will definitely be adding this series to my DVD collection. For all TRUE CAPITALIST out there reading this......WELCOME HOME!!",1302912000,,545,4.628865979381444
2798912,5,B000OPOCMS,"It was quite interesting and amusing. The negative reviews came from people who were looking for insight into ""making it"" on Wall Street. The show had a wide spectrum of characters from wanna be,immature buffoons to 60ish veteran floor traders. It was good entertainment.",1291507200,2,271,5.181818181818182
2798913,5,B000OPOCMS,"The First season of this show was pretty good, and the characters a bit more edgy than those in the second season.  Good to watch as one of those fun things on the financial markets if you are into that sort of thing.",1285459200,2,217,4.046511627906977
2798914,3,B000OPOCMS,I started watching during season two. After season two ended I decided I should see season one. It's obvious the producers took a different approach to the show after season one. I'm guessing they did away with the show because I haven't heard anything about it since season 2 ended.  Too bad.,1273708800,,293,4.634615384615385
2798935,4,B000OPOCMS,"If you're a day or swing trader, this is solid enough programming, some good insights and 'sound bites', at least it's a good change from financial news tv/talking heads.

I found it interesting to watch, because there's not much out there on video for active traders, so it was worth seeing at least to watch perspectives from a handful of traders, to hear how they think about trading.  Other reviews here are pretty much on target.  Well-produced, fast paced and interesting.  ""Must see"" for active traders.",1225843200,,510,4.895348837209302
2798936,4,B000OPOCMS,I thought the dvd was entertaining but I didn't live up to my expectations as far as the daily going ons on wall street goes. It was a little superficial.,1220659200,,154,4.166666666666667
2798937,2,B000OPOCMS,"This show was based on a series of interviews with various Wall Street folks.

While somewhat interesting in places, overall I was disappointed.

Any advice about investing or success on Wall Street was extremely vague, and mostly sounded like standard business platitudes.

The common theme from the traders shown was that their job life is frenetic.  The pace and style is, ironically, exactly opposite the tried and true methodology for the vast majority of successful INVESTORS (i.e. as opposed to speculators) - as described by legendary folks like John Bogle and Warren Buffett.

Timothy Sykes, a day trader who had made a killing in the post-internet market collapse (as a microcap short biased trader -- he was obviously in the right place at the right time) was a perfect example of the hyperactive, overconfident, and self-congratulatory 20-somethings that are playing the Wall Street game.  These folks seem to have NO clue that making $10 million to $100 million on Wall Street by trading is about as realistic for 99++% of traders as the ghetto kid who is convinced he'll make the NBA by playing basketball instead of studying. I guess the youth get their drive from dreaming big.

(To his credit, Tim does admit he was lucky when he made his big gains). On the other hand, he talks about the need to control emotions, but is constantly very emotional when he trades and discusses his trading. He also seems completely random to me as he trades -- basically, he's a technician who gets his contrarian ideas from Wall Street and technical publications.  Not exactly unique. Not exactly insightful, though apparently delusional.

Another common theme was an extreme attachment to wealth and the arrogance the taste of wealth (like a house in the Hamptons, a fancy car, and fancy food, etc) gained clearly implied -- that folks who couldn't afford such a thing are clearly inferior to the folks that can.  I guess this is all too predictable, but I was hoping folks who are supposedly so brilliant or talented or socially in tune would have a BIT of perspective or social insight into how the world works.

Most of the folks, like a specialist or a futures floor trader just explained the basics of what their jobs entail.  Nothing insightful there at all.

I was hoping to get some meaningful insight into what some of the truly genius folks on Wall Street do and how they think. maybe some useful insight into what to read or how to do research (more sophisticated than seeing how prevalent a brand of blue jeans are in certain stores).

If you are an investor looking to actually learn something - take a big pass on this title.",1218153600,14,2641,4.788546255506608
2798938,5,B000OPOCMS,"I trade stocks from home a little bit and the show inspired me.  Best parts were the trading floors, Alex and Tim  turning $16,000 into $1.5 million.  It doesn't get very detailed on the technical side of finance, which I guess is good because that would be kind of boring.  I've caught a few episodes of the new season on TV - it's pretty entertaining, especially the 28-year-old Hedge-fund Manager who runs a $100 million fund - Damn! I got to go back to school!",1207526400,8,464,4.423529411764706
2798939,5,B000OPOCMS,"I watched it with my wife and she loved it too.  We had a great time and enjoyed the characters.  For some reason it capture my attention.  Finally a show to distract my wife from Project Runway.  I'm going to kill her if she stays with that crap.  I mean, come on, another one of these woman shows with models prancing around?  Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm enjoying the show this year.  Its slicker graphics and faster pace set it apart from the other shows on Mojo.  Please let me know when episode 2 is going on sale.  Because my stockbrokering cousin will die when he sees his colleagues on TV.  I heard about the Sandisk thing and I know its been up and down, so I'm wondering where that's going to go.",1201824000,2,711,4.2
2798940,5,B000OPOCMS,"I just purchased Wall Street Warriors, Season 1 and watched the entire series in one sitting.  I have to say I enjoyed it immensely.  It felt more like a documentary series than most ""reality"" shows (which I can't bare to watch).  The featured players ranged from the young and foolish to the established and revered, all of whom had their own take and approach to the apparent madness and rush of Wall Street.  I found it fascinating to follow each character as they go about their daily routines, contending with a wild market that has a mind of its own.  The series is both highly entertaining and informative - a balance which most shows lack in this day and age.  Definitely looking forward to Season 2!",1201737600,5,708,4.579365079365079
2798941,2,B000OPOCMS,"I saw this season's programs on MOJO.  Man, I can't believe how boring the entire series was.  The producers obviously couldn't get any real professional Wall Street traders to be featured on the show, so they took what they could.  I still remember how embarassed I was for folks like Tim Sykes sitting in his little apartment wearing a ragged, threadbare housecoat and complaining how his mother didn't have time to do his laundry that week.  And another classic was watching a market maker at AMEX stare over the shoulders of a floor trader punching buttons into a machine while ominous music played in the background, as if that was something exciting.  This is your job?  And the AMEX....jeez, what an irrelevant place to work.  Please don't waste your money on this.",1198886400,3,772,4.803030303030303

8186155,1,B000OPOCMS,"I feel like I watched a different show than other reviewers because they seem to be praising the most boring reality show on all of television and I just can't understand it.

As a Prime member, this show is being offered (right now) as season 1 ep 1 included with Prime and all others have to be bought. I see in other reviews people talk about not getting any stock tips. Huh? I thought this was just another trashy reality show, and I believe I'm the one who's supposed to be right here and the other reviewers thinking this is some kind of info-mentary are wrong. The problem is, just as it fails for them as an info-mentary, so does it fail monumentally as a trashy reality show. There's no drama there. There's nothing to hold our interest. The back drop of Wall Street seems like it'd be rife with drama but in reality ""suits"" aren't interesting at all. That's kind of the whole point of 'suits', they are boring, predictable, humans who wear their pinstrips with their blue button-ups and their solid blacks with their vibrant ties when they want to show how crazy they can get. lol

Bottom line, trading stocks seems like it'd provide drama but instead it's businessmen doing what businessmen do - grinding out their lives in boring fashion just like all the rest of us. Nothing worth seeing and certianly nothing worth paying for. My own job is more interesting and unique and I'm only a middle class worker bee.",1456876800,,1422,4.55078125
