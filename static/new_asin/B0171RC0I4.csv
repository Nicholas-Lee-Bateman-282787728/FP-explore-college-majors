8737887,3,B0171RC0I4,"I want to emphasize that this is really a 2 star movie B or C or D movie.  I only put 3 stars because the Amazon description says at 2 stars ""I hated it"".  I didn't hate it. It's just OK.  This is clearly a ""let's get some friends and make a film student movie"" effort.  It looks like it has a budget of about $2000.  The drama is confusing going from amateurish and lame in some places to very well done atmospheric noir in others, the acting veers from barely above tolerable to very good.  Due to the low budget, you kinda get taken out of the story when you can tell that a Thanksgiving dinner looks like it takes place on the grounds of a country club or resort instead of someone's back yard or a prop is clearly a plastic toy.  I'm still not sure what story the filmmakers were trying tell.

SPOILERS FOLLOW:

Our hero Sean comes back home to a small town in the Florida everglades after a tour in Afghanistan clearly suffering PTSD after being held as a POW.  He stops to greet his girlfriend Lexi who he wants to propose to, but before he can she admits she wants to move on from him.  He has flashbacks of something really bloody, disturbing and supernatural happening to him while he was being held as a POW but you can't really tell what. Something cannabalistic, either forced or not or just imaginary.  He goes to visit his friend Matt's family, with whom he served, only to find out that his buddy, after arriving home, packed up and ran off.  His parents, the Kingstons are native Americans.  They don't know why their son ran off.  Sean joins his brother Sonny, and other family friends at the Kingstons for their annual Thanksgiving dinner during which the mother breaks down after having a vision that a curse on white people was coming down on them all.  The ""Wind Walker"".  Why this should be happening is not clear.  Sean, his brother Sonny and their other friends, including the missing Matt's father Neelis and his younger brother Jake, then embark the next day on their annual hunting trip where they hunt wild pigs in the marsh.  They canoe to their destination and walk through eerie high sedges to find their remote cabin has been vandalized.  They clean it up and as they wait for dawn, drinking and joking, they realize Sean is not all there.  He's distant and remote and insulting, especially to his brother Sonny, mocking him for not having the balls to enlist when he and Matt did.  The next day they go hunting, going off in teams of two.  Sean is teamed with the Kingston's younger son Jake.  After Jake makes him miss a shot of a boar, due to blundering inadvertently on the scene, Sean takes aim at him with his hunting rifle.  The shot is heard off screen.  Did Sean kill him?  Was he aiming at something else?  The trip dissolves into pandemonium as they find their canoes destroyed, stranding them, and people start to disappear, survivors only finding bloody clothing.  The tension and suspicion of each other grows deadly, especially as they discover Sean is on anti-psychotic drugs and all of them are hunters who are armed.  Is Sean killing people?  Is it some supernatural entity that chased him from Afghanistan?  Is the killer his missing buddy Matt doing a psycho Rambo act?  The transistor radio they listen to, with bad reception, reports on a hurricane looming, people evacuating, and then they start hearing vague reports of a new disease starting to spread, people getting sick, and it appears the zombie apocalypse is upon them.  Or is it just a product of their imaginations?  It's a mish mash of many horror stories, and mind messing, and finally is just lame, but the isolated atmosphere is really well done.",1527206400,,3665,4.551987767584098
