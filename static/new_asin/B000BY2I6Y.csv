Here is what people are saying about ""Voices In Exile""

""Voices in Exile,"" which chronicles the struggle of the Tibetan people for their culture and for their very lives, is the most important film you can see this year...a mini-masterpiece"" -Norman Shoaf, City Editor, Antelope Valley Press (full article to follow)

""'Voices in Exile' paints an endearing portrait of a refugee community that still dreams of returning home.""

-John Beck, Santa Rosa Press Democrat (full article)

""This film, ""made on a begging bowl budget,"" is a heartfelt and enlightening appeal to the world to honor the Tibetan freedom struggle."" By Sita Stuhlmiller, Light of Consciousness - Winter, 2005 (full article)

""Voices in Exile,""... (The Tibetan's) dedication to be an example of how powerful a nonviolent approach can be produced a compelling example of activism in Antrugtsang's film making debut.""

- K. Baur, The Antioch Record, Yellow Springs, Ohio

""'Voices in Exile' is an amazing documentary that touches one's heart! Sadly, this story of triumph in the face of adversity has escaped media coverage for far too long. While watching, I was overcome with emotion--tears, frustration at the circumstances surrounding the exiled monks, and yet, I found inspiration in their faith. Too often when we are not directly affected by a harmful situation, we become complacent in our actions. It is my hope that ""Voices of Exile"" will enlighten the world to the lives of these amazing people who only wish to live their lives in peace."" -Tamara Seiler TSDivis Studios out of North Carolina

""Tenzin has managed to capture an impressive, yet complex picture of the Tibetan community in Exile. It is refreshing to find an entirely Tibetan expression of refugee life and hope for the future."" - Huw Slater, Secretary, Victorian Branch Australian Tibet Council

Dear Wangden, Joe Mickey and Sazzy Varga: ""There is something I'd like to thank the ""Voices in Exile"" producer and others for. Your documentary ""Voices in Exile"" brought a new method of introducing Tibetan voices. These particular voices being those speaking on behalf of their respective organizations. I found that quite helpful, as I am very aware of the highly varied viewpoints among Tibetan diaspora, yet had not seen, nor heard those individuals themselves. Your documentary allowed me to listen and be able to more fully converse with my fellow Tibetan friends around the globe regarding the rapidly evolving changes within their community and the future of Tibet. Thanks so much for a wonderfully well done documentary.""
