6373803,5,B00JKTFQJM,When I was growing up In Sydney it would air before the classic Werewolf series which we will probably never see. This really was a great take on the masters work with much better effects. I'm thrilled at the thought of seeing these again. Here's to the golden egg heads...He he he inside joke to the real fans,1402358400,9,310,4.362068965517241
6373804,3,B00JKTFQJM,"The discs come in a single large plastic snap case. The discs play fine, but I have my doubts about how long the plastic snap case will hold together. The middle part that holds the discs has already separated from the outer case.

The second Twilight Zone (1985-1989) show isn't as enjoyable as the original series even though the second show is in color and the original show was in black and white. There were only a few episodes in the show I found memorable: Cold Reading was brilliant and hilarious. A Day in Beaumont was a wonderful fifties era science fiction alien invasion tale reminiscent of shows like The Invaders (1967-1968). The Cold Equations is a classic science fiction story. And Cat and Mouse was enjoyable with a funny ending.

The problem I have with all the Twilight Zones and Outer Limits and X-Files shows is that the episodes are hit and miss. If you're a science fiction fan but don't appreciate horror you have to wade through a lot of horror episodes to get to the stuff you love. I haven't seen The Outer Limits (1995-2002) in years. Like The Twilight Zone (1985-1989) most of The Outer Limits (1995-2002) episodes are horror, with a sprinkling of great science fiction episodes. The Outer Limits episode The Light Brigade (1996) is an example, but its incorrectly labeled fantasy and horror on IMDb instead of science fiction like it should be labeled. Quality of Mercy (1995) is another example of a great sci-fi episode incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror. Star Crossed (1999) is another example of a sci-fi episode incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror.

All of the episodes in The Outer Limits (1995-2002) are labeled the same so if you're a sci-fi fan you cant pick and choose just the sci-fi episodes to watch on Amazon, unless you have a great memory or took notes if you watched the show before, and the discs that have been put out are either of poor quality or overpriced.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520380800,,2958,5.05327868852459

6373811,3,B00JKTFQJM,"The 1980's Twilight Zone stood tall against other sci-fi offerings on TV at the time, but seldom matched the quality of the original series. Boasting great writers, actors and directors; the show failed to build an audience and ended after 65 episodes and 3 seasons. Highlights include ""Button Button"", ""The Once and Future King"", and ""The Helgramite Method"".

The positives here include some well written and acted episodes in each season, and some appearances by some biggest actors in Hollywood. There are also some nice audio commentaries on many of the episodes.

The negatives include just so-so picture quality and sound. Many episodes are in mono and this looks like it was not remastered from the original elements. The picture quality is very watchable, but it is far from the quality of even the original Twilight Zone, which was shot on 35mm film and then remastered. The spindle packaging that holds the DVDs is also awkward and hard to get the discs in and out. Also, there was no booklet listing the episodes and segments.

I paid $30 new for the whole series on Amazon, and it retails for about twice that. A good show that is seldom available in syndication, or
streaming services. Look for a sale, and do not expect the same quality as the original show. Also, you may want to check out Rod Serling's other show, Night Gallery, now on sale.",1513555200,2,1358,4.770212765957447

6373819,2,B00JKTFQJM,"Very disappointing. Get the complete definitive collection done by Rod Serling even if it is a little expensive. This 80's collection had great movie stars as the cast, but many of the stories are lame, in some cases incomplete in its thrust, and lacks the punch of the original twilight zone episodes.

Watching it again decades later, some of the stories hold up very well (both in the story and the acting), while others are cringe-worthy.  On the whole, it's still good enough to keep and watch again in another year or two.  Oddly, some of the stories I remembered fondly and which caused me to look for this DVD set, turned out to be the ones I enjoyed least all these years later, and some that I didn't remember at all turned out to be the most enjoyable.

6373835,5,B00JKTFQJM,"I only saw a few episodes of this show when it was originally being aired.  I love all things Twilight Zone and Outer Limits (and other shows that mess with your head) though, and the price was great, so I bought this set.  I am not even totally through the first disc yet, but I am very happy with it so far.  Some of the episodes are awesome (3 short stories to an episode), while others are just okay and some even kind of weak around the edges.  For the most part though, I think the show was well done and I am glad I made the purchase.  It is funny to see the old style telephones everywhere and lots of people smoking, but like the original 1960's series, most of the stories still stand the test of time as far as being interesting and entertaining even though they go back many years now.

While these episodes are very good in their own right, I still fine myself unconsciously comparing the writing and acting to the '60's series.....and there is no comparison. The '60's series has a life and radiance that no other ""Twilight Zone"" has, or can, ever duplicate.

Don't take me wrong. This ""80's series is still worth buying and watching and there are hidden ""gems"" within. Just let it stand on its own and refrain from comparing it to the '60's series. I'm keeping this in my collection.....right next to the '60's series.",1490572800,4,589,4.718446601941747

The season 3 disc 2 the scratches some appear sporadic across disc surface from being lose but there is a large group of scratches about 1x1 inch that follow the curvature of the disc.  I checked disc for scratches and noticed them before I attempted to play/load disc.

6373841,3,B00JKTFQJM,"I seldom write reviews but I sort of felt it was necessary with this. First, let me say I'm a 46 year old man who used to watch this 80's version of TZ when I was a teenager. My favorite story has always been The Shadow Man, which creeped me out fierce. I have also been watching the original TZ's hosted by Rod Serling himself and so I have fresh memories to compare. One thing that I miss from the old series is that a fair number of stories took place in remote areas like deserts or in other time periods and sometimes with only one or two characters (The Invaders, for example, one of my favorites from the 50's show). It is precisely because of that that the original TZ had some genuinely strange stories. This 80's series does not span out that far. All the stories take place in a modern era, with modern clothing and hairstyles and a looser, hipper flare to it. Unfortunately, that ""modern"" style now looks very dated and cheesy. And some of the actual storylines are just silly.  I laughed a lot more at more episodes than I wanted to.

The picture and sound quality leave a lot to be desired as they were made mostly on videotape and the quality degrades. I expected that but even so, viewers today, including myself, have gotten used to high definition and excellent sound so, between the cheesy 80's feel to it and the low picture and sound quality, it can be hard to enjoy a lot of the stories.

One thing that must be mentioned though is the opening theme. It is almost like a more sinister version of Doctor Who, with no narration, just some very dark, surreal imagery, finalized by a foggy, windblown image of Rod Serling's face and then a skull and crossbones that morphs into the Twilight Zone title. Absolutely perfect!

Finally, the packaging. Other reviewers here are talking about all the DVDs put onto a spindle. My copy came in a much better packaging. Inside the box is a set of plastic ""pages"" that hold two discs each, one overlapping the other, so you can open it up, like a book, and take out whatever disc you like. I was impressed actually, some of the best packaging I've seen for a DVD series.",1487894400,4,2128,4.407124681933842
6373842,3,B00JKTFQJM,"I purchased this to add to my Twilight Zone collection but it falls short of the Original in both story, acting, and production quality.

The 1980's shows were filmed on Panavision Cameras with Panaflex lenses, but the transfer to DVD quality is really poor. Often too dark, grainy,  and you can see the vertical lines of the transfer screen in most of the episodes.

The writing is sub-par on most episodes and fails to delivery the depth and meaning that Rod Serling worked hard to build into Twilight Zone.
Rod Serling wrote episodes that had hidden meanings in both social and moral categories. There was always an ""Ahhh HA"" moment in Rod's original Twilight Zone episodes and a much deeper meaning that drove to the heart of the human condition.
The 1980's Twilight Zone FAILS BIG TIME on this, and delivers just a so,so viewing experience, and even some poor stories that leave you wondering what the heck you just watched.

However, there are a rare few episodes that are good, and it's part of the Twilight Zone history, so I purchased it. Good to watch on a rainy night when you are bored and can't sleep.

Packing: Comes in a single large Plastic DVD Case that holds all Discs in multiple trays. Silver screen print on Discs. The menu design could be better but works good.",1487376000,4,1283,4.634361233480176

I'm 71 and remember the series from when it was new on TV and the Quality of these CBS - DVD's is much better. My favorite episode back then was 'Nightsong' and at the end there is a nice close-up of Simon Locke and not only can you see the details of his blue eyes but you can even see a flea flying around his head / I know you could not see that back in the 80's with the poor TV quality at that time. At the price of $40.00 for this 13 disk set I think your definitely getting you moneys worth. That's my opinion anyway - hope it helps. - Frank,1459382400,,726,3.879194630872483

6373869,4,B00JKTFQJM,"Great show, a lot of content for the current price on amazon, I was a bit taken back that the quality looks like VHS, but I'm reading in the reviews that the company is claiming they did the best they could with the source material they had to work with so it is what it is, I also don't love the packaging, and a booklet would've been nice, but all in all it's a good show if you like shows like The Outer Limits, Amazing Story's, Tales From The Crypt, ect., this is definitly worth having in your collection, I like it better than Tales From The Dark Side, Ray Bradbury Theater or Friday The Thirteeth, it's a well done sci-fi show with good actors, story's, directors ect..",1447372800,3,676,4.2890625

6373873,4,B00JKTFQJM,"Great collection of stories. For those interested, some seasons in this particular item are close captioned, but I haven't found any to be subtitled. Another peculiararity is that some discs have the option to ""play all"" which I really like, while other discs you must play each episode one at a time. Still, I'm grateful Twilight Zone was continued even though Rod Serling has undoubtedly turned over in his grave many times due to some stories he most likely would cringe because there is his name, indelibly linked.

6373875,4,B00JKTFQJM,"I originally only watched a few episodes here and there of this series during its original run in the 80's so I didn't get a very strong flavor. Last year I decided to pick up the complete set on Amazon since it was selling at a decent price.

After having watched it for awhile, I'd say that at most I am moderately excited about this 1980's version of the Twilight Zone. The stories don't quite have the same impact as the Rod Serling original but they do have their moments. Also lots of familiar faces from the 80's appearing in this show.

Special features consist mostly of commentary tracks for many of the episodes which adds extra value to the set(but some of the commentary tracks have low audio quality unfortunately). And lastly count me in as one of those who are not pleased about the crappy packaging. Still a good set to get if you are a fan of the Twilight Zone especially with the budget price for the complete series.",1443830400,9,936,4.436046511627907

I only gave 3 stars because it's impossible not to compare it to the classic original, whose black and white presentation and roots in a past that no longer exist really give it an otherworldly quality that is missing here. My favorite, thus far, is ""A Message From Charity"", featuring a pre-Star Trek Voyager Robert Duncan McNeill!  Overall, I think it was a worthy revival attempt.

One big gripe is the picture and sound quality. I understand that this was lensed with 80s technology, but even so...it feels like one is watching 2nd or 3rd generation copies of videocassettes.",1425686400,2,681,4.811965811965812

For those of you who were around in the 80's the picture is just fine, in fact, I actually like the old school look of it, frankly I hate seeing old shows and movies in Hi-Def, they just don't look right.

Now if this set had cost $100 I might think some of these complaints are justified, but considering you get all 3 seasons for a cheap price this is a great set, and as I say, if you still have a love for how media looked in the 80's (which is when this show was made) you won't even have any complaints about the picture anyway, in fact as I say to me it's better this way.",1421539200,17,737,3.97972972972973

The video quality borders on fair to poor and leaves quite a bit to be desired.  There is film grain and scratches in a few frames here and there throughout.  It is original full frame and looks to be transferred from videotape.  This cannot be helped much anyway as it was the way many shows were filmed in the 1980's.  Shot on film in widescreen and edited to videotape in fullscreen.  The original film prints were usually tossed once the videotape master was created.  It's a shame, as they probably no longer exist.  The packaging is a let down.  All 13 discs on top of each other in a stack on a single plastic spindle.

6373923,4,B00JKTFQJM,"Provides the full set of Twilight Zone videos from the 1980s, but the quality is well below other DVD videos.  It's about the quality you would have seen on cable TV in the 1980s.  It could benefit a lot from digital remastering to reduce the noise and improve the clarity.  These videos would probably look decent on an analog TV, but a new digital TV really brings out their flaws.

That being said, the stories themselves are excellent, and it is a gas to see many of today's major studio stars in their younger days. I personally find the themes in the original Twilight Zone a bit too pedantic and overly moralistic.  These stories are presented without the overly dramatic moral overtones of the older series, and I like that much better.  And of course, it is nice to see the stories in living color.  :-)

That being said, I bought this set as a companion to my blu-ray complete set of the original series (I know there isn't a demand to get this series remastered in hi-def and on Blu-Ray, but I'd buy it if it was). Very exciting to see all those episodes listed inside the package.

Where this complete DVD collection falters is in its horrible packaging.  For whatever reason ($), Image Entertainment opted to have all 13 discs stacked onto a single cheap plastic spindle.  Which, aside from being a pain to deal with as far as getting to the disc you want to watch, does nothing to protect the discs.  I ended up putting all 13 discs into 2-disc slim CD jewel cases and putting those into the outer box.

We will call this the poor mans packaging.  Still, I love these episode and as long as I don't manhandle the box too much, it's worth the $30!! Oh and the disc being on top of each other is no big deal.

6373936,4,B00JKTFQJM,"The Twilight Zone was the first great TV anthology series with tales of science fiction, fantasy, horror, and mystery, hosted by legendary creator Rod Serling.  The original series ran for five seasons from 1959  1964 and has gone through two modern day revivals.  The first was in the 1980s running for three seasons.  The complete 1980s series is collected in this set from Image Entertainment.

Like the original 1950s/1960s series, the 1980s series featured the talents of an incredible array of actors, writers, and directors; a testament to how influential and revered the original series was in the annals of TV history.  Writers included Harlan Ellison, Robert McCammon, Ray Bradbury, Joe Haldeman, Atchur C. Clarke, Theodore Sturgeon, Richard Matheson, Roger Zelanzy, George R.R. Martin, J. Michael Straczynski, and Stephen King.

Directors included Wes Craven, William Friedkin, Tommy Lee Wallace, Joe Dante, John Milius, and David Steinberg.  Actors included Bruce Willis, Robert Klein, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Scott Wilson, Peter Coyote, Martin Balsam, William Petersen, Frances Conroy, and more.  You can see, particularly from the roster of writers that the 1980s show could stand toe-to-toe with the original.

The show was formatted somewhat differently than the original.  The first two seasons featured two or three different stories within the hour timeframe while the third season was a half hour in length.  The series kicked off with shatterday based on a Harlan Ellison story about a man (Bruce Willis) who makes a phone call to his alter ego.

Nightcrawlers is based on a story written by horror writer Robert McCammon about a Vietnam vet who abandoned his unit and is now being hunted down by spectral soldiers.  Button, button was based on the story of the same name by Richard Matheson and would be turned into a 2009 big screen film called The Box.  One day Arthur and Norma Lewis, receive a mysterious locked box with a button on it.  Then, a smartly dressed stranger who introduces himself as Steward comes to their door.  He gives Norma the key to the box and explains that, if they press the button, two things will happen: they will receive $200,000, and someone ""whom they don't know"" will die.

The 80s series also remade several episodes from the original run including  ""Dead Mans Shoes"", ""Shadow Play"", and ""Night of the Meek"".  The 1980s series could be uneven in terms of quality.  In particular the third season had fewer episodes created by some of the better writers and directors and definitely suffered from a lack of quality which would lead to its ultimate cancelation.  Still, the 1980s Twilight Zone series is quite good and underrated.",1411776000,18,2691,5.082004555808656

Now im frantic looking for dvd cases, that hold more than 2-3 dvds and are slim enough to fit in the box. Love the series, crappy packaging!",1410998400,6,441,4.188235294117647
6373939,3,B00JKTFQJM,"The show itself is pretty cheesy and mediocre compared to the original, but that's to be expected. I didn't buy this series for the quality programming but I was hoping for a bit more quality packaging. The discs themselves come stacked on top of each other in a flimsy plastic tray inside of the box. The quality of the episodes themselves look like they have been ripped from VHS or extremely low quality DVD. If you just want the show to have it then buy it but if you are hoping for something with a little more flare I would wait for another release.",1410739200,2,555,4.346153846153846
6373940,5,B00JKTFQJM,This is the 80s version  of The Twilight Zone and it has a lot of good episodes starting with its pilot Shatterday which is actually one of two good stories in that episode the other one being A Little Peace and Quiet.  Other good  stories are Dealers Choice I of Newton Night of the Meek  Nightsong But Can She Type The Misfortune Cookie Time and Teressa Golowitzh The Call The Card Her Pilgrim Soul The Once and Future King The Star Kentucky Rye Childrens Zoo Little Boy Lost Tooth and Consequence Nightcrawlers and many others.  You should get this.,1410393600,23,552,4.5353535353535355
6373941,4,B00JKTFQJM,"Anthologies are a rarity on TV nowadays, of course nothing comes close in popularity to the original Rod Serling version of the Fifties, but this is a fairly decent revival, 2 - 3 stories by world famous authors (e.g. Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, Harlan Ellison) per episode. There were a number of popular anthologies over the years, namely The Outer Limits, Alfred Hitchcock Presents (also had a color revival), Masters of Horror, Amazing Stories (Spielberg), Friday The 13th. the Series, Tales From The Darkside, Tales From The Crypt, Monsters, Goosebumps. Are You Afraid Of The Dark, Freddy's Nightmares the series, Twilight Zone the 90's series, Night Gallery (also Sterling) and Night Visions (hoping for this release).

In fact , this 80's version was released in 2 separate packages over 10 years ago at a much higher price, around $70 each, so this is a bargain at this price. But some people might find a down side because of the packaging, 13 discs sitting on a spool in a booklike case with no protection between the discs. But there is an episode guide on the inside covers that includes a listing of the guest stars for each episode, a welcome bonus. And all the extra features are included like in the original release, commentaries, deleted scenes, interview with Wes Craven.

The highlight of this series has to be the first episode of the second season, ""The Once And Future King"", a clever, compelling, loving tribute to Elvis Presley starring Jeff Yagher, who has his voice down solid pat and even includes 3 songs, 'Heartbreak Hotel', 'That's All Right Mama' and ""Are You Lonesome Tonight'. There's commentary on this episode by Philip DeGuere who calls this the perfect Twilight Zone story.

Actually, after using this package several times, I began to like this idea of the stacking discs, the top one slides out easily, there is a cardboard stopper that holds them in place, and when you're finished watching, you just slide out the whole cylinder, which also slides out easily, and then replace the one you watched on the bottom, so the next one to be viewed is always on the top. There really isn't much chance of scratching the disc, on a standard package, some discs are packed so tight in their holders, that you practically have to bend them to get them out.

However the picture quality is varied throughout, but is fairly good overall, but this is explained by Alan Brennert, one of the original writer producers of the show.

""As one of the writer-producers who contributed to this series, I'm posting this to correct some misapprehensions concerning the picture quality of this DVD set. This is NOT a ""bad transfer."" The 1985-87 Twilight Zone was shot on film, but edited on video. In other words, the raw footage was 35mm film, which was then transferred to videotape. Editing, dubbing, special effects--everything was done on video. (We were in fact the first drama series on television to do this.) So unlike the original Rod Serling TZ, there ARE no original film negatives from which Image could strike new prints for transfer. All that exist are the old one-inch master tapes the fact that the original transfers had deteriorated over time""

Still, if you're OK with this and the packaging, there are a great deal of interesting stories with some of the great actors of the time, well worth getting.",1409616000,84,3338,4.837127845884413
6373942,4,B00JKTFQJM,Could they have produced this with a crappier package? A plastic bowl and just stacking the DVDs on top of one another? Other than that the show it's self was much better then you could have hoped for because nothing can beat the original Twilight Zone. I especially liked the episode But Can SheType? And also The Misfortune Cookie. Over the shows entire run there were hit or miss episodes but for the most part very well done.,1409356800,7,429,4.512820512820513
6373943,5,B00JKTFQJM,"TTZ was rebooted for three brief seasons when I was a teen and while clearly not the original, it still entertains, telling tales laced with irony, just desserts, and random bad luck.  I have spent the past several days of my vacation watching episode after episode, many of which are just as delightful and thrilling as I remember them to be so long ago.  Some great names grace these stories, too, and I feel Rod Serling would be honored by them.  If you're a fan of the original, I strongly encourage you to give this package your consideration and unless you're absolutely allergic to reminders of the 80's you should escape their lessons unscathed yet enlightened :-)",1409356800,43,672,4.726495726495727
