6365418,4,B00JK322I6,"Fast paced backstage Grable musical with two leading men John Payne and Victor Mature competing for her attention. Some nice musical numbers, one of which has Grable tap dancing with choreographer Hermes Pan.  Phil Silvers provides some comedy relief.  Also in the cast are Jane Wyman (on loan out from WB), James Gleason and Cobina Wright Jr.  Seeing a Grable musical in B&W seems a bit odd",1402444800,,391,4.8059701492537314
6365419,4,B00JK322I6,"Footlight Serenade (1942) has John Payne and Victor Mature
competing for Betty Grable's affections, but Betty is already
secretly married to John. They are all appearing in a Broadway
show starring boxing champ, Victor Mature. When Mature learns
the truth on opening night, the boxing match, within the show,
becomes a real brawl. Jane Wyman, Phil Silvers
and James Gleason co-star.

This is a fun, tuneful musical comedy in black and white.
Betty has some nice song and dance routines, including
""I Heard The Birdies Sing"" in which she dances and boxes
with her shadow. She even dances with the talented Hermes Pan.

There is one unfortunate aspect to this film. The big ""Marching
To A Love Song"" finale was cut from the film before it was released
because those in charge felt it didn't work, so they used it
in a Movietone short: ""All-Star Bond Rally"" to raise money for
the War effort. The last moments of the finale can still be seen
in this film, but the entire number can be seen on the
Hidden Hollywood II dvd. (thanks to Lon for that information)

Fox Cinema Archives dvd looks excellent with no serious problems.
There are no extras.",1398470400,4,1143,4.705

8651651,3,B00JK322I6,"The first part of this musical is exuberant and entertaining. The musical numbers are not great but Betty Grable shows spunk and vitality and has real charm. The second part of the movie is a tiresome pretense of Betty and John Payne pretending not to be married in order to appease the star, Victor Mature. This kind of clumsy plot gives musicals a bad name and rightly so. Phil Silver is tiresome and not funny as the supposed comic relief.",1403568000,,442,4.5375
