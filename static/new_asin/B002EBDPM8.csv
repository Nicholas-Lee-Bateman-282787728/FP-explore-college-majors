8367444,5,B002EBDPM8,"Even after reading (and loving) Dave Elman's class book, _Hypnotherapy_, I was never a big fan of the famous Elman induction. I tried it a few times while in training, but I never seemed to get the results Elman claimed it could produce--so I moved on to other inductions that were more my style and produced (for me) great results.

So I was curious when Sean Michael Andrews (aka Donald Patterson) announced that he was making a video entirely about the Elman induction. When I saw that it came in a package deal with an interview of Dave Elman's son, I decided to take the plunge. If nothing else, the interview would be worth the price, as it would surely shed some insight into the work of one of the most important hypnotists of the 20th Century.

Well, I was not disappointed by the interview, and I was extremely impressed with the instructional video. Patterson's teaching style is excellent, and for once, here is a hypnosis video with high production values. After watching the video once, I found that the menu made it easy to zip right to the parts I needed to review.

After only a little study of the video, I find that I'm now getting great results with an induction I had previously had trouble wrapping my head around. The section on deepeners was helpful as well.

Patterson really thought this product through. It's details like the insert with a copy of the induction script that show you that this video is a labor of love, a fitting tribute to a hypnotist who changed the world.

In short, this DVD set should be on every hypnotist's shelf.",1255737600,6,1563,4.567857142857143
