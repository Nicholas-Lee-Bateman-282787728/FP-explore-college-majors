It seems like it was filmed from the cinema with a very bad camera...",1337126400,,107,3.909090909090909
7957996,1,B000062XI8,"I am really shocked that someone can sell this ""quality"" dvd. The story is okay, if you can see it, as it jumps and is not sharp in any way, you can't see the titles half of the time, it says you can switch them of, but you can't. It looks like they download it from Internet together with fansubs and burn it on dvd. It is really pitty, as Simon Yam is great as usual and the movie as such too. Shame on the company!",1236729600,,417,3.86046511627907
7957997,3,B000062XI8,"CASINO, a movie filmed in Macau (former Portuguese

autonomous territory, apart from mainland China),

directed by Billy Tang, and released in 1998 is a

riveting, absorbing movie, with an original story, a

reasonably attractive filming location ( Macau ), a

talented cast, attractive visuals and cool music.

The lesson of this movie, is that, wherever there's easy money

to be made - by running gambling operations that have

exorbitantly high profit margins (card games, etc.) - a

competitive element will be present (here, in the form of many

gangs), strife and warfare as well, as each gang sets their

sights on domination. Law enforcement's only approach in

controlling the overall societal problem, is to have a key

man, playing the diplomat between the gangs, hoping to

keep the public's attention away from these criminal

elements,  to maintain their confidence in the political

administation, in this case, Portuguese (until late 1990's.)

At one point in the movie, a police chief tells the Asian

gangs, and his ""diplomat""  delegate, in the aftermath of

a murder, ""Settle this problem among yourselves"" - not wanting

to approach the Asian phenomenon with a European solution.

Some fascinating aspects, in this Asian production, are

the charismatic actors and actresses, the historical filming

locations, the relaxing overall mood conveyed by the picture,

and the ongoing struggle to maintain order in the territory.

The soundtrack is well done, facilitating the laying out of a

mood to the action sequences, etc. There's a number of

luxury autos, as well - Ferrari, Porsche, etc. as driven

by the mobsters. A curious aspect, is perhaps the  frightening

hordes, literally, in modern times, of bikers and gangsters

roaming the streets, carrying out assaults and vandalism,

overruning their competitors poker games, caausing havoc, etc.

Finally, the main weakness, of this movie, is the digital transfer.

The TV panning severely degrades the quality of the

release, as opposed to a letter-box or rectangular release

that would  have benefitted greatly this movie, as well as

the readability of the subtitles, for those not fluent in

Mandarin.

Overall, this is a quality theatrical release, professional

in all aspects,  that surely captivated the senses of the

paying public, and my own, and that did not disappoint.",1169769600,,2358,5.2710027100271
