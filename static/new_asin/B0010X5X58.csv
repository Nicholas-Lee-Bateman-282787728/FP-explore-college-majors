However, if you want to see actual hockey, look elsewhere--it ain't here.  The previous ""NHL All-Access"" DVD, released back in 2001, was a fun look behind the scenes of the game, from the expansion draft to the broadcasting booth, spotlighting historic games such as Patrick Roy's career wins record and Wayne Gretzky's final game.  This disc (save for the final five minutes, centering around the Stanley Cup) is a snoozefest.",1217116800,,562,5.021505376344086
