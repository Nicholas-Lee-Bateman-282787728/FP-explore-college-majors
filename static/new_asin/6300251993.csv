7807602,3,6300251993,"A little boy named Matthew gleefully runs his dad over with a bulldozer, losing his own hand in the process. For this small infraction he is sent to a mental institution. Years later, an older Mat (Fred Holbert) is released, and goes home to be with his mum. Uh-Oh! Mum's gotten herself married to some new guy! Matthew immediately sets out to slay the interloper with an axe. Chop! Whack! Unfortunately, mum happens by and witnesses Mat's handiwork. Plop! Poor mum takes a spill, cracking her melon on a big ol' rock! Matthew hits the road, hitching a ride with a young newlywed couple. Alas, they remind him of mum and her husband! Mayhem ensues, and continues unabated. The entire film is one senseless murder after another by one of the most reprehensible characters ever conceived! SCREAM BLOODY MURDER is an extremely low-budget creep-fest with just enough story to (almost) justify the non-stop carnage. Would make a great double feature w/ DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT.
