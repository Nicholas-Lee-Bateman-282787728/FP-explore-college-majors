6822112,5,B00PUWG8F4,"This movie combines comedy, drama, and some sort of Christmas fairy tale. A guy gets drunk on Christmas eve and, by mistake, is put on a plane from Moscow to St. Petersburg instead of his (also drunk) friend. As a result of this mishap he misses an important date with his girlfriend where (at last) he intended to propose. Instead, he meets another woman in St. Petersburg (Nadya) who just happened to live on a street with the same name, in the same ""typical"" apartment block, and in the same ""typical"" flat with the same ""typical"" furniture as what the guy had in Moscow. The main part of the story only begins as Nadya discovers a completely drunk stranger sleeping on her sofa... Within the remaining hour and a half of the movie you find out that these two were ment for each other.
Sounds melodramatic? Sure. The trick that makes this movie work is in excellent acting and in the warm atmosphere that may resemble a good drama theater experience. The movie was made in the 70'es. It became an all-time-favorite ""Christmas movie"" in Russia. Often, it is watched year after year around winter holidays. There are a number of songs with excellent lyrics (e.g. by Pasternak and Ahmatova) that add considerably to the appeal of this movie.
I believe that anyone can enjoy the movie even if you don't know Russian (but do not mind subtitles available on this DVD). However, if you don't understand Russian you might be better off ignoring the subtitles for song lyrics as they do not make much sense (they are simply a bad translation).
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!",1416441600,6,1575,4.648745519713262

8689365,4,B00PUWG8F4,You most likely know this film so will not write about it. The English text is good and not difficult to read most times. Text is why I gave it four not five stares.,1481241600,,165,3.8823529411764706
8689366,5,B00PUWG8F4,I was interested in this because it is our own tradition to watch IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or CHRISTMAS STORY around Christmas.  It became a tradition to watch THE IRONY OF FATE in Russia before midnight on New Year's.  Women were sewing their own dresses copied from the film.,1480550400,,274,4.571428571428571

8689370,4,B00PUWG8F4,"This is NOT a Christmas story, it is a New Year's Eve story that is extremely popular in Russia.  The movie was released in 1976 and pokes fun at the fact that the Soviets showed so little imagination in their construction: the same box buildings throughout the county with the same boring names.  Without giving up too much of the plot, through a hilarious series of circumstances our hero ends up in what he thinks is his apartment - it is the correct unit on the correct street, but he is in Leningrad rather than Moscow!  It is a fun story, and if you do not mind subtitles (with various spelling and grammatical errors), it is a fun way to spend some time on New Year's Eve or any other evening.  There are also some great songs in the movie.",1451779200,3,747,4.314285714285714
