Thanks Jeff for sorting out fact from fad!",1433289600,,176,5.103448275862069
8512588,5,B00797HRJY,I knew it was going to take some major convincing for me not to have oils & nuts - and this DVD foot the bill.  It's clear and well explained and simple enough to understand - but you'd have to be interested in the subject to follow it through - which I was !  Jeff Novick leaves no stone unturned in this powerpoint lecture about the nutritional pro's & con's of all the nuts and seeds and oils.  I need to lose weight - so for me - they are a junk food.  But as he says - if you have no weight to lose and you want a small amount in your diet - your choice - but don't eat them like I have been thinking they're super foods at the expense of your girth.,1368921600,10,655,3.7941176470588234
8512589,4,B00797HRJY,"I have most of Jeff Novick's videos and follow his caloric density prescriptions on eating a whole-food, plant-based diet.  He is great at being entertaining while still educating.  Nuts are not necessary in a healthy diet and all the micro nutrients can be found in other low-fat foods; the important thing to remember about nuts is that they do have way too much fat, which will hinder weight loss and maintenance.

The only reason I give this video a 4 and not a 5, is that his presentation is not up to par with his other works.  The subject matter is still important, accurate and backed by Science.

I recommend anyone buy and rewatch Jeff's video and Calorie Density.",1361318400,6,674,4.630252100840337
8512590,5,B00797HRJY,As always Jeff gives a very clear understanding of nutrition related information.  He makes it easy to understand but so hard to understand why so many other people give the wrong information.  Watch this DVD!,1331424000,6,209,4.942857142857143
