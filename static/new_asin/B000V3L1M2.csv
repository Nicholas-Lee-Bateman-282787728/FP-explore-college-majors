2928714,2,B000V3L1M2,"This review is about the work itself, not this particular release. The film is mildly entertaining, if a bit slow in places; particularly towards the end, when I found myself wishing God would just hurry up and nuke the place (preferrably toasting sanctimonius Stewart Granger along with the others). But it has all the makings of a Biblical epic: entertaining plot, fine acting, vivid costumes and sets. And like all good movies of the genre, the evil pagans come off as more attractive and interesting than the dull Hebrews, in their brown sack-cloth and Protestant virtues.
  Of course being the history buff that I am, I had a number of problems with this production, which I just can't help sharing. Abraham and Lot lived in the bronze-age, yet the film obviously takes place in the more advanced iron-age, and late iron-age at that---with all the horses and armor prancing about. I also did not understand why the writers of this film strayed so far from the Bible. I understand artistic lisence and all that, but really guys! Show some respect for your source. Lot was not a great patriarch of a Hebrew tribe: in the original story, he's simply a family man with a few servants in tow. In fact, seeing as Abraham is supposedly the Founding Father of the Hebrews, there could be no ""tribe"" yet. In the Bible, Sodom is indicated as being lush and well-watered, yet the film places it in the middle of an arid wasteland. And the whole anti-slavery schtick: come on! The concepts of freedom and equality are modern, and did not exist in the ancient world. For Heaven's sake, even the Bible lists Jewish laws regarding the ownership and treatment of slaves. I really had a hard time swallowing that one. Overall, though, this movie is not a bad way to kill a Sunday afternoon. If you like Ben-Hur or Ten Commandments, than you will probably enjoy this one as well. Just don't mistake it for Biblical history!",1219017600,53,1910,4.6985074626865675
2928715,2,B000V3L1M2,"I consider this at least a four star movie but the discs only merit two stars. When I read the first review posted here it gave me great hope that this was a decent DVD transfer of  one of my favorite epic movies. Upon viewing it I was sadly disappointed. The only plus factor is that it is widescreen (about 1.85) which other DVDs of this title are not. The single disc version from the Asian company Best Movie Collection has better color and is complete. This two disc set is missing a line here and there which is rather annoying. Even more annoying is that the movie is broken up onto two discs. This wouldn't matter if it had been done correctly and the film broken at the intermission point, but it isn't . It just stops abruptly and picks up again on the second disc. I wish that Fox would give this a legitimate U.S. DVD release  restoring the Overture and Intermission which were not on their VHS tape, but it seems rather unlikely.",1198022400,72,942,4.346590909090909
2928716,4,B000V3L1M2,"This film is a wonderful entry into Biblical adaptation films like Samson and Delilah and The Ten Commandments. Not only is the story strong, the effects good for the time, the acting very good but the name of the God of the Hebrews -- JEHOVAH -- (taken from the Hebrew tetragrammaton YHWH, meaning He causes to become"") is used correctly and quite often. Yet the film never preaches, making the story shine gracefully especially through the strength and quality of actor Stewart Granger as Lot, a man of great conviction, great love and great pain. When he utters the words ""Look long at that Sun, you'll never see it again"" I still feel a shutter work it's way down my spine.
  Though on two DVDs the transfer is very, very good, the color quality is slightly better than that of the VHS and it sounds great too. Good effects for the time, exciting story and dark undertones place it far above other biblical adaptations of that time, forcing one to overlook a few minor flaws in it's history and the set coming with no special features.
  I give it two thumbs way up (Along with a few more if I had the appendages) so enjoy.",1196208000,54,1127,4.482926829268293

2928723,5,B000V3L1M2,"I was a bit hesitant to purchase this D.V.D. because of its foreign origins, but my concerns were unwarranted.  The D.V.D.'s played perfectly.  The aspect ratio seemed to be a bit off as some of the lettering at the beginning appeared cropped.  Other than that the film quality & sound were fine.  There are deviations from biblical scripture & historical accuracy, but that is pretty much the norm when they make movies based on scripture.  All in all this is a very enjoyable movie & a great addition for those who collect Biblical, Historical or Sword & Sandal films.  Fans of Stewart Granger will want to snatch this film up as he delivers a great performance portraying Lot as the leader of a band of Hebrews who decide to settle on the outskirts of the twin cities of Sodom & Gomorrah.  While doing his best to be non violent when forced to fight Lot wields his curved shepherds staff with martial skill! There is some great fight choreography where Lot uses the curved end of his staff to put a key lock on his enemies arm, catches his foe around the neck & spins him around a around until with a twist of his staff sends him sailing through the air as effectively as a Judo throw!  There is a lot of action & while it may not be 100% accurate to scripture it still holds on to the main values of this Bible story.  Scholar's of History or the Bible could pick this movie apart but I am happy to add it to my collection of Biblically based movies.  With todays special effects I would like to see a lot more Biblical movies made for the big screen.  Recently I was asked what I thought about the new  movie version of ""Noah"" & my answer was "" I am happy to see directors brave enough to bring religious movies to the big screen.""  I also told my friend that I realized there were a lot of inaccuracies but thought that was a compromise I was willing to except if it made more young people interested in the Bible & that their parents could tell them the correct story or better yet let the young people read the story themselves from the Bible.  The same goes for this movie.  Even for those not into religion this movie holds its own as a action adventure tale.",1444694400,2,2169,4.320987654320987

2928741,1,B000V3L1M2,"The only thing that was factual in this movie was the narration of Genesis chapter 13 verses 8 thru 13 that was read at the beginning of the movie, and the fact that Lot lived in Sodom.  The rest of the movie was absolutely unbiblical, or what they call gross Artistic license by the writer, director and producer of this movie. What a distortion of biblical facts; in this movie Lot called on God who came to his rescue.  There was no mention of Abrahams involvement, and that is a huge omission of the historical facts.  Also, when Lot was departing from Sodom, he convinced several of the Sodomites to leave with him; where is that in the bible?  The only ones that left with Lot, according to the bible, was his wife and two daughters.

If you only want to be entertained, then this movie will provide it somewhat.  However if you hunger for a closer walk with God, my suggestion is to skip this movie and to watch "" More than Dreams"".

Hollywood always took a lot of license with their way of telling any historical story & this movie is no different. I still like it because it is so hard to find any good old-fashioned Bible stories that you can get teens & pre-teens to watch.

2928754,4,B000V3L1M2,"If the Italian producers of this film wanted to paint a picture of an alluring but corrupt city and ruler, they accomplished that with a lot of style and expense.  Yes, it is not scripturally accurate but then few bible story-based films back in the 1940s through 1960s were because Hollywood and other film meccas felt they could improve on the original stories.  This film adds a lot of background stories that flesh out the famous tale of the fall of the two evil cities of old.  In this film, the dapper Stewart Granger leads his people astray by falling in love for the wrong woman and thinking he and his family are above temptation.  Sadly, he is wrong and there you have the plot as he sees himself and his family pulled into the moral muck and mire that was Sodom and Gomorrah.  It is clear that the end is near and there is no stopping it.  I actually like this film because of the feel and the toned-down sexual overtones and social and moral evils of the people are hinted but not glorified.  It feels naughty but in the safe mode.

On a side note, the tale of the Fall of Sodom and Gomorrah in the film, The Bible is a truer biblical depiction of this tale.",1348358400,2,1170,4.310502283105023

I expected it to be true to Scripture. At least Stewart Granger was a handsome Lot and his salt pillar wife was the correct one - not the supposed one visitors to Israel are shown. Lot had five daughters - one was killed, two were married and lived in Sodom, and two were still virgins. Lot did not marry a Sodomite, he was already married when he and his people arrived at Sodom. It was him, his wife and two virgin daughters that went from Sodom and not a whole bunch of people. His wife did not look back because she was a Sodomite, she looked back because her children and grandchildren were still in Sodom. Go read the Book of Jasher for more information.

I will not view it again.

From the opening scene which focuses on the aftermath of an apparently  exhaustive orgy
to the finale when Lot recovers from the fact that his wife can be taken seriously  as more than a grain of salt,one wonders how so many prominent actors agreed to perform in this silly and santimonious epic.  As a high school sophmore I knew that this film provided just enough sexual suggestion and sadism to assure any of the young Friday night 1962 movie crowd that vice on the big screen was worth the buck and a quarter ticket.  This cinematic spectacle merits far more credit than the infantile ""Sign Of The Gladiator"" which gives the concept of boredom extended dimension.
When you feel the need for mindless entertainment this 1962 Sodom and Gomorrah movie should
serve as an immediate contender.",1323043200,,883,4.827814569536423
2928758,4,B000V3L1M2,"I wish, I wish, I wish there were another way to see this movie than either subscribe to Fox Movie Channel, borrow it from a very quirky friend with an extensive love of classic Biblical cinema, or take the plunge and buy one of the questionable DVDs of it. Ultimately, I'm not sorry I took the plunge. The acting is remarkably atrocious, thanks in large part to the unspeakably awkward dialogue, but the special effects (for the time) are astounding-- especially the sprawling climax and the huge battle midway through the film-- and we daren't forget Miklos Rozsa's wondrous score, although the score does actually stand better on its own than in this camperific clunker. You'll probably hate Stewart Granger (if you don't already). Anouk Aimee runs away with the show, brilliantly campy as the Queen of Sodom (is there any other way to play a character with a title like that?), and Pier Angeli manages to pull off the role of Lot's exotically sensuous yet decidedly noble wife with ease. Never mind that Prosperi and Butler's script transforms the whole fable into a semi-allegorical tale of Felliniesque excess centering on a sanctimonious sheep dandy whose constant references to the strength and glory of Jehovah must make even the most firmly faithful viewers roll their eyes every time he opens his mouth. The story really doesn't make much sense, but it's better than many other similar productions of Old Hollywood-- among them ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" and ""The Silver Chalice."" And despite being even preachier than John Huston's ""The Bible,"" it works twice as well as pure entertainment. The two-disc Castaways DVD is a sad affair, though. The packaging is (I cannot emphasize this strongly enough) hideous, the whole two-and-a-half-hour movie is divided into six individual chapters of about 25 minutes each, and the greatly needed English subtitles (though I'm glad they're there at all) read almost like a bad joke. It is in widescreen (not enhanced for widescreen TVs) but omits the overture, intermission, and (one of the most beautiful and lush pieces of music ever written for film) the exit music. It would be nice to see this movie get a decent DVD release, but it's not worth actually buying another. My advice is, unless you're a huge fan of either the genre or some artistic participant in the movie, like the composer or one of the actors, forgo the experience.",1309132800,3,2393,4.94044665012407

2928761,4,B000V3L1M2,"The author added a lot of detail to the story of Lot and his choosing to go to Sodom because it looked so frutiful compared the barren country his uncle Abraham selected after Lot had chosen the best for himself. The movie shows how quickly Lot lost his commitment to purity and the Law of Moises when he was placed into a worldly situation where the most evil sexual and cruel acts where commonplace. The movie does a good job of showing his gradual decline, his realization of what had happened to him, and how he repented. In his repentance he warns the Sodomites but they only laugh. It was to be their last laugh. This movie is a good choice for Christians who are compromising the standards of Christ and are becoming indistiguishable from the heathen society in which Christians find themselves.

2928762,4,B000V3L1M2,"It's a pretty entertaining movie with all the ingredients of an old `sword and scandal' Biblical epic. The acting is good, the players handsome and the plot is a reasonable interpretation of the Old Testament story. Lot marries a girl who is an ex-Sodomite which explains why she looks back in dismay at the destruction of her old city during the escape into the hills at the end.

Lot and his tribe of Hebrews for a time live in relative peace with the Sodomites because they live separately, across the river and outside the walls of the city. The real trouble begins when Lot accepts an invitation from the Queen for him and his people to live within the walls of Sodom which leads many of the Hebrews (including Lots own daughters) to abandon their former ways in favour of those of their hosts.

Essentially the story pivots about a clash of cultures and values: the Sodomites with their wealth derived from trading in salt, enjoying lives of luxury and self-indulgence supported by a huge throng of personal slaves; and the Hebrews, whose beliefs require them to reject the use of slaves and the follow stricter rules in regard to their relationships.",1295913600,2,1157,4.7227722772277225
