8519624,4,B007N31Y0M,"Marc Verillote presents hundreds of ""techniques"" in this DVD (also in volumen 2), and they are okay to watch as long as you have patience and are willing to ""dig"" for tips that may be useful to your game.

The main problem with this DVD is that every little variation becomes ""a technique"" and each of these is numbered, i.e., doesn't have a descriptive name. This seems to be common, the Gracies go mostly by number and they also count every little twitch as a technique, and that too is one of my objections with their combatives and master cycles.

There is no explanation of subjacent principles and just a rough division or grouping of the techniques. So you have to observe and inferr it yourself (I guess Kano did this sort of thing when studying Jujitsu, but he DID come up with all pervading underlying principles, e.g., maximum efficient use of physical and mental strength and mutual welfare).

You don't see a teacher here but a performer. I like it, I certainly don't love it.",1386806400,3,989,4.607954545454546
