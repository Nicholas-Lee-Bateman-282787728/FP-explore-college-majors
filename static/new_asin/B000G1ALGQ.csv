2597427,3,B000G1ALGQ,"If you are after traditional G&S, you've definitely come to the wrong place. This version is fun, frothy and silly, extensively ""modernised"", with little bits added and with electronic music. This production, with Jon English (Pirate King) and Simon Gallaher, first opened in Sydney in 1984 - just a fabulous night out - and personally I preferred it to what it had evolved to ten or so years later (the 1984 version launched the unknown Marina Prior, had a larger chorus of far more ""normal"" sisters, featured David Atkins as a sparklingly energetic and very tiny Sargeant, and June Bronhill - a real opera singer - as a delightful Ruth).

It's inevitable that some parts will not please everyone. Some changes enhance it, some seem like change for the sake of change... after all there ARE good reasons this show from the 1870s is still so loved! For example, I love the energy, enthusiasm and dancing ability of anything involving the Pirates and the men's chorus. On the other hand I can't stand the not-so-Fabulous-Singlettes, three singers who play ""the ladies chorus"" - if I was Frederic faced with a choice of marrying Ruth or going for the ""sweet young things"" then one of the most beautiful yearning tenor solos in the G&S lexicon would never have been written.

The strength of this production revolves around Frederic and the Pirate King (and that men's chorus!).

Simon Gallaher (Frederic) who I believe mounted this production (?) is a lovely Frederic - sings like an angel, looks young and innocent - just delightful. He plays the role ""straight"", and it works.

I really enjoy the performance of Jon English as the Pirate King. English (a former 70s rock star) has an awesome presence, helped by being extremely tall. He plays the King as a bit of a thick, a combination of lovable and scary but definitely dumb! - and very funny (although this probably worked better on stage!).

Helen Donaldson as Mabel is lovely - and also played ""straight"".

Major General - not the best choice - too young (looks like the younger brother of the Fabulous Singlettes), too stupid, too comic. The ORIGINAL is funny enough.

So - to buy it or not? It depends what you are after! My kids are enjoying it (as I speak!) as an intro to G&S, and it's great for that. Those looking for a new approach will find plenty to enjoy, although you may find (like me) that the ""price"" of the energy and new approach is needing to forgive some stuff!!! Purists will probably find that it is too much.

I DO wish they'd recorded it ten years earlier before it went too far...

There's another production currently running in Australia, from Opera Australia. I expect this will become available in the next six months (it's already been on TV) and I look forward to getting that one. Personally I prefer it, and I have to say the singing is MUCH, MUCH better.",1168732800,7,2843,4.67
2597428,1,B000G1ALGQ,"This production was abysmal. I turned it off after watching the miserably feeble attempt of enhancing the Major General's song by adding a pathetic string of rhyming words after the last stanza, as if Sir Gilbert's libretto needed any improvement. Pirates has been popularized for modern audiences many times, most notably, the well done 1980's production starring Linda Ronstadt, but this version is hard to bear. The Major General's daughters look like they stepped off the set of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and the Pirate King seems unsuited to his role despite his histrionic posturing. On the whole, the production is ham-handed, campy and sure to disturb the eternal rest of those venerable gentlemen whose brilliance of wit and musical genius gave it birth.",1161043200,9,767,5.144
2597429,3,B000G1ALGQ,"This version of ""Pirates"" is worth the viewing if only to hear the tenor; fantastic control and amazing voice.

Most of the play is tossed away carelessly as the principles (Pirate King and & the Major General) never take what they are doing seriously and we are constantly aware that they are aware they are doing a play and are trying ever-so-hard to be funny.

The 3 Singlets, cast as the (""8, or 9, or 10 in all"") General's daughters are talented singers, but their singing doesn't make up for the fact that they look more as if they should have been cast as Ruth(s) AND they chew (read devour) the scenery whenever they're on stage.  Oh.  Did I mention that for some inexplicable reason they found it necessary to add a rock n' roll beat to many of the songs?

Imagine ""Pirates of Penzance"" done almost completely for Burlesque and you get the overall impression.  If one principle character was overplayed, it might have been cute - this many hammy over-the-top actors and it's just too much.  The Pirate King is especially appealing and would have added a certain cache if some of the others had been restrained; notably the Major General who let no sight gag or mugging opportunity slip past him - even those that destroyed character, pace, and plot.

The less said about Ruth, the better. I suspect she is an Australian celebrity; I can't think she was chosen for her acting or singing.  The Police Sergeant is a skilled contortionist.

HOWEVER - the saving grace of the piece are Frederick and Mabel.  They are just too darn good to miss.

The scenes where the Singlets are restrained, where the Major General is GONE, or the Pirates are on alone work well.

If you are prepared for a bit of a roller-coaster ride, this show is worth watching.  Just be prepared with the 'mute' or 'fast forward'.",1158796800,9,1806,4.585669781931464
2597430,1,B000G1ALGQ,"I bought this DVD having purchased the Australian Opera DVD of Patience, which I found to be excellent.  This version of Pirates is simply AWFUL; it is a parody on Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta, having almost nothing to do with the original work.  The so-called music has been entirely rescored, and is abominably bad; the acting is hammed-up slapstick; the dialogue has been greatly modified, and in many spots, Gilbert's text completely disappears. Some of the cast appear to be moderately decent singers; unfortunately, their talents are not allowed to shine in this version.

I cannot recommend this DVD to anyone who is a lover of Gilbert and Sullivan.",1157673600,11,659,5.027522935779817
2597431,3,B000G1ALGQ,"If you are expecting a performance by the same production company that performed the Australian Opera/Opera Australia ""Gondoliers"", ""Patience"", ""Mikado"", and ""Pinafore"" this will disappoint.  Taken on its own merits, I think it's hilarious in a Buster Keaton kind of way but others disagree.  It's certainly not a great (or even particularly good) performance from a musical viewpoint, and the stage is incredibly small but there's a comedic energy to it that compensates for quite a lot.

Opera Australia is performing ""Pirates of Penzance"" for the 2006/2007 season so I would expect a DVD of the new production around the middle of 2007.",1156291200,5,639,5.184466019417476
2597432,4,B000G1ALGQ,"You can tell from the overture that this will not be Pirates as written. Yes, most of the material is there, but it is re-orchestrated for synthesizer etc. And the cast appears to be VIPs from Austrailia's theater world rather than G&S singers. Rather like the Ronstat Kline US production.  Most are amplified and that is at times distracting. Now if you can accept this you are in for a genuine delight. These folks are wonderful entertainers and the schticks flow fast and free. Not that the original is slighted. Look at it as a way to bring G&S up to date. Accept Australia's premise and prepare to be swept up in inspired lunacy.",1155340800,35,634,4.56140350877193

2597452,5,B000G1ALGQ,"This is not the traditional ""Pirates"", it's true. It's a descendant in spirit of Papp's 1980 New York production, and takes some of the same modern liberties while still standing on its own. So be prepared for a more openly comedic take, and one which breaks the fourth wall early and often. This recording was made well into the production's run, too, so the audience is both aware of what's up and willing to be played to and feed the show's energy.

Jon English's Pirate King is, of course, reminiscent of Kevin Kline's; he's swarthy, smarmy, over-the-top and completely unselfconscious throughout the show. Toni Lamond's Ruth is played similarly, and a fine complement to English in all of their shared scenes.

Helen Donaldson's Mabel is more low-key, but willing to have fun with her material when appropriate (especially the coloratura on ""Poor Wand'ring One"" and in the ensemble conclusion of ""When the Foeman Bares His Steel"") while toning it down for the more ""serious"" numbers. Simon Gallaher's Frederic similarly is played mostly straight, though again has some openly hammy moments (notably at the end of ""Oh, Is There Not One Maiden Breast""). Donaldson and Gallaher also are the strongest voices by far, and have solid enough chemistry to occasionally make the viewer forget they're in a comedy.

Derek Metzger as General Stanley holds up well, though his makeup could be more convincing. Tim Tyler's sergeant of police is clearly taking slapstick cues from Tony Azito, but that's not a bad thing, and Tyler's mannerisms and voice are distinct enough to establish this as his own adaptation of the role. And the condensed Edith/Kate/Isabel roles (credited as ""The Fabulous Singlettes"") bring just the right touch of camp to each of their appearances.

The show does run a bit long to accommodate the various gags, including a stupendous number of audience-encouraged encores on ""With Cat-Like Tread"", but despite that it never feels as if it's dragging. The energy is relentless, from the somersaulting pirates at the opening of Act I straight through to the stepped-up ""mega-mix"" medley that runs during the credits.

Ultimately, though, your reaction to Gallaher's adaptation will come from your own expectations of what ""Pirates"" ought to be. If you're looking for a more staid and polished production in the tradition of D'Oyly Carte, you'll probably be best off staying away. But if you're open to quite a bit more comedy in your comic opera, you'll find plenty of entertainment here.",1343779200,,2503,5.065533980582524
2597453,4,B000G1ALGQ,"This DVD is a video of a live stage performance of Pirates of Penzance. There is clearly an audience present, and although the camera work is good, there remains a lot of stage ambiance that sometimes distracts.

The main reason that I recommend this DVD is for the performance of the two romantic leads, Simon Gallaher as Frederic and Helen Donaldson as Mabel. I don't think you will find a better set if pipes and appropriate singing styles in any other DVD version of this operetta. Simon looks the part and has a fine bel canto voice that perfectly suits the part, and Donaldson not only looks lovely but sings the part with the voice of a goddess. Their acting also holds up just fine.

My main reservation is with Jon English as the Pirate King. Physically, and in terms of costume, he looks the part, with the exception of a mullet haircut and Steve Tyler swagger that constantly makes one think of an aging rock star who wandered onto the stage. English basically performs the part well enough, picking up many bits from Kevin Kline's famous Papp production performances, and while his singing voice in not as good as anyone else's, and not as good as Kline's it is serviceable. And he is a gifted physical comedian, performing many falls, including down stairs, that are funny indeed. He does sometimes act as though the story is about his character, and this might be the fault of the director.

The actor playing Major General Stanley plays the part well, but looks totally wrong, more like a skinny teenager who glued on a set of muttonchops.

The roles of the police men are all well handled and funny, although the police captain's singing voice is a bit weak.

The biggest change is that if Mabel's sisters. Here they are played by a trio of women who are billed only by a group name, ""The Singlettes"" as I recall, as if they were an imported singing/comedy act, and maybe that's what they are. They don't look the part, with inappropriate costumes and hair styles, and they seem to be channeling Cinderella's three wicked sisters. But they ARE a scream comedically, and they sing all the sisters' lines in three part harmony that, while not original to B&S, does fit and seems appropriate, and they sing very well. My major beef with them is that their roles, especially during ""Oh, Is there not one maiden breast"", are elevated to the point where they are a distraction from the song.

So, a worthy Pirates, and worth having, but not without its flaws.

As with the Papp production that is so widely used as a model for modern performances of Pirates, liberties are taken with the lyrics and score here and there.",1341878400,,2630,4.618843683083512

2597459,4,B000G1ALGQ,"I am convinced that there's a certain type of Gilbert & Sullivan aficionado who can't enjoy G&S unless they can feel like it makes them special. This type of fan cherishes a closely-held belief that Gilbert & Sullivan are highbrow entertainment and always have been, that enjoying G&S is the province of the sophisticated few, and if just *anyone* could enjoy G&S -- if it were no longer an exclusive club -- it would somehow diminish their own personal enjoyment. For if the wrong kind of person could like Gilbert & Sullivan, then liking Gilbert & Sullivan no longer automatically makes one the RIGHT kind of person, and then where would we be? Chaos and anarchy, that's where.

I would thumb my nose at this type of Gilbert and Sullivan aficionado, but Jon English, Simon Gallaher, and the rest of the insanely talented crew of this production already did it. Their ""Pirates"" is a gloriously chaotic, unabashedly playful thing. It plays fast and loose with the score, dialogue and casting, but for those more concerned with spirited entertainment than museum-quality propriety, it's completely worth it. The result of their inspired goofing has a legitimate claim as the spiritual descendant of original Gilbert & Sullivan theatre, which was never highbrow, often broad and slapsticky, full of jabs at the current events of the time and always populist entertainment.

The nature of comedy has changed in the past 150 years. I have the D'Oyly Carte performance of this operetta on CD and the singing and orchestra are absolutely gorgeous, but the dialogue isn't funny. Which is to say, the lines as written are funny, yes, but they're not delivered in the way a modern comedian would deliver them. In order to be true comedy -- comedy that provokes gut chortling as opposed to the kind of ""comedy"" where audiences laugh dutifully wherever they already know it's meant to be funny -- some things must change. Now, Gallaher's production contains a lot of changes and I don't mean to suggest that all or even most of them are necessary, just that stuffy traditionalists may want to consider loosening their clutch on strict formal operetta as the only right way to perform Gilbert and Sullivan.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because to me the one area where changes lowered the quality of the production was the synthesized score. I'm not opposed to synthesizers per se, but this one is pretty cheesy and not well anchored to the live orchestra parts of the music.

Everyone who loves Pirates owes it to themselves to watch a really good operatic-style production of it, and also to watch this. Children particularly love it.",1308787200,,2627,4.857142857142857

There are good things in it, Frederic (Simon Gallagher) and Mabel (Helen Donaldson) are both very well portrayed, and their singing is excellent.

After that there is only a string of disheartening performances.

The Pirate King (Jon English) engages (OFTEN, or is it ORFEN?) in well-rehearsed ""improvisations"" that I did not appreciate at all.  General Stanley's daughters (""The Fabulous Singlettes"") come out carrying microphones and singing in a style suited to an audition for American Idol, not Gilbert and Sullivan.  Then they lit up cigarettes (filtered). Their performance was dismal.

There is no opening overture, and after the curtain calls, the cast engages in a ""pop-rock/disco sing along"" with the audience.  The audience there enjoyed it, but I think I would have walked out.

The operetta is already really funny, and I found the incessant improvisations either tasteless, or boring.  I am sending this dvd back, and hope for a full refund.

I couldn't believe my luck when I found that I could buy the DVD on Amazon, and sent off for it straight away. There isn't anyone in the cast, including the musicians, who doesn't give a 100% fantastic performance. The music and singing are wonderful and the performance is outstanding; I thoroughly recommend this to G & S novices and afficianado's alike, and guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",1264464000,3,631,4.851851851851852
2597467,1,B000G1ALGQ,"I'm all for updating Gilbert & Sullivan's operettas for modern audiences.  But if you care a whit for Arthur Sullivan's music, this ""Pirates"" is a travesty.

The melodies may be Sullivan's, but the orchestra for which he wrote is gone -- replaced by a second-rate synthetic-keyboard score.  Though Arthur Sullivan wrote his best-known compositions for the comic opera, he wanted his music to be taken seriously.  This ""Pirates"" offers a pathetic electronic score that can ill be taken as anything but an insult not only to Mr. Sullivan and his compositional art, but to the listener as well.

I've got nothing against modern revisions of Gilbert & Sullivan's greatest works.  W.S. Gilbert's witty jabs at the politicians and cultural icons of his own day can can easily be lost on modern audiences.  Thus renewed lyrics, taking fresh jabs today's celebrities and politicians may keep satirical ditties -- such as Ko-Ko's ""little list"" in ""The Mikado"" -- as relevant and alive to modern ears as W.S. Gilbert's original text was to the Victorian Britons for whom he wrote.  Jonathan Miller's notion of casting casting Eric Idle as Lord High Executioner, and dressing the characters -- including the Mikado and his court -- in the a cartoonish garb of inspired by 1920s Chicago gangsters seems rather bizarre at first -- but it works.

2597468,5,B000G1ALGQ,"I am a huge Musical Theater fan and ever since seeing Pirates of Penzance for the first time back when I was a freshman in high school, I have loved it ever since. The version I saw in HS followed the original pretty well, with a few minor adjustments here and there, so I made sure to a proffesional version of it later on. Now this particular Pirtes does not follow the original play as well as some might want it to, but I found it to be an utter joy.

I discovered this Australian cast version while searching the many videos on youtube for songs from Pirates and was absolutely taken with the entertainment/hilarity of this version. Sure it isn't the proper G&S version of Pirates, I believe it's a bit of a parody, but I love it!!! This version seems like it was made for the sake of entertainment, so just enjoy it! Sure some of the dialogue has changed and a lot of the music has been modernized with a bit of a Rock feel to it and the characters may be a bit over the top at times, it's funny and meant to be laughed at and enjoyed!

For those looking for a more traditional rendition of Pirates, I would suggest the Australian Opera version. Though not at funny or entertaining as this one, Its the beloved version of Pirates most of us know and love. So I suggest this to anyone looking for a bit of fun, hilarity, slight stupidity and all around entertainment. Just make sure you aren't TOO critical about it, otherwise you'll spend the entire prformance pointing out what: is wrong or doesn't follow the original, and you won't be able to just enjoy it for what it is.",1249084800,4,1581,4.31986531986532
2597469,3,B000G1ALGQ,"We really do enjoy watching this DVD, but I have to say at my first viewing it struck me as a very bad joke.  Once the initial shock had worn off I really began to enjoy it, most of it that is.  The main reason I'm writing this review is to object to the performance of General Stanley.  This character makes me angry every time we see it. This goof is trying so hard to be funny it's embarassing to watch.  Thank God his parts can be fast forwarded.  Otherwise the production is fun, providing you accept the fact that it really is a parody of one of G&S's best.",1230076800,,563,4.081818181818182
2597470,5,B000G1ALGQ,"Yes, at some time or another in this production, every cast member does some mugging for the audience.  Some more than others.  Some of it is down right shameless.  The thing is, I saw a portion of this on the ARTS cable network before I bought it and read the reviews here so I had an idea what I was getting.  I got exactly what I expected.  This DVD gives you excellent performers (maybe not great actors) but fantastic performers.  The biggest ham is John English as the pirate king.  His interplay with the conductor is terrific and as other reviewers have stated, he is not taking his role seriously.  If however, you watch the performance it is obvious that every move has been rehearsed over and over and that all these spontaneous acts come off flawlessly.  Derek Metzger as the major-general was a bit annoying with his extra antics, but I could live with that.  Tim Tyler as the sergeant did a nice job but I especailly enjoyed his bit with (I think they were ping-pong balls)after his first entrance.  Simon Gallaher as Frederic was great and Helen Donaldson was the first Maybel I've ever seen that actually seemed to have a personality.  Most Maybels are just there looking cute and singing.  She actually used expressions starting with her first entrance:  Yes it's Maaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy Bel!  Then she got in to the part with the marching song.  Hmmm..Good acting and a nice voice. Nice concept.  I also would be neglectful if I did not mention the 3 daughters of the Major-General.  They indeed tend to chew up the scenery when they were on, but those ladies had some talent!!! This DVD provided exactly what I expected and what I hoped for when I ordered it.  This is just 115 minutes of fun.  Even the opening overture starts out with the cast having fun with Gilbert and Sullivan.  I've read that G & S purists might not like this production.  I don't know what a G & S purist is.  I love Gilbert and Sullivan and this version did not offend me at all.  Maybe I'm not a purist.  If you're not a 'purist', don't miss this version of Pirates of Penzance.  If you enjoy it once, you will want to watch it again...and again...and again...and...well, you get it.  This is an easy DVD to recommend.",1227744000,4,2213,4.536708860759494
2597471,5,B000G1ALGQ,"This Australian production of ""The Pirates of Penzance"" is totally hilarious.  I would only recommend it to those who are not G&S purists.  I'm sure that Gilbert would be rolling in his grave if he were to see it.  However, I'm always happy to have fun with ""camped up"" versions of G&S productions as well as those true to the original production.

Jon English makes an unforgettable and totally hilarious Pirate King.  Simon Gallaher, (Frederick), as well as Helen Donaldson make a beautiful couple.  The entire cast and orchestra are outstanding.

I highly recommend it!!

2597472,5,B000G1ALGQ,"I first saw this production on Sky and was thrilled to get the D.V.D. from Amazon. Gilbert and Sullivan purists may hate this interpretation but in my opinion operetta is meant to be light hearted fun, and I think G & S would approve. When I want serious I view grand opera at Covent Garden.
The singing and acting were superb and the comedy sketches hillarious without being farcical.
Jon English, well what can I say? Totally brilliant!
More uplifting than Prozac, more fun than a night out with the girls, my perfect stay at home feel good D.V.D",1192492800,6,548,4.545454545454546
2597473,4,B000G1ALGQ,"If you are a G & S afficionado, you may find this version beyond the pale.

If on the other hand you enjoy the music and humour of these comic operas and are prepared to accept that this company seem more interested in sharing a good time with the audience, than following the script, then this is for you.

Simon Gallaher's production romps through to the finish and everyone on stage seems to be having the time of their life.

True, there are a number of liberties taken with the libretto and even, with  some of the characters. But the entire cast have superb voices with the possible exception of Jon English, whose voice may not have the quality of some of the others but is used to its best advantage and is perfect for the part of the Pirate King. Jon English leads the cast with obvious enjoyment and his asides and jibes at the orchestra pit are a joy.

The lack of an orchestra, it being replaced by synthesisers and percussion, did nothing to reduce and in my opinion, occasionally increased the listener's pleasure.

This is one of three productions from this company and is, to me, the best. It is upbeat and this antipodean angle on the original is a pleasure to behold.

I recommend this to music lovers and lovers of comic opera, but not to those who want their G & S exactly as, originally, written.",1170720000,4,1317,4.439834024896266

This is the same story, same script mostly. Much much more personality than the Kevin Klein / Angela Landsbury version. A few more songs. SO much fun! It's a live recording of a performance in Australia. It will have you laughing all the way through. I've seen this version at least 20 times and loved it each time. I wish I could find it again.

8128404,5,B000G1ALGQ,"while the Kevin Klein version is near & dear to my heart, this version tickles my funny bone & is a delightful faster paced version in which hilarity ensues. The actors are less operatic stars than entertainers, but we've watched this as a family over 10 times & are always finding something new going on that we hadn't noticed before. To our surprise there are songs from Ruddigore thrown in, but placed in such a way that the result is brilliant !
Yes, Ruth's character is more campy barmaid than true singer. Yes, the Pirate king is an older gravely voiced rock star. Yes, Mabel's sisters are tarts that are ridiculous in the extreme. It very well may be that Mabel is the only actual opera singer in the bunch, though Frederick gives a swoon worthy performance ( much like Rex Smith in the Kevin Kline version). The music is electronic instead of a true orchestra & there are liberties taken with the tempo & lyrics.
But, it is a fresh take & really a good bit of fun for those for whom this operetta has gotten to be so well known that you don't mind a bit of spice.
Just watching the pirates dance in the beginning is a key to the heavy dose of vigor that is infused into this version.
Obviously not for G & S purists !",1497916800,,1225,4.307359307359308

We were happy to get the show on VHS before we moved away.  I'm so pleased to see this on DVD and it's definitely going to be a surprise Christmas gift for some of my family this year.

All the singing is terrific and there's a lot of silliness and slapstick.  I love all the main characters, but I think Frederic has the best voice and the pirate king/head policeman are the most fun.  I also think the cameramen did a good job capturing the scenes and side-gags going on, and the quality looks fine to me given how old it is.  Having the live theater experience on DVD  with the audience interaction is really neat as opposed to a movie which lacks that, and personally it takes me back to when I saw the show.

Given the modernization of this show, you could argue that a few small bits of this are PG.  Overall I'd say it's great family fun.",1445817600,,998,4.151041666666667
