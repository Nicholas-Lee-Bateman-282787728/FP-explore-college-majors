6363918,4,B00JJSDPBA,Good if you are used to working out.,1411171200,,36,3.625
6363919,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I tried out this DVD recently and was quite impressed. I do think that it is the most advanced prenatal workout I have tried (I also have Suzanne Bowen's Prenatal Barre and her Long and Lean Prenatal, The Perfect Pregnancy Workout volume 1, 10 Min. Solutions Prenatal Pilates, and several prenatal yoga workouts). I have been doing the DVD in its entirety, but I think the DVD could also be appropriate for someone without a great fitness base by using lighter weights, and only doing a section or 2 at a time. Leah does include suggestions for how to use the DVD based on varying fitness levels.
Several things to keep in mind about this DVD:
The music is very upbeat. I think it's great.
Although there are a couple sections of the workout which incorporate some cardio, this is definitely more of a toning workout. This can be good or bad depending on what you want in a workout DVD. However, I am only in my 2nd trimester, so I may find that what I now consider just a small amount of cardio is plenty later in my pregnancy.
The core/abs section is amazing! This is the only DVD I've found that has devotes a considerable amount of time to the abs, and all the exercises have been modified for use during pregnancy.
This workout devotes little if any time to isolated pelvic floor exercises. If you're wanting a DVD that devotes more time to that, try volume 1 of The Perfect Pregnancy Workout or Suzanne Bowen's Slim and Toned Prenatal Barre. However, there are many compound exercises that do necessitate engaging the pelvic floor and core to perform the moves optimally.
I also found the stretching section to be unique and very well done. Many of the stretches are ones that I had never seen or done before and felt great!
Similarly, many of her toning moves I had never seen or done before. I feel like I am working my muscles in novel ways and although I'm not necessarily getting stronger during pregnancy, I feel more well balanced muscularly.
The only negative I have found in the DVD is that there are several times when Leah will say you have, for example, 8 reps left in an exercise and you actually end up doing a slightly different number. If you are someone who always needs an accurate rep count given, this may drive you crazy. I found that it doesn't bother me at all anymore--when she calls out the reps left, I just use that as a guide to know that we're almost done.
I highly recommend this DVD!",1408665600,59,2420,4.47737556561086
6363920,5,B00JJSDPBA,"Really great dvd, I like layout of this dvd (15 minute segements), every workout she does is smooth and efficient, her voice is totally soothing, and I like the music she has chosen.  the stretching portion is super helpful, especially for the hips and lower back.
It's the most effective workout I have tried so far during my pregnancy.",1399593600,9,337,4.711864406779661
6363921,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I agree with the other reviews. I am not pregnant but I am very impressed with this dvd. This is no joke! If you are looking for a great prenatal workout this is it! I love how Leah packs a lot into each 15 minutes. Don't be intimidated though, you can always start out with just 15 minutes and then progress.  The set is lovely, good music and Leah is absolutely glowing!

6363922,5,B00JJSDPBA,"i love all that leah does and this one did not disappoint.  i am not pregnant, but still found it to be a great workout.  it is broken down into 15 minute segments and she provides guidelines on how to use it based on your fitness level.  wish this one was around when i was pregnant.",1398902400,,284,4.035714285714286
6363923,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I've been working out with Leah Sarago for a couple of years.  I've done her Ballet Body downloads and DVDs as well as her older Ruah series.  I'm not pregnant now, nor have I ever been pregnant (although I hope to be someday soon).  I bought this DVD because I love all of Leah's work and wanted a DVD to have for when I do decide to start a family.  Leah is a certified prenatal specialist and has a degree in exercise science, so I trust Leah's opinion and judgment on what moves and exercises would be safe, yet effective, for an expectant mom.  Pregnancy aside, what also appealed to me about the DVD was the fact that it is divided into 15-minute segments.  This makes the DVD so versatile for when you're short on time or want to mix-and-match your workouts!

Now, on to the DVD itself.  The DVD is divided into two segments for the Upper Body, two for the Lower Body, one for Core, and one for stretching.

The first Upper Body segment combines low-impact cardio with weighted strength moves for the arms.  This cardio was gentle, but did get my heart rate up, especially by the end.  I think it would be perfect for pregnant ladies.  The strength moves were great.  There weren't too many reps, but I certainly felt challenged with a heavy weight (I think I used 8 lbs).  The second Upper Body segment is mat work.  There were several side plank and other mat moves, which I think are great for the arms, but also the core.  This segment was not as challenging as Leah's matwork on her DVDs or downloads, but again I think this is designed for a woman carrying extra weight around her middle, so it seems appropriate.

The lower body segments were structured similarly.  There is a segment that contains lower body strength moves combined with cardio drills.  And then there is a barre-focused lower body segment that really targets the glutes.

The core segment is top-notch, especially because the moves that Leah selected are safe for pregnant women to do while pregnant.  She works the transverse abs and the obliques, but doesn't do any crunch-type moves at all.

The stretching segment is GLORIOUS.  There are several hip-opening stretches which felt wonderful, pregnant or not.  She also holds the stretches for the ""perfect"" amount of time, in my opinion.",1398902400,,2272,4.6225
6363924,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I have tried all the popular Prenatal DVDs and this to me is the best! It's great to be able to just do one 15 minute if short on time. Love the stretch segment cause Leah throws in a couple extra stretches that I have never done before. The setting, music and Leah's happy attitude adds to me enjoying this workout! Not to mention the hardest that I have also tried, which is great because being pregnant does not mean that you cannot still be challenged!",1398902400,2,456,4.313953488372093
6363955,5,B00JJSDPBA,I only got to use it once before I had a miscarriage (not related) but it was a great workout. Definitely sore afterwards and I've been doing jillian Michaels workouts and running before.,1513728000,,187,4.696969696969697
6363956,2,B00JJSDPBA,After the first workout I felt very discouraged. This workout is definitely better suited for those who consider their fitness level intermediate to advanced. Instructor moves very quickly from move to move with little explanation. She offers no modifications for the moves. I felt like I could've easily injured myself! Do not recommend unless you're already super fit to begin with! I think the stretching routine is the only segment I'll be able to get use of. Very disappointed.,1510099200,,482,5.113924050632911
6363957,5,B00JJSDPBA,"Prior to my becoming pregnant i was an avid runner (3+ miles, to 7 days per week) and did a full body workout with a personal trainer weekly, as well as a daily workout asst home. I purchased this you maintain my physical fitness and activity levels safely while expecting. I became very ill (hypermesis gravidarum) and had to quit working out all together. I've recently begun to feel better so I've been slowly implementing a warm up and daily workout. I really can tell I've been slacking, but, feel this is working me back into my normal, with safe techniques that are surprisingly very comfortable even with my ever-growing baby bump (5th child). I also appreciate the pace, as I am extremely fast -paced, but the instructor keeps me in check with her pace and range of motion. All in all, I recommend this for anyone who is moderately to regularly active pre-pregmancy, who is looking to maintain fitness and activity levels. It works you out just enough to ensure you're toning, but not so over the top that you're exhausted. As you progress, adding an additional segment will adjust to meet your needs. The warmup also feels great in the hip and thigh area.",1507766400,2,1165,4.660194174757281
6363958,4,B00JJSDPBA,"Good workout. It's definitely tough but not too difficult. My main complaint is that she does a lot of oblique work and my physical therapist said pregnant women should not to sit ups, cross motion abs or too many obliques because that's what causes your abs to pull too far apart. Some of it was kind of difficult to do as well.  I now avoid a couple of segments. The upper and lower cardio segments are good. I think I did barre once and it was good. Really enjoy the stretching segment at the end.",1505952000,,500,4.2631578947368425
6363959,1,B00JJSDPBA,The video doesn't play.,1503964800,,23,5.0
6363960,5,B00JJSDPBA,I love this workout. I usually do Jillian Michaels and I still do her workouts modified due to being pregnant. If your into a challenging workout and your pregnant but can't deal with the easy pregnancy DVDs then this is a good one. You feel like you worked out and get a little sore afterwards. They are multiple 15 minute segments that you can mix and match for your workout. I recommend to put on your routine.,1503532800,3,413,4.376623376623376
6363961,3,B00JJSDPBA,"As much as I wanted to be one of those ""fit""  pregnant ladies, I soon found out after the first work out that it just wasn't meant to be.  (sad face) I was expecting more of aerobic exercise, but this was more toning and bending, weight lifting.  It wasn't hard per say, but I sarted in my 3rd trimester and I think I would have been ok if I started from the beginning.  I came away just feeling inadequate, because the lady in the video was pretty pregnant and doing it all without being out of breath or breaking a sweat!",1502668800,,523,4.148514851485149
6363962,5,B00JJSDPBA,Love this dvd. Totally kicks our butts (my 10 year old mini joins me ) But is completely doable with it's 15 minute segments!,1501977600,,125,4.25
6363963,5,B00JJSDPBA,"Good workout, I was surprised when it was more intense than what I was doing before. I just make sure I'm not overdoing it but it was just what I need to stay fit during pregnancy. It's super easy to take 15 minutes out of your day",1498176000,,231,3.9361702127659575
6363964,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I'm not pregnant (58 y.o.!), but bought this because I figured if it is safe for a pregnant woman, it must be also for an older/senior one too.  It is a great workout, with fantastic music, and I couldn't be happier.  It is just right for a mature adult who wants a great weighted workout at a slower pace, but still challenging.  Each segment is 15 min, hence you can do 1 or 2 or 3, etc.  I highly recommend this DVD to mature / senior ladies!",1497657600,4,445,4.080459770114943
6363975,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I have been using this DVD for a little over a month now and I am 26 weeks pregnant.  It has been a great way for me to get daily exercise while pregnant.  The prenatal core segment is my least favorite because I have the most difficulty with it.  I have to modify the amount of reps during this segment.  Also, whenever I have to do a reverse plank I struggle.  This is a difficult position for me- I think this is due to poor shoulder mobility on my part in addition to being a little overweight.  I do three segments each day (45 minutes) as well as walk 3-5 times a week.",1497312000,,575,4.04424778761062
6363976,5,B00JJSDPBA,So good! I bought this based off other reviews and I am so happy that I did! I think I might be in better shape now than before I was pregnant!,1496880000,,143,3.6451612903225805
6363977,5,B00JJSDPBA,Challenging yet attainable workouts. Love the three different workout schedules she has printed based on your pre-pregnancy fitness. I started with Level 1 for a couple of weeks at 23 weeks pregnant and feel like I can move up to Level 2 soon. Instructor gives clear instructions without all the annoying fake cheerleading. You can tell some moves are challenging for her too which makes it easier to push yourself. Highly recommend.,1496707200,,433,5.027777777777778
6363978,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I love that this DVD actually comes with a schedule. If you want to work out 5-6 days a week, you can do that with this DVD. Other pregnancy DVDs I have are only intended to be used every other day, which makes it hard to build a complete workout schedule. This DVD is also newer, so the background music and set are pretty good. Plus, I like that this DVD doesn't involve any weird rigging of furniture items or anything like that - you'll be fine with hand weights and a chair. Finally, the workouts are good! Highly recommend.",1495843200,,529,4.3
6363979,5,B00JJSDPBA,"Love this video, she knows her stuff! Especially impressed by stretching segment she has some great stretches for low back, hip flexor and buttocks that do wonders for pregnancy! Each segment is 15 min long so it's convenient and attainable for the tired pregnant women.  Helps give you the sense of accomplishment in a short amount of time!",1495324800,,341,4.879310344827586
6363980,5,B00JJSDPBA,Love the upbeat music and mood. The instructor keeps you going and pushes you. You can tell it is tough for her too and I appreciate that. Always feel the burn with this one. Only downside is I can't do some of the moves she does,1494201600,,229,4.0
6363981,4,B00JJSDPBA,"I bought this with the idea I liked that it came with a workout plan for beginners (people who didn't work out) and a more advance (people who work out for 3 or more days a week).  I did Pilates 3 days a week and walked on weekends.  I choose to do the beginners workout plan because they were shorter workout times and I had no idea what to expect on the video.  I have been fighting fatigue and headaches and didn't want the pressure of doing 45+ minutes.  I started with the first 15 minute segment.  While doing the first segment that was recommended, I thought to myself what the heck did i buy.  It was a quicker pace than what I'm use to in Pilates.  After completing the 15 minutes I ended up watching the other workouts to see if this was going to work out for me.  I'm very happy i watch all the other ones.  I think I will enjoy this workout more and depending on how I feel I might select a different workout.  I am also looking forward to doing the weighted workouts.",1493769600,,980,4.137566137566138

6363983,1,B00JJSDPBA,Still difficult for beginners,1491264000,,29,6.5
6363984,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I love this DVD; the segments are all 15 minutes long, which gives a lot of flexibility for doing one, two or several segments.  This is my first time doing a workout DVD with Leah Sarago; her style is a coach with clear instructions, but not a cheerleader (which is my preference).  Music is a nice touch without being overbearing.

Prior to getting pregnant I was doing CrossFit 4x a week, and I was missing pushing myself in a workout.  I think this DVD allows for that push, but does so in a safe way for us pregnant gals.  I actually think this DVD will be great after the baby comes too.",1490572800,2,593,4.258928571428571
6363995,4,B00JJSDPBA,"Good workout video for pregnant moms who don't have a lot of time, but really want to stay in shape. You definitely sweat and the moves are challenging (in a good way). My only issue with her teaching style is some of the moves are hard to follow and awkward for a pregnant woman (especially with a big belly throwing off your balance), and she goes WAY too fast during some of the workouts. You definitely need to watch it a few times to get into the groove of it, and be sure to accept your limitations...go at your own pace at first until you feel comfortable following along (if your belly and balance allows).",1490572800,,614,4.3478260869565215
6363996,5,B00JJSDPBA,I consider myself moderately fit and this DVD kicked my bum! Love it! Get yourself some hand weights and get your sweat on! Perfect for all pregnancy and I will use it post as well.,1490140800,,181,4.2
6363997,4,B00JJSDPBA,"I was looking for a challenging workout to do while pregnant and I'd say this is the most challenging prenatal workout DVD I've found. Unfortunately, it borders too challenging for me now that I am now deep into my third trimester. Some of the exercises are starting to get too difficult and I feel like there aren't enough modifications. I like the music because it's really upbeat and is fun to workout to. Each segment is only 15 minutes so you can tailor your workout to your needs and schedule. She moves quickly through the intervals so the workouts seem to go by quickly which I like. I don't love the core workout. It seems to stress parts of my abs that I've been told not to strain while pregnant so I always skip the core section and use another DVD to work my core comfortably.",1489968000,2,789,4.410958904109589
6363998,5,B00JJSDPBA,I am really enjoying this DVD so farI am in my third trimester and this is just the right amount of challenge for this phase of my pregnancy. I feel like I get a good workout but all of the movements are pretty low-impact (my regular DVDs & workouts I use require a lot of jumping & jarring movements.) I like that I feel challenged but also like it's not too much for my changing body. I love that it's broken up into 15 minute segments that make it really customizable! I recommend.,1488844800,,484,4.21505376344086

I've always been working out and when I got pregnant I was scared I wouldn't be able to, I didn't know the do's and don'ts for the safety of me and my baby. So I figured getting a DVD would help and I bought 3 different ones.. the first one didn't challenge me enough but this is the second I tried and it's perfect. A great challenge and the main menu is broken down into the different workouts. They are all quick but still challenging so I usually do 2 a day. Love it!",1483833600,,496,4.02020202020202
6364002,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I love this dvd! The 15 minute segments are great for when you're feeling low energy or you can do multiple in a sitting. It's not the most challenging workout I've ever done, but I definitely feel like I'm doing something without worrying about my baby. Before getting pregnant I would do power yoga, and body weight exercises 4-5 times a week. I tried to do my regular yoga after getting pregnant and it wiped me out for the rest of the day, I was so happy when I got this DVD.",1483747200,,479,4.217391304347826

6364004,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I really loved this video when I was pregnant. I was used to challenging workouts before I was pregnant, so some other prenatal videos were a little too easy.

6364025,5,B00JJSDPBA,This is exactly what I was looking for in a prenatal work out. I love the the fact that you can stack the workouts or just do a 15 minute segment so there is no excuse to not push play! The workouts are great! The level of difficulty is just what I needed.

6364030,5,B00JJSDPBA,"Great exercises. Upper Body, Core, Lower Body, Cardio and Sculpt + stetch. The DVD is time driven so you can mix and match or follow her weekly program (15 min exercises). It is divided in 3 levels depending on your stamina Level 1 = 15 min sessions, Level 2 = 30 min to 45 and Level 3: 45 min. No need to BUY anything and she is not promoting products or diets.
Easy to use, doesn't tax on your back and adaptable to any stages or level. I would caution the stretch exercises as ligament get looser with pregnancy and she does a lot of upper torso twist.... I don't recommend, But I would caution on any stretch for any videos you end up buying. I would buy a second dvd of hers to mix the fun.",1478476800,,695,4.08029197080292

Leah S. is very encouraging and very pleasant to listen to. I love how she isn't obnoxious like the vast majority of wafer thin trainer videos out there.
Since I'm not in the best shape( I'm only slightly overweight) I love being able to work out in my own living room with my toddler. I'm not embarrassed to get all sweaty lol.

All you need is a small set of hand weights and a yoga mat and to safely get your heartrate up and feel a good intensity of a workout and there are modifications to be done depending on your fitness level.

I didn't do any modifications and while it was definitely a challenge I did it!!! Only 30 minutes with warm up + workout and I feel great. Can't wait for next workout.",1469318400,6,861,4.2439024390243905

6364053,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I ordered quite a few prenatal fitness DVDs, this is by far my favorite. I tend to do all the segments together. The instructor is not annoying at all, which is rare in fitness DVDs. I have continued working out nearly everyday during my pregnancy, but found the classes at the gym weren't all ideal for me as my pregnancy progressed. I also, found that by having more DVDs I have less of an excuse to skip a workout as I don't even need to leave the house. I plan to use it postnatal as well when I won't be able to leave my baby to go to the gym.

The segments on here have good variety and plenty of modifications to accommodate each stage of pregnancy.

I started using this workout early on in my pregnancy and have only had to drop down one training level to modify, still able to keep lifting the same weights as the beginning. It is easy to determine what level you should be using based on your pre-pregnancy workout level and has more training levels than any other prenatal workout program I've seen. The only drawback to this program is that it does get boring after doing it for the entire pregnancy. I wish I had been better about figuring out how to work in more variety early on in my pregnancy instead of only using this. It is the only pregnancy that I've consistently heard the words ""Your weight gain is perfect!"" from my doc. I've also had less leg cramps and far less stretch marks this pregnancy than my previous 2, so it's done it's job.",1460419200,,870,4.44375
6364069,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I bought this dvd at 14 weeks when I started feeling like I needed to modify exercises in my normal routine, but wasn't sure exactly how. Before pregnancy I ran several times a week and stuck pretty close to the workout schedule Tone It Up posts weekly. First trimester I was able to keep up my normal routine, just scaled back. Then all the ab work and some of the floor work I was usually doing started to feel funny, so I bought this dvd to help. OMG its no joke! I did the arm workouts last night and there was so much burning! This workout is legit, pregnant or not. I think I'll still need to supplement the dvd with some walk/run intervals for some moderate cadio, but I think I definitely found my go-to for strength training.

If you're a beginner, this probably isn't the dvd for you. But if you're like me and were active before pregnancy and have gotten to the point where you know you need to adjust, but aren't sure how.. This is definitely for you and will not disappoint.",1459814400,,987,4.306451612903226

My wife is in very good shape and she still found the routines challenging but well-suited for her changing physique. I did the workouts with her and enjoyed them as well. One thing to keep in mind if you buy this is that you will need hand weights of several sizes (2, 3, 5 lbs etc.) to do most of the routines.",1459296000,4,378,4.121621621621622
6364073,5,B00JJSDPBA,"Early in pregnancy, doing 2 segments felt a little too easy on some days. (For background, I was working out 3-4xs per week and running about 3 miles before getting pregnant). On other days, though, it was a great challenge for me to do 2-3 of the segments at once. In my third trimester, it's a wonderful challenge doing 2 segments. I come out of it feeling worn out, which is what I want when I work out. She has some really good exercises in there--exercises I see recommended other places such as from my pelvic floor physical therapist friend, Prepare to Push (a book focused on pelvic floor health), Hypnobirthing, and other websites I've researched.

Her style is perfect for me--she's calm and positive, and I think she'd appeal to most women. I wasn't able to continue with the prenatal core segment past the first trimester due to coccyx pain, but that's not her fault! I like all the segments she has. I found the lower body barre to be the most challenging. I do think the prenatal stretching segment goes too fast, so I run through a section with her, then pause the DVD and run through it again at a slower pace to allow for deeper stretching.

6364107,5,B00JJSDPBA,"This workout kicked my butt during my second pregnancy and I really wasn't that out of shape. It's just that she doesn't sugar coat things just because you're pregnancy. I really enjoyed all of the segments, especially the cardio and upper body segment. I also loved the yoga stretching session at the end of the dvd. Overall, I was in much better shape this pregnancy than I was during my first. I had a repeat c-section so I can't say it helped with labor, but my recovery was much quicker and smoother than my first and I attribute it to this video. Take it slow at first, even if you're  in pretty good shape.",1456444800,,613,4.37719298245614
6364108,5,B00JJSDPBA,"This is probably the best prenatal workout I've had so far. I take standard barre classes and modify myself as a Pilates instructor, but this workout is tougher than your standard barre workout. (I'm still modifying Jillian Michael's DVDs and like to be challenged, I will say this definitely does the job!)

To get a full body hour class I did the warm up, upper body cardio, lower body sculpt, core, and stretch. Next time I'll switch up the upper body and lower body workout options so I have two class varieties and do not get bored.

PROS
I love the heavier weights - you don't normally see this in barre videos or classes and I think this is much better than 3lbs or less. The movements make sense for heavier weights as well.
Good options to switch it up with the 2 different upper body and 2 lower body workouts.
Decent music and not cheesy/cheap production.

CONS
I don't love the set up inside the cover with workout suggestions for myself. I preferred mixing and matching as I pleased.
I think some of her ab series is meant for 1st trimester and early second trimester mothers. I'm 26 weeks and found some of the movements awkward and difficult. It was a 15 minute core portion and about 10 minutes of it were fine.",1456358400,2,1227,4.46875

I have only gained 14 pounds at 27 weeks and I think a lot of it has to do with this workout regime. Each workout is designed to target specific muscle groups and really define and tone. I love that they are just 15 minutes long so you can do 2-4 in a day and get a solid workout in. Her stretching segment at the end is AMAZING. I suffer from very tight hips and hip flexors (prior to pregnancy and now especially,) but her moves have really helped me. Overall her workouts are challenging yet not too overwhelming.

I didn't have the energy during my first trimester, and a placental scare early in my second trimester left me feeling hesitant.  I am now entering my third trimester, and feeling the overwhelming urge to prepare by body for labor and delivery.  Enter Prenatal Physique.  This DVD features 15 minute exercise segments that are safe during all trimesters.  Segments include upper body, lower body, core, and stretching exercises.  Modifications are included to accommodate all fitness levels and growing bellies.  Included with the DVD is a workout calendar, which provides pacing for both beginner exercisers and those who are more advanced.  The workouts are challenging without seeming impossible, and leave me feeling energized and strong.  I've noticed a big difference in my comfort since introducing regular exercise back into my schedule. I also feel like I'm doing something positive for my baby every time I exercise.

I started doing this DVD 5 months in and really enjoyed it while still making it to the gym on the weekends.  As I got into my 3rd trimester I just cycled between this DVD and another one every other day for about 30 minutes or so.  I particularly enjoy the cardio sculpt and barre work because it was the closest thing I had to feeling like I was still doing cardio weights or training.  You need weights for 2 sections and I had 3lb and 5lb weights and just stuck with those and doubled up when needed.  The abs section was really really tough despite how strong I thought I was.

I love that it is divided into segments that you can pick and choose depending on what you feel like doing and how much time you have. I really enjoy the sections with the weights (one for upper and one for lower body) and the stretching. The mat and barre workouts are challenging but really great workouts. I have tried other prenatal DVD's and find this one to be the most difficult but most rewarding. As I get further into my pregnancy I've had to modify it a bit (mostly the ab section) but it's been a great way to stay in shape and keep toned. I plan on keeping it for after baby also - the workouts are that good. I also really like Leah Sarago. She is friendly and upbeat and really keeps you moving along. The video was done nicely and the background music fits with each segment. I do this a few times a week, along with mixing in another prenatal video and do cardio every other day. Sometimes I mix it up and do cardio and then a section. All you need are some free weights (light, medium and heavy, I just use 5 and 10 lb weights), a sturdy chair, a mat (or thick rug if you are doing this in your living room or other carpeted area) and a wall to use for one exercise in the barre segment.

Instruction is concise, great menu format for the segments, and 15 min segments make it really easy to fit in a workout (add another 5 min warmup and 10 min cool down/stretch). I started out at beginner (1 segment) in 1st trimester and was up to advanced (3 segments) by 3rd trimester. The workouts are also easy to modify as you progress (lower weights, take out step work, etc) and don't require a lot of repositioning or modification. For context, pre-pregnancy I was in good shape but nothing hardcore (lifted weights moderately in 12-45 lbs range and ran a few miles a week). I tried Shiva Rea's prenatal yoga which mostly felt like some stretching and breathing, no workout or fitness, no modularity (really don't get the high user ratings). I also tried Karyne Steben's Perfect pregnancy workout... which is a good, serious workout. Unfortunately, it was personally less appealing/motivating somehow (maybe the setting? the 40 min commitment?) and I didn't use it much which defeats the point. I might try one of Suzanne Bowen's DVDs to mix things up.",1445990400,3,1135,4.947643979057592
6364133,5,B00JJSDPBA,"Please note: I am writing about my experiences, but you should always consult your doctor before doing any exercise, especially when pregnant.

Prior to becoming pregnant, I had been running and doing a variety of intense workout DVDs--especially Les Mills Combat and Les Mills Pump. I had built up my fitness level to the point where I was comfortable running 5Ks in under 30 minutes and had grown accustomed to working out intensely for 45-60 minutes daily on most days of the week.

I kept up this activity level (doing the same activities, only a bit less intense as time went on) until I was about 20 weeks pregnant. At that point, I suffered a minor injury (strained back and ab muscles) because I did not know how to properly modify the weight lifting DVD I was doing. (Yes, I had modified the amount of weight I was lifting, as per doctor's orders, but I did not know how to be sure I wasn't straining any muscles that shouldn't be strained). I also did not feel as comfortable running because of my growing belly bouncing around.

I knew I had to find a prenatal workout, but I didn't want one that wouldn't be a challenge. That said, I found the perfect fit with Prenatal Physique.

To begin, the DVD assumes that you do have a basic level of fitness before you became pregnant. I could not see someone starting with this DVD from scratch, while pregnant, without any kind of fitness background. When I first started the warm-up, I thought it was too easy, but she keeps up the pace for the entire warm-up, and by the end, I did feel like my muscles were warmed and being challenged. In fact, at one point my husband came into the room for one of the mat workouts (similar to yoga) and admitted that he would not be able to complete the entire workout!

After the warm-up, which you should always do to begin, the rest of the DVD is a series of 15-minute segments you can choose from. You can customize your workout to a short 15 minutes, or you can add several together. I usually do 30 or 45 minutes at a time (plus warm-up and cool-down). For many of the segments, you need a set of light, medium, and heavy weights. I only have 5, 10, and 25 pounds weights at home, so I use the 5 as the ""light or medium"" and the 10 as the ""heavy"" weights (my doc warned against anything greater than 20). There are segments with more of a cardio/weight-lifting feel (which felt very familiar and comfortable for me) and segments with more of a yoga/barre feel (which were a bit foreign to me). Both types of workouts challenged my muscles (especially because you can modify the amount of weight you are comfortable lifting), and I was even a little sore the next day (nothing like what I was used to feeling, but it was nice to know I was challenging my muscles a bit). I also like the 15-minute stretch segment at the end as the cool-down. She is careful to do only stretches that are appropriate.

What I like the most about the video is that the exercises she leads you through feel very safe. I never felt that I was going to pull any muscles. In short, she has already modified the exercises to perfectly fit the pregnant body. (She is visibly pregnant while working out with you). I also like the fact that she is very calm while leading the exercises. She's not one of those crazy workout instructors who yells motivational things to you about pushing yourself. (It's not that I don't like those kinds of instructors; it's just that pregnancy is not the time to push yourself to a pain threshold). She also gives tips about how to modify each exercise either to provide more of a challenge, or less of a challenge, and she does address possible modifications for when you progress in your pregnancy.

In short: it's a great DVD for people with a good fitness background prior to becoming pregnant. It can either replace or help modify existing workouts. I can see it being a challenge for people without any fitness background.",1445731200,7,3933,4.476987447698745

There's a warm-up, five 15-minutes workouts (2 upper, 2 lower, and core), and a 15-minute stretching segment - so you can do a simple 15 minute (20 with warm-up) workout if you're tired, and more if you're feeling up to it.  Most of the exercises are easy to pick up, but there are a few that are a little advanced for me.  Most of these have modifications.  The core segment is a little hard; I wouldn't advise it for beginners in their first trimester (or if you do it, make sure to take it easy and modify freely as you go).  But for the most part, the exercises are fun and interesting, and the woman on the DVD is pleasant and engaging.",1444608000,,756,4.179310344827586

6364186,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I bought four prenatal exercise DVDs, and this is the one I use most regularly. Granted, I sometimes only do the warmup and the stretches, but still . . . When I first tried this DVD, I was surprised at its level of difficulty. (I started with the core workout, and I think that's one of the more difficult ones.) I am not super fit, though I was a daily walker and did yoga before getting pregnant. I also didn't own hand weights, so I wasn't sure how useful the weight-requiring workouts would be for me. But I find I can substitute lotion bottles or water bottles for the hand weights (as I wasn't lifting before pregnancy anyway), and now I do all the segments from time to time. I just choose the one I feel most like doing and then do the stretching segment afterwards.

I get much less bored with this DVD than with others, and I like the challenge. Leah doesn't repeat the same exercises over and over again like the other prenatal fitness DVDs that I have. I also love that the workouts are in fifteen-minute segments: you can choose whichever segment(s) you most feel like doing that day. I wish ALL pre-natal exercise videos were in 1520 minute segments like this. I have NEVER gotten through the hour of repetitive yoga on another DVD (though I like yoga), and I only managed the Long and Lean video once through as the exercises just kept repeating themselves, and it was dull.

Its obviously not high intensity, but I find that I still feel it the next day, and I do ""glisten"" through some of it. :) So far I've done the upper body mat segment, the upper body cardio sculpt, the prenatal stretching, and the lower body barre. I really enjoyed the stretching, and see that as coming in handy the closer I get to delivery. I like that it comes with a ""game plan"". I was wondering how to split the segments up, and opened the DVD to see that they do it for you! There is a beginner levels 1-3 and an advanced (I think) leves 1-3. I'm starting at the beginning and will be working my way up. Really looking forward to using this throughout the rest of my pregnancy!",1436745600,,1072,4.365
6364188,5,B00JJSDPBA,"Just bought this dvd and popped it in this morning. The workout (upper body cardio) is fast paced and interesting and keeps me going. I hate upper body workouts and usually give up too early but the distracting cardio movements kind of mask the strain and pain.

The best part of this video though, is the stretching segment. 33 weeks pregnant and I didn't know how sore and achy I was! She targets just the right muscles for pregnancy. SO GOOD. I would've gotten this dvd just for the stretching segment.",1436227200,,505,4.549450549450549
6364189,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I actually love this prenatal workout DVD. Usually I get bored easily while working out but actually don't mind doing these. They're the perfect level of difficulty for me and I feel like I get a great workout. If I want to do more, I just add another 15 minute segment.",1432944000,,270,4.313725490196078
6364190,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I have bought about 12 workout videos since being pregnant. I had a really difficult time finding workouts that were challenging enough since there weren't may reviews online, so here is my review. I hope you find it helpful!

Pre-pregnancy I ran around 20 miles a week, and did an addition 2-4 strength days a week. I am very active and in good shape. However, After my first two months of pregnancy I couldn't run anymore, so I started looking for ways to build muscle safely and effectively as well as find alternative cardio routines. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and can still perform all of these videos. I have seen muscle gain (as has my husband and mid-wives who compliment how well I've stayed in shape!), and I can't wait until I loose this bit of baby fat to really see the definition! The following are my favorite 4 videos that I really found challenging and effective, as well as great for times I have had more or less energy throughout pregnancy. They have really helped keep me in shape when I couldn't run or do military-like workouts anymore!

1. Fit+Sleek Prenatal Physique with Leah Sarago. Moderate/difficult. The weight portions allow you to add additional weight so you can continue to challenge yourself. Easy to mix and match and repeat sections for more reps. My favorite on this video is the upper body and ab portions. I usually do two workouts twice per per day when doing this video. The lower body is also very good. It's also a nice video for when you don't have a lot of time or energy to have the option of doing a 15-30 minute workout since each section is just 15 minutes. Has a good workout suggestion guide. Also, the pre-natal stretch is AMAZING!

2. Expecting More with Sara Haley: Moderate/Difficult. Okay, so this one I have mixed feelings. Over all, I do love it since the workouts are longer (Around an hour, depending) and they are very effective. She just kind of gets on my nerves sometimes with her silly dance moves and the tone she uses. You do have to be careful and be sure to follow moderation's if you aren't as fit--some of the jumping and twisting around can be scary if you don't know how to do it right. She is good at her instructions and making sure you and baby stay safe. Over all, some of these are very challenging, and some are easier. I love the cardio portions, though her strength portions are great, and you will want bumb-bells. Also is a fun video if you like to dance!

3. Long and Lean prenatal Workout with Suzanne Bowen: Easy/Moderate. This was one of my first prenatal videos, and still one of my favorites. I do this one on the days where I have no energy. It does a good job working shoulders and your lower body groups. In the past couple months I have added light weights (3-5lbs) to some of the arm and squat portions to challenge myself more. There is no cardio, really, but is a nice, effective Pilates style workout. My sister, who is a Marine, did this one with me some months after having her 3rd child and felt a little sore the next day. This is one that will def get easier pretty quick if you are moderately to in good shape. But it is effective enough, and more relaxing on those super sleepy, growing a baby days :)

4. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout with Karyne Steben. Moderate/Difficult. LOVE this workout! Karyne is a world class athlete and this video shows that. This chick is buff! I have been doing this video for about 6 months, and still find it a little challenging. She covers all main muscle groups, lower body, abs, back, side-body, in very safe and effective ways. I do feel most of the focus is in the upper back and arms, so you will def be feeling this the next day! You will want dumb-bells this one. This video is a bit relaxing in style, and it is a bit on the old fashion side (as far as music and quality), but it is really great and one of my favorites.

All of these videos have great stretch portions that I feel are very effective in getting baby where he/she needs to be for delivery, and really helps get your body get into optimal shape for delivery as well. Like I said, my mid-wives have complimented me on how well I have stayed in shape, and my husband has taken lots of notice, too. He thinks I have more muscle on me now than I did pre-pregnancy! I do these videos about 5 times a week and have felt healthy and good throughout my pregnancy. I hope my review helps you!",1432339200,246,4393,4.397293972939729
6364191,5,B00JJSDPBA,Leah does a great job explaining the moves and making the sessions enjoyable.  I would love to buy a postnatal workout from her!,1432166400,,128,4.565217391304348
6364192,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I love this video and definitely feel like I'm getting  a great workout! I'm now 20 weeks, have been doing it since 16 weeks and can feel a difference. It will definitely help with many aspects ts of pregnancy.",1431820800,,210,4.384615384615385
6364193,5,B00JJSDPBA,LOVE THIS VIDEO!,1431561600,,16,4.666666666666667
6364194,5,B00JJSDPBA,I am usually not one for DVD workouts but the way that this DVD has the 15 minute segments done over the course of a week is great.  Highly recommend for those who need to find a way to work out while pregnant.,1431388800,,210,3.883720930232558
6364215,4,B00JJSDPBA,"Great workout dvd!  I'm not into prenatal yoga, and I wanted something a bit more upbeat with both cardio and sculpting.  This one is a winner!  Sarago is a pleasant instructor: as other reviewers have stated, she isn't overly peppy or annoying; she talks TO you and not AT you, which I really like.  The exercises are just challenging enough for me but easily modified for a more intense or less intense workout.  Each workout segment targets specific areas, but she still keeps your entire body moving and engaged regardless of which you choose.  The warm up is fun, the stretching nice, but my favorite is the upper body cardio sculpt.  It isn't too much for my tired, pregnant self to accomplish, and my arms are definitely showing more definition.  There are moments when Sarago gets off-beat in her repetitions, but it's fine - not really distracting or anything.

My one minor suggestion is to have just a bit more low-intensity cardio.  I don't have room in my house for a treadmill or elliptical, and it would be nice to get that 30 min. of activity in other than the focus on sculpting, especially on a rainy day when I can't walk my neighborhood.  Also, and this is minor but worth mentioning, the dance-beat music grates on my nerves after a while.  What's worse is that there are songs that I definitely recognize and wouldn't have minded if they were the original (ex: Guetta's ""Titanium"" featuring Sia and Ellie Goulding's ""Lights""), but they have different words and a second-rate auto-tuned singer that sounds like a Brittney Spears blow-up doll to me.  Ugh...drives me crazy after a while!  : )",1429056000,,1612,4.731182795698925
6364216,4,B00JJSDPBA,"Great workout.  Love that she is just a normal person...not too extreme or peppy, just talks you through the workout.  Portions of this workout are a little above my fitness level and too challenging, but I did kind of let myself go at the beginning of my pregnancy.  With extreme fatigue, constant nausea and a toddler, and I wasn't up to doing much of anything.  But I really enjoy the 15 minute segments and I feel like I can modify most of the workouts.  I also think this will continue to be a great workout after delivery.",1428105600,,528,4.402061855670103
6364217,5,B00JJSDPBA,Great video! Exhausting workout.,1427241600,,32,7.25
6364218,4,B00JJSDPBA,"I really like most of this work out DVD.  Something that really bothers me- when she is describing the next move, often times the camera will zoom in to another part of the body.  For example, she is telling you what to do with your arms and the camera shows only the lower half of her body.  This has become progressively challenging for me as I have entered the 3rd trimester and for being such short work outs I definitely get my heart rate up (no more than 15mins each segment).  The stretch routine is by far my favorite of any stretch routine I have done through out pregnancy, it is unique and really stretches the pelvis/lower back.",1427241600,,640,4.398305084745763
6364219,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I love these workouts and I am so glad I bought them. Previous to pregnancy I had been doing P90X semi regularly and was working on the ""Couch to 5K"" running program. I was very fit in the past but had let it slip away and was trying to get it back before getting pregnant. Anyway my point is that was in decent good shape when I got pregnant. Then the morning sickness set in. I didn't do a thing but maybe go on 2-3 mile walks a few times a week for about 6 weeks. Stopping workouts got me out of shape during the majority of the first trimester so one day at Target I grabbed the only prenatal workout dvds they had which were by ""Moms Into Fitness"" with Lindsay Brin....NOT THESE. They helped me get my energy and fitness back but after just a few short weeks I was wanting to pull out my hair for so many reasons. Reasons I won't exactly go into here but maybe I will leave a review over there.

So I searched for a better dvd and workout plan and this had the best most consistent reviews. It has beginner levels 1, 2, and 3 as well as trained levels 1, 2, and 3. All the same workouts but just added together or separated to get more or less of a workout. I started on trained level 1 but went up to level 2 to get more workout time. I love that each workout is 15 mintutes. Time flies by and I feel like I really accomplished something substantial. And if I get too tired after one or two workouts (since Im almost in my 3rd trimester) I just stop and come back later if I want.

She doesn't speed through the workouts or movements and gives you time to get into position. She spends plenty of time on each movement or stretch. I feel like I am taking a class and she is the instructor. The other workouts I did with other trainers felt silly and not so mature. I also love that she is PREGNANT! Sounds silly but it is so hard to follow a workout when the instructor is skinny and just flying through it all. Her voice is calm and she explains each thing you are doing. It just felt so much more sophisticated and substantial that those other cheap dvds I bought.

The only thing I have to say is that although I love these and dislike the Lindsay Brin dvds I think I would get bored doing any workouts multiple times per week so I have combined these with my old dvds just for a change of scenery but my favorite days are when I working out with Leah Sarago.

I don't think you'll regret this purchase if you are like me. A not in prefect physical shape but not a couch potato pregnant person.",1426464000,19,2502,4.1
6364220,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I would highly recommend this DVD for your pregnancy!  I am using this DVD for my second pregnancy.  My first pregnancy I did not have this particular DVD and wish I would have!  I am an avid at home work out mom that uses P90X and gets to the gym when I can.  This DVD came with a recommended workout regimen, great for those that do not work out all the time and for those that are into a regimen of working out.  I love the fact the sessions are in 15 minute incriments!  You can mix and match the workouts as well as split up the workouts to fit the needs of your schedule.  With this being the second pregnancy and taking care of a 2-yr-old and 2 part time jobs--working out for  an hour or longer is the last thing that motivated me to get up, as you all know--you're extra exhausted during pregnancy anyhow! I looked forward to putting this DVD in as the instructor is upbeat and the workouts are just what I need to get in exercise and keep up with my workout goals through the 9 months.  I also like that she addresses working out your abs during pregnancy so as to not tear them when they separate to accommodate the holding of your baby and your bump!",1425945600,,1162,4.151785714285714

6364224,5,B00JJSDPBA,"Love this workout video. Leah leads a great pregnancy workout - it's not too hard yet your muscles feel it afterward, the movements are smooth and reassuring for pregnancy, the music is upbeat and trendy and her voice is motivating (barre segment!) and calming (during stretches).
The 15 minute segments are really nice for time constrained days, and different levels of fitness and pregnancy trimesters.
I've done a lot of workout videos, and this is one I both enjoy and recommend.",1424563200,3,483,4.9753086419753085
6364235,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I am in mid 30s, live in NYC, and was in fairly decent shape prior to pregnancy (benchmark - Ran marathon 1 year prior to getting pregnant. Was trying to find prenatal videos to work out at home before going to work.(30- 45 mins max long). I needed the video to be engaging, and not too spiritual. I wanted a good sweat .Here is why i give Leah's videos 5 stars:  1) well organized (15 minute segments only) that gives you the ability to either keep it short or add on increments 2) workout moves are ballet-like and works up a good sweat  3) the music is recent (like Elie Goulding) and her voice is pleasant (not talking too much)  3) she keeps comments about baby minimal. After doing it for 2 months - still not bored and see results. Also they give you a plan to move from level 1 to 3..Another perk is you just need a simple mat, and dumbbells and a chair. I had bought other videos such as shiva rea or element yoga and they were too slow and boring with too many spiritual comments (i.e. feel the baby stretch with you or really slow strange voice over )

 I had shiva rea's prenatal yoga and element prenatal yoga and both were too slow, with spiritual comments.",1424044800,3,1171,4.256756756756757

The dvd is divided in 15 min sections and 5 min warm up, I'm 23 weeks and I'm doing the warm up plus two 15 min. I really like this workout you can really feel you are toning your arms and legs.

There is also a workout plan for beginners and advanced (levels 1-3) for what your weekly routine should look like. I've been using it as a guide and have been feeling really challenged.

The production of the DVD is high quality.  Leah never rushes through any of her 15 minute workouts is well thought out and you feel like all muscles are worked out after each segment.

6364243,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I love this DVD :) I'm very active and did Zuzka's Zgym diligently for over a year before getting pregnant. I'm now 28 weeks pregnant, and I've continued to do Zgym (with modification and doctors approval) but as my belly grows, I need some specific prenatal workouts. I was looking for something challenging and had done Leah Sarago workouts before, so I was excited to try her prenatal DVD.

Unlike other prenatal videos (which seem way to easy for me) Leah activates new muscles and it's challenging and still safe for pregnancy. My thighs were burning in the barre segment! Which I was surprised given how many squats and lunges I do in a HIIT type workout. I really like that the Leah's DVD is segmented into 15 minute workouts & she provides a wonderful schedule of which segments to do on certain days. I really appreciate and rely on the pros telling me what the workout schedule should be. I adore the stretching segment! I'm notorious for doing a hard workout and not stretching. But I like Leah's stretching segment so much I do it everyday...it feels so good and is keeping me limber as my belly grows.

The production quality is great, music, angles, everything very professional which I truly appreciate. Leah is a wonderful instructor! She's encouraging, provides great instruction, talks just the right amount and is so motivating as she executes all the moves beautifully while sporting a cute belly bump! If she ever makes another DVD, I will be purchasing it :)",1413590400,2,1480,4.754863813229572
6364244,5,B00JJSDPBA,"LOVE -- ordered it around 20 weeks pregnant (now 35 weeks) but have not used it consistently. It is TOUGH, and I was in decent shape prior to getting pregnant. Her barre portion is killer on the legs (wall squats!) and I wish I had used it more often but I plan to use this in combination with other barre workouts and walking to get back into shape after baby. The arm segment was tough even in second tri, but I lack upper body strength in general and this just proved it - I would love to be able to do the moves the way Leah does them! The stretch segment alone is well worth the money -- unique but not uncomfortable stretches to really get into the muscles and joints without overdoing it. I always tell my hub that this is the BEST stretch segment I've ever done on a DVD (and I have A LOT, including several Beachbody programs) and will continue to use the stretch segment long after baby is here.

Exercising has always been in my weekly routine, so I was already in really good shape prior to being pregnant.  Once I became pregnant, I became exhausted and sick, but I needed some sort of workout to keep up with my hopes of maintaining an exercise routine.  There are so many things that I love about this video.  The music is great, she has a very calm and sweet voice, not annoying at all, and she has an amazing pregnant body that motivates you as you go along.  There are a few segments that are broken down into 15 mins each, so you can do as little or as much as you want. There is also a workout program guide inside the dvd in case you have no idea where to start, which was great for a beginner or if you are more advanced!  I was surprised to find some of her moves challenging, but I wanted that.  She moves into the different types of exercises at a pretty fast pace, which I appreciated since I'm not a newbie.

8651540,5,B00JJSDPBA,"I'm loving this DVD! It's a bit more expensive than many other prenatal workout DVDs out there, but it's worth it.

Prior to pregnancy, I ran 3 miles, three times a week. In fact, I've been working out three times a week for several years, but this DVD has me working out 5-6 times a week!! It's not that it's easy, because it's really quite challenging-rather, it has me feeling strong, energized, and excited about working out!

One of my favorite things about this DVD is that it's broken up into 15 minute segments! I'll commit mentally to one segment, which makes it easier to go ahead and complete two!

The only thing that bothers me about this DVD is that Leah loses track of her counting a lot. She'll say, ""eight more"", so I'll start counting in my head, then we'll end up doing 12 more. But she has a relaxing way about her that is pleasing to follow along with.

Some of the workouts have been more challenging than others for me, personally. They leave me sore, and a couple of the exercises are ones I'll have to build up more strength to be able to do, but I've been very pleased with the overall level of difficulty.

You really do need to buy three sets of hand weights (I bought 2, 3, and 5) and have a yoga mat to use. With our wood floors, I purchased the thickest one I could find.

Buy this DVD, you'll be glad you did. :)",1516233600,,1344,4.250980392156863
