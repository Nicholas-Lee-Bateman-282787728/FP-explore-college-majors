4390554,5,B004J6MKCC,"A beautiful story about a beautiful character. Not exactly hard on the eyes, Hrithik Roshan steps out of his usual Bollywood song and dance persona to play a very different and touching role. I've seen it twice, the second time just to study him. He is a fine actor. More recently, he has become a superstar hearthrob with quite a few fan clubs around the world. I've always admired his talent. Now he's truly made it to the top. This film is one reason.",1424476800,,454,4.416666666666667
4390555,3,B004J6MKCC,"Rented Movie - Guzaarish. Cost was reasonable, process to rent was straight forward. Video/Sound quality was alright, but I was expecting it to be very high definition. Overall no major complaints.",1346112000,,197,5.387096774193548
4390556,5,B004J6MKCC,"Main reason for wanting to watch this is the sexy Hrithik Roshan. I loved the way he moved on stage like a ballet dancer. He's also a very great actor, as well as the very beautiful Aishwarya. The acting in general is very good and believable. You really do get an idea of what a paraplegic's day-to-day life is like and how it drives them to such a horrible depression.

SPOILERS

The only thing that disappointed me was the ending. I wish that Hrithik's character experienced his friends working magic with his soul and will to live the way he made his mother smile as a child. That would've been great. But I suppose not all stories have such predictable endings. But they shouldn't have to, so I will not rate the movie based on the ending.",1340150400,2,744,4.423357664233577
4390557,4,B004J6MKCC,"Without giving away the outcome, I can tell you that despite the somber subject matter, this is a *feel good* movie- in an ironically tear jerker, kind of way. ( If you watch it, you will understand why I wrote that).

The two leading stars are very convincing in their parts.

 The subject matter of human euthanasia is something many of us do not like to think about.

Euthansia is an ancient word that translates roughly into: * a good death- merciful death*.

While you become charmed immediately by the lead character's upbeat personality- at the same time you will notice his positive outlook and how he dealt with his quadraplegic status over the years is in stark contradiction to wishing to end his life.

Since the movie's plot focus, is about his desire to end his life, naturally, many viewers will be  hoping he will change his mind.

Then again,many people may relate to his predicament and completely understand his position, to be allowed to die.

When the movie ends, it will give you something to think about regarding euthanasia and  how it can never really be a black or white issue or question.

Neither does it come with a black or white answer.

So many shades of gray are here.

 But, unlike instances we have seen in America, where some people were forced to pull the plug or cease feeding *brain dead* family members, this is a man who has his mental faculties intact.

 He is of sound mind-  just not of sound body. This is his wish.

 (In  cases with brain dead people, and the ugly fights among family over whether to pull the plug or withhold food, etc- the person that is in the hospital bed, has no say.)

So there are some similarities to health situations that seem to have a poor or dismal prognosis- whether that person in the predicament is alert and reasonable or brain dead and unable to express what their desires would be in such a scenario.

When the movie begins, our lead character has already been in a quadraplegic state for over a decade.

He has a beautifully upbeat attitude, despite his circumstances and especially considering the drastic change his life has taken.

  A tragic accident while performing an act as a magician, renders him a young man that is bedridden and physically helpless.

  The life he had before the accident was so very different from where he finds himself now.  You find yourself quite surprised he does not show any sign of bitterness. To the contrary, he can be quite a humorous ham.

Still, even with a good attitude, he needs constant care for every little thing. EVERY LITTLE THING.

 When you learn he has been in this situation for over a decade, and you see he is a man of optimism about life in general-  it is easy to feel empathy for his personal belief, that due to a quality of life issue, why he would feel that he would be better off not being here.

It is not like he did not attempt to adjust to life as a quadraplegic. He adjusted and then some. He runs a radio station as it is his witty mind and quick tongue that are still intact.

 But we see that his disability is now beginning to wear him down.

It did not kill him physically- but it seems to now be wearing down his spirit.

Does he have a quality of life?  Isn't a good quality of life often subjective?

 And this is how the story begins... a very intimate view of the trials and tribulations of a quadraplegic man, who at heart- is definitely NOT a quitter.

So, you will root for him to live- and yet understand why he wants to die.

 The viewer is  left very unsure of how this will all conclude.

I liked that you felt that the movie could go either way, regardless of your personal opinions on the matter of euthanasia and how you feel about this man.

  With that thought in mind, I can  say that I recommend the movie because of this very hot button issue: the ever so controversial idea of  *mercy killings* .

As my review title states: you will also witness what is for one person to love another in the most dedicated and purest of ways.

 It is very heart touching and both lead actors do a great job in their roles; but Roshnan steals the show because his predicament is the focal point.

Aishwarya definitely can steal any show with just her beauty alone.

Her always stunning, yet soulful blue eyes, speak volumes- no matter what emotion she is experiencing.

 She plays her part well, as a woman you will easily believe is truly devoted to this bedridden man who wants so desperately to leave this world.  A different kind of love story- but that is what makes it so poignant.",1334793600,,4548,4.441212121212121
4390558,5,B004J6MKCC,"Great film . Great scope. Great sentiment. It says it all for itself. The other reviews do better justice than I can on this one. The medical challenges were done in an actual presentation of the harsh realities of both the patient and the caregiver...translation : I could watch it without laughing myself into a coma. ((( please don't put baby powder around bedsores, thank you ))). I saw basically the original with Richard Dreyfuss "" WHOSE LIFE IS IT ANYWAY"" 1981.",1331251200,,468,4.719512195121951
4390559,5,B004J6MKCC,"I'm not a paid critic, nor a paraplegic or a nurse!  I'm definitely not an actor!  But this film brought to sense, what one does in the past can or cannot formulate your present.  What you do with the present sets the path for your future...what would you like your quality of life to be, in a moment, minute, hour, day, week, year, lifetime!  Often times we see suicides for reasons like, debt, drugs, insurance and various inhumane causes (war/politics) and they are self-imposed.  This is not such a case.  This film made me cry, laugh, wanna get up an dance to 'Udi' and appreciate 'What A Wonderful World' I have seen in my life!  You could feel Ethan's rage when Sofia was beaten and taken away by her husband and there was nothing he could do as a paraplegic to help and save her.  Or how it tore his soul when he couldn't embrace his loving and supportive mother.  You could see the change in Sofia regarding Ethan's feelings and wish and how it changes her life.  Who chooses the worth of a man's life and soul?  Society, law, religion or the man. In Ethan's case he gave to all; society, law and religion...and nothing in return replaced what he truly was, a man with feelings, emotions, wants, needs yet would never feel them again.  He could imagine, but imagination does not fill the soul.  Sophia saw this and because of it was willing to give her own life for his.  Such profound love, one to another.  It goes beyond the soul with a promise of forever! I encourage others to view this film and give it great thought.  How would you handle this situation if you were given such a circumstance?

Roshan and Rai have been blessed with a powerful chemistry and have shown it in every film they have done with one another.  They bring realism to a film like Tracey and Hepburn!  Goa...beautiful!  I'll see it one day.",1302307200,10,1828,4.448795180722891
4390560,4,B004J6MKCC,"GUZAARISH is not an abstract and ambiguous film. It's a simply narrated film made with a lot of heart. Although it's sensitive, it never gets dukhi. Sanjay Leela Bhansali has treated the grave issue of mercy killing with maturity. Although it's about a suffering person who wants to end his life, its message is about celebrating life. The best part about the film is that it involves you as a viewer. You surely feel for Ethan's plight. He leaves you smiling in many scenes and moist-eyed in some.

The first half is so breezy that you don't realise when it gets over. The second half is a bit of a drag. Like KAL HO NAA HO and the more recent PAA, GUZAARISH's narrative is very light-hearted laden with humorous moments. Ethan says, 'God pe bharosa hai, isiliye I am dying to meet him.' Also, the scene in which Sofia gives Ethan a leg massage is uproarious.

There are some really poignant moments that leave a lasting impression. Ethan watches a scarecrow on a field, which is symbolic to his own condition. The court-room scenes are just too good. While you expect Ethan to give a long monologue, he conveys everything through his 60-seconds magic trick.",1300579200,4,1159,4.648780487804878
4390561,5,B004J6MKCC,"Ethan is considered the world's best illusionist, but his career is cut short by an accident that leaves him paraplegic.  He lives in a magnificent home and is nurtured by Sofia, a nurse who tends to him every single day.  He begins to feel very ill, and expresses a desire to be euthanized.  His attorney and best friend files a petition to allow his euthanization.  The legal process takes months.

Meanwhile, Ethan broadcasts an inspirational radio show from his home, and begins polling listeners:  Should he be allowed a mercy killing or not? which causes a public debate.  He also takes in a young man named Omar, who wants to be a magician.  Ethan teaches him because, though he wants to die, he does not want his magic to die.

Reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whose-Life-Is-It-Anyway/dp/B000N3SRP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whose Life Is It Anyway?</a>, with a dreamlike quality.  There are visually stunning flashbacks to earlier times in Ethan's life, and his mother as a nightclub singer whose hallmark song is ""What a Wonderful World.""  The color-drenched cinematography is ethereal in a film that is touching, and demonstrates how many lives each of us touches.  This is a masterful film, and I'm certain it will become a classic.",1297036800,12,1302,5.391089108910891

8431685,5,B004J6MKCC,Beautiful movie. Great performance by Hrithik and all artists. It made me feel the life of a man who is locked in his body and the director captured the emotions pretty well. Loved this movie. Simply Awesome,1521849600,,207,4.621621621621622

8431687,5,B004J6MKCC,"This was a tremendous role for Hrithik - he shows his strength and character in his face as if he was really feeling all emotions associated with being a quadriplegic.  Although I don't believe in euthanasia, the experience gives me something to think about.  His acting range is so broad, but I admit I like him in his dancing dynamic roles.  But he made me want to cry when he cried and was sad and in pain. I have watched alot of his movies and even signed up for a trial on Eros so I could see this movie and several others not carried on Amazon prime.  Continue on in your good work, Hrithik.  You are such a dear soul along with  such good looks.  I hope you know how much God has blessed you with the ability to do pretty much any part/thing you would so desire!  I believe you can serve as a role model for so many. Blessings!",1514764800,,834,4.136645962732919

8431690,5,B004J6MKCC,The two main actors of this movie are wonderful! Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan excellent performance. Heavy story line - this is a drama love story. A must see movie.,1468540800,,178,4.774193548387097
8431691,5,B004J6MKCC,I'm a huge fan Hrithik so I watch pretty much every one of his movies..he is a great actor and I don't say that lightly. This movie has so much depth to a character that is paralyzed. The lack of movement in his body causes you to see the rawness and emotions of the movie through his face and eyes. It's a beautiful movie and the nurse was gorgeous but I appreciated her silence as well as she told her story through her actions...will definitely watch it again. And a must see,1465430400,2,478,4.206521739130435
