8629155,5,B00H212WJC,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.

The 2013 Battle Of Los Angeles tournament winner Kyle O'Riley cashed in his championship match against P.W.G. Champion & his former Future Shock partner Adam Cole that saw Kyle resort to his superior mat game with various stretches & submissions along with kicks & chops while Cole resorted to dirty tactics whenever he wasn't showing off to the crowd & taking advantage of any opening he saw as both men showing that they knew each other so well with their various counters throughout the match.  P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks defended the titles against Joey Ryan & Candice LaRae that saw Candice start out the move with a move on both men that had Kevin Steen yelling on commentary ""that b...is on steroids!"" in a match that saw both teams evenly matched from their aerial assaults to being able to use their opponents partner against the other with everyone having their own ""superkick party!""  Speaking of Kevin Steen, he became an ""Ultimate Warrior"" for the night as he faced off against ACH easily overpowering him to the point where he kept having some fun at his expense including ordering something to drink at the bar before ACH was able to use his fast paced aerial offense to his advantage.  Other matches include a four way dance with Brian Cage vs. Tommaso Ciampa vs. Anthony Nese vs. Drake Younger in a non-stop fast paced action battle described as ""the greatest amount of muscle mass in the ring at once"" with various stories playing out such as everyone displaying their strength at one point to brawling both in & out of the ring along with enemies working together that almost tore the building down...literally, Willie Mack & B-Boy vs. PPRay in a very entertaining match from the fan interaction with ""Sexy Jesus"" to Mack & B-Boy's name for their tag team that everyone from the ring announcer to the crowd was afraid to repeat, Best Friends (Chuck Taylor & Trent?) vs. A.R. Fox & Rich Swann in a athletic contest that involved ""Selfie T"" to a figure four jumble to D'Lo Brown being more over during this match than he ever was in Aces & Eights, and Johnny Gargano vs. Roderick Strong in a physical match that saw stiff chops & kicks from both men to the point where one man was bleeding from the mouth.

This was a very strong show from P.W.G. that gave you a taste of everything here from top to bottom with each match having a different style than the others on the card so this is an event I have to recommend.",1390262400,,2784,4.708418891170431
