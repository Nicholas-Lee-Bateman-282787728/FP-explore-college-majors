8541755,1,B009I3EFJC,"Weird movie. The main actors did not portray any real passion, i could not tell for most of the movie if they were in love or just messing around. They were not good people, there was no reason to root for them, no redeeming qualities. Especially the guy, I couldn't tell if he was supposed to be the good guy until maybe the very end of the movie where they have to make it obvious that we should feel bad for him. i felt bad for the entire movie. Skip it.

Also movie is from 2011, not 2007.",1365897600,,493,4.030612244897959
8541756,5,B009I3EFJC,It was filmed at a beautiful Hacienda near Guadalajara. The Hacienda is now a Resort-Spa with the best service and food you can think of. It is Hacienda El Carmen... worth the trip there!,1364515200,,187,4.529411764705882
