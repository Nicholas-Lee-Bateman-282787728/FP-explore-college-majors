8581013,3,B001MGCOAU,"Great Music & Great Compilation of Fantastic Musicians, But Extremely Poor Quality of Picture. So for the Love of Jazz, I Appreciate the Compilation, but for the Picture Quality, I don't even Feel Like Watching it Again cause it's Damaging to the Eyes. In my Opinion, Due to that Picture Quality, this DVD Should not be Sold at All, instead, Make a Cd out of it and Sell that!
