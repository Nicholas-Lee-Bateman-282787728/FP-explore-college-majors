8311536,4,B001IYJV5C,"This is an independent, extremely low-budget movie that's shot on Super 8mm. It's a little slow getting started. There's a bit of topless nudity during the credits with some still pictures. Then you have to wait to around the 29 minute mark until a guy gets his man hood torn off by the gorilla in an ultra cheap FX sequence. This is then quickly followed by a shower sequence that has full nudity and gore. At this point, the film is now fast-paced with the gorilla just running amok and killing; the film now just dishes out the exploitation.  It has a couple of more full nudity scenes, and a good body count with good amount of amateurish gore. The picture quality is extremely crude and gritty with it being so low-budget and filmed Super 8; it looks like you're watching this on VHS. The crude picture quality gives the flick a nice underground trash quality to the whole thing; I guess you might be able to count this as cheap and effective atmosphere. There's no interesting scenery or locations. It takes place at this cheap looking circus and the surrounding area, along with some indoor parts with nothing fancy looking. The directing is pretty good, but this is only recommended for fans of these types of cheap underground type trash films.

There's a commentary, trailers, making of, press book, exploitation journal, original VHS cover, lobby cards, stills and misc. art as extras. You also get a short black-and-white flick called ""One Grave Too Many"" that runs about 6 minutes. This has a bit of topless nudity and some good but really cheap gore. As I said above, THE BLOODY APE doesn't look like DVD quality whatsoever; some may really like this but others won't.",1429142400,,1682,4.698305084745763
8311537,5,B001IYJV5C,"A carnival barker trains his huge ape to kill everyone that crosses him. The ape takes care of several of his enemies. Finally the worse happens and the
ape escapes. The ape goes on a killing spree. His victims are undressed females. There is a black man who falls under immediate suspicion by the police
authorities.(The police chief is really a prize). After killing many females the movie finally comes to an end. I hope these circuses have secure locks on
the ape cages. This movie was so bad that it was good.",1387670400,3,514,4.537634408602151
8311538,1,B001IYJV5C,"If not the worst I've ever seen, it definitely is the worst I own.  My friend and I were barely able to get through this film at all.  Just atrocious.  I refuse to ever sit through this film again.  Something's wrong when the menu is the most entertaining thing on it.

However, I'm keeping the DVD, not just as a reminder of my own incompetence when it comes to most of my blind buys but for the short film on the disc.  There is a short film my the director on the disc that was actually a pretty good short, and almost made up for the horrible experience The Bloody Ape was.

Still, in the end, I'd rather have my money and 77 minutes back.",1382572800,,643,4.096
8311539,4,B001IYJV5C,"Let me be up front and say that The Bloody Ape is probably the worst looking movie I've ever seen. It looks like it cost only $100.00 to make. And the sound is atrocious for about half of the runtime. Still, it has plenty of charm and is often funny. The funniest scene for me was when the ape steals a car and drives it, running someone over. Who taught this ape how to drive? And whenever the two cops are onscreen (including one with an affection for donuts and coffee) the movie is pure gold. The cops chemistry and dialogue reminded me of the cops in Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat. So, The Bloody Ape is far from perfect. And I can't even call it ""good"" per se. It's a bad movie, but it is entertaining enough for me to recommend to fans of low-budget horror and cheesy b-movies.",1357603200,,783,4.157894736842105

Grindhouse exploitation schlockfest at its most vile

Total Z-list horror, this is a classic Edgar Allan Poe adaption.  An ape escapes the carnival and wrecks havoc in town.

Now, another reviewer says this movie never gets boring.  I disagree.  For the first half hour I was constantly eyeing the FF button.  It's just a bunch of idiots exchanging insults, ala Jerry Springer style.  But once The Ape escapes, its all worth the wait.

Fans of beastiality, you're in for a treat.  Ape rape don't get much better.  So romantic, I think they used marshmallow fluff to simulate the ape's erotic pleasure.  Watch the Beast violate and kill the Beauty, plus watching him drive a car is pretty entertaining.

Nothing too clever here, but some good quality fun for fans of wretched grindhouse cinema.

8311541,5,B001IYJV5C,"A couple of years ago, a good friend was kind enough to send me a film that has forever been tattooed in my brain. As a fringe film cineaste, I felt like I had seen it all. But there is nothing quite like ""The Bloody Ape."" Do you love homages to Poe? How about sexually avaricious apes with a penchance for bloodshed? Strippers? Gore? Political incorrectness mixed with heart?

Yes friends, ""The Bloody Ape"" has all this and more. This is horror with heart. The worst crime a film can commit is to be boring and ""TheBloody Ape"" can never be accused of that. Getting to see this film come to the DVD age is going to be a terrific treat.",1231459200,5,635,4.24793388429752
