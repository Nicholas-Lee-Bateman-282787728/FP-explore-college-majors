5021898,5,B006VXX8IQ,"These episodes are very true to Simenon and what I imagined when I read the books long ago. Bruno Cremer is a very good actor and perfect for the part. What I didn't notice when I bought this series was that it was in French. The English subtitles come on automatically and I couldn't find a way to get rid of them, but I needed them anyway. My high school French classes were also long ago. If you are a Simenon fan you will love these mysteries.",1337558400,28,447,4.149425287356322
5021899,5,B006VXX8IQ,"Thank you, the series is very good.
Now I hope more of the programs will be available.

Bruno Cremer was the best Maigret actor there is.
Thank you for making the programs available for us.

5021900,5,B006VXX8IQ,"Yes, Bruno Cremer IS Maigret.  Reading these mystery stories many decades ago, I was struck by the fact that atmosphere was everything.  No high speed car chases, no shootouts in the bedroom.  Maigret interacts with myriad characters relying on his experience, empathy and intuition.  Some relevant history is unearthed and the case is solved.  Sometimes a person will end up in jail, sometimes not.  Either way justice and the viewer's sense of appropriateness is served. These shows perfectly capture the stories, every character, even the most minor feels correct.  One hopes all 4 series  which I have seen on Region 2 DVD's are made available in the U.S.
Incidently, the Michael Gambon version is excellent too, but very different, far more English in its sensibility (Gambon takes the ministry stairs two at a time, Cremer seems to take them one half at a time. Cremer speaks on the phone to his wife in each episode but she almost never appears, with Gambon, the wife is often shown).
The only downside to these episodes is that, like Downton Abbey, they are very addictive.",1331856000,65,1081,4.9010989010989015
5021901,5,B006VXX8IQ,"When I first saw Maigret - after having read several of the Simenon books - I instantly recognized that the producers had captured the essence of the mysteries and had found in Bruno Cremer the perfect actor to portray the enigmatic French detective. It's a joy to see this series again in a remastered edition, especially when mysteries rely increasingly on forensics, technology & special effects to support the plot. Here, in the tradition of good old-fashioned detective work, the story is revealed through Maigret's masterful comprehension of the facts and manipulation of the people he meets, quietly assessing and judging, seemingly without sympathy. The sympathy comes from the dignity of the writing and directing, which humanely never allow the archetypal characters of post-war France from descending into cartoon representations. The stories are intriguing and the atmospheric productions are full of memorable images evocative of the time period. When Bruno Cremer died about two years ago, I felt unexpectedly sad at the loss because he was truly great as Maigret; he inhabited the character. There is a nice tribute to Bruno Cremer on the first DVD, and indeed he lives on because these lovingly produced stories stand the test of time.",1330905600,102,1251,5.2288557213930345

5021903,5,B006VXX8IQ,"Great adaptations of the original Simenon stories.  Just be aware they are in French with English subtitles.  I like these better than the Michael Gambon versions.  These are not the action type of detective story, they are more of a psychological crime drama, if that is to your taste you might enjoy these.",1499990400,,308,4.773584905660377
5021904,4,B006VXX8IQ,"Excellent portrayal of the main character and typically an excellent supporting cast.  The pacing and atmosphere from the books is captured well in this series, and generally speaking the locations fit the stories well, even if they are not the same as the novels.  The production falls down in a couple of key areas, that while Cremer basically fits the age and physical description of Maigret, his clothes and hair are often not period appropriate, nor consistent with the books.  This is true of many of the supporting characters, clothes, cars, props, etc.  So it is hard to pin down exactly when these stories are set.  They also frequently change the plots, although this is to be expected when going from the page to the screen.  Despite these sometimes confusing issues, the show is excellent and if you are a fan of the books I am sure will enjoy this series.",1494720000,,868,4.71523178807947

5021908,4,B006VXX8IQ,"These adaptations of Simenon's detective fiction, 54 in all, made for French television, vary considerably in quality and in fidelity to the original text of the stories. Some of the episodes were shot in outdoor locations and other episodes are studio productions. On the whole, the studio productions are much more stylized and theatrical in interpretation, perhaps consciously so? In some of the episodes (for example: ""Maigret Sets a Trap""), the casting leaves much to be desired, which weakens the psychological power of Maigret's solutions. Also, in the later episodes, there is a bizarre change in the way Maigret treats his subordinates at Judicial Police headquarters--he becomes much more peremptory, even nasty, which is contrary to the underlying warmth and respect for comrades exhibited by Maigret in the stories. Unfortunately, Madame Maigret is reduced to an unheard voice on the other end of the telephone in most of these adaptations. On the whole, the British series, starring Michael Gambon, has the advantage of better casting and greater attentiveness to the psychological dimension of the stories, but in some episodes the limitation imposed by their 60-minute format necessitated considerable paring down of the plot and action. Gambon's portrayal of Maigret captures the detective's stolid, brooding, impenetrable aspect more accurately than Cremer's somewhat light-hearted but fatalistic approach to the character. The British series also includes Madame Maigret in more episodes (portrayed by two different actresses), but her style of dress is more chic than Simenon intended. There will never be a perfect on-screen interpretation of Maigret because he is UNIQUE. We will get only an approximation of his indelible character.",1476316800,3,1754,5.548507462686567
5021909,5,B006VXX8IQ,"Great detective drama. Maigret is a chief inspector with heart!  The more episodes you watch, the more you like him.  You might like these even more if you read some Maigret mystery books first.",1473033600,,194,4.676470588235294

Each of us will need to adjust to the sights, odors and sounds of Paris as they differed from our individual sense of the great City's soul.

5021942,5,B006VXX8IQ,"If you came to this because you have actually read Maigret..then you will probably love it. I was wondering what all the 3-2-1-stars were about over  this series, and after reading several of each it became apparent that they were unaware of Georges Simenon, Maigret, 50's France, or that murders generally do occur over adultery and other crimes of the heart or pocket.

As most of the 5 and 4 star reviewers have mentioned, this series transfers from book to screen that dark world Maigret dissected to find the truth. Some episodes are better than others at achieving that end, but I have yet to find one that left me disappointed. Maigret moves from Paris through the countryside to dockside and back again letting us see over his shoulder a depiction of 50's France, Finland, and Belgium one might never see otherwise.

If you have never read a Maigret Mystery, take a look on YouTube for a sample episode before you spend your money. Or- visit your local library. That's where I get mine!",1428537600,,994,4.7011494252873565

5021947,5,B006VXX8IQ,"Readers who have enjoyed Georges Simenon's wonderful novels featuring his unique police inspector Maigret will be delighted with this, the first set of six feature-length adaptations.  A richly rewarding experience for those who enjoy their crime dramas solved through stylish deduction and intense character analysis, elements made famous by Simenon through his long, illustrious career.
Set in the 1950's, these episodes, beautifully and faithfully adapted from their original sources, are also a fascinating insight into post-war French city and provincial life.  The producers have created the era superbly and for people interested in the period  will be in awe of all the detailed props on display and those quaint French cars which Maigret always appears to be a very uncomfortable passenger!
I found every one of these stories engrossing and was fully involved with each as my favorite detective methodically worked his way through  the intricate plots until each met a satisfying conclusion.  Simenon would be very pleased with Bruno Cremer's excellent interpretation of his immortal character.
A few highlights to share:  Laurent Petitgirard's beautiful music scores including a fabulous theme. In ""The Headless Corpse"", Aurore Clement delivers a brilliant portrayal as the victim's wife. And ""At the Crossroads"", filmed in the Luxembourg countryside, combines a strange, complex band of characters and features more gunplay than in just about every other Maigret episode combined.
Great series!  For newcomers, the good news is that there are another eight series and they just get better and better!",1424649600,9,1611,5.551020408163265

Although the main characters are very British in voice, language, attitude, and cultural orientation, it doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the series.

Perhaps I don't like detective stories.  I sure liked The Octopus and purchased many seasons.  I watched The Spiral and loved it.  One might say I like action, instead of dialogue, but I am not an action, per se,  fan;  I do like a story, not ""Now what did you do next?"" dialog.  Maybe I should change my rating to 2 stars, but I don't want to read all the comments to my rating.",1411862400,,541,4.393939393939394
5021961,4,B006VXX8IQ,"The MHz Maigret boxed sets present the full, original 1:66:1 aspect ratio of the original broadcast series, contrary to Amazon's description and especially contrary to Arsene Lupin's comments. The transfers are NOT cropped or blown up or in any way resized from their original format.

To watch these dramas in their original aspect ratio, simply use modern video equipment. I play the discs on a Sony Blu-Ray player connected via HDMI to a Samsung plasma screen set. On the Samsung, there is a setting for picture size. When the 'screen fit' option is selected, the Maigret DVDs scale correctly to 1.66:1 aspect ratio.

To repeat: the transfers for this DVD set were done correctly and the image is NOT cropped or blown up to 1.78:1.

Not every episode is of the highest visual quality. The series was filmed in a number of locations; many episodes were shot in the Czech Republic. The mHZ Network set doesn't follow the broadcast order of the series, but that's a small nuisance. IMDB lists the original episodes with their original broadcast dates.

Avid Simenon readers might find fault with the adaptations for not following the novels more closely; Simenon's compressed style doesn't lend itself to conventional television writing. Worse, the first 19 Maigret novels were written in a white heat from 1931-1934, but the TV adaptations are set post-WWII. The series greatest strength is in Bruno Cremer's interpretation of Commissaire Jules Maigret. He embodies the character. From a 1931 novel (The Hanged Man of St-Pholien), this description:

""Maigret was tall and wide, particularly broad-shouldered, solidly built, and his run-of-the-mill clothes emphasized his peasant stockiness. His features were coarse... There was something implacable and inhuman about him.""

That heavy stillness, with the capacity to suddenly explode in a cold rage, is Cremer's great strength in the performance.",1408752000,23,1898,5.268211920529802

We enjoy the drama both for the setting and for Bruno Kremer's performance.

It's quite different from the English version with Michael Gambon, which is really a British copper show set in Paris (even though actually made in Hungary). Gambon is a fine actor and the programs are fun, but it the plots have been fiddled with more to fit a one-hour time frame versus 1 hours for the French version. One strength of the British version is the supporting cast, particularly the detectives assisting Maigret.

In the Gambon version, Maigret has a harsher attitude toward transgressors than in the Kremer version. I think the latter is closer to the novels in tone as well as plot.

The French-language version is slower moving and won't be to everyone's taste.  However, we love the atmosphere and seeing French culture and attitudes toward such things as food, smoking, drink, sex, social status, etc.  One of my favorite moments was when the detectives were questioning a suspect and asked him where he was on a certain evening. He replied that he took his wife to a particular restaurant. The next question was ""how was it?""

My high school French is starting to come back and I can tell the sub-titles are not literal translations, but an attempt to convert the dialog into English vernacular.  In this case I think it's more British vernacular than American.

5022029,5,B006VXX8IQ,"This is the third Maigret I have purchased, along with he first set. To be brief, Series 1 continues the tradition of Maigret's methodical approaches as well as the compelling viewings first and all the time. As in my other review, these discs are played on Region 1. This means you will not be able to play them unless, you have a Region 1 player (North America), or a DVD player that can play all regions. If you are in Europe, but the PAL region discs which have been out for some time now. Also, when you buy this set, there are two DVD cases which contain three discs each. It should be noted that the three discs are literally right on top of each other. If it is plausible, I recommend separating the discs, so as to prevent any scratching which after a while makes the film ""jump"" in certain spots, (as with all other discs). Again, these films are extremely worthwhile if you are looking for a detective film which is methodical and undisturbed. The ambiance of each film is extremely well made, with all the films set in post-world war II setting, which are for the most part in France.

Personally, what brought me to the Maigret series was what was aforementially said and a little more. I actually started viewing mysteries on MHz networks on my local station. I had first watched their other mysteries, such as Montalbano and, Neck, Wallander and so forth. However, in those detective mysteries, the protagonist always loses his composure, just for the sake of solving the mystery going as far as to berate his friendly allies. In another of them, the protagonist is unfaithful, even sleeping with the victim, who ends up at the end of the episode to actually kill another suspect, and have used the detective the whole time, (One of the later Montalbano episodes). The Beck and Wallander episodes are less worse, but still have many flaws. Beck is good to watch, but his violent deputy partner seems to be a running gag that gets tiring, at least to me. The Wallander episodes are OK, but if you do view them, do not get the sets with the British portrayal, or the Rolf Swedish version. The Rolf version is painful to watch, as he literally has health problems that severly hamper his detective work, in addition to health. He also gets extremely violent and always seems to be at odds with everybody in the station. In the last episode, he actually corners the main villain who has killed many people including Wallnder's family, but refuses to pull the trigger. The man laughs and runs away, while Wallander balls up and starts crying like a child. I would have to say out of these three, choose Beck, because it is the most focused of the bunch, but no as much as Maigret.

So, in conclusion. the Maigret episodes are much better, because none of the problems listed above happens at all. Their is no unfaithfulness, health problems, or mental in capacities the Maigret holds. If you have been offended, by those statements and like those aforementioned series, please do not take any offense. I just thought it would be fitting for me to state why I liked the Maigret set more, and why a select few might as well. I will most likely post this review to the Set 1. If so I am doing this to save time, so please do not mark it as spam.

5022034,2,B006VXX8IQ,"If you're a fan of Simenon's Maigret, these episodes should be fun.  You get the methodical pipe-smoking inspector dispensing justice in '50s France (actually Prague, but you won't notice if you haven't been to Paris).  You get the cars, street scenes, etc that really capture some of the novel's atmosphere.  What you don't get is a story that hangs together (unless you are familiar with the novels) and this prevents these productions (English subtitled release) from moving above 3 stars...

Screenplays based on existing novels don't necessarily have to follow the author's narrative and, for practical reasons, have to be altered for the screen.  But no matter how presented, the final screenplay should hang together.  The issue here is that several of the stories have significant plot holes or episode resolutions that don't follow the facts as presented to the viewer.  As the credits roll, the viewer is all too often left wondering what happened (ex. the murderer is allowed to go free or obvious accomplices are never brought forward).  The issues stem from the subtitles not presenting the French dialog accurately (in several key places), obvious `missing facts' left on the cutting room floor and worst of all, force-fitting a 90-minute screenplay into the novel's carefully constructed outcome.

Simenon sometimes presents a plot where justice may be at odds with the law (or associated punishment). Occasionally, Maigret ""doesn't get his man"" for the simple reason that it's not the right thing to do.  In the novels, Simenon carefully constructs Maigret's `out' and lets the criminal `get away' (or cop to a lower charge) to avoid the guillotine.  However, in the associated screen episode, the `out' occurs with minimal justification --- you see the murderer walk into the sunset.

In two episodes, there is no way the presented plot leads to the outcome depicted -- the outcome is from the novel, but the screenplay does not develop to get the viewer to that place... as the credits roll, a careful viewer is left bewildered.

Don't take my word for the screwed-up plots - in an `extra' interview (included in set 2), a director complains about inconsistencies in the screenplays. In one case, the screenplay was so screwed-up, he had to alter the ending during filming to try to make the story work.  He called the producers while shooting the final sequences and informed them he was altering the ending...

If you love the novels and the atmosphere, 4.5 stars...
If you are just looking for a good period mystery show, 2 stars.",1346112000,26,2551,5.011848341232228
8505202,5,B006VXX8IQ,"I was inspired to revisit this 1992 ITV ""Maigret"" series by viewing the network's misguided 2016 attempt that stars Rowan Atkinson as the iconic French police detective. The new episodes are dull, bloated, anachronistic, and not the least bit French. We will never know what Georges Simenon would have thought of Michael Gambon's 1992-1993 portrayal of his detective, as Simenon did not live to see it, but he heaped much praise on Rupert Davies' 1960-1963 interpretation, a BBC production. I like Michael Gambon in this role a lot, and the producers anchored the series well in French manners and urban life. Like the 1960 series, these ""Maigret"" episodes are a concise 50 minutes each. Maigret's personality and the diligence of his team of detectives come across strongly and without filler.

Chief Inspector Jules Maigret (Michael Gambon) is a gruff, even-tempered, and remarkably patient career police detective in Paris, originally from a small village. He is married to an elegant French homemaker (Ciaran Madden), and he smokes a pipe. He is assisted by a team of capable detectives: Sergeant Lucas (Geoffrey Hutchings), who is around his own age, and the younger men Inspector Janvier (Jack Galloway) and Inspector Lapointe (James Larkin). Many of the mysteries are improbable, but that is the nature of mystery novels. Maigret is a detective whom we would want on the case. He entices us to suspend disbelief. When I compare the 1992 and 2016 adaptations of Simenon's serial killer story ""Maigret Sets a Trap,"" there is no comparison.

The six episodes are:

""The Patience of Maigret"": When the 73rd smash-and-grab jewel store robbery in seven years takes place, Monsieur Comeliau (John Moffatt), the Examining Magistrate, summons Chief Inspector Maigret, who explains, ""One can't always rush these matters."" Maigret is certain that an old adversary, Manuel Palmari (Trevor Peacock), is behind the robberies but has been unable to prove it. Maigret visits the retired gangster, now a wheelchair-bound restaurateur, for a chat, where he also meets Palmari's mistress Aline Bauche (Cheryl Campbell), who is openly hostile. That very day, Palmari is murdered with his own gun. Maigret makes the rounds of the tenants in Palmari's apartment building, a veritable cross-section of the Parisian population, looking for clues.

""Maigret and the Burglar's Wife"": Maigret receives an unexpected visit at the station from a woman from his past. Mme. Ernestine Jussiaume (Sandy Ratcliff) has come to tell Maigret that her husband, Albert ""Sad Freddy"" Jussiaume, a burglar by trade, found a woman shot to death when he invaded a house with a garden in Neuilly. Freddy has fled Paris, lest he be blamed. Maigret and Inspector Lapointe (James Larkin) deduce that the home is owned by a dentist, Guillaume Serre (Christopher Benjamin), who lives with his Dutch wife Maria and his domineering mother (Margery Withers). Maria is said to be visiting family in the Netherlands. Maigret must determine if Mme. Serre is dead or alive, where she might be, and if her killer is the obvious her husband- or not.

""Maigret Goes to School"": Joseph Gastin (Struan Roger) comes to Paris from a small coastal village to see Chief Inspector Maigret. He believes he is about to be arrested for murder and seeks Maigret's help in proving himself innocent. Maigret is eager to indulge in some fresh oysters and mussels, so he decides to return with Gastin. They are met at the station by local police Captain Danielou (Adrian Lukis) who admires Maigret's work and welcomes his input on the case. Gastin is a school master and secretary of the town government, though not originally from there. Leon Bullard, the unlikable former postmistress, was shot dead by a pellet through the eye. A schoolboy, Marcel Sellier (Jamie Fletcher Lawson) claims he saw Gastin emerge from his shed with the gun.

""Maigret and the Mad Woman"": The elderly Mme. Antoine (Marjorie Summerville) insists on speaking to the Chief Inspector concerning ""a matter of life and death."" She believes she is in mortal danger because, whenever she returns from her afternoon walk, some items in her apartment have moved. Maigret promises to visit her the next day, but she is found dead, suffocated, before he gets there. Maigret believes she surprised an intruder. Mme. Antoine was twice widowed and her only family are a niece, Angele Louette (Frances Cuka), who craves her money, and Angele's son Emile (Mark Lockyer), of whom she was fond. Maigret is surprised to find gun oil in a drawer in the victim's bedroom and to find a career criminal, Marcel (Mark Frankel), in Angele's bed.

""Maigret on Home Ground"": Maigret receives a tip that a crime will take place in Church on All Saint's Day in the town where he grew up. He attends the service on All Saint's Day and observes the Countess (Agi Margitai) sitting in a pew near the front. When he speaks to her, Maigret realizes she is dead. Her priest Father Martin (Daniel Moynihan) isn't surprised, as the Countess was elderly and had a bad heart. But when Maigret finds her prayer book with a fraudulent and shocking newspaper clipping inside, he believes that she was murdered. Her secretary and lover Jean Metayer (James Clyde) is rumored to be after the Countess' money. Her profligate son Maurice (John Warnaby) is deeply in debt. Maigret is disappointed in the noble family he looked up to as a boy.

""Maigret Sets a Trap"": When a fifth woman, a mother of two young children, is stabbed to death late in the evening in Montmartre, public outcry inspires Maigret to set a trap. Without any connection between the victims, the police are at a loss for how to find this serial killer. Maigret leads the press to believe that he has made an arrest in the case, hoping to provoke the murderer by wounding his ego, while a team of policewomen move about Montmartre as bait, closely watched by plainclothes policemen. It's ""the biggest operation ever mounted for a case like this,"" and it nets a piece of cloth and a button from the attacker's suit. The trail leads to frustrated interior designer Marcel Moncin (Richard Willis), but the evidence against him is flimsy and circumstantial.",1529280000,,6187,4.994180407371484

Also, the actress playing his wife is closest to how I see and hear Mde Maigret when I read the tales.
Another part of the Cremer version that I like is the production gives a much closer feel to recreating the period of Simenon's stories.  The clothing, the sets, even the way people interact - the supporting characters - seems to ring very true for this period in time.
