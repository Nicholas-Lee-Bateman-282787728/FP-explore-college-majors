8538986,5,B009B0L4AK,"This DVD is part of the NOVA series  scienceNOW. It starts with an analysis of Einstein's brain, with the parietal lobe (math gifted), frontal lobe, motor lobe and the prefrontal cortex (music) . It examines the effect of injuries to the brain, which often has a positive effect on other regions of the brain.
Next it touches on memory.  I am not a brain scientist, but I notice that my short term memory deteriorates as I get older, while my long term memory  gets better. I forget where I put a book yesterday, but have a clear memory of things that happened 40 or 50 years ago.",1383350400,,580,4.401869158878505
8538987,4,B009B0L4AK,"David Pogue does his usual great job of narrating this investigation of the human brain that largely focuses on that of Albert Einstein. Viewers see images from sophisticated scanners, meet savants, and explore the art of memory improvement.

While the material is interesting, I suspect these external analyses will have limited impact because of the difficulty/impossibility of utilizing the knowledge learned to significantly improve human brains beyond what we already know - 'practice makes perfect' and develops specific brain areas. Much more promising is the genetic research going on now in China at the Beijing Genome Institute - hopefully combining their research with techniques for gene modification will lead us into a world with vastly improved intelligence for all.",1382140800,,781,5.563025210084033
8538988,4,B009B0L4AK,This is good general information about the current state of brain research that the casually interested person would enjoy.  A little more information as to where to go for more would have been nice.,1366416000,,199,4.852941176470588
8538989,5,B009B0L4AK,My 5th and 6th grade math students loved this DVD. I highly recommend this DVD for children and adults. It is always fun to learn something new.,1365552000,,144,4.37037037037037
8538990,5,B009B0L4AK,"This was one of the best shows yet in NOVA's outstanding ScienceNow series.  The show uses the amazing story of what happened to Einstein's brain as a vehicle to teach the viewer some fascinating things about the human brain.  Host David Pogue makes the show work.  He brings just the right blend of humor, good questions, and respect for the scientists he interviews.  I also enjoy seeing him make the scientists laugh...how often do you see a scientist laugh?  NOVA is to be congratulated.  I can't remember another show that discussed scientific topics in such an interesting way.  A 100% successful series.",1351641600,,610,4.921568627450981
8538991,1,B009B0L4AK,"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, David Pogue once again insists on making Nova all about him and not about the topic.",1351036800,2,143,3.9655172413793105
