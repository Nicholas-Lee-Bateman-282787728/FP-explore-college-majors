8092057,1,B000BT997U,One of the worst attempts at filmmaking I have ever attempted to watch. I was unable to watch more than the first few minutes. Do not waste your money or time on this.,1488585600,,167,4.090909090909091

8092059,2,B000BT997U,"This was a really terrible movie, extremely disappointing.  The director of this movie is Melvin Van Peebles, who is a very good filmmaker.  He's known for Sweet Sweetback's Badaass Song, a great, great movie.  The man is talented.  But you wouldn't recognize it here.  This film carries one of the lowest ratings in IMDB history, and I can understand why.  It's pretty awful.  It has a few scattered  laughs (very few), and Melvin's visual sense is pretty good (there are some nice compositions here and there), but it is boring and very poorly made.  Not to mention stupid.  Melvin Van Peebles's character of the police detective (who narrates the movie) is completely useless to the plot and if it was cut out, you wouldn't miss it.

Considering this was Melvin's first film after a 16 year break in directing, you'd think he had saved up all that creative energy and make a masterpiece (like Terrence Malick did with a 20 year break between Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line), but that was not to be.",1474416000,,1007,4.632768361581921
