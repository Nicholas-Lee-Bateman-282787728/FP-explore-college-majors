4579621,5,B0055SJYMW,"I don't usually buy WWE Superstar documentary sets these days, I stick to some PPVs thats about it. However Id been waiting to see a Randy Orton set for awhile so today I went to best buy and bought the Blu Ray set and Im in Awe of how good this set really is. the matchlist imo with the exception of missing his SummerSlam 2004 World Heavyweight Championship Match against Chris Benoit (we all know why) is very good but I loved this set for the Documentary part, it goes through all aspects his childhood, school years, Marine situation, early career, mid career, now. His family is on here and you get alot of good interviews with co-workers like HHH, Cena, I beleive Batista. Just a great great set, usually i ebay or trade in the newer WWE dvds these days however this set is an exception and will stay in my blu ray/dvd collection. I recommend Randy Orton the Evolution of a Predator to any WWE fan and Certainly any Randy Orton fan such as myself. In the end it's a good thing they waited until this point to make this DVD they went through his career which overshadowed events and issues he was going through in his personal life, for example when he was world champ in 2004 and could of had the world by the kahones but wasn't ""ready"" to take advantage of it, so again I beleive they waited until the right point in his life/career to make this set it feels complete. Again Great set and Enjoy.",1315267200,6,1403,4.358778625954199
4579622,5,B0055SJYMW,"Just about every review has the full content and match listing, which is what I am going to do. But they didn't include the Blu-Ray Exclusives, meaning chapters only avalible on the Blu-Ray version. I am also going to put in some matches that they should have put on the DVD. Anyway, Randy Orton has been in WWE for almost 10 years and a major main eventer for 4 years. He finally got his DVD. To be honest, they picked a good time for the DVD to be released.

4579623,5,B0055SJYMW,"This film is perfect for the fan/non fan of Randy Orton. It shows you a part of Randy that you didn't even know existed. I won't give any spoilers away since this does come out until the 6th of September, but being a huge WWE and Randy Orton fan, I was blown away by the things he talks about. The way he lets you into his personal life, with his family and his past, are just incredible. I was truly shocked to know things about him, things that I never even thought he went through. His story is one of the best I've ever heard. After watching this, you'll understand why it is called The Evolution of, I thought it had to do with the old group Evolution, but in reality, it shows how much Randy has changed from being a young boy, to being at the top of WWE.",1314662400,2,761,4.08
4579624,5,B0055SJYMW,"Finally Orton gets his own dvd have it pre-ordered and cannot wait to get it. A little upset his WHC victory with Benoit isn't on their cause that was his first official major title win, and got him on the map. I understand though how WWE has distanced themself from that quite a bit, can't say I'm proud of it, they shouldn't pretend like he never existed, but thats another argument. Looks great and I cannot wait to get it. Counting down to the 6th begins!!!",1314057600,,461,4.372093023255814

4579626,5,B0055SJYMW,"Now while this DVD is missing some other matches, one major match that is missing from it is of course his first World Title. This was pretty much the reason why they've taken so long to release an Orton DVD, but to still not include the match is beyond me. It seems pretty stupid at this point for WWE to leave that match out, everybody knows what happened with the Benoit incident, and everyone has pretty much since moved passed it. Now as far as the match is concerned I doubt they will ever release a DVD featuring that match, but this DVD right here sounds pretty awesome, and it looks like it can really be a top wrestling DVD, but without that match, it will always have that ""one thing missing"" factor.

As far as the rest of the DVD is concerned, it shapes up to be really awesome, a quality DVD for the real Orton fan. I just hope they don't adjust that Orton vs Foley match and go black and white when they start bleeding. It would just ruin it for me.",1309824000,5,964,4.210810810810811
4579627,2,B0055SJYMW,"Look the match list seems alright, but I do believe they are missing his first ever world title win. I know they don't wanna have stuff with ""he who shall not be named"", but that was a career defining match for Orton. Without that clean victory over one of the best they would have never gotten Orton to where he is today. Heck they had him in the Nitro DVD, he should be on this one.",1309564800,2,384,4.065789473684211
4579628,5,B0055SJYMW,It's about time Orton got a dvd set I mean it has been almost two years since they released a set on Batista and Cena.  I mean Orton is right up there with them as the new generation for the wwe although Batista is no longer around.  The match selection is a good choice although I think they should have included his match with the Taker at Wrestlemania.  I also noticed that they didn't include his matches with Shawn Michaels after Michaels was injured and also his matches with Jericho when Jericho returned from his music thing.  I'm also happy they aren't including his matches with Wade Barrett or the nexus thing.,1309132800,,621,4.517857142857143

Overall, Orton has probably the most exciting finishers in wrestling today. I loved his legdend killer gimmick but the last few years Orton has been a complete bore. However, i'd still like to see the documentary over Orton. The matches have been mostly seen before but at least you'll have it all in one place. The only match missing is Benoit for obvious reasons. Looks like a cant miss set.",1308960000,2,2378,4.6594724220623505

4579662,5,B0055SJYMW,Great story on Randy Orton and most of his best matches are included also,1422316800,,73,4.285714285714286
4579663,5,B0055SJYMW,I've always been a big fan of Randy Orton. This dvd is perfect!,1418860800,,63,3.923076923076923
4579664,5,B0055SJYMW,The item arrived early and everything works very well.,1416182400,,54,5.111111111111111
4579665,5,B0055SJYMW,"I'm a huge WWE fan. I've been watching since 2004, and I was an Orton fan bavk then, so I thought I'd buy this, plus I don't totally HATE Randy... But now I'm a huge Orton fan. I found out a lot about him. It's really deep and kinda sad, and it's cool to see how he changed and got more together. I recommend this to ANY WWE fan! If you like Orton and don't have this, It's worth it.",1412467200,,383,3.8
4579666,3,B0055SJYMW,"I'd start off by saying the documentary was great. I think all wrestling fans will love it along with Orton fans. And secondly I consider this a must purchase for any wrestling fan or Randy Orton fan. The prices for this dvd is low currently and a great deal. I found the matches on this set to be lacking there are a lot of good ones but this set could have been better.

  The Orton Beniot match would never make it on there but I felt that really cemented Orton as the next Mega Star in WWE. Great match. The Wrestlemania match with Taker is missing. That should be on here. Bragging Rights 2009 vs John Cena should be on here. No Mercy 07 vs Triple H should be on here. Backlash 2007 was good also. Summerslam 11 or Over the Limit with Christian should be on here. Summerslam vs Taker should be on here.

  Going through the matches they selected. Mick Foley was a good selection it was a big match for Orton moving forward with his career. His match with Shawn Michaels was good too. CM Punk match was the best match on the dvd. I liked seeing Slam 06 with Orton against Hulk but that wasn't a classic match by all means. The match with RVD was good. The match selection wasn't that bad but there was too much filler.

  In the end if you are paying only five to six bucks you get an awesome documentary with five or six great matches and the rest so so I say go for it's well worth the money!!!  Cheers!!!",1411084800,2,1411,4.173431734317343

4579699,5,B0055SJYMW,"I bought this because Randy Orton is 6'5"" of solid man meat. I'm not interested in the documentary--only watching him sweaty and wearing next to no clothes for hours on end in high def.",1386979200,,185,4.470588235294118
4579700,5,B0055SJYMW,Randy Orton is one of the best wrestlers.  He is a soon to be in the hall of fame.  This takes you back way way back to the early when he was in the the army all the way wanting to be a wrestler all the way to his personal life with his now ex-wife and daughter.  Great documentary even if u are not a wrestling fan.,1381190400,,316,3.6865671641791047

4579729,4,B0055SJYMW,"Great DVD set for a sure future HOF'er... but a slight problem...

I know Vince has gone on this tirade to outlaw everything ""Chris Benoit"", but Randy Orton defeating Chris Benoit at SummerSlam 2004 is essential to the career The Viper.

I'm upset about what Benoit did, just as much as the next person.  But he shouldn't be erased from the WWE archives, and that vital turning point in Randy Orton's career should not be erased.",1336089600,3,429,4.618421052631579
4579730,4,B0055SJYMW,"The documentary part of the dvd (1st disc) really is 2 videos in one, and it's spliced together and it was a little confusing at times. I tried to seperate it, one video being Orton's story (which was 10 times more interesting than I thought it was going to be) and the Randy Orton Experience (similar to the John Cena Experience, which is what this dvd was originally intended to be).

Just a little comment, but great dvd",1335052800,,423,4.423076923076923
4579731,3,B0055SJYMW,"The Legend Killer, The Youngest Champion in WWE History, The Viper, The Apex Predator, whatever you want to call him Randy Orton has certainly become one of the most popular and polarizing figures in pro wrestling. This is his story and it is an interesting one to say the least, the biography shifts from Orton on the road to Wrestlemania 27 to him reflecting on his career from humble beginnings to his ascention to the main event level he is at today.

Whats great about this bio is the honesty by everyone interviewed and even Randy himself who admits he was cocky and let a lot of stuff go to his head early on and during his first few years in his career. I found this personally very refreshing and really gave me a new found respect for how much Orton has evolved as an in ring competitor and as a person.

The parts where he talks about his relationship with his father growing up during his dad's career and how that made him want to make time for his own family no matter how hectic his schedule is. The part where he talked about his time in the military was both good and a tad disturbing. The flow of the bio from current events to reflecting on his career was very smooth and makes this easy viewing for any wrestling fan.

Disc 2-Matches

-1/31/01, OVW Christmas Chaos, vs. Slick Robbie D: Grainy video here and not really much of note here, Orton hits a nice Wheelbarrow Suplex but only for two. Randy takes some punishment, makes a comeback and hits a full nelson slam and covers for three. 3/10.

-4/25/02, Smackdown, vs. Hardcore Holly: In his debut match Randy was able to hold his own against the veteran Holly, hitting some good arm drags and a facebuster. But Holly came back and started beating down Orton, but after Holly missed a clothesline, Randy hits an Oklahoma roll and pins Holly for three. 5/10.

-9/21/03, Unforgiven, w/Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels: Good rookie vs. veteran match here, Shawn does display good mat wrestling early on that frustrates Randy and a bit later hits a crossbody to the outside. Orton finally gains the advantage and targets the arm and shoulder, with hammerlocks, arm bars and an arm breaker. There's the expected HBK comeback, he goes for Sweet Chin Music but Orton counters into the RKO but only for two. He finally hits Sweet Chin Music, covers for three, but Flair puts Randy's foot on the bottom rope behind the refs back. While the ref was distracted by Ric, Orton uses some brass knucks to knock Shawn out and win. 6/10.

-12/14/03, Armageddon, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, w/Ric Flair vs. Rob Van Dam (Champion) w/Special Guest Referee Mick Foley:  Not a bad one here with RVD hitting his unique offense, sets of kicks to throw Orton off his game, even hitting a nice cannonball dive to the outside. Randy was finally able to gain the advantage shoving RVD off the top rope into the barricade, then he grounded the high flyer working over the neck and throat of RVD. There's a comeback by RVD hitting a kick to Orton who was on the barricade, interference from Ric Flair led to Randy hitting the RKO and he covered to win. 7/10.

-3/14/04, Wrestlemania XX, 2 on 3 Handicap Tag Team Match, w/Ric Flair and Batista vs. Rock N' Sock Connection: After Orton had spit in Foley's face and punted him down some stairs, Foley made a return at the Royal Rumble and eliminated Orton. Now we have this match and its a good encounter, nice to see Rock back in the ring too. Rock and Flair have a good face/off with Rock even mocking Ric's strut. The match does end suddenly when Orton hits an RKO on Foley out of nowhere for the win. 7/10.

-4/18/04, Backlash, No Holds Barred Falls Count Anywhere Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, vs. Mick Foley: This was the match that showed a different side of Orton and really showed that he could deliver in a main event match. Its an intense hardcore contest where both men have a good showing and Foley does for Randy what he did for Triple H in early 2000. Lots of weapons are used, a barbwire bat, barbwire board, chairs and of course thumbtacks, which leads to a memorable spot with Foley countering the RKO and Orton goes back first into the tacks. It ends with Randy hitting a sudden RKO and covering Foley to win. 10/10.

-7/11/04, Vengeance, WWE Intercontinental Championship, vs. Edge: For weeks Edge had gone after members of Evolution in an effort to get to Randy to take his title and he got his chance in this match. Its a good match though it has been praised a tad too much in my opinion, however these two worked very well together. The momentum swing back and forth and the long 20+ running time does offer the chance for them both to tell a good story with Edge overcoming the odds and the final few minutes were great as the trade finishers with Edge hitting the spear and covering to win the I.C. title. 8/10.

-10/9/05, No Mercy, Handicap Casket Match, w/Bob Orton vs. The Undertaker: This was during the long running '05 feud between Randy and Taker, shortly before Randy's dad Bob Orton was brought in and this isn't too bad of a match but its a typical handicap contest. Taker singled out each guy and beat them up while both Ortons used dirty tactics to gain the advantage on several occasions. There's the expected spots where each guy get put in the casket but fights out, at the end Taker and Randy fight in the casket, Randy hits him with a chair a couple of times and shuts the lid to win. 7/10. The aftermath sees the Ortons roll the casket to the stage, chop a hole in the top and use gas to set it on fire.

Disc 3

-6/25/06, Vengeance, vs. Kurt Angle: After suffering a defeat two weeks prior at One Night Stand, the Legend Killer looked to even the score against Angle. This wasn't as good as their previous match, but it had some good back and forth offense, Angle tries german suplexing Randy off the ring apron, but then hit one on the ring mat right after. After a thumb to the eye, Angle is thrown to the outside and driven into the barricade, then Orton takes over wearing down Kurt with a rear chin lock. Angle comes back with a huge throw off the top, Randy takes off the turnbuckle pad but gets 8 german suplexes and falls to the outside. The ankle lock is locked on, Randy counters, Kurt goes into the exposed turnbuckle, then gets the RKO, Orton covers to win. 6/10. Side note: Strange looking back that this was Kurt's final WWE PPV match.

-8/20/06, Summerslam, Legend Killer vs. Legend, vs. Hulk Hogan: A month or so prior to this Randy had RKO'd Hulk onto a car hood, so we now have this match that is much like Hogan/HBK from the previous years Summerslam in which Randy sold like crazy to make Hulk look unstoppable. It wasn't a very good match though as Hogan could only do so much given that he was at the end of his career, however Randy does target Hulk's bad knee pounding away at it. The match of course ends with Hogan hitting the big boot and legdrop to beat the Legend Killer. 4/10. Side note: While the crowd was pro-Hogan by a landslide there were some loud boos directed at Hulk as well as Orton. Also strange how Randy had the last WWE matches of Kurt Angle and Hulk Hogan within a couple months of each other.

-7/22/07, Great American Bash, Texas Bullrope Match, vs. Dusty Rhodes: Given that Dusty hadn't wrestled in forever this wasn't a horrible contest, but still not good. Dusty had the crowd in the palm of his hand and got in some good shots, including using the rope to hit a lowblow. Randy does gain the edge, targeting the knee then slapping on a sleeper hold, Rhodes does make a comeback, but Orton ends up hitting Dusty with the cowbell and covers him to win. 3/10.

-3/30/08, Wrestlemania XXIV, Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship, vs. Triple H vs. John Cena: I will admit that was a cool entrance by Cena and the match was actually good considering a Triple Threat is hard to pull off. There were some cool spots, unexpected submission moves and some good brawling. Cena tries twice to get Orton to tap out to the STFU, Triple H even uses the crossface on Cena to try to get him to submit. Triple H hits the pedigree on Cena, makes the cover, but Orton runs in, punts Triple H and Orton covers Cena to retain his title. 8/10.

-9/13/09, Breaking Point, I Quit Match for the WWE Championship, vs. John Cena: After the controversial ending to their Summerslam match the month prior, we have this contest where the stipulations are no one can interfere on Orton's behalf or he will be stripped of the title. The main story here was how much punishment could Cena take as Randy was bound and determined to make Cena say ""I Quit"", Orton used many weapons including a singapore cane with Cena handcuffed to the top rope. After getting beat up on for seemingly forever, Cena of course makes his comeback handcuffing himself to Orton and slamming him in and out of the ring. Randy hits the RKO, goes for the handcuff key but gets locked in the STF using the handcuffs to make Orton say ""I Quit"". 6/10, cause of the rushed finish.

-10/3/10, Hell In A Cell, Hell In A Cell Match for the WWE Championship, vs. Sheamus (Champion): This was a rivalry I just never got into, while both are good workers they just never fully clicked in any of their matches. That being said it was a good contest here but hardly a memorable HIAC match, Sheamus did well for this being his first time in the cell. Randy of course got in some good moves and some weapons were brought out, among them some steel steps that lead to the finish of Orton hitting an RKO onto the steel steps and covering to win. 7/10.

-4/3/11, Wrestlemania XXVII, vs. C.M. Punk: Great build-up and a good paced match, Punk is perfect as a heel (best decision WWE has ever made in recent memory regarding a character) and Orton is great as well. Both men pull off great moves, Punk focused on Orton's leg with moves like an Indian Death Lock and a Figure Four on the ring post on Orton. Orton also sold the leg injury well. The match was well done even if the finish was totally obvious as Punk sprung off the top rope towards Orton and Orton hit an RKO for the win. 8/10.

-5/6/11, Smackdown, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. Christian (Champion): Just a few days after winning the title in a ladder match, Christian faced off against the Viper in what was easily a great match and really set the stage for their upcoming long standing rivalry. Christian was hot early on, but after a missed spalsh Orton took over targeting the back slamming him into the turnbuckle. Christian comes back and takes it to Randy but can't keep him down for three, even after a high crossbody and a diving reverse elbow. Christian goes for the Killswitch, Orton counters then Christian jumps off the second rope into an RKO and after a three count we have a new World Champion. 8/10.

-The Evolution of Randy Orton's Tattoos: We hear from Randy on what his tattoos mean and what are his favorites.

-1/25/09, Royal Rumble, The Royal Rumble Match: Maybe its just me but while its a good Rumble its not one of the most memorable one, though Santino's 1 second elimination is a funny moment. One surprise entrant was RVD who got a huge reaction from the crowd and had a good showing, entering at #7 Triple H also did well here too. Once Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase and Randy Orton entered the Rumble it became pretty obvious especially when it came down to the final few who would win. Randy Orton ends up winning this Rumble to go onto Wrestlemania. 8/10.

-6/28/09, The Bash, Three Stages of Hell Match for the WWE Championship, (Singles Match, Falls Count Anywhere Match & Stretcher Match) vs. Triple H: These two had a Last Man Standing Match just a few days prior on Raw that really took a lot out of both men. The singles match has a bit of good action, Orton targeted the injured leg of Trips slamming it into the ring post, Trips does end up hitting Randy with a chair to cause a DQ so he's down 1-0. Trips continues the assault smashing the chair into Orton multiple times then hits a pedigree on the outside and covers to win so its 1-1 and a mere 6 minutes have gone by.

Its time for the Stretcher portion which is decent, both make good use of the stretcher and battle all over the arena, into the crowd and the fans are cheering big for Trips to take the title. Both guys really do take it to each other using weapons like the steel steps and others to inflict more pain, Trips looks to have it won but Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase stop the stretcher from crossing the line and beat Trips down. He fights back and grabs his sledgehammer but hits him with part of the stage and pushes the stretcher across the line to win. 6/10.

-5/22/11, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. Christian: Christian lost the title mere days after winning it at Extreme Rules, so here we have the rematch. Christian got a big reaction, while Orton got a somewhat mixed one and from a wrestling standpoint this saved the PPV and had the crowd on its feets throughout the whole thing. Both guys went all out, plenty of near falls including one where Christian hit a spear and Orton barely kicked out. Orton reversed the Killswitch and hit the RKO to retain his title. 9/10.

The bio could've been longer, it clocks in at 95 minutes or so. For the most part it was very insightful and again very refreshing to see the ins and outs of a wrestlers life. Some of the matches are good, though the Hogan and Dusty ones and a few others could've been replaced with better ones. Its worth having in your collection if you're a big Orton fan, but if you aren't it's likely one you'll watch once then put away for a good while.",1332028800,,13686,4.457051538154215

4579735,2,B0055SJYMW,this dvd could be good but they leave out how he put wwe to the top it was evolution. he was taught by the greatest of all time ric flair and the best of randy orton was when he first arrived.  The legend killer was an old school character from the 1980's when everyone could wrestle in the business. thats how he became so popular so quickly. the reason they leave it out is because they do not want the people to see how bad wrestling is again. now that his contract is up maybe he'll go to tna wrestling where he belongs. his character stinks now waiting to put the rko it was so much better when it came out of nowhere like the diamond cutter randy orton sold out was on the right path until he started fighting cena and the other scrubs. this dvd is horrible what made randy orton was him being old school evolution after ric flair left wwe destroyed orton and this dvd shows the downslide of a promising career of a great wrestler not know.,1326153600,,946,4.197802197802198

4579759,5,B0055SJYMW,"In what has been an already storied career, Randy Orton continues to ""entertain"" his fans with every RKO he hits. The thought that he's been in the WWE for nearly 10 years and this is his first DVD of any kind is ridiculous, but they make up for it with this very candid and emotional story of Randy Orton, the man! As WWE cameras take you on his journey on The Road To Wrestlemania 27, where he defeated C M Punk, we are deviated back to his childhood and his growing pains. Orton and his wife, Samantha talk about dating, marriage and family while they also give an emotional depiction of his drug use that nearly took the life of The Viper. This is a must own if your a Randy Orton fan. If you love the WWE then it will be a good addition to your library. This is what WWE needs to do for now on with the WWE network coming in 2012 and this DVD will be perfect for that. The matches are great, but the omission of his first WHC win over Chris Benoit was unfortunate as well as lack of focus on that. He's the youngest champion ever and they barely touch it, but hey it's still over 7 hours of just Randy Orton and that's all this viewer cared about!",1317254400,,1152,4.101769911504425
4579760,4,B0055SJYMW,"In what has been a banner year for Randy Orton in the ring, 2011 comes close to a...close...with his first documentary/match collection. Where most WWE productions have been filmed in chronological order in the style of a TV news piece, Orton's deviates by using the build to WrestleMania against CM Punk as a framing device for his career, all while filmed as more of a feature film presentation. While the parts of the film sticking strictly to his early career and life, and the troubles within both, are well done, the ancillary aspects detract more than add. Using the feud with CM Punk as a narrative thread doesn't work because very little of what actually happens during that feud is explained. Further, while Orton's backstage interactions with other wrestlers (including a ""heel"" Vickie Guerrero) are real, Orton and the narrator still plays the entire Punk feud as ""real"", creating a bizarre contradiction between story and sight.

Similarly, a good portion of the documentary is spent usually promoting, glorifying, or exploring certain aspects of WWE and the business as a whole that have no need to be here. Why do we need to talk about Shawn Michaels heading into the Hall of Fame? Or WrestleMania FanAxxes? These occurrences suggest that they didn't have enough content to make a 90 minute film. Which is somewhat true: there's a decent amount of this DVD of people stating just how immature Orton was before he and his wife had a child, which seemed to turn his attitude around. Yet we don't get very many examples of how this attitude actually hurt him and the rest of his peers.

It's really at the final 30 minutes when the documentary picks up, around the time when Orton goes into details about his attempted suicide. The heart of the film, especially from his wife, is revealed. Similarly, tales of Orton going AWOL from the military, his start in WWE's then-development camp OVW, and interactions with Evolution are intriguing, but they come a bit too sparingly.

Had this documentary been trimmed by about 15 minutes or so, it would have benefited greatly. It's by no means bad, and I still recommend it, but there's a persistent sense that the documentary wants to sidestep too often for fear of the quality of the subject matter.

The matches I will not get into for brevity's sake, but I will state that in my opinion, his match with CM Punk at WrestleMania 27 was easily the best match on the show (go figure, with this documentary) and one of the best matches either guy has had in their respective WWE tenures. Save that match for last, as the rest of the matches here are well chosen.",1317168000,,2616,4.742857142857143
4579761,4,B0055SJYMW,"The documentary is ~90 minutes and goes in cycles.  It'll cover a segment of the feud with CM Punk from early this year, than jump to a personal issue Randy talks about, than jump to talking about a career milestone and keeps repeating like that until the end.

What makes this documentary is how open Randy Orton is when speaking about all the negative issues that he's had in his life.  These include going AWOL while serving in the Marines (Orton explains his reasons for going in and going AWOL), being an immature jerk backstage (you get a definite affirmation of that from John Cena), and a drug addiction which lead to an over dose that almost took his life (his wife speaks about Randy in that phase of his life in a very touching interview.)

There are also a lot of ""off tv"" footage that's pretty cool.  Stuff like choosing which color of trunks to wear before a match, going to media appearances, hanging out at home and backstage at RAW with his family, rehearsing his WM27 entrance etc... kind of reminded me of the the  backstage WM9 moments they showed on ""the true story of wrestlemania"" dvd.

As for negatives, there is a bit of WWE fluff, but that's to be expected.  The CM Punk/Orton feud is covered with Kayfabe maintained so they're talked about like they're mortal enemies.  You'll hear ""WWE Universe"" a lot.  There's a segment where Orton tells the story of wanting to enter pro wrestling and approaching his dad in 1999 with the question ""Do you think I can become a WWE superstar?"" It just sounds so scripted with ""wwe superstar"" in there instead of ""wrestler.""

Career wise the major points are covered: OVW, Smackdown debut, joining evolution, and winning his first world title at the 2004 Summerslam from Chris Benoit.  Benoit is completely censored.  I can understand why WWE does it but it causes the segment to be weird because all you see are close-ups of Orton never knowing who his opponent was.

After that the doc kind of jumps to the Legacy portion of Orton's career and interviews with Cody and Ted talking about Randy as a mentor.  This is a good overview but I felt like they skipped over a lot of key periods in Orton's career, mainly...
* Legend killer gimmick (mentioned very briefly but rushed through)
* IC title reign in 2004 & his first great match against Foley at Backlash `04
* 2005: working with his dad and feud with Undertaker
* 2006: first wrestlemania world title match at WM22 & working against Hogan at summerslam.
* 2007: Rated RKO with Edge, winning the WWE title at No Mercy and starting the change from legend killer to the
  viper character.

I won't comment on the matches since match listings are never perfect, but even if you're not a Randy Orton fan the documentary is a must see.",1316995200,,2747,4.58282208588957
4579762,4,B0055SJYMW,"Personally I'm not that big a fan of Orton, but this Dvd collection is really good. I couldn't help but think what if the wwe had put this much effort into some of their other projects mainly WCW themed ones. Very good production work. Hopefully they will continue this pattern for future releases...like the upcoming Austin set or even the Hart Micheals Rivalry Set. My only real gripe with this is no Benoit but come on Randys first World title win was against Benoit, pinned him cleanly to win the title. If they can finally show him on the Elimantion Chamber DVD, they could have shown him on here too, oh well!!!!",1316304000,2,618,4.526785714285714

I haven't actually watched the movie yet just opened it yesterday and saw it was only 2 disks not 3.,1315785600,,269,4.09433962264151
4579764,5,B0055SJYMW,"I've personally been waiting on a Randy Orton documentary for years, but I'm glad they waited until now.  This allows the fans to see Orton's progression and ""evolution"" (no pun intended) over the last decade.  It tells a story of a kid who had the skills to be one of the best, but was ultimately held back by his own immaturity.  It's interesting to see Randy during the good times, the bad times, and everything in between.

The presentation reminds me of the latest Jeff Hardy WWE DVD, where they keep going back and forth from the present time (in this case, Randy's preparation for his WrestleMania 27 showdown with CM Punk) to the past.  There's a ton of good stuff here, including Randy speaking candidly about his past and the various problems he had with drugs, his attitude, etc.  It makes you realize how far he's come, and how he is truly a different person now.  The story almost reminded me of Shawn Michaels.

The matches are worth the price of admission alone.  I always knew Randy Orton was one of the most talented superstars on the roster, but this DVD proves that he can pull a good match out of almost anyone.  I really didn't notice any throwaway matches at all.  Even when Randy was still considered a rookie, he was putting on 5-star matches with HBK, RVD, and Mick Foley.

Overall, I would recommend this DVD to any WWE fan, regardless of what you think about Orton.  The documentary and matches could honestly change your opinion.",1315440000,2,1457,4.579150579150579
4579765,4,B0055SJYMW,"The youngest World Champion in history...The Legend Killer...The Viper. So many alias go along with the third generation wrestler known as Randy Orton & here is WWE telling his story on his own DVD with additional comments from others like his farther Bob Orton jr, Arn Anderson, John Cena, Triple H, Batista, his wife Samantha, Cody Rhodes, Ted Dibiase, and Sheamus.

The documentary is setup differently than the usual sit-down interview about his career type that we normally get as it's similar to how Jeff Hardy's ""My Life, My Rules"" or similar Steve Austin's ""Hell Yeah!"" where it's based around following him with a behind the scenes look at him during a certain time period while also telling his story.  It was the period between the Elimination Chamber & WrestleMania 27 PPV's in this case where we saw Orton on the road, backstage at events, at home with his family, and doing promotional work (radio, Axxess, ect.) while Orton recalls various flashbacks in his career.  Orton beings to talk about how he was interested in getting into the business back in 1999 leading to going to OVW developmental territory the same time John Cena & Batista & Brock Lesnar were there along with him having a cocky arrogant attitude that makes Orton himself admit that he was an ""jerk.""  This run in Evolution was discussed from how he was handpicked by Flair & Triple H leading to backstage jealously regarding his spot on the roster before talking about how his own bad attitude got in the way of his success.  His successful run as the Legend Killer leading to becoming the youngest World Champion in history was discussed before going back in time to tell the story about how he didn't didn't originally want to follow in his dad's footsteps & the story behind Orton going A.W.O.L. from the military.  Orton's drug problem was discussed in heavy detail next from his suspension to what was the one thing that made him turn his life around & how he incorporates elements of this period into his current ""Viper"" character before going into his run with Dibiase & Rhodes in ""Legacy"" to being seen as a locker room leader close out the documentary.

Matches Include
vs. Slick Robbie D - The video quality here wasn't much as OVW was pretty low budget but it was a quick match to showcase Orton at the beginning of his career.
""OVW Christmas Chaos"" Jan. '01

vs. Hardcore Holly - This was Orton's WWE television debut that was pretty short & sweet but very impressive for a first showing.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '02
[Best Of Smackdown: 10th Anniversary]

vs. Shawn Michaels - The was the Orton's first singles PPV match & the beginning of Orton's run as ""The Legend Killer.""  Orton kept getting shown up by Shawn in the beginning causing Orton to attempt to do it himself at one point with his own version of ""skin the cat"" to get an advantage only for Shawn to return it & gain the momentum back.  Shawn ended up hurting his shoulder by hitting the post causing Ric Flair to get his shots in on the outside while Orton also used the ringpost along with working over Shawn's arm with hammerlocks, armbars, and even a single arm DDT.  Both men went back & forth with Flair constantly trying to get involved only for Shawn to keep knock him down but unfortunately not out as Flair would get involved towards the end causing a bit of confusion which Orton was able to capitalize on.
Unforgiven '03

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion vs. Rob Van Dam - Mick Foley was not only the special referee in this match but also the co-General Manager at this time while also having his personal issues with Orton dating back months earlier when Orton attacked Foley at Madison Square Garden.  RVD was in control during the first half of the match before he ""crashed & burned"" with a high risk move on the outside for Orton to gain control.  Orton grounded RVD with moves like a side headlock before they began to trade momentum with impactful moves like RVD's spinning kick onto Orton on the ringside barrier while Orton later gave a DDT with RVD hanging off the middle ropes.  This was a good match that got more competitive overtime.
Armageddon '03

w/Evolution (Ric Flair & Batista) vs. The Rock & Sock Connection (The Rock & Mick Foley) - This was The Rock's first match in almost a year while Foley's first in over 4 years.  This was just a fun handicap tag match that's not easy to summarize more than to just sit back & watch unfold as everyone here had their moments to look strong as Foley looked like he didn't miss a step, Batista heavily showcased his power, and the biggest highlight being the interaction between Flair & Rock to the point where both men were trading each other's taunts like Flair doing the people's elbow & Rock doing Flair's strut.
WrestleMania XX

WWE Intercontinental/Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Mick Foley - Foley came out under his ""Cactus Jack"" persona & tried to nail Orton with ""Barbie"" right away with Orton running for his life before Orton was able to took nail Mick with a trash can to the face multiple times before Orton eventually ended up taking one himself.  They took the fight to the ramp where Foley was back suplexed before going back into the ring where more weapons came into play causing Foley to ask the fans if they wanted him to use either ""Socko"" or ""Barbie"" on Orton.  Foley got more violent as he used ""Barbie"" to bust Orton open along with using that to give him a legdrop to the groin.  Barbed wire boards, cookie sheets, thumbtacks were all used here along with a moment where Orton was thrown off the stage followed by the classic Cactus Jack elbow drop off the stage onto Orton.  Foley in this match did what he did for Triple H in 2000 as he heavily put Orton over in his hardcore environment & showed that he can take some serious punishment that most wrestlers can't & still go while telling a good story in the ring as well.
Backlash '04
[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses: Hardcore Edition]

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Edge - Years before the thought of ""Rated RKO,"" Edge was on a mission to take out Randy Orton & end the longest I.C. title reign in over 7 years. This match had some dull moments (2-3 min. headlocks by Orton) but went back & forth between both guys with an interesting note here being how the fans were divided as half were cheering for Edge while half were getting behind Randy Orton despite being a heel in Evolution.
Vengeance '04
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence & History Of I.C. Title]

Casket Match w/Bob Orton vs. Undertaker - As expected in a handicap match situation, the Orton's kept trying to corner & double team Taker while Taker's strategy was to hit & move when both of them were. Taker was able to focus on one man when the other was out of the way for a few moments such as using a chair on Randy while choking out Bob with the triangle choke. Bob resorted to desperate tactics like using a fire extinguisher to blind Taker while Orton was able to knock Taker out with a chair for a victory but it was the aftermath of the match that made the strongest impression on everyone.
No Mercy '05
[Undertaker's Deadliest Matches]

vs. Kurt Angle - This was a rematch from the ECW One Night Stand PPV weeks earlier & for those who don't remember, Kurt Angle was part of the ECW brand during this time with WWE treating it as a separate promotion from WWE causing various biased commentary against Angle & ECW from Jerry Lawler causing Jim Ross to even get caught up in it from time to time.  Angle outwrestled Orton early to the point where he almost delivered a german suplex from the apron to the floor before eventually just doing it on the floor.  Orton attempted to ground Angle with his chinlocks & side headlocks but Angle kept coming with his various suplexes including one off the top rope, repeated belly to belly suplexes, and eight german suplexes in a row.  Good match in their series that went throughout the year.
Vengeance '06

vs. Hulk Hogan - There really isn't much to say here except this was the typical performance you would get from Hulk Hogan at this ""attraction"" stage of his career in that he was dominate for a majority of the match with Orton getting somewhat of an advantage by going after Hogan's bad leg for a while & even nailing the RKO at one point but you knew exactly what was going to happen afterwords & who was going to win so this match wasn't much but the politics behind this match (and last year's SummerSlam) also showcase why you hadn't see Hogan wrestle a match or really done much business with WWE since.
SummerSlam '06

Texas Bull Rope Match vs. Dusty Rhodes - This was a very short match that served it's purpose in that Randy Orton beat another legend...in this case, the legend who created the event itself. Besides that & Cody Rhodes appearance after the match, nothing noteworthy here.
The Great American Bash '07

WWE Championship Match vs. Triple H vs. John Cena - Before I get started, I liked Cena's entrance with the college band playing his entrance music. Well, this was the shocker of the night considering the winner of the match was the person nobody expected just based off 92% of WWE's own poll & a majority the comments in the reviews of Royal Rumble & No Way Out on Amazon itself. As for the match itself, it was your typical triple threat match in which it was non-stop action with each man having their moments at various times along with the various moments of one man stopping another from winning the match before Orton got the biggest win in his championship reign...and for those trivia fans who like to keep score of this type of thing, this was Cena's first WrestleMania loss & the fourth time a heel has walked out of WrestleMania a World Champion.
WrestleMania XXIV

WWE Championship/""I Quit"" Match vs. John Cena - Due to what happened at SummerSlam, the stipulation here was that Orton will lose the title if anyone get involved. This is one of those matches that's more about ""putting over a character"" more than actual wrestling quality because the actual physical part of the match itself (haven't seen their matches past this PPV) ranks below their previous two SummerSlam matches but above their other two PPV matches that were also setup to just further a storyline. This match heavily showcased Orton's ""Viper"" character as being cold hearted & calculating & merciless by just attacking Cena's head with the hanging DDT and weapons like a monitor & steel chair & the steps. Orton also at one point had Cena handcuffed and just beating the hell out of him & so obsessed with having Cena say ""I Quit"" that he even refused to allow Cena to ""get out easy"" & passout from the pain while Cena's character was pushed here too as he just kept taking a beating but refused to quit. I'll give credit in that I thought it was a creative way of applying the STF but the finish just came too quick to be believable. In the end, you have to look at this match for what it was in that it was more of a ""character driven"" match more than anything else.
Breaking Point '09
[Best PPV Matches 2009-2010]

WWE Championship/Hell in a Cell Match vs. Sheamus - With their previous matches (Royal Rumble & SummerSlam) not having a clear winner due to disqualifications, this final encounter would determine a clear winner. The match got taken to the outside early with Orton being able to avoid Sheamus' attempt into using steel steps then ramming his back into the cell twice & using the steps on Sheamus himself before Orton ended up feeling the cell himself with Sheamus delivering a shoulderblock that knocked him off the apron into the cell. Sheamus targeted Orton's ribs including dropping him on the steel steps right on his ribs & even countering an attempted RKO with a knee into the ribs. Orton was able to recover with powerslaming Sheamus onto the steel steps & executing the hanging DDT from the apron onto the floor while Sheamus again focused on Orton's ribs using a chair & hitting Orton twice with the Crow Kick. Sheamus attempted a High Cross on the steps but Orton was able to counter with an RKO on the steel steps to finally prove he was the better man in what was definitely the best match in their series.
Hell In A Cell '10

vs. C.M. Punk - Orton came into this match with an injured leg & Punk focused directly on it with various stomps, even kicked the steps into his leg when Orton was chasing him on the outside, a modified indian deathlock, and even doing a top rope kneedrop onto Orton who was hanging from a tree of woe. This injury did effect Orton to the point where he wasn't able to push off his legs when Punk had the anaconda vice & even was able to do his punt. Orton was on the defense for most of the match but was able to get offense including an RKO that was one heck of a visual. Good match between both men.
WrestleMania XXVII

vs. World Champion Christian - Less than a week after winning the World Championship in a Ladder Match, Christian had to defend the championship here.  Orton was in control early with Christian being able to regain control after an Orton clothesline that sent both men over the top rope to the floor with Orton's foot kicking Christian's head on the way down.  Both men traded momentum pulling out all the stops as the match went on such as Christian's top rope offense of a missile dropkick & flying crossbody while Orton delivered his snap powerslam & hanging DDT before catching Christian in the middle of one high risk move too many.  This was one of the best TV quality matches of the year (so far).
""SmackDown"" May '11

(Blu-Ray) Royal Rumble Match - This Rumble heavily made up for last years as we got a bunch of welcomed surprises here in terms of either performances or special appearances and at one point, we had the most wrestlers in the ring at the same time during the match that I ever remember seeing. Various highlights include the opening minutes with the young talents getting the spotlight for a while, Cryme Tyme's coin flip, how Mysterio re-entered the ring after being tossed out, the ""Rhodes Family Reunion"", Rob Van Dam's appearance & ""no ring rust"" performance including one awesome looking double team move he did with Mysterio at one point, Santino's Rumble performance, ""Hi I'm Dolph Ziggler"", seeing the 400 pound Big Show ""skin the cat"" at one point, and the dominance of Randy Orton's Legacy. Great Rumble match overall that delivered.
Royal Rumble 09

(Blu-Ray) WWE Championship/3 Stages Of Hell Match (Regular, Falls Count Anywhere, Stretcher) vs. Triple H - Don't let the match ""stipulation"" fool you as this was really just a stretcher match as the first two falls went by really quick & could have been left out because that ended up hurting this match more than helping in the end. This was your typical Triple H/Orton brawl as it went in the ring, through the crowd, and made it's way onto the stage with a few nice spots with the stretcher with a nice story of Orton focusing on Triple H's bad leg throughout the match. Overall, just like how their WrestleMania match wasn't a bad match but it wasn't at the level you would & should expect for a WrestleMania main event...this was a good stretcher match but a horrible 2 Out Of 3 falls/3 Stages Of Hell match which was the match advertised.
The Bash 09

(Blu-Ray) World Championship Match vs. Christian - Both Lawler & Cole left to get ready for their match leaving Josh & Booker to do the commentary. They did some nice early back & forth wrestling with Christian backdropping Orton over the ropes then dropkicking him through the ropes before Orton later came back with a giant suplex from the top rope that ended up hurting his own head in the process. Both men went back & forth with their counters & strikes coming so close with their near falls including one moment with Christian escaping Orton's hanging DDT to later execute a flying headbutt that I haven't seen done since Chris Benoit. The announcers tried to put it over that the crowd was split when you could clearly hear ""Let's Go Christian!"" as Randy Orton pulled out a new submission in the reverse Boston Crab (or Colt Cabana's ""Billy Goat's Curse""). Both men kept blocking each others signature moves & turning them into counters such a Christian's double foot kick in the corner into a hanging DDT, Christian's attempted spear into a snap powerslam by Orton, Orton's punt into a spear, and going back & forth between the Killswitch & RKO. This was definitely the match of the night as these two meshed well together in one of those performances that have both men walking out with more credibility than they did going in as Christian was able to pull more out of Orton than others have been able to.
Over The Limit 11

I like the different approach to the documentary as far as following him on ""The Road To WrestleMania"" but in doing so, I felt like they didn't cover various & moments about his career like important feuds & things worth mentioning like working with his Dad back in 2005.  As for the match selection, I know a bunch of people are upset that his World Title victory over Benoit wasn't on here but we know the stance WWE has in regards to Chris Benoit for the past four years & it isn't going to change so it's really pointless to argue about it but Orton's had close to a decade long WWE career so they aren't going to get every match he's done but some of the matches (Dusty & Hogan) were pointless & could have easily been replaced with more quality matches that haven't been released to a DVD set like the No Mercy '07 ""Last Man Standing"" match against Triple H.  Past those things, I was satisfied with the release overall & it's something Randy Orton fans would enjoy overall.",1315440000,9,17687,4.562105926860025
4579766,5,B0055SJYMW,"Okay, so I am reviewing this DVD set after watching it yesterday.  The documentary portion was well done.  They had shown some behind-the-scenes footage of Randy's lives both at home and on the road with WWE. I won't get into too much detail for those of you wanting to find out more for yourself... but he brings up his childhood in the St. Louis area, meeting his future wife Samantha, and dealings with all things WWE.  Randy does a good job of describing his feelings and actions at several points during his career (the good and the bad), which you can appreciate.  Others connected to the wrestling business, such as Triple H, Arn Anderson, Cody Rhodes, and a lot more share their thoughts on where Randy has gone and where he has been.  Very entertaining to see these guys break character and just be themselves for a change.  Samantha Orton gives a very honest look at Randy and their relationship together over the past many years, which is another good peek at the whole look inside the world of Randy Orton.

I won't go match-by-match, but they are all very solid.  Of course, they didn't show the match against Chris Benoit at SummerSlam 2004.  That is a shame, but my memories are still very clear from around the time and if you want to see that one, just go look for it somewhere.  The rest of them are very good and to me, clearly show the progression from the beginning and middle of his career.  Hard to believe that he has been around almost 10 years now... all of us fans hope it will be at least 10 more.

So, I am still giving this RKO collection five stars and it is a must-see for all of WWE fans... not just those of Randy Orton.  They did a great job in producing this DVD set and I can finally say it it was well worth the wait.  I hope you all will enjoy this one as much as I did.",1315353600,3,1809,4.2823529411764705
4579767,4,B0055SJYMW,"This is a great DVD set, featuring lots of good matches spread throughout Orton's career.  I wish he had given some commentary on some of the matches (like Chris Jericho did on his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-the-Code-Behind-the-Walls-of-Chris-Jericho/dp/B003Q7B7F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking the Code: Behind the Walls of Chris Jericho</a>&nbsp;) so we could get more of the psychology behind the action.

The main documentary feature itself is good, but it is a strange mixture of going between ""This is all Real"" and ""This is a character I play.""  The documentary itself is structured off of the Orton/Punk feud that led into Wrestlemania 27.  For those sections, it is played as if everything is ""real.""  Orton talks about how he is doing everything he can to win the match.  The announcer talks about how focused Orton is on getting his nemesis in the ring.  That is contrasted throughout the documentary with segments dealing with Orton's ""evolution"" from an arrogant kid to the superstar he is today.  During those segments, the curtain is pulled back.  We hear about Orton's drug problems (though not with any real specificity), his problems backstage, and his brief stint in the Marines (a very interesting segment).  Orton even talks about how he's acting and playing a character now.  The whole thing feels off, because these two parts never marry up successfully.  Personally, I wish they'd just drop the ""this is real"" stuff from the DVDs.  I think most fans like getting a behind the scenes look without feeling pandered to.

One final note:  The Blu-Ray is a 2 disk set, not a 3 disk set like some of the text on this Amazon page suggests (indeed, the Blu-Ray itself even has a sticker on the packaging claiming it is a 3 disk set, but the box itself makes it clear that there are only two disks).  All the content from the DVD set is here...it is just stored on 2 disks, due to the higher storage capacity of the Blu-Ray disks.",1315267200,2,2008,5.076219512195122
