Like Air, Kanon will take you on a curious journey of broken people with broken lives. This one however does come with a much happier ending. We had to wait a little longer because of ADVs problems and we should thank Funimation for getting us the last volume.
I think the reason why these shows like Air and Kanon get to be liked by most all who see them is the stories are not too far removed from our own lives. Sure we might not be channeling a thousand year-old mystic or a Kitsune but there are some issues and experiences that these characters have, that a lot of people can identify with . . . ideas like that and some good writing can really grab you and suck you into the stories.
I am usually not one for smarmy melodrama so I guess this is my way of saying this is great stuff to watch.
I can hardly wait for the next Kyo-ani/Key import . . . Clannad . . .",1225065600,3,1009,4.674157303370786
8294398,5,B001DOBH36,"Well it took a little while but thanks to funimation we finnaly have the last volume of kanon. Wrapping up the series this volume really put a nice end to the show.

The interesting thing about this series is that most of your typical shows that involve one guy and a bunch of girls the show is always centered on the girls with the guy there mainly to help the story along. However in Kanon the Yuichi (the guy) is really the focus of the whole show. Once more you acctually end up really likeing the character, props therefore go out to the writers and the voice actor (Chris Patton) for bringing the character to life.

The other thing that I end up enjoying aobut this show is that for once we get the ending we wanted. Often anime series will end poorly or in a way that leaves the veiwer not completely satisfied. Not so here, call me a sap if you want but I am glad I finnally got to see a happy ending in a show I have grown to love.",1224288000,,941,4.108695652173913
8294399,5,B001DOBH36,"First off, let us all give thanks to Funimation for bringing out this disc!  When ADV lost their license after Volume 5, it looked like we'd never get to see the conclusion of the series.

In these last four episodes, we find out the real reason that Yuichi can't remember his past, Ayu's story comes to a conclusion, and there's a few unexpected plot twists.  And yes, of course, you'll cry.

The ending is great. I don't want to give away any more than that.  Suffice it to say that this series has now replaced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Air-TV-Volume-1/dp/B000RHMQLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Air TV, Volume 1</a>&nbsp;as my favorite series.",1223942400,4,694,5.634615384615385
