8156000,3,B000KF0GW2,"This is the second of a 3 DVD series of toning, body awareness/loving your body, being sensual & a striptease routine for your significant other. Check out her ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Felinity-Core-Sensuality-First-Step/dp/B000KF0GVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Felinity Core Sensuality: First Step</a>&nbsp;for a review on her first one.
It has chapter choices (Awakening, Feline, Lower Body, Abs, Sun Series, Discovery, Traveling, Dance:Handle with Care), teaches in English, Spanish, French & it can be viewed w/ or w/o narration or music.
Bonus material includes: * Commentary w/Alyson & the producer. * Bio of Alyson who is a well trained dancer in many categories but hates looking for validation from large audiences. She noticed better body awareness & mind/body connection when dancing for herself & looking to teach that to other women. * Beautiful, confident dancing by Alyson * Pole dancing by Alyson (a lot of advanced pole spins)
The dancing taught & show is beautiful & sensual, of loving your body & confidence, not sleaze & simulated s*x movements. Set in a large simply & beautifully furnished studio with Alyson Joy & two other women in shape, one who shows modifications. Alyson speaks in a patient voice & gives plenty of details, telling you how it should affect you, what your intentions should be, to love your curves/body & she cues YOUR left/right. The pace is always as slow as possible to be more aware of how your body moves which makes everything harder to do.
All moves are done as sensually & confidently as possible & slow as possible to really build up your strength as well as make you aware of your body. This made it more challenging then a lot of pilates dvds.

Cons:
Same as the first dvd:
Alyson reminds you to be in touch with your body, caress it, feel it, always do each movement as sensually as possible, etc. which is great, but my only complaint is she keeps repeating ""I know this is hard ladies, this is the last one...."" which reminds me it's a workout & takes the fun out of it.
With the extra slow toning & the music also has a very slow beat & is very low made the workout drag on a bit so take off a star or 2 if that is a concern. Luckily you can do this w/o music or w/o her narration if you choose.
Three quarters of this dvd is almost exactly the same as the first one if not the exact same recording. You only get a different warm-up & 8 min dance routine.
