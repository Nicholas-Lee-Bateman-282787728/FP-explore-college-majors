7813244,5,6301648897,"I loved everything on this VHS. I wish that WB would release it on DVD. Personally speaking, there can never be too much SONDHEIM, and three classic original performances are captured here. 1. The original version of ""You could drive a person crazy"" from COMPANY. 2. The original version of ""Send in the Clowns"" from A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC sung by Glynis Johns, and 3. ""Could I Leave You"" from FOLLIES sung by Alexis Smith. These three performance alone make this VHS a ""must have"" for the Sondheim Fans. Among the great performers on this VHS are Ethel Merman, Nell Carter, Debbie Reynolds and Chita Rivera. How could anyone pass this up?",1328227200,,637,4.696428571428571
7813245,5,6301648897,"This taping absolutely blew me away! I originally bought it for the single purpose of seeing Barry Bostwick perform ""Summer Loving"" (instead of the talentless Travolta) after hearing the recording of the orginal ""Grease!"" cast. What an incredible find. As someone who is in love with musical theatre-I consider this film a treasure! To see such talented performers reviving the roles that they created is a once in a life time oportunity caught here for generations to fall in love with. You are treated to Broadway's Grand Dame Ethel Merman singing 2 of her timeless classics, Nell Carter bringing character and energy to Cole Porter music, Barry Bostwick and Carol Demas proving once and for all who the real Danny and Sandy were, Stephen Nathan and David Haskell tackling probably one of the most challenging duets ever-from ""Godspell"", the enigmatic Chita Rivera dancing to ""The Shriners' Ballet"" as well as singing and hoofing to ""Little One New York"",multi-talented Jerry Orback singing ""Try to Remember"" and the show-stopping ""Lullaby of Broadway"", and Ray Walston, gleefully reminising ""The Good Ol' Days"". Any self-respecting Broadway and/or musical theatre fan should own this taping. It gives the audience a glipmse back to a time when it took pure talent to make in on the Great White Way!!",1035504000,8,1302,5.117370892018779
7813246,5,6301648897,"At first, I wasn't a big fan of Broadway. I mean sure, a little music here, a little dancing there, but I just didn't see what's so fantastic about some street in New York. One of my closer friends gave me this video, and I was about to return it to the store, when I decided to give it a try. Boy was it a great decision. I didn't even know the songs, and I was up dancing and singing all over my livingroom carpet. For either the big broadway fan, or the bored bum, this VHS is sure to get you laughing, crying, and dancing in your seat. Want a great buy? Don't look farther.
Here are my rankings of the songs sung:
1)Fantasticks
2)Annie Get Your Gun
3)Ain't Misbehavin'
4)Company
5)How to suceed in business without really trying.
That's all you need to know. And if you need to know more, than look at the price. Make the best buy. Get ""That's Singing""",1022112000,,856,4.193939393939394
7813247,5,6301648897,"I was at the taping of this video at the La Mirada Civic Auditorium. It is an evening that is unforgettable and thanks to this tape, I can always have a reminder of this cavalcade of treasures. One ad appeared in the L.A. Times for the $15 tickets to the taping. The ad included a large list of the names of Broadway stars that ""might"" be there. The tickets sold out in hours. The audience was filled with Broadway musical fanatics not knowing who would appear. When ""Miss Ethel Merman"" was announced as the opening performer absolute pandemonium ensued and when she sang ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" there was awe-struck silence  followed by applause that almost did raise the roof. It didn't let up for the entire performance. As the tape shows, we were present at a performance uniqurly historic. Other reviewers on this site have mentioned some of the highlights of this tape. To me the pinnacle of this concert is Glynis Johns singing the song she introduced (""Send In the Clowns"") wiith her original co-star Len Cariou. This performance includes not only this world-class song but the dialogue that ties it all together. This almost complete scene from Sondheim's ""A Little Night Music"" is worthy of Shakespeare. It is one of the most moving, funny, charming and gently profound scenes I have ever witnessed. And this is the only video record of it.
In short, if you love the American Musical Theatre, this tape is a must.  Buy it and marvel at one of this country's great art forms, now, sadly, fashionably pooh-poohed. But this form will outlast and be appreciated long after most of today's ultra in-things are no longer remembered. Treat yourself to a celebration of one of the U.S.A's many great contributions to world culture.",974851200,17,1740,4.796666666666667
7813248,5,6301648897,"This video is a great way to see those songs and dances that some of us may be too young to have viewed.  Some of the highlights include the Shriner Ballet, You Could Drive a Person Crazy and SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many others.  Tom Bosley and Ethel Merman star in this all-star cast.",970531200,4,279,4.450980392156863
7813249,4,6301648897,"I have the video ""That's Singing!"" and just to to CHITA RIVERA perform the original choreography of the Shriners Ballet is absolutely enough!  She's Fabulous! She's...DIVA! Other highlights includes Ethel  Merman BELTING ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"", Barry Bostwick  & Carol Demas in the Original rendition of ""Summer Nights""  (GREASE).  Donna McKechnie & Wayne Cilento (2 original cast members of  A CHORUS LINE) meet up again to do a sock hop dance ""Charlie's  Place"" from the musical OVER HERE. Another Dance number is one from  CAN-CAN! Very cute. This video is great for your musical theatre  collection. Buy it, love it.",950659200,4,628,5.2
