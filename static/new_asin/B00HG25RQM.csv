I was going to return it, but as luck would have it, my step-brother had recently passed away leaving in my care two adorable puppies. adorable, yes. obedient, NO. the natural dog training method opened my mind up to training methods and ideas i didn't think were possible. after viewing and utilizing this dvd several times over, i have not only learned how to control my dogs, but also my finances, career, and love life.",1392336000,3,501,4.704545454545454

6162189,5,B00HG25RQM,"Awesome video. We just got a puppy and this method has been working really well. It's all about positive reinforcement and getting your puppy or dog to behave appropriately based on dog psychology and natural instinct rather than punishing them. Seems to be really effective so far.

There were a couple behavioral things that have come up with our puppy that weren't covered in great detail by this video, but it is a great general foundation to use to start, and Joe Ardis Horn has a really good way about explaining this method and why it works.

We combined this video with one or two reference books that included some additional situations and details to fill-in some gaps and for additional details on specific topics we were running into (nipping, crate training problems, etc.), and it has worked out great for our puppy.",1488499200,3,830,4.7972027972027975

6162191,5,B00HG25RQM,"We had never owned a dog before so we were nervous about training our 12 week old toy aussie. We watched this video together and also used some other books to educate ourselves. This video makes it look almost unbelievable as his calm and positive feedback just seem too easy, but it is very believable when you are consistent with his methods. It's like he knew our dog and could predict behavior. In the first month I'd re-watch this to take a refresher course. We now get compliments on your dog and his behavior - much of that is due to the teachings in this video.",1482796800,3,569,4.377358490566038

When Diesel, a pitbull/bernese mountain mix, joined our family last year, Joe's techniques came were a crucial part to our taining.

6162216,5,B00HG25RQM,"What a great DVD. Joe is clear and articulate and just makes sense. How refreshing to find something both educational and funny. I love the part where he mimics the overly talkative dog owner, ""Now stop that now, you know full well we've already had this discussion several times now. Mommy doesn't want you tugging on this leash. This is the 4th time this week we've gone over this,"" or something to that effect. Had me laughing and learning.

Many sections of situations that your dog might face with easy-to-follow instructions for how to improve your dog's behavior and establish yourself as the ""alpha male.""  However, I primarily got this DVD for the purpose of training my cocker spaniel (a 5 yr. old rescue) to come when she's called so she can roam around our large backyard and not stray into neighbors' yards or, worse, into the road.  This command was not covered at all, and I was very surprised, as it's one of the most basic and most important things to teach your dog.  I would've appreciated this being covered far more than nutrition, which you can talk about with your vet.  So I had to look elsewhere for the one thing I was hoping to learn from this video.",1427500800,15,811,4.527397260273973

Joe actually came over to our house and within 2 hours had them both sitting and staying. This video is well worth the money if you have any dog that wants to jump on your furniture, rush into your house when you let them in or jump up on you. He also teaches much more in this video. We are extremely happy with this video. I did not think Mattie could be taught to sit and with in 5 minutes of him working with her she was sitting. Actually he was training us how to treat our dogs.

6162228,5,B00HG25RQM,I was skeptical to be honest! I did not think i can just watch a dvd and be able to get the dog trained.

6162233,5,B00HG25RQM,"My puppy, who has lived with me for two weeks, had becom my lord and master and was nippy, barky, domineering, naughty (grabbing things in the yard to make me chase him, I had to because they were rocks and chokey things). He was Dr Strangelove. Sweet, absolutely adorable and in control and I was trying to adore him out of it...he's not even my first puppy! So I bought this DVD out of desperation. My fiancee and I watched it LAST NIGHT and now he knows sit and come and I walk him on a leash in the back yard so he potties on command. So far, no more ""yay, rocks! cough cough Chase Me!"" He waits until I go throygh the door. He is calmer and today he sat and waited patiently for his food instead of literally barking orders at me. I learned SO much from this DVD. The trainer is calm, assertive, confident and an outstanding teacher. Everything he covers is well clarified, except I need more training in how to keep my puppy to give up his feelings of entitlement to my couch. I do the gentle redirect and he remains on his feet, straining against my fingers, arms extended like a zombie ""cooooouuuchhh cooouuuccchh."" My dog is adorable and his antics are very hard to resist but I know now how I let this get out of control and how to fix it. It has not yet been 24 hours but these are major attitude/behavior adjustments and now Im not anxious when he is around. This is a fantastic video that covers all the beginning puppy issues I can think of. I hope he will come out with a second DVD to curb the herding instinct (I have a walking weaver, trip, stumble, etc.) and to get him to drop things on command and what to do if your puppy is resistant to couch claiming. Id also like him to cover issues like socializing your dog with other dogs and what to do if ypu sense an aggressive dog nearby. I say that because he's clear, insightful and projects authority that he can back up with your results. I have a feeling he may have methods for this too. I am much more confident and relaxed now.",1415404800,28,2001,4.227154046997389

6162236,5,B00HG25RQM,"This is one of the most ""real"" dog training DVDs out there. Ardis has put together a very straightforward, no-nonsense training DVD that gets right to the point. He uses the three-step process of teaching that has been proven to be the most effective way of transferring information (tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, and tell them what you told them). Thus, for each training element, he first introduces the concept, then he switches to a clip or clips that demonstrate(s) exactly how to accomplish the task. Next is a short summation, and then a point list is shown on the screen (""To Review: 1., 2., 3., ...""). Very well done!

The dvd is home movie quality. Don't expect anything close to hollywood. However, everything is explained well. After watching, my husband, 11 year old daughter, 10 year old son and myself walked away feeling much more confident in preparing for our new puppy.

He demonstrates all the techniques with his own, untrained puppy. It is amazing how the puppy is able pick-up on the sit, lay and stay commands in just minutes. His technique is calm and simple. He uses treats and positive reinforcement. He also demonstrates how his techniques works just as easily on mature dogs.

We are now watching the video a second time in order to reinforce the techniques.

6162250,5,B00HG25RQM,"I loved this DVD!  Joe provides easy to follow advice for both owner and their beloved friend.  Joe's methods are down to earth and well, natural, no gimicks.  I have always been leary of some of these training videos but found this one to be very helpful.  I have already started using the methods on my minature pinschers with positive results. And as anyone who owns min pins knows these guys tend to have a mind of their own.",1393804800,4,429,4.3924050632911396
6162251,5,B00HG25RQM,"I have a 8 year old 10lb Coton de Tular. She is adorable, however she had a horrible habit jumping up on the leather couch and digging in the cushions. The lessons and attitude that Joe showed me. Had an effect in about fifteen minutes of training. After a day she completely stopped jumping on the couch at all and shes started to learn ""STAY"". I made the changes in my voice and started issuing commands rather than conversations and my old dog is learning new tricks. I am showing this DVD to my sister who is having some trouble with her dog bursting out the door. If you need some help training your dog this DVD goes into not only what you need to do but the why and the how of what your doing. There is so much in this dvd I wish I had it when Cherub was a puppy.",1393286400,17,770,4.03921568627451

I have three divas (two pugs and a yorkie) and the information Joe shares helped me better manage the sudden barking outbursts by the pugs and also helped me take better care of the health of my yorkie, ladybird.

Maggie is slowly comming around, change is hard for a dog and owner.

Simple, to the point. And very much in line with the work of my trainer and how I see human/dog relationship",1529193600,,121,4.304347826086956
8632603,4,B00HG25RQM,"Worth it for me for the simple and effective ""best practices"" for relating to my dog that as a first-time dog owner I wasn't aware of. I've been amazed since watching this how few other dog owners know some of this stuff, and it makes me feel like a genius! I like that it focuses on positive reinforcement but also acknowledges basic truths about dog-human relationships, such as gently establishing dominance. I did personally find the camera focusing on the presenter's family members a bit off-putting but overall a great video.",1523145600,,532,4.857142857142857
8632604,1,B00HG25RQM,"Why are you on the wrong side of the dog when you are walking them?? Not much positive reinforcemnents given to the dog, petting and praise. You need to be using a 6-foot leash instead of the short lead you were working with, your dog always looked like they were getting pulled at too quick of a pace. I was not impressed at all with this DVD.",1523145600,,344,4.149253731343284

This book is predominantly about training puppies. Nothing about stopping young dogs biting. This guys methods aren't that good.,1515283200,,264,4.520833333333333
8632607,2,B00HG25RQM,This book just isn't very good.  The techniques are ok but not very current as far as animal behavior sciences have advanced.  There are way better books out there.,1509062400,,164,4.620689655172414

It was full of helpful advice, not only telling us what and how to train our little girl, but also showing us how with dogs.  Even his young daughters could use the methods with the dogs that he trained!  He is a good teacher:  for dogs, as well as humans!  We definitely recommend this DVD!
