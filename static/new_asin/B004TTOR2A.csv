4466008,4,B004TTOR2A,"Loved this. Brought back so many childhood memories. Sadly, though, a production company destroyed nearly 300 of the show's videotapes in a dispute over syndication rights. Winchell later settled for 12 or so million from the company, but I believe there are only a handful left of these episodes. Sad.",1385942400,2,302,5.06
4466009,5,B004TTOR2A,This video brought back happy memories from my childhood.  I recommend to to everyone who W's rasied on great TV hows.,1378425600,,118,4.619047619047619
4466010,5,B004TTOR2A,"When I bought this as a hardcore Paul Winchell fan but I had no idea that this would be one of my fondest memories... the TV classic show Winchell Mahoney Time. There are so few of tgese left since mean, heartless people who erased mist of them advertising a lawsuit to Mr Paul Winchell.

It brought me back to my childhood and the reason I wanted so badly to become a ventriloquist.",1377907200,6,383,4.319444444444445
4466011,5,B004TTOR2A,This does bring back memories but you can download it for free in lots of places like Retroflick.com ... this seems to be the only existing full episode available in any type of high quality video.  Sad because it was a great show.,1361318400,2,231,4.372093023255814
4466012,3,B004TTOR2A,"As a boy, I loved Paul Winchell and company. However, I was probably too young to see this version when it originally aired. I think Mr. Winchell is about the best ventriloquist I've ever seen. The main thing that made me rate this 3 stars rather than more was the barrage of commercials for Tootsie Rolls. It was built into the skits and even some of the costumes. If you can overlook that, you can still appreciate Paul Winchell's talent both with the ventriloquism and his creativity. A better choice would be Stop, Look, and Laugh a feature film released around 1960. It showcases winchell's talent interspersed with portions of Three Stooges episodes. Much more fun !",1360454400,3,672,4.752136752136752
4466013,3,B004TTOR2A,"I placed this in my DVD player, it would not play.  I suspect that it is a CD that plays without any pictures.  I expected a DVD with DVD resluts.",1360454400,,146,3.8333333333333335
4466014,5,B004TTOR2A,This was something that would \come to mind every now and then. And when I stumbled upon it on Amazon.com I just had to have it. Thank you.,1346803200,,139,4.0
4466015,3,B004TTOR2A,My husband enjoyed the video very much but I thought for the price their should have been at least two shows !!! Quality of DVD was excellent though all considering !!,1330819200,5,167,4.419354838709677
4466016,5,B004TTOR2A,"Paul Winchell is an excellent ventriloquist/comedian. The show itself is an excellent time piece complete with product placement done 1950's style. Winchell's timing and adlibbing is delightful with his vent figures and his interaction with the other characters on the show. He was ahead of his time with the manipulation of his two characters, Jerry Mahoney and Knucklehead Smiff. He has a backdrop that he and the dummies sit in front of and another puppeteer is hidden behind the backdrop posing as the dummies' arms and hands, intern bringing more life to the dummies. 1950's tv is so different from today's tv. There is no real commercial break. It's blended right into the show. Tootsie rolls is the main sponsor. And it's fun to see how tootsie rolls have changed over the years. Above all the show is full of good wholesome fun. It's worth watching",1330560000,6,856,4.86986301369863
4466017,5,B004TTOR2A,Classic.  Wish things could be this simple again.,1441238400,,49,5.125
4466018,3,B004TTOR2A,50''s kid show brought me back to how hokie but entertaining TV was...that kids loved!,1440892800,,86,4.8

4466020,5,B004TTOR2A,I was kind of disappointed the there was only one episode on there.,1439510400,,67,4.230769230769231
4466021,2,B004TTOR2A,As window into what TV was really like in the early 50's this is probably good.  Not really that entertaining.  It made me uncomfortable.,1437436800,,137,4.666666666666667
4466022,1,B004TTOR2A,Dont bother I really had hopes for this one but it was horrible one long tootsie roll commercial and not in a good way.,1437350400,,119,4.0
4466023,4,B004TTOR2A,This is not a very good show but it is fun to see what TV executives thought of kids in the 50's. It really just an ad for Tootsie Rolls. And a Howdy Doody rip off.,1436400000,,164,3.5833333333333335
4466024,3,B004TTOR2A,"I loved it when I was a kid.  Everything was more wondrous then.  It was fun to see it again now, just not as wondrous as it once was.",1432944000,,134,3.586206896551724
4466025,5,B004TTOR2A,It was fun to watch...,1432944000,,22,3.6
4466026,5,B004TTOR2A,"I gave it 5 stars just for the nostalgia value. I am of the era, but actually didn't really remember the show much. Like all shows of the time period, it it was pretty cheesy. And the commercials are truly something to behold!",1431734400,,226,4.27906976744186
4466027,3,B004TTOR2A,OK,1431648000,,2,2.0
4466028,3,B004TTOR2A,Just for the fun of a program older than I am.  Content boring.  All a Tootsie Roll commercial.,1425945600,,95,4.222222222222222

4466032,1,B004TTOR2A,don't care for kids shows,1404172800,,25,4.2
4466033,1,B004TTOR2A,It was merely a giant Tootsie Roll advertisement and the skits were so sad.  Don't waste your time. It's nothing like the Dick Van Dyke show or I love Lucy.,1402704000,,156,4.2
4466034,5,B004TTOR2A,"I had forgotten about this show. Watching it brought back so many memories and an education, too.  We were so taken in by the simplest of backdrops and story lines.  And the children were polite.  It all looks so old-fashioned, but it is really excellent in its simplicity.",1399420800,,273,4.645833333333333
4466035,3,B004TTOR2A,"A very young Paul Winchell hosts a children's TV show which is little more than an endless series of plugs for the show's sponsors. It is an enjoyable look at children's TV of yesteryear. The production values show how far TV has come, in production.,and how little it has come in substance or content. Walk over to your set,turn the dial, and enjoy a glimpse of the past.",1389657600,,372,4.485294117647059
4466036,5,B004TTOR2A,"I was born in 1950 and back then TV shows were clean and wholesome.
They carried moral values sadly not found in TV shows today. Paul Winchell
and Jerry Mahoney are the shows our children should be watching today.",1387065600,,213,4.487179487179487
8440906,1,B004TTOR2A,This is one long Tootsie Roll commercial. Only a half hour of product plugging from 50+ years ago. Not worth the money.,1482624000,,119,4.454545454545454
8440907,1,B004TTOR2A,Its less than 30 minutes long. I didn't realize that when buying that is my fault.. still not a good value for price.,1480982400,,117,4.130434782608695
8440908,5,B004TTOR2A,"There are some totally amazing memories here! We had fun realizing that all those little kids in the audience are probably grandparents or great-grandparents! I sensed a bit of Pee-Wee's Playhouse here, sans the wicked irony. What fun to see Milton DeLugg looking like a teenager! Paul Winchell was a brilliant ventriloquist who later turned his talents to inventing one of the first artificial hearts. He also authored God 2000 - Religion Without The Bible. His children's show is a trip back in time and some insight into the childhoods that created baby boomers!",1477872000,2,565,5.0212765957446805
8440909,4,B004TTOR2A,Took me back in time.  I guess this was top of the line entertainment in the 50's.  Some today may consider it lame.  I found it enjoyable.,1468368000,,139,4.074074074074074
8440910,5,B004TTOR2A,Use to watch these old shows in the early years of TV.,1465084800,,54,3.5833333333333335

8440913,5,B004TTOR2A,"Wow, this was a lot of fun - basically a fore-runner of ""Nickelodeon Double Dare"" combined with a half-hour commercial for Tootsie Rolls for boy scouts and girl scouts, some ""occasional"" fire safety tips, and give away of Winchell's book ""Ventriloquism for Fun and Profit""!  (Now I want to find the book!)",1458259200,,305,4.865384615384615
