7994704,4,B00009ZK6R,This is a great video. It's got a lot of good information in it for any style of Karate.,1475712000,,88,3.6842105263157894

7994706,5,B00009ZK6R,"I had the good fortune of training under Mr. Dalke while a student at UC Riverside in 1989-91. While dubious ""grand masters"" and ""10th-degree black belts"" abound, Mr. Dalke is the real thing. Not only is he distinguished worldwide as an authentic and excellent karate practitioner, Mr. Dalke is also an enthusiastic and eloquent instructor.
Both sparring videos (Kumite #1 and #2) effectively distill the essential principles that Mr. Dalke has taught for many decades. The concepts of attitude, timing, and distance he emphasizes form the basis for highly effective competitive and self-defense strategies.
If you don't get the opportunity to train with Ray Dalke personally, these videos are the next best thing.",1089244800,10,714,5.327433628318584
7994707,5,B00009ZK6R,"This is one of the best videos on Shotokan Karate in the market today. What sets this apart from the other videos is that Sensei
Dalke teaches the principles, the underpinnings of this style of karate. He shows us how to move the body correctly. He does all these in a very clear and concise much like a college professor.
The tapes are not only instructive but also enjoyable to watch.
I have no reservations at all in recommending this video tape series. I hope he comes out with more videos in the series.",1013817600,2,508,4.414893617021277
