8627567,5,B00GU33CZG,"Sabrina Mesko is the foremost authority and guru for hand mudra teachings.  She is not only beautiful and charming, she also knows her practice, does it, and teaches it clearly and directly so that anyone, even children and seniors, can follow her.  I do these hand mudras myself along with her DVDs and they are terrific.  Well worth the investment in time and money.",1476057600,,368,4.71875
8627568,3,B00GU33CZG,"I know nothing about mudra, but would like to learn.  This DVD is, in my opinion, one of a pair of Ms. Mesko's DVD's.  I tried them because I thought they might give quite a comprehensive introduction.  The production quality of the DVD is quite good.  The background music is quite good.  There are several mudras, each for a different purpose, offered in correlation with each different chakra.  In that sense, it is quite thorough, quite good.  It tries to relate mudra to mantra, offering appropriate mantras to accompany each mudra.  A person like me would naturally regard this as an alternate technique to try, experimenting directly to see whether it works or not.  Almost inevitably, it won't work, at least for a person like me.  Too much of the background material is simply omitted.  When it works, mudra works by making and using subtle bio-electric connections with the fingers and hands.  There is a ""break in"" period that is never mentioned.  You have to use a mudra for some period of time before it even ""gets hooked up"" so it could work.  Further, mudras require different periods of time to work.  Some mudras require 45 minute sessions each day if you want them to work for you.  That sort of requirement is not mentioned here.  For a person like me, someone in the cheap seats, the little cheap books by Advaita are much better.  They cost less.  They tell you what you can expect.  If you work them as suggested, they do ""kick in"" at the times Advaita suggests they should.  You learn more mudras from this DVD, and it has good and ""exotic"" production values, but it leaves out some of the gritty background you would need if you wanted serious benefit.  I would simply give up on it as something that doesn't work before it had a real chance, unless I had other references.",1467763200,2,1797,4.6025236593059935
