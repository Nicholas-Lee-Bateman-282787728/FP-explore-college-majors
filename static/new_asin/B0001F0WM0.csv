1994665,5,B0001F0WM0,"Beautiful transfer of Road To Bali.
The High Definition brings out the Technicolor frame beautifully.
 Road To Rio also looks quite nice ,not as good as the above,but pretty good.
Lively soundtracks ,with great quality for Mono Movies.

Highley Reccomended.
Now where is the Blu-Ray edition.",1204761600,2,291,5.304347826086956
1994666,4,B0001F0WM0,"On the face of it 2 Hope/Crosby films for $13.95 seems like a bargain. And in a way it is. There are no extras but you do get two excellent films.
First of all The Road to Rio. The bar has been set with Casablanca showing that black and white films can look stunning on HD. Unfortunately this appears to have come from a rather sub standard print. It does look better than a standard DVD during closeups but on the whole it isn't much of an improvement. But sound is good and clear.
Second of the two is Road to Bali. In comparison this does look like a HD transfer. There is excellent contrast, colours are bright and there is a lot of detail. It's not as good as some HD transfers but it is a big improvement over a standard DVD.
In conclusion I would recommend buying this for Road to Bali alone and seeing Road to Rio as an added bonus.",1201910400,5,840,4.128048780487805
1994667,3,B0001F0WM0,"Love the Road to series. I watched them with my parents when I was a kid on VHS. While the hd-dvd versions are better than the recent dvd counterparts, it isn't by much. The Road to Rio looks a little washed out in many scenes and the Bali suffers from over saturation. I was hoping that Road to Rio would have the sharp blacks, whites, and grays of Casablanca, but it did not. Road to Bali is the best of the two, visually. Still, they look a heck of a lot better than earlier versions. The audio is cleaned up with no annoying film static.

There are no special features (aside from an alternative french ending to Road to Bali) and you cannot look up anything while the movie is playing (a feature I have grown use to).

Casablanca, Adventures of Robinhood, and the Searchers are waaaaay better transfers. But like I said, it's still cleaner than the DVDs.

Side Note: The cover doesn't look anything like what Amazon is showing.",1201737600,6,932,4.43859649122807

1994671,5,B0001F0WM0,"BCI (Brentwood) had done a wonderful job at transferring these two public domain ""Road"" movies. The color in ""Road to Bali"" is stunning...a few of the ""big time"" DVD companies would be wise to take a lesson from Brentwood.
The black and white ""Road to Rio"" is well done, though not quite as perfect as the color ""Bali"" (""Bali"" was the only color movie made in the ""Road"" series). ""Road to Rio"" is transferred from a UCLA Archive edition of the movie. The sound needs to be turned up a little on this one...but that could be the result of the age of the movie and nothing more.
All in all, a wonderful addition to anyone's classic movie collection. No extras (outside of a Hope biography) and limited chapter marking...but it really doesn't matter.

1994761,5,B0001F0WM0,"The film opens in San Quentin, with the warden granting the incarcerated Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) the privilege of telling his story to a bevy of reporters before he is executed. As Ronnie spins his tale, the camera pans back in time to San Francisco as Ronnie plies his baby photography trade. See, Ronnie had always longed to be a part of the McCloud Detective Agency. He gets a crack at it (sort of) when McCloud is away and the Baroness Carlotta Montay (Dorothy Lamour) assumes Ronnie is a real private eye. She hires him to search for her missing husband (later, she changes it to a missing uncle). Soon, Ronnie is nose-deep in side-splitting jeopardy, cryptic maps, escapades in a brooding mansion and a shady sanitarium, and potentially crazy brunettes.

With this 1947 thriller-comedy, Bob Hope is back to his old tricks. But, this time, his allegiance is shifted from his favorite blonde, Madeleine Carroll, to his favorite brunette, Dorothy Lamour. The look of this film is very dark, with many scenes taking place at night or in very dim venues. As usual, everyone but Bob plays it straight. If not for Bob's relentless barrage of humor, this easily could have passed for a typical film noir. As it is, old Ski-nose zanily upends many detective clichs.

Dorothy Lamour - sans sarong, sans Road picture - makes the most of her rare femme fatale role. There's a comfort level between Dorothy and Bob that translates very well onto the screen. And just when you think this movie is Crosby-bereft, guess which crooner has a cameo? Charles Dingle, Frank Puglia, and John Hoyt have nice supporting parts, with Lon Chaney Jr. and the great but creepy Peter Lorre rounding off the cast nicely. Alan Ladd also has a tiny but amusing cameo.

At this stage of his career, Bob Hope had already perfected his screen persona of cowardly, self-deprecating funnyman. As usual, the jokes come in fast and furious, in strafe-like fashion. In the end, it's yet another terrific showcase for Bob's natural timing and immaculate one-liners. This really is one of his very best movies.

***Joke SPOILERS now*** Ironically, the funniest line of the movie is uttered not by Bob Hope but by a state trooper (threatening Hope): ""If you bother us again, I'll personally punch you in the nose so hard it will look like other peoples' noses."" The second funniest line is said by Bob Hope as he reaches up into a chandelier and pulls out a champagne bottle: ""Aha! Ray Milland's been here!""

Unfortunately all the copies (on DVD) I've purchased over the years are horrific copies of copies from the Public Domain... Why Paramount permitted this film to eclipse its copyright is just plain irresponsible. Imagine my astonishment, when I took a gamble and purchased yet ANOTHER DVD of this film, only to find that ""My Favorite Brunette"" was extracted from a much better - and cleaner - print. It's not the best (as it deserves to be) but it is by far the most beautiful offspring of several generations of prints from the original master. I find this one film alone worth the price of this collection. The other films are great fun, especially for the family (if they aren't yet too sophisticated enough to enjoy great stories in black and white) and I was so relieved to find this collection in such great shape. You will not be the least bit disappointed in this edition. Do not bother with any other DVD release of ""My Favorite Brunette"" - this is the only one I've found that has a quality of about 90%, and believe me, this is as good as gold while it lasts...",1414368000,3,1229,4.5656108597285066

His comedic quips are usually something that only GrandParents would find humorous.  He can't sing, yet many of his movies are Musicals.  He can't Dance, yet several of his movies have him shuffeling about to music.  He's certainly not a handsome leading man, but he gets teamed up with beautiful leading Ladies as the Romantic Interest in his movies.  His best features are as a Political Satirist, or ,  as the movie Straitman to other BETTER character actors.  He's kinda like a sedated Lou Costello.  So most movies that have him featured solo as the lead, usually bomb.  The few exceptions, that are actually KEEPERS, are:  My Favorite Brunette (noir-Comedy), The Seven Little Foys (Musical-Comedy), and  Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number (Action-Comedy) with Phillis Diller, who is GREAT in this movie.

1994892,4,B0001F0WM0,"The good news about this collection of Bob Hope films is that a number of them have been available for years in lousy public domain copies and the prints here are excellent. Here is what you get:

- ""My Favourite Brunette"" is a very funny satire of of the private eye films such as ""The Maltese Falcon"". Dorothy Lamour is very droll here, always at her best with Hope and the film has an excellent supporting cast.
- Two ""Road"" films are included. Neither ""Rio"" nor ""Bali"" are the best in the series but any ""Road"" picture is way ahead of most screen comedies of the time and Hope always brought the best out in Crosby. ""Rio"" is in technicolour and looks great.
- ""The Lemon Drop Kid"" is a typical sentimental Damon Runyon yarn about the characters around Broadway, the old dames and the gangsters. Hope fits in well but the sentiment is laid on thick and dates the film. He does perform an hilarious bit in drag which is worth the rest of the film put together
- ""The Seven Little Foys"" really stretches Hope in the biography of Eddie Foy and his brood. The star dispenses with his regular mugging, does not play for sympathy and does maybe his best straight acting ever. The highlight is his dance with Jimmy Cagney as George M Cohan. This is also an excellent technicolour print.

1994894,5,B0001F0WM0,"The ""Road Pictures"" are among the best movies ever made. The plots are ridiculous and the characters are hilarious. Dorothy Lamour is, of course, gorgeous and glamorous and delightfully sincere in her efforts to help Bing and Bob get out of their various predicaments. ""The Road to Bali"" puts Crosby and Hope in a tropical paradise that threatens to culminate in their demise. Tartans and kilts make an unexpected appearance in a plot twist that will make your head spin. I got the distinct feeling that the Beatles watched ""The Road to Rio"" before they made ""Help."" Some of the same gags appear in both movies, which added to the zaniness for me. The Andrews Sisters drop in to sing with Bing, and a couple of dance/acrobatic acts add to the fun. Pure entertainment with lots of laughs.

There have been so many rubbishy public domain releases of Road to Bali & Rio, with the quality ranging from horrendous all the way up to almost acceptable.  But thanks to the good folks at Shout Factory and Fremantle, finally here is a set with decent picture and sound quality.  Bali is clear with vivid eye-popping Technicolor; Rio is in crisp black & white.  Both are from prints far superior to anything I've seen before.  As noted in a previous review, My Favorite Brunette is also looking rather dandy.

This is the one to get.  Accept no other.",1292284800,62,1454,7.221590909090909
1994897,5,B0001F0WM0,"This is a very good collection of Bob Hope films, but I must admit that I wanted this set especially for ""My Favorite Brunette"". This film has been in the public domain forever, but the Shout factory finally got it correct. In my opinion, this is the best print you are going to find. The print is clear with excellent contrast. You can finally see what's happening in all the dark scenes. For example, when Bob first walks up to the mansion for the first time, when Peter Lorre is moving the clue around in one of the rooms, when Peter Lorre is in the back seat of the car, these and all the scenes are now beautifully clear. Years ago I viewed this movie in this condition and then it seemed to disappear. Even on TCM, the print was bad and I assumed the good print was gone. Well, here it is. If this movie isn't your cup of tea you have all the others to enjoy. The Lemon Drop Kid is another film in this collection where the  print info above applies. The Lemon Drop Kid also qualifies as a Christmas movie and actually introduced the song ""Silver Bells"".  Enjoy!",1292112000,49,1068,4.282178217821782

The print of ""Rio"" is good - not on the same level as ""Bali,"" but still a cut above what one usually finds on public domain releases.

All seven films are excellent, but the first four are funniest, especially ""Road to Morocco"" and ""Road to Utopia"".
Unfortunately, these four are the only titles not yet on Blu-Ray, though I am optimistic.
Paramount Studio's film library is now owned by Universal which has an active Blu-Ray reissue program.
TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATION:
While we are waiting for a Blu-Ray release of the first four titles, they are still available in a nice two-DVD set from Universal for only $10 (Photo One).

BLU-RAY REVIEW:
--- ""Road to Rio"" (1947) and
--- ""Road to Bali"" (1953) were produced by Hope and Crosby, and only distributed by Paramount.
Licensed to Kino Lorber for Bu-Ray release.
the ""Road to Rio"" is given a minimalist release by Kino Lorber with no extras.
My least favorite Road picture.
The writing is not as sharp as the others, plus it is the longest of the seven films (1 hour, 40 minutes), and would have benefited from some tighter editing.
The black and white picture is just OK, despite being preserved by the UCLA Film Archive (apparently the original negative is not pristine).
The ""Road to Bali"" was a great improvement.
The only Road picture filmed in Technicolor: the blu-ray is spectacular,.
Plus Kino Lorber provides an informative audio commentary.

--- ""Road to Hong Kong"" (1962) was filmed nine years later.
Hope's only black and white film after 1953.
Bob and Bing are a bit past their prime and poor Dorothy Lamour is reduced to a cameo (the female romantic interest is actually played by Joan Collins).
Still, it's the funniest Bob Hope comedy of the 1960s.
A minimalist production by Olive Films, despite the fact that they are charging nearly $30 for the Blu-Ray (for the same price, you can buy both the ""Road to Rio"" and ""Road to Bali"" blu-rays).
Boo.
Olive Films also released it on DVD for $13.

One drawback:
None of the blu-rays have English subtitles (the sound is pretty clear though).
The first four Road films in the two-DVD set from Universal had English SDH subtitles, and I expect the eventual blu-rays will too.

OTHER BOB HOPE FILMS on BLU-RAY:
Kino Lorber has released three other Bob Hope films on Blu-Ray:
--- 1947&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Favorite-Brunette-Blu-ray/dp/B072FBSFGX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Favorite Brunette [Blu-ray</a>]
""My Favorite Brunette"" re-united Bob Hope with Dorothy Lamour as his leading lady, and even had a cameo appearance by Bing Crosby, so its almost a Road picture.
--- 1951&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lemon-Drop-Kid-Blu-ray/dp/B072HXD15M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lemon Drop Kid [Blu-ray</a>]
Slightly sappy film, but it did introduce the great Christmas Song ""Silver Bells"".
""My Favorite Brunette"" and ""Lemon Drop Kid"" are given minimalist treatment, but at least the price is reasonable.

--- 1952&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-Paleface-Blu-ray/dp/B071NWDWPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of Paleface [Blu-ray</a>]
One of Hope's funniest films, co-starring Jane Russell.
It was a sequel to Hope's equally funny 1948 film ""Paleface"", also starring Jane Russell.
Weird:
In ""Paleface"" Bob Hope marries Jane Russell.
In ""Son of Paleface"" Bob Hope, playing the the son of himself and Jane Russell, marries Jane Russell.
I'm surprised the censors didn't notice.
The song ""Buttons and Bows"" appears in both films - winner of the Oscar for Best Song in 1948 (""East is east and west is west, and the wrong one I have chose."")
""Son of Paleface"" is given the deluxe treatment by Kino Lorber with an audio commentary.",1503014400,6,5229,6.472103004291846

In the 1940s, singers Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour hooked up with hook-nosed comedian Bob Hope for five road picturescomedies about two erstwhile male vaudeville performers in exotic locations who end up meeting and falling for Lamours character. Was it a formula? Yes and no. Audiences knew exactly what to expect, but Hope and Crosby ad-libbed so much that the films had the added energy of unpredictability.

After taking the road to Singapore (1940), Zanzibar (1941), Morocco (1942), Utopia (1946), and Rio (1947), the trio took to the road again in 1952 for their first and only color excursion, Road to Bali. Crosby plays George Cochran and Hope is Harold Gridley, two entertainers forced to cut engagements in Australia short when they end up wooing one too many farmers daughters and are forced to find other work. The first job that presents itself is deep sea diver, and so they're off on another adventure.

Though its not as funny as Road to Morocco and Road to Utopia, this 91-minute comedy is a good place to start for families with younger children because it is color and because Road to Bali is a kitchen sink film. Writers Frank Butler, Hal Kanter, and William Morrow throw everything into the film, including the kitchen sink, among them:

A treasure hunt
A South Seas princess
A romantic triangle
A long-lost father who turns up
A wedding
A battle with a giant squid
A fight between a tiger and a gorilla
A close call with crocodiles
A lovelorn gorilla who decides Harold is the perfect replacement for the mate she lost
An exploding volcano
A Scottish song-and-dance routine Hope and Crosby perform in kilts
Cameo appearances by Humphrey Bogart (in a film clip) and Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, and Jane Russell
Balinese dancers who move to music that sounds suspiciously like jazz
A snake-charmer takeoff in which the flute player summons not a cobra but a beautiful woman

Road to Bali may not feature the kind of breakneck pacing that young people are used to, but the film shifts gears enough times and has enough color and humor to make it fun for family viewingif, that is, your children are open to older movies. And if your family includes a Baby Boomer or fans of vintage television shows, a bonus is that Carolyn Jones (Morticia on TVs The Addams Family) appears in just her second career role as one of the jilted farmers daughters; Leon Askin (Gen. Burkhalter on TVs Hogans Heroes) turns up as King Ramayana, the ruler of an unspecified idyllic island somewhere between Australia and Bali; and Michael Ansara (Cochise on TVs Broken Arrow and the Blue Djinn on I Dream of Jeannie) is one of the guards that serve the King and Prince Ken Arok (Murvyn Vye).

The Road movies are famous for breaking the fourth wall, and the asides in this picture include Hope telling the audience, Hes going to sing now, so its a good time to go out and get popcorn.

My teenage son (who loved this film when he was 5 or 6all the Road pictures are family-friendly) liked it enough to give it a B+, but I think if he saw other Road pictures he might agree that its more of a B. Road to Bali is directed by Hal Walker, who directed Road to Utopia and was assistant director on Road to Morocco and Road to Zanzibar. This Blu-ray transfer is superior to the DVDs that have been floating around for this title, with only a few brief moments where the film loses its crispness. Whats more, film historians Michael Schlesinger and Mark Evanier provide an informative and sometimes funny commentary track which, along with a Bob Hope promo, constitute the releases only bonus features.

Is it worth adding to your familys Blu-ray library? Absolutely. And lets hope that the other Road movies aren't far behind. Kino Lorber did a nice job on this release.",1500854400,2,3998,4.725968436154949
