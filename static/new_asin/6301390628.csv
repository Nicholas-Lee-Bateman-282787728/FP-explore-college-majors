326729,5,6301390628,"This tape, consisting of two episodes, ""the wishing bear"" and ""the piglet who would be king"" are excellent for children between the ages of 3 and 9. The stories are very appropriate and hearwarming.

The ""wishing bear"" is an episode where Christipher robin shows Pooh how to wish on a star while saying a rhyme. Pooh is frustrated because he forgets the rhyme. With the help of Rabbit and Tigger, Pooh is able to remember it. Pooh and his friends all make a wish on the star, and the star dissipears from the sky. Pooh thinks he has worn the star out, and therefore has to grant all his friends wishes. He also is afraid of dissapointing Christopher Robin, and dresses up like a star and hangs from a tree. Christipher knows it's Pooh.. and tells Pooh that he didn't wear the star out.

The second episode ""The Piglet who would be King"" starts with Pooh giving Piglet a friendship gift. Piglet didn't get anything for Pooh, and decided to travel to the land of milk and honey with rabbit and tigger in order to get Pooh a lot of honey for a gift. There, the little Piglys think Piglet is their King, and look up to him. In the end, Piglet must leave and returns to Pooh with a pot of honey.

Truly amazing stories! I still watch them today...",1103500800,,1242,4.367965367965368
