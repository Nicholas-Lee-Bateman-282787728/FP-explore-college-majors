This is an Amazon exclusive and won't be sold in stores. Amazon worked out a deal with nickelodeon to ""Burn on demand"" meaning upon receiving an order that Amazon will create the dvd and insert then ship it to the buyer...

Audio and picture quality in these dvd's is very good.

5553726,5,B00B2VMNM4,"Here's the 3rd Season we've been waiting for. It seems this third volume is being released after four and five because it contains near twice as many episodes as seasons four and five. Six discs in all will compile the third season episodes and should account for some missing episodes that, according to online episode lists, should have been included in the season four set. Here's a list of the episodes that should come in this set, some are eleven minutes and some are special twenty two minute episodes:

40 Helga Blabs It All / Harold the Butcher
41 Dangerous Lumber / Mr. Hyunh Goes Country
42 Casa Paradiso / Gerald's Tonsils
43 Arnold's Room / Helga vs. Big Patty
44 Stinky Goes Hollywood / Olga Gets Engaged
45 Curly Snaps / Pre-Teen Scream
46 Grandpa's Birthday / Road Trip
47 Sid's Revenge / Roller Coaster
48 The Aptitude Test / Oskar Gets a Job
49 Arnold Betrays Iggy / Helga and the Nanny
50 Career Day / Hey Harold!
51 Best Man / Cool Party
52 Arnold & Lila / Grand Prix
53 Arnold's Thanksgiving
54 Helga's Show / The Flood
55 Phoebe Takes the Fall / The Pig War
56 Part-Time Friends / Bio Square
57 Crabby Author / Rich Kid
58 Girl Trouble / School Dance
59 School Play

62 Eugene's Birthday / Stinky's Pumpkin
63 The Beeper Queen / Oskar Can't Read?
64 Dinner for Four / Phoebe Skips
65 Helga's Parrot / Chocolate Turtles
66 Love and Cheese / Weighing Harold

The set should consist of all the above mentioned 52 stories which are technically spread across 27 twenty two minute episodes, most of which being eleven minute halves. That accounts for all the episodes missing from the fourth season set and includes all the remaining episodes from the series. After buying this season Hey Arnold! fans should be able to own every episode of the series. This set will contain two wonderful episodes, Arnold's Thanksgiving and School Play which both work with the Helga and Arnold dynamic in fun ways.

Anyone worried about the quality of these DVD-R, I wouldn't. I own the first two seasons of this show as well as seasons of Rugrats and Doug on Amazon DVD-R and they play great on all my DVD players. I tend to be uptight about things being quality and have never been bothered by these sets, the shows look as good as or better than when they originally aired in the nineties. The sets do have simple DVD menus, packaging and artwork but it all looks nice enough and gets the job done. My only issue with these sets, me being a purist, is that I'd prefer the option of watching the opening theme before every episode but it only plays before the first on each disc. They do this to preserve the quality of episodes due to compression issues that could start arising and I'm aware most people skip openings anyway, so it's forgivable. Also, don't expect any sort of special features, just the episodes themselves.

FIVE STARS from me for Hey Arnold on DVD-R. I miss growing up in the nineties and highly reccommend this set, thanks for your time.",1260316800,18,3023,4.471014492753623

5553757,5,B00B2VMNM4,"When Hey Arnold debuted in 1996, many kids loved the show. It was one of the most popular shows i watched while growing up. I remember having debates about it in school with episodes with various friends. So we start here with another great season! We have classics such as Helga Blabs It All & Harold The Butcher, Arnolds Room, Helga Vs. Big Patty, Stinky Goes Hollywood & Olga gets engaged, Curly Snaps & Pre-Teen Scream, Grandpas Birthday & road Trip, Sids Revenge, & Roller Coaster, Arnolds Thanksgiving, And Helg'as Show & The Flood where Grandpa claims he remembers the flood of 1915, and they had to go in the arch and restart the world!

5553760,5,B00B2VMNM4,I have always loved the gang from Hey! Arnold. The stories always bring a smile. They are short and sweet!,1392681600,,106,4.35
5553761,3,B00B2VMNM4,"So I was ELATED that I could watch HA! on Amazon Prime with closed captions. I am very hard of hearing, and I'm nearly to the point where even earbuds can't help my understanding of certain voices. I am disappointed and frustrated that on this volume (#3), the captions are a few seconds late to appear. As others who require closed captions to enjoy what they're viewing will understand, this is a very aggravating thing. That's my first star deduction. My second deduction is for the order in which the episodes are placed (i.e. out of order). For example, Mr. Simmons is Arnold's teacher before the episode where he is first introduced as Arnold's teacher. The episodes themselves are just as awesome, but someone messed up along the line.",1391904000,,742,4.75968992248062
5553762,5,B00B2VMNM4,Great! Reminds me why I used to love watching this as a kid. Volume 3 is funny and great. You couldn't ask for a better cartoon than Hey Arnold!,1390521600,,144,4.0
5553763,5,B00B2VMNM4,"This is my favourite Nickelodeon show, and some of the episodes in this season are my favourite. Here are just a few of the episodes that make up the treat in these DVDs - my personal favourites:
""Curly Snaps"" - Curly completely loses it when he is skipped as ball monitor. A very funny and quotable episode. I might be a little biased, since Curly's my second favourite character, but I still think it's a great episode and a must-see, especially for fans of Curly!
""Hey Harold"" - At one of Rhonda's parties, Harold becomes friends with Patty, the sixth-grader known as a bully. I like this mainly for the sweet stuff. Patty is my favourite minor character and a good match for Harold, being generally nice and smart, but using violence to solve her problems (as seen in an earlier episode this season). The ending, when Harold stands up for Patty when his other friends are making fun of her, is incredibly sweet and touching, especially for a character like Harold.
""Pre-Teen Scream"" - Phoebe wins a chance to meet her favourite singer and discovers that he's a complete fake. A must-see for Phoebe fans. She's my third favourite character. Also a good episode for the Helga/Phoebe friendship.
""School Play"" - The school is putting on ""Romeo and Juliet"" and Arnold gets the part of Romeo (due to the fact that no one else will take a part in which they have to kiss a girl). Helga is desperate to get the part of Juliet once she hears that Juliet has to kiss Romeo, but to do so, she will have to get Rhonda, Sheena, Phoebe and Lila to drop out. One of the best Arnold/Helga episodes, and also marking their first kiss.
""Arnold and Lila"" - Helga writes her biggest wish on the wall, then takes off her name when she hears people coming, leaving the words ""Arnold Loves Lila"", leading Lila to believe Arnold has a crush on her. A very good episode, also marking the beginning of Arnold's crush on Lila, which lasted from then to the Season Five episode ""Timberly Loves Arnold"".
These episodes alone are worth the price, and there's several other very good episodes. Honourable mentions go to ""Cool Party"" (Rhonda throws a party for the cool kids only - notable for one of Curly's best moments), ""Road Trip"" (Miriam and Helga get lost on a road trip with no money or map), ""The Flood"" (a flash flood traps the fourth-graders in the school) and ""Helga's Show"" (Helga makes jokes about her classmates and does impressions of them, causing offence). BUY IT!",1386892800,,2455,4.594533029612756
5553764,5,B00B2VMNM4,"One of the most memorable holiday specials ever. The class and Mr. Simmons put on a hilarious Thanksgiving play and of course Harold eats the props before they set the table. Then Arnold heads home for another holiday with his eccentric boarders while his grandma is getting ready for the 4th of July. He bolts and meets up with Helga and they head for the docks discussing how messed up Thanksgiving is for each of their families and just when they start looking on the bright side the Mayflower sinks. Then they head off to Mr. Simmons apartment where he is catering to his chaotic family and friends and realize that their own family gatherings aren't as bad as they seem. It all ends with a fireworks finale on top of Arnold's house. It's worth buying season 3 for ""Arnold's Thanksgiving"" alone, it's hilarious and enjoyable for all.",1384732800,,837,4.662162162162162

5553782,5,B00B2VMNM4,"The DVD case for this boxset is quite slim, but with a good casing. The DVDs were all delivered in new condition. Each boxset like this one has a great deal of episodes, which I was pleased with.

This season in particular had a few of my favorites such as:

Helga Blabs It All - when Helga has to delete her confession off of Arnold's answering machine.
Stinky Goes Hollywood - when Stinky works with Yahoo and becomes excessively popular.
Preteen Scream: when Phoebe gets to meet her favorite singer.
The Flood - when Arnold's whole class gets trapped in school.

All of our favorite kids are given some note in this season. Definitely worth seeing and showing your kids.",1297123200,2,673,4.591666666666667

But I'm really, really disappointed and downright pissed that this isn't available for Amazon Prime now! I had all of these in my video library and didn't get to finish watching before it was taken off Prime. Absolutely ridiculous. You know Amazon is making pennies on these downloads so let the people who pay for Prime continue to watch!",1435363200,,448,4.6835443037974684
