5934875,3,B00ER0QLS4,"Wow. A ton of stuff going on here, good and bad. Lundgren is his usually B-lister fun, but- seriously?-for all the pushing of Vinnie Jones, they never have a showdown.
The lead-well, the narrator, there are really too many characters running around to name one a ""lead"", but the narrator- is dull as dishwater, bland and heartless. But his partner manages to pull off his piece, even add in a few shadings of depth. The friendship between the two is easily to closest thing to realism to be found here.
And what to say about Randy? As a cop sliding into self destruction he is utterly predictable, but he manages to keep things on task and fill his role decently enough that even the borderline silly and out-of-character ""hey look, here's some MMA moves"" fight choreography can't wreck it.
The less said about the paper-thin undercover cop role, the better.
A very mixed bag, but just good enough on the highs to make it worth enduring the lows.",1403136000,,946,4.636904761904762
5934876,3,B00ER0QLS4,Could be because he is not  really in this. Mostly about undercover officers trying to make a case against drug dealers. Even the female officer undercover is not very credible as she compromises her job and lets her feelings get in the way. When Lundgren is in the shots he has little to say and not very well done. better to rent for a couple of dollars than to buy,1397347200,,367,4.242857142857143
5934877,5,B00ER0QLS4,"Good movie and a great story wonderfully produced by your favorite all time action heroes DOLPH LUNDGREN and RANDY COUTURE. Not bad for a team of EXPENDABLES working together for the first time. VINNIE JONES also did a great performance as the head villian in this cop thriller, these kinds of parts really shows his bad side. Overall, AMBUSHED is a must see movie if you're into great police action.

P.S. One movie which DOLPH LUNDGREN battles infected zombies with the help of giant robots is his new release BATTLE OF THE DAMNED. This movie is both action and horror in it's own scary kind of way and one of his best works as an executive producer. DOLPH'S CREATIVE THINKING!!!",1387584000,2,681,4.675
5934878,1,B00ER0QLS4,"This movie was an ABSOLUTE mess.  There wasn't one single character introduced that anyone could care about.  This movie--who obviously thought it ""had it all""--offered so little.  Actually, there were no characters just caricatures:  your Billy Bad-A$$, your Colin Ferrell wannabe, your lesbo couple, your over-the-top ""boss"" who was supposed to be so bad you'd believe he killed kittens as a hobby, who also ate at fine restaurants, was always dressed in a suit, but had the dirtiest shoes you'll ever see, the crooked cop (isn't there always one?), the drug dealer who has found ""the perfect girl,"" (who, by the way, was dumber than a box of rocks), and who wants to get out of the business, major stompings and beatings--which render nary a scratch...and then you had Dolph, who cannot act his way out of a room.  You also had a director (nudge/nudge, wink/wink) who wanted to pay homage to Brian DePalma, with his split-screen,  Trouble is, a split-screen may work a couple of times (think ""Carrie""), but it gets real tired real fast when it is deployed throughout the movie.

I don't know what the people who made this mess were thinking (maybe a fast buck?), but this was one complete, muddled, mess.  It is rated R, lasts a 100 days, and should never be seen by anyone.",1384732800,,1277,4.746606334841629
5934879,2,B00ER0QLS4,"Frank (Daniel Bonjour) lives the American dream as a strip club owner and cocaine dealer. He has an innocent white bread girlfriend Ashley (Cinthya Bornacelli) who attends college and stays separate from his work. Frank has a partner Eddie (Gianni Capaldi) and Frank desires to take his operation to the next level where he works for Vincent (Vinnie Jones). Unfortunately his crimes do not go unnoticed. He is being followed by DEA agent Maxwell (Dolph Lundgren) and associates. A dirty doughnut eating cop (Randy Couture) is added to the mix.

The plot lacks depth and complexity. This is a straight forward crime/drama/thriller/action film. The talents of Dolph Lundgren are under utilized. Oh wait he does rough up a guy for information...only to brush him off and let him go. We needed Dolph for this? They could have used Betty White.

The sound track was pretty decent and of course Vinnie Jones does a good job in his limited role. The main problem with this feature was that Frank, the main character, was not someone we could root for. About 1/3 of the way through the film he gives a useless narration on the drug industry and the economy which never really ties into the film.

A lower tier rental. Dolph fans can skip this one and not miss anything.

5934880,3,B00ER0QLS4,"""We're businessmen not junkies. We control this world or at least I thought so."" Agent Maxwell (Lundgren) is finally about to reach the center of an international cocaine smuggling ring run by Vincent Camastra (Jones). When his partner Agent Royce gets in over her head it is up to Maxwell to get her out and bring the criminals to justice before it's too late. Dolph Lundgren is an actor who started off with a bang (Rocky 4) then slowly started to fade into straight to DVD movies. Most of them are slow, boring and unnecessary. While this one is nothing amazing or original it was entertaining and better then most of his movies. In between the cookie cutter plot there are some actual interesting dialog and borderline social commentary that makes you think. That is not something you would expect from a Lundgren movie. There really isn't much else to say about this, if you've seen one you've seen them all. On the other hand this is better then most of his, which may be because he isn't in it that much. Overall, Lundgren fans will like this. I give it a B-.",1381449600,,1066,4.528497409326425

8608600,4,B00ER0QLS4,"Bias Alert! I am a huge fan of action films so my view maybe a little slanted. First thing you need to know that none of the guys are Oscar Nominated actors (Dolph Lundgren, Vinnie Jones, Randy Couture) so every film that they star in is about action. But I must admit that they did a surprisingly good acting job in this one. Also a surprise is the shocking depth of  this storyline. Don't get me wrong the plot is not fantastic by any stretch of the imagination but it is 10 times better than the usual plot which either of these actors stars in. The action sequences are fairly well done but this is not your standard shoot em up film. This is more about the inner workings of why all sides of the drug trade do what they do and how their choices effect their family and friends.",1420848000,,782,4.213333333333333

8608604,1,B00ER0QLS4,"Terrible mishmash of a plot.  Confusing, rambling and poorly edited - very poorly.  No character that you would even care about.  The main character Frank (Daniel Bonjour) narrated pro drug, killed people coldly smiling about it and then later felt guilty?? thought it might be wrong, had flashbacks and thought about getting out of it.  He wasn't a bad guy.  In a big let down they didn't kill him off.  This was a lousy film with boisterous bad characters doing brutal things without reason.  Just stick a bunch of names,throw in a lot of violence. drugs, lesbians, crooked cop and call it a movie.  Just when I thought Dolph Lundgren was started to do some better movies up pops this turkey.",1407024000,,694,4.677685950413223
