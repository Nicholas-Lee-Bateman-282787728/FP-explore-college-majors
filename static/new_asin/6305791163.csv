1081928,4,6305791163,"Im not saying that people who loved the show on NBC will like it. Im saying that fans of the director will hate it. First off, the dub is a little dry with only two voice actors who do the voices of the animals. Second, in the NBC version the episodes are all mixed up. So when you think you are seeing episodes 1-4, your actually seeing a group of episodes that don't match up in order. Anyway, I like the show and I think kids and adults should see it. Its an anime you can put right on the shelf next to Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. I only wished that the director could have lived to see the Lion King, but then again, he must have been turning in his grave when it came out. Still, if your looking for family anime in a anime market overcrowded with mecha and super powers, pick this one up.",981158400,,803,4.0886075949367084
1081929,4,6305791163,"Seeing Kimba again after 30 or so years is really something special, and will be for anyone who watched it way back when.  Bought the video for my daughter and it became her favorite over all the Disney videos we have!  Bought a second Kimba (DISASTER!) and she loves that one too...  OK, the animation pales compared to today's, but the morality tales packed into each of the short stories, the fast pace, the personalities of the animals, etc.  make it worthwhile watching.  (Wait til your kids start singing, ""who lives down in deepest darkest Africa""...... ).  Enjoy it while its available!",972432000,2,594,4.7745098039215685
1081930,5,6305791163,"Five stars for ""Kimba"", my favorite TV show ever!  This series struck a deep emotional chord that still resonates twenty-five years later.
The animation really is better than the AMAZON reviewer describes.  Yes, it looks choppy compared to ""Aladdin"", but no more than old  ""Huckleberry Hound"" cartoons, and certainly no more than most of  the children's cartoons currently coming out of Japan.  The craftsmanship  shines in the richly drawn jungle backgrounds and the brilliant musical  score (recorded by the Japanese Philharmonic Orchestra).  The action is  quick, with lots of plot crammed into each 25-minute episode.  The  characters are usually talking (fast) or running somewhere, creating a  hyperkenetic feel.
But what sets this cartoon apart is the story telling  and character development.  Kimba the white lion loses his parents early in  life, and inherits the nearly impossible job of bringing peace and justice  to the jungle.  He proceeds by taking clues from the better aspects of  human civilization, for instance establishing a farm and an ""animal  restaurant"" (in Vol. 2) to ameliorate the constant battles over food.  He relates to the other animals of his ""kingdom"" more like a  playmate than a ruler, being a pre-adolescent throughout the series.  A  pacifist at heart, Kimba only fights when he has to ... which turns out to  be really quite often.  He isn't perfect though, and his friends (or the  memory of his father) sometimes have to correct him when he's wrong.  He  often struggles with moral dilemmas and self-doubt (as in the episode  ""Jungle Thief""), and sometimes he even comes close to despair.  But he's the leader we all wish we had, and the leader we all wish we could  be.
Granted, not everyone is going to like these cartoons.  The animation  pales next to higher budget films.  And much of ""Kimba's"" appeal  rests on its die-hard idealism, not pointed wit or irony.  Is it just  childhood nostalgia, or would I still like ""Kimba"" even if I saw  it for the first time today?  I can't be completely sure.  But I do know  this:  ""Kimba"" was the only TV show I saw as a kid that actually  had a positive influence on me.  Watch it and decide for yourself if you  like it; I'm an unapologetic Kimba fan.  Go, White Lion!",955584000,23,2258,4.839050131926121

7895913,4,6305791163,"Some fond memories of this show, however, did not remember how scary it was (especially for my four year old).  While the art is intriguing and in it's own right wonderful, it would regretfully become harder for this adult to appreciate if it this was playing all day long at my house.  Many of the action scenes are simply on loops for example.  Maybe when my son is older.",1402531200,3,374,4.391304347826087
7895914,4,6305791163,"Funny, I used to love Kimba as a kid and thought my 10 year old would too when I bought this tape.  When I saw it again for the first time in 35 years, I thought what terrible quality and script.  Meanwhile my 10 year old was loving it.  You might think Disney should be sued for copyright violation when you see the amazing similarity with The Lion King.  The theme song still haunts me.",1187827200,,388,4.133333333333334
7895915,4,6305791163,"I remember this series since I was 5 or 6. It left me pleasant memories and a story of a good young lion that was a role model for me, even if I'm not a vegetarian.
I bought if for my daughter of 2. After the spectacular images of A bug's life and Lion King, at the beginning she snobbed Kimba the White lion, whose pictures are now a little bit disappointing and outdated. However, Kimba is a hero and the story is too strong that overcomes the age and wrinkles of the film. Apart from the first episode, where the authors hadn't kids in mind while writing the script, the following episodes are more digestible for a kid slightly older than 2.
I give a four stars for the sound which is old and it's not clear whether it is the tape or something else. Moreover, if you love special effects, Kimba is a bit too primitive.",1028937600,2,822,4.208860759493671
7895916,5,6305791163,"Great tape! My 5 year old son loves to watch Kimba. I regret that I hesitated buying this tape because of the other persons review. This tape brings back great memories, for all of us who were born around 1960. The shows on the tape are the earlier ones of kimba. The soundtrack and dialogue is just as I remembered it. It's a very simplistic cartoon by todays standards but, my kids and I still enjoy it. Kimba teaches kids and reminds adults the value of morals and doing what's right.",1003795200,6,487,4.362637362637362
