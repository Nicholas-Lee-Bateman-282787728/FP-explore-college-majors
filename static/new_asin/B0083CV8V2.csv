8524433,1,B0083CV8V2,"I love this movie, and this copy is clean and well done-
but-
it is in 3D - obscure 3D
the film was not created in 3d
but more important
there is no Non 3d version available -
I have looked diligently.
Whoever makes this DVD
please make one with out 3D so we can actually see this amazing Movie.
The better done version on Youtube is taken off

(Amazon - you were swell- sent it to me safe and sound and quick)",1356912000,19,410,3.9397590361445785
