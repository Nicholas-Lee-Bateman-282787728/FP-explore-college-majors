7992875,4,B00009RGBN,"I have already purchased this once, but it got lost, so I purchased it again.

The history of cslewis is unique in that despite his vast knowledge from learned universities, his spiritual knowledge had yet to be tapped. His emergence into this world, the world he created on page, and the world he created for himself and for Joy and her sons is a fasinating story in itself.

It also brings in characters and authors from the same time period that might not be expected....JRR Tolkien, for one.",1272844800,,495,4.613636363636363

7992877,5,B00009RGBN,"The beauty of the Oxford campus and the natural wildness of the English countryside is captured in especially warm images. This documentary goes into more details and shows C.S. Lewis' home on a sunny day with a garden in full bloom. The camera sweeps across Oxford, showing statues, focusing in on the detailing on iron gates and shows people wandering about on Addison's walk.

Within the story of his life, Lewis Scholars present their ideas about his life and give glowing testimonials of his work. They explain how the unifying elements in his writing gives them appeal to all denominations and comment on how he would have reacted to his work being adapted for film.

It is fun to learn about how he loved to read Medieval romances and that he responded to all his letters while he continued to teach and publish even more books. His friendship with Tolkien is briefly discussed and they mention how Tolkien disliked the mixing of mythologies. They also show original drawings and pictures from the The Chronicles of Narnia.

In the past few years I've been researching more of the life of C.S. Lewis and have begun to read more of his work. ""The Magic Never Ends"" is perhaps the perfect C.S. Lewis Biography for those interested in his scholarly pursuits. There are also quite a few extras to enjoy:

Introduction to C.S. Lewis

Tour of The Kilns

Tour of the Cotswolds and Oxford University

Interview with the Writer/Director

Bibliography - A section that includes a listing of 38 books written by C.S. Lewis and numerous books written about his life. My personal favorites are ""A Grief Observed,"" and ""Mere Christianity.""

7992878,5,B00009RGBN,"I saw this last night on PBS and was very pleased with the presentation.  I was almost afraid to watch as I am used to seeing the courage and faith and humanity of well known people debunked (probably in an effort to make the documentary more interesting) but it didn't happen here.  Even the wild speculation about a possible intimate relationship between Lewis and Mrs. Moor was handled as it probably is (the usual spontaneous curiousity that springs into the mind when unmarried and unrelated individuals of the opposite sex live under one roof...gosh, aren't we liberated though).

  I think that the factual material about Lewis's theology and conversion and faith, and his relationship with his wife Joy was

was treated in a most believable (read: true) way.  It was surprising that, as used to sensationalist reporting as I am,  the presentation did not come off boring.  Maybe I'm weird, but the documentary kept me hanging on every word.",1134086400,36,948,4.911949685534591
7992879,5,B00009RGBN,"I really loved this documentary. Not only do you get to see where Lewis lived, played, wrote and worked, but you get a real sense of the mood of the era. Coupled with very professional production, there are great interviews of folks who studied with Lewis, knew him from other venues or were otherwise profoundly shaped by his works. Each interview sheds light on the value of Lewis for both his own age and ours, and why he gains more respect and readers each year.

Also, if you like the dvd, get the book by the same title. Very fun to read! Enjoy!",1133136000,15,551,4.349514563106796
7992880,4,B00009RGBN,"This DVD works best as an introduction and/or a dialogue about C.S. Lewis' life and influence, particularly within the Christian context.  C.S. Lewis experts, many of whom are from Wheaton College, discuss Lewis' relationship with Mrs. Moore, the influence of his colleagues like Tolkien, and Lewis' profound effect and affect on Christian thought through his writings and lectures.

Some of the dialogue is really of little use like speculating about his relationship with Mrs. Moore, for the relationship is a pre-occupation with sensationalism more than rigorous thought; however, many of the discussions do provide a nice framework for understanding Lewis's writings and life.  I think it is interesting to see Debra Winger interviewed since she is not a Christian.  In this case, it adds to the discussion since she brings a positive perspective about Lewis' approach.

It was nice to see Lewis' stepson, Douglas Gresham, who brings an eye-witness account to the discussion as well as Walter Hooper.  Overall, this is a nice production and interesting hour spent discussing C.S. Lewis and his profound influence on Christian culture.

The narration by Sir Ben Kingsley properly fits this DVD.",1131235200,18,1197,5.335106382978723
7992881,5,B00009RGBN,"I watched this the other evening and found it to be both educational and enjoyable for the ""journey further on and deeper in.""  Traveling to Lewis' England, the 1-hour tour visits his old haunts including the Kilns, Oxford and Cambridge, the countryside trails he strolled, and an array of other meaningful places in his life. It is divided into several parts- early life, academic as a non-Christian and as a Christian, his literary career, and his life with his wife, Joy. Interspersed are short snippets from interviews of such notables as his stepson, Douglas, and Walter Hooper. Several others add to the uniqueness of this video by offering personal remembrances and anecdotes that bring insight into Lewis the man, the author, the teacher, and the friend.
The book that is an accompaniment to this video, under the same title, is very much worth reading and is, if one must choose, more useful for those Lewis buffs who want to know more about the man behind the page.
My only critique of the video is that it should have been longer with more time given to the interviews. Even so, it is really a lovely documentary of an amazing man.",1065225600,13,1142,4.738693467336684
