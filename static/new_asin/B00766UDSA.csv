5057306,1,B00766UDSA,"This sad creature was born male, but appeared female; he/she pursued fame for its own sake, which is a waste of a God-given life. Yes, Lou Reed wrote a song about her misadventures. So what? We need virtuous models, not sad and sordid sojourners of the perverse.

One story sums it up. A man relates this first meeting with Darling. He says, ""It may have been how I was raised, but I went out in the street and threw up."" That was the gastronomically correct response to someone who abuses and mutilates themselves in that way. God have mercy.",1363305600,3,543,4.484848484848484
5057307,5,B00766UDSA,"""Beautiful Darling"" is a very poignant film. Candy Darling was discovered by Andy Warhol and she appeared in ""Flesh"" and ""Women in Revolt"" both directed by Paul Morrissey. Candy was biologically male but took estrogen which did increase her female appearance. She worked hard at being a woman more than Warhol's other two ""transvestite"" stars: Jackie Curtis and Holly Woodlawn. Candy was a transsexual but hesitated having a sex change. One reason may very well have been that she didn't have the money. Her idol was Kim Novak and Candy spoke like her and acted like her in many ways.
Candy was intelligent and readings from her journals reveal her inner thoughts which were sometimes very sad because she was an outcast.
Her very good friend, Jeremiah Newton, adds a great deal to the film. Others who share their memories of Candy include Holly Woodlawn, Paul Morrissey, Jayne County, Fran Leibowitz and several others. I only wish that there was more information on the other films she appeared that were not associated with the Andy Warhol Factory. This could have easily been a longer film. It left me wanting more. No mention is made that Candy had a half-brother from her mother's previous marriage who would have nothing to do with Candy.
Candy Darling had a presence and she could have done cabaret like Holly Woodlawn and Jackie Curtis did in after Andy Warhol quit using ""transvestites"" in his films.
This film is worth every cent! I also have ""Superstar in a Housedress"" about Jackie Curtis. The two films are ones I highly recommend. Candy Darling is worth remembering and, if you are unfamaliar with her, she is well worth learning about. She is utterly fascinating. Buy this documentary. You won't regret it.",1362096000,6,1723,4.8839590443686

5057311,5,B00766UDSA,"""Beautiful Darling"" is a documentary film about the actress and Andy Warhol Superstar Candy Darling; she was born a boy but transformed herself into a beautiful blonde ""movie star"" before dying tragically young. I saw this film when it was in the theater: I was taken by the poster, which is the same image as on the DVD cover, and walked in off the street knowing pretty much nothing about Candy Darling. I was in for a 100% pleasant surprise as I was deeply moved by this story of an outsider trying to make his/her way in life. Though I am not gay or transgender or particularly interested in art or really anything that you would think this film would be exclusively about, I found myself relating to Candy and her odd, inspiring life -- it's really a film about a person who is just trying to find her way, trying to figure out who she is and how she can overcome the obstacles that life has put in her way.  It wasn't easy, but she succeeded and her story is both sad and strangely uplifting. Also, there is a lot of really great archival footage here, lots of great music, and lots of great interviews with a cast of real interesting characters (some famous, some not so much so) who knew and worked with Candy. They bring great insight and aren't dry or boring at all. One note: You have to watch the film to the very end of the credits. The actress Chloe Sevigny reads Candy's letters and diaries throughout (and does a beautiful job; I don't think I've ever heard do voice work before; she should do more), but when she comes back rather unexpectedly toward the end of the closing credits to read one last thing . . . it is a real heart killer.  An excellent film, highly recommended -- it was in lots of big film festivals and got glowing reviews, so obviously I'm not the only one who thinks so.",1336348800,13,1807,4.359050445103858
5057312,5,B00766UDSA,"Having seen many of Paul Morrissey directed/Andy Warhol produced films like FLESH and TRASH, I was somewhat familiar with the performing side of transgendered glamour queen, Candy Darling.  But, after watching this fantastic documentary I realized that I knew nothing about the personal side of this beautiful, but very sad and lonely woman.  Candy Darling grew up in a cookie cutter suburb of New York around people who could just as well have been from another planet.  There was nothing in the life or routine of those early surroundings that inspired the slightest level of comfort or self-esteem in a boy who wanted to be a glamorous girl.  But, a move to New York in Candy's early teens changed everything, and eventually led her to the great heights of fame that she dreamed of.  Yet, through it all was a nagging loneliness that eventually consumed Candy and played a pivotal role in her desire to simply die when she was diagnosed with Lymphoma at age 28.  The nice thing about Candy is that her fame lives on through this very generous and affirming documentary.  In fact, the film proves that nothing works better at helping us understand those whose realities lie far outside the mainstream than witnessing a heavy dose of their vulnerable humanity.  Strongly recommended!",1331164800,25,1284,4.912037037037037
5057313,4,B00766UDSA,"I just watched this on Netflix.  Although I do not go out of my way to watch documentaries or things centered chiefly around LGBTQ materials, this was actually quite a story.  Candy was a boy from the suburbs who was, like so many, not like other boys.  In his teens, he moved to New York and was lucky enough to come into The Factory and meet a lot of Andy Warhol's crew.  She made it into a few of his movies, and, like so many that came into Warhol's house, he got his 15 minutes and then went poof.  Candy's story was rather sad in that the boy he was has been lost, as his mother remarried a man who was clearly ashamed of her ""famous son"" and all of his things from childhood were thrown out (as his friend trying to dig up and preserve everything he could on him).  You felt the loneliness as so many can somewhat relate to at one point or another, but this life was probably one of the more lonely ones.  And the greatest tragedy of them all is that one day Candy found something hard in her abdomen, found out she had a tumor from abusing too many female hormones, and a few weeks later died at age 28.  His friend was probably the most moving of them all, as all these years later he still cares for her and wanted to give Candy's ashes a proper burial in a cemetery and keep all of his meager things.  All he is or was is still on film in the world, but to see that a person has been reduced to nothing but a few scribbled notes and random photographs is what's really sad.  He quite honestly did not have the most talent of anyone trans or not, but he lived and he made a small mark on the world.",1417478400,,1608,4.044164037854889

5057316,5,B00766UDSA,"Documentary about Candy Darling the Beautiful Transgender enigma that was a staple at Andy Warhol's factory which had three different locations between 1962 and 1984. The original Factory was on the fifth floor at 231 East 47th Street, in Midtown Manhattan. Candy also starred in many of Andy's films and was in""SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS"" a play by Tennessee Williams.

Lou Reed even wrote ""Take a Walk On The Wild Side"" about Candy and Holly Woodlawn""

It's a very intimate look inside the life of Candy who was worshiped and adored by the avant garde crown in NYC during the late 60's and early 70's up until her untimely death an age 29 in 1974.

Rare interviews, Pictures commentary from the people who knew her best and more. it's quite tragic but at the same time she really 'Lived"" and didn't waste a second of what time she did have.

Always conflicted about her body and who and what she was. Also who and what other people would think she was, although she made no attempt to hide the fact that she was indeed a pre op Transsexual,that was her meal ticket,that's what set her apart from all the other beautiful women in New York,she was fabulous and all eyes were on her. She loved and craved the spotlight but at the same time she wanted to have a husband and a family like any other woman.

Most wanted to gawk at her. She was so beautiful and so feminine that people especially men became so infatuated with her but she never knew if they really liked/loved her or the ""novelty"" that was Candy Darling.
A feeling I knew all too well.

""I will not cease to be myself for foolish people. For foolish people make harsh judgments on me. You must always be yourself, no matter what the price. It is the highest form of morality.""

5057317,5,B00766UDSA,"This documentary is a phenomenally thoughtful, nuanced presentation both of the life (and death) of Candy Darling, star in many of Andy Warhol's films, and of the human experience of trans-sexuality.  Thru the use of exceptionally well-done close juxtapositions of comments from key people in her life, along with much footage of her in and out of movies, one can begin to experience something of what this individual faced in life.  In learning of the experience of this (and of other) transgender individuals, one's own understanding of what it is to be human is significantly expanded, in addition to expected specifics relating to issues of gender and sexuality.

True, Candy's life experience was mostly in a kind of hot-house world of the Andy Warhol ""factory"" and its crowd, and involved a great deal that many of us outside of the world of theater and fashion ... let alone way beyond the edge avante-guard theater and fashion... might find alien and/or superficial.  Certainly that world is mostly alien to mine (that of a physician and electronics designer).  Yet her feelings, her un-requited wants in the face of a hateful, homophobic, and ignorant (with respect to the transgender reality and experience) world as presented here are universal.

This is truly exceptional and moving documentary cinema.

If you are unacquainted with such issues, after or before seeing this movie, I also VERY VERY highly recommend you obtain and view Middlesexs / Redefining He and She, dirceted by Antony Thomas, and narraged by Gore Vidal.  available for purchase here on Amazon.  The two go together very well.

She was so beautiful and interesting and being a transsexual myself in the process of transitioning I am eager to learn about my people from the past who was not afraid to be themselves. Especially back then when the ignorance of ""these types of people"" was very high. I'm not saying it's not difficult now but they didn't have the resources back then. Back then they believed these people should put away from society. But about the film. It was very thorough and well put together. I enjoyed it immensely and it really showed the life that she had.

8510750,4,B00766UDSA,"James Slattery aspired to be a gorgeous, glamorous female star in the mold of Kim Novak hoping it would bring him film opportunities, adoration, and fame. As a child, he hoped for acceptance, love, and support, but only found ridicule, alienation, and loneliness. Beautiful Darling is the bittersweet story of James Slattery/Candy Darling as told through narrative, diary entries, photos, videoclips, and interviews. Interviews include anecdotes about Candy and Warhol's Factory scene with personalities, celebrities, and filmmakers such as Jayne County, Penny Arcade, Holly Woodlawn, Taylor Mead, Gerard Malanga, John Waters, and Paul Morrissey. These entertaining clips bring insight into Candy's personality, but they're far too short and scattered, resulting in a hastily produced, unfocused documentary. It would have been fully absorbing had the filmmaker/editor known where to cut, but the rushed pace often leaves the viewer feeling frustrated and uttering a chain of ""but wait""s and ""hold on""s wanting to hear more. Had the filmmaker included more interview clips with Candy's close friend, Jeremiah Newton, these sincere, heartfelt memories of Candy would have provided the film with what it lacks: a deeper perspective.

Beautiful Darling should interest even those unfamiliar with the larger-than-life trio of Candy, Jackie Curtis, and Holly Woodlawn. NYC hosted an era of unforgettable figures in the 60's and 70's, and these three brought something much more than entertainment. Had they been given a more prominent spotlight, they could have amused many more people and likewise given them reasons to question society and its conservative norms.

I would have liked to lose myself in this documentary, but it seems as if it was edited for viewers with short attention spans. If you enjoy Beautiful Darling, I recommend the better focused and more enjoyable Jackie Curtis documentary: Superstar in a Housedress. (3.5 stars)",1480204800,,1937,5.54054054054054
