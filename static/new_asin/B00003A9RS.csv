7917121,3,B00003A9RS,"I was frankly disappointed by the treatment this very interesting
man got in the usually excellent American Experience series on the Presidents.  This man faced more difficult decisions upon entering office than almost any other President besides Abraham Lincoln and it took a man of unusual character to be able to face up to the challenges that were thrust upon him.  The film does point up the problems he faced upon entering office such as the decision to use the Atomic Bomb on Japan and the need for the United States economy to go off a war-footing without causing massive unemployment, but after this  it goes down hill.
I am also unhappy with the way the decision to use the A-bomb was presented.  Although it makes clear that, from Truman's and the other national leaders' point of view, there was no choice, they claim that he felt defensive about the decision in following years, although he denied it.  I don't think that was the case at all.  They claim that instead of dropping the bomb, he could have blockaded Japan instead, but an objective look at this option shows that far, far more Japanese would have died from famine, disease and civil disorder that would have resulted from blockade than from use of the two bombs that were dropped, so I don't see how that would have been a more ""humane"" decision.
Truman's handling of the nationwide rail strike is shown and the 1948 election upset is explained, pointing out that even the people who voted from Truman thought he would lose to Dewey.
The biggest failure of the film is that almost nothing is described about what happened in his second term, except for the Korean War and his firing of General MacArthur along with his threatening letter sent to music critic Paul Hume who panned his daughter's singing performance.  While it is pointed out that when Truman left office, his approval rating was lower than that of President Nixon's when he resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal, it is not mentioned that, in addition to the unpopular Korean War stalemate that he was not able to end, there were several corruption scandals within his Administration that played a major role in eroding his reputation.  In addition,
the assassination attempt by Puerto Rican nationalist extremists on Truman is not even mentioned.
Another criticism I have is that it is claimed that Truman exaggerated the Communist threat to Western Europe in order to get Congressional support for the Truman Doctrine including aid to Turkey and Greece as well as the Marshall Plan.  The Communist
threat to the West in the post-War period has been proven in recent years to be more serious than was believed by many at the time.
We are shown many love letters Truman sent to his wife Bess, but I don't understand why, if they were so close, Bess decided to spend most of the time he was President at home in Independence, Missouri leaving him alone in the White House.  Saying she ""hated to be First Lady"" doesn't answer this because he had been in politics for many years so she must have adjusted to it. Almost every picture shown of her shows her with a scowl in the frumpy clothes she liked wearing.
In spite of these criticisms, this film is still worth watching to see how a President who had to fill the immense shoes of the legendary Franklin D Roosevelt managed to leave a",1102809600,3,3334,4.693493150684931
7917122,3,B00003A9RS,"American Experience biographies are usually exceptionally well-produced and narrated. Generally they are the definitive  examination of their  subjects, but they dropped the ball in this look at the life of Harry  Truman. Truman led a fascinating and multi-faceted existence, but the  entire documentary falls flat. The only riveting segment was the coverage  of the '48 Truman-Dewwy campaign, but the coverage of Truman's early life  and later years was disappointing. There is scant illumination of the life  of Bess, Harry's beloved wife and an integral part of his story.
Truman  lived for another 20 years after he left the White House, but you'd never  know it from this treatment. They blandly narrate Harry's remaining years  in a few minutes and then hastily conclude the biography. It's a shame  because Truman is an American icon and deserves a fresh, vibrant treatment.  This is perhaps the most disappointing American Experience biography I have  yet seen.",966211200,11,969,5.296052631578948
