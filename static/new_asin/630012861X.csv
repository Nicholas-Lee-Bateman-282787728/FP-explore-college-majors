I'd heard of Bakshi and had seen other flicks of his, but was wholly unprepared, yet fantastically impressed and  successfully unnerved by Street Fight. It definitely parallels Disney's  Song of the South in its storyline, but updates it through the paranoia  between and among races during the time. Almost hypnotizing is the  ""church"" scene with the pseudo-Sharpton. Very disturbing. This is  a must see for anyone with an iron stomach who can laugh while taking it to  the jaw. A disturbingly great night can be had by watching Song of the  South, taking a long, deep, fortifying breath, and then watching Street  Fight. Make sure the kids are not only out of the room, but out of the  house. Walt Disney this is not.",931219200,2,816,4.611111111111111

For years the title was unavailable on video and has just been  released un-edited.  This is a definite must see!  And also Scat-Man  Crouthers steals the show.

208819,4,630012861X,...I must say that the first time I saw this movie I felt sick to my stomach. Being African American I was offended by the characitures of the black characters though Bakshi was sending a message aimed at not only at a black audience but everybody about the hardships of African American life but then which I guess was in the early seventies. In the beginning you Scatman Crothers little catchy song which makes sense if you'd read some Richard Wright in your time.  But people who aren't familar with Bakshi's films may immediately take offense especially African Americans but the movie sends a message without being too preachy.  Check it out.

208822,4,630012861X,"A fan of Bakshi's work I was ecstatic when I finally found this under its original title of Coonskin after an eight or nine year search. WHOA MOMMA!! Bakshi translates the tales of Br'er Rabbit and the Tar Baby to Urban Decay USA and lets rip against the greedy, liars, cheats and creeps of society, by combining all the elements from his previous two films into one angry melting pot.
Recycling the live action element, human characters and personal recollections from his second film ""Heavy Traffic"" and the political, animal character fantasies of his interpretation of ""Fritz the Cat"", in this Blaxpoitation inspired tale of three friends who attempt to knock the Godfather out of Harlem, Bakshi has created some of the most unbelievable and disturbing animation ever. Bear witness to phony evangalists, pimps, corrupt cops, criminals and revolutionary ideas that flow through the film like some hullucinogenic nightmare. When the film was released in 1975, it was pulled within a week of its release due to vehement protests by the political group CORE against what they perceived to be blatant racism against African-Americans. Certainly most of the blacks in the film are portrayed in an ugly light, but who in this film is not?! Black, White, Italian or Jew no-one comes out of this film untouched and ultimately (at least to me) it did not seem racist to anyone group, just very angry towards the corruption, greed and dishonesty that perpetrates itself at any level of society. Bakshi uses live action on its own (to set up and complete the story) and a mix of live-action and animation in the story itself (live backgrounds with animated characters). While most of the solely live-action bits are pretty weak (despite having the immensely talented Scatman Crothers in them), and some of the animation looks cheap, when the mix is right the film SOARS! This film contains some of the most unbelievable scenes I have ever seen! The aforementioned phony evangilist, a very funny funeral sequence and the absolute highlight of an LSD trip that wrenches out all the bad thoughts and ideas of its victim and gives him a suitable comeuppance. HEAVY HEAVY STUFF. I especially liked the way he introduced the chracters against a Warner Bros animation background.
Despite the somewhat abrupt and confusing ending and the fact that I wished there was more animation than there was, I admire Bakshi very much for having the guts to do this. Powerful, heartfelt, funny, surrealistic, and exceedingly angry and confronting this is not a film for all tastes. However, it is obviously recommended for fans of Bakshi and people with open minds who know that films like this do not get made today and that if they did Barry White would not be starring in them.",992304000,13,2753,4.922580645161291
208823,4,630012861X,"Coonskin (AKA - Streetfight) is one of those films that really peels the veneer of sweetness as in Disney's Song of the South right off and kicks all barriers down. Coming off of the success of Fritz and Heavy Traffic, Bakshi recruited some of the hottest black animators to make a true-to-life and gritty portrait of black life in Harlem. What Bakshi serves up is an icicle to brain. The imagery is fantastic - the black ""Jesus"" (how's my teeth?), the shefiff, the Godfather (oh, so foul, bloated, festering - a very different version than seen in HT) and his sons (what a riot), Miss America, and our heroes. The Voices are great choices for the parts - Charles Gordone as the Preacher Fox, the smooth Barry White as Samson the Bear, Philip Michael Thomas (a good decade before Miami Vice) as Brother Rabbit, and the always enjoyable Scatman Crothers as the Old Man.
Not the best Bakshi film (it feels a little sloppy and rushed at the end - esp. the boxing match) out there but one of the better - far superior to Hey Good Lookin' which was made at the same time but not released till '81. As usual Bakshi captures the feel of the time and anyone that was there can attest to this. Bakshi is a man of magic - he may not be to everyone's taste but he is worth checking out. His films are like none other - and as always Not For Children - this ain't Disney's Uncle Remus telling you a story instead of ""Zippity Do Da"" you get ""Papa needs a new pair of shoes"".",991612800,3,1461,4.316363636363636

208825,4,630012861X,"The early works of Ralph Bakshi remain his strongest. It is in the mean streets of New York where his voice resonates. I heard about this film (originally titled ""Coonskin"") decades ago when Ralph Bakshi was  a guest on the Tomorrow show with Tom Snyder.  Subsequently I never heard  of it since.  Then I saw ""Wizards"" and remembered ""This is  that 'Coonskin' director!"" Shortly thereafter he made ""Lord of  the Rings"", a departure from his asphalt roots. Along with ""Heavy  Traffic"" and ""Hey Good Lookin'"", ""Streetfight"" is  a brutally honest look at life among folks Disney wouldn't touch with a  ten-meter Mouse prod! It's mix of animated characters against live action  backgrounds add grittiness to his cartoon satire, giving a crude  grafittiesque flavor to a film that aptly covered much of the ground it's  taken Spike Lee several films to cover--and this is back when the Spikester  was still in junior high!

An unbelievably biting satire of 1970's society and Walt Disney's ""Song Of The South"", ""Street Fight"" was originally concieved and produced in 1975. Bookended by live action sequences starring R&B sensation Barry White, a pre-Miami Vice Phillip Micheal Thomas, Pulitzer Prize winner Charles Gordone, and the inimitable Scat Man Crothers, the film was intended to be a multi-leveled update of Br'er Rabbit gone to Harlem. An astonishing and ground-breaking attack on racism, on the surface this film appears to embody and embrace exactly sort of Stephen Fetchit/Uncle Tom/Uncle Remus stereotypes that it so successfully skewers.",1284940800,,835,6.5225225225225225

7803033,5,630012861X,"Coonskin is a masterpiece of hard-hitting satire and adult animation. It has a few flaws, but it is a great film and a showcase for Ralph Bakshi's brand of storytelling. It blends live-action and animation in fascinating ways. Live-action and animated characters will sometimes The story is actually two stories. In the live-action story, two men, The Preacherman (Pulitzer-prize winning playwright and actor Charles Gordone) and Sampson (singer Barry White), are on their way to break their buddy Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) out of prison. As Randy awaits their coming, the old man who helped him break out, Pappy (the Uncle Remus stand-in played by Scatman Crothers) recants tales of their animated counterparts Brother Rabbit (Thomas), Brother Bear (White), and Preacher Fox (Gordone). The animated segments concern their escapades in harlem, as brother Rabbit rises to power by eliminating racist cops and even The Godfather himself (played by Al Lewis, otherwise known as Grandpa Munster).

The film's strengths are numerous. The film has scenes of beautiful animation and experimentation. A great scene would be the death of the corrupt cop Madigan (voiced by Frank DeKova, who played Angelo Corleone in Heavy Traffic). This scene was animated by Ambi Paliwada, a former Disney animator. The scene is both grotesque and beautiful at the same time. Its use of caricature makes it powerful and almost poignant. That is an example of what animation does best, and that is use the art of caricature and exaggeration to drive home an emotion. Also, Ralph Bakshi likes to experiment and use collage in his films. The best example of this is a scene in which a woman describes a relationship she had with a cockroach. The animation of the woman is done all in silhouette, and the story is told in a very limited animation form. This serves as both a description of conditions of relationships between black men and women at the time, as well as a tribute to the Mulatto cartoonist George Herriman (especially his illustrations for the archy and mehitabel stories by Don Marquis). It is a beautiful scene that, while it doesn't serve the story, it shows the condition of the area the characters are moving into. Animation is also good at making visual poetry,as is evidenced in the scene where after The Godfather's wife is shot, she goes through a beautiful transformation into a butterfly. The film is filled with moments like that.

As I've mentioned before, animation relies on caricature, which is used to perfection in this film. The designs of the characters are cartoony and exaggerated, but's used to visually describe the characters in the film. It gives each character a distinct look that makes them unique. However, it is the caricatured visual aspects that was the reason that the film faced controversy. You see, Ralph Bakshi used these designs to force America to confront the racist imagery of our cultural history (Aunt Jemima, Pickaninnies, Amos 'n Andy, etc.). However, Bakshi's most savage satire is aimed not at blacks, but at the Mafia. Angered at the hero worship the Mob received after the release of the Godfather films, Bakshi presents them here as a group of sadistic, hedonistic, incestuous clods with no moral compass of any type.

Despite these strengths, the film suffers from not just from its limited budget, but also Bakshi's weakness as a storyteller. The limited budget meant Bakshi couldn't afford pencil tests, which is a way for animators to test their work before it's inked and painted. Because of this, the film also has moments of weak animation, where the characters don't feel to have any weight or there are weak drawings. The films biggest fault is the story.  Parts of it do not flow together, or they try to cram too much in one story, which wold be Bakshi's ultimate undoing in Wizards. With three main characters, certain characters fall into the background and will pop back up for no reason. Preacher Fox disappears for about a half hour without any real explanation. That, and the importance of the boxing match at the climax is never stated or shown, which kind of takes away the suspense. The topper is the ending of the film. It's never made clear on what exactly happens. It leaves you feeling a bit lost. One more small quibble with the film: sometimes the sexual imagery is carried a bit too far and seem excessive.

Ultimately though, that does not diminish my love of this film and my respect for Ralph Bakshi. While I feel it's not as good as Heavy Traffic, it is a brilliant film that should not be missed. However, be forewarned. This film requires more than one viewing in order for it to sink in. Also, this film will make people uncomfortable. I've had a friend ask me to stop the film. This is not for the weak of constitution. Happy Viewings.",1266537600,,4813,4.886168910648715
7803034,4,630012861X,"by Dane Youssef

""Coonskin"" (re-christened ""Street Fight"" for the logical sake of political correctness) is a film, by the one and only Ralph Bakshi, is reportedly a satricial indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at life black in modern America (modern for the day, I mean--1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame.

Since ""political correctness"" is very enforced in this country to the point of fascism--freedom of speech is being blacked-out of the Bill of Rights as I write this... the makers have re-dubbed the movie ""Street Fight."" It's a more family-friendly inoffensive title, yes.

Sadly, it's almost misleading as to what the film is all about. With the original ""Coonskin"" moniker, at least the movie makes good on it's threat.

But this is a Bakshi film, contraversal, thrilling, and a must-see almost by definition alone. Not just another random ""shock-jock"" of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock. It's by Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if HE made a movie, he has something big to say...

Although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation, ""Street Fight"" isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick. ""Street Fight"" wants to be more. It aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish.

The movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre. Nor does it just indict black people, but actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places.

""Street Fight"" tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break. The fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the ""Street Fight"" world alone makes it old-fashioned.

One of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in Harlem named Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means nessicary. The Itallian mob is running all the real action.

Big name black musicians star: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright to take home the Pulitzer. Something big is happening here obviously.

The movie plays out like a descent into this world, this side of the racial divide. From an angry, hip, deep, soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand.

Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word ""subtlety."" This one looks like it's never even heard of the word. But maybe a subject like this needs extremism. Real sledgehammer satire. Some subjects can't be tackled gently.

Bakshi is god dammed merciless. Here, no member or minority of the Harlem scene appears unscathed.

The characters here are ""animated"" to ""real"" all depending on what the mood and situation are. The animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally.

Bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value. He always has something to say. Nor is blackface is gratutiously. Here, unlike in Spike Lee's ""Bamboozled,"" he seems to be using it to try and really say something.

Like 99.9% of all of Bakshi's films, this one incorporates animation and live-action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here. All of this technique is all intertwined, meshing together while saying something.

Somehow, this one feels inevitably dated. Many of these types of films (Bakshi's included) are very topical, very spur of the moment. They reflect the certain trend for the day, but looking back of them years later, there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth).

Even though the music, clothes, slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter [...]. Anyone who's really seen the movies, the state of things and has been in company of the people know what I'm talking about.

Even some of the of the black characters are a bunny (jungle-bunny), a big ol' bear and a fox. One of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty Harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these ""[...]"" after the death of a cop. But for him, it's not just business. Nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield. It's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks.

The sequence involving the Godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film, of which there are many. It plays out like an opera or a ballet.

The promo line: WARNING: ""This film offends everybody!"" This is not just hype. Proceed with extreme caution.

I'm a Black American, and I loved this film. It was made in the middle 70s, so it only bears to reason why anyone in the PC crowd would dislike this film. Ralph took the still prevailing attitude about Black people and put it on the screen. Remember the breakthrough sitcom ""All in THe Family""? As my family and I watched the movie, my cousin was offended by the Scatman Crothers intro song at the beginning of the movie. He felt that it was putting down Black people, that it was ""too pickaninny!"" But in fact, it was right for the movie. The live action with Phillip Michael Thomas, Scatman Crothers, and Barry White justified it. The three of them are serving time in a prison in the deep south. (The setting gives that impression) They are planning an escape from the prison. Inbetween the planning and the actual escape, the story of Black Rabbit and his cohorts is told. There are a lot of racial over tones in the movie, but it is dealing with the attitude of the time. It was very symbolic. There was the ""white she devil"", the mob, and the fixing of boxing matches. Drug dealers ( called ""pushers"" back then), pimps and all the other typical blaxplotation items. If shown today, all the civil rights groups would be calling for Ralph's half moons. This a movie that needs to be on DVD very soon. As a people, Blacks need to lighten up and realize that this did go on and that this is how we were once upon a time, and that this is how we were seen.
