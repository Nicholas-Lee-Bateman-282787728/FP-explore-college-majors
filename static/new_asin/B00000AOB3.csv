1199104,5,B00000AOB3,"This series is one of few current television shows which deserve to be released on tape, in my opinion. (If that sounds like some old consevative busy-body attitude, I'll tell you now that I'm 15) I fell in love with this  show the first time I saw it. The tapes are wonderful, I hope they continue  releasing the later series(British version of seasons). The plot has been  fairly well explained by prior reviewers. The acting is superb, Dame Judi's  Jean and Geoffrey Palmer's Lionel are truly characters with whom you wish  you could visit.  I have yet to find any show which consistantly maintains  the level of intelligance and humor found in As Time Goes By. The eighth  season is just coming to America in the summer and fall 2000, I hope a  ninth will soon follow.",961459200,,772,4.576642335766423
1199105,5,B00000AOB3,"It would be easy to ascribe the success of _As Time Goes By_ to the excellent acting and writing.  But, in truth, I think the show endured for an unusually long time (by British standards) because it took basic format  risks that were uncommon to the general British comedy paradigm.  Chief  among these risks was the decision to make the storyline continue from  week-to-week.
Avoiding glib 30-minute resolutions to conflicts, the  characters are given time to demonstrate growth over time.  In many ways,  the construction of _As Time Goes By_ is that of a comedy wrapped in soap  opera.  While the basic impetus of the plot is that of Jean and Lionel  rekindling a long-lost relationship, their default wariness of that  possibility makes it nothing like a foregone conclusion.  At several points  in the whole of the series, you seriously have to wonder whether that  outcome will happen, much less if it is even likely.  At times, they even  date other people and have serious arguments-conditions which aren't  resolved neatly at the end of an episode, or even a season.  Imagine  watching the show in its first run, week-to-week, then having to wait a  year for the next season to start, and you'll understand why people kept  coming back to it.
Still, it's hardly fair to ignore the strength of the  acting.  Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench bring excellent writing to life in  performances which are consistently deft.  They've had a lifetime of  experiences since last they met, and they're not eager to take risks to  upset their lives--however beneficial the positive consequences of those  risks.  Icebergs melt more quickly than their reservations about each  other, but that's what we keep coming back for.
This first tape takes a  full three episodes to set up the basic story arc for the whole series.  In  them, we're introduced to the story of how they first met, fell in love,  and then were apparently dismissed by each other after Lionel went off to  the Korean War.  Jean has arguably the bigger problem with their  reintroduction because she owns the secretarial firm which is helping  Lionel finalize the draft of his novel, and so must form a professional  relationship with a man she thinks did her wrong decades ago.  Meanwhile,  Lionel must own up to his own disappointment at her never having returned  his letters from the front.
This then is an essential purchase if you  want to enjoy this series.  Though one could arguably start anywhere and  basically understand what's going on, their presence on video makes  out-of-order viewing unnecessary.  So pick this one up first.  By the end  of it, you'll definitely want to move on to volume two.",959990400,3,2675,4.861607142857143
1199106,5,B00000AOB3,"This is absolutely the most wonderfully written and acted British comedy series ever aired in the US! And between Geoffrey Palmer as Lionel and Philip Bretherton as Alistair (who happens to be gorgeous), I cannot imagine a show with handsomer leading men!  Of course, Judi  Dench is no slouch either and Moira Brooker is really charming, so there's  an excellent cast. The writing is very good - subtle humor and warmth that you  don't normally get from Britcoms. I can't help but gush - buy all of the videos and get to know these people!",956707200,,539,4.6421052631578945
1199107,5,B00000AOB3,I have seen all 54 eposides of As Time Goes By and every one is just as good as the last one.  It is a heartwarming series with wonderful acting.  Judi Dench and all the supporting cast are made for the parts they play.  It is so great to see that love can last so long in absence and bloom in  middle age again.  I have just ordered volumes 3 and 4 and am anxiously  awaiting the rest of the series.,947635200,5,400,3.876543209876543
1199108,5,B00000AOB3,"""As Time Goes By"" is one of the reasons the BBC has so many devoted fans.  This is an understated, humorous, warm and affectionate show about two people comfortably into their middle ages re-discovering each  other after an absence of 35 years.  This isn't teen angst.  It is  intelligent and slightly magical.  Geoffery Palmer is the coolest guy on  the planet, to boot. Treat yourself to this great tape.",942105600,6,406,4.797101449275362
1199109,5,B00000AOB3,"How we would love to *personally* know Jean, Lionel, Judy, Sandy and all the ""As Time Goes By"" gang. A true delight, we are enraptured by each episode. The writing is top notch, the actors simply superb. How  lovely to finally have the first 6 episodes of this superlative BBC series  on tape. We can only hope that the entire series will be offered on tape  soon. Hint?? Do yourself a favor and invite Jean and Lionel into your  life...they have found each other again and we are all the better for it. A  treasure from start to finish. Who is more delicious than Judi Dench and  Geoffery Palmer? When you tire of the network televison assault on your  senses...or their idea of what passes as *pleasant comedy*, pick up these  tapes, meet the gang and settle in to be delighted.",926899200,18,780,4.4822695035460995
7905810,5,B00000AOB3,I have a friend that likes the As Time Goes By series.  I buy them for her to give as gifts.,1359244800,,92,3.380952380952381
7905811,5,B00000AOB3,"I actually have a complaint about ""As Time Goes By,"" the British comedy about a second chance at love and laughter starring Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer.  I cannot stand the laugh track.  In the opening minute of Episode 1 the laugh track is employed several times and I am wondering what I missed that was so funny.  On more than one occasion in my life I have been the only one laughing in a theater at something, and I laugh all the time while watching shows on television alone down here in my little office, so I do not need to be prompted on when to laugh at something.  For a while I thought maybe I did not appreciate the British sense of humor as much as I thought I did, but I am pretty sure that is not the case.  The bottom line is that ""As Time Goes By"" does not need the bloody laugh track.
The premise of the show reminds me a bit of ""Love Among the Ruins,"" except that Dench and Palmer are not nearly as old as Katharine Hepburn and Laurence Olivier.  During the Korean War a dashing young British Army officer and a lovely student nurse fell in love and then he was shipped off to the war.  Lionel and Jean were star crossed, at least as far as the mails were concerned, and for forty years they have been wondering why the other one did not respond to their love letter.
Volume 1 offers up the first three episodes of the series from the 1993 season.  Episode 1 has Lionel, now a divorced coffee planter, taking up residence at a London hotel to finish his memoir about his life in Kenya, entitled, ""My Life in Kenya.""  He needs a temporary secretary and hires one from a local agency, never suspecting that it is owned by his former sweetheart, the now widowed Jean.  However, Jean's daughter Judith (Moira Brooker) is able to figure out enough to put two and two together.  That becomes Jean's primary concern in Episode 2, as she does her best to play matchmaker for her mother and Lionel.  At least the two end up actually spending time talking to one another.  Episode 3 finds Jean and Lionel spending the day together revisiting the romantic places of their past.  Of course, nothing is the same after forty years.
""As Time Goes By"" is a romantic comedy where the best comedy comes out of the romance, even if at this point it is simply memories of a romance long past.  The supporting characters are mostly comic foils and minor impediments to Lionel and Jean trying to rekindle their old magic.  But writer Bob Larbey and Producer/Director Sydney Lotterby are in no hurry to rush this renewed relationship or our enjoyment of it.  Do you think that someday if this was put out on a DVD it could have an audio option that would ditch the laugh track?",1044748800,3,2677,4.36491935483871
7905812,5,B00000AOB3,"This is the very beginning of a series that will knock your socks off. Dame Judi Dench plays Jean, a very strong, witty, and sexy older woman. Geoffrey Palmer portrays Lionel, a frustrating but lovable older man with a quick sarcastic wit. If you like British sitcoms, light comedies, soap operas, and good story lines, then you will like ""As Time Goes By"". Volume 1 sets up the series and gives you the premise of the story. The series gets increasingly better, and draws you in. It's really refreshing to see lovers that are older and realistic. Give this a try, you won't be sorry.",1021766400,4,584,4.571428571428571
7905813,5,B00000AOB3,"Witty, erudite, sensitive and incredibly funny, Dench and Palmer are perfectly matched in this ""real people"" British comedy.  ""Frasier"" fans will love it.",1017100800,2,154,5.695652173913044
7905814,3,B00000AOB3,"Leave it to the BBC to cover a subject in a sitcom that American TV probably wouldn't consider (or do well), a romance between a couple over fifty years of age.  I like the fact that the couple reunited after discovering they parted due to a misunderstanding years before.  The show doesn't depend on a lot of flash to get by; it's just a smart, gentle comedy.",1008806400,,360,4.358208955223881
7905815,5,B00000AOB3,"If you enjoy good dialogue and don't experience withdrawal pangs due to the total lack of video game visuals you just can't help loving this video.  If I had to pick a single series to watch, AS TIME GOES BY would definitely be my choice.  This video sets the characters and tone of the entire series and is just plain fun.  There are plenty of giggles, chuckles and some real guffaws in each episode.  The characters are well developed and just eccentric enough to be appealing.  It appears that the writers and producers of this one know what they did right.  You will too when you see it.",990316800,4,591,4.425925925925926
7905816,5,B00000AOB3,"This is my absolute favorite of the Britcoms. I discovered it on my local PBS station 3 or 4 years ago and gradually became totally hooked by the excellent acting and intelligent writing. This series has spoiled me for the mindless American comedy drivel we get most of the time--with one or two exceptions. What a treat to see Dame Judi playing so well off the low-keyed, droopy-faced, Geoffrey Palmer. He is absolutely 'brilliant'--as they say on the other side of the pond. If you're looking for intelligent romantic comedy, and enjoy the wry-on-toast British style, you'll like this series.",989884800,9,594,4.95
7905817,5,B00000AOB3,"Yes, we were all would love to live in that household!  Sandy should never  move out after Judy marries Alistar!  (Will we ever see a little Alistar,  Jr.?)  After immersing oneself in these shows you feel as if you know these  wonderful people!  Not only is it the most romantic comedy/drama ..dialogue  ;not leaving out the exquisite English vocabulary..but how would you love  to reside in Jean's kitchen forever and one could die in Lionel's manor  kitchen.  This tape(s) are a must for all Brit Com fans and absolutely  a must to introduce anyone to British tele...  Hope they make more and  more...one cannot get enough of this excellent show!",969321600,6,649,4.781818181818182
7905818,5,B00000AOB3,"As a long standing fan of British Comedies (or ""Britcoms"" as  they are referred to on BBC America) this series is one of my personal  favourites. In it, we meet Lionel and Jean. The pair (superbly played by  Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench)were once lovers during the Korean conflict.  Many years later, they rediscover each other. Their life together from that  point is the basis of this wonderful show.  To enjoy the series, you must  have a varied sense of humour. You must also understand Geoffrey Palmer's  very wry humour. Slapstick comedy is virtually nonexistent. So if you don't  care for any other type of humour, this series is not for you. This series  is for people like myself who like Judi Dench, semi-serious shows, and a  bit of romance mixed in.  If you enjoy any of the above, this wonderful  series is for you. My recommendation is to watch it on the BBC America  network (for those of you fortunate enough to have a satelite). See if you  enjoy it. If you do, then buy a few of the volumes from here. I guarantee  you won't be disappointed.",969062400,10,1061,4.534391534391534
