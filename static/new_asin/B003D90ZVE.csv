4111661,5,B003D90ZVE,The absolutely best betrayal of Jesus I have ever seen and enjoyed!  Appreciated it being word for word from the Bible making it an accurate portrayal.  So often movies made of Jesus take liberty to deviate from the Biblical narrative.  I can recommend this movie to other individuals who wish to increase their understanding of the life and events of Christ knowing that they are being given and accurate understanding of the gospel account avoiding later confusion and having to unlearn error.  Excellent!!!,1500508800,,509,5.096385542168675
4111662,4,B003D90ZVE,"I love that this movie follows the gospel of John word-for-word without adding or taking away. We enjoyed watching it as a family and I think it's a good way to visualize the Bible for kids. One thing greatly bothered me though: Mary Magdalene was NOT one of the disciples! I know there were some other flaws, but that was what bothered me most. I have yet to see a movie about the Bible where they don't add or take things away, so sad, because God's Word is perfect just the way it is!",1499731200,,487,4.191489361702128

4111668,5,B003D90ZVE,"Dialogue is the word for word : Authorized King James Version of the Gospel, according to John, ( the youngest apostle of Jesus Christ, while Jesus Christ lived on earth.) This is the witness account of John, the apostle , the follower of Jesus Christ, to the life of Christ .
It is recorded in writing by John who was the most loved of the apostles. His writing is short, clear and beautiful. It is the ONLY dialogue used in the dramatization of the film! The dialogue is so naturally performed by the cast, that I,myself,  doubted that it was not edited because it seemed so lifelike and modern! So I reached for my King James Bible and checked out, each chapter , word for word !  It is word for word, the correct , direct , authentic dialogue of the AUTHORIZED King James Version of the bible ! The cast of actors is from South America ; the environment and scenery are convincing and the dialogue is spoken in english.

4111672,5,B003D90ZVE,"I think that this movie was a good depiction of Jesus Christ. It teaches the nature of Jesus and his way of life. The acting was very powerful and the soundtrack for the movie was of equal high quality. It was a very captivating movie it invited people to take the journey to walk with Christ as he called his disciples, first teaching them, and then about the masses, then about himself and the kingdom of heaven. John proceeded with Jesus down the road to Calvary. Throughout the movie we were able to witness the different miracles that were performed. If you are Christian this is a must see because it gives you an insight on what the lord really did during those times, and how he influenced people to follow him. He had disciples go out and preach his word and it gave them a reason to believe and follow Jesus Christ.
In my world religions class our book states that the gospels described Jesus as a great teacher who astounded the crowds who gathered to hear him. It also teaches us students the teachings of Christianity, the life of Jesus, the teachings of Jesus, etc... The book also discuss the kingdom of god, which are all things that were discussed, and discussed well, in the movie. This movie really educated the Christians and non-Christians about the journey of Jesus Christ.  It focuses on Christs life including his birth, baptism, first miracle, healing the blind man, walking on water, feeding the multitude, raising Lazarus from the dead, the Last Supper, his flogging and crucifixion, and most importantly his resurrection. All things that enhance Christian beliefs. If one is unsure about the Christian religion, this movie would be a great help to get a better understanding of Jesus and all his spiritual achievements.",1478995200,,1747,4.765676567656766
4111673,5,B003D90ZVE,Absolutely there for all to see. You want the actor to be the real Jesus.,1477353600,,73,3.933333333333333

4111677,5,B003D90ZVE,This is one of my favorites. This is word for word drama. If you saw the tv show Lost you may get messed up that Damian is Jesus. This was difficult for me. But such a good movie and he did a wonderful job.,1471824000,,206,3.7045454545454546

4111688,5,B003D90ZVE,"The Gospel of John movie begins depicting the ministry of John the Baptist, who was the one crying in the wilderness. He was making the pathway straight for the coming of the Lord. John is the one who establishes the way of Jesus. After Jesus I introduced, the movie takes us down the path that Jesus walked such as choosing his disciples, teaching them the way, the synagogues, about who he is and about Heaven. He also depicts the Life of Jesus going to Calvary, performing miracles, and the many that tried to destroy him. Jesus then arrives at Golgotha, which is called, ""the place of the skull"", and shows plenty of passion for the people. We cannot forget the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which shows the risen Savior, the last days with his disciples, and returning back to his father in Heaven.

There are some inconsistencies in which I don't agree. The movie is taken from scripture, but not the King James Version, which is the original 1611 version. I think that scripture should be quoted accurately and not watered down. Also some, other inconsistencies, the movie doesn't really depict what Christ went through, it shows a whip, but not the real scourging and beating. I know that this version is taken from John's point of view, in which all the gospels depicts Jesus life and what he went through different.

The dramatization of this movie does depict some authenticity with the dress wear of the actors.  It always makes a difference with the music, clothing, because some movies go just a little bit to far to take a movie and add props that didn't exist in the biblical times. So I think that this movie does have some authenticity to it to make us feel like we were there...I would recommend this movie because it brings some biblical times to life.",1459728000,,1772,4.654952076677317

4111692,5,B003D90ZVE,"An outstanding dramatic presentation of the Gospel of John, using the Gospel alone as the script.

I bought additional copies to give to family members.",1451001600,,342,4.34375

4111704,5,B003D90ZVE,"I questioned how much I'd like the video when I saw the translation they used, but since I thought the other two videos of The Visual Bible were fabulous, I decided to get it and see how it worked out.  I completely enjoyed the story.  John continued the wonderful job that the producers and actors did in Acts and Matthew, bringing the characters to life, and especially how they portrayed Jesus with real emotions, intensity, softness, and strength, instead of the staid, overly calm person often portrayed.  I've watched it three times now, and each time was as enjoyable as the first.  Using the Good News Translation seemed to make it more like the telling of the story, sounding less ""scripture-y,"" yet leaving everything in there.",1440288000,,737,4.825396825396825

Viewers unfamiliar with the Bible will be shocked when they see and hear what the true Jesus of The Bible said, as opposed to the Barney-Jesus that the people have been led to accept.  I can't recommend this movie enough, its truly amazing and a blessing to any one that will watch it in it's entirety.  The gospel isn't hatred nor bigotry, but LOVE.  We have all sinned and therefore deserve a just punishment, but Jesus Christ took our punishment instead -if only we will surrender ourselves to Him and Him alone.

Offers easy access to the story of Jesus to those who would never pick up a Bible or know where to start. This is a great place!  Even though I'm a Bible-believing Christian, I find most Bible movies impossible to get through. If they are faithful to the BIble story, I'm bored because I know everything that's going to happen, including all the dialogue. So there's no curiosity to continue. But if the film departs from scripture in an effort to be original or creative, I'm angry at the changes, especially if there's some non-scriptural innuendo or distortion. But for those new to the Bible, this film is an appealing option, like having the Bible read TO you and watching a movie at the same time! Goes down easy!",1427932800,,831,4.731034482758621

I purchased it to show to my 4th/5th/6th grade Sunday School class during this season of Lent.  I do not regret it - I thank God for leading me to it.

4111723,5,B003D90ZVE,"This movie is the best movie I have ever seen on the life of Christ for one very important reason: there is no artistic license and a real sensitivity to the 1st century setting of Christs life.

The movie is a word-for-word dialog (with a few omissions for time) of the Gospel of John in the Good News Bible, it contains many historical nuances, and it is superbly acted.

Gone is the spacy drugged Jesus portrayed by Robert Powell in Jesus of Nazareth, the frivolous Jesus portrayed by Jeremy Sisto in Jesus, the anhedonic Jesus portrayed by Max von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, or the dark and grimy Jesus portrayed by Jim Caviezel in The Passion of Christ. Henry Ian Cusicks portrayal of Jesus is eminently believable. Jesus smiles appropriately, he walks without affectation, he ponders with the normal momentary removal from the immediate and as if genuinely considering something in his minds eye, and he rages with authentic emotion. Additionally, the subordinate characters are equally well portrayed, neither overly dramatic as if having their moment to shine, nor stiffly as if removed from the reality of the events.

The editing of the film is near perfect, with meaningful scene transitions and camera angles. One particular scene that showed a real historical awareness on the part of the costume designers and the direction was the quick cut to the hem of Christs garment in the scene portraying the conversation between the Samaritan woman and Jesus. Historically there was a difference of opinion and practice between the Samaritans and the Jews, and the writers of the film capitalized on their knowledge of that seemingly small detail to bring a true sense of reality to the reaction of the Samaritan woman to Jesus simple request for water.

If you want an enjoyable and truly superb film on the life of Christ, buy this film.",1414627200,8,1857,4.885714285714286

This is a masterful portrayal of the life and teachings of Christ according to the Gospel of John.",1405987200,,295,4.745098039215686
4111730,5,B003D90ZVE,"I have recommended this to SO MANY of my friends.  By-and-large, this movie is very accurate to the actual words of the Gospel of John, without adding any (well....maybe a tiny little) hollywood effects to the theme, words, or storyline.

The actors, and the scenes were very believable.  The flow from scene to scene was smooth, and by the end of the movie, you are left with a very positive, and peaceful image of a wonderful, loving God who would not spare his ONLY son in order to save anyone that believes & trusts in Him.

I've watched this move probably about 4 times now.

I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in getting the story in movie-form, as close as possible to the original narrative in the Gospel of John.",1395705600,3,736,4.503759398496241

I don't see Hollywood in it. I have many movies of The Bible , but this one stands out because of that.
Each time I view it I grasp something else. The Book Of John is different than the other gospels and perhaps the most memorized.",1391990400,,304,4.169491525423729

4111739,5,B003D90ZVE,"This video has much going for it. It was a major production. The quality and detail are very good. A lot of research went into the accuracy of producing it. There are both 2 hour and 3 hour dvd productions. I recommend the product that contains BOTH dvds. Henry Ian Cusick (from the tv series LOST) did a good job presenting what Jesus may have ""acted"" like as He continued to live out His prophetic message to a world never ready for it. I loved the bold, face to face attempts He made to enlighten the leadership of the Jerusalem Temple. Cusick portrays the love that Jesus displayed towards those who hated Him for what He was doing to their concept of the ancient Jewish faith. Of the few film accounts of John's Gospel I believe this to be the best theatrical production and the MOST complete and accurate as such.  If you believe the Bible to be a true record, and are a visual person, you will greatly value the insight that a highly detailed, visual persentaion offers.",1362441600,25,977,4.4581005586592175
4111740,5,B003D90ZVE,"Excellent presentation of the last years of the life of Christ.  The dialogue comes right from the New Testament, nothing or very little else is added.  It is long, three hours, and may be best seen in several settings.  It is powerful because you see Jesus struggling with people who don't understand or won't accept his message.  It will give viewers a new perspective on Jesus and the difficulties his followers had in understanding who he was and what his message was.  Well worth seeing.

4111742,5,B003D90ZVE,"Great film! It brings to life the words I've read so many times. Cusick portrays Jesus better than any actor I've seen in other movies of Christ's life. He actually smiles and brings levity where it's needed, and severity where it's needed. Good balance, good movie. I'm pretty sure the budget wasn't huge but it was well done with what they had",1351814400,2,345,4.580645161290323
4111743,4,B003D90ZVE,"This is a verbatim of The Good News Bible Version. The role of Jesus is surprisingly well portrayed by Henry Ian Cusick in spite of seeming almost too ""pretty"" for the part at first. He is the most convincing Jesus in any of the full gospel movies. Most actors portray Jesus in a way that is somewhat comatose and serene. Jesus was often neither of those, and Cusick brings to life the conflicts He faced daily as well as His passion for the Father. Most of the disciples  were very well done, especially Peter, but I was a bit disappointed in John. James and John were known as the ""Sons of Thunder"", but you would never know that by this pale version of John. There were a number of faux pas in the settings, attire and a few other odds and ends, but they become easily overlooked as you are drawn into the story. In this case, the story is what really matters, right? Still, it would be nice to have seen Cusick and [most of]the same disciples in a well done period piece with some great special effects for once. Sigh... But I do recommend owning this, because, while all misgivings fade in the distance, The gospel is eternal, and you'll have one book in the bible having come to life that you can draw upon time and again, which is always a good thing!",1344816000,14,1258,4.330508474576271
