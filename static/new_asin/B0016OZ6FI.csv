8263838,5,B0016OZ6FI,Great for a kid's class at church. That's what I bought it for. Stays true to the Bible,1458604800,,87,3.888888888888889
8263839,4,B0016OZ6FI,But I deducted 1 star for lacking the accuracy the HB version had. Haman didn't even have a Haman hat (hamantash).,1396224000,,114,4.476190476190476
8263840,5,B0016OZ6FI,I showed this to our Children's Sunday School Classes.  The children learned a great deal about Queen Esther that they did not know before.  I would recommend this highly as a teaching aide.,1374278400,,190,4.7272727272727275
