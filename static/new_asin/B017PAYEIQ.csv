7512513,3,B017PAYEIQ,"It was alright to watch once and very different, but also was one I enjoyed. I wouldn't say it is a very Christmas movie though, although it is leading up to Christmas eve. Not like Bishops wife, Its a wonderful life, the Bells of St Marys, Holiday Inn (of which are all on my favorites list for Christmas movies). The old lady is very unusual and her character unique - the one thing I did enjoy about the movie was her character.",1319587200,,431,4.2682926829268295
7512514,4,B017PAYEIQ,"Aunt Matilda Reed (Ann Harding) is a strange, rich old lady living in a New York mansion; her nephew Phillip (Reginald Denny)  want to get hold of her dough, but is she strange enough that he can get a court order giving him power over the estate? Not if she can get her 3 adopted sons back by Christmas time to stop him....

This basic idea was probably old even by 1947 and there have certainly been many variations on the theme done since, but probably few of them are made up of more disparate elements. George Brent is the first of the sons we meet, a ne'er-do-well playboy intent on dumping vivacious but poor Joan Blondell for a dull but wealthy new playmate -- his segment is essentially screwball comedy; next up is George Raft in a really intense, noir-spy story involving ex-Nazis in South America and quite a bit of gun violence and fisticuffs -- not what you'd expect in a typical Christmas story! Finally Randolph Scott comes along with his cowboy swagger to New York to get involved in a baby adoption ring and pick up a fair maiden (Virginia Field) who's trying to bust it, and they all meet up (with 3 new adoptees-to-be) at Aunt Mathilda's, apparently just in time.

There's nothing exciting about the plodding direction here by Edwin L. Marin, except perhaps for a few minutes in the Raft segment, and the stories are fairly preposterous and seem lifted right out of other movies, but the cast is charming enough and I had fun wasting an hour and a half -- I guess that's enough for a Hollywood Christmas movie sometimes.  Certainly this is more memorable than plenty of more recent efforts in the holiday genre, and it well deserves an official DVD release.  Between fans of Scott, Raft and Blondell there ought to be enough people out there to make such a thing doable - c'mon UA or whoever owns the rights!",1258156800,14,1828,4.527272727272727

8739988,5,B017PAYEIQ,"Always loved this movie from the first time I saw it on American Movie Classics in the 90's. Yes it is a bit corny by today's standards in films, but I enjoy it each and every time I watch it. It is a simple story of three men, who are not blood relatives but consider each other brothers. Their adopted mother played by Ann Harding has not seen each of 'her boys' in many years, but there are circumstances that occur leading  each of these men back home. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, so I will just say it is a sweet film and so happy it is available on DVD.",1468454400,5,579,3.948717948717949
8739989,3,B017PAYEIQ,"The film: What a cast -- George Raft, George Brent, Randolph Scott, Joan Blondell, Virginia Field, Dolores Moran. And they all acquit themselves admirably in this 30s niche film that haltingly moves forward towards the title's premise. An elderly matron hopes to resolve a pressing issue and vindication by uniting the diaspora of her three sons. Part drama, part noir, part screwball comedy. Somewhat difficult to say what genre this might be but it's pretty good and may bring a smile, chuckle, and laugh along the way.

Image quality: Well. I had hoped for better. I'm spoiled by the lustrous restorations of film like the same year's ""Out of the Past"" which has jaw dropping IQ. Here, the image never reaches those heights. Instead the film looks, overall, soft, muted, lacking in texture and detail -- mostly chalk and soot. Occasionally, in some of the Raft sequences, it looks as if something might happen for the better but that passes. I have no idea what the source material was but it wasn't great.

Audio quality: You've got to be kidding. It's low. How low? Real low. As in I had to dial up the volume level to 95/100 to hear the muted dialog. No subtitles. No closed captioning.

Extra features: Tiny chapter stops. Is that an extra? Other than that -- nothing, zip, nada.

I'm not privy to any inside information but I'm guessing Olive Films spared *no* expense in the restoration of this movie. Literally -- none. From the cover graphics which makes it look like a cheesy noir to the low audio level and lack of subtitles -- this feels like a slap in the face from Olive Films. If you want great image quality and great audio -- it ain't here.

So. Why do I rate it so highly? Well, I'm a Randolph Scott fan and that's why I bought this Blu-ray. This is not a great Scott film but it's ok, in the bottom tier. Scott always acquits himself in a role though the material may be lacking.

The film is enjoyable -- in a mashup of drama, noir, comedy, sentimental kind of way. It's a muted film, not great but ok. It's an odd sort of film but likable despite its faults.",1456012800,6,2081,4.506631299734748
8739990,1,B017PAYEIQ,"What a waste o' time!  And why did they put this paltry effort on Blu-ray?  Scott can't act his way out of a wet paper bag, Raft is flat-faced and ultra-contained.  Ye olde Mama looks like she put her face in the flour barrel.  I love classic movies, but not this one.",1454112000,,268,4.096153846153846
8739991,5,B017PAYEIQ,"Christmas Eve is a forgotten gem from RKO in 1947!  It has the charm of that great and now almost forgotten actress, Ann Harding, as an eccentric old lady who had adopted three sons who come home to save her from the clutches of a crooked lawyer wanting to take her home and money and shove her off to a rest home.  One of the sons is a playboy (George Brent), one is a gangster (George Raft), and the other is a rancher (Randolph Scott).  The lawyer tries to prove that the old lady is crazy because she has her sons' electric train on the dining table to move the condiments.  Her sons come from hither and yon at the last minute to save the day on Christmas Eve.  Joan Blondell is always a bonus to any movie and adds beauty, brains, and wisecracks to this holiday mix.",1418688000,3,772,4.1891891891891895
