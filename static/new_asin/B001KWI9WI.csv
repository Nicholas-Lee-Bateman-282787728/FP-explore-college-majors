I know that it isn't for everyone (the guy who reviewed it before me surprised me) but I don't like softcore porn cheesy vamp flicks.  I like Jack Turner!

But be warned, IT IS A SHORT FILM!  It's only 19 minutes and it's production values are decent, not great, not terrible, just decent.  But it's worth the cash, at least I think so.",1242259200,3,472,4.010752688172043
8702350,1,B001KWI9WI,"I'm sorry to say for those vampire fans amongst you, that we have yet another poor effort in Jack Turner and the Reluctant Vampire

There seems to be a spate of films recently that have emerged on Amazon for sale when they could have been put onto youtube and just about made the grade of 2 stars. The other example is 'The Union' which I also foolishly bought

From the cover it looks like we are going to get an epic standoff between a detective and some hot looking vampire

However, we find that there are no vampire scenes in the film at all - the female vamp doesn't even show her fangs! The first scene involves the female vamp 'attacking' her roommate and basically we do not see any biting and her roommate doesn't even turn which kind of disappoints on all levels (she might as well have been stabbed rather than bitten)

I spent twenty quid for this item and waited over a month for it to arrive. I then had to pay an import tax on it, totalling 50 quid. It was a huge mistake - and I usually love vampire films long or short

Stay away from this at all costs",1241136000,,1070,4.2
