8185965,5,B000BNMX38,"This is the second DVD set I've bought on the history of motion pictures and once again I was not disappointed. This time around you get to learn about how Edison first created the first motion picture projectors and then how he figured out how to make the original movies. Interestingly, the first films did not really have any plot and just look like moving photographs. Then, Edison got the idea that the movies could be used to tell stories, so he spent time figuring out how to use cuts and fades to explain to people what he was trying to get across. This is how the orignal real movies were made and we get to see the first efforts that would eventually lead to modern Die Hard Films.",1152835200,2,691,4.364341085271318
