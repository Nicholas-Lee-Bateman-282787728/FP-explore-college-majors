8536195,5,B0095MVXQE,"Around a year ago, I moved from a point and shoot to a Canon T2i. Quite by accident, doing a google search, I found and bought Michael's ""Canon Rebel T2i Crash Course Made for Beginners."" Michael taught me how to use the camera, and within several weeks I was shooting in manual mode exclusively.  At our town's Memorial Day parade, people were coming up to me and asking me questions about how to use their cameras that they had had for years.  Thanks to Michael's lessons and his easy going, friendly teaching style, I quickly ""got it."" I was able to answer basic operation questions on Memorial Day that were asked of me by people who had owned their cameras literally for years. Michael saved me years of frustration. Knowing the way I am, I probably would have given up on digital photography within months of having bought the camera. He kept me from making mistakes I surely would have made, and taught me how to do it right from the start. His teaching style so impressed me - he is the best teacher I have ever had, and I went to a very good college and a very good law school - I bought his lesson on ""advanced photography techniques."" It took me about a week or so to go through the course, but it will take me a lifetime to master all that he teaches. You cannot possibly learn the things on your own in years that Michael teaches in weeks. The only word of caution I have is that Michael Andrew will open up your eyes to see things that you used to take for granted - the beauty of the light in the golden hours when the sun rises and sets, the wonder of life itself, the awesome majesty of the earth and the heavens - and it can get expensive in a hurry with all the gear and lenses and software programs out there (Amazon is the best place to buy, no hassles, no games, no problems).  But you likely will love every moment of it. And in teaching about photography, he also teaches us things about how to be more patient, more observant, and more caring.  I came home tonight from a day in court, and I went straight for my camera bag.  Great way to unwind.  I took about two dozen pictures of my wife and dogs and self-portraits during and after dinner. Michael taught me how to do this.  Please trust me, I do not know and have never met Michael, and I have no pecuniary interest in this at all, but if you want to learn about digital photography, you need to buy this and Michael's other DVDs.  Thanks, and happy shooting.",1362096000,8,2439,4.275488069414317
8536196,5,B0095MVXQE,"I have several of Michael ""The Maven"" Andrews photo DVDs.  They are all great including this one. Michael enjoys teaching as much as he does photography.  I consider myself an intermediate photographer - but I learned more in a few hours with Michael's DVDs than I have from years of experimentation.",1361923200,6,300,4.862745098039215
