8687403,5,B00PCMXOFE,"I have gotten more out of these DVD's than any I have ever purchased. I was determined to see some gains in my arm definition and strength. I followed these as closely and as accurately as possible. What I like about this series is that..1. You have the option to start at a very basic beginning level. I did this for two weeks before moving to the second intermediate level. I did the intermediate level for three weeks and I am now into my third week at the advanced level. 2. The three models do the exercises with you in REAL time. I can start my workout as if I have three friends going to the gym with me. I enjoy it and actually look forward to my work outs. Each level has a warm up, main work out and cool down section. Between each exercise there is a clock and a one minute break before the next exercise begins... No more having to watch a clock or wonder how long you should rest. Just stop when they do and begin when the minute is up. I love this! 3. I like the music in the background. I have heard some awful and distracting music on workout DVD's. This music has a nice rhythm is not distracting. 4. The workouts are challenging but not discouraging. I have tried some fitness DVD's that it was not possible for me to keep up and complete. These workouts are ones that you can do and enjoy. They also produce results. I am very happy with this purchase and plan to buy others from Jon Spurling. They don't tell you what you will need for all of the workouts. By the time you finish the advanced you will need Free weights, Resistance bands, medicine ball, and two tennis balls. They also do not tell you how much time to spend in each level or how many days to do the exercises. I just used my own discretion and decided the time that felt right for me.",1434499200,,1771,4.181286549707602

8687405,1,B00PCMXOFE,"I Have purchased beach body (beast body) which i was very happy with and I wanted 2 find something different just to change things up, so I purchased  (build big arms),  was about to purchase all three DVD's, arms, V-shape back, legs etc but wanted to try one of DVD first. Glad I did. I would not recommend any Of the dvd. Try the advanced and was very disappointed. Just my honest opinion.",1422921600,,391,4.342465753424658
8687406,5,B00PCMXOFE,"Not everyone has enough time, money or willingness to spend it in a gym. As I have nice experience working out while watching some other exercise instructional video/s, I've recommended this video set to my friend, who usually works mostly on his abs and legs, supposing if he had some handy video for arms, he might work more on them as well. He likes this set, especially because it is suitable for the beginners, as well as for more advanced workout.",1420416000,,453,4.604938271604938
8687407,5,B00PCMXOFE,"Who doesn't want bigger arms and cut biceps? This DVD workout gives your arms some definition and a nice pump. I like that Jon gives people the option if they aren't fit enough yet, to start a little slower. Working your way up gives you good progress to track and motivates you to keep getting bigger.",1415664000,,302,4.410714285714286
