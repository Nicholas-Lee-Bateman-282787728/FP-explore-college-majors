3167203,5,B00172TIOE,"The DVD begins with an excellent lecture by Master Yang on basic concepts of martial arts applications in Taijiquan. As Master Yang points out, you can practice Taijiquan for health-purposes only and do this with very little instruction from a teacher.

However, to learn the martial side of Taijiquan requires a teacher along with hands-on practice of the applications, preferably with a variety of persons of various sizes, strengths and skills. The lecture covers familiar material as well as new concepts. The lecture is over thirty minutes long and every minute is enjoyable and informative.

Master Yang's style of Taijiquan originates with Yang Pan-hou, the second child of Yang, Lu Chan, the originator of Yang Style Taijiquan. Yang Pan-hou was second in skill only to his father, Yang, Lu Chan. Yang Pan-hou was known for teaching a very martial arts oriented version of the Yang style.

One of the aspects of this DVD that I love is the teaching of how to utilize coiling techniques in the applications. Usually, and I find this inaccurate, people say that Yang style does not use coiling. As Master Yang so capably demonstrates, coiling is an integral part of applying the techniques found in Chen Style as well as Yang Style Taijiquan. Even the Yin Yang diagram shows the pattern of coiling within the design.

Master Yang points out that as one develops a sense of enemy, Qi is more easily led in the body. What I've always found to be interesting is that some practitioners state their reluctance to learn any of the martial aspects of Taijiquan, as their interest is only for the health benefits. The irony being that if they learned the martial side of Taijiquan, then the benefits of health would increase. The movements become more balanced, integrated, powerful and effective when done with a sense of purpose (martial intent), as is displayed when one practices the movements with knowledge of the martial applications.

There are 37 unique postures (patterns) in the long set of Yang Style Taijiquan. The long form of Yang Taijiquan, whether counted as 88 or 108 movements, has many repeats of some of the 37 unique postures. Ward off, rollback, press and push are repeated seven times throughout the form. These four movements are the heart of the Yang Style of Taijiquan. They represent the cardinal directions and four of the movements from the original 13 movements of Taijiquan. Consequently Master Yang gives these four movements their due when demonstrating applications found within the four movements.

Many of the techniques found within the 37 postures have been covered in previous DVDs by Master Yang. Without viewing the DVD it might be assumed that this would be material already available on other DVDs. However, Master Yang, demonstrating a clear understanding of the techniques that are the foundation of the applications, is able to present new ways of employing the techniques found within the 37 postures of Taijiquan.

While watching the DVD I felt two seemingly opposite feelings; the feeling of recognition as he described various applications, as well as the feeling of learning new knowledge as Master Yang presented another view of how to use the postures of Taijiquan in a martial way. Remember, there are few techniques, and many applications that are manifested from the understanding and use of these techniques.

One of the points stressed throughout the DVD is the importance of the legs in the application of techniques. The legs are the foundation, the root and the origin of power in Taijiquan. In the classes I teach one of the things I stress is if you have trouble following the form, then just follow the leg movements. Without the foundation, the rest (upper body movement) is ineffective.

Bottom line, the DVD is excellent. Along with the many applications demonstrated throughout the DVD by Master Yang and his students, Master Yang and his daughter Kathy also demonstrate the Yang Style Taijiquan form. Master Yang and Kathy Yang look great together as they show the form.

This is a must-have DVD for the serious Taijiquan practitioner.",1210636800,55,4103,5.020588235294118
3167204,5,B00172TIOE,"How could something so stunning as Taiji become so ""stunning"" as Taiji Chuan? Even this tidy and stunted little DVD practice?

I talked to somebody in 'the know', and, out of all of the 'Internal fighting martial arts' the Yang (not the man) style (he didn't say which brand) was by far the most brutal.  I couldn't believe my ears. A whole generation of grannies, potentially, charging their chi's in readiness for who knows what?

I was transfixed when it came to the DVD. And stunned! Dr Yang pulls no punches.  The whole package is very nearly deeply tremendous.

The '37' is quite a work of (martial applications) art. Well worth a purchase.  Go buy and you'll see what I mean and practice what Dr. Yang preaches, and it's not mumbo-jumbo rubbish). It's well worth your time instead. Very well worth it, indeed.",1455408000,3,816,4.671328671328672

3167208,4,B00172TIOE,"A very good tutorial dvd on applications.

The movements of Yang Tai Chi Chuan are well broken down, with attention to the internal arts principles required for solo practice (including the ""why we do it this way"" points) , and then application is examined. The approach to application is with an eye to what targets in striking and strategies in grappling are offered by the technique, and in a manner which seemed to me to be inviting testing and improvisation in practice. When demonstrating one of the forms, for example, variations were addressed in positioning, legwork options, and targets for striking. While any martial technique will have its ""best possible scenario"" methods, the potential for variation was not totally discarded. The techniques offered are presented to the practitioner as much as concepts which they can build upon in their training, not see as hard and fast ""this is the way we do it"" moves. As Dr. Yang says in the intro, if you are doing your Tai Chi Chuan exactly the same way after years of practice as the first day, haven't you been wasting your time? There is a lot offered here to play around with.

Much else I could say, but others have already said it. I think many people who already know some Tai Chi Chuan will find this dvd helpful.
It gives more meaning and substance to practicing the art beyond being a mere ""moving yoga"" exercise.
(I WOULD like to see Dr. Yang do another dvd entirely on free-fighting, and how to incorporate these techniques into your sparring.)

Still, IMHO, a fine addition to anyone's martial library.",1428192000,,1572,4.772058823529412

I went to a Tai Chi teacher several years ago & was very disappointed with the results. Now I'm considering taking up the practice again.,1388448000,,291,4.509433962264151

3167221,5,B00172TIOE,"Preserving the essence of taijiquan is a monumentally important task, and we are fortunate to have an exceptional teacher in Dr. Yang. His riveting lecture and superb demonstration reveal the immense depth and breadth of taijiquan. With that being said, Dr. Yang also states that the true origin and application of taijiquan is vanishing. Perhaps ten percent of practitioners integrate taijiquan's root -- defense -- into their practice.

Any person practicing Tai Chi should listen to Dr. Yang's lecture. In my opinion, many would be stunned by a concept heretofore never exposed to them: taijiquan is an internal martial art. While it is true that one can practice simply for relaxation and health, Dr. Yang points out that if your understanding is shallow Tai Chi is not as effective.

Taijiquan ultimately means ""fist of the mind"". Mind leads the Chi, wherein you harness, project and focus martial power (Jin) to specific body points with precise recoiling velocity (whipping). Your power manifests from relaxation, lower oxygen consumption, and EMF -- the electro motive force of nerves. This increases your ability to stick with your opponent. Contrast that with the blunt force emitted by muscular tension, which consumes more oxygen, releases acid to the muscles, and results in early fatigue. Every taijiquan movement, therefore, is a strategy: it has a name, a meaning, and an application. Here you will find the root of taijiquan.

For example, a movement called ""Single Whip"" (Dan Bian) has several phases of martial application: You transition from ""An"" (settle the wrists) with Yin coiling; move the body from east to north to west; the whip is again north-facing; you complete the movement with your body facing north and your left arm and head facing west.

What does it all mean?

Why do we coil with the right hand to initiate the movement?

Why do we use Peng (round the chest, arc the back) as we face north?

Why do we then flip our hands and arms?

What is the whipping motion for?

I would submit that it's not a nicely choreographed dance, and the serious student should ask questions about EVERY movement. What you learn is the difference in reciting what you are told to think, or thinking for yourself and saying what YOU believe. Moreover, it gives body to Dr. Yang's precept: ""Have a sense of enemy when doing the form"" (Di Yi).

For those who want a deeper understanding of taijiquan and greater dimension within their practice, this is an excellent companion to Dr. Yang's later DVD, Yang Tai Chi For Beginners.",1373673600,13,2543,4.934426229508197

3167223,5,B00172TIOE,"This DVD is one of the best for Tai-Chi practitioners who want more out of Tai-Chi. Dr Yang Jwing-Ming does it again, truly a Tai-Chi living legend. He starts out with class like lessons explaining the theory of Tai-Chi. This is fairly long and informative, but you can skip this and come back to it later if you choose and just go straight into the applications. They are also easy to locate in the menu. The applications are straight forward and effective, but some do require watching over a few times to sink in. He goes pretty in depth for each posture to make sure you get it. But in so saying that, he stresses heavily about the concepts of Tai-Chi if you wish to learn the applications. Once you understand the concepts, like breaking your opponents balance and how best to apply your arms and legs in their strongest positions, you can literally defeat your opponent using minimal force. I always go back to this DVD when I feel dry in my training as I am interested in Tai-Chi more for it's martial aspects rather than it's art. This is a must have! This DVD is worth every cent and will not disappoint. You should also check out Glen Hairston's DVDs as well for more practical martial applications.",1363564800,2,1209,4.525114155251141

2.  The presenter demonstrating a modified version of a Yang short form
3.  The presenter breaking down the 37 positions of the Yang short form and demonstrating applications with another with an eye towards conveying effective applications.

It may take some time to soak in what Dr. Yang is teaching here and that makes this presentation valuable.  Dr. yang takes the time to convey the purpose of each of the movements and does a
good job of demonstrating the blocks, joint locks and the fundamental concepts that provide the purpose for the motion. Dr. Yang makes the effort to direct the viewers attention to the part of the form that is most critical and then explains why a particular action has a consequence.  Dr. Yang is a skilled teacher and has the mind of a student in his presentation.  Pick up the book as well and between the two you will have an excellent study set.

3167229,4,B00172TIOE,"Dr. Yang brings to us a video giving heavily (but not inappropriately so) academic treatment of Tai Chi as it was first intended: a martial art. He gives a defense of his teachings versus other styles within Tai Chi, a full explanation of why Tai Chi works the way it does, and how you can benefit from learning Tai Chi the way he teaches it.

As implied by the product description, and the several reviews here, Dr. Yang gives a thorough walk-through of the martial applications he has found in a single (long) kata.

Students of the martial arts can take this as two DVD resources in one: first, the historical and theory-rich first half, and second, the latter half depicting well over two dozen martial applications, a number of which should be familiar to the long-term martial artist of any style. Even someone who doesn't study Tai Chi could easily find a number of ways to get the wheels spinning and explore new ways of doing things.

Dr. Yang appears very comfortable in front of a camera, has an obvious command of the material, and does an admirable job of presenting it.

This is probably the best martial arts DVD that I have watched.

It opens with a good lecture on the basics of taiji martial arts applications.
Next comes a beautiful, shortened 5 minute demo of the classic Yang style taiji form.

The bulk of the dvd, and the very best part, are demonstrations of the applications that are hidden away inside the long form. Since I have been practicing 24 form Yang style for many years, I was aware of some of the applications, but I was really surprized and educated by the many take-down and chin na applications in the form as well as the strikes and partially hidden kicks. These applications are really there and I was totally unaware that they existed.

The applications are followed by a demo of the first part of the Yang long form that is performed by Yang Zwing-Ming and his daughter Kathy.

After watching the applications in this DVD, my daily practice has become much deeper and more mindfull.
This is an absolute must watch dvd if you are doing taiji chuan.

With that movement you can correctly execute the form. It becomes a part of you not just something you do to warm up.

Dr. Yang gives you some history and knowledge of taiji and what it is for.  We are fortunate enough to have an interpreter of ancient Chinese secrets, no pun intended.

If you have learned the Yang form and would like to improve your execution and understanding then add this video and the companion book, if you can, to your library.

3167234,5,B00172TIOE,"I have enjoyed viewing and studying this video presentation of the Yang form. I like the way Dr Yang presents the material as it follows the structure I typically use to present and teach Yang form to my students. It is how my Sifu taught me. One of the very important points Dr Yang makes is that, without understanding the martial application of the form it is very difficult to derive the full benefit of practicing taiji. I whole heartedly agree with him on this point.

Dr. Yang does an excellent job and is very thorough in his explanation and demonstration of his form as he has come to understand and know its meaning and application over 40 years of practice. It is interesting to see where his emphasis is placed in a certain posture or pattern and to hear his explanation of how and why this is done in this way, as well as how it affects the energy of the form and the opponent.

If you are an experienced taiji practitioner I think you'll find this video to be highly informative and it may give you some new concepts to think about and play with in your own practice. If you are just beginning your taiji practice it may help you understand what you are learning as well as give you a larger picture of taiji. I think you will find his lecture on the tape very helpful with many core concepts you will need to ingrain in order to find your taiji.

Again, highly recommended for taiji practitioners at any level of skill, and it will make an excellent addition to your martial arts library.

3167235,5,B00172TIOE,"I was absolutely amazed at how much I gained from this DVD.  Both on a conceptual level and at the point of application, Dr. Yang will open and expand not only your Tai Chi, but your entire martial arts experience.

The opening sequence is a classroom lecture bridging ""Taiji"" and the concept of ""quan"" (Combined these two form the word ""Taijiquan""). In this discussion Dr. Yang makes his point and the viewer will make the mental connection of Taiji, not only as a practice for health and relaxation, but Taiji as a martial application.

Don't skip this lecture... watch it twice!

In the following chapters he ties your current Tai Chi practice with this concept and the actual martial application.  All is done in a straightforward and uncomplicated manner, as Dr. Yang teaches you to make your own decisions based on sound fundamental knowledge, not on memorizing specific moves.

3167236,5,B00172TIOE,"This DVD is what I have been looking for since I began learning Tai Chi.  I study and teach a martial art called Kenpo and through that practice I was aware that Tai Chi had Martial applications.  I began my Tai Chi study about 10 years ago and the lessons I had emphasized the health and meditation benefits.  Don't get me wrong I love Tai Chi for these benefits.  But, I always wondered about the martial applications.  Several Tai Chi instructors I have had who were aware of my Kenpo background  even asked me if I could see the defense/offense movements in the forms. Although some of the applications were obvious...the subtle intricate movements were not as obvious.

So, getting this DVD was like manna from heaven.  Dr. Yang is amazing.  His knowledge is deep and his method of instruction is easy to follow.  It honestly felt like he was in the room with me providing personal instruction. He explains how to apply the defensive and offensive movements of TaiJi in depth.  He even discusses not just one but several applications for each move dependent on the way an opponent attacks.  This DVD has greatly improved my practice by adding information on ""coiling"", proper leg placement,intricate hand movements and many other important techniques of TaiJi.  I very highly recommend this DVD to Tai Chi practitioners or to those just wanting to learn Tai Chi for defense.",1258934400,3,1379,4.7923728813559325

He explains how the basic concept of Taiji is a defensive movement and how it easily converts over to a fighting art. Master Yang shows basic movements along with his students and then later teaches the martial art forms.

I especially enjoyed his theory of how Taiji turns the mind into power and then into action. He teaches the history of Taiji and how it developed over the years into different forms. He explains the fundementals of the art of Taiji and with the aid of his students demonstrates the basic movements. The movements are easy to follow and I especially valued the explanation of positioning the body, hands and feet as part of the exercise. You can see the gracefullness of the Master as he performs the forms and it is easy to follow and copy. I can watch this DVD over and over and learn something new with each viewing.

It may be also be helpful to combine this DVD with Master Yang's book of the same title. His theories, history and application of Taiji make for an excellent education of the art form.

3167239,5,B00172TIOE,"Once again Dr. Yang presents us with an incredible compilation of  martial techniques from yet another of the Yang-style forms.  Yang, Ban-Hou's form that is presented here contains differences than the more common forms passed down by his brother Yang, Cheng-Fu.  Dr. Yang presents a interesting look at the differences and offers his own understandings based on personal study of 49 treatises of Yang Tai Chi Chuan written by Yang, Ban-How.

While this DVD presents the rare 37-posture form passed down by Yang, Ban-Hou, the video showcases over 75 possible applications of standard Yang tai chi postures, all of which can be found in other Yang forms. Dr. Yang also demonstrates application relationships to pushing hands and tai chi chin na concepts that appear in several of his other publications.  Since Dr. Yang clearly wishes to further strengthen the student's understanding of the complexities and relationships of tai chi movement, posture, breathing, jing, and coiling, this video presents detail that is sometimes beyond the reach and understanding of beginning tai chi students or those wishing to practice tai chi only for health.  For this reason, I would not recommend this DVD for those looking to begin tai chi study, but for the experienced practitioners.  For those who are experienced, this video is an invaluable treasure chest full of enlightening analysis and martial applications.",1257897600,2,1407,5.2825112107623315

3167241,5,B00172TIOE,"This DVD is informative to all styles of Tai Chi.
My review won't be as long as the other reviews, but I wanted to say that this is very well produced DVD.  This DVD is awesome.

Dr Yang has picked 37 Tai Chi postures that he believes to be representative of all the forms in Tai Chi and demonstrates them on students, explains the application, and then has the students do the forms.  The students are not fully accomplished experts yet and so they make mistakes while trying the posture applications.  These mistakes are representative of common mistakes and Dr Yang corrects the mistakes while explaining why they would make the mistake and why they should do it the correct way.

The photography and DVD menu selection are also very good.
You do not have to know the Tai Chi form to benefit from this DVD, although being familiar with the postures will be helpful.
Also viewing this will be helpful with your form practice as you will have a better understanding of how the form works; and how and why you should position your body.

Also, I thought this was much easier to understand than the book of similar title.  But after watching this DVD I went back to the book and it made more sense to me.  Seeing the applications in motion on a DVD is really helpful.

I recommend this for anybody that wants to do Tai Chi beyond just copying their teacher.",1251676800,15,1356,4.479674796747967
3167242,5,B00172TIOE,"I heartily recommend this DVD for anyone in the beginner to high intermediate levels of learning taiji. In particular, it's best for those who are not rank beginners, who know a short form and are looking for more. This presentation:
* Offers a lecture-overview of the practical fundamentals of taiji
* Shows Dr. Yang doing a modified version of his Yang short form
* Shows Dr. Yang discussing each one of the 37 positions of the Yang short form and demonstrating its martial applications with a partner.

You will not get everything out of this DVD after one or even a handful of viewings. Rather, I got the sense that it is a DVD to return to often in different stages of your training because there are important concepts here that you will only be ready for as your knowledge and form progress.

I was getting back into taiji after a ten-year hiatus and a friend suggested I take a look at this DVD. Not only was it the perfect refresher that helped me fit right in to a level 2 taiji class at my gym, but as a former aikidoka I was pleasantly surprised to see martial applications that took me back to my aikido days; blocks, throws, joint locks and more lay behind the flowing motions. I had never guessed they were there because my former teachers had never talked about the martial applications... Now, I'm not at the level that I can use any of these applications yet, but just knowing that they're present reminds me to focus on my form and posture to avoid picking up bad habits in my training.

As I hinted before, there's a lot packed into the lectures and demonstrations that will help practitioners of different skill levels.

For beginners, the initial lecture is great because it gives you a sense that taiji really isn't just about waving your arms slowly as you move around; rather there is a discrete body of techniques that describe the foundation of the art. Too, the discussion of the adaptation of the style by various Yang family patriarchs teaches that the patterns you learn from your teachers are, first of all, not set in stone and, second, adaptable for practitioners of all sizes and shapes. The demonstrations are great--but don't worry about trying to figure out the martial applications now. Instead, Dr. Yang will draw attention to the part of the form where the actual ""work"" occurs. That is, he tells you exactly which movements are the most essential to execute correctly.

More intermediate practitioners who are more experienced will get more out of the applications. Furthermore, Dr. Yang notes which ones are particularly common and effective in push-hands.

The single most important thing that Dr. Yang tries to teach in this DVD, however, is not just technique or even specific applications themselves. His overarching purpose is to teach advanced students how to ""read"" a form, how to take a short or long form and to analyze it, visualize it, and understand the logic and theory that lie behind it.

Me--I'm nowhere near that level now and it will probably be years before I get there. However, there are a host of skills, techniques and tidbits packed into this presentation that I will be enjoying as I slowly work towards that point.

In summary, then, some quick pros and cons:
Pros:
* The DVD grows with you. Watch it once and you'll realize you need to watch it again (and again) to learn more.
* I love that you can jump to any of the 37 positions/applications. I'm learning the Beijing short form which is different from the classical Yang but this way I jump quickly to the position I'm looking for.
* It reinforces that taiji really is a martial art, not just a slow-moving exercise and thus form and execution matter!

Cons:
* The only regret I have about the DVD is that I didn't get the accompanying book too. In the lecture, Dr. Yang mentions some things (13 postures?) that he doesn't explain; the way he alludes to them, however, suggests that they are laid out in full in the book.

Overall, a great DVD!!",1226275200,24,3969,4.641025641025641
3167243,4,B00172TIOE,"Dr. Yang's knowledge is excellent.  The practice of Taiji (or Tai Chi) is known primarily for its health benefits.  In this DVD, the martial aspects of this art is made clearer.",1221696000,2,177,4.67741935483871
3401700,5,B00172TIOE,"The DVD begins with an excellent lecture by Master Yang on basic concepts of martial arts applications in Taijiquan. As Master Yang points out, you can practice Taijiquan for health-purposes only and do this with very little instruction from a teacher.

However, to learn the martial side of Taijiquan requires a teacher along with hands-on practice of the applications, preferably with a variety of persons of various sizes, strengths and skills. The lecture covers familiar material as well as new concepts. The lecture is over thirty minutes long and every minute is enjoyable and informative.

Master Yang's style of Taijiquan originates with Yang Pan-hou, the second child of Yang, Lu Chan, the originator of Yang Style Taijiquan. Yang Pan-hou was second in skill only to his father, Yang, Lu Chan. Yang Pan-hou was known for teaching a very martial arts oriented version of the Yang style.

One of the aspects of this DVD that I love is the teaching of how to utilize coiling techniques in the applications. Usually, and I find this inaccurate, people say that Yang style does not use coiling. As Master Yang so capably demonstrates, coiling is an integral part of applying the techniques found in Chen Style as well as Yang Style Taijiquan. Even the Yin Yang diagram shows the pattern of coiling within the design.

Master Yang points out that as one develops a sense of enemy, Qi is more easily led in the body. What I've always found to be interesting is that some practitioners state their reluctance to learn any of the martial aspects of Taijiquan, as their interest is only for the health benefits. The irony being that if they learned the martial side of Taijiquan, then the benefits of health would increase. The movements become more balanced, integrated, powerful and effective when done with a sense of purpose (martial intent), as is displayed when one practices the movements with knowledge of the martial applications.

There are 37 unique postures (patterns) in the long set of Yang Style Taijiquan. The long form of Yang Taijiquan, whether counted as 88 or 108 movements, has many repeats of some of the 37 unique postures. Ward off, rollback, press and push are repeated seven times throughout the form. These four movements are the heart of the Yang Style of Taijiquan. They represent the cardinal directions and four of the movements from the original 13 movements of Taijiquan. Consequently Master Yang gives these four movements their due when demonstrating applications found within the four movements.

Many of the techniques found within the 37 postures have been covered in previous DVDs by Master Yang. Without viewing the DVD it might be assumed that this would be material already available on other DVDs. However, Master Yang, demonstrating a clear understanding of the techniques that are the foundation of the applications, is able to present new ways of employing the techniques found within the 37 postures of Taijiquan.

While watching the DVD I felt two seemingly opposite feelings; the feeling of recognition as he described various applications, as well as the feeling of learning new knowledge as Master Yang presented another view of how to use the postures of Taijiquan in a martial way. Remember, there are few techniques, and many applications that are manifested from the understanding and use of these techniques.

One of the points stressed throughout the DVD is the importance of the legs in the application of techniques. The legs are the foundation, the root and the origin of power in Taijiquan. In the classes I teach one of the things I stress is if you have trouble following the form, then just follow the leg movements. Without the foundation, the rest (upper body movement) is ineffective.

Bottom line, the DVD is excellent. Along with the many applications demonstrated throughout the DVD by Master Yang and his students, Master Yang and his daughter Kathy also demonstrate the Yang Style Taijiquan form. Master Yang and Kathy Yang look great together as they show the form.

This is a must-have DVD for the serious Taijiquan practitioner.",1210636800,55,4103,5.020588235294118
3401701,5,B00172TIOE,"How could something so stunning as Taiji become so ""stunning"" as Taiji Chuan? Even this tidy and stunted little DVD practice?

I talked to somebody in 'the know', and, out of all of the 'Internal fighting martial arts' the Yang (not the man) style (he didn't say which brand) was by far the most brutal.  I couldn't believe my ears. A whole generation of grannies, potentially, charging their chi's in readiness for who knows what?

I was transfixed when it came to the DVD. And stunned! Dr Yang pulls no punches.  The whole package is very nearly deeply tremendous.

The movements of Yang Tai Chi Chuan are well broken down, with attention to the internal arts principles required for solo practice (including the ""why we do it this way"" points) , and then application is examined. The approach to application is with an eye to what targets in striking and strategies in grappling are offered by the technique, and in a manner which seemed to me to be inviting testing and improvisation in practice. When demonstrating one of the forms, for example, variations were addressed in positioning, legwork options, and targets for striking. While any martial technique will have its ""best possible scenario"" methods, the potential for variation was not totally discarded. The techniques offered are presented to the practitioner as much as concepts which they can build upon in their training, not see as hard and fast ""this is the way we do it"" moves. As Dr. Yang says in the intro, if you are doing your Tai Chi Chuan exactly the same way after years of practice as the first day, haven't you been wasting your time? There is a lot offered here to play around with.

Much else I could say, but others have already said it. I think many people who already know some Tai Chi Chuan will find this dvd helpful.
It gives more meaning and substance to practicing the art beyond being a mere ""moving yoga"" exercise.
(I WOULD like to see Dr. Yang do another dvd entirely on free-fighting, and how to incorporate these techniques into your sparring.)

3401718,5,B00172TIOE,"Preserving the essence of taijiquan is a monumentally important task, and we are fortunate to have an exceptional teacher in Dr. Yang. His riveting lecture and superb demonstration reveal the immense depth and breadth of taijiquan. With that being said, Dr. Yang also states that the true origin and application of taijiquan is vanishing. Perhaps ten percent of practitioners integrate taijiquan's root -- defense -- into their practice.

Any person practicing Tai Chi should listen to Dr. Yang's lecture. In my opinion, many would be stunned by a concept heretofore never exposed to them: taijiquan is an internal martial art. While it is true that one can practice simply for relaxation and health, Dr. Yang points out that if your understanding is shallow Tai Chi is not as effective.

Taijiquan ultimately means ""fist of the mind"". Mind leads the Chi, wherein you harness, project and focus martial power (Jin) to specific body points with precise recoiling velocity (whipping). Your power manifests from relaxation, lower oxygen consumption, and EMF -- the electro motive force of nerves. This increases your ability to stick with your opponent. Contrast that with the blunt force emitted by muscular tension, which consumes more oxygen, releases acid to the muscles, and results in early fatigue. Every taijiquan movement, therefore, is a strategy: it has a name, a meaning, and an application. Here you will find the root of taijiquan.

For example, a movement called ""Single Whip"" (Dan Bian) has several phases of martial application: You transition from ""An"" (settle the wrists) with Yin coiling; move the body from east to north to west; the whip is again north-facing; you complete the movement with your body facing north and your left arm and head facing west.

What does it all mean?

Why do we coil with the right hand to initiate the movement?

Why do we use Peng (round the chest, arc the back) as we face north?

Why do we then flip our hands and arms?

What is the whipping motion for?

I would submit that it's not a nicely choreographed dance, and the serious student should ask questions about EVERY movement. What you learn is the difference in reciting what you are told to think, or thinking for yourself and saying what YOU believe. Moreover, it gives body to Dr. Yang's precept: ""Have a sense of enemy when doing the form"" (Di Yi).

For those who want a deeper understanding of taijiquan and greater dimension within their practice, this is an excellent companion to Dr. Yang's later DVD, Yang Tai Chi For Beginners.",1373673600,13,2543,4.934426229508197

This is fairly long and informative, but you can skip this and come back to it later if you choose and just go straight into the applications. They are also easy to locate in the menu. The applications are straight forward and effective, but some do require watching over a few times to sink in. He goes pretty in depth for each posture to make sure you get it. But in so saying that, he stresses heavily about the concepts of Tai-Chi if you wish to learn the applications. Once you understand the concepts, like breaking your opponents balance and how best to apply your arms and legs in their strongest positions, you can literally defeat your opponent using minimal force.

The bulk of the dvd, and the very best part, are demonstrations of the applications that are hidden away inside the long form.

These applications are really there and I was totally unaware that they existed.

The applications are followed by a demo of the first part of the Yang long form that is performed by Yang Zwing-Ming and his daughter Kathy.

3401729,5,B00172TIOE,"The master has done it again.  It is nice to know the form but for the martial artist that is not enough.  You need to learn the application of the movements of the form.  With that movement you can correctly execute the form. It becomes a part of you not just something you do to warm up.

Dr. Yang gives you some history and knowledge of taiji and what it is for.  We are fortunate enough to have an interpreter of ancient Chinese secrets, no pun intended.

If you have learned the Yang form and would like to improve your execution and understanding then add this video and the companion book, if you can, to your library.  Dr. Yang has done a great job of explaining not only the application of the forms but the meaning behind them.  Each time you play this dvd you will learn something.  This is not only a teaching dvd it is a learning dvd so take plenty of notes.",1265846400,3,871,4.2303030303030305
3401730,5,B00172TIOE,"If you, like me, want to understand the history and martial arts applications of the flowing moves behind Tai Chi, buy this DVD! The lecture alone about the practical aspects of Tai Chi was excellent. The form demonstrations are masterful, and the explanation of martial applications was a most welcome change of perspective. This DVD can be returned to over and over as your martial arts training progresses.",1265846400,,409,5.029411764705882
3401731,5,B00172TIOE,"I have enjoyed viewing and studying this video presentation of the Yang form. I like the way Dr Yang presents the material as it follows the structure I typically use to present and teach Yang form to my students. It is how my Sifu taught me. One of the very important points Dr Yang makes is that, without understanding the martial application of the form it is very difficult to derive the full benefit of practicing taiji. I whole heartedly agree with him on this point.

Dr. Yang does an excellent job and is very thorough in his explanation and demonstration of his form as he has come to understand and know its meaning and application over 40 years of practice. It is interesting to see where his emphasis is placed in a certain posture or pattern and to hear his explanation of how and why this is done in this way, as well as how it affects the energy of the form and the opponent.

If you are an experienced taiji practitioner I think you'll find this video to be highly informative and it may give you some new concepts to think about and play with in your own practice. If you are just beginning your taiji practice it may help you understand what you are learning as well as give you a larger picture of taiji. I think you will find his lecture on the tape very helpful with many core concepts you will need to ingrain in order to find your taiji.

Again, highly recommended for taiji practitioners at any level of skill, and it will make an excellent addition to your martial arts library.

3401732,5,B00172TIOE,"I was absolutely amazed at how much I gained from this DVD.  Both on a conceptual level and at the point of application, Dr. Yang will open and expand not only your Tai Chi, but your entire martial arts experience.

The opening sequence is a classroom lecture bridging ""Taiji"" and the concept of ""quan"" (Combined these two form the word ""Taijiquan""). In this discussion Dr. Yang makes his point and the viewer will make the mental connection of Taiji, not only as a practice for health and relaxation, but Taiji as a martial application.

Don't skip this lecture... watch it twice!

In the following chapters he ties your current Tai Chi practice with this concept and the actual martial application.  All is done in a straightforward and uncomplicated manner, as Dr. Yang teaches you to make your own decisions based on sound fundamental knowledge, not on memorizing specific moves.

I cannot fully express to you how effortlessly and completely these fundamentals are communicated or, how well postures and patterns are demonstrated.",1259366400,2,1035,5.023391812865497
3401733,5,B00172TIOE,"This DVD is what I have been looking for since I began learning Tai Chi.  I study and teach a martial art called Kenpo and through that practice I was aware that Tai Chi had Martial applications.  I began my Tai Chi study about 10 years ago and the lessons I had emphasized the health and meditation benefits.  Don't get me wrong I love Tai Chi for these benefits.  But, I always wondered about the martial applications.  Several Tai Chi instructors I have had who were aware of my Kenpo background  even asked me if I could see the defense/offense movements in the forms. Although some of the applications were obvious...the subtle intricate movements were not as obvious.

So, getting this DVD was like manna from heaven.  Dr. Yang is amazing.  His knowledge is deep and his method of instruction is easy to follow.  It honestly felt like he was in the room with me providing personal instruction. He explains how to apply the defensive and offensive movements of TaiJi in depth.  He even discusses not just one but several applications for each move dependent on the way an opponent attacks.  This DVD has greatly improved my practice by adding information on ""coiling"", proper leg placement,intricate hand movements and many other important techniques of TaiJi.  I very highly recommend this DVD to Tai Chi practitioners or to those just wanting to learn Tai Chi for defense.",1258934400,3,1379,4.7923728813559325
3401734,5,B00172TIOE,"I have practiced tai chi off and on for several years but never seriously because I was not able to find someone could actually authoritatively show the actual martial applications behind this 2,000 year old graceful dance.  It's a shame that in this country tai chi has been reduced to an exercise and relaxation program instead of being the rightful ancestor to all east Asian martial arts.  Imagine being in the Forbidden City with 500 Chinese soldiers for morning practice/drill for the Emperor.

This is a great video that explains and demonstrate the true origins of this powerful martial art...",1258761600,3,601,4.99
3401735,5,B00172TIOE,"Master Yang demonstrates how the art of Taiji can be applied over to a martial art technique. He explains how the basic concept of Taiji is a defensive movement and how it easily converts over to a fighting art. Master Yang shows basic movements along with his students and then later teaches the martial art forms.

I especially enjoyed his theory of how Taiji turns the mind into power and then into action. He teaches the history of Taiji and how it developed over the years into different forms. He explains the fundementals of the art of Taiji and with the aid of his students demonstrates the basic movements. The movements are easy to follow and I especially valued the explanation of positioning the body, hands and feet as part of the exercise. You can see the gracefullness of the Master as he performs the forms and it is easy to follow and copy. I can watch this DVD over and over and learn something new with each viewing.

It may be also be helpful to combine this DVD with Master Yang's book of the same title. His theories, history and application of Taiji make for an excellent education of the art form. I recommend this DVD for any serious student of Taiji from beginner to advanced student. There is something to be learned for everyone interested in Taiji.",1258416000,,1277,4.572052401746725
3401736,5,B00172TIOE,"Once again Dr. Yang presents us with an incredible compilation of  martial techniques from yet another of the Yang-style forms.  Yang, Ban-Hou's form that is presented here contains differences than the more common forms passed down by his brother Yang, Cheng-Fu.  Dr. Yang presents a interesting look at the differences and offers his own understandings based on personal study of 49 treatises of Yang Tai Chi Chuan written by Yang, Ban-How.

While this DVD presents the rare 37-posture form passed down by Yang, Ban-Hou, the video showcases over 75 possible applications of standard Yang tai chi postures, all of which can be found in other Yang forms. Dr. Yang also demonstrates application relationships to pushing hands and tai chi chin na concepts that appear in several of his other publications.  Since Dr. Yang clearly wishes to further strengthen the student's understanding of the complexities and relationships of tai chi movement, posture, breathing, jing, and coiling, this video presents detail that is sometimes beyond the reach and understanding of beginning tai chi students or those wishing to practice tai chi only for health.  For this reason, I would not recommend this DVD for those looking to begin tai chi study, but for the experienced practitioners.  For those who are experienced, this video is an invaluable treasure chest full of enlightening analysis and martial applications.",1257897600,2,1407,5.2825112107623315

3401738,5,B00172TIOE,"This DVD is informative to all styles of Tai Chi.
My review won't be as long as the other reviews, but I wanted to say that this is very well produced DVD.  This DVD is awesome.

Dr Yang has picked 37 Tai Chi postures that he believes to be representative of all the forms in Tai Chi and demonstrates them on students, explains the application, and then has the students do the forms.  The students are not fully accomplished experts yet and so they make mistakes while trying the posture applications.  These mistakes are representative of common mistakes and Dr Yang corrects the mistakes while explaining why they would make the mistake and why they should do it the correct way.

The photography and DVD menu selection are also very good.
You do not have to know the Tai Chi form to benefit from this DVD, although being familiar with the postures will be helpful.
Also viewing this will be helpful with your form practice as you will have a better understanding of how the form works; and how and why you should position your body.

Also, I thought this was much easier to understand than the book of similar title.  But after watching this DVD I went back to the book and it made more sense to me.  Seeing the applications in motion on a DVD is really helpful.

I recommend this for anybody that wants to do Tai Chi beyond just copying their teacher.",1251676800,15,1356,4.479674796747967
3401739,5,B00172TIOE,"I heartily recommend this DVD for anyone in the beginner to high intermediate levels of learning taiji. In particular, it's best for those who are not rank beginners, who know a short form and are looking for more. This presentation:
* Offers a lecture-overview of the practical fundamentals of taiji
* Shows Dr. Yang doing a modified version of his Yang short form
* Shows Dr. Yang discussing each one of the 37 positions of the Yang short form and demonstrating its martial applications with a partner.

You will not get everything out of this DVD after one or even a handful of viewings. Rather, I got the sense that it is a DVD to return to often in different stages of your training because there are important concepts here that you will only be ready for as your knowledge and form progress.

I was getting back into taiji after a ten-year hiatus and a friend suggested I take a look at this DVD. Not only was it the perfect refresher that helped me fit right in to a level 2 taiji class at my gym, but as a former aikidoka I was pleasantly surprised to see martial applications that took me back to my aikido days; blocks, throws, joint locks and more lay behind the flowing motions. I had never guessed they were there because my former teachers had never talked about the martial applications... Now, I'm not at the level that I can use any of these applications yet, but just knowing that they're present reminds me to focus on my form and posture to avoid picking up bad habits in my training.

As I hinted before, there's a lot packed into the lectures and demonstrations that will help practitioners of different skill levels.

For beginners, the initial lecture is great because it gives you a sense that taiji really isn't just about waving your arms slowly as you move around; rather there is a discrete body of techniques that describe the foundation of the art. Too, the discussion of the adaptation of the style by various Yang family patriarchs teaches that the patterns you learn from your teachers are, first of all, not set in stone and, second, adaptable for practitioners of all sizes and shapes. The demonstrations are great--but don't worry about trying to figure out the martial applications now. Instead, Dr. Yang will draw attention to the part of the form where the actual ""work"" occurs. That is, he tells you exactly which movements are the most essential to execute correctly.

More intermediate practitioners who are more experienced will get more out of the applications. Furthermore, Dr. Yang notes which ones are particularly common and effective in push-hands.

The single most important thing that Dr. Yang tries to teach in this DVD, however, is not just technique or even specific applications themselves. His overarching purpose is to teach advanced students how to ""read"" a form, how to take a short or long form and to analyze it, visualize it, and understand the logic and theory that lie behind it.

Me--I'm nowhere near that level now and it will probably be years before I get there. However, there are a host of skills, techniques and tidbits packed into this presentation that I will be enjoying as I slowly work towards that point.

In summary, then, some quick pros and cons:
Pros:
* The DVD grows with you. Watch it once and you'll realize you need to watch it again (and again) to learn more.
* I love that you can jump to any of the 37 positions/applications. I'm learning the Beijing short form which is different from the classical Yang but this way I jump quickly to the position I'm looking for.
* It reinforces that taiji really is a martial art, not just a slow-moving exercise and thus form and execution matter!

Cons:
* The only regret I have about the DVD is that I didn't get the accompanying book too. In the lecture, Dr. Yang mentions some things (13 postures?) that he doesn't explain; the way he alludes to them, however, suggests that they are laid out in full in the book.
