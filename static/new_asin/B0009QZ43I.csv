Thus a 2-DVD anthology (+ 50 page book) promise great rewards for the underserved fan.

Disc one contains an hour-long ""Critical Review of BDDDB"" which is comprised of brief (too brief!) excerpts from their appearances on various BBC shows, interspersed with 2005 interviews from ex-members Neil Innes, Roger Ruskin Spear and Rodney Slater, and commentary by critics Chris Welch, Hugh Fielder, Malcolm Dome and manager Gerry Bron. The pantomimed performances are mostly new to DVD, and the interviews are illuminating.

Disc two contains six minutes (3 songs) from the 1966 New Faces television programme, a 15-minute documentary on the post-Bonzos career of Vivian Stanshall (featuring the same commentators as on disc 1, plus footage from Viv's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sir-Henry-at-Rawlinson-End-Regions-2-4/dp/B002A6LKUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sir Henry at Rawlinson End [Regions 2 & 4</a>] movie and a 1974 TV appearance), another 15 minutes on the brilliant career of Neil Innes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rutles-All-You-Need-is-Cash/dp/B00004ZEU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rutles - All You Need is Cash</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Monty-Python-s-Flying-Circus-16-Ton-Megaset/dp/B0009XRZ92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Monty Python's  Flying Circus 16 Ton Megaset</a>, The Raggy Dolls, etc.), an early B&W video for ""I'm The Urban Spaceman"" and a colour one for Neil's ""Eye Candy,"" and seven original 78-rpm novelty songs from the '20s later covered by the Bonzos (all included, by the way, in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Songs-the-Bonzo-Dog-Band-Taught-Us-A-Prehistory/dp/B000KRNF6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Songs the Bonzo Dog Band Taught Us: A Prehistory</a>&nbsp;-- although curiously no composer/performer credits are listed here).  Each disc also includes a rather bogus ""image gallery"" of 10 screen captures from the material on the disc.

The book bound into the box is a track-by-track breakdown of the Bonzos output by Chris Welch, which is a minor addition at best, with such lame comments as ""Music critics raved as 'Gorilla' proved a joy.""  At only 2 hours 11 minutes, all of the material on this pair of discs could easily have fit onto a single DVD... but this boxed set is such a lovely memento made with real love & affection that I'm not going to complain.",1296345600,4,2778,6.491891891891892
