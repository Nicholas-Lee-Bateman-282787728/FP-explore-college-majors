Now for my review.

This was 10 times better than what 4kids did! The diolouge was better than what 4kids did! But, I was dissapointed that in the englidh trailer they still stuck with the dubbed names! But it's really no big deal. Now, people always complain about how the dub is turned into a kiddie show with less violence etc. But now, come on people! there really wasn't a whole lot cut out! Yeah, there was one part with blood cut out big deal! and the story really wasn't changed that much either. I'm just telling the facts! Parents if your going to but your kids this DVD don't be cautioned. so they say damn like once or twice big deal! don;t worry.",1106352000,,847,4.458064516129032
2144114,4,B0002Y4SG6,"I was so happy to hear that they were going to be releasing Uncut Shaman King on DVD.  Much like the Uncut Yu-gi-oh DVDs, there really wasn't anything to be cut on these two DVDs.  It is nice to see the original name for Amidamaru's sword (Harusame) and attack (Amida-style Halo Blade) but, aside from a couple of name changes (Rio to Ryu), little is changed.  The nonsensical decision to remove the symbols from the spell talismans has been undone, but other that that, there isn't much.  But that will probable change once Faust VIII makes his appearance...",1099785600,,559,4.673469387755102
2144115,5,B0002Y4SG6,"For the first time in America, 4Kids will be releasing Uncut Shaman King DVDs. This DVD includes three episodes, ""A Boy Who Dances With Ghosts"", ""Waiting Samurai"", and ""Len Tao"". The episode titles are different to match up with the original Japanese versions, which by the way WILL BE ON THESE DVDs!!! These DVDs are going to look so good on my shelf, alongside the Yu-Gi-Oh! DVDs and the other Shaman King disc, ""Perfect Posession"". I'd reccomend this DVD along with DVD 2 to any Shaman King fan!

Note to Parents: This DVD is Uncut, and contains violence, swearing, and mild nudity (nothing shows).",1093478400,,601,4.778846153846154
8034707,3,B0002Y4SG6,"A massive Shaman King fan, I will just be legit with you when I say this: The Shaman King anime is not good. You may think I'm just saying that because it's common to hate on english dubs, but It's the sad truth. Do not buy this DVD if you want a good introduction to this amazing series. Instead, just read the manga. However, if you're as big a fan as I am for Hiroyuki Takei's work, buying this for collecting sake is acceptable.",1508112000,,432,4.154761904761905

8034713,5,B0002Y4SG6,"what I like about this uncut version,

is it has the same voices actors from the

4kids dub version, and they are great!

there not bad actors just the TV dub script was meant for kids.

but the uncut DVD  hads more drama and a good story plot,

and they don't sound silly,

so if you tape the show and watch the DVD

it will blow you away!

the same characters you like do to they was funny on TV

transform to cool more interesting characters.",1144454400,,445,4.069767441860465

The music is better, and the kids voices don't sound like women taking hits of helium before every scene.",1108598400,,247,4.857142857142857
