8018082,4,B0001Y4LFA,"The rest of this great series NEEDS to be released!  It can't end after just 3 dvds, with so much more to be seen and revealed about Gandora, the Wolf's Crest, and the Hyribead!

Please complete this awesome series on dvd.  It's everything ""GoBots"" should have been, and so much more.

Additionally, seeing this show at last has rekindled my enthusiasm for the classic, but vastly underappreciated toyline of Machine Robo.  If you like diecast transforming robots, check this entire series out and you'll discover what you've been missing!

Thank you.",1131667200,3,551,5.0
