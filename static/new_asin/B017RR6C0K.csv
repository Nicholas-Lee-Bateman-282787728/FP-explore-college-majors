Beautifully written and filmed.  Captured life in small town Texas, with its joys and desperation.  The characters were very relatable and engaging.  As a life long Texan, I'm pretty sure I've met Reno's mom at the DQ a couple of times.  Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and will watch again.",1456963200,3,447,6.928571428571429

7513002,5,B017RR6C0K,A great warm inspiring movie. Miss Poots is wonderful.,1456876800,2,54,5.111111111111111
7513033,4,B017RR6C0K,Nice light Drama. Imogen is a delight. And Mackenzie is delicious.,1468540800,,66,5.090909090909091
7513034,1,B017RR6C0K,"Very slow-paced, restrained, indie drama about family matters that you've seen down much better many, many times, even in an indie film. Imogen Poots, usually a very spirited, British actress, just doesn't seem to have her heart in the role and just goes through the motions with little affect. I almost gave it two stars since it is harmless enough, but I really had to struggle to stay interested in this film and decided on one, especially since I've seen so many, ""big city girl/guy is pulled back to small town home to mend family relations"" films, and of course the small town folk are much more real and insightful into the human condition compared to those jaded, city folk. Condescending, to say the least. About what you've come to expect on Netfilx Streaming, these days.",1466553600,,782,4.757352941176471
7513035,4,B017RR6C0K,"I found this by accident and really enjoyed it.  Well done writing, acting and cinematography.  Poots was terrific.",1465171200,,115,5.333333333333333
7513036,2,B017RR6C0K,Not my choice for a Friday night.,1464307200,,33,3.857142857142857
7513037,3,B017RR6C0K,"Lots of positives with this work by producer Anna Axster. Beautifully shot picture, acoustical guitar tracks that back the movie were really good too. Poots was very believable if not excellent in the lead role. If you grew up in small town America (especially in the south or southwest) a lot of this film will resonate. It's hard to ever really escape those beginnings literally or figuratively.

Unfortunately the glaring miss here was far too much of the character Reno or Margaret and too little of Bingham's hard scrabble character Jack.",1459382400,,543,4.967032967032967
7513038,3,B017RR6C0K,a little slow. should have been maybe an hour long. why do people think they have to make something that's 2 hours long?,1458777600,,120,4.260869565217392

7513040,3,B017RR6C0K,Not bad. Like a better/different version of Elizabethtown but not as good soundtrack. Sorry Ryan :(,1457827200,,99,5.25

8740147,5,B017RR6C0K,Anna creates the most beautiful work either music videos shorts or this.  Her eye for emotions paired with her love of music moves you into places that's hard to find.,1535587200,,167,4.566666666666666

8740150,3,B017RR6C0K,"This independent film caught my eye because Mary McCormack and June Squibb were in this film and I picked it up at a library sale of all places. Imogen Poots does a decent job in playing Ellie Edwards, a 26 year old Los Angeles aspiring furniture designer, who gets the telephone call about her estranged father in his hometown in Texas. She goes there upon his death and connects with people like her paternal grandparents (June Squibb and Norman Bennett). Mary McCormack's Amanda is a train wreck in appearance and personality. She has a grown son and a young grandson.

The surprising relationship is the friendship between Ellie and Reno (Mackenzie Davis). Reno was born Margaret but dressed and acts like a man. Reno is an aspiring singer and musician. Their friendship never seems to cross the delicate line. Ellie seemed more interested in Amanda's son, Jack, than Reno in that light. Ellie stays for the funeral and never seems to return to Los Angeles so easily.

The DVD doesn't have any special features about the film. It would have been nice to see the making of the movie or how it came about in the first place. The film has some charm and humor though. The characters are relatable too. There are many unanswered questions too by the end of the film. The film ends on a positive and hopeful note though.",1524096000,,1319,4.656652360515022
8740151,5,B017RR6C0K,"Very nice low key film with interesting characters and excellent acting. The incident at the funeral home is black comedy at its best! This film, although a indie feature, is far superior to many big budget movies that try to rely on special effects more than the story content or acting.",1516924800,,288,4.666666666666667
8740152,5,B017RR6C0K,"Heart warming, personal and touching. Enjoyed this movie very much.",1507420800,,67,5.8

8740155,4,B017RR6C0K,A cute little movie and okay for passing a couple of hours. Not one of the greats by any means.,1471219200,,95,3.8
8740156,2,B017RR6C0K,"The music was good.  Characters did not seem believable to me in any way.  The main character had this ridiculous boyfriend that she dumped then wouldn't even kiss the hottie from the small Texas town, bad mistake.",1470787200,2,214,4.756756756756757
