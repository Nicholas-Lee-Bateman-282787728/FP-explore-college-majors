7978718,1,B000083EFE,"I tried playing this video on every DVD player I have and it would not play. I used my computer to watch it and it took several tries to see it. What a disappointing film, this is like Gay Samurai Twilight if that interest you. Could not watch it all, it was not even worth my time, the story and plot is all about Samurai that are interested in young boys or men.",1487462400,,364,4.0
