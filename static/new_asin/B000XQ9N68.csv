I particularly liked the village that had ''canals"" running through it.  If I ever go to China, I would base my trip on this DVD.",1393977600,,258,4.953488372093023

This is a finely made dvd, one which music lovers will admire.  There are also many chinese instruments relatively unkown to westerners, with sounds and melodies alien to us.

The music accompanies you as you tour through various parts of China.
The price is also very good at $9.99.  I highly recommend this dvd.",1204243200,5,500,7.016129032258065
