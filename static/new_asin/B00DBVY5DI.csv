like watching again & again.  This is about rejected kids who try
to survive :  theme existing in many parts of the Third World.",1399593600,,184,4.228571428571429

We all know about the tragedy of throw away kids, but this very personal account gets under the skin in its ability to dissect things well.  It shows the sad depths of human possibility, but it also shows the wonderful, spiritually-evolved possibilities.  Did it impact me after the viewing was over?  Yes.
