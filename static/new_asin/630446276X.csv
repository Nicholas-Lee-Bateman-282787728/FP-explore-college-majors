Wish there were more NOVA episodes like this !!",1416873600,,253,5.195121951219512
7872661,5,630446276X,"This video, a NOVA episode from 1987, is highly recommended to anyone interested in astronomy. It is a documentary about the IRAS (Infra-Red Astronomical Satellite), which was the first satellite able to see infrared light (i.e., heat), and therefore to expand our views of the universe beyond the realm of visible light. This video explains how this breakthrough added to our knowledge of the universe; for instance, it showed us the actual shape of our galaxy and provided the first bit of direct evidence that other stars have planetary systems. I think anyone who enjoys science, especially astronomy, will find this video very informative and enjoyable.",1265155200,,658,5.216981132075472
