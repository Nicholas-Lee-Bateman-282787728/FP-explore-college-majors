8324425,5,B00001WY7S,"This program has a wonderful and broad capacity to inform and inspire. There is a section that allows for learning some Qigong practices, but more importantly this is a revelation of the incredible potential of Qigong. There is information here about the potential for a health care revolution based on self-reliance - a lost American value in health care.

There are numberous practices demonstrated and a remarkable section where Dr Jahnke discusses the roots of Qigong and its awesome nature as a practice of Mind/Body Energetics.

Highly recommended as a companion to Dr Jahnke's two important books:
