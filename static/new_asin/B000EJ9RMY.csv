2521729,5,B000EJ9RMY,"The DVD is not cheap, but it is worth it. Seeing Hogan's swing repeated so many times is fantastic. My main complaint is that there are too many in slow motion and not enough at full speed -- I think the full speed ones at the beginning are the most valuable. Also the music and narration can be a bit grating if you watch the DVD over and over, but you always have the option to turn off the sound. And the fact that I've watched it so many times is an indication of how valuable I think the video is.",1239926400,,502,3.98019801980198
2521730,4,B000EJ9RMY,"There is so little available footage of Hogan swinging so to the extent of the video portion, this dvd is indeed a treat for any Hogan fan. However, as a golf instructor, I suggest turning off the volume so as not to be distracted or misled by Mr. Darracott's overly complex, presumtive, inaccurate and rather sophomoric ""analysis.""",1236124800,,332,4.842105263157895
2521731,5,B000EJ9RMY,"A close analysis of these films proved without a doubt what John Schlee taught me to be Ben Hogan's secret was indeed the real deal.  I can see it as plain as the nose on my face.  My own DVD ""On Target Power"" and my book, ""The Secret to a Great Golf Swing"" reveal just what Hogan did to be the greatest ball striker.

8110692,5,B000EJ9RMY,"I've had two VHS tapes of this that didn't age well. The DVD will hopefully solve that. From my experience, turn off the audio after watching once or twice. Enjoy the rare footage of actually watching Hogan swing. This is the same resolution as the VHS but still very informative. I recommend it to any Hogan fan.",1503532800,,313,4.508771929824562

8110696,5,B000EJ9RMY,"A gem, you will want to watch it over and over. The slow motion portions are the model everyone should follow.",1360022400,,110,4.285714285714286
8110697,3,B000EJ9RMY,"This film of great to see for those who remember The Great Ben Hogan.
Anyone who knew him knows that his achievements came from his dilligent attention to detail and his endless hours devoted to practice.  There are no short cuts in this game.",1358294400,,243,4.5227272727272725
8110698,2,B000EJ9RMY,"But if you have not looked it would be a good buy.  Mostly practice swings, thought there would be more on course.",1358208000,,114,4.181818181818182
8110699,4,B000EJ9RMY,"probably best record of Hogan's post accident swing.  According to Ben, he was ""not even close"" to pre-accident physical ability.  Still, the swing is a wonder of controlled power.  As noted by other reviews, the narration and music are, to be polite, ""in the way"" and should be turned off----I actually play some classical music while watching it.  If you want to actually watch Hogan playing a round, there is only one choice----Shell's Snead vs. Hogan.",1326240000,,455,4.947368421052632
8110700,1,B000EJ9RMY,"I was hoping to see Ben Hogan playing a round of golf on the Masters Course.  Instead, I saw him hitting practice shot after practice shot on the driving range with a narrative that was nothing short of mundane.  I would appreciate my total refund, as this is not anything I would ever watch again, nor refer to any friend.  Totally disappointing to me.",1311206400,,353,4.484375
8110701,3,B000EJ9RMY,The video's of Hogan's swings are priceless.  The full speed swings at the beginning are what make it worth while.  Far too many stop action swings and the commentary is of very little value.  Playing it with the sound off is much preferred.,1252886400,,241,4.558139534883721
