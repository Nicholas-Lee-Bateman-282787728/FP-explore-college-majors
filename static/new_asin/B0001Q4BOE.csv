2023594,3,B0001Q4BOE,"This is the sequel to the popular comedy of 2 years ago. Almost the entire cast is back, and the sequel feels tighter and stronger.
  The populist, pro-small business, message is carried over from the first film. Calvin (Ice Cube) is running the barbershop started by his late father. When a chain hair cutting place opens across the street and the neighborhood begins to gentrify, Calvin must decide whether to sell out or rally the neighborhood to his cause. The role of the barbershop in the community is celebrated, particularly in a subplot involving Eddie (the excellent Cedric the Entertainer, whose role is greatly expanded) saving the shop from being destroyed by rioters in the '60s. Cedric provides most of the laughs, and handles the serious scenes well too, this is a breakout performance.
  The ending of the film is entirely predictable, yet throughly enjoyable, so let's just mention that the cast is uniformly good, especially Troy Garity as the lone white barber, Kenan Thompson as Calvin's inept cousin, Robert Wisdom as a crooked politician, and Queen Latifah, who brings an anarchic energy to her small role as the owner of the neighboring beauty shop.
  BARBERSHOP 2 celebrates the importance of neighborhood and community in an era of increasing homogenization. This is a comedy for everyone. Recommended.",1077494400,2,1328,5.096774193548387
2023595,3,B0001Q4BOE,"Barbershop was a great film about community and family that really stuck a chore for me, but the sequel did not live up to those values. Ceric The Entertainer is good, as well as Queen Latifah but the story lacks the heart and humor of the first movie, and falls to gutter talk other than honest views about people and society that the first one did so well. It's a funny movie but nothing more than a quick laugh for a quick buck.
Maybe it's about time to close up the shop before it gets worse.",1077062400,,496,4.177083333333333
2023596,5,B0001Q4BOE,"Usually sequals are not as good as the first time around but absolutley not in this case. BarberShop 2: Back in Business was a good movie and is better than the 2002 box office smash original. With such folks like Ice Cube, funnyman Cedric The Entertainer, rapper/actress Eve, and the whole gang back plus Queen Latifah, you can't go wrong.
This is what makes me love wholesome black movies with a positive message in them. BarberShop 2 came from the heart. It's story and true-to-life experiences of what happens in our African-American communities. Times changing and out with the old and in with the new. The movie showed how the characters developed and were improving on themselves in different ways. Eve (Terri) getting rid of her bagage with her last boyfriend (the dog in the original), Ricky (Michael Ealy)trying to do better in life and stay out of trouble and getting his GED, Dinka getting a new love. Look out for some secrets. Also Calvin (Ice cube) has a new born baby and a cousin who starts work at the legendary shop (Kenan Thompson) but ends up messing up everything in the process.
Not only does BarberShop 2 have good characters but Cedric The Entertainer brings the comedy and the laugh out loud segments of the movie. As in the first, Eddie (Cedric) plays the ol' school, funny loving, opinonated barber who has helmed up the barbershop with his ol' school wit and remarkable topics of conversation based on black celebrities like R. Kelly, Michael Jackson, Kobe Bryant,Mariah Carey, Tiger Woods, Vin Diseal and knows not to talk about the R&B icon Luther Vandross because of illness. He also disses Trent Lott, President Bush, Osma Bin-Laden and has historical flashbacks to the late 1960s early 1970s that help the audience get the signifigace of the legenary shop with the death of Dr. Martin Luther King and a funny flashback to a Black Panther era. Barbershop 2 has warmth and true to heart feelings that remind you of the comedy of movies like ""Friday"" and the heart-warming appeal of ""Soul Food"". Movies like this are a must in our culture.
The movie overall is a must-see. If you liked the first, you'll love the second one even better.",1076716800,7,2167,4.750663129973475
2023597,4,B0001Q4BOE,"And the business is running smoothly in its routine schedule.  The first Barbershop film really is a breakthrough to me when it comes to actually be interested in black cinema.  Most black films I've seen in my time before that movie came are either depressing(Losing Isaiah) or dull for the developing mind(How High).  Barbershop didn't make me feel either one of these emotions; that movie has made my day a good one, because it's not only hilarious, but it show deep values of appreciating running a barber shop business and the hard work and effort the place has been put on for years without change its true nature, plus the thoughtfulness on the characters that work in it.  I admit there were past black movies that were better than that, but still, Barbershop holds a special place in my heart.  It didn't really surprise me to see that, due to popular demand, that a sequel was in the mix, Barbershop 2: Back in Business, and not surprising to me after watching it, it's more of the same thing.
After the over-the-top, high budget intro with the people getting their haircuts while showing slides of revolutionary and current well-known black people in a low opacity at quickspeed interpreting the development of black history from then 'till now, the story begins with a flashback of Cedric's character, in the 1967 era, going to the barbershop for the first time and how he got involved with the shop, though I wouldn't use the word ""involved"" from Cedric's situation. From then on, it showed the present-day barber shop running well until a successful conglomerate moves into the neighborhood to construct a high-budget barber shop for friendly competition; in other words, taking down a small shop.  As he is one of many power-hungry businessmen trying to buy run-down stores and nip-and-tuck the inner-beauty of the neighborhood in Chicago as a means of some land reconstruction law, the barber shop crew and the community experienced some ups-and-downs in these current events, but hey, it's all going to be work out in the end.
The story's plot construction is like connect-the-dots, but that's alright, 'cause the movie is laugh-out-loud funny.  All of the cast from the first movie are back in this sequel, including some newcomers, Queen Latifah and Kenan Thompson(Ah yeah! The original ""All That"" star is on Barbershop 2. He-hey!) Some of these original characters also have went through a life-changing experience:  Ice Cube's character, Calvin, is more serious in keeping his business alive and supporting his family; Eve's character, Terri, tries  to get away from her typical [expletive deleted] self, and reach into her ""peaceful, spiritual"" self towards people she abhors; and Michael Ealy's Ricky Nash is less of a criminal and more laid-back, but was actually trying to do something important to his life that nobody wants to know.  Even if the characters changed themselves of their expressive appearances, it's good to know that they're the same people I've laughed at from the first film.  What got me curiously interested about this movie is Cedric's character and his back stories.  His character, Eddie, is more focused and explanatory in this sequel, and that left me with mixed feelings.  The b-stories do explain how he got to the barber shop, how he sees the shop as his second home, and how he respect Calvin's father as a barber enough to turn his life around.  However, thought touching, these b-stories left a little inconclusive.  The same goes for the b-story on Eddie's relationship with some girl he seen on a subway, which I find also rushed and lenient.
These back stories point out on the movie's downsides: the big one, lack of artistic direction.  I figured this sequel was directed by a different person, but the movie could've done so much with ideas that could've made this made this movie very different from the original.  The first movie was fresh in interventions on discussive issues on black historians and celebrities, and people act how they feel without anything extreme; the second film was more along of the same interventions and I don't see how this was heading to a different route, so it felt more refurbushed than something fresh out of the box.  On a personal note, I was beefed with Queen Latifah's character as a spunky, hair-stylish next door.  She appear in this movie as a special appearance, but there was a lot of scenes on her, but yet, nothing deep came from her character.  More of her character without focus on the depth makes her a liability, and that sets me off.
I don't want to open up and say this is superior to the original, 'cause honestly, it ain't.  It isn't as thought-provoking as the first film, but in all respects, the things that I like from the first Barbershop came in this sequel, but more refined with a few surprises(Come on, now!  Kenan Thompson is in this movie!).  Barbershop 2 is still a worthy sequel, and I'm lovin' this.",1076457600,3,4931,4.85799522673031
2023598,4,B0001Q4BOE,"This is a wonderful sequel to BARBERSHOP; one of the factors that makes it so enjoyable is that the director and producers chose to build on the strengths of that film rather than attempt to duplicate it. Calvin (Ice Cube) and Eddie (Cedric The Entertainer) head the ensemble cast that we got to know in the first film, and Queen Latifah once again exhibits her charm on the screen. The main storyline is very straightforward and reflects a conflict that takes place in countless cities across the country: the effect of change on the neighborhood. What appears as progress to the agents of change may in fact pose a threat to the established order of things. But the attraction of this film is clearly not due to a unique or suspenseful storyline, but rather to the interaction of the characters and the questions which the film raises and the history which the story reveals. We met everyone in the debut film and got acquainted with their home turf - Calvin's BARBERSHOP on the South Side of Chicago. Now we feel like we get to know them and understand them, see their progress and learn how they have coped with life.
The film opens with an historical flashback, and this technique is employed repeatedly and effectively throughout the film. Much of Eddie's past is introduced in this way, and we develop a real understanding of the life experiences which inform his homespun observations. We also learn that his help for Calvin's father in protecting the barbershop from harm during the riots and looting of the sixties is the genesis of his lifetime ""free chair"" at the shop. The plot is nominally about a next generation upscale Nappy Cutz salon preparing to open across the street as part of a major neighborhood redevelopment plan. Of course, the threat to Calvin and his employees is obvious, and as is usually the case in such situations, there are neighborhood divisions about the political deals which are being made and concern about the disruption of lives which may result.
This is in many ways a much more subtle film than the original.  The most explosive racial situations which are portrayed took place in the past, which makes them a lot less threatening. Cedric's rhetoric in this film is certainly unlikely to create the loud (and mostly ignored) protests which the first film evoked from the professional arbiters of political correctness and those complainers constantly aggrieved by every imagined slight. The offensive language has also been considerably toned down and the sexual innuendos are infrequent and low key.  So this is as much fun as the original BARBERSHOP but without the shock value. However, serious questions about how people achieve their goals in life, the obstacles to be overcome, and the question of identity (individual as well as neighborhood) are all seriously examined in a very enjoyable film. So while this is not a masterpiece it definitely is a very worthwhile hour and a half and a chance to catch up with some friends from the last film. One caution is necessary in that regard, however. THIS IS A SEQUEL THAT WILL BE MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE AND MEANINGFUL IF YOU FIRST WATCH THE ORIGINAL (as long as the language is not too offensive). The relationships developed among the characters in the first movie are often built upon in this one, and that background and feeling of familiarity was an integral part of my enjoyment of this film.

2023599,4,B0001Q4BOE,"One of the best segments from the Eddie Murphy/Arsenio Hall picture, COMING TO AMERICA, centered around each actor playing multiple characters at a barbershop.  Every character was unique, and every character had his own take on life.  When the original BARBERSHOP was released, I looked forward to much of that same banter.  Once the box office took off like a shot and word of mouth spread, it upset me that of all the movies I see in a year, I actually missed this one.  So, one night, I rented the video, popped some corn, and spent the night wondering why I wasn't seeing more of the barbershop.  I can't remember much of what went on, other than it seemed like the filmmakers spent way too much time on the subplot and too little time in the actual barbershop.  Whether or not that is completely accurate doesn't much matter, since I was bored to tears and don't care to revisit it.  However, with that said, I am very pleased to report that BARBERSHOP 2 manages to do everything right that, in my opinion, went wrong with our first visit.  Not only do we hear more from Cedric the Entertainer, we also visit his past which at times is comical, but at other times deeply moving.  This film has a message, but it doesn't shove it down your throat.  It has a series of subplots, but they all add to the flow of the movie, instead of distracting you from why you bought the ticket in the first place.  All of the performers have their moment in the spotlight and now the idea of the forthcoming BEAUTY SHOP doesn't seem like such a bad idea afterall.  Congratulations BARBERSHOP 2!  Not only are you better than the original, but you are vastly better!",1076284800,,1655,4.476666666666667
2023600,5,B0001Q4BOE,"I gave ""Barbershop"" a three star review, so it was surprising to me when I walked out of ""Barbershop 2"" amazed on how much better it was from the first. Don't get me wrong, I like the first one better now, but ""Barbershop 2"" is one of those rare sequals where it's better than the first, and it's a brand new idea with fresh new humor. ""Barbershop 2"" is a movie about change. Throughout the entire movie, everything that happens around the barbershop is changing. The neighborhood, some of the buildings and stores, and people's minds. In the first film, everybody in the stores around the shop are standing firm and not worrying about being taken over by money. In the second film, everybody wants to change because of money, except for the barbershop. There is a huge difference in characters from the first movie to the second.
In ""Barbershop 2"" Calvin Palmer is a new father, who owns his fathers barbershop from 1958. The many people who work in his shop begin with Issac, the only white barber, who claims that he is the best in the shop. There is the african Dinka, who has a crush on the only women barber Terri. But Terri seems to have feelings with ex-thug Ricky, who is trying to get his life back on track, but also shares the same feelings for Terri. Calvin's cousin Kernard is coming right out of barber school, and Calvin gives him a job in the shop. The former barber of the shop Jimmy, is working for politician Alderman Brown, but he is still a regular customer. Calvin's ex-girlfriend Gina owns the beauty shop next door. As Calvin tries to get through his day with the bickering and loud conversation, he is facing his own problems. A vacent lot across the street turns out to be a new hair salon called Nappy Cutz. Calvin decides that he can't have the shop shut down, as it is a neighborhood landmark, so he decides to style up the place. We also hear the story of old barber Eddie, who does not have to pay rent for his chair at the shop because of a story where he stands up to the rioters after the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination. But as the days go on, Calvin does not know what to do to be able to keep his customers who have been coming for years and years.
""Barbershop 2"" really has better humor than the first. My favorite scene is where Gina and Eddie are having an arguement during a BBQ. Just listening to how well their comments play off on each other just adds to the fun that the orignal ""Barbershop"" movie created for us. Throughout both of these films, you could like the characters, and because of ""Barbershop 2"" you could just grow to liking them even more. The sequal could be seen without having seen the first, but the first one makes the second one great. ""Barbershop 2"" is one of the best films of the year so far.
ENJOY!

The world changes, but some things never go out of style from current events and politics to relationships and love, you can still say anything you want at the barbershop. Barbershop 2: Back in Business is a decent sequel with some enjoyable moments. The sequel is a bit more warm hearted this time around but the dialog is still sharp and funny. If you liked the first one then you will probably like this one too.",1263859200,,744,4.730769230769231
2023741,3,B0001Q4BOE,"Calvin (Ice Cube) inherited his fathers Barbershop a few years back. At first he wasn't to happy with having the shop, but now the shop is a part of him. Calvin is now a rear part of the community, a corner stone of it. But change is coming into the neighborhood. Old shops, homes, and buildings are being bought out by a bigger corporation and replacing them with chains of restaurants, coffee houses, and even barbershops. And one of the barbershops, Nappy Cuts, is moving in right across from Calvin's shop. They offer nice chairs, better pampering, basketball courts, big screen TV's, and even fish in the floor you can pick out and get them cooked anyway you want it. Change is coming, and it isn't going to be pretty. To hopefully keep his shop as well as other peoples shops open, Calvin and the gang try their best to bring the community together to fight what some would consider the inevitable.

I'm sure I'll be in the minority here, but I liked part 2 a lot more than part 1. I laughed more, the characters weren't as cookie cutter as in part 1 (but they still are somewhat), and the story was more enjoyable this time through... for me at least. I liked that it dealt with major corporations coming in and trying to undercut the competition to run them out of business. It felt a little more real than, the first movie where Calvin is being a little emo about inheriting a barbershop from his father, selling it, then trying to get it back. And the cast, well, I liked that they were a little less involved, but still there. You really don't pay attention to the fact that `everyone thinks the bad boy is just clubbin and having sex all the time at night, but what they don't know is that he's studying and trying to get an education', you know... things like that. And I really think the movie was a lot funnier than the first one. I laughed pretty hard at some things this time through. Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) at one point is cooking some free burgers, and a little girl said hers was burnt. They argue about it and Eddie snatches it and throws it away. She goes and tell on him while Eddie is saying ""Go on! Go tell! I aint scurred of nuthin!"" Then Gina (Latifah) comes storming out the other shop yelling at Eddie. All Eddie says is ""OH SHOOT!"" (but cusses) and the look on his face is just priceless. So predictable, but so funny.

I said barbershop 1 was a definite rent, and I would say the same with this. I'm glad I own them both, because even though they are very by the book, they are still some light hearted fun.

P.S. - Kenan Thompson (Calvin's cousin)...is not funny. I have never laughed when that kid is trying to be funny. He's horrible on SNL also and just about anything he's been on. Even when he was on Nickelodeon. That guy just bugs me. OH... and that's just my opinion.",1242604800,,2815,4.378585086042065

2023746,3,B0001Q4BOE,"Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer and Eve return, reprising their characters in ""Barbershop 2: Back in Business"". It's not as good as the first film, I didn't think, but it's still worth a look if you enjoyed the antics of the characters in the first film.

Calvin (Ice Cube) is proud of his barbershop, and of his community on the south side of Chicago. Guys can come in, get a hair cut, have a conversation, get some things off their chest. It's a great place, but it may not last. There's some new plans for their block. New types of stores, new types of customers. Doesn't bother Calvin and the gang too much until they hear of plans for a new ""Nappy Cuts"" hairdressing franchise to open across the street. They've got everything a guy could want in there, latest razors and scissors, a TV, fish in an aquarium. You can even play basketball in there! Will the local barbershop be able to handle the competition?

The characters are still as interesting, and there are a couple of nice jokes in there, but I didn't like this film as much as the first. It seemed a little more padded, I guess.

Still, it's worth a look if you enjoyed the first, it's all right.",1156636800,,1162,4.420560747663552
2023747,4,B0001Q4BOE,"You really have to see the first Barbershop (2002) to appreciate this sequel, but overall I found this sequel to be the better of the two movies.

If you've gone this long without seeing either film, I'm guessing you've at least heard rumors about the movie's premise.

Barbershop 1 takes a look inside a long staple of the African-American community -- the barbershop (and really black hair salons also) -- where any and everyone is made to feel at home, any and everyone has an opinion and all are welcomed into discussions of politics, race, sex, class and life without the fear of being condemned for ""their personal opinion.""

Using a southside Chicago barbershop that's been passed down from father to son and continues to be a meeting place for the community's four corners, calamity ensues as the lives of one entangles another before ALL come to the rescue to save the day.

This premise is repeated, albeit, more real and less over-the-top in Barbershop 2 than in the first.

The characters became believable, real people with all their own individual quirks instead of being the loud mouth caricatures they appeared to be in the first version.

This movie also does a deceptively clever job of using comic relief to pose true-to-life social issue discussions on history-rooted topics like...

1)How much should we as a society change vs. How much we should retain and stay the same?

2)In the duel of big business & big dollars vs. morality & spirit, which is ""really"" best for the community at large?

3)As it pertains to the African-American cultural identity, how far should blacks go to further ""assimilate"" into the mainstream vs. how much of its past identity should it cling to for the sake of cultural pride and integrity?

I'm sure the overwhelming majority of viewers probably just watched this movie for jokes.

And while it has it's funny moments, pay special attention to the movie's more subtle details (like the opening scenes' use of hair as a motif) and retrospective messages and you'll see there's more to it than a Cedric the Entertainer punchline.

Overall, this movie is what I call ""real"" entertainment.

Highly recommended!",1153353600,,2158,4.895604395604396

2023750,4,B0001Q4BOE,"i saw and loved Barbershop, so when Barbershop 2 came out i was pretty excited, but man, what a let down.

Barbershop 2 had some good stuff, real good stuff and hit more on the social life surrounding the Barbershop and the times of life between the late 60s, 70s, and the new hip hop urban wear era.

movie centers around the area where the barbershop is located, and a group of investors want to come in and buy out the property cause they want to re-develop the area, and to top that off, a new more urban upscale barbershop that has a glass bottom with fish and a baseketball court opens up next to Calvin's barbershop driving away their customers forcing Calvin (Ice Cube) to compete and transform his shop also to an upscale more fashionable store.

to top that off, all the characters have now gone under big changes, which is what i didn't like. Ricky is all of a sudden a school boy who falls in love with Eve, Dinka now has a girlfriend and no longer loves Terri (Eve), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas) now works for the Mayor, Issac is now top dog of the barbershop, and Eddie now has more background story to tell. he isn't as funny as he was in part 1, but some of the parts he comes out in are nice, like the Kennedy-King TV scene where he defends the shop against a mob, or where he first becomes friends with Calvin's dad, and how Cavlin's dad treated him so well, which is why he loves the Barbershop so much. It puts the first Barbershop into better perspective.

my favorite part in the movie was when they Calvin's dad and Eddie were watching the tv and Bobby Kennedy was giving his speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King to a crowd that had no idea he had been shot and killed. it's a touching realistic scene that puts that moment in perfect perspective.

overall, Barbershop 2 is good, it's a nice movie, but if you're a big fan of the first, then part two might disappoint you. i was kind of disappointed. i still like the movie, but it was a let down from the first.",1136678400,,1997,4.300531914893617

2023752,3,B0001Q4BOE,"""Barbershop 2"" is a good movie, but no it does not live up to the standard set by ""Barbershop."" Unfortunately, the film is filled with problems.  First and foremost we realize that these characters are really only interesting within the context of the first film. This film gets too ambitious and lets us see the characters as they travel through time and the city.  I understand that it is to underline the point of this film (and the first one) that small business has more heart and soul than corporations (and I agree...duh). However, Cedric the Entertainer's love life and radicalism of 30 years ago didn't really strike a chord with me.  Also, they take a cheap shot at uptight white men that would've been funny if not completely unoriginal.  But with those problems out of the way, the only thing left to talk about is the good stuff. Here we have a film that resists temptation on more than one occasion.  To the surprise of me an exotic looking fish tank is left unscathed and the ending is not sappy for the sake of being sappy.  I also like the performances by Eve and Cedric the Entertainer.  The scene in which Cedric goes at it with Queen Latifah at a picnic is probably my personal favorite.  I also enjoy movies that deal with topical conversations.  All these are the reasons why I am recommending this film.  Of course while bashing the corporations this film played at multiplexes across the country, ironic? I would say it falls victim to the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" syndrome where people think that if they watch films like this then they are magically George Bailey and not Mr. Potter.  I also wish that they could have hit a little harder on the idea of why Nappy Cuts needed all of the flashy gimmicks. I would say that corporations use things like basketball courts inside a hair cut place because they know that they can never emulate the sincere community feeling that you get by going to a small business. And they also know that when it comes down to money or community the people will always pick money. Oh well. This film is pretty much a commercial version of the HBO film ""Everyday People."" It's no better or no worse, just different. ***1/4",1112054400,3,2175,4.565552699228792
2023753,3,B0001Q4BOE,"I do not mean to imply that I was surprised at how well this sequel came off. Generally sequals pale in comparison to the original and just as generally, the public expects less.

Hats off to the sequel to Barbershop which I found to be quite pleasing and enjoyable. The sequel is not ambitious and plot-wise is rather formulaic. What makes this work however, is the history, both of the characters as well as of African-Americans, that is seamlessly woven into the story to flesh out the characters and give the viewer a chance to understand the motivations behind their actions.

A very interesting example is the way Isaac, the only white barber, is treated in the sequel. I submit that Ice-Cube is trying to give the audience a glimpse of what it must be like to be the minority in a given work situation. Instead of not balancing the opinion by only showing the effects this would have on a minority, he made a white man the minority and showed how exasperating and ultimately demeaning this kind of behavior can have on the oppressor as well as the one being oppressed.

There were good jokes all around but somehow I found myself less interested in the laughs and more interested in the presentation of the message. Some may feel it descended into schmaltz, i.e., let's live together in peace, love and respect for the differences of your fellow man, etc. Conceding that these messages tend to be sentimental, when we look at what is happening today, this is infinitely more important a message than reinforcing the same old sterotypes.

It is also wonderful to see the incomparable (and fine!) Harry J. Lennix. Even though he played the protagonist, he nonetheless elevated the production with his sterling portrayal of the businessman whose main concern is making money at the expense of the rich historic tradition of the neighbborhood.

Worthy outing indeed!",1111536000,,1869,4.809968847352025

This movie provides a look at the past and how Eddy (Cedric) came to work at the shop and the love of his life.  Frankly, I can do without the secondary story.  I also get no thrill from Queen Latifah's role in the beauty shop next door.  Her role only serves to promote the upcoming movie, Beauty Shop.  Still, this is a pleasant enough film to watch when you're in the mood.  For those who are starved for black comedy entertainment, here it is.",1111017600,,588,4.37037037037037

It's basically the same choice: Do I sell out and take the money or do I stick with the neighborhood.  Guess which decision he makes.

It does has some funny moments, but they are mixed in with several plot lines that don't really relate to the movie - a love-hate romance with two of the younger barbers, Cedric the Entertainer reminiscing about his past (We never did find out why his girl left) and the white guy barber's pompous attitude.

Overall, I finished watching that movie and thought.  Hm. I really could have found something better to do for 2 hours.",1110499200,6,720,4.37593984962406

And his fathers relationship with Cedric's role.  One such thing is you find out how Cedric got hired and you find out he had a love!  You also see how competition gets in the way of the Barbershop.  This show introduced us to Queen and her upcoming role in The Beautyshop.

Over-all this movie is good because it held its ground compared to most sequels.  I also like the fact that it is still clean movie.  I recommend seeing this movie if you liked the first one.",1108252800,3,643,4.3

the funniest parts actually came from kenan thompson (from kenan and kel on nickelodeon and SNL) he was mad funny....  AND queen latifah.  the only part in the movie i was looking forward to was the bar-b-que when queen latifah and cedric the entertainer's characters . they could have ranaway with that scene and made the movie a classic but that scene was way weak...

2023759,4,B0001Q4BOE,"I really didn't care too much about seeing the sequel but I went ahead and watched it anyhow. The second part makes the first seems simple and weak. It is probably one of the few movies in which no doubt the character development has matured but in which the sequel has far outdid the first part. Here in this movie, the conflicts centers around the ever changing problems that has plagued cities over the last decade--urban renewal. Not only are the characters are dealing with big companies posing as afro-sheeps but their very own enemies with a lot of cash at hand like nappycuts.com ,the website used in the movie, ready to undo what the owner and workers of the barbershop has been doing for a long time in just weeks what took them years to perfect and gain respect for. The movie is far from being passe and weak compared to the first one. It has some dark humor, historical memories and nostalgia that made the movie come off stronger and more powerful than the first one. I liked this movie a lot, it was really a movie. I sat there and watched it and it surprised me, showing me something new instead of being very predictable and trite. I recommend seeing this movie",1099526400,,1178,4.4837209302325585

2023761,3,B0001Q4BOE,"""Barbershop 2: Back in Business"" isn't quite as funny as the first ""Barbershop,"" but it still has that same freeform looseness that made the original such a crossover hit.  As with the earlier film, ""Back in Business"" is little more than a string of conversations held together by the barest minimum of a storyline.  Calvin's shop is a neighborhood institution steeped in tradition, with a long and honorable history of providing conversation and companionship along with its services.  In this installment, the shop faces a threat from a posh new haircutting franchise that is opening up across the street as part of a local redevelopment plan.  It's a classic case of David vs. Goliath, with Calvin (Ice Cube) and his cohorts taking on the two-headed giant of corrupt politicians and corporate greed.

The plot is always the least of the matters in the ""Barbershop"" films; what counts is the playful interaction amongst the various characters, as well as the shrewd, sharp-eyed and often acerbic observations made by the resident jokester, Eddie, marvelously played by Cedric the Entertainer.  Eddie is not afraid to take on any number of ""sacred cows"" in the black community even if it means offending certain members of the audience. The only complaint I have about Cedric is that he mumbles so much that it is often hard to understand what it is he`s saying.  Still, the scene in which he goes toe-to-toe and mano-a-mano with Queen Latifah is alone worth the price of admission.  As Calvin, Ice Cube once again provides the solid center of sanity and rationality around which all the craziness can swirl.

The material isn't as fresh the second time around, but ""Barbershop 2"" provides a few good laughs, some decent sentiment and a chance to spend some additional time with a group of characters who know how to have a little fun with life even when life itself doesn`t always make that so easy to do.",1096156800,,1907,4.861111111111111
2023762,3,B0001Q4BOE,The original had much more edge to it.  The characters in part 2 seemed to be holding back.  I enjoyed the banter in the female salon much more than the male barbershop.  The movie should have exploited a truism - that most men prefer a spartan barbershop to a salon anyday.  It's the last place on earth where they can feel like men.

2023763,3,B0001Q4BOE,First off I'm not the kind of person who goes see a new movie and says it's either better then the first or the best movie I've ever seen.  But in this case Barber Shop 2 is better then the first in many ways but the first one wasn't all that great so that might not mean so much.  The movie is about there Barbershop competing with someone elses hair cut place that over exceeds theres.  The movie has the same people in the Barbershop but are missing some people from the first like the people stealing the ATM machine.  If you liked the first you'll love this but if you didn't like the first this isn't going to change your mind.  There's also more slightly cruder humor in this one so they actually swear at some points and say some dirty jokes unlike the first.  This is though still a great family video.

2023767,4,B0001Q4BOE,"I really enjoyed this sequel. It may not have had the originality that the first one had, but it took the characters from the original and expanded their roles and history. The characters were believable and none went over to the realm of the stock, stereotypical black character seen in most black-themed films.

 Again, the stand out performances are made by Cedric the Entertainer's Eddie and Ice Cube's Calvin. Where Eddie is the comedy and conscience of the film, Cube's Calvin is the soul and center of the film. It is hard to believe that this is the same person who started the ""gangsta rap"" trend of the early 90's and also starred mostly in roles as a gang-member. Cube has shown that he can take a serious role and make it his own.

 The end of the film came too soon. I wanted to see more about these characters and see how the rest of their lives unfolded. But with the success of this sequel, a third one is sure to be greenlighted. These are characters that I got attached to and wouldn't mind visiting once more for a trifecta.",1091404800,3,1043,4.445026178010472
2023768,3,B0001Q4BOE,"This movie is one of those reasons why every successful movie doesn't have to have a sequel.  It's almost a given nowadays that a movie will have a sequel if it makes money.  Barbershop 2 is mediocre.  The story is weak and the moral decision making of Ice Cube was played on in the last film, so in a way it's a remake of the first, just rearranged a bit.  The one saving grace of this movie is Queen Latifa.  Every show and movie she's in seems to shine from her presence.  I could've done without the white guy trying to act like a black guy.  That kinda thing just annoys me more than anything.  I would've still watched the film regardless of the white guy (I'm caucasian) because I find some black comedies funny.  I suggest watching the Friday sequels instead of this.",1091318400,3,775,4.326388888888889
2023769,3,B0001Q4BOE,"As sequels usually go, it's not exactly brave in the tack it takes, but does maintain a general rhythm.

The theme itself summarizes the quality of the entire film. A competing company run by suits is opening a clip-shop across the street with bikini-clad damsels doing the hair cutting. Hmm.

Cedric the owner is clearly the focal point here but he slurs his lines pretty badly, or it was perhaps the accent, that I had a tough time keeping up with all the supposed humor.  What I did understand had little to do with the politically charged wit in the first film, and more to do with ad hominem takes on celebrities.

Well paced but hackneyed, just doesn't have the riotous antics as its prequel. Perhaps a decent rental to have as a backdrop for an evening with friends.",1090540800,3,773,4.539568345323741
2023770,2,B0001Q4BOE,"Nothing special about this movie.  Maybe this is the cutting room material removed from the floor during Barbershop 1.  The new high-tech spa style barbershop storyline wasn't that great.  I was more interested in old man Eddie's flashbacks and a woman from his past.  When Eddie finally ran into the mystery woman after 30 or 40 yrs later at the subway/train/loop, the directors didn't take the story any further.

The only good character is really Cedric, and they show alot of him through flashbacks(just like Memento). As for the others, they aren't anything special. I didn't laugh at any of the commercials and this movie didn't make me laugh once. The only real saving grace is that they did not choose annoying actors for the lead rolls.
I would call this movie a cash-in, but that's not what this is. This movie is simply not well done, and isn't funny.",1088985600,,557,4.58

Cedric the entertainer is hilarious in this movies and ice cube is a good owner of the famous barbershop. Queen Latifah does a good job in her special apperance as Calvins Ex. The movie plot is that a new high tech barber shop / salon is moving in next to the barbershop trying to run it out of business. In the area of chicago big businesses are buying out all of the small home owned stores and all the fellow shop pwners want calvin to sell his shop so they can try to get more money out of the deal. the city is voting on a law to keep big corporations out of the city. will it pasS? will the barbershop get run out of business? i know the plot doesnt sound great and not very original but it isn't always the plot that counts this is a great comedy for the jokes not always the plot.

2023773,4,B0001Q4BOE,"As much as I loved the original I must say, the sequel is better.  In the first one, the comedy was so off the top the characters became almost became cartoon like.  I liked the fact that the director got a chance to actually expand the depth of the characters (Eddie, Calvin, Terry, Yinka, Ricky, and Jimmy) and give the audience a chance to see their actual personal lives away from the barbershop so to speak.  It's usually hard to do that when you have so many characters jumbled up into one movie, but Kevin Rodney Sullivan was able to pull it off with the sequel.  Showing the secret behind Eddie's love of the barbershop and why he and Calvin's father were so close gave me a better understanding of his character and why he is so outspoken with his young counterparts.  Seeing Ricky's character put aside all the street b.s. to try and better himself and get his G.E.D. was a plus, and I felt him when he said once he got it, he really doesn't know what it all means.  We've all been there at that age.  Eventhough near the end of the movie when Calvin was offered the $200,000 to convince folks to sell the properties and accept change, it shows in our ""bling bling"" materialistic & capitalistic society, a thing such as principal, and the right thing to do does still exist, even if it's only on the big screen.  And of course, adding the Queen (Love That Big Block) never hurts either.  She is truly a talent.",1088640000,,1420,4.3893129770992365

2023775,4,B0001Q4BOE,"""Barbershop 2: Back in Business"" (2004)
This is a great movie, even funnier than the first at times. Kenan Thompson's role as Calvin's cousin was HILARIOUS (check him out on ""Saturday Night Live""). We get to learn more about the characters, especially Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer). His jokes are less cruel than in the first movie, but he is still the show-stealer. We also learn how he got his start in the barbershop and even how he fell in love with his wife (Garcelle Beauvais).
What I don't understand, though, was Gina's (Queen Latifah) role in this film. Yeah, she used to date Calvin and her ribbing face-off with Eddie was funny, but she's not essential to the story. In fact, if you were to remove her and her beauty shop from the script, the story would still flow perfectly well. It seems as though the writers put Latifah in the script  to reassure the fans that this movie won't be another disappointing sequel. (Another reason may be to push her spinoff film, ""Beauty Salon"".)
If you see this movie before the first Barbershop, you may be a little disappointed because this movie is character-driven (whereas the first one was plot-driven); so much of the characters' actions are based on what happened in the last movie (i.e., the communication between Ricky, Terri and Dinka). This makes it a good reason to see both movies. You'll love them. -EJR",1079395200,5,1366,4.739495798319328
2023776,4,B0001Q4BOE,"This is a worthy sequal, full of the laughs, humor, and emotion of the original.  However it still lacks in other areas, such as a poor, sudden, conclusion; and a slow start.
The storyline of this movie is fairly close to that of the original.  One of the last mainstays of Americana, the corner barbershop, is being threatened by big developers who want to put a chain store across the street.  Barbershop 2, however, is less about the story and more about the characters.  And the characters are truly larger then life.  You will fall in love with each of them and their idiosyncracies.  They all return from the original, and that's the main reason this move gets an above average review.
It started slow but quickly picked up steam.  I was suprised by the sudden ending, however, and would have preferred that it continue for at least another ten minutes.  Overall, though, a good movie well worth seeing.",1078272000,2,909,4.672955974842767
2023777,4,B0001Q4BOE,"Barbershop 2: Back in Business is a great sequel, one which delivers fresh, subversive laughs.  Sure the plot is just about the same as the first, but the movie still entertains and the cast is even better since we have a few new characters, such
as Queen Latifah who plays Gina, the owner of another barbershop
near Calvin's.
  Ice Cube returns as Calvin Palmer, the owner of a very popular barbershop on the Chicago Southside.  The entire cast does return, and offers something a little new to the film, surely Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) for in this film he rambles about the Kobe Bryant trial, R. Kelly and Michael Jackson as well as a few others.  Eve returns as Teri, Sean Patrick Thomas, Michael Ealy, Troy Garity and more.  I should also point out that this installment is directed by a different director, Kevin Rodney Sullivan who made his debut with this film and he keeps the franchise going more than well.
  Barbershop 2: Back In Business is rated PG-13 for Language, Sexual Material and Brief Drug References.  The language is a bit bawdy and rough, there's also sexual innuendo nothing explicit though.  The film has already been a hit and surely deserves to be one, I'm not too sure if it's better than the first but it sure is as good.
