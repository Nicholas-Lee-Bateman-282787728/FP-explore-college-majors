8459953,4,B0056XFY1Q,"This is one of those rare films that would definitely never be made in this day and age (with the phony so-called ""war on terror"" and all that going on!), but it was even out of place when compared to the type of stuff that was being made when it was first released. In ""Nanou"" (from 1986), we have your basic story of ""girl meets boy"" set against the beautiful and scenic French countryside, and with a subplot involving young ""idealists"" who are members/sympathizers of a terrorist cell/operation. When 'Nanou' (played by the absolutely fantastic---Imogen Stubbs), goes to France on a work/study holiday, while on the train and by sheer chance, she meets 'Luc' (Jean-Philippe &Eacute;coffey), a disillusioned young-man. At first their relationship appears platonic, but they soon embark on a whirlwind romance that will change and mark their lives forever.

Why is this a good and exceptional film? Because, first and foremost---it has one of my favorite actors of all-time in---Imogen Stubbs (she and Juliet Stevenson are easily my two favorite female British actors). She radiates such a serene and tranquil image in her interpretation of a young woman going through a ""rites of passage"" of sorts, that it was sheer magic just to watch her work her craft. Jean-Philippe &Eacute;coffey was also very good as the troubled 'Luc', and the iconic Lou Castel and a young Daniel Day-Lewis both had small roles. The cinematography was also quite good (in that artistic European vein, which I love), and the musical score was also very nice without it being overly sentimental. This is the kind of film that only true ""cinephiles"" could appreciate---the action is slow-going in places, which lets the story unfold and develop properly in due time. What I got out of the story, or how I would interpret it anyway---'Nanou' is like a symbolic representation of the ""female principle"" of Nature: imagination, creativity, fertility, memory, compassion, etc. Thus, in this respect she is the ""wise one"" (like the oracle of old), who intuitively knows better and serves as the polar contrast to the rest of the well-intentioned but misguided men within her midst. I don't know if that was the filmmaker's vision too (Conny Templeman), but sometimes one gets different things from what was originally intended or envisioned by the artists themselves. After all, true Art is always encompassing a much deeper objective from what it usually appears or seems to be, to the casual observer. And, on this point in particular, Imogen Stubbs truly looked like an embodiment of a ""nature spirit"" herself. She is such a gifted soul. This is one of those obscure films that one can enjoy and admire for its unique qualities and sensibilities and in staying true to an aesthetic principle.

The film was directed by the aforementioned Conny Templeman and it was a British and French co-production. I first saw it in what now seems like such a long time ago and, I'm glad I got the chance to see it again.

The only available DVD release is by Prism (from 2004), and this seems to be out of print too. And, the Prism DVD is in dubbed Italian unfortunately. The picture and sound quality is quite good but not great either. So, let's hope they do this film justice and release it in its original English and French language and give it a full restoration too . PAL format, Italian (dubbed), some French (Italian subtitles), FFN, NR 101 mins. (BTW: I bought the DVD through Amazon.it for 14.89 euros.)

Love and Peace,
