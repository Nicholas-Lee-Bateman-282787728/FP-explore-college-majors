7685122,5,B01CO70L0U,I just love Father Matteo's gentle humor and compassion and the fact that he's so non-judgmental of the people he's talking to about God. He is the perfect archetype of Jesus.,1479513600,3,175,4.67741935483871

7685126,5,B01CO70L0U,"great entrtainment!...can't tell you how manyt imes we have watched the whole series and waiting anxiously for the next sets to come out - great drama; great teachings; great for people of all faiths but most especially Catholics and Ortodox Christians because of the many Bible verses and the Holy Mass, Confession etc....
every single night after dinner and sfter shower when they are ready to go to bed, they say their prayers and then beg for one more episode of Don Matteo, and since we love it too, we can't refuse and therefore, every night we watch Don MAtteo again and again - it is highly entertaining and it is good for families, especially families with different struggles and problems - try it, you won't regret it....
oh we just can't wait for #16, #17 etc......please get them out real soon....thanks",1462665600,9,816,4.753521126760563
8753505,4,B01CO70L0U,"Discovered this by accident at the library and was delighted to find a classic TV cozy mystery. Funny, wholesome, & entertaining. Imagine Murder She Wrote set in an Italian village and instead of Jessica you have a kind, good-natured priest who's the sleuth. The mysteries are nicely done, there are lots of laughs and sentimental moments, and the scenery's lovely. Only two caveats. If you don't like subtitles, it's not for you; in Italian. And the DVDs that I've seen are letterbox, meaning black bars all around the picture. Nonetheless, if you like cozy mysteries, you're sure to like Don Matteo.",1520899200,,601,4.96039603960396

8753508,5,B01CO70L0U,"Love the series! Always with a good message at the end.
Even though the main character is a priest, there is no bias towards the Catholic church.
Instead there are many messages of peace and friendship.
A great series with great actors!",1498867200,4,236,4.642857142857143
8753509,5,B01CO70L0U,"My husband and I LOVE Don Matteo.  It no longer comes on our TV so we buy the DVDs.  Is there a #16 and #17 and if so when in the world will  they be released.  This is entertainment for a family.  It has humor and grace and dignity and I am ready to see 16 and 17.  So whoever is making the decisions, please print the DVDs (in a format for American TV).",1493424000,11,355,3.72972972972973
