7903328,5,6304165021,I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Mother kept me interested from the start to the end. The acting from the lead character was really believable. I enjoyed this one and recommend it.,1388620800,,189,4.757575757575758
7903329,1,6304165021,"Maybe I was expecting too much from this video, however, I found it to be basic in the extreme.  I'm a novice and don't really understand the more subtle points of lighting and composition and this video did almost nothing  to change that.",955238400,4,239,4.534883720930233
7903330,3,6304165021,"I was very disappointed that this video is only 30 minutes long if that.  Although it gave some very basic guidelines, it certainly didn't address much more than taking pictures under perfect conditions like a bright but  clouded (no shadows) day.  Gave a few tips but not many.  Not worth the  money.  Only good thing about paying this much money for so little is the  profits go to a non-profit organization.",951609600,4,410,4.690140845070423
