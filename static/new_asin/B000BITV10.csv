2419214,5,B000BITV10,It is fantastic news that this series has now been issued on DVD.  Any info on when it will be available in the U.K.  HOPE IT'S SOON !!,1129852800,,135,3.7857142857142856
2419215,5,B000BITV10,The long wait is over. This program had such potential I was shocked when it was pulled. The characters were just great. The actors meshed perfectly. I have to agree with a previous reviewer that this television program left all of the movie sequels to the original in the dust. This was a great program with a fine cast.,1128988800,37,321,4.4576271186440675
2419216,5,B000BITV10,"AT long long last! One of my favourite and much mourned TV shows. Stellar cast, great stories, fantastic cinematography. I simply can not wait to buy this. I hope they intend to release all the episodes!!",1128988800,,204,4.694444444444445
2419217,5,B000BITV10,"I enjoyed this series when it was originally on and was disapointed when it didn't come back.  Then I found the massive following of fan fic generated by the show and really fell in love with the boys!  Hallmark gave us a little taste though they commited sacrilege by chopping scenes out for commercials, but Showtime, God bless them, showed them to us starting back in the winter commercial free and whole.

As I watched the episodes on showtime, I really began to see what a good show this was!  The people who pulled this and ruined it by moving it around so much really had no idea what they had!  I mean, almost all shows start out a little rough, but this one was starting to really get going when they pulled the plug.  It had great characters who really fit together well, great storylines, and so many possibilities!

There's a character for each of us--the hardened, battle-scarred and world-weary gun slinger, the charming, roguish ladies man and loyal friend, the quiet tracker and outdoorsman, the gun toting, whiskey drinking man of the cloth who lost his way but may have found it again in this town, the ex-slave who chose to care instead of hate and used his talents to help all, the idealist greenhorn who comes west hoping to make a name for himself and in the process finds friendship and brotherhood that will teach him to be a better man (and hopefully keep him from getting himself killed before he sees another birthday), and finally, last but certainly not least, the consumate southern gentlemen conman gambler (who maybe isn't really all that gentlemanly afterall, but makes up for it by being greatly charming and roguish in his own right!) who may have found a worthy purpose and a chance at a new life in this town.  They all have their faults, their weaknesses, and their shortcomings, but that is what makes them so appealing--they're human beings, and we can relate to them.  And they have a brotherhood and friendship that most of us want.  And they're men, which in this day and age, is really getting harder to find....And they are just plain fun!  Who else gets to use a cannon to blow up the enemy's flag or a store front or a slingshot to sling dynamite at the bad guys?  Not to mention that it's the old west, so carrying fires arms and using them isn't a problem, especially when you have a gritty old warhorse of a boss like Judge Travis (who, for those interested in the movies, starred as the gambler in the first one).  This was really a great show!  But at least, now I can enjoy the show on DVD and further the adventures through the fanfic forums.

Note: as if you couldn't tell already, I personally loved this show and thought it buried the movies in it's dust.  If you're looking for something like the movies, this isn't it, but watch this anyway--if you like westerns (or if you don't) you'll like this!",1128816000,66,2857,4.539961013645224

I agree with all the information the previous reviewer supplied, and I too hope that the site is corrected soon. I did send an email directly to Amazon concerning the misinformation, so hopefully it reaches the right person to get things fixed. I would love to pre-order the set, but not until everything is corrected, so I know for certain I am going to be sent the right item.

2419274,5,B000BITV10,"I love this series.  It is a balanced ensemble cast that mirrors some of the characters from the US movie version.  There is the young rookie gunfighter, the itinerant gambler, and Chris Larabie. There is a spiritual shaman and a self taught medical man that did not go to a medical school.  And there are tow other gunfighter characters of differing character.  What I really loved was the Elmer Bernstein music from the original US move that was used.  I would watch the entire opening and ending credits, just to experience the music.  I am a fan of Michael Biehn and Ron Perlman.

My wife who is not a fan of Westerns usually also really likes The Magnificent Seven. The story lines are great and all cast members do a great job in their respective roles. We liked Series 1 so much that we immediately ordered Series 2 and are enjoying watching it at the moment.

2419301,5,B000BITV10,"LIKE MANY other reviews here, I only 'dicovered' the series years after it had aired, and I cannot believe the quality of it.  I am writing this in 2011, over twelve years after the series aired and in my opinion it is better than anything currently on television TODAY.
  Just the fact that somehow the show creators did not date themselves (minus the first episode) is a true achievement let alone getting everything else right.  Writing, filming, acting, sets, characters, action, fun-factor are all perfected here, it was a shame the show was cancelled and I wish I had found the show earlier to provide my own support. . . as if it would have mattered with totally inept TV broadcasters who put commercial short term gain over quality every time.
  To be honest, I did not like the first episode very much (pilot episodes tend to be a little rough for any series when they are first starting).  But from episode 2 to the end, it is jaw-dropping amazing so you really could just jump in and start watching from episode 2.  The rest of the series is so astoundingly good I can forgive the pilot.
  At least we did get many wonderful shows before it was cancelled so I recommend this highly and hope there is a future remastered hi-def version to come.",1299628800,,1254,4.533333333333333

While the DVDS were not of the sharpest quality, I had already learned about this from another reviewer and so, was not surprised. Aside from that, everything exceeded expectations!",1295308800,,345,4.9655172413793105
2419303,4,B000BITV10,"This Western television series based on the Hollywood film of the same name, was one of the few programmes during the late 1990's that really had so much going for it; good looking actors, great stories and thrilling gunfights, it really is a shame it only lasted two short seasons. It is a premise that sets seven men from different, and some questionable backgrounds, joining together to save and protect a small town and its citizens from the villains of the day. Although set back in the late 1800's, the stories also have a certain modern appeal.  Following the seven leads, played by some very fine film and television actors, including Michael Biehn, Ron Perlman and Eric Close, is certainly a huge part of the charm. They lend an amazing amount of drama and humour to some very creatively written stories. When these first aired, I personally felt it was a refreshing change from the grinding cop shows and simple-minded comedies available at the time.  I highly recommend this for anyone, however, I had to give this 9 episode (including the pilot), 2-disc set, only 4 out of 5 stars because it lacks something all fans of the DVD experience demands and hungers for, and that is extras, extras, extras. There are absolutely no behind-the-scenes footage, photos, or interviews with cast or crew, which would have been a great bonus.",1237593600,,1340,4.821739130434783

This is basically what happens in every episode of ""The Magnificent Seven"", but that doesn't mean that it's not a lot of fun.

This is the family-friendly, sanitized for television version of the west, everyone bathes and the good people behave the way they should have behaved. The first season is a lot of fun. It's pure action, with just the right amount of comic relief. Unfortunately, in the second season, the writers introduced a lot of psychological issues, which spoiled the fun, but you don't have to bother with those. Just stick with the first season.

This boxed set comprises the nine episodes of season one (including the movie-length pilot episode), packaged in slim-line cases. There are no special features included on the DVDs.",1206144000,3,911,4.870967741935484

2419368,5,B000BITV10,"This was a very entertaining television series that, unfortunately, ended far too soon.

As a lover of westerns - books, movies or television shows - I really enjoyed this series when it originally aired back in the late 90's as I knew back then it would be lucky to last 1 or 2 complete seasons. Today, of course, it wouldn't last more than 1 / 2 dozen episodes (could you imagine this show trying to compete with the plethora of mindless ""reality"" shows that pollute the airways night after night..??!!)

Week after week, the viewer was treated to a  very well written episode and starring an interesting and diverse assortment of characters, who comprised the Magnificent Seven.
In this television series, the 7 are based in a town - without a sheriff / marshall. The seven act as the local law and periodically, Robert Vaughan appears as a judge who dispenses frontier justice to the outlawas who are actually left standing after the gunbattles (not too many).

Although the seven acted as a unit, they were all very different in character and usually there were two or three different story lines going on in each episode. Each week, we seemed to liearn a little more about each man's backgrounhd.

The recurring theme revolved around Chris Larabee (the Yul Brynner character) who lost his wife and son to violence many years earlier. Darkly played by Michael Biehn, the man / men who did the killing are now dead, however, Chris is continually hunting for the man who ordered the killing.

In addition to Chris, who never seemed to have alot of dialogue, we also had Josiah, who, when we wasn't blasting bad guys to Kingdom Come served as the town's preacher complete with his own church. We also had a fancy vest-wearing gambler, a black guy who served as a doctor occasionally and a few others who had some interesting backgrounds.

It's unfortunate that the show only last a couple of seasons - this is a show I could have watched year after year. But westerns in the 90's have about as much a chance of survival as a snowball in hell.

It's too bad that westerns aren't terribly popular anymore - you can still tell a great story that revolves around some interesting characters and put it in the 1880's west.

But I guess in this day and age, you would have countless psychologists and ""child experts"" bemoaning the fact that we're cultivating a generation of violent children by exposing them to too much gunfire and violence each week.

Funny how this never happened to the generation of kids who grew up on Bonanza and Gunsmoke and countless other great westerns of the late 50's / early 60's.",1171152000,11,2607,4.672489082969432

The only disappointment was that there were ONLY 9 episodes. If there was a second season, I sure hope they make it available soon. Thumbs up all the way!",1146528000,7,282,4.035714285714286

2419424,5,B000BITV10,I still cannot believe this show was cancelled.  I happened to pop into a website that was dedicated to the show and saw the episodes were out.  I love Amazon for having this!!  Thank you all.,1141776000,7,192,4.277777777777778
2419425,5,B000BITV10,"This is a quality series.  The actors are all superb, the stories are gripping, the writing is excellent.  Everything about the Magnificent Seven is excellent - the lighting which creates the mood of each episode - night or day; the support actors who lend realism to the stories; the horses, the food, the drink, the good and the bad of any town.  The viewer feels that they are in a small town near the Mexican border in the 1870s.  The seven Magnificos work well together when called upon, but their individuality is shown in each episode.  We learn more about them each time - and, they are shown to have flaws as well as assets.  As one of them said in the pilot episode, they are the first kind of heroes: ""There are those who confront danger head-on and pretend to not fear death.""

Fans of the series petitioned - and fought - for another season of Mag7 after its first season.  This is very good television.  The series should not have been cancelled after two seasons.  Its appeal is obvious by all the websites, fanfic, and fan sites that have remained and even grown stronger and greater in number as time goes by.",1141344000,7,1126,4.4754901960784315
2419426,3,B000BITV10,"Had much the same reaction to this as I did to ALL the movie sequels: the very obvious one of 'Okay, but not a patch on the original.'  (And not to even consider 'The Seven Samurai').

On the other hand if you'd been living in a cave for the last forty years and had no landmark original to compare it with, the series would be pretty good. Worth a look,anyway: well shot etc. The 4:3 was a bit disappointing; wasn't this made in the widescreen era?).

Certainly the characters have been given their little quirks but, again comparing the series to the original movie, nobody has the killer edge...it's the pretend violence of little boys playing cowboys.

In fact, these blokes look like they've been rounded up around the studio and the director has said 'Right: this week we're doing a western.'

Verdict: fine for a wet Sunday afternoon. Far better to get yourself the new 2-disc version of the original movie. Now THAT's worth the time and money, in spades.",1141084800,3,962,4.60233918128655
2419427,5,B000BITV10,"I was so happy that they brought this superb western to DVD.  The only thing it is missing is comments and trailors from the actors themselves.  Hopefully, when they bring out Season 2 on DVD, that oversight will be corrected.",1140134400,8,226,4.625
2419428,5,B000BITV10,"I am a avid fan of Westerns and have been watching them since I was a young boy. This series is one of the best I have seen the plots are fantastic and its a great pity that there was no season 2. I have seen all the magnificent movies and other than the original Magnificent Seven and its sequel Return of the Seven the rest are crap but watchable,this series however is superb and the legend is kept alive and the actors really gel very well with one another. I cant see any reason as to why this was taken of the air after just one season, could it be politics in the network? I was in the US sometime back and I remember seeing one its episodes on showtime but the DVD did not contain this particular episode what happened to it. Is there going to be another release of the remaining episodes pray tell.",1139702400,6,807,4.146496815286624
2419429,5,B000BITV10,"I was one of the lucky few who taped the show when it came to CBS, but over time the tapes were destroyed. I was thrilled when they finally decided to put the show out on DVD and I can't wait until season 2 hits the shelves! This show had such potential and an awesome list of characters that was sadly pulled when ratings dropped...if I remember correctly, constant preemptions didn't help. If you're a fan of westerns of the classic type, this would be a great addition to your library!",1138665600,4,488,4.373626373626373
2419430,4,B000BITV10,"For fans of the wild west genre, this DVD is full of the traditional cowboy heroes making good in a small township. It would be nice if there was more character depth but given the show's format and current trends in tv series, this is a great collage of a much maligned genre. A must for anyone who likes good old fashioned entertainment in its purest form.",1138492800,4,358,4.358208955223881
2419431,5,B000BITV10,"Finally the waiting is over. I loved the Magnificent Seven series. Unfortunatley here in Germany, the whole series was only on for one time. Now to get the First Season on DVD and with the originial sound is just to good to be true",1138492800,3,231,4.2727272727272725
2419432,5,B000BITV10,"Having loved the original Magnificent Seven movie when I was growing up, I was curious to find that it had been made into a tv-series. Living in Australia we never got to see this show, but based on all the good reviews it was receiving on Amazon and the fact that it was only around $20, I thought I would risk it and buy a copy (I took a similar risk with Firefly and Waterfalls, buying them never having seen an episode, and ended up enjoying both of them, so I figured I was on a roll :-)

Well it was well worth the purchase! All the actors are great and have been perfectly cast into their roles. I loved the mix of humour, tension and action. I found that I ended up watching at least 2 or 3 episodes per sitting to see how the longer story arcs (which I won't give away) would progress. Each of the characters have been created as 3 dimensional people, with strengths and weaknesses. No one is all good or all bad (except maybe the ""baddies"" :-) Actually the show reminds me of another great tv-series western - Young Riders, only with adults instead of teenagers.

The only disappointing aspect of the box set is that there are no extras, however can't complain too much, since they did keep the price low.

I can't believe that they axed such a promising show, although from other reviewers' comments it looks like there was at least a season 2? Can't wait to buy it as well :-)

Anyway, if you are a fan of westerns (or even shows like Firefly which I guess is a sci-fi western), then you might want to give this one a go.",1137542400,16,1533,4.239726027397261
2419433,5,B000BITV10,"I just got my DVD set today and while I'm thrilled and happy to have it, I'm also just a little disappointed at the lack of special features. I think the loyal fans deserved better.

However, that said, I'm a happy camper being able to watch quality versions of the episodes as my taped-off-tv videos were getting grainy from so much use. I think the shows are a fun and exciting example of the genre and a worthy addition to any Western fan's collection. How sad this show was never given the chance to develop into what it could have been!

Sony Pictures...PLEASE! Season 2 ASAP!",1136505600,6,581,4.471698113207547
2419454,4,B000BITV10,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Magnificent Seven series when it first aired in 1998.  The first season, in my opinion, held the best episodes.  The cast definately defined magnificence, and they really interacted well with each other.  Some of the episodes were great, some of the plots were a bit cheesy and unbelievable.  [hence i feel that the show is overrated though delightful.]  It definately was worth watching, you will be fond of the actors, but it is not the best tv show ever by a long shot.  I think the classics such as rawhide, big valley, high chaparral should not be overlooked!",1136419200,2,589,4.7254901960784315
2419455,5,B000BITV10,"I have waited a long time for this series to be put on DVD.  The story lines, the actors, the set, the costumes, etc were extrodinary.  While the series chose to over-look the darker aspects of prostitution and race relations in the old west, it gave the viewer an enjoyable look into how things should have been back then and should be today.

I think the set could have contained at least some behind the scenes material and actor interviews.  The loyal fans of The Magnificent Seven would have enjoyed those extras.  I hope when they release the last episodes they include the extras that the loyal fans would love to see.",1134432000,5,625,4.544642857142857
2419456,5,B000BITV10,"I loved this series when it was on and it could have been a hit. Unfortunately the network programmers never gave it a chance about every other week they would move it to a different day and time or pre-empt it and you really had to search the tv guide to find it. The cast is amazing that they assembled and each character distinct. The actors really got into their characters and the different personalties dovetailed perfectly. The show was very well produced and written. I was soooo excited when I heard they were finally going to release the first 10 episodes that as soon as it was available for pre-order I ordered it. I've watched the dvds and there are no extras or anything on these dvds, but it is ok due to the fact the shows are complete and still brillant! Now I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the other 10 episodes to be released! This dvd alone has made my Holiday Season bright anything else I may receive will be icing on the cake!",1134000000,5,952,4.3841807909604515
2419457,5,B000BITV10,"A well-made television western, sure to appeal to fans of the genre.  A fine collection of actors, a great set, well-written episodes, characters with depth that evolved over the course of the series, humor and wit rolled into an outstanding show that CBS (in my opinion) never really fully appreciated.

I'm glad to see it make the jump to DVD, and hope that folks who may not have seen the series will give it a try - you won't be disappointed!",1133913600,3,446,4.493827160493828
2419458,4,B000BITV10,"""The Magnificent Seven"" is one of the best Western TV shows ever and does credit to the genre. Anyone who likes Westerns would *love* this show! ... And since the genre is plagued with anachronisms, has been since its conception and will never be rid of them all, the point of it not being how the West really was won, but rather how present day Americans romanticize it and why, I completely forgive Mag7 theirs.

I give this item 4 stars only because I think the DVD could have been better. The screen format of the DVD being available only in 1.33:1 is annoying. I wish it were also available in wide screen format. The French subtitles could also be translated better... It doesn't really preserve the flavor of the English dialects the show uses, using much fancier synonyms when simpler language would have been closer to what the characters said in English. The DVD also has no ""special features"" except an ad for other western DVDs. But the image quality is excellent and it looks really good on my HDTV, and the packaging is also very pretty.

My only question at this point is, when will Season 2 be released?",1133913600,,1119,4.562189054726368
2419459,5,B000BITV10,"I was not able to catch this wonderful series during its too short run on CBS, however, I did see it in reruns and was very impressed (impressed enough to catch every episode on VHS ;-)).  If you only listed a few of the stars this series had in its regular cast you would find talent such as:

-  <a href=""[...]"">Eric Close</a> (Without a Trace, Taken, Now & Again, Saving Angelo)

-  <a href=""[...]"">Ron Perlman</a> (Hellboy 1 & 2, Gun [VG voice], Alien: Resurrection)

-  <a href=""[...]"">Michael Biehn</a> (Terminator, The Art of War, The Rock, K2)

-  <a href=""[...]"">Anthony Starke</a> (Prison Break, Crossing Jordan, Charmed, CSI)

And when you add in guest stars that included:

-  <a href=""[...]"">Robert Vaughn</a> (Who played Lee in The Magnificent Seven [1960])

-  <a href=""[...]"">Michelle Phillips</a>

-  <a href=""[...]"">Tyne Daly</a>.

This was a great series that was canceled way to quickly by CBS who no longer wanted to have a ""cowboy"" genre on Saturday nights (ie Dr. Quinn, M7, Chuck Noris). They still haven't recovered from that mistake. For those of you who like the movies, you will love the series!!

I go through the local stores and they sell all these TV shows I haven't heard of or heard about in a while. I was pretty disappointed when I reached the ""M"" section of the box sets, and nothing about The Magnificent Seven. But now, I don't have to mourn anymore because I will get my very own copy of this fantastic series! I CANNOT WAIT!

Though, I must admit, I have only seen the pilot, and even with that, I was excited to see the rest of the series, but I never was able to. It went off the air and that was it.

Yes, thank GOD for Showtime for still airing the series occassionally. I just can't wait to get mine in the mail. It will be very exciting!
