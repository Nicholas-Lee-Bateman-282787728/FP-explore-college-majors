Haven't seen this movie for over 30 yeArs and I guess it could be another 30
Oh well s*** happens???",1390348800,,169,4.666666666666667
8164792,4,B000LXGVG8,"This movie i found represents the surfing culture of it's time. The sound tracks are great, and the movie gives the viewer a window what surfing is all about which not only about professional surfers, but ordinary people enjoying the surf scene as well. The movie is not about high tech camera work, it's about capturing the moments as they unfold. An enjoyable movie to watch.",1387152000,,377,4.7272727272727275
8164793,5,B000LXGVG8,"Great movie going back to the single-fin short board semi-guns of the early 70's.  These are still the boards that I ride, but with thruster configuration, wide-point-forward-of-center (corresponding to length of board).  Hard to find master shapers, but Haut (50 + years and counting) is still one of the world's best.  Back to the dvd, the North Shore shots are simple and classic.  My favorites are BK and Lopez.  The music score is great - I bought the LP for it back in the day, and am trying to get it digitalized.",1365984000,,520,4.608695652173913
