8649288,4,B00JAD6GME,"I enjoyed this documentary thoroughly and from the opening scene where the students are quoting scripture at lightning speed I was captivated.  While I found Mikayla's story endearing and sweet, I would have enjoyed more about the Bible Quiz competition itself.  My mother was a coach and led a team to the Junior Bible Quiz National Finals for a local church, which is basically the elementary version of the Bible Quiz competition.  I know the countless hours, endless study sessions, and mental fortitude it took for my mother's team to go to finals and I can only imagine for those quizzers in high school the pressure must be 100 times as intense.  The film only touched on how the students exactly prepare to the level where they're quoting scripture at lightning speed and the intricacies of scoring and ultimately winning in these competitions.  Additionally, there are thousands of dollars in scholarship monies available for quizzers who rank and place but again this was entirely overlooked in the film.  That was my only pet peeve, probably because I've seen firsthand how much commitment quizzing takes and it would have been nice if the film focused a little more on this aspect of quizzing.  However, overall a great film and probably the first time many viewers will have even heard of Bible quizzing, let alone realize there are students and coaches whose lives revolve around these intense competitions.",1429401600,,1421,4.995762711864407
8649289,4,B00JAD6GME,"As a Bible Quiz coach and quizmaster (albeit for a different league), I was intrigued to watch this movie.  From what I read in the editorial description, I thought, ""What league has 3-member teams who memorize the whole Bible in one year?  Is that even possible, as that would be approximately 10,000 verses per quizzer?!""  As I watched, I figured out that this was WBQA quizzing, and they were in the 2008 season:  Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon.  So, far from thousands stated by the editors, the most any quizzer could have memorized that year was 513 verses.  It appeared in the film, although never stated outright, that Mikayla was only assigned one or two books of the five books, which would drop the number down to less than half.

Overall, this was a decent documentary; however, I wish it would have concentrated more on Bible Quiz and less on teen romance.  I applaud Mikayla for handling her mom's problem as privately as possible but also showing that it impacted her life.  I also loved the part where the quizzers defend their faith with the atheist street busker in Seattle.

Parents of girls interested in Bible Quiz, don't worry about this film.  I don't want to give spoilers, but there is nothing more in the way of ""sexuality"" than girls talking about their feelings for boys and their strong convictions about any impure acts before marriage.  Parents of boys, you might want to watch it first and make your own call.

Not my style of music nor my preferred version of the Bible, but a good film on convictions, evangelism, and allowing God to change you as you meditate on His Word.",1422230400,2,1636,4.738515901060071
8649290,5,B00JAD6GME,Bible quizzing I love it I did it in high school and when I got out I coach and have been coaching every year since and this tells what goes on the one thing I do wish they would've done would be have the discussion on eating because that is always a fun thing to listen to,1412553600,,273,3.807017543859649
8649291,5,B00JAD6GME,"An honest look at teenagers competing in both mental and  memory skills,  but also for the attention of those they admire.  Fast moving and captivating.",1409788800,,152,5.0

8649293,4,B00JAD6GME,"I love Mikayla and I want to be her friend. She is so endearing.
Good insight on relationships and the weaknesses of a Christian subculture. Well done.",1403222400,,151,4.62962962962963
8649294,5,B00JAD6GME,"This story was very interesting, and I didn't know that this even existed. I can't even imagine memorizing the whole bible.
Spoiler alert I was very sad when they didn't win.  I really felt for Mikayla, she was so sweet and had such a tough life.
JP wanted to win so much.  It was just a game, but not to them.  The characters in this movie were real and had real emotions. At one point I was listen and watching so intently that  nothing else was around me.
Great story, Im glad I own it.",1403136000,4,489,4.11578947368421
