7934786,3,B00005A0QK,"Featuring far too many men wearing baskets and such over their entire heads, Tang ren piao ke (Screaming Ninja aka Screaming Tiger) manages to entertain despite a pretty weak storyline with a couple of subplots I never really made sense of. I suspect there is a longer, unedited version of this film somewhere out there, as at least one scene refers to something I never saw happen. As for the fighting, I must say there was certainly no shortage of martial arts scenes. I wasn't always sure who was fighting whom until the end, but it was all fun to watch. Unfortunately, the print of this film leaves much to be desired, but you have to remember it was made back in 1973. The English dubbing is typical of 1970s kung fu films - not very good and open to easy ridicule.

Screaming Ninja is actually set in feudal Japan rather than China. Jimmy Wang Yu's character has come to the island nation to avenge the deaths of his entire family back home. He isn't sure of the culprits' actual identities at first, but he gets in lots of practice beating up Japanese guys of all sizes (including Sumo wrestlers) as he goes along. Early on, he gets mixed up with a female pickpocket, and they eventually develop some sort of kinship (I have to admit I never really figured this woman out); then, seemingly through her, he gets himself in the middle of a small war between two competing martial arts schools. It's really all just a means to an end, setting up the big fight scene between hero and villain.

The big fight at the end isn't all that spectacular, but the combatants go at it for quite a while across multiple locations - on top of a train, on a high bridge, in the middle of a roaring river, etc. Jimmy Wang Yu is a good fighter known for his quickness, and his fight scenes are really the only strength of this film. This isn't his best work, but Screaming Ninja features enough kung fu action to appeal to any fan of the genre.",1247616000,,1932,4.408963585434174
7934787,3,B00005A0QK,"After watching Jimmy Wang Yu in ""Blood of the Dragon,"" I couldn't pass this one up.
My chief gripe is that the transfer to (Platinum Disc) DVD is very poor: the film is very dark and, consequently, dim and often featureless.  (I was misled by Platinum's claim on the cover case that the film was ""Digitally Mastered,"" mistakenly thinking I would see a clean, clear, restored print.  No such luck!)
Wang's character has a real attitude, and rubs elbows with some other interesting supporting characters, adding some arresting  twists to an otherwise ""stock"" revenge plot.  The action sequences are frequent and, for the most part, worthwhile.  Although I thought the final fight scene was a bit drawn out (like an old American western fight scene), repetitive and bordering on the tedious; and, frankly, not all that satisfying.
I liked Jimmy Wang Yu in this film, but not as much as I liked him in Blood of the Dragon.  I would award Screaming Ninja 4 stars, if the picture quality were better.  As-is, however, second shelf status.",1048636800,,1032,4.829545454545454
7934788,3,B00005A0QK,This DVD is well worth it's price. Conventional plot.  Chinese guy sets out on revenge against the Japanese who killed his family in China.  If you like movies where one guy fights fifteen guys at once then this is the movie for you.,992044800,,233,4.395348837209302
