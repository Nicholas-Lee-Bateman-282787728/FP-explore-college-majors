1996266,4,B0001FVDVO,"Albuquerque is based on the Luke Short novel Dead Freight for Piute. It stars Randolph Scott & Barbara Britton. George ""Gabby"" Hayes costars in an excellent supporting role.

Cole Armin (Scott) has been summoned by his uncle, John Armin (George Cleveland), to take a job in his freight company. John Armin is less than scrupulous & is attempting to put a competitor out of business. Cole discovers this early & decides to throw in with the competitors, Ted Wallace (Russell Hayden) & his sister Celia Wallace (Catherine Craig). Juke (""Gabby"" Hayes) joins up also as a teamster.

The film opens with a stagecoach holdup that's orchestrated by John Armin from behind the scenes. There aren't any valuables on the coach other than the $10,000 that Celia is carrying to further her brother's shipping company. During the holdup a passenger is killed & Cole wounds one of the outlaws. The gun play causes the stage horses to bolt with a young female child aboard. Cole pulls off a daring rescue to save her. This earns him the friendship of her father which will come to play later in the film.

Lon Chaney, Jr. (Steve Murkil) has a supporting role as a henchman for John Armin. There's also the lovely Barbara Britton (Letty Tyler) who is brought into town by John Armin to work undercover at the Wallace & Armin Freight Line. She ends up switching sides also when things start getting out of hand. Of course Cole & Celia fall in love as do Letty & Ted.

The film is directed by veteran ""B"" Western director Ray Enright who keeps it moving along crisply. The cast is solid as is the script. The only thing annoying is that some of the scenes are done with a filmed background that's way too obvious. Other than that Albuquerque is a great representation of what ""B"" Westerns are.",1238889600,,1775,4.643312101910828
1996267,3,B0001FVDVO,"Can you get past a badly misplaced formula plot to enjoy a generic Randolph Scott western with good acting?

I couldn't but maybe that's because Albuquerque is my home.  Nearby silver mines?  An ANGLO running the city?  A rough frontier town in the late 1800's?  Monumnet Valley scenery?

Where were the genteel Hispano elite who ran an old and charming city on the Rio Grande?  Where were the transportation hub of yore, the Sandia Mtns., the bosque, Old Town?  Hollywood just wrote a script and chose an 'exotic' western name to plug in.  I never did get past that.
Too bad, as the subbort cast (hayden, Gabby Hays, Lon Chaney, Jr.) do a good job backing up Scott and the technicolor is nice.

Editing and directing are passable, although the plotline is eminently predictable.

Maybe Scott or western completists need this film.",1224374400,5,831,4.78169014084507

A very enjoyable story. Gabby was in the driver's seat in the opening scene and in the spotlight in the closing scene. Too bad he wasn't in more of Scott's best films to lighten up Scott's stoicism. It's interesting that the woman Scott ends up with isn't even listed among the major characters, even though she is a major presence throughout the film. In contrast, the lovely but sneaky Barbara Britton is given second billing, despite her belated appearance.  Those of you who used to watch the TV series ""Lassie"" will be surprised to find ""Gramps"" in the chief villain role. Enough said. Find a copy and enjoy.",1186444800,6,786,4.614285714285714
1996270,4,B0001FVDVO,"ALBUQUERQUE aka SILVER CITY a big-budget full 90-minute western from 1948. Based on a Luke Short novel and starring the ever dependable Randolph Scott and most peoples favourite western sidekick George ""Gabby"" Hayes. Although Hayes always played the old timer he was in fact less than 13 years older than the unusually (at times) cheerful Randolph Scott as seen here! Also starring Russell Hayden a real westerner he was probably best known as Hopalong Cassidy's (William Boyd) sidekick `Lucky' Jenkins.

Juke (George `Gabby' Hayes) is the stagecoach driver bound for Albuquerque, New Mexico from El Paso, Texas. On board is Celia Wallace (Catherine Craig) co-owner (with her brother) of the Wallace Freight Company she is delivering a $10,000 business bankroll. Also on board is former Texas Ranger Cole Armin who is taking a job for his uncle John, en-route the stage is held up a man is killed and Miss Wallace is relieved of her bankroll. On arriving in Albuquerque, Cole soon realises that Armin is a dirty word around town, suspecting his uncle knows something about the bankroll heist Cole sets about retrieving the bankroll then switches allegiance to Ted Wallace (Russell Hayden) and his sister. Meanwhile wheelchair-bound John Armin (George Cleveland) who runs the rival Monarch Freighting Company, hires a pretty female spy Letty Tyler (Barbara Britton) to infiltrate and set a trap for the newly formed Wallace (Cole) Armin Freight Company who have just won a contract with the Angel Roost Silver Mine to haul ore down a perilous shale-filled one-way mountain track into town using a ten wagon mule train. Despite a runaway sabotaged wagon with faulty brakes, they still managed somehow to safely negotiate the hill. Celia Wallace met them at the bottom of the hill having come warn them of an ambush by a bunch of hired guns led by John Armin's henchman Steve Murkill (Lon Chaney Jr.) As they set out for town Cole plans a counterattack as they head for the final showdown.

Ray Enfield was the director here; he also directed several more Randolph Scott westerns including the third version of the oft-filmed western THE SPOILERS (1942) in which Scott co-starred with John Wayne and Marlene Dietrich.

This original Cinecolor Paramount film maybe nearly sixty years old (2007) but the transfer to DVD with scene select option is first class. Released under the Universal Western Collection label this is good all round western fare, well worth the money!",1168646400,11,2468,5.058968058968059

With the good guys Scott, Hayes and Hayden ready to set-up a small wagon-freight-hauling business to compete with Cleveland, Chaney and Britton, things are starting to get a little rough with family members Scott and Cleveland (his tyrant Uncle) ~ the freight business isn't big enough for the two of them ~ Scott & Hayden decide to work together as partners to get the big contract with the miners ~ but lookout for Chaney, he wants a piece of Scott and put him permanently in ""boot hill"" ~ the action quickens with some great hard riding ~ someone has tampered with Scott's brakes on his wagon, all going down a steep trail right behind Gabby's wagon...will everything work out...are the wagons going to make it...can Gabby get out of the way of Scott's wagon...does Scott have what it takes to survive without losing his life are the life of others ~ this is a greedy bunch bent on revenge against our favorite western hero ~ Randolph Scott.

From an opening stagecoach chase where the fate of a child hangs in the balance, to a grand finale at break neck speed down a hazardous mountain trail, this tale of good and evil in the Old West is one of Scott's best.  The wonderful cast includes George ""Gabby"" Hayes as Randolph's colorful side-kick and Lon Chaney, Jr., as a bad guy so dense he must have been bronc-tossed a few times on his head.

1996275,5,B0001FVDVO,"Okay, this little review comes in advance of the release of the DVD of Albuquerque, and that may seem a bit odd. Despite that, this is of such importance that a short note is actually due  prior to the release. Randy Scott's Albuquerque is the most elusive of his Westerns. At ""Western festivals"" and among dealers this is the one Scott movie that no one seems to have ever seen or have access to. Some writers have gone so far as to suggest that the movie, originally released I think by Paramount, had been lost. Now that Universal is bringing it out, we can only give thanks that it does indeed exist and will be available (hopefully in the same quality production that characterizes other Universal releases). All reviews of the film indicate that it was an above-average Scott vehicle, with good production values. The cast includes George ""Gabby"" Hayes and Barbara Britton. So, thanks to Universal for this release, and for some of the other very fine oaters listed for release at about the same time [e.g. When the Daltons Rode, Whispering Smith, No Name on the Bullet, etc.]",1080086400,47,1082,4.6947368421052635

1996283,4,B0001FVDVO,"Released in 1948, ""Albuquerque"" is a Western starring Randolph Scott as Cole Armin, who arrives in the New Mexican town to work for his wicked uncle's ore-hauling freight line. When he discovers overt corruption, he switches to another company with an eye on his partner's sister (Catherine Craig). Meanwhile his uncle hires a hottie spy (Barbara Britton) from out of town to destroy the competition.

Reviewer msroz said it best in describing ""Albuquerque"" as an ""okay and likable western, neither exceptional nor routine."" The story is interesting, but loses momentum here and there; aspects of the film are better than the whole. One aspect that's great is the cast: Scott's amiable as the protagonist, George Cleveland is effective as the wannabe godfather of Albuquerque, Lon Chaney is formidable as one of the main heavies and the two women are gorgeous, especially Catherine Craig. She's both stunning and winsome. Another great element is the scenic Southwest locations, shot in Sedona, Arizona, and Iverson Ranch, California.

As long as you can adapt to the old-style of fimmaking ""Albuquerque is a worthwhile Western, but it's hampered by the negatives noted above.

The film runs 90 minutes.

1996284,4,B0001FVDVO,"In director Ray Enright's ALBUQUERQUE, Ol' Gabby's in top form as Juke, a sputtering, bewhiskered mule cart driver.

It's a typical story of a small hauling outfit trying to honestly compete with the big firm that's run by a man who will do anything to stop his competition from succeeding. The plot twist is the crooked boss (Cleveland) is uncle of Cole Armin, a handsome cowpoke (Scott) who's just arrived on a stage from Texas.

When Cole realizes the extent of his uncle's evil ambitions, he refuses a management job and instead joins up with Ted and Celia Wallace (Hayden & Craig), sibling owners of the struggling Wallace Shipping Co. (Uncle) John Armin responds by hiriing lovely Letty Tyler (Britton) to spy from the inside on Cole and the Wallaces, but eventually guilt and scruples turn Letty against the elder Armin.

Also as expected, Cole falls for Celia, who returns his affections until she suspects Cole's been two-timing with Letty. Juke also has a problem: a tonsorial artist sweetheart who's aiming to shave him clean. So there's lots here to be sorted out before THE END flashes on the screen.

In typical 'B' western fashion this one has several moments of violence, all perpetrated by or for the evil big businessman. Best of these is a sabotaged ore-laden 12 mule cart that careens brakeless down a sharp-curved road on an impossibly steep mountainside.

It's solid western entertainment where the hero ultimately triumphs and the villains eat dirt.

1996293,4,B0001FVDVO,"A stagecoach robbery - a young couple (Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig) are divested of $10,000, and the coach nearly carries off young Myrtle (Karolyn Grimes), who would be lost if not for handsome stranger Cole (Randolph Scott). When the coach gets to Albuquerque, we learn that the couple are the Wallaces, Ted and Celia - a brother and sister (Cole of course is interested in the sister pretty much from the start), and the money was to start up an ore freighting company in competition with John Armin (George Cleveland), the nasty and unscrupulous ruler of just about everything in town. It turns out that Cole is actually Mr. Armin's nephew, and has come to Albuquerque for a family job - but it's not revealing too much to say that an upright Randolph Scott character isn't going to work long for a completely amoral businessman who won't even stop at murder to control the town. Soon Cole is paired up with stagecoach driver Juke (Gabby Hayes) helping the Wallaces, but Armin has lots of trouble cooked up to stop the upstarts, including his pocketed sheriff (Bernard Nedell), big dumb thug Merkle (Lon Chaney Jr), and eventually a charming diversion and spy (Barbara Britton). Cole and company will have their hands full getting their ore down treacherous paths - and getting the town out of the hands of the bad men.

There isn't anything particularly novel or exciting about ALBUQUERQUE - based on a book by famed western pulp writer Luke Short - and Ray Enright's direction can best be described as ""efficient"" and ""solid"".  It seems to straddle the A-B levels in a strange way; at 87 minutes it's a bit long for a ""b"" western, but it's filmed in the cheap, mediocre Cinecolor process - all the reds look brownish or orange, the blues are dull, green and yellow practically nonexistant.  Several of Scott's color westerns made between 1947-51 suffer from this watered-down color technology, unfortunately.  But the cast is definitely closer to ""a"" level, and what a cast it is!  Not too many Randy Scott films I've seen have such a wealth of fine character actors and principals, from the devious and beautiful Britton, to western sidekick stalwart Hayes - in the best role I've seen him in - to the most minor roles, like waiter Harvey (Dick Elliott - a short, fat actor who was in almost 300 films playing excitable, agitated characters). It also shares a couple of interesting (if fairly trivial) elements with 1946's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, having two actors (Elliott and child actress Grimes, who played Zuzu in the Capra film) in common, and having as the main bad guy a wheelchair-bound businessman who at one point holds a large sum of money belonging to the protaganists.

So basically this is a film to enjoy on a scene-by-scene basis. Every time Gabby is on screen it's a joy; villains Chaney and Nedell are lots of fun; there are some good fight sequences, one of them involving a whip; and we get a nice large-scale shootout in the emptied town for a climax. I wouldn't think this would be on most people's lists of best Scott films, and it doesn't rank all that high amongst genre films for 1948, one of the great years for the western - but it's lots of fun, and it doesn't have any significant problems apart from the less-than gorgeous color.

Universal's disc looks decent enough, apart from a few momentary patches of ghosting; it strikes me that they may have boosted the contrast a little bit, but this is a good choice with a muted and dull color scheme like the one present here.  The only extras are subtitles in Spanish and French, and close captioning.",1291852800,3,3593,4.701112877583466
1996294,5,B0001FVDVO,Albuquerque is an excellent western that movies energetically through the plot.  No real surprises in the story.  Technical quality of the DVD was excellent.,1273708800,2,157,5.5
1996295,4,B0001FVDVO,"Randolph Scott was an American icon, the quintessential western hero who exhibited fewer emotions than Clint Eastwood and Gary Cooper and spoke fewer lines than either of those western stars. Was he a great actor -- probably not. Was he like many real characters who existed in the American west -- possibly. Was he believable as a hero who seemed interested in women -- not really. A romantic lead he was not.  Will he be forgotten as an actor who appeared in more westerns than most American actors -- probably not. Like John Wayne whose best western role was in THE SEARCHERS, Scott's best role was arguably his last performance in Sam Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY (GUNS IN THE AFTERNOON), but who can turn in a bad performance with Peckinpah as a director?

My favorite of the Scott westerns is DECISION AT SUNDOWN because of its unexpected ending where Scott discovers that he is defending the reputation of a woman whose morals are not worth defending. Compared to SUNDOWN and other westerns later in his career, ALBUQUERQUE does not really stand up. That said, we must admit that the story, based on a work by the well-known Luke Short, is complex enough to be interesting.  Barbara Britton is the mystery character who plays her cards close to her lovely chest. That she does not turn out to be Scott's love interest plays against some expectations, but Russell Hayden is on hand to provide that role.

Of course, it is always fun to see George (Gabby) Hayes in these old westerns, the old coot type who shows that he can still twirl a hand-gun better than anyone. That he still plays himself, as other reviewers have stated, is probably not surprising. To have him play a believable villain instead of a crusty, lovable good guy-- now that would be a surprise. His trademark has to be his immense bush of whiskers. As George Carlin once remarked, some actors have beards -- which sometimes sounds a little ominous -- but Gabby Hayes
has whiskers. That Scott and the other good guys in the film want to see him shave them off completely really strains credibility. Asking Hayes to appear without his whiskers is like asking John Wayne to play an effeminate character or Glenn Ford to appear in a western without his familiar black hat. Ain't gonna happen.

ALBUQUERQUE (how many people can correctly spell the name of that New Mexico city without looking it up?) is a serviceable western in the matinee mode of THE SUNDOWNERS and HIGH LONESOME, suitable for a double feature and for those Scott fans who want to have a complete collection, but don't expect anything in the mode of DECISION AT SUNDOWN or THE TALL T.  For something that shows what the west must have really been like, check out SHANE, or COWBOY, or THE CULPEPPER CATTLE COMPANY.

After all, as the Mel Brooks film states: ""You'd do it for Randolph Scott.""",1249948800,,2834,4.690140845070423
