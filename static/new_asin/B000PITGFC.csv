8191937,5,B000PITGFC,"I must admit when I purchased this film as a gift, I did not expect it to be much of anything.  However, after a bit, my wife and I watched the story in absolute awe. This is an absolutely incredible film of the experience spiritual yearning and searching. We kept waiting for it to turn stupid but,it never did. It is an honest attempt to share a look into true mystical experience and to experience the longing that pulls all those who really seek into the wilderness of the mind-world therein to find what we are seeking. It also affirms to the seeker that there are those of like mind.

There are those who will find it weird. Let them! They are blind.

Well done sir,well done.",1206489600,3,682,4.354330708661418
8191938,4,B000PITGFC,"Prerequiste Information: Probably the first thing that will attract you to this film is the curious title. Exactly what does Kuksu mean? Well decided to do a little investigation and came up with the following;

- Kuksu, or the Kuksu Cult was a central California shamanic religion active before and during the initial influx of white settlers to the area.
- It was a male dominated secret society which allowed only its specially initiated and instructed members to participate in the esoteric rites and rituals of the community.
- Kuksu literally means ""big head"" which was symbolized by the oversized headdresses worn when impersonating sacred spirits during trance dancing.

Synopsis: The time is the early 1900's, the place probably California. Caroline and her younger sister live with their Uncle, a man of science and reason who serves as their only parental authority. He has raised them to become civilized, clear thinking, proper young women possessing clarity of mind and strong, traditional social values. Little does he know that when alone they partake in strange shamanistic rites of their own making which includes occasionally dancing naked in the moonlight while chanting to the spirits of the night.

When the girls are informed that they will soon be moving into a new home for young women to complete their education they fear their communion with the spirits will be disrupted and decide to escape into the wilderness to seek supernatural guidance. As the girls are wandering about in search of unconventional wisdom their Uncle is not far behind in hot pursuit of the wayward pair. What they eventually discover is not what any of them expected.

Critique: The '07 film `Kuksu' is a visual poem, a contemplative, dreamlike film that attempts to explore the boundaries of the human psyche and the thin veil dividing order from chaos, mind from spirit and dreams from wakefulness. It's also parable about a feminine rite of passage into adulthood, one that pays homage to the ""Old Ways"" of communing with the spirit within all things. An excursion not only into the physical wilderness, but a journey into ""a dense mystery"" where one loses oneself in order to eventually return to civilization with clarity and a vision of that will forever alter how they perceive the world around them.

This is definitely not a big budget film, but it certainly contains a quaint charm all its own. With the exception of Doreen Stelton in the role as Caroline the acting is extremely stiff and amateurish. Furthermore the cinematic images unfolding before the audience have a tendency to wobble and move in and out of focus at times. This could be a sign of poor camera work or an intentional action to evoke an otherworldy texture to the storyline. Accidental or intentional the technique seems to work.

What made this film something special for me was the intermittent comentary provided by the films main character (Doreen Stelton). Like some profound, meditative, stream of consciousness her words weave their way in and out of the plot adding a depth of meaning that makes each image and action on the screen pregnant with existential potency.

My Rating: `Kuksu' is a film that will appeal only to a very small, select audience. If you're into introspective, mystical tales that plant seedings of thought to digest at some future date I think you will appreciate this little film as much as I do; -4 Stars-.",1200268800,9,3422,4.961605584642234
