3910525,5,B002DH20PQ,This series is  excellent! I have been looking for the complete series for a long time. I highly recommend it for those who like the old black and white westerns.,1253836800,4,162,4.4
3910526,5,B002DH20PQ,"If you like classic westerns and you like Steve McQueen, this is great find.

I was exposed to this series while living out of the US over 20 years ago.  My wife and I loved the series.  So when I saw it was available at a reasonable price I pre-purchased the series.

With 94, 1/2 hour episodes, I expect to watch this series for years to come.

I found the picture and sound quality are very good for a TV series shot between 1958 and 1961.",1253664000,93,442,4.093023255813954
3910527,5,B002DH20PQ,"I was surprised to find all three seasons at such a rock bottom price.  Since the price was so good, I thought it might have some cheap quality.  I check-out reviews others made for single seasons.  The clarity and quality on these is 9 to 9.5 out of 10.  I have had no freeze or pix problems as of yet (haven't viewed ALL 9, one-sided discs).  The storylines are of the quality that Gunsmoke had during the Chester and Quint years.  This is a great deal for any western fan.  The protagonist, played by Steve McQueen, is a bounty hunter who balances ethics with (of course) the bounty $$$ he's after.  4 to 5 *s!!!.",1247270400,188,616,4.2956521739130435

Just imagine the scale they buy them on how cheap they get them. Gave  as gift was ashamed when they were opened due to cheap packing of disc. Which is why gave it 3 stars.

Watched on tv. Great story line. Can't believe the show did not last longer. It had Steve McQueen. Loved his special gun. Read article where he really shot the gun and practiced. He used 1/2 loads,1/4 loads and cowboy loads. He said when he fired it at full load blanks almost knocked him back two steps. Few time he ended up with innocent person. He helped clear everything up. It was the problem of getting people wanted dead or alive back to authority. In time when was not enough  sheriff and  deputy to go around. Little adventure and little humor and action adventure in one show.",1430265600,,900,4.403614457831325

3910587,5,B002DH20PQ,"Steve McQueen, what more needs to be said.  This is a very good series that should have lasted longer than it did.  I am not sure if it ended due to the studio or that McQueen had started to become such a huge star that this series could no longer contain him. Also, this is the series that led to the movie that Rutger Hauer starred in with the same name in 1987.  Hauer played the grandson of the character that McQueen played in the t.v. series.",1411862400,,448,4.126436781609195
3910588,5,B002DH20PQ,For this being Steve McQueen's first stint on acting this is a great series to have as a collection. I am very happy with my purchase.,1411862400,,134,4.1923076923076925
3910589,1,B002DH20PQ,Love this when it was on television. Unfortunately I am deaf now and I wasted my money buying because it. It has no caps or subtitles.,1410912000,,134,4.1923076923076925
3910590,5,B002DH20PQ,"I loved watching all of these over after so many, many years!  Steve showed all sides in these stories.  He could be serious and hurt or kill you if he found it necessary.  He preferred to bring them in alive and did not approve of DEAD unless there was absolutely no other way to bring them in to the sheriff or Marshall.

He showed the comedy side in some of the episodes and they were a pleasure to see!  There were a few romantic scenes but they were kept to a small amount.  I liked that fact but I will admit I did fall in love with him then.  As a child I knew he was different!  I was not proved wrong because he became a big sex symbol in the years to come.  He had IT!

Seeing so many of the characters were not only stars of the time period (1958 to 1961); there were so many stars of the future too.  Jeanne Cooper, Mary Tyler Moore, Nick Adams, Michael Landon, Don Gordon and Lee Van Cleef to name a few.  He even had James Coburn and Brad Dexter two of the Magnificent Seven on the show.  James Coburn appeared twice!  If you love Steve McQueen you will love this series.  When they do the opening for each show Steve looks like a baby...he was not 30 yet when he started this show.",1410912000,,1196,4.051282051282051

3910608,3,B002DH20PQ,I like the episodes but the some of the discs emit a loud staccato noise when placed in my DVD player.  It's not in the sound track but from another source. This is new to me and I have over a thousand DVD's in my collection including other Mill Creek products.,1393891200,,261,4.117647058823529
3910609,4,B002DH20PQ,"Yes, many of the episodes have less-than-stellar sound (muddy), but if you are quick on the Mute button on the opening credits, it is no big deal.

My only reason for not 5 stars?  The packaging.  Less than it could be, but then, on the other hand, all of the discs do have the episode titles on the label.

I have not watched them all (that is a lot of television!), but so far the first 5 discs have played flawlessly.

GREAT PRICE!  I wish ""Rawhide"" was so easy on the pocketbook.",1393200000,,483,4.195652173913044

Steve McQueen was excellent in this series!,1392768000,,397,4.605633802816901
3910611,5,B002DH20PQ,"This 11 DVD set is more than a bargain at under $20.00!  ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" was the western TV series that brought fame to young actor Steve McQueen.
Excellent packaging by Mill Creek Entertainment. The video is crisp and clear.
There are many guest stars in these 94 half hour episodes. Early appearances by Michael Landon(later Little Joe in Bonanza); James Coburn; DeForest Kelley(later of Star Trek)and many others.
The stories are well written and well acted. Steve McQueen's ""cool persona"" was the highlight of this classic series.
I highly recommend it to any fan of early TV westerns.",1392508800,,597,4.97

So wonderful to own and to enjoy them anytime we want. Thank you for this opportunity, Amazon!",1388275200,,399,4.333333333333333
3910617,5,B002DH20PQ,This was the best of the Western bounty hunter series.  Paladin was an amateur.  I'll take Steve McQueen and his Mare's Leg any day.  McQueen was the real deal.,1388102400,,160,4.448275862068965

3910619,5,B002DH20PQ,Even better without commercials. plays well. Only thing is no original show from Josh Randall intro. I can't remember the other shows name. But it was the first apperance of the caracter.,1386633600,,187,4.875
3910620,5,B002DH20PQ,"No one says ""cool"" like Steve McQueen, right? The obvious hook here is that the lead character is a bounty hunter, an occupation that is always portrayed as ""evil"" in other series. Other than that, the story lines are nothing special, but having an actor as good as Mr. McQueen raises the whole series to a higher level. Some of the stories are deadly serious and some border on light comedy. No matter which, Mr. McQueen delivers his lines in such a natural manner as to foretell his future Superstar success. If you like Steve McQueen, and you like westerns, you'll love this collection!",1385683200,,589,4.673076923076923
3910621,5,B002DH20PQ,"Love these old westerns,The picture quality isn't the best,but I can live it. A young Steve McQueen, the Riflemans saw off rifle, combined to make a good western series.",1385164800,,169,4.862068965517241
3910622,5,B002DH20PQ,"Very enjoyable collection.  We'll worth the price.  If you like westerns, you will not be disappointed.  Very similar to The Rifleman.",1384560000,,134,5.285714285714286
3910623,5,B002DH20PQ,"This is the best TV western of all time in my opinion, starring one of the greatest action stars of all time. Steve McQueen ranks up there with the likes of Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, and John Wayne. It surprises me this show lasted only 3 seasons when so many other westerns stayed on television for years (i.e. Gunsmoke, Rawhide, The Rifleman). I had never heard of this show until a firearms company came out with a gun modeled after Steve McQueen's character's so-called ""Mare's Leg"" (a sort of sawed-off lever action Winchester Rifle), which he carried in a custom made holster. This gun is one of the most interesting guns in TV western history and has become just as famous as McQueen's character Josh Randall. In this show, Randall is a sort of bounty hunter who goes from one town to another bringing outlaws to justice. The show features guest stars like Lee Van Cleef, James Coburn, Mary Tyler Moore, Warren Oates, DeForest Kelley, and many more. All 3 seasons are in this set, as well as special features, including a bit on the now infamous Mare's Leg. I love this western. It's Steve McQueen at his best!!!!!!!",1384560000,,1130,4.683417085427136
3910624,5,B002DH20PQ,"This is a TV show from my youth (1958-1961) and it made Steve McQueen a star.  I bought it for a trip down memory lane.  It contains 94 shows (30 min less commercials).  It is a black and white series, but the picture is crisp and clear.  Occasionally a plot is a bit corny, but not to much so that you don't enjoy watching.  We haven't completed them all yet, but are very pleased with the quality and have enjoyed the ones we have seen.  Remember the times and expect plots, etc, from those years (i.e. Gunsmoke)  and you will not be disappointed.  McQueen had a rough upbringing and was difficult to work with.  However, he was popular with the public and became the highest paid actor of his time (died age 50 of lung cancer).  It was good to see his early work and to see other familiar actors in their youth.",1384387200,2,814,4.261437908496732

Josh Randall's gun (like Rifleman's) fascinates me a lot
And I like that he's a bounty hunter with a heart

HERE'S where the trouble begins
I started googling the show and McQueen for more

Pre-Wanted D o A, McQueen was nobody
The show made him famous - enough for the makers of Magnificent 7 to want him

But because of Wanted, he couldn't do Mag 7
The chance was too good to pass up
So McQueen faked injury
He crashed his car into a tree

Then when he was on medical leave, he did Mag 7

And because Mag 7 made McQueen famous, he didn't want to do Wanted anymore
So the series ended

Until now, I've always thought he was really cool
Now that I know what he did, quite a bit of the appeal's gone
Yeah, I know, it's just a show

Would have been nice and cool if Steve McQueen were as upright as Josh Randall",1364860800,,829,4.0182926829268295

I already had the first season, but I couldn't pass up the pricing on this complete series package. I love classic television shows, and Wanted Dead or Alive is truly a classic. Steve McQueen was perfect for the role of Josh Randall, and it's fun to see other wonderful actors such as Martin Landeau and Michael Landon in early roles before they became well known. And I'm constantly amazed that the early television writers could write such wonderful stories to fit into the half-hour shows that were the norm back then. As for the picture and sound quality, I'd give 10 stars if I could. No, it's not BluRay (thank goodness), but the picture is crisp and clear(better than the original picture on the televisions that were ""state of the art"" at the time this series was produced).

3910656,5,B002DH20PQ,"""Wanted: Dead or Alive"", aired 1958 - 1961 on CBS.  As a very young child, I remember my father watching this series in prime time.  It was one of his favorites, and it is one of mine too.  Josh Randall (McQueen) is a bounty hunter with a heart.  He is as fair and just as a judge, yet, can shoot his ""Mare's Leg"" (sawed off Winchester 1892 rifle) as deadly and as fast as anyone.  In each show he goes after a wanted criminal, and each episode is as unique as the one before, no two are the same.  The writers did a wonderfully creative job in crafting scripts that were exciting, dramatic, and realistic.  The episodes are only 26 minutes long each, so it is easy to sit down to watch one or more, and have some fine western style entertainment.  McQueen is excellent in this series, just a terrific actor, and I believe this show launched his career as a movie star.  As a fan of westerns, I find this show just as entertaining as ""Bonanza"", ""The Big Valley"", or ""Gunsmoke"", but with a slightly harder and more exciting edge.  It is also a treat to see the assortment of character actors appear in this show, such as Michael Landon, Jay North (Dennis the Menace), Noah Berry, Lon Chaney Jr., Jim Coburn, Alan Hale (Skipper from Gilligan), De Kelly (Bones from Star Trek), and William Schallert (the father from the Patty Duke Show).

The entire series is in this well-made DVD set.  The tape transfer is not perfect, sometimes the sound is a bit uneven, but overall, for a show that aired over 60 years ago, I am impressed with the quality of the picture.  If you are a western fan, I guarantee partner that you will absolutely love this series.  Easily 5 stars for the entertainment value, Steve McQueen's acting, and value for the price.  You can't miss with this one.

Season 2 was intresting as he was a mentor to a Bounty Hunter wanna be, Oklahoma Boy Wright King. Then his character was dropped without a word. Too bad. Should've had some explanation.

He would help to clear the names of the wrongly accused, and gave away most, or all of the bounty, to help someone in need. In one episode, except for a few dollars he keeps for himself, he asks someone if he can figure a way to have the money deposited in a certain persons bank account, without the person knowing. He was basically told, he has a bad reputation, but if people knew he did such things, he would have more friends. His answer was, ""People who have to know, I don't want as friends"".

The story lines are good, and will keep your interest. I think they rate with ""The Rifleman"" as some of the best tv westerns of those days. There are guest appearances by Michael Landon, Nick Adams, James Coburn, Lon Chaney Jr, Dyan Cannon, Mary Tyler Moore and many more well known names, from movies and television.

WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE premiered the same month as The Rifleman. The show lasted three seasons, from September 1958 to March 1961. There are 94 episodes and 5 featurettes on 11 discs. The discs are in a sturdy case, with each individual disc in a black paper sleeve with a clear plastic window. The episode names are printed on each disc. These shows are in black and white, but the audio and video quality are perfect. If you're a fan of classic westerns, this is something I think you will enjoy.",1298678400,2,1410,4.44015444015444
3910704,4,B002DH20PQ,"This popular series has remained a hit and it is easy to see why.
If you are a Western fan, then its appeal is that of a 'classic' Western series.
The picture quality is good for that era, though many would wish that they would re-master it in COLOR---which would offer the viewer a great deal more in appeal and ability to appreciate the wonderful scenery, as well as making it really come alive.  Color adds depth to each scene as well as the over all reality.
Life is not in black and white...and never was.  The life of a cowboy was mostly outdoors, and people appreciated the beauty of scenery, sunsets, etc.

The last season episodes leave a bit to be desired in terms of variation of story line.  It becomes the same old plot with nothing new.
The first season was clearly the best.  My two favorite episodes were ""Till Death Do Us Part"" though the ending was silly and not believable.  The other episode about Christmas and a little boy wishing for a rifle to help his sheep rancher father was excellent and gave Steve McQueen a real chance to show his many talents.

Many female Steve McQueen fans will lament that fact that as each season passed, there were fewer and fewer episodes where Josh Randal interacted with women.  Definitely lacking in romance--which was an area that McQueen excelled in as an actor.  Again, the plots became too much alike.",1298246400,,1362,4.549180327868853

Disc 2 had three shows on it that we couldn't watch.  They were ""Sheriff of Red Rock"", ""Die by the Gun"", and ""Rawhide Breed"".  The dvd would hang up and not move forward.

Steve McQueen establishes a persona that works fairly well throughout the series.  He gets hit on the head or beat up in practically every episode.  His gun and holser are the main gimmic of the show.  The need to use two hands for the second shot is rather limiting, but that is glossed over in the action.

3910733,5,B002DH20PQ,"Considering what I paid for this set from Millcreek, I think the value is outstanding.  The transfers for a 1958 TV production are very good.  McQueen projects the early star quality that was to eventually elevate him to movie star. If you're a McQueen fan, this set is well worth it.
Classic film fans will enjoy seeing the likes of Ralph Meeker, James Coburn, Bethel Leslie, Mon Freeman, Gloria Talbot, among others, appear as guest actors.  For the most part the episodes are very well written.  I enjoy watching the end credits only to find that a good episode was written by the likes of sci-fi writer Charles Beaumont (""Twilight Zone"") or playwright Frank D.

Some reviews express a dissatisfaction with the packaging, but I personally don't have an issue with it.

3910734,5,B002DH20PQ,"This is an excellent black & white western series. Every episode  has a story line. I have watched about 60 of the 94 episodes. I have a new appreciation of Steve McQueen. He is an excellent actor, It is well worth the price",1278374400,,224,4.209302325581396
3910735,5,B002DH20PQ,"I was just old enough to start noticing boys when Wanted: Dead or Alive began its run, so Steve McQueen caught my eye. His boyish looks, big sky-blue eyes, charming grin and lithe body were striking -- and oh my, that mare's leg rifle! I loved watching him saunter up to the bulletin board every week and rip that wanted poster off, then look at us with steely-eyed intent. Whoa! Sex appeal, presence and star power: Steve had it all even then.

I matured enough along with the series to appreciate McQueen's acting style: spare, intense and so cool you could make ice cubes with it. And, he moved beautifully. His graceful athleticism enhanced his believability as an action hero; he rode horses, handled weapons and performed fight scenes with enviable skill. Despite the obvious back-lot sets, you believed he was bounty hunter Josh Randall, plying his notorious trade around the Old West.

I hadn't seen Wanted: Dead or Alive since it ended in 1961, so being able to own and watch all 92 episodes now has been a treat. The show is as good and solid as I remembered it; so is McQueen, who launched his amazingly successful film career on its popularity and critical acclaim.

Happily, the original negatives were preserved and have been properly handled for this DVD set. The black and white images are uniformly crisp and free of artifacts, and the monaural soundtrack is clean. The extras aren't much, but they do provide background material that should please old fans and enlighten new viewers. Wouldn't you like to know more about the mare's leg?

IMO the best part about owning this collection is being able to observe McQueen's metamorphosis from novice performer into solid actor over a three-year period in chronological fashion. You can see him working hard to bring his nascent acting skills up to the bar set by the many great character actors that guest-starred on the show. It's interesting to watch him work with the likes of Noah Beery Jr., Joan Blondell, Lon Chaney Jr., John Dehner, John Carradine, James Coburn, Lee Van Cleef and William Schallert. Obviously, the kid studied up on their skills and scene-stealing bits of business. And it's fun to spot other young up-and-comers like Warren Oates, Cloris Leachman, Michael Landon, Richard Farnsworth and Mary Tyler Moore learning their craft in small roles.

It's a shame that McQueen died too soon for us to know how he might have played character parts as he grew old, but the Wanted: Dead or Alive collection lets us see where and how he got his start. It's also a great way to ride again with Josh Randall, hunt down the bad guys and help the good folks get justice. Let's go, pard.",1277942400,7,2658,4.75704989154013

The set comes as a plastic box with 13 paper holders for each of the labelled, single-side DVDs.  Good enough.  However, I found that some disks were VERY noisy.  Amazon sent FAST & FREE replacements so all I can say is that if you buy this set, BUY IT FROM AMAZON!

These are a Mill Creek production-- reasonable transfers and disk menus with NO LOGOS on the actual shows-- GOOD!  Now, Mill Creek only needs to work on their quality.

I will also point out that Mill Creek Entertainment not only beats the pants off the other big video companies for price and seasons combined, but I called them on the phone when one of the disc had a small scratch and failed to play a couple of the episodes and they sent me a new disc free; and on top of that, they set me one of their DVD sets on Old West Gunfighters and Outlaws free as well. That set was great also! CBS Paramount, and all the others trying to milk us should take notice.

3910742,5,B002DH20PQ,"I had never watched this show before, but at the price of $13.99 for 94 episodes I took a chance. It is a terrific set. I ended up loving the show.  The only thing is the show itself. Sometimes the show ended before it had a proper ending. The writers should have ended it with a resolution for every episode. Some had proper endings with a proper resolution. Some episodes had a ""I hope
so"" kind of ending. Now there's some of the titles. The writers titled some of the episode wrong. In ""The Littlest Client"" the girl was not Josh's littlest client. Jay North on ""Eight Cent Reward"" was the Littlest. I haven't watched all the episodes yet, but between the two Jay North was the littlest. Then there is the actors. Like ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" and The Adventures of Superman"" they use the same actor as different characters. I hate that. My question is weren't there any other actors around back then to play the parts. I can understand ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" there not being enough actors considering it lasted 14 seasons, but with ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" lasting only 94 episodes I can't believe there weren't enough different actors to play the parts. It could have been because the producers like those particular actors, but that is no excuse. With that said I still love the show.",1275177600,,1317,4.580508474576271

We would sit down in front of the old black and white tv (this is before color was invented) to watch these new shows.  This gives me a chance to reminisce a bit.,1274140800,,248,4.040816326530612
3910744,5,B002DH20PQ,"After struggling for recognition in obscure movie roles, Steve McQueen caught lightning in a bottle as Josh Randell in the exciting western series, Wanted: Dead or Alive. Mill Creek presents all 94 episodes for a more than reasonable price.

Each episode is a taut half hour of action and entertainment lead by McQueen's magnetic character. He plays Randell as the quiet hero who chases his prey for the reward, but abides by his morels. It's facinating to watch McQueen act almost constantly, even when he's in the background. He finds the little quirks, reacting to coffee that's a little too hot, or doing a double take that draws you to his character.

The transfers are crisp and clean, perhaps a little too clean as it reveals the limited budget of the series. As they used the same interior set for almost every town Randell visits, only changing the signs over the Saloon or Livery Stable. Randell also takes plenty of whacks to the head, so many that you wonder how he can think after a while. Like many movies and tv shows, ""Wanted"" plays around with history as the opening title card for the episode ""Double Fee"" states the year ""1871"" which is consistant with Randell occasional mentions of his service in the Confederate Army, but inconsistant with his 1892 Winchester and using the terms ""Oklahoma"", which didn't become a state until 1907. And the shows themselves vary in writing quality, which is to be expected over a 94 episode run. Yet the short running time also means that many of the episodes start in the middle of the action like ""Desert Seed"".

We also see plenty of familiar faces, sometimes more than once each season as they began their acting careers. Warren Oates, James Coburn, Micheal Landon (as a bad guy no less in the first episode ""The Martin Poster"") Mary Tyler Moore, and Lee Van Cleef. Joining them are more established veterans like Kenneth Tobey (""The Thing from Another World""), the great Everett Sloan (""Citizen Kane"") and the not-as-yet Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy, DeForest Kelley.

On the downside, the four ""special features"" are nothing of note. ""Reckless: The Women of Wanted"" is pure puffery covering only a few of the many female characters that appeared in the show. ""The Art of the Replica"" & ""Winchester: A Weapon of Legend"" are interesting, but have little to do with the series itself. ""The Mare's Leg"" is the only relavent feature as it deals with Randell's unique weapon. For what's it worth, it's better to build the ""Mare's Leg"" from scratch (that's legal), than to cut down an existing 1892 Winchester (that's illegal).

The packaging is rather unique, all the DVDs are contained in individual sleeves and stuffed in the the center of the large, plastic case. This does have the advantage of bringing only one or two DVDs over to your buddies's place to watch. ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" is not the best western series ever made, but it is vastly entertaining and instructive for those unfamiliar with the ""King of Cool"",  Steve McQueen's legend began here.",1273968000,3,3005,4.813953488372093

3910752,5,B002DH20PQ,"I recently purchased the complete series of the classic western show, Wanted; Dead or Alive. I can vividly recall watching the series on television in the late 1950's in Australia which was only one of three westerns worthwhile watching. I still rate Have Gun Will Travel as the doyen of westerns, closely followed by Wanted: Dead or Alive and The Restless Gun.

This attractively packaged set covers all three seasons spanning 94 episodes from 1958 to 1961. Steve McQueen plays the role of Josh Randall, a bounty hunter in the days where there was no law and murders were an everyday occurrence. Like Paladin in Have Gun Will Travel, and Vint Bonner in The Restless Gun; Josh Randall had both morals and ethics. They never killed for the sake of killing and only defended themselves to avoid being killed.

In this series, Josh Randall never used a six-gun, but a sawn-off Winchester 1892 model carbine rifle. With the bigger gauge bullet, his victims never stood a chance. He stood for law and order, and if he believed his prey was innocent, he would defend them with his life; seeking out the guilty at the same time. Widows and others inconvenienced by misfortune, often received the bounty collected from Randall.

Until this western series began, Steve McQueen was relatively unknown. At the same time of the release of this series. McQueen also starred in a forgettable sci-fi movie called The Blob. It was in Wanted: Dead or alive that McQueen as Josh Randall really excelled and he soon rocketed to fame in great movies. Two of these movies, The Magnificent Seven (1960) and Nevada Smith (1966) saw him play a similar cowboy role.

I am not sure if these DVD released have been remastered at all, but the quality of the episodes is excellent. Back in the 1950's, television antennae and reception was of very poor quality, so it was a pleasure to see these episodes replayed in cinema quality reproduction.

The other aspect I loved watching this old series was the support cast used. Many of these support actors went on to be stars themselves, as well as having their own shows. Picking out these old actors is easy, as faces do not change much, they just weather and get more wrinkles.

Such support actors in the show include: James Coburn, Michael Landon, Alan Hale, Warren Oates, Jay North, DeForest Kelley, Michael Pate, Clu Gulager, Lee Van Cleef, Lon Chaney Jr, Dyan Cannon, Wayne Rogers, Martin Landau, John Carradine, Claude Akins, Harold J Stone, Mary Tyler Moore, Cloris Leachman, Richard Anderson, Noah Beery Jr, and many others.

This is a series I would definitely recommend for enjoyment, and reliving the past with a touch of Nostalgia. Steve McQueen was a star back then, and today, some 30 years after his death, his legend will go on.",1268352000,34,2765,4.796218487394958

3910754,5,B002DH20PQ,"I love these Steve McQueen/Josh Randall shows! I first found part of Season One in Wal Mart's bargain bin and, because I loved McQueen in The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape, I bought it.  I had never even known that this series existed.  I was born in 1960, though, and because my parents loved westerns, I am sure that I probably ""watched"" some of these as a baby.  At least, I'd like to think that I did! :)
  Anyway, I loved that first one so much, I began looking for the rest. As soon as I found this complete series set, I gleefully snapped it up! (And what a great price!) I am thoroughly enjoying watching them every evening!  The episodes are interesting, and I especially enjoy getting to see some of the western country that I grew up in - and very much miss.  But, best of all, Steve McQueen is just such a cute and intriguing fellow - and especially so in these! Now, it's true that some of the acting is a bit corny and some of the plots aren't that great, but it's SO much better than the trash that's on nowadays!
  As far as quality goes, it's been great. I am halfway through the second season, and I have not noticed any problems whatsoever.  Get yourself a set and ENJOY!",1268006400,2,1199,4.265486725663717

This eleven disc box set contains all 94 episodes in a short three season run, seems most of the western tv series of the era only ran for a limited time, with the exception of Gunsmoke, McQueen probably needed a change to motion pictures, starring in the ""Magnificent Seven"". Randall is the drifter who takes on just about any job or task for cash, including searching for a ""pet sheep"". You've gotta love the sawed off winchester hanging off the belt with three inch cartridges in each slot or the four chambered deringer Randall keeps concealed in his saddle bag. The show features guest stars throughout the three seasons, featured stars include, Lee Van Cleef, Warren Oates, Mary Tyler Moore, Michael Landon, Cloris Leachman, James Coburn, and other reconizable faces. WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE is classic western entertainment of the good ol' days. This is mill creek dvd co. and I won't lie to you, I've watched all eleven disc and there is some occasional freezing and skipping throughout, if there's a better quality set out there I would probably go for that, this is just a cheaper way to see all three seasons, the video is black and white with ""surprisingly"" excellent transfers with clarity, gotta give this four stars despite the quality, for Steve McQueen, Wanted Dead Or Alive, love it, each episode is twenty five minutes, special features include the women who starred with Steve McQueen, the history of the Winchester rifle, the making of the ""mare's leg"". (each disc in this set is one sided, and with separate protective sleeves)",1255478400,31,1618,4.865942028985507
3910777,5,B002DH20PQ,"The multiple DVD set for Wanted Dead or Alive is of excellent video and sound quality - better than it was originally on television.  Wanted Dead or Alive naturally draws comparisons with Have Gun Will Travel.  Everyone has different tastes, but I find Steve McQueen's Josh Randall a more sympathetic and appealing character than the somewhat darker and more cynical Knight Errant Paladin played by Richard Boone. Maybe it's just that Paladin hung out in a luxury hotel between jobs and wore a black hat, while Randall is more of a blue collar working man's bounty hunter.",1254873600,3,572,4.88659793814433

8365244,3,B002DH20PQ,"The series was always a cut above many other westerns with above average scrip writing and guest stars.
The video transfer seems, for the most part, to be good. The problem I experienced was with the sound.
During the opening credits, the sound became very loud where I needed to turn my volume down. Then,
once the episode began, the sound became much lower, forcing me to turn the volume up. It remained that
way until the closing credits where the sound became much louder again and I needed to turn the
volume down. This happened in multiple episodes, so I returned it and got a replacement which did exactly the
same thing. Sad to say, but quality control is not one of Mill Creek's strong points",1494201600,2,701,4.52755905511811
