2521960,5,B000ELJAGA,"If you're a complete Scooby-Doo fan like me, and you like to watch all of the episodes, then this is the DVD for you!  The five episodes on this DVD are (currently) episodes that aren't played often as reruns on TV; instead, earlier episodes are played.  Anyway, so these episodes were a lot of fun for me personally since I hadn't ever seen them, and they are:

Go West Young Scoob - In a western-themed town, robots start to go evil and out of control; so, of course, it's up to the gang to figure out what's going on.

Fright House of a Lighthouse - While visiting Fred's uncle, Mystery Inc. runs across the ghost of the ex-lighthouse keeper, who is haunting the lighthouse and turning off the light when ships are coming to shore.

Farmed and Dangerous - While visiting the Secret Six puppies, everyone is horrified to find out that a demon farmer is trying to scare everyone off the farm.

Gentlemen, Start Your Monsters - When Fred enters a car race the gang has to find out who or what is behind the monster truck that is knocking cars out of the competition one-by-one.

Camp Comeonawannascareya - Shaggy and Scooby are by themselves in this one as counselors at a summer camp where a glowing green toxic monster is terrorizing the campers and wrecking the camp.

Also included on the DVD are various language options, subtitle options, trailers, and three mini-games.  All-in-all, this is a fun DVD with silly episodes from the ""What's New, Scooby Doo?"" collection, and I can highly recommend it to Scooby fans everywhere!

NOTE: In case you didn't know, some of the monsters included in the DVD may be scary to young children who are frightened easily.",1296777600,,1662,4.622448979591836
2521961,5,B000ELJAGA,our whole family loves scoody doo and we are trying to get all the dvds made of him...this is such a neat dvd and the cats love him too.  thanks,1292976000,,144,3.8
2521962,5,B000ELJAGA,"The item was received promptly and in a timely manner.  Well packaged...and it was enjoyed by the four year old.

Thanks",1167782400,,120,4.666666666666667
2521963,5,B000ELJAGA,"What's New Scooby Doo is the updated version of the original Scooby Doo mysteries and I think it is the best. The production value is excellent and, as a father of 3 die hard Scooby fans(and a huge fan myself), I find the updated version of the mystery 5 hysterical. This series is perfect to introduce your children to a show that you loved as a child and you'll probably find yourself having as much fun watching it as your kids!",1161820800,4,431,4.333333333333333
2521964,5,B000ELJAGA,"Like all of the previous ""What's New Scooby Doo?"" DVDs, this one is better than all of the ones before (except Volume 8, they're both great!).

This is DVD contains 5 episodes instead of the usual 4. Here are the following episodes, the monster featured in them, and the grades I give them:

1) ""Go West Young Scoob"" -- Out-of-Control Robots (A+)
2) ""Camp Comeonawannascareya"" -- Toxic Waste Monster (A-)
3) ""Demon Farmer: Farmed and Dangerous"" -- Demon Farmer (A+)
4) ""Fright House of a Lighthouse"" -- A Ghost That Lives In A Lighthouse (A+)
5) ""Gentlemen, Start Your Monsters!"" -- a MONSTER truck & a skeleton driver (A)

Buy this volume, as well as all the other 8 volumes in this DVD collection, because.....Scooby-Doo is the best! Trust me, you'll love - and won't regret it!!!",1149811200,13,782,4.693430656934306
