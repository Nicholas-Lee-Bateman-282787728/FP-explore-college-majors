7991120,2,B00009KUAS,"A decently-acted, well-scripted, well-filmed, but ultimately very disappointing thriller. DARK SIDE follows the formula quite nicely, ending with a brutal fight-to-the-death with some pretty amazing recoveries and a ""twist"" that you will probably see coming if you watch very many of these. Bad pacing: Most of it is spent on corporate lawyer Megan Wright (Janet Kidder) hanging around the apartment of her estranged, recently deceased twin sister (an S & M aficionado), trying to figure out what caused her ""suicide."" Would have been better and more richly layered if Wright had spent more time out in the streets and on the computer, talking to people and picking up factoids that lead to the truth of her sister's death. Some scenes of Kidder naked in the shower in order to spice things up.",1405728000,,794,5.0227272727272725
7991121,1,B00009KUAS,"I saw Victor Garber's ""Torso"" and now this with Jason Priestley.  If these are representative of Canadian films, then they got work to do.  This is the type of stinker that would come on Showtime or Cinemax late, late at night.  The plot is thin.  The S/M background is not titillating or alluring.  Jason Priestley plays a weak-willed guy who could barely speak.  His eyes and chest hair looked nice, but notice that the main actress strips down and he never does.  Like horror movies, the villain takes forever to die. Don't waste your time on this unless you like movies that are thin on almost every aspect.",1152489600,5,611,4.601851851851852
