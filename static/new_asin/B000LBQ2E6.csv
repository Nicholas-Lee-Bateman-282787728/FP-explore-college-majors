8209476,4,B000LBQ2E6,"I've been to Newquay and really just wanted something to take me back there until I get back. I came across this and although it doesn't show as much of the streets of Newquay as I would have liked, it does show alot of the beaches which would make anybody want to go on holiday here because it is a great little place to spend some time. I also wish it was longer than the thirty or so minutes and they also leave Newquay towards the end to head down to ""Land's End"" which is at the bottom of Cornwall quite a way from Newquay (but still a nice place to visit also). The people in this film also spend to much time with the kite surfing bollocks but I enjoy watching it now and then. If you're like me, you want shots of the streets, the people of Newquay, the shops...you know, places you would be going and seeing and this doesn't offer as much of that as it does the beaches and clubs in Newquay. This DVD is more about five 16-22 year olds who have come from around the world to stay in Newquay and shows what they do with their time there. I give it 4 stars because all films trying to show you a place you've never been before should be no less than an hour and include everything their is to see...right. I would have included many things this DVD has not that are so great about Newquay and should have been here but oh well.",1179014400,,1334,4.095419847328245
