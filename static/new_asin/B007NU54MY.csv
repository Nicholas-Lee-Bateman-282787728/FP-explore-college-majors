8519761,3,B007NU54MY,"As so often happens, the category ""noir"" is misapplied here. This set is not noir. Don't buy this  expecting to see (as I did) something wonderful like ""The Stranger on the Third Floor"" which is REAL noir.

This is particularly the case with ""The ""House Across the Street.""  At first, it appears to be a comedy! ... not at all mysterious or eerie. Rather bland.

""Homicide"" was not a noir either , but I liked it. Plot kept me interested and the performances were appealing. So, in my opinion, this was the better of the two.",1377129600,10,525,4.4375
8519762,3,B007NU54MY,"The House Across The Street is a good B film.  It's the old story of a newspaper man going after the town mobster, with a good pace and funny script.  But it's not film noir.  Homicide is also a good B film.  It's a fast moving police procedural drama.  But it's not film noir.  Someone at Warner Bros. has the impression that if the picture is a B and photographed in black and white it is film noir.  Not only is that true in this case, but they have packaged and sold these titles as film noir because they have absolutely no commercial value otherwise.  Seems a dishonest, unethical thing to do, especially when they have so many titles of the real thing yet to be released.  If you're a film buff, go for it.  If you want serious film noir, beware.",1336176000,30,753,4.23943661971831
