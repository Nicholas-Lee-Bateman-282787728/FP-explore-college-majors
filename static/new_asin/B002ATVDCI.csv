8360383,5,B002ATVDCI,Extremely clear quality. If you love to see Michael Palin's face clearly (which I don't specifically) then you're in luck. Worth every penny. Very nice movie. Very nice Tim Curry. Very nice indeed ( ),1423526400,,200,4.742857142857143
8360384,5,B002ATVDCI,"Like another reviewer, I saw this version on PBS. Because it had been on 8 minutes when I got home, I also didn't tape it. I was going to tape it when they repeated it and they didn't. I was heart broken. This version, with Tim Curry, is a hoot. I kept saying to myself, ""I know that voice"" [love Rocky Horror]. I was in stiches.
 I prowl book stores and have 3 or 4 leather copies of the book. I give them as Christmas gifts. It is great. Really great. So I disagree with the reviewer that said this screen adaption isn't as funny. Both are great. I can say that another screen version from a another year didn't come close to Curry and crew. 5 star plus for this movie!",1324166400,5,671,4.083333333333333
8360385,2,B002ATVDCI,"I had high hopes that this mid-70's adaptation would significantly outshine the rather tepid 50's film version of Jerome K. Jerome's hilarious classic, but found instead that I was quite disappointed in it. Bland, slowly paced, and perhaps acted in too understated a manner by nearly the entire cast, it simply fails to do what the novel did....make one laugh out loud. Perhaps the problem lies in trying to adapt to the film medium the nuances and descriptive turn of phrasing that made Jerome such a distinctive and witty author. Whatever the reasons, the film is able to inspire only a few chuckles.
I would unhesitatingly recommend reading the book instead....it is marvelous!",1323388800,,680,5.0265486725663715
8360386,5,B002ATVDCI,I saw this way way back perhaps even in the 70's I think on PBS.  I have wanted a copy ever since and keep looking for it.  I only wish I had the presence of mind to record it on my very primitive VCR at the time... at least I would now have a tape.  But no.  Or perhaps that was even before we had that capability.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a USA format version.  PLEASE?  It is the best humor there ever was.,1315180800,2,411,3.8214285714285716
8360387,5,B002ATVDCI,"Why can't I find this in USA DVD format?  I saw this on Bravo more than a decade ago and I have been looking for it ever since.  I laughed so hard my stomach hurt!  I bought the audio book and my kids (girl, 10 and boy 13) laughed so hard their stomachs hurt!  But the performances in this movie are so perfectly timed and acted!  Someone must make this available to Americans!  Please!  I'm not the only one who's looking for this version.  Check the web.  There are tons of Americans looking for this!  It's timeless humor, not snarky at all.",1301097600,14,544,4.245098039215686
