3070750,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"This is a terrific choice for teachers and small-group leaders. You probably already know the story: Adolf Hitler and a small group of top Nazi officials were so obsessed with art masterpieces that they ""raped"" Europe's cultural heritage during World War II.

This documentary certainly tells that story with vivid film and photography from both the war era and today. The restoration is far from over, even though more than 60 years have passed since the war's end, and we see examples of the dedicated professionals still trying to sort out the mess and restore broken masterpieces.

The themes that are most moving -- and most valuable for discussions -- are the portrayal of the importance of art to everyday men and women in various communities and the stories of individual art historians and volunteers who have made an enormous difference in trying to heal the wounds of the Nazis' destruction.

The film is appropriate for high school classes, as well.",1222732800,4,961,4.956521739130435

3070752,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"I am a huge WW2 buff and I own at least 40-50 documentaries and movies. This is one of the most interesting aspects of WW2 that no one really knows about. You also will not find any other DVDs on this subject. If you are a art and WW2 fan like I am, this movie is heaven. I read most of the book but I found it to be boring. The movie blew away the book as it keeps you tuned in from the beginning to end. The film provides great Nazi footage that even I had not seen and great witness recounts. The length of the movie was perfect and for all I am concerned, it could have been even longer since that I was enjoying it so much. However, it was really sad to see that Warsaw castle was completely destroyed and the amazing frescoes in Italy that were damaged beyond repair. This is definitely a collector's item.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rape-of-Europa/dp/B0011ZJ5C2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rape of Europa</a>",1221091200,28,964,4.813253012048193
3070753,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"This is one film that everyone should see whether they're interested in art or not. It deals with issues that are much deeper than simply the disappearance of significant works of art. It provides interesting insight into the midset and mentality of the Third Reich, shedding light on an aspect of their actions not commonly addressed. That aspect is the significant role of art collecting in the hierarchy and advancement within the Nazi party. One realizes that the mass pillaging of museums and galleries was more than an act of greed, but actually played into a much larger plan and vision that Hitler desperately held on to.

Historically it is fascinating and enlightening, but emotionally it is one of the most moving and touching films I have seen. The combination of footage, personal stories, and historical fact touches and stirs the deepest feelings of humanity and really gets to the core of what it is to be human. While I always understod the devastation Europe suffered at the hands of Hitler, for the first time I FELT the devastation. By far the most moving film I have ever seen.

Everyone must see this film. It is absolutely necessary for really understanding and grasping the consequences of what happened during WWII.",1219795200,7,1240,4.9
3070754,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"As a young man Hilter was an aspiring but mediocre painter. But Hitler's artistic ambitions were thwarted when he was not accepted into the Academy Of Fine Arts in Vienna. Many of those on the admission board were apparently Jewish and some historians blame this rejection as playing an important role in the development of Hitler's rabid anti-Semitism.

This doc begins with a discussion of the Nazi's hatred of modern art, which they considered a ""degenerate"" Jewish form, and their obsession with collecting classical works of art. From there the film proceeds chronologically through the German invasions of Austria, Poland, France and Russia. In each place the Nazis plundered great works of art. Some were taken into private collections, such as the vast number owned by  Hermann Goering, the Nazi's second in command. Others were placed in storage, with Hilter's ultimate goal being to create a massive Fuhrer Museum in his hometown of Linz, Austria.

Fortunately, massive evacuations were undertaken at the Louvre in Paris and the Hermitage in Leningard, which successfully hid numerous works of classic art from theft by the Nazis. But it wasn't only the Germans who did the plundering. The Soviets also engaged in massive looting of German art during their raids on Berlin. Also some Italian art and architecture was destroyed by American bombing. But, to their credit, the Americans also begin sending in Monuments Men who were entrusted with helping preserve art from further destruction and confiscating the works that had being stolen by the Germans.

The film contains a mix of extraordinary archival footage with narration by Joan Allen and interviews with various art historians and others. At close to 2 hours, it is rather long for a documentary and some may find it slow at times. But with it's primary purpose education rather than entertainment, it is best appreciated by those with a strong interest in European art and Nazi atrocities. It is a very well made documentary, however, and comes highly recommeded to those with at least some interest in the subject matter.",1215820800,91,2092,5.108187134502924
3070755,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"Quite simply, this is the best documentary I have seen in the past thirty years.

As an instructor in 20th Century World History I have viewed hundreds of films relating to the Second World War.  This is the primary area I focus upon with my students.

The Rape of Europa is exceptionable film making and is unlike any other documentary both in its outstanding storyline and engaging cinematic presentation.

Well over ninety-percent of the photographic imagery and historical background content was absolutely new to me.

This is a film everyone should view and own in DVD format for their personal or family collection.

I urge every educator to purchase a copy for their classroom, every librarian for their institutional patrons.

3070765,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"The Rape of Europa is a superb documentary.  One of the lesser known tragedies of Adolph Hitler's rampage through Europe between 1939-1945 was the theft or destruction of so much of the art that belonged to the countries occupied by the Third Reich.  Uncounted thousands of pieces of art were stolen from private and public collections or were simply destroyed by the Germans simply because they had the power to do so at that time.  The surviving film, photographs and stories of the efforts of the art custodians in cultural centers like Paris and Saint Petersburg are nothing short of amazing.

One of the better known examples of private art that was stolen and lost for decades was the subject of the excellent 2015 movie ""Woman in Gold.""  That is just one example.",1492387200,,770,4.7593984962406015

The return of the painting by the Utah Museum of Fine Arts to the Seligmann daughter was wonderful to witness and I applaud the museum's decision and action. However, the documentary was all over place and that's one reason I can't give it 5 stars. It was art. It was history. It was plunder. It was excess. It was fat boorish Nazis. It was mattresses and Torah Crowns and suitcases. Also, the ending fell flat. The fate of the Gustav Klimt painting took about 10 seconds onscreen and that event should have been shown in much more detail as it was an important part of a film which ended with a whimper.

Joan Allen should have passed on narrating and given it to someone with a voice that compels you to listen. Painful monotone.",1448755200,,765,4.503597122302159

3070870,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"I read that some people who had seen this documentary before the ""Monuments Men"" movie came out ended up preferring it to Clooney's fictionalized film -- and I'd have to agree.  I had also read the book (""The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History"" by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter) and so I was immersed in the true story, and I found that the movie inadvertently sapped the story of its inherent urgency and excitement by streamlining and fabricating so much.  I think I know why they made the changes they made, and I know how hard those decisions are to make.  I am often on the other side of this argument, insisting that the changes made to a true story actually served the story well in the transition to film, but this time -- not so much.

If you're intrigued by the crazy task of trying to protect art in the middle of a war, check this out.  And if you're open to a very different idea about Hitler's motivation for the actions that brought us into the second world war, you might be tickled by the opening 20 minutes...",1395619200,5,1079,4.402010050251256

The images of the citizens of Paris removing almost all of the art from the Louvre just before Hitler's army marched into that beautiful city will both warm and break your heart.  If you have never seen Paris, if you have never visited the Louvre and gazed in wonder at the Mona Lisa,  the magnificent Winged Victory of Samothrace or the thousands of pieces of art which rest within that wonderful museum, if you have never ascended to the top of the Eiffel Tower and gazed at the City of Paris laid out before you, then this incredible documentary, a work of art within itself, will make you feel as though you have walked the streets, lived its history, been a citizen of France and Europe, at least for a  while.  This film is a remarkable achievement, both in  scope, its lessons of courage in the face of  real danger, of how man sometimes reacts to save himself and those he loves, to save  our history and the art which we  love, all of  which are  such  vital  parts of our lives and our heritage.

The removal of art from countries not their own and in particularly from Jewish families within Germany, Austria and any countries they conquered was celebrated like thriving thugs, criminals. The documentary incorporates a  brief history of the Nazi rise and includes their atrocities such as mass killings in Poland and destruction of selected parts of Warsaw. The striping if their own museums in several countries in advance of the Nazis is quite amazing, hiding the art in various part of the countries not under Nazi control. The broad brush of this documentary includes the allies careful efforts to preserve art and landmarks made more difficult by bombing specific targets and the Nazis use of landmarks to fortify landmarks. The monument men are introduced toward the end of the film and their massive discoveries of art in possession of the Nazis is amazing that includes a deep salt mine in the mountains filled with multi floors of art. And even recent history has found stolen in large quantities in Russia, some returned recently, showing that it was stolen twice and stolen art is still being discovered. Quite astonishing how the Nazi leadership thought of Europe as their art shopping mall, underlining even more how criminal they were. One possible positive was Herman Goering's obsession with his own stolen art collection and the high life of Paris may have been one of the many contributions to the English victory in the aerial battle of a Great Britain.",1392508800,,1738,4.969072164948454

I show the documentary to my art history students and they are stunned. I watch it over and over again and I am stunned. I guess I can never get over what depths of terrible humanity can fall to.
My Grandfather was a drafted attorney during WWII and spent time escorting German POWs and doing various forms of ""paperwork"". He went into Paris at the end of the war.

and stealing Europe's great works of art, along with the allies attempts to spare art during the war, intellectually interesting, but a bit
dry and even repetitive.

But as the film moves on to the aftermath of the war, and we get more of the human side of the story.  Great art treasures are returned
to the lands whose cultures they represent and we see the joy that it brings.  We hear both sides of the Russian debate about keeping
the art they took from Germany as a sort of reparation for the horrible human cost of the war. We see  restorations still going on 60 years
later with care and passion. We get to know a Christian German who has made it his mission to return beautiful and intricate Torah scroll
caps to their rightful Jewish owners. And in the process the film blossoms into a very human examination of just how important art is to
human beings and to our sense of selves.

The first DVD contains the original documentary, which tells the story of the well-organised and premeditated looting of Europe's artistic masterpieces by the Nazis. It's a great and not previously much-aired story, well told. Sometimes it seems like Hitler's desire to steal the best art from across Europe for his own museum was not the least of his reasons for waging war.

The second DVD contains basically extended versions of the interviews edited into the documentary. Some of the extra material thereby aired is a bit tedious, but mostly it adds, usually covering the less art-related side of the stories but often engrossing nonetheless.

The extra content on the third DVD is much more art-related. It ranges from deeper delvings into the repatriation issue and the moral, legal and financial factors involved. For me this evidence of the more distant relatives of the victims of brutal art theft now taking a less public-spirited and more selfish attitude to these works, which should belong to us all, forms a strong contrast to the selfless devotion of the heroes of the film, who I'm sure would not be pleased to know that their efforts have, in some cases, ended in works now languishing in vaults rather than shining out from the walls of museums. These heroes now include those working to protect all our patrimony in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. This last topic is impressively covered on the third disc too. There's also some fascinating background to the Czartoryski Museum, the home of Leonardo's `Lady with an Ermine'.",1361059200,21,1676,4.978571428571429

To this day, there are people everywhere in the world still repairing the damage the Nazi's wrecked on the great Art of the world. I was stunned at what the Nazi's were trying to do to the whole world by even destroying Art that they did not like.
According to this documentary which is based on the book with the same title, the Nazi's did not want their master race to even look at Art that Hitler called ""degenerate art"". He felt that it would not be a good influence on his pure Aryans. The Nazi'z burned thousands of paintings.
I especially enjoyed the comments from the Russian curators of the Hermitage about why they decided to keep a lot of the Art that the Nazi's had stolen.
And I admired the great efforts of the Americans to recover most of the Art that the Nazi's looted that numbered into the hundreds of thousands.

It is a blessing in disguise that Hitler liked art and he knew its value; otherwise, instead of plundering it, he would have probably destroyed it alongwith all the buildings that he did.

Big thanks to America for playing an important role in recovering hundreds of tons of art work and returning it to their native lands.

What is disappointing is when the Red army of the former USSR chased the Germany army, it stole German art, which is currently hanging in Pushkin Museum.  The reason a Russian interior minster gave was that it is not immoral to keep German art in lieu of a million people Leningrad alone lost in the WWII caused by Germany. Hope the art work will ultimately rest where it is supposed to be!  Say ""no"" to stealing of art... and anything else.

As soon as I viewed it, I ordered my own copy and now I loan it to friends on a regular basis; it is riveting!

The ""Rape"" in the title is actually twofold: The first is the shameless plundering of art from all over Europe by Nazi Germany; the second is the struggle by the Allies to win the war without inflicting any further damage to the treasure troves in French, Italian, Dutch, Belgian, German, Austrian and Russian cities, churches and museums.

As we watch the gargantuan tasks assumed by Allied servicemen to find, catalog, restore and return mind-boggling numbers of priceless artifacts, we become as involved and invested in their success as they were. This sounds like a pretty unlikely topic for an entire movie, but trust me, it is engrossing from beginning to end!

I had traveled to some of the locations in Florence and was surprised to find out that much of the artwork, including Ghiberti's bronze doors on the Florence Cathedral, had been shipped out during the war.

Particularly compelling is the story of struggle by Maria Altmann, a beautiful and elegant 90-year-old, whose aunt was Adele Bloch. The Bloch family commissioned Klimt to paint the portrait, yet it, along with several other Klimt paintings, was stolen from her family home by the Nazis in 1938. The painting was hanging in the Austrian National Gallery for years, as the Austrians consider it their ""Mona Lisa."" Through sheer will and determination, and a bit of luck, Altmann finally obtained ownership of her aunt's portrait and the other pieces.

That is the subject of this outstanding documentary. It happened in eastern Europe by the Nazi & later the Soviets & to lesser extent in western Europe. Art objects & icons of civilizations were simply wantonly destroyed. Unless these criminals could enrich themselves simply by stealing what could be carried away. The Russian were complicent in this pillaging. Remember they were allies of the Nazis in the early years of World War II. Eastern Europe especially Poland was raped twice. Once by the Nazis & then by the advancing Russian Army as the Germans retreated later in the war. This discussion is not centered on the millions of people that were exterminated. You can never  minimize that. But those people left behind art of exquisite beauty & value, not only monetary but to the world itself. Much documentation is surfacing recently as to original ownership of this property be it nations or individuals. Of some interest was the attempts of various conquered people in western Europe who had more time to hide their treasures from the Germans. The entire collection of the Lourve in Paris was removed & hidden throughout France. The Allies who liberated Europe were not blameless as members of the military were able ro smuggle ""spoils of war"", home. Even the United States itself sent shiploads of art objects back to the states for ""safekeeping"". I trust that much of that will & is being returned to its rightful owners. Time is really no barrier with the technolgy we have today. Many of these works have already lasted 1,000 years.

3070972,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"The movie is aptly titled ""The Rape of Europe"" - the war and the conflicts led the Germans, Americans, and Russians to destroy each others' art and cultural heritages.

I am an avid art historian, and I am grateful this documentary was made.  It recounts many atrocities of Hitler's ravages across Europe.  Unquestionably, Hitler and the Germans systematically stole or destroyed art and culture from others.  It is important for future generations to remember the immeasurable harm that came from the Nazis' conquest to attempt to achieve their vision of a larger and richer German empire, an empire that was built on the false moral premises that they were racially superior and it was acceptable for them to steal from racially-inferior people.

Other reviewers have warrantedly criticized this documentary for not equally reporting on the American and Russian destruction of their adversaries' art and cultural buildings.  There are a few accounts of American and Russian carpet bombings.  There are specific accounts of American attempts to avoid unnecessarily destroying some of their adversaires' cities and structures, but this documentary appears to have primarily a pro-allies perspective.  I wish the documentary had accounted more of the allied atrocities.  This war led all the nations involved to commit unbearable horrors against each other.  World War II eventually led all the nations involved to participate in a rape of European arts, civility, and cultures.",1236211200,,1477,5.3826086956521735
3070973,3,B0011ZJ5C2,"The Rape of Europa recounts the story of Hitler's rejection from the Vienna School of Art and suggests that because he failed to get into art school he made the plundering of art a priority during WWII.

Without a doubt, Hitler was a thief. But I think it's a mistake to link these events as causal. Hitler stole everything he could get his hands on to pay for WWII. Property, gold-even the hair of concentration camp prisoners to stuff pillows. As a painter he could appreciate fine art, but as a dictator he knew it's value to the Third Reich. The removal and dessimation of cultural symbols played upon enemies psychologically. This movie almost has you believing that Hitler WENT to war to build a personal art collection. It's like saying Hitler's bumpy complexion in his teenage years later led to the practice of taking the skin of concentration camp victims to cover lamp shades. One event doesn't necessarily lead to another. It's a little absurd when more rational explanations are available for his actions-greed, a thirst for power, xenophobia, unpaid war bills.

The Rape of Europa also fails to address some important points in the taking of art from Jews during WWII. The Widelstein Family and many art collectors in the South of France helped Hitler move parts of his collection for money-and these people were Jewish. In other words, without the help of Jews some of this wouldn't have happened. In fact, many of the art works that remain unaccounted for were moved through the Widelstein family whereas the art that remained in Germany or with Hitler was repatriated to its righful owners. There is an interesting psychology in this. And as others reviewers have pointed out, what about the bombing of Dresden? This movie goes to great lengths to discuss the allied attempt to delay the bombing of the Cassino Abbey in Italy and discusses the allies appointing a special unit to restore art works to their original origins, but fails to address the other side. There was too much assigning of blame and heroism in this movie. The reality is that ART and culture are victims of war and everyone who choses to go to war is responsible for the demise of beauty. You want to believe the premise of the Rape of Europa, but the reality is Hitler didn't steal art because he was rejected from art school. Hitler took everything of value-dignity, humanity, art, gold, wine, women, children, body & soul-from anyone and everyone because it was a way of amassing power. This is what dictators do.",1235692800,29,2504,4.780600461893765
3070974,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"During World War II, the Nazi regime systematically plundered the great art in countries and cities they occupied.  ""The Rape of Europa"" documents the staggering extent of this theft.  Starting in Poland and continuing throughout Europe, Hitler cherry-picked artwork he liked and had it shipped to Germany, where it was hidden in country-side chateaus and salt mines.  The Nazis would first take the art of Jews sent to concentration camps, and then they gradually moved on to seize art from national museums.  Much of what Hitler didn't like, including Modern Art and works of art by Jews, was destroyed or sold on the cheap.  Just as he viewed Jews and others as subhuman, Hitler branded this art as unworthy.  As the Allies attempted to recapture territory, the bombing destroyed much art, particularly monuments, and the retreating Nazis would often purposefully burn or bomb what remained.  The result was the raping of European art that took decades to sort out and begin to rectify.  Much art went missing, either destroyed or still hidden somewhere in Europe; however, some of these works occasionally surface.

""The Rape of Europa"" is well-constructed with excellent narration by Joan Allen.  Piecing together interviews with witnesses and clips from the war, this riveting documentary also considers the moral dilemmas that have arisen from this stolen art, some of which continue to the present.  For example, a painting stolen from a Jewish family was discovered a few years ago in a small Utah art museum.  In a moving ceremony, the museum returned the painting to the rightful owner.  However, not all recovered art has been treated similarly, which has resulted in bitter court and political fights.  Obviously, the loss of art cannot be compared to the loss of life suffered during the war, but it's an important topic that adds to the tapestry of information available about WWII.

Hitler's role is significant here - it was interesting to find out that he was not accepted into the prestigious Viennese art institute and the question as to whether this led to his intense hatred of Jews[ many of the members of the selection committee were Jewish].

Hitler's art tastes were rooted in Social Realism and Germanic art and we also learn that he was, predictably, repulsed by works by Jewish artists, modernists such as Picasso and also Slavic art [as the Slavs were deemed sub-human, and in fact were targeted for extinction after the Jews].

A lot of ground is covered here in this documentary - we witness the evacuation of the Louvre's art treasures [how the Mona Lisa was saved, the fragile Winged Victory moved down a flight of steps etc] and also how ordinary people went to extraordinary lengths to help protect and safeguard these precious works of art.

And then he had to abandon them again when he was forced to another location with no belongings. I'd never seen any of this actual film from the various German-occupied cities. Whether you're an art buff, a history fiend...or both, you will not lose interest from start to finish.",1229126400,,743,4.511111111111111
3070983,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"This film focuses on an aspect of World War II that is often missed, which is the massive systematic theft of the art treasures of Europe by the Nazis. Adolph Hitler, a frustrated artist, brought the considerable forces of the Third Reich to not only produce the Holocaust, but to engage in massive theft of art which he admired and the destruction of art and culture which he despised.

In the film, we learn of Hitler's ambitions as an artist and his philosophy of art and imagery. Social Realism eventually became his primary focus, and he supported German artists who portrayed the German people as idealistic, beautiful, god-like family-loving creatures. He also knew what he did not like, which was works by Jews and works influenced by the modernist movement. He supported an exhibition of degenerate art pulled from Germany's museums and sold at bargain basement prices after the show.  These include the works of Edvard Munch, Emile Nolde, Max Beckman, Kathe Kollwitz, Egon Schiele, Arnold Schoenberg, Paul Klee, Piet Mondrian, and Vassily Kandinsky.

The film also takes us into the surreal world of drug addicted Hermann Goering, the second most powerful man in Germany.  Goering stole art at a terrific rate, collecting over 1700 masterpiece works of art in his mountain hunting lodge alone.

As Germany invades Poland, we see the destruction of great Slavic treasures by the Nazi front line troops. The Slavic people were judged to be inferior to the Germans and thus Hitler could care less about preservation of their heritage.

The evacuation of the Louvre was a spectacular part of the film, demonstrating the commitment, creativity, and bravery of the French people in taking all the art from the Louvre and hiding it in the French countryside. The story of the packaging and hiding of the Winged Victory was an inspiration. The story is told of a young French woman clerk who works in the Jeaux de Paume which the Nazis used as a storehouse for the French art they were able to obtain to ship back to Germany. This young woman did not let the German's know that she could read and write German and thus she was able to learn where many art works had been stolen and where they had been sent. Each day when she went home she wrote in a personal diary everything she could remember about the thefts and their destinations which she learned from reading labels on crates. What a wonderful film this true episode might make.

The invasion of Russia threatened the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. Like the Louvre, the people endured great hardship to hide and protect the art treasures of Russia.

General Eisenhower created the Monuments Men, a group of artists and art historians that advised on war maneuvers so as to produce the least amount of harm and destruction when fighting the Nazis and driving them out of Greece, Italy, and France. The story of the Monuments Men also would make a fantastic stand alone film.

The film focuses on the Gustav Klimt painting of a portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, a wealthy Jewish patron of the arts in Vienna. The controversy over this painting was fascinating, including how to interpret a will written in a happier time.

The tragedies of the destruction of the Monastery of Monte Cassino, the Renaissance bridge in Florence, and the Capisanto in Pisa were well explained.

Overall the film is excellent and is a testimony of how great art is an inspiration to a nation and how the people of free nations will sacrifice for the preservation of their cultural heritage.",1228435200,4,3522,4.833887043189368

This documentary certainly tells that story with vivid film and photography from both the war era and today. The restoration is far from over, even though more than 60 years have passed since the war's end, and we see examples of the dedicated professionals still trying to sort out the mess and restore broken masterpieces.

The themes that are most moving -- and most valuable for discussions -- are the portrayal of the importance of art to everyday men and women in various communities and the stories of individual art historians and volunteers who have made an enormous difference in trying to heal the wounds of the Nazis' destruction.

3305250,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"This is one film that everyone should see whether they're interested in art or not. It deals with issues that are much deeper than simply the disappearance of significant works of art. It provides interesting insight into the midset and mentality of the Third Reich, shedding light on an aspect of their actions not commonly addressed. That aspect is the significant role of art collecting in the hierarchy and advancement within the Nazi party. One realizes that the mass pillaging of museums and galleries was more than an act of greed, but actually played into a much larger plan and vision that Hitler desperately held on to.

Historically it is fascinating and enlightening, but emotionally it is one of the most moving and touching films I have seen. The combination of footage, personal stories, and historical fact touches and stirs the deepest feelings of humanity and really gets to the core of what it is to be human. While I always understod the devastation Europe suffered at the hands of Hitler, for the first time I FELT the devastation. By far the most moving film I have ever seen.

3305251,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"As a young man Hilter was an aspiring but mediocre painter. But Hitler's artistic ambitions were thwarted when he was not accepted into the Academy Of Fine Arts in Vienna. Many of those on the admission board were apparently Jewish and some historians blame this rejection as playing an important role in the development of Hitler's rabid anti-Semitism.

This doc begins with a discussion of the Nazi's hatred of modern art, which they considered a ""degenerate"" Jewish form, and their obsession with collecting classical works of art. From there the film proceeds chronologically through the German invasions of Austria, Poland, France and Russia. In each place the Nazis plundered great works of art. Some were taken into private collections, such as the vast number owned by  Hermann Goering, the Nazi's second in command. Others were placed in storage, with Hilter's ultimate goal being to create a massive Fuhrer Museum in his hometown of Linz, Austria.

Fortunately, massive evacuations were undertaken at the Louvre in Paris and the Hermitage in Leningard, which successfully hid numerous works of classic art from theft by the Nazis. But it wasn't only the Germans who did the plundering. The Soviets also engaged in massive looting of German art during their raids on Berlin. Also some Italian art and architecture was destroyed by American bombing. But, to their credit, the Americans also begin sending in Monuments Men who were entrusted with helping preserve art from further destruction and confiscating the works that had being stolen by the Germans.

The film contains a mix of extraordinary archival footage with narration by Joan Allen and interviews with various art historians and others. At close to 2 hours, it is rather long for a documentary and some may find it slow at times. But with it's primary purpose education rather than entertainment, it is best appreciated by those with a strong interest in European art and Nazi atrocities. It is a very well made documentary, however, and comes highly recommeded to those with at least some interest in the subject matter.",1215820800,91,2092,5.108187134502924

The surviving film, photographs and stories of the efforts of the art custodians in cultural centers like Paris and Saint Petersburg are nothing short of amazing.

Their work on behalf of the Allies saved so much art and artifacts that we probably would have lost to the Nazi's.,1433462400,,327,4.125

I happened one time when I couldn't get it back at all (no issue with connection) and then again on a different device the same thing happened.

3305337,5,B0011ZJ5C2,excellent documentary showing the horrible acquisition of art by the Nazis as they goose stepped across Europe. Much of the art confiscated was eventually damaged or destroyed as the fate of the 3rd Reich became clear. Many of the artworks owned by Jewish families and held by countries conquered by the Nazis are lost to the world and those losses are tragic. The group of American G.I.s who was tasked with trying to find the art and restore it to the rightful owners were true heroes. Another surprising hero was a woman in Paris who made careful notes of all the works the Nazis stole from the Louvre and Paris. Her documentation done in secret helped many of the masterpieces return to their rightful owners.,1407801600,,713,4.712

3305367,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"I read that some people who had seen this documentary before the ""Monuments Men"" movie came out ended up preferring it to Clooney's fictionalized film -- and I'd have to agree.  I had also read the book (""The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History"" by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter) and so I was immersed in the true story, and I found that the movie inadvertently sapped the story of its inherent urgency and excitement by streamlining and fabricating so much.  I think I know why they made the changes they made, and I know how hard those decisions are to make.  I am often on the other side of this argument, insisting that the changes made to a true story actually served the story well in the transition to film, but this time -- not so much.

If you're intrigued by the crazy task of trying to protect art in the middle of a war, check this out.  And if you're open to a very different idea about Hitler's motivation for the actions that brought us into the second world war, you might be tickled by the opening 20 minutes...",1395619200,5,1079,4.402010050251256

The images of the citizens of Paris removing almost all of the art from the Louvre just before Hitler's army marched into that beautiful city will both warm and break your heart.  If you have never seen Paris, if you have never visited the Louvre and gazed in wonder at the Mona Lisa,  the magnificent Winged Victory of Samothrace or the thousands of pieces of art which rest within that wonderful museum, if you have never ascended to the top of the Eiffel Tower and gazed at the City of Paris laid out before you, then this incredible documentary, a work of art within itself, will make you feel as though you have walked the streets, lived its history, been a citizen of France and Europe, at least for a  while.  This film is a remarkable achievement, both in  scope, its lessons of courage in the face of  real danger, of how man sometimes reacts to save himself and those he loves, to save  our history and the art which we  love, all of  which are  such  vital  parts of our lives and our heritage.

The removal of art from countries not their own and in particularly from Jewish families within Germany, Austria and any countries they conquered was celebrated like thriving thugs, criminals. The documentary incorporates a  brief history of the Nazi rise and includes their atrocities such as mass killings in Poland and destruction of selected parts of Warsaw. The striping if their own museums in several countries in advance of the Nazis is quite amazing, hiding the art in various part of the countries not under Nazi control. The broad brush of this documentary includes the allies careful efforts to preserve art and landmarks made more difficult by bombing specific targets and the Nazis use of landmarks to fortify landmarks. The monument men are introduced toward the end of the film and their massive discoveries of art in possession of the Nazis is amazing that includes a deep salt mine in the mountains filled with multi floors of art. And even recent history has found stolen in large quantities in Russia, some returned recently, showing that it was stolen twice and stolen art is still being discovered. Quite astonishing how the Nazi leadership thought of Europe as their art shopping mall, underlining even more how criminal they were. One possible positive was Herman Goering's obsession with his own stolen art collection and the high life of Paris may have been one of the many contributions to the English victory in the aerial battle of a Great Britain.",1392508800,,1738,4.969072164948454

dry and even repetitive.

But as the film moves on to the aftermath of the war, and we get more of the human side of the story.  Great art treasures are returned
to the lands whose cultures they represent and we see the joy that it brings.  We hear both sides of the Russian debate about keeping
the art they took from Germany as a sort of reparation for the horrible human cost of the war. We see  restorations still going on 60 years
later with care and passion. We get to know a Christian German who has made it his mission to return beautiful and intricate Torah scroll
caps to their rightful Jewish owners. And in the process the film blossoms into a very human examination of just how important art is to
human beings and to our sense of selves.

3305442,4,B0011ZJ5C2,"I am writing this for people interested in the Collector's Edition and wondering what the stuff on the other two DVDs consist of.

The first DVD contains the original documentary, which tells the story of the well-organised and premeditated looting of Europe's artistic masterpieces by the Nazis. It's a great and not previously much-aired story, well told. Sometimes it seems like Hitler's desire to steal the best art from across Europe for his own museum was not the least of his reasons for waging war.

The second DVD contains basically extended versions of the interviews edited into the documentary. Some of the extra material thereby aired is a bit tedious, but mostly it adds, usually covering the less art-related side of the stories but often engrossing nonetheless.

The extra content on the third DVD is much more art-related. It ranges from deeper delvings into the repatriation issue and the moral, legal and financial factors involved. For me this evidence of the more distant relatives of the victims of brutal art theft now taking a less public-spirited and more selfish attitude to these works, which should belong to us all, forms a strong contrast to the selfless devotion of the heroes of the film, who I'm sure would not be pleased to know that their efforts have, in some cases, ended in works now languishing in vaults rather than shining out from the walls of museums. These heroes now include those working to protect all our patrimony in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. This last topic is impressively covered on the third disc too. There's also some fascinating background to the Czartoryski Museum, the home of Leonardo's `Lady with an Ermine'.",1361059200,21,1676,4.978571428571429

To this day, there are people everywhere in the world still repairing the damage the Nazi's wrecked on the great Art of the world. I was stunned at what the Nazi's were trying to do to the whole world by even destroying Art that they did not like.
According to this documentary which is based on the book with the same title, the Nazi's did not want their master race to even look at Art that Hitler called ""degenerate art"". He felt that it would not be a good influence on his pure Aryans. The Nazi'z burned thousands of paintings.
I especially enjoyed the comments from the Russian curators of the Hermitage about why they decided to keep a lot of the Art that the Nazi's had stolen.
And I admired the great efforts of the Americans to recover most of the Art that the Nazi's looted that numbered into the hundreds of thousands.

Big thanks to America for playing an important role in recovering hundreds of tons of art work and returning it to their native lands.

What is disappointing is when the Red army of the former USSR chased the Germany army, it stole German art, which is currently hanging in Pushkin Museum.  The reason a Russian interior minster gave was that it is not immoral to keep German art in lieu of a million people Leningrad alone lost in the WWII caused by Germany.

The ""Rape"" in the title is actually twofold: The first is the shameless plundering of art from all over Europe by Nazi Germany; the second is the struggle by the Allies to win the war without inflicting any further damage to the treasure troves in French, Italian, Dutch, Belgian, German, Austrian and Russian cities, churches and museums.

As we watch the gargantuan tasks assumed by Allied servicemen to find, catalog, restore and return mind-boggling numbers of priceless artifacts, we become as involved and invested in their success as they were.

I had traveled to some of the locations in Florence and was surprised to find out that much of the artwork, including Ghiberti's bronze doors on the Florence Cathedral, had been shipped out during the war.

Particularly compelling is the story of struggle by Maria Altmann, a beautiful and elegant 90-year-old, whose aunt was Adele Bloch. The Bloch family commissioned Klimt to paint the portrait, yet it, along with several other Klimt paintings, was stolen from her family home by the Nazis in 1938. The painting was hanging in the Austrian National Gallery for years, as the Austrians consider it their ""Mona Lisa."" Through sheer will and determination, and a bit of luck, Altmann finally obtained ownership of her aunt's portrait and the other pieces.

That is the subject of this outstanding documentary. It happened in eastern Europe by the Nazi & later the Soviets & to lesser extent in western Europe. Art objects & icons of civilizations were simply wantonly destroyed. Unless these criminals could enrich themselves simply by stealing what could be carried away. The Russian were complicent in this pillaging. Remember they were allies of the Nazis in the early years of World War II. Eastern Europe especially Poland was raped twice. Once by the Nazis & then by the advancing Russian Army as the Germans retreated later in the war. This discussion is not centered on the millions of people that were exterminated. You can never  minimize that. But those people left behind art of exquisite beauty & value, not only monetary but to the world itself. Much documentation is surfacing recently as to original ownership of this property be it nations or individuals. Of some interest was the attempts of various conquered people in western Europe who had more time to hide their treasures from the Germans. The entire collection of the Lourve in Paris was removed & hidden throughout France. The Allies who liberated Europe were not blameless as members of the military were able ro smuggle ""spoils of war"", home. Even the United States itself sent shiploads of art objects back to the states for ""safekeeping"". I trust that much of that will & is being returned to its rightful owners. Time is really no barrier with the technolgy we have today. Many of these works have already lasted 1,000 years.

I am an avid art historian, and I am grateful this documentary was made.  It recounts many atrocities of Hitler's ravages across Europe.  Unquestionably, Hitler and the Germans systematically stole or destroyed art and culture from others.  It is important for future generations to remember the immeasurable harm that came from the Nazis' conquest to attempt to achieve their vision of a larger and richer German empire, an empire that was built on the false moral premises that they were racially superior and it was acceptable for them to steal from racially-inferior people.

Other reviewers have warrantedly criticized this documentary for not equally reporting on the American and Russian destruction of their adversaries' art and cultural buildings.  There are a few accounts of American and Russian carpet bombings.  There are specific accounts of American attempts to avoid unnecessarily destroying some of their adversaires' cities and structures, but this documentary appears to have primarily a pro-allies perspective.  I wish the documentary had accounted more of the allied atrocities.  This war led all the nations involved to commit unbearable horrors against each other.

3305470,3,B0011ZJ5C2,"The Rape of Europa recounts the story of Hitler's rejection from the Vienna School of Art and suggests that because he failed to get into art school he made the plundering of art a priority during WWII.

Without a doubt, Hitler was a thief. But I think it's a mistake to link these events as causal. Hitler stole everything he could get his hands on to pay for WWII. Property, gold-even the hair of concentration camp prisoners to stuff pillows. As a painter he could appreciate fine art, but as a dictator he knew it's value to the Third Reich. The removal and dessimation of cultural symbols played upon enemies psychologically. This movie almost has you believing that Hitler WENT to war to build a personal art collection. It's like saying Hitler's bumpy complexion in his teenage years later led to the practice of taking the skin of concentration camp victims to cover lamp shades. One event doesn't necessarily lead to another. It's a little absurd when more rational explanations are available for his actions-greed, a thirst for power, xenophobia, unpaid war bills.

The Rape of Europa also fails to address some important points in the taking of art from Jews during WWII. The Widelstein Family and many art collectors in the South of France helped Hitler move parts of his collection for money-and these people were Jewish. In other words, without the help of Jews some of this wouldn't have happened. In fact, many of the art works that remain unaccounted for were moved through the Widelstein family whereas the art that remained in Germany or with Hitler was repatriated to its righful owners. There is an interesting psychology in this. And as others reviewers have pointed out, what about the bombing of Dresden? This movie goes to great lengths to discuss the allied attempt to delay the bombing of the Cassino Abbey in Italy and discusses the allies appointing a special unit to restore art works to their original origins, but fails to address the other side. There was too much assigning of blame and heroism in this movie. The reality is that ART and culture are victims of war and everyone who choses to go to war is responsible for the demise of beauty. You want to believe the premise of the Rape of Europa, but the reality is Hitler didn't steal art because he was rejected from art school. Hitler took everything of value-dignity, humanity, art, gold, wine, women, children, body & soul-from anyone and everyone because it was a way of amassing power. This is what dictators do.",1235692800,29,2504,4.780600461893765
3305471,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"During World War II, the Nazi regime systematically plundered the great art in countries and cities they occupied.  ""The Rape of Europa"" documents the staggering extent of this theft.  Starting in Poland and continuing throughout Europe, Hitler cherry-picked artwork he liked and had it shipped to Germany, where it was hidden in country-side chateaus and salt mines.  The Nazis would first take the art of Jews sent to concentration camps, and then they gradually moved on to seize art from national museums.  Much of what Hitler didn't like, including Modern Art and works of art by Jews, was destroyed or sold on the cheap.  Just as he viewed Jews and others as subhuman, Hitler branded this art as unworthy.  As the Allies attempted to recapture territory, the bombing destroyed much art, particularly monuments, and the retreating Nazis would often purposefully burn or bomb what remained.  The result was the raping of European art that took decades to sort out and begin to rectify.  Much art went missing, either destroyed or still hidden somewhere in Europe; however, some of these works occasionally surface.

""The Rape of Europa"" is well-constructed with excellent narration by Joan Allen.  Piecing together interviews with witnesses and clips from the war, this riveting documentary also considers the moral dilemmas that have arisen from this stolen art, some of which continue to the present.  For example, a painting stolen from a Jewish family was discovered a few years ago in a small Utah art museum.  In a moving ceremony, the museum returned the painting to the rightful owner.  However, not all recovered art has been treated similarly, which has resulted in bitter court and political fights.  Obviously, the loss of art cannot be compared to the loss of life suffered during the war, but it's an important topic that adds to the tapestry of information available about WWII.  A real must for those interested in art or WWII.",1234569600,,1947,5.040625

3305474,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"This set of 3 DVD's is an extraordinary humpty- dumpty story of the great art of Europe and the horses and men who eventually put most of it all back together again.  I was mesmerized by the many hours of eye witness reports that documented this horror.  The only criticism I have is that the first DVD, a complete copy of the television documentary of the same name, has no ""chapters"" so that it must be watched in its entirety in one sitting.  If it is turned off at any point it must be started again at the beginning.  The other two discs, being the ""out-takes"" from the program itself, are presented in chapter form so that starting and stopping is a definite option, as is the ability to pick and choose what to see and in what order.  I wholeheartedly recommend that all persons who have any interest in art, or WWII or the convoluted minds of the leaders of the 3rd Reich view this collection.",1232064000,4,901,4.37125748502994

Having read many books and watched many films and documentaries on WWII, this was the first time I truly learned to the extent that Art played a role in this war.  When the program ended, I immediately looked it up on line and ordered it for my mother as a Christmas gift.  She absolutely loved it and has since made her grandchildren watch it and anyone else she can convince to watch it as well.  She now wants to join me on my impending trip to Florence and Paris to witness first hand the subjects of much turmoil, secrecy, and painstaking efforts to save Europe's great art.  This is a must for all College Art Appreciation courses as well.

It fails to account for contemporary German artists (and socialists) expelled from Germany, and it does not explain the bombing of DRESDEN by the USA.  How can you have such a major work on European Art and the protection of its destruction and speak NOTHING about Germany's greatest ART CENTER Desden???  I would have bought most of what this documentry sold me but for its omission of Dresden.  Given the cultural wealth Dresden sacrificed for the opposition to win the war it is SHAMEFUL this film failed to mention it.  Was it because Americans DECIMATED German Art History for no reason at all?  Was it because Dresden art had a story to tell? ... affirmed some of the German work of the time artworthy or anti-fascist? ... implicated somebody? .... concealed evidence?",1230768000,5,950,4.7975460122699385

3305478,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"A friend recommended this documentary and I was truly fascinated by the details presented as to how the Nazis systematically stole art treasures from parts of occupied Europe and decimated those they deemed unworthy. Hitler's role is significant here - it was interesting to find out that he was not accepted into the prestigious Viennese art institute and the question as to whether this led to his intense hatred of Jews[ many of the members of the selection committee were Jewish].

Hitler's art tastes were rooted in Social Realism and Germanic art and we also learn that he was, predictably, repulsed by works by Jewish artists, modernists such as Picasso and also Slavic art [as the Slavs were deemed sub-human, and in fact were targeted for extinction after the Jews].

A lot of ground is covered here in this documentary - we witness the evacuation of the Louvre's art treasures [how the Mona Lisa was saved, the fragile Winged Victory moved down a flight of steps etc] and also how ordinary people went to extraordinary lengths to help protect and safeguard these precious works of art.

All in all, this is an excellent historical documentary that will appeal to those with an interest in history and art.",1229299200,,1215,4.859903381642512

He grabbed an old suitcase to hold photos of his young father and girlish mother. There was a photo of their wedding. And then he had to abandon them again when he was forced to another location with no belongings. I'd never seen any of this actual film from the various German-occupied cities. Whether you're an art buff, a history fiend...or both, you will not lose interest from start to finish.",1229126400,,743,4.511111111111111
3305480,5,B0011ZJ5C2,"This film focuses on an aspect of World War II that is often missed, which is the massive systematic theft of the art treasures of Europe by the Nazis. Adolph Hitler, a frustrated artist, brought the considerable forces of the Third Reich to not only produce the Holocaust, but to engage in massive theft of art which he admired and the destruction of art and culture which he despised.

In the film, we learn of Hitler's ambitions as an artist and his philosophy of art and imagery. Social Realism eventually became his primary focus, and he supported German artists who portrayed the German people as idealistic, beautiful, god-like family-loving creatures. He also knew what he did not like, which was works by Jews and works influenced by the modernist movement. He supported an exhibition of degenerate art pulled from Germany's museums and sold at bargain basement prices after the show.  These include the works of Edvard Munch, Emile Nolde, Max Beckman, Kathe Kollwitz, Egon Schiele, Arnold Schoenberg, Paul Klee, Piet Mondrian, and Vassily Kandinsky.

The film also takes us into the surreal world of drug addicted Hermann Goering, the second most powerful man in Germany.  Goering stole art at a terrific rate, collecting over 1700 masterpiece works of art in his mountain hunting lodge alone.

As Germany invades Poland, we see the destruction of great Slavic treasures by the Nazi front line troops. The Slavic people were judged to be inferior to the Germans and thus Hitler could care less about preservation of their heritage.

The evacuation of the Louvre was a spectacular part of the film, demonstrating the commitment, creativity, and bravery of the French people in taking all the art from the Louvre and hiding it in the French countryside. The story of the packaging and hiding of the Winged Victory was an inspiration. The story is told of a young French woman clerk who works in the Jeaux de Paume which the Nazis used as a storehouse for the French art they were able to obtain to ship back to Germany. This young woman did not let the German's know that she could read and write German and thus she was able to learn where many art works had been stolen and where they had been sent. Each day when she went home she wrote in a personal diary everything she could remember about the thefts and their destinations which she learned from reading labels on crates. What a wonderful film this true episode might make.

The invasion of Russia threatened the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. Like the Louvre, the people endured great hardship to hide and protect the art treasures of Russia.

General Eisenhower created the Monuments Men, a group of artists and art historians that advised on war maneuvers so as to produce the least amount of harm and destruction when fighting the Nazis and driving them out of Greece, Italy, and France. The story of the Monuments Men also would make a fantastic stand alone film.

The film focuses on the Gustav Klimt painting of a portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, a wealthy Jewish patron of the arts in Vienna. The controversy over this painting was fascinating, including how to interpret a will written in a happier time.

The tragedies of the destruction of the Monastery of Monte Cassino, the Renaissance bridge in Florence, and the Capisanto in Pisa were well explained.

Overall the film is excellent and is a testimony of how great art is an inspiration to a nation and how the people of free nations will sacrifice for the preservation of their cultural heritage.",1228435200,4,3522,4.833887043189368
