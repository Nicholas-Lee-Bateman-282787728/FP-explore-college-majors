8327486,4,B001NOBH68,"This was a doc i was on the fence about watching, but I've always been curious about body images so i thought i would give it a try. I'm really glad i did! This is a great little doc that wasn't overdone the way some others are with too much blurred video and weird transitional sequences that quickly become irritating...or maybe i didn't notice because the characters themselves were so interesting! For those that get a bit skiddish with the idea of nudity, don't worry- it's not a bunch of naked people frolicking around for no reason. Each one has a story to tell and an issue with their body, and the small bits of nudity that ARE there make you feel closer to the subject, instead of making you recoil. I think that was the aim of the director, so i would say it's quite well done. :)",1274659200,,791,4.315436241610739

8327488,3,B001NOBH68,"Kim Farrant directs this documentary, which explores society's perception on body images.  She interviews 6 people from around the world and she tries to convince them to shed their clothes.

The interviewees are:
Dave - a dance for a British dance troupe; is amputated from the upper legs
Carre- a former model who stopped modeling after a heart seizure due to her strict diet and eventually became suicidal
Marcus- a pre-op transgender who teaches Sunday school in Taiwan
Rick- an artist and a mother of two children; had stage 4 breast cancer which resulted in a mastectomy...she believes this was brought on from guilt from a secret, which was an affair
Shirley- is fat (350 pounds) and is part of a fat-women synchronized swimming team
Jose- a former gang member who was shot in the head 4 times and survived; he was shot after seeking revenge to those responsible who killed his girlfriend and son

Each of the interviewees share their life story.  Towards the end of their interview, they have been convinced to shed their clothes for the camera.  As they shed, they share their personal perception on their body image.

I'm not sure what's Farrant's point of this documentary since only a small number of people were interviewed...other than to see if these people with an ""imperfect"" body were comfortable with their naked self.",1231804800,,1337,4.893805309734513
