I STILL MISS THE VOICE OF FIRESTONE AND THE TELEPHONE HOUR. BUT THEY PRESERVED A GOLDEN ERA FOR TODAY.  -- A VERY GRATFUL VIEWER.",1202428800,,361,4.159420289855072
7953790,5,B00005TPNA,"Elesnor Steber was one of the few Americans at the Met during the 40's and was, unfortunately, never fully utilized.  A regular on the Firestone Program, here she sings mostly in English (her most comfortable language) and mostly light music but she elevates it to fine art. Highly recommended to all who are drawn to the distinctive quality of this admirable singer.",1194566400,2,367,4.919354838709677
