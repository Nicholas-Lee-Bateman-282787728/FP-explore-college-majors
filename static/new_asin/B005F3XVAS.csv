4672374,3,B005F3XVAS,"Decent. Not nearly as good as say '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Condemned/dp/B000SM6FLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Condemned</a>' or '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II</a>' - but not altogether worthless.

The key to these kinds of flicks will always be the quiet badass. If he can't carry the film on his muscular shoulders, then the production dies on the vine. So it's critical that he be able to solicit a mix of compassion and admiration. We have to feel he's a good man pushed into a corner, just waiting to uncork some raw whoop ass on those who have taken away his dignity and placed him in a fishbowl for a bunch of limp noodle punks facilitating their can't-handle-real-life-violence via the computer.

'Arena' does a decent job of that.

And you can credit star Kellan Lutz. I have to admit at a grudging respect for the young actor, as the film progressed he got better and better. For his standout performance alone - a kicked notch above what would've been two lame five-pointers for a lackadaisical and pedestrian script.

Interestingly, there really is a true battle in this film. The struggle to decide who was more corny:

A) Samuel Jackson doing yet *another* cheesy turn as a slick ominous bad guy wearing leather duds. (and collecting another walk-through paycheck)

-or-

B) The sincerely pathetic acting school rejects making up the ""viewing audience"".

Seriously, this is a tough call. Which one was worse? After some thought, I go with the rejects. Due to the fact this flick could've done without 'em and still been exactly the same. How does that make one feel? To have an utterly pointless film existence? Hmm... interesting metaphysical aspect I didn't expect.

Adequate action flick made watchable by Kellan Lutz's sincere and energetic performance. And now that he's on the radar, I'll be searching out more of his projects. On a separate note: Honestly had no idea, until I searched the name, that he's a veteran of the Twilight series. Had to really think about it before placing the face, which I consider a good sign for his long term career prospects. Certain movies, particularly those favored by young teens, tend to pigeon-hole an actor. Many never overcome their fanboy/fangirl image to transition into more adult projects.

Utilizing the same premise, but done better, check out the aforementioned '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Condemned/dp/B000SM6FLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Condemned</a>' with Steve Austin or '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II</a>' with Michael Jai White.

Personal Notes:

- Kind of wished there were a fuller backstory to Daniel Dae Kim's character, one of the few genuine actors in this production.

- I honestly cannot remember the last time I saw a news presenter carrying a microphone while in studio. Actually, as I think about it - never. Small stupid stuff like this is why I wonder how some young directors actually get their film school degrees. Don't they watch real news? Ever?",1331337600,3,3262,5.770833333333333
4672375,3,B005F3XVAS,"You know the formula. David Lord (Kellan Lutz), a fire fighter who has recently lost his wife, is abducted in Mexico and is forced to enter ""The Deathgames,"" an illegal online game run by one Logan (Samuel L. Jackson), where participants fight each other in a modern gladiatorial arena.

First-time director Jonah Loop knows what he is doing. The fast-paced action thriller (written by Tony Giglio, writer of ""Death Race 2"") provides exactly what you expect from a direct-to-video actioner. ""Arena"" refuses to be taken seriously with references to such classics as ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" and over-the-top Samuel L. Jackson, who seems enjoying playing the role of the mastermind.

Surprisingly, production designs are pretty decent, but the rest of the film shows its low-budget origin. The gladiatorial fight scenes (one by fighters in the samurai costumes) are aptly violent and gory, but clearly needs better choreography. I know this is a low-budget film and not asking for a Ridley Scott-like grand action sequences, but the film's live-or-die battle scenes lack thrills and power essential to close combat fights.

After all, there are lots of films with similar settings (""The Running Man,"" for instance), but the hero of ""Arena"" doesn't have the charisma and humor of Arnold Schwarzenegger. ""Arena"" is an action film that is fairly entertaining but instantly forgettable.",1328227200,2,1404,5.231111111111111
4672376,3,B005F3XVAS,Pretty good flick..Samuel L is who he is the the plot is kind of realistic and the fight scenes are well done.  The story does get a little murky at times but overall it is pretty good.,1323302400,,185,4.0
4672377,4,B005F3XVAS,"Perhaps the best way to describe this is to say it's savory but for special tastes. I'm an action movie fan, fond of plots where the hero faces all odds and triumphs. From that perspective, Arena works. The fight scenes are fun, the bad guys are nasty in the traditional sense, and the bruised hero is true blue to the end. Call it cliche (and maybe it is), but it's fun and never boring. If anything, it remindes me of those WWE films like The Marine and Twelve Rounds.",1322179200,,470,4.292134831460674
4672378,5,B005F3XVAS,"Okay, I'll be the first to eat some humble pie or crow or whatever. I thought this movie was going to be BADDDDD. I was only gonna check it out b/c Samuel L. Jackson was in it and Kellan Lutz has proven himself with cool comments.

Yeah, I think this movie would have gotten bigger sales, had they had a BETTER TRAILER. The trailer makes this movie look cheap cheap cheap. The movie is awesome. After watching this, the only reason I can see why this didn't go to the movies is because Kellan Lutz has basically been a cameo kinda actor and this is his prime spotlight movie. I think b/c of him being in Twilight, he's had to prove himself as an actor. He definitely proved himself worthy of a starring role.

This is definitely a guy's type of movie. If you like Fight Club, 300, Death Race, and (whatever movie Gerard Butler's in where he's in a virtual video game) you'll like this. Oh, and there's lots of naked women. Yeah, this movie's gonna get hits gradually from word of mouth.

Simple synopsis- Guy gets kidnapped and put in like a virtual Gladiator type deal. So it's a green screen room that to the viewers watching on their computers and such there are cool backgrounds. (Think video games where you pick the background). At some point the characters even dress in character. (I.E. two construction workers go at it).

Yeah highly recommended movie!",1320105600,6,1362,4.524390243902439
4672379,3,B005F3XVAS,"It's not so bad that's it's good--and it's clearly not good, yet not bad.  Far from great yet quite entertaining, this death match, modern gladiatorial fight flick does the trick for a rainy evening when nothing's on TV and Netflix isn't turning you on.

 In a wardrobe that smacks of a Shaft-y pimp, Samuel L. Jackson holds meetings in his Pharaoh-chic throne room office and produces an online death show from what looks like an evil star ship Enterprise flight deck.  What's his show like?  It's a live, online death match.  The viewership includes bored office drones and college kids who laugh and make bets as people beat each other into Sloppy Joe filling.  Then, after the fight is over, the viewers vote on whether the loser lives or dies at the executing hand of the victor.  This is not original by any means, but that doesn't mean movies like this can't still be fun.

 Like a modern day Gladiator our star is kidnapped and enslaved.  To ""break him"" he is regularly waterboarded, electrocuted, or suppressed by blaring noise.  He has no choice but to fight, but to do so well could mean a glorious death--so says his leather-bound captor.  Still hesitant to fight, he receives an incentive: win ten fights, win your freedom.  He is renamed Death Dealer, which I hope is a polite nod to Frank Frazetta's fantasy art, and he starts to get into it a bit.

 The fights are pretty decent, mix the kumite death match-style movie with medieval  to construction site weapons play, deliver some solid brutality and gore, and most importantly they are very fun to watch.  In the opening fight, the filmmakers employed a harsh light/shadow contrast creating a somewhat Spartacus: Blood and Sand feel with a touch of 300.  The combat takes place in a greenscreen room which the producers alter frequently, not unlike the backdrops in video games like Street Fighter and Soul Caliber, which change from fight to fight.

 Production quality is good.  Our lead actor does fine for a straight-to-DVD death match movie.  During between-battle scenes his wounds are treated and it's like a healing version of Hostel.  He accumulates a lot of scars.  Some of the fighters' outfits are a bit funny.  Oh, and a naked chick shoots a guy with a stun gun.  That's worth a star by itself.

 Normally a fight without thoughtful combat choreography is ruined before it starts.  This movie is among few which fall into that category, yet still I enjoyed it.  Don't rush off to buy this, but it's worth a RedBox-remedied Sunday afternoon or a fun-filled Bad Movie Tuesday.",1318982400,7,2555,4.764840182648402
4672380,3,B005F3XVAS,"I actually enjoyed Arena a bit more than I expected to.  Sure-there's a fair bit of cheese in it but if you saw the trailer you knew that already.  It's not like the trailer tried to hide that fact.  Over all I thought Arena was a fairly decent movie and I found myself entertained by it.  It definitely has enough violence and nudity to satisfy the hardcore action movie fan (there's a fair share of T & A on display here).  I suppose the fights could've been a little better but the staging was pretty creative.  No one should be expecting top notch fighting choreography here.  In general-Arena is pretty run-of-the-mill, but the last twenty minutes or so raised it up a few notches for me.  I love that even in this age of tired and predictable movie plots there are still occasional moments of surprise.  This film took a turn toward the end that I wasn't expecting and the end result put a smile on my face.  Though it will never win any kind of awards for outstanding Cinema-Arena proves If nothing else that Kellan Lutz will some day be a huge action star.  He's definitely got all the makings.  If you are only familiar with him from Twilight-he'll definitely surprise you.  One last thing-for those who have seen this film, wouldn't it have been great if they had done a ""six months later""?  There was one thing in particular about the movie that remained unresolved.  Done right-a scene resolving the story after a brief passage of time could've been pretty satisfying.  Not a bad way over all to pass an hour and a half.",1318896000,,1532,4.496376811594203
4672381,5,B005F3XVAS,"Samuel L. Jackson runs an illegal Internet site that has live ""to the death"" arena style fighting (with servers in Hong Kong, Iceland, and Dubai). Meanwhile a ex-Marine corpsman soccer player named David (Kellan Lutz) loses his pregnant wife in an auto accident. David is suicidal and takes to heavy drinking. He is captured by a seductress Nina Dobrev (nudity) and is forced into the arena.

David is rolled around like Hannibal Lechter when not fighting. Samuel L. Jackson appears to relish his role adding character to a grindhouse film. Plenty of blood. Good killer sound track. Even has a few twists. Cult possibility.

F-bomb, sex, nudity. 5 stars on a grindhouse scale.",1318032000,2,676,4.9734513274336285
4672382,3,B005F3XVAS,"""What's the one thing we all have in common?...Death."" After a tragic accident leaves his wife dead, David (Lutz) is picked to take part in a ""game"". This game involves two men fighting to the death. When David agrees to do it in exchange for his freedom, the creator (Jackson) has other plans. My theory of movies lately are that there are no original ideas anymore. Recently it seems like it's either a remake, sequel, comic book or a rehash of a movie that has been done. Counting this movie, 13 and Freerunner there are now 4 movies released recently that steal from ""Death Race"". While I did see the others first it may have skewed my judgment but this was much slower then I was expecting. The plot is...take a guy with no family, force him to fight and kill for his freedom while the evil creator watches. Very predictable and is really only worth watching for the fighting and nudity. On the other hand, why else would you watch this anyway? Overall, not a bad movie, but the plot is starting to get old and over used. That makes it lose the excitement and impact. Because of un-originality I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - Not this one...but again I'm sure next month another version will come out.

4672409,4,B005F3XVAS,"Human trafficking is one of the most heinous crimes imaginable, but what if it was used for something other than sex or slavery? The story of Arena is of a rich millionaire, who wanted to blend the UFC with Roman gladiators. The people taken are all men in excellent shape, who believe they're about to have sex with a beautiful woman, when they are kidnapped, and forced to fight to the death on a highly popular internet site. Everyone from the rich to college kids bet on the fights and then determine the fate of the loser. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from a film like this, but the story far exceeded my expectations. There is a huge back story to their most recent acquisition, a firefighter from Denver who is dubbed as Death Dealer. Kellan Lutz plays him and is one of these OC, Twilight, model types, who gives a surprising performance. This guy must have some kind of special fight training and portrayed this scary dude, who just wasn't going to give up. He's paired with the legendary Samuel L. Jackson, who was his usual hilarious, twisted self. Jackson is one of these guys who is just at a point in his career where everything he does is worth watching, and in a relatively small role, he really adds a lot to this film. Arena was a little better than I expected, until it reached it's conclusion. At the end of this film, there was a huge twist that would have made M. Night Shamalyan proud. I really didn't see it coming and the ending changes the whole theme of the movie. It's the kind of ending that makes you want to watch the film again, after you know the ending, to see if there were clues to figuring out the truth earlier than it was revealed. Arena is far from an award winning film, but it's got much more going for it then I ever would have expected. It's got some crazy violence, but there is also has a pretty compelling story, with an ending that will absolutely blow your mind.",1417392000,,1920,4.396067415730337

(1.) Shaky camera technique as a cheap way to show action or at least make action more actionable.
(2.) Cheap props such as plastic looking swords and synthetic leatherette head gear and clothing with lots of pointless decor attached.
(3.) Excessively wild weapon swinging with the usual few kicks and punches that even camera angles couldn't hide as being just show. Very fakey grunts.
(4.) Prop-room, cheap prosthetic body parts, which are shown laying on the ground only after being detached from the body. Leave it to your imagination how it got there.
(5.) Storyline (redux for the hundredth time) of movie warrior-to-the-death contestant games for a betting viewing audience (the web this time). Same tiresome cheap control room monitors with two women waving their hands over a table (suppose to be controlling cameras) like they were scrubbing a floor. This was shown tiresomely, too many times.
(6.) Computer games mogul and tough warrior contestant dialogue all sounded so juvenile hokey it could only have come from Hollywood script writers having spent their whole lives in LA watching movies as the foundation for their life experiences.
(7.) Producers cost saving of repeatedly showing scenes of just a couple of internet fans' reactions to the arena events, over and over. Cheap!
(8.) Quick tourist screen shots of Paris, London, Johannesburg, Rio, Dubai with their names prominently displayed. Cheap way to say that the world was tuned into the action. Seemed cartoonish.
Positive:
(1.) Twisty ending (but it's been done before) of our hero warrior really being a trained covert plant. The only problem was - it wasn't very believable.",1349136000,3,1662,5.182156133828996
4672428,5,B005F3XVAS,"Interesting film. This is a mixed bag and a film with lots of improbable aspects. You have to suspend critical judgment or don't bother with it if you are looking for a tightly constructed plot and great dialogue and a deep message.

There are elements of Rollerball and how mindless viewers keep brutal money-making enterprises going. But the social scam/pacificaiton idea in Rollerball is not developed here. Nor the exploitation of ""heroism."" So this is only a dim echo of Rollerball. These fighters are being involuntarily exploited -- period. The managers are pure money grubbing egomaniac evil. The social message is very thin.

So far as the fight scenes go, I cannot judge. I generally only watch fight films to keep up with what is happening socially and in film or for stories built around them and not for the technical aspects of the fights themselves. But my sense is that the fights do not set any new standard for skills. They were very bloody. If that turns you on then maybe this is enough.

There was more to it in my opinion than the bloody Roman Gladiator sort of thing -- which is certainly there.

What was interesting was the sadomasochistic theme. Usually such films are tilted towards the sado part. There is plenty of sadism on the part of the managers here. But I would say this film was tilted towards the masochism of the central actor. He really wanted/needed to suffer because he felt guilty, apparently that he was driving when his pregnant wife was killed (and/or another angle that emerges towards the end of the film -- why spoil the ""plot"" such as it is?).

His need to suffer is not exactly a death wish because of guilt, and that is interesting. This is more like Mel Gibson likes to suffer, and some may argue but I think Arena goes farther and in this sense stands out. The need to suffer is played out here over the top, but it is convincing if you suspend disbelief about certain plot details.

So I found this film to be very interesting as a sort of artifact of our times in which a lot of people get a rush out of seeing blood and brutality and suffering. But in my eyes there was a little more going on. I saw a guy pushing both his psychological and physical pain to the edge. At the same this display of several complex masculine and human traits in the extreme made it possible for him to manipulate his female ""handler"" by eventually arousing depths of pity and admiration in one very, very cold woman. So, five stars instead of 3 or 4.",1338940800,3,2486,4.513333333333334

4672430,4,B005F3XVAS,"I liked all of the actors in this movie. Sam Jackson was great as the menacing, evil antagonist. Johnny Messner portrayed a villian very well, too. My only annoyance was the full-frontal nude shots of the women--where the hell was the male eye-candy??? I don't like my sexy films this gender-biased. That aside, I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes fighting films.",1333584000,,372,4.920634920634921
4672431,3,B005F3XVAS,"Perhaps I shouldn't be amazed when I see a name star perform in a low budget film like ARENA. The pay must be good and I'm sure the promise that it was intended to be much more was there. The good news is that when a name actor like Samuel L. Jackson appears in these films the amount of money raised to take it above schlock comes about and a half decent film comes out.

Kellan Lutz is David Lord, a rugby player whose pregnant wife was killed in an accident. Now David is on a landmark binge, getting drunk in the worst places in the world. Being the tough guy he is it also helps land him kidnapped and placed in the most dangerous game on the planet.

DEATH GAMES is an online viewer only match up between modern gladiators who fight to the death. The enterprise is led by Samuel L. Jackson as Logan, a man who has hidden the location and electronic trail of this show so that even the FBI and Interpol have been unable to locate him. As for the viewers most think that its all fake, that it's just special effects. They aren't aware that when these combatants fight one actually never walks away.

Recruited for the games David resists all attempts to brainwash him. Jackson's team does this to all entries, changing them from violent individuals to cold blooded killers. When David begins to show signs that he's ready for the next level, he's tossed into his first match.

The combatants fight in a virtual world so that viewers can witness them in all sorts of locations. But the hand to hand combat and the weapons used are all real. In his first match David refuses to be a part of it all, immobilizing his opponent but not killing him. It doesn't matter as the show has its own executioner and encourages viewers to vote thumbs up or down on the loser. Thinking its only a game, they always vote down.

While Kadden, the show's executioner and brainwasher, thinks David needs taken down more to be willing to fight, his captor Milla thinks coercion is their best bed. She also has taken a personal interest in David as well and begins tending to his wounds, both inner and out. Eventually David finds what he thinks is an escape. Logan had offered him a deal, ten deaths and he would be free. David changes the deal.; ten deaths and a match up against Kadden, which Logan accepts.

Each match continues and David wins one after the other leading to the eventual match up with Kadden. And each win makes both Kadden and Logan just a little more nervous while encouraging both David and Milla. Scarred for life, David's strength comes from his desire for revenge. Or does it? A twist at the end that caught me completely off guard stepped this movie up a notch.

While interesting in some spots the movie does have a ton of weaknesses. For an online viewing experience that is supposedly generating tons of money to Logan, how is it that college students and cubicle working hacks can afford to watch it let alone bet on the outcome? Why wouldn't someone recognize David and try to get him help? If someone could afford the technology to create a virtual world without glasses for these people to fight in, couldn't they make more money creating worlds for everyone to visit?

Two other items dropped the movie down a notch or two for me. The first is that this theme has been used over and over again beginning with the original DEATH RACE 2000. Folks battling for their lives as entertainment is not original. The only saving grace here for that is the twist. The second is what is becoming the obligatory kinky sex scene. Here Logan's two female oriental computer geniuses are entwined while he watches and giggles. Come on, really? The shock value wore off years ago and now it just seems like scenes like these have to be included just to guarantee an R rating.

ARENA isn't the best movie of this sort ever made but its not the worst either. Teetering on the edge of torture porn (a genre I hate) but not quite going over, it does offer some decent action and fight sequences and displays some genuine acting ability in its stars. If you're looking for something to rent and the top flicks are gone, then this one is worth you while if you're not squeamish.",1332201600,2,4173,4.473061760840999
