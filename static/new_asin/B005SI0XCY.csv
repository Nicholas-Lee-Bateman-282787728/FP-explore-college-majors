Brilliant cast, brilliant story and direction!  A must own for any serious film buff!  FIlm transfer is very good, too bad there is not a trailer!  Bravo!",1485129600,3,374,4.082191780821918

4885473,4,B005SI0XCY,"""One of Our Aircraft Is Missing"" is one of the interesting WWII Powell-Pressurger films, about a British bomber crew forced to bail out over Nazi occupied Holland, and the Dutch partisans who, at great personal peril, attempt to get them safely home again.  Good plot structure, dramatic cliff-hangers, and a very humanistic approach.  Of special note is the fact that there is no musical underscoring in this film (although lots of aircraft and weaponry sound efx).

Although there is no enticing artwork on the case cover or disk label of this particular DVD issue, don't be put off.  Inside is contained a nicely transferred b/w print.  This particular DVD issue is positively recommended for Powell-Pressburger film lovers as a worthy addition to their collections.",1340668800,2,769,5.169354838709677
8485121,5,B005SI0XCY,With extremely imaginative presentation this movie about courage and loyalty to one's country and to all that is good is a wonderful success.  The plot full of tension and release moves inexorably to a wonderful finish.  The British made wonderful films during WWII and Powell and Pressburger made some of the best.,1525478400,,315,5.038461538461538

8485124,4,B005SI0XCY,"More interesting for its context than its cinematic quality. This was a (by the standards of the period) a high budget propaganda movie. The RAF crew are solid ""all for one, and one for all"" regardless of class and age. The Dutch citizens (with just one exception) undergo great risk to get ""our boys"" back home. All survive: the one injury incurred is shown in the final scene to have resulted in complete recovery. As a movie, it's pure hokum. As a period piece showing the steps the UK government took to boosting morale during the war, it's an interesting experience. One further point of interest: the movie indicates that the term ""quisling"" (used for the one Dutch exception) had passed into the language in a remarkably short space of time. Vidkun Quisling had become Prime Minister of Norway only in the same year as the film's release.",1517097600,,845,4.716216216216216
8485125,5,B005SI0XCY,"I received the movie (blu ray) in the promised time interval. The Olive dvd is first rate in glorious Black and White. The reproduction quality, picture and sound, is great. This is a wonderful movie and you won't be disappointed if you choose to purchase it. See the previous reviews for the plot line.",1512777600,,303,4.62962962962963
8485126,5,B005SI0XCY,"This is what you're looking for. I bought a few other versions that were absolutely terrible quality wise but this looks gorgeous. I wish there were some extras but if you want a Criterion worthy print that feels like a true 4k restoration (which I don't think this is) this is the one. Bravo Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger and GOOGIE WITHERS! Yes! Buy it! Thank you Olive Films.",1506038400,4,383,4.647058823529412
8485127,5,B005SI0XCY,"For several decades, this first film to bear a co-credit for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger has been available only in crummy public-domain prints and videos. The 2016 Olive Films release gloriously corrects that. The Bluray is breathtaking. And by the way, the movie itself is terrific, with its rarely treated WWII setting--the Netherlands!--and engrossing tale of how a British bomber crew make their way across most of the country to the Channel.",1503446400,3,457,5.273972602739726
8485128,5,B005SI0XCY,"This is a great restoration of this Powell and Pressburger film. I had purchased the Alpha version perhaps about three years ago and it was OK. Now that I watch it in this Blu-ray Olive film edition, I noticed how much of the audio is clearer, not to mention the video. Olive films did a great job in this restoration; it can be compared to the restorations done by Criterion.

This is a British war film by Powell and Pressburger about 6 British RAF who are stranded in Nazi occupied Holland after their airplane and are helped by a group of Dutch farmers escape to England. The film is beautifully shot albeit in black and white, and it has tension as well as humor. It is quite an enjoyable film to watch and now it is fully restored and on Blu-ray.",1501804800,,752,4.333333333333333
