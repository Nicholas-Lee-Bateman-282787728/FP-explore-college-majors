8449248,4,B004Z1SMIM,"The sesquicentennial of the Civil War has been something of a non-event by and large, yet there have been a number of very insightful and thought-provoking books that have come out as of late on the subject.  Following in that vein Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB for short, the public broadcasting radio and television state network) produced this lively and informative documentary on the Civil War as it played out in Georgia.  At a running time of two hours it provides a nice survey level review of Georgia's vital place in the Confederacy, how the war impacted its citizens, how the plan to invade Georgia to smash the Confederacy unfolded and how vital taking Atlanta and Savannah were to the Union's effort to end the Rebellion.  In full disclosure I do know some of the individuals associated with this production but I certainly do not allow that to cloud or sway my opinion of this documentary.  It is fairly clear it was intended as an introduction to those unfamiliar with this epochal event in Georgia's history regardless of whether used at the secondary or college level or for lay people.  It certainly isn't over their heads nor does it bog down in arcane matters or esoterica, but lays things out in an easy to follow manner much in the vein established by Ken Burns' transcendent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ken-Burns-The-Civil-War-Commemorative-Edition/dp/B004AR4WSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ken Burns: The Civil War (Commemorative Edition)</a>&nbsp;series (albeit not as lengthy!).  Stylistically it's very similar with knowledgeable ""talking heads"" narrating and providing essential commentary on unfolding events, excerpts from diaries read against photographs of the era.  It's almost hard to remember how staid and dull documentaries were before the Burns pattern was established and how pervasive it has become amongst documentarians.  Admittedly my historical interest touches only lightly on the American Civil War, although I do believe it is true that to understand America and Americans you must understand the Civil War.  ""Georgia's Civil War"" serves nicely to refresh and remind viewers about what they may have known but forgotten and certainly will provide new details they likely did not know.  It hopefully will also encourage people to contemplate the Civil War, what it means to us as a people and society, and what its relevance is to us today.  I found myself pondering that, remembering the impact the aforementioned ""The Civil War"" series had when it came out in the early 1990s, renewing interest in America's pivotal struggle. I don't see that same interest in the Civil War and commemorating it today, although I have certainly attended symposiums on the subject and it certainly seems that ""the late disturbance"" as it is sometimes called is finally, slowly receding in importance and relevance as we continue to bind up the wounds caused by the war.  Reconciliation has a way of doing that and I don't see the rancor and animosity over the subject of the Civil War and the Confederacy that you had seen as recently as only a few years ago.  The sesquicentennial is a much more subdued and somber affair that the centennial and perhaps that's a good thing.  ""Georgia's Civil War"" seems to fit that mood quite perfectly as it doesn't loudly trumpet the centrality of the Georgia Campaign to the end of the Civil War, it's more in keeping with dignity and respect that the subject deserves.  While I would have loved to have seen a fuller length version that goes into more detail with a longer running length I know that GPB's limited resources and a likely lack of broader public interest makes that unlikely.  Those interested in more detail can certainly read some wonderful recently published books on the subject such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-the-Heartland-The-Civil-War-in-Georgia/dp/0881462403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking the Heartland: The Civil War in Georgia</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Civil-War-in-Georgia-A-New-Georgia-Encyclopedia-Companion/dp/0820339814/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Civil War in Georgia: A New Georgia Encyclopedia Companion</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossroads-of-Conflict-A-Guide-to-Civil-War-Sites-in-Georgia/dp/0820337307/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crossroads of Conflict: A Guide to Civil War Sites in Georgia</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-Like-the-Thunderbolt-The-Battle-and-Burning-of-Atlanta/dp/1594161003/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War Like the Thunderbolt: The Battle and Burning of Atlanta</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Civil-War-Atlanta-GA-Civil-War-Sesquicentennial-Series/dp/1596297638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Civil War Atlanta (GA) (Civil War Sesquicentennial Series)</a>, and the soon to be released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Battle-of-Kennesaw-Mountain-Civil-War-Sesquicentennial/dp/1626193886/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain (Civil War Sesquicentennial)</a>.
