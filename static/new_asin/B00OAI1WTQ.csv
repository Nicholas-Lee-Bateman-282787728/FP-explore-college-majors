8683009,5,B00OAI1WTQ,"THIS is a MUST SEE! I had the pleasure of watching this documentary at a screening in a room full of adult single men and women and let me tell you.....it was a GREAT experience. We can truly learn from how our pathology and upbringings have gotten us to the point where we shy away from building families and community. Some of it was very light-hearted, but watching the scenes with Paul Brunson and Janks Morton had some of us actually LEARNING the things we are not taught as young Black people to succeed in relationships. This is a GREAT video for girls/fellas nite in or a group screening. Grab some drinks and popcorn....it's definitely EDU-taining!",1412899200,,657,4.672413793103448
