8408979,1,B003YCL12C,Found this to be a beautiful view of Costa Rica with a type of elevator music and no comments on what you are seeing.  My students ignored it altogether.,1431129600,,153,4.275862068965517

8408981,2,B003YCL12C,"Upon receiving this DVD, I noted the fine print, which stated ""Also available in blu-ray as Earthscapes-Costa Rica.""

I have owned the Blu-ray version for some time and wouldn't have ordered the DVD version had I been aware that it was the same as the Blu-ray version.

Therefore, the DVD is unopened.

The content of the disc is best seen on Blu-ray.

I am considering returning the DVD version.",1326672000,4,396,4.695652173913044
