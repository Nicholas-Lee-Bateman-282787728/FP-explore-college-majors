3105826,2,B0013FMUYU,"Using the title of the 1st Patrul Rinpoche's important text Kunzang Lamai Sheylung as the title, this is a hagiographical documentary on the relationship between teacher and student (in this case the teacher is Dzongsar Khyentse Norbu Rinpoche). Alas, there is a lot of unintended insight into the almost pathetically endearing yet ultimately unfulfilled desire for personal wish-fulfillment on the part students in their relationship with a chosen spiritual teacher, but very little genuine perceptiveness when the teacher and his complex role is examined. Dzongsar Khyentse, it is true, does say a couple of interesting things about the phenomenon (mainly  that he really dislikes it) in this documentary, but much of it -no doubt thanks to the editing- has already been said ad nauseum by others, from Trungpa Rinpoche onward. Mostly, the movie is about a group of Khyentse Rinpoche's students and their willingness to use any pretext (in this case, making a movie) to fulfill their burning need to get as continually close as possible to their guru, and their guru's constant slipping through their metaphorical fingers like mercury when squeezed too tightly since he quite  obviously sees through their little game. I think the movie's main weakness lies in the inability of the students/filmmakers to observe their teacher apart from their from their projections and fantasies, even for a millisecond. SriDurga's review says it this way, ""What you'll find at the end of nearly two hours with this group is that the guru is the most normal person among them."" There are some nice shots of Paro Taktsang and the new construction going on there, but for the most part you could hear the same rather pedestrian thoughts being expressed by any group of Tibetan or Zen Buddhist students on the porch of any Buddhist center in America for free. The movie would have been a successful enterprise if Khyentse Norbu himself had walked around with a handheld camera and put on video the daily life of another high-level lama, like Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche in a perfectly unvarnished and intimate manner. Having your students video you and edit the result with their own narrative is not a way to get any kind of genuine result in the least.",1254787200,25,2233,5.032432432432432

3105830,5,B0013FMUYU,"This is a film about a Buddhist guru and his western followers, a Canadian engineer, an English fortune teller, and an American filmmaker (the same who made this movie).  What you'll find at the end of nearly two hours with this group is that the guru is the most normal person among them.

This is especially remarkable for a man who in his native Bhutan is revered as a god and who, if he let it go to his head, could lord it over his western students, who being in need of someone to tell them how to manage their lives have already given over to him much of their own intellectual and emotional independence.

The guru, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche (aka Khyentse Norbu), is in Europe and North America one of the most well-known teachers of Vajrayana Buddhism, the form of the faith practiced in the Himalayan countries of Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, and north India.  He is believed to be the reincarnation of a famous teacher and comes from a family with a long line of famous teachers.  It is not his pedigree, though, that has earned him notoriety, but his films.  He began his movie career working as an assistant on Bernardo Bertolucci's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Buddha/dp/6305428360/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Buddha</a>&nbsp;(1993), before going on to make&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cup/dp/B000WMEB1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cup</a>&nbsp;(2000), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Travellers-Magicians/dp/B000ARG2RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Travellers & Magicians</a>&nbsp;(2003).

Khyentse Norbu finds himself, though, somewhat reluctantly stuck with the job of guru.  ""I hate my profession,"" he laments.  ""So much hypocrisy, pretense, so much cultural hang ups.  I wish I'm just an ordinary person.""  So, ordinary is how he acts, to the great consternation of his students.  He cooks his own meals, he drinks, he goes to football games, he shows up late, or not at all.  As the Canadian computer engineer remarks, ""If he's enlightened, why doesn't he act like an enlightened being?""

Shot in the early years of the new millennia, filmmaker Lesley Ann Patten introduces us to Khyentse Norbu while in  residence in London, following him to the World Cup in Germany, the United States immediately following the attacks on the New York Twin Towers, and  finally to Bhutan where we see the guru in his greatest splendor, attended by throngs of devoted worshipers.  Along the way, Patten makes a detour to Los Angles to explore the guru phenomenon with two unlikely subjects, Gesar Mukpo, a recognized reincarnation and son of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/one-of-the-first-Tibetan-gurus-to-teach-in-the-west/dp/1590302567/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">one of the first Tibetan gurus to teach in the west</a>, and action-movie star Steven Segal, also a recognized reincarnation (of more dubious distinction).  Mukpo would rather play basketball than guru and gives Patten a quick course in recognizing bogus claims to enlightenment.  A good teacher, he says, invites challenges to his authority; it shows the student is growing.  Segal notes that the thousands that have challenged him did so only because of their vapidity.  (The subject of finding authentic teachers and the dangers of the guru-student relationship come up later in the DVD bonus material, a 30 minute interview with  Khyentse Norbu.)

The film concludes with the guru going into a three month meditation retreat and the students returning to their homes in Europe and North America.  Director Patten got enough material  to complete her film, a remarkably fresh portrait of a modern Buddhist teacher, and everyone seemed to have enjoyed their time in Bhutan.  None of the students, though, declare their independence or seem to have come away wiser or more capable of managing their lives.

8250719,3,B0013FMUYU,"How can you trust a reincarnated lama, a teacher as an assassin, ready to cut down your ego? What if this same enlightened one dismisses his calling: sometimes, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche admits, due to cultural insensitivity, hypocrisy, and weariness: ""I hate my profession,"" as it never lets him depart the spotlight. Lesley Ann Patten's 2003 Canadian documentary follows him to Munich for an England-Germany World Cup qualifying match, among adoring disciples in European cities, and the same in his native Bhutan.

In between, waiting for the Rinpoche to contact her, she must cool her heels. Despite the declared lack of a budget, somehow she winds up to spend the interim in L.A. There, Gesar Mukpo (son of the ""crazy wisdom"" counterculture ambassador of Vajrayana Buddhism from Tibet to the West, Chogyam Trungpa) confesses his lack of ambition along the Middle Path. Played off against his indolence--which may be as studied a pose as his father's notoriously provocative stances--we compare Steven Seagal, Hollywood's representative of one proclaiming himself an incarnate ""tulku.""

Patten leaves these two figures juxtaposed but in suspension, as we judge their integrity. Whether she does this for the main guru remains open to debate. As his follower, she seems to have let her film continue on in a happenstance manner, which may show her willingness to trust in her teacher's aleatory qualities, or her naivete that the results will produce a tightly edited, consistently produced film. She narrates portions, but she does not emanate a strong, compelling presence on camera or in her voiceover. Some of this feels hesitant or half-finished. Over a conventional length of a hundred minutes this wears down a less enraptured viewer. The music can distract, annoy, or intrude; scenes may belabor the obvious. She takes along to Bhutan in the wake of 9/11 a subdued, hesitant Louise from London and a sly, cocky Luc from Vancouver as disciples of Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche.

I liked the Rinpoche's aside to Louise about how her search for ""the right one"" sums up suffering and our plight. But this, for instance, comes after many minutes with a sluggish pace, anodyne music, and a lackluster scene-setting. The half-hour concluding the film, set in Bhutan, generated the most interest: you get to see the vertiginous, iconic Taktsang ""Tiger's Nest"" monastery, too.

What lies beneath the surface of the guru-student relationship key to Vajrayana does not emerge often. He's an ""assassin,"" aiming at one's ego; he confounds timetables and expectations as many dharma-teachers do. He informs us that he's a ""bridge"" and that ultimately, the seeker must find in the self the nature of the teaching. (A twenty-five-minute added interview allows the Rinpoche to elaborate: the buddha-dharma ""nature of mind"" is not external in a guru but revealed as the same in the disciple, and then, no separate guide is needed.)

Yet, the intensity of belief in the guide that students, Western and Eastern, demonstrate makes one from a distance wonder about the internal direction and the external motivation. Only hints emerge about this nexus what the Rinpoche calls in the bonus footage the ""karmic debt"" which must be paid by his Western students. We get his reflections more in that portion than in the truncated feature itself, where we don't hear enough from the students he captivates. His message intrigues--and he expounds his side of the relationship in the added footage--but why it does needed Van Patten's articulation in this main documentary itself. Luc and Louise don't take their onscreen opportunity to open up--Luc is challenged to do so, but his evasions appear very odd, while Louise's passivity leaves us little wiser.

A breakthrough briefly happens once. Luc and Louise watch the Rinpoche walk among crowds in his native land bowing down for blessings. I wondered how Westerners so enchanted by this sight might critique a Pope or preacher among similarly worshipful congregants. Then, we hear Louise and Luc carry on an appropriate if edited conversation attempting to raise a similar issue, if comparing instead the devotion of those sworn to follow Osama bin Laden into terrorism. Too little of this necessary admission of the students' side of the guru exchange leaves parts of this superficial and frustrating. The Rinpoche in the interview notes the Western predilection for skeptical inquiry which can overshadow or limit the practice of teachings, and the cessation of questioning, so I may plead guilty.

P.S. I wrote this before reading previous reviews. It's a bit more in-depth. While my critique may not jibe with reactions posted by others here, it's honest. I found this film only after learning that the object of the filmmakers' affection is a name I'd encountered in two what I thought were separate guises. See: Travellers and Magicians (feature film directed by Khyentse Norbu, 2003; reviewed by me Dec. 2012). Under his Buddhist name, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, he wrote the lively introduction (Apr. 2009 review) ""What Makes You 'Not' a Buddhist.""",1355270400,2,5090,5.192448233861145

8250721,1,B0013FMUYU,"Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche did a ""mo"" (divination) about the film project.  He said it predicted something like ""not enough grass to feed a goat for a whole day"".  That about nails it.  Not enough content.  It's about idol and idolatry, mostly idolatry.

DKR is fascinating but he didn't give/doesn't get enough screen time.  His discussion of the guru disciple relationship is shallow and general.  For example, he talks about how it's silly for students to think he's omniscient.  He never mentions ""lama khyen"" in the VERY first line of his grandfather's ngondro (foundation) practice -- lama, please be aware of me (which I've also seen translated ""lama, you who know"").  He doesn't talk about the difference between a spiritual friend/teacher and a tantric lama.  He doesn't discuss samaya.  He doesn't mention the standard caution to study the lama for 12 years before making a commitment.

The extras have a 25 minute interview with DKR that's worth watching.  And the parts of the film where he's talking are worth seeing.  I can't recommend wading through the rest of it, though.",1317254400,7,1088,5.005586592178771

8250724,5,B0013FMUYU,"Yes, as other viewers have stated, the acolytes making a film about their guru don't seem to learn a lot in the process, but this film is 5 star not because of them, but because of the guru, who sees through it all and quietly reveals himself. Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche is a delight to watch, and his words seem very authentic. There is an excellent ""extra"" accompanying the film - a 20 minute Q&A interview with Dzongsar Rinpoche. One of the best moments for me was when the Rinpoche was asked if he considered himself enlightened. I won't reveal what he said, but will tell you his answer profoundly affected me and has prompted me to seek out his writings, which I am finding bridge a gap for westerners who practice Buddhism.
PS... after viewing this film about 15 times over the past few weeks I must add that it is a very finely crafted film. Lesley Ann Patten, one of the acolytes, wrote and directed the film, as well as narrates it. She has a sardonic but pleasant voice, which is intriguing. Her very perplexity over all that is occurring reflects the groundless nature of Buddhist teaching and its challenges for westerners. The music on the soundtrack is perfect, as is the editing. This really is an excellent film.",1255305600,18,1229,4.590909090909091
