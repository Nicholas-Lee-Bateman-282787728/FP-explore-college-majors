1353102,5,B00004TY4Q,My sister started off with Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart for my nephew when he was an infant (he's 3 now).  My nephew was mezmorized my these videos.  When he was crying and crabby she would put this on and he would calm down.  Now his sister watches these and the other same-style video and they love them.  The classical music is so soothing to both them and the house in general.  I will hear my nephew humming along to classical music!  The colors and images are wonderful.  I would highly reccommend these as an addition to children's video collections.  A nice change (for parents) from those goofy and sometimes annoying Barney videos and TeleTubbies (although my sister's kids like those as well),1025913600,2,704,4.666666666666667

1353104,5,B00004TY4Q,"The entire Baby Einstein Series is wonderful ""Age appropriate"" video viewing for your baby.  Our daughter LOVES them all!  They hold their interest and are the just the right length.  You also don't mind having the video on because there are not filled with rhyming, or silly songs ... which she also likes.  Variety is important.",1023235200,,330,4.839285714285714
1353105,2,B00004TY4Q,"i was disappointed with this childrens dvd.  It is nice that they are trying to get childrens minds moving and teach them things i just feel it can be done better. for example they say the abc and count to 20 in 7 different languages which is good but they don't show the numbers or letters while they are saying them, there is pretty much a blank screen.  Also if you view the short theatre part of the dvd they are saying thing while objects are being shown ( stuff animals, toys etc) but the things they are saying don't relate to the pictures at all.  One thing that was very upsetting to me was that one of the objects they display are burning candles not a picture of burning candles like on a cake just actual burning candles i think it is uncalled for and could be teaching children to be interest in fire.  this was very disappointing",1019865600,2,843,4.283018867924528
1353106,5,B00004TY4Q,"Many of my friends raved about this series, but did not like the Baby Einstein video in particular.  I am so glad I did not listen to them as this is now our family's favorite in the series... My husband and I are even learning from it!

Each sequence combines familiar toys, shapes and graphics with soothing or playful music along with a voice over of various languages including English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Hebrew, Russian, and Japanese.
  Children will recognize familiar nursery rhymes such as ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"", and ""Old McDonald"" and be stimulated to listen and learn when hearing the Alphabet in German or Russian. Black and white images as well as bright colors make it very visually pleasing for young infants as well as older toddlers...",1017273600,,668,5.352380952380952

Whether or not the intellectual benefits are true, we'll soon discover, however, it is very entertaining for our daughter and the time we spend with her as she watches it is cherished!!",1014422400,3,354,4.693548387096774

Not only he loves it, but it's the only way to keep him calmed when nothing else can do.  I recommend not only Baby Einstein, but Baby Mozart and Baby Bach as well.  Maybe Julie Clark's earlier videos were not as sophisticated as others in the market, but everytime I see my son so delighted watching this video, makes me think that sometimes simpler things are just the best!!!",1009411200,,514,4.278350515463917

THe only one I have used is the video portion of it, which features stunning visual images of nature, interspersed with many baby toys being played with. The images are large (for your child to see well). In the background, narrators are speaking poems and nursery rhymes in several different languages. It's fun. Plus, they claim hearing the many different phonemes helps the baby's brain development.

1353117,5,B00004TY4Q,"If you are going to get a Baby Einstein, I suggest this one.  But, you can save your money by checking out Netflix, or other sources, for children's programs that feature a variety of languages.

From what I understand, when small children hear foreign languages, their brain forms synapses.  Those synapses allow the child to learn those foreign languages with more ease later in life.

I recommend that those who are looking to invest in something like Baby Einstein, choose one at a time.  Don't make the mistake I did by buying a bunch of them at once.  Or, better yet, I recommend that you check out Netflix, or other sources, for children's programs.  You might be surprised by what is out there and available to you already...with no further investment.",1407628800,,760,4.755725190839694

1353135,5,B00004TY4Q,"Got this for 6-month old so she could be exposed to hearing other languages. It's part of her night time routine now since it calms her down after her bath or just any time she's not happy. Our little girl just got really sick and was miserable, the only thing that calmed her and made her stop crying was this dvd. She loves the dolls, baby lamb and little girl at the end especially. She laughs when those images come on. I'm not a fan of letting our little girl watch television but I've been letting here watch this a little everyday since it makes her so happy.
The voices are all very calming and I'm trying to find another dvd that is similar since the two other Baby Einstein dvds I have are a little too loud and ""active"".",1303257600,2,731,4.228571428571429

1353137,3,B00004TY4Q,"I bought this DVD for my nephew because we are big fans of the Baby Einstein products. However, he does not seem to enjoy it nearly as much as some of the others. I'm bilingual so I thought it would be great for him to be exposed to more than one language, but the video just doesn't hold his attention. I would recommend the ""On the Go"" DVD over any other.",1281398400,,357,4.042253521126761
1353138,1,B00004TY4Q,"I purchased this after a good experience with a couple of other Baby E. DVDs which my daughter loved.  This particular DVD does not really live up the the standards of our previous purchases.  The music is funky and the images and the sound rarely ever correlate.  It all feels very random.  For example they go through numbers in various languages and the images are just random patterns that have nothing to do with the numbers.  Plus the music is composed of funky zen tunes you would hear in a spa which just reinforce the weirdness of the whole thing.  It's like they are trying to hypnotize the kids or something.

Yes I understand the purpose of the DVD is to expose kids to various languages but it makes little sense to NOT correlate the images to words.  It's a simple thing.  The fact is exposing kids to just sounds from TV sources is not a good learning tool.  You need to reinforce the visual aspects because that is TV's prime strength.  Any way, I suggest staying away from this disc and buying something else in the series.",1273708800,,1040,4.4787234042553195

1353140,1,B00004TY4Q,"not too happy with this one, it's hard enough trying to teach them one language, but to try and introduce it to an 11 month old, he won't sit down for this one either, so most definetly wait till the kid is older",1257984000,,212,3.953488372093023
1353141,2,B00004TY4Q,maybe my Dvd was messed up but the only english I heard was one old mcdonald farm song and hello! I even went to the part where theres a list of all the languages i selected english then would hit play I would here hello then the rest of the video was in another language. Everything else was in a different language. While I do understand why people think it looked homemade I guess it was trying to capture the babies view of the world. i like the sounds and graphics just more english. I do want to expose my 4 month old son to other languages but english is going to be his first language and this video could have had more but its good for him to just watch for now.,1255996800,,671,4.052631578947368
1353142,2,B00004TY4Q,"This is NOT the best Baby Einstein Video of the many that are on the market and I would suggest you buy all of the others before this one. [Particularly good are the early B.E.'s.]

Our principal reason to dislike this video is the lack of music which leaves it 'dry' and plainly dull: the readers are not particularly inspired and read in a monotone. Then there are the other odd things that others have commented on, like counting to 20 when the clock only goes to 12. That confused by son who is 2.5 years old and who still loves the Baby Einstein franchise.

And I would have thought it would have been more productive to read commonly known nursery rhymes, in tempo, in the various languages... rather than reading heaven's knows what.

Save this one for last.

1353151,3,B00004TY4Q,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1925,4.928792569659443

1353158,4,B00004TY4Q,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is NOT a language-learning program.  Your child will not learn any of the languages presented in the video by watching this, not is s/he likely to be ""smarter"" for the experience.

What you ARE doing is keeping doors open for future language learning.  Remember, this video is made for infants.  Beore 6 months of age, infants are able to hear all phonemes (basically, sounds) in any language in the world.  After that critical age (and note how young it is!), babies begin to lose this ability.

So no, your baby Einstein, haha, will not learn German from this video.  But should he decide to learn it later on, and you continue to expose him to the sounds now and then, he'll have the mental tools to learn to speak accentless German.

Note:  I have a master's from Georgetown University in Spanish Linguistics, as well as my own 4 month old son.  Though I have studied the documentation for these claims about critical periods for language learning, I always had my secret doubts about what infants really knew.  I can tell you from personal experience now that my son prefers people speaking English and Spanish to any other lanugage.

1353160,5,B00004TY4Q,"I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that the negative reviews of this DVD are from parents/caregivers who are evaluating it on their own enjoyment and/or understanding of it.  Of course it's going to be boring or confusing to an adult or even to an older baby.  The point of the Language Nursery video ISN'T to teach an infant how to speak the languages that are used on it...it's just supposed to expose them to the different sounds being spoken.  The concept here is the same as when you read your child a book or play a DVD for them in English - exposure to the different sounds used to communicate = stimulation/development.  That said, I don't  think any of the Baby Einstein DVDs actually encourage development at all. That's why the AAP recommends no TV viewing till they're at least 2.  These DVDs are nothing but a quick distraction for when you have to have 2 hands to fold laundry or mix their cereal up.  Period.  This is my daughter's favorite B.E. title, we have a few others.  The gentle pictures and music are something she is absolutely glued to the entire time.  And that allows me to get something else done for 20 minutes.  If you're looking for this DVD to accomplish something else, you're going to be disappointed.  I haven't seen one baby yet who is at least 1 month old who doesn't like this one, and hopefully that's endorsement enough. We're at 6 months and she still loves it.",1174435200,13,1412,4.515748031496063
1353161,4,B00004TY4Q,"BE Language Nursery is for children, every adult that is complaining about this video that did not observe their child's happiness with the video are speaking from their own understanding. The proof is if your child loves it and responding positive to it, it is doing its job. It is not made for adults. I believe this video is great. They use colors that infants pay attention to..for instance; black and red, striking colors, moving objects, cute music, nursery rhymes, counting, and abc's all in different languages. The different languages are foreign to our ears but it gives exposure to an infant's brain for broader learning. Studies have and do show that children that are bi and triligual pick up and retain learning information very well. The child will not get confused about what language they are suppose to speak. When I first watched the video, I placed it on English but it started with some German or Russian so I kept playing with the video because I thought it was defective and was going to take it back to the store but I decided to watch it and I started to understand what they were doing. Now that I played it over and over again for my daughter, I myself started to learn some of the things they were saying in the video in the other languages because they count and say abc's in mostly all the languages (Hebrew, German, Russian, Spanish, Japanese, French, and English). Bonus material is the counting, abc,s and the language discovery part of the video that goes with the cards. I myself do not find the video irritating, I think it is cute. My daughter is 4 months old and she kicks, flaps her arms, laughs, and coos loudly to the video at all the different images. I can tell which images she likes more because she will get very excited when she sees them.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because the video will not let you operate it on the long commercials in beginning of the video. The language discovery bonus portion of the video does not cover all the language discovery cards.",1165276800,5,2020,4.549450549450549

1353165,1,B00004TY4Q,"This supposed 'language lab' is VERY poorly designed. The dvd consists of images of items with a nursery rhyme or poem being recited in another language. The amazing thing is that the item shown has no relation to the words being spoken! It might as well be completely random sounds, since anyone who has studied child language acquisition knows that babies learn from making observations of language used in context. While I understand that supposedly this DVD is only intended to 'stimulate' the brain, by six months, a baby's brain has developed specifically to hone in on the sounds presented in his own native language, and to selectively ignore others. The brain continues to prune and forge neural networks in response to sounds from the language spoken in the home, thus the idea that random speech sounds are somehow beneficially stiumlating is invalid. A baby's brain becomes stimulated by the sounds that appear repeatedly in his own language. Habituation and imaging studies have shown this time and time again. Imagine if the baby's brain gave equal attention to any sound--the brain would waste valuable time and resources on information that would not be useful in learning to communicate with his caretakers. We acquire langauge so rapidly because the brain is selective.

Babies depend heavily on repitition, adult modeling, observing cause and effect, and from watching other people's behaviors to learn language. The idea that your child with learn anything from just hearing forgien language sounds out of context is very silly. If you want your child to learn language sounds and words from a language not spoken in the home, try exposing him to another language speaker on a routine basis, or show him programs like Dora or Sesame Street, where there is lots of explicit context to help a baby infer meaning, clear annunciation, and repition.",1154649600,14,1864,5.071661237785016

1353169,3,B00004TY4Q,"This DVD is good, as you'd expect from the Baby Einstein series.  There are lots of shapes and colors and moving objects that hold the eye of your baby while the narrators say things (counting numbers, reciting the alphabet, singing songs, etc) in various languages.  If it is important to expose a child's mind to different languages early, then this video is really invaluable.

However, the video does not come with a script or information sheet about what the narrators are saying, so parents can't sing along easily or repeat what was just said.  Without this, the video is a one-way street with random, incomprehensible babble going from the TV to the baby.

The only other problem with the video is the choice of some imagery.  Specifically, I mean the little black girl doll and the white sheep toy with the bobbing head.  These two images are incredibly creepy.  I think they may bother me more than they bother my kid, though, as he doesn't seem to be frightened by anything on the video.

Don't go into this expecting to teach your child a foreign language.  This video simply can't do that.  However, it does provide exposure to the phonemes of foreign languages so that language acquisition later in life ought to be easier and foreign pronunciations more easily picked up.

My kid loves the video, and that is what matters to me.  If he's getting an education along with that, all the better.  I wish they had included some additional documentation for parents, and that's my only real gripe.

There are some ""flashcards"" in the bonus section of the video that I think are helpful for older babies.

So this video is wonderful for the purpose it was created to fulfill.  It is not meant to teach your child to be fluent in many languages or anything, just to stimulate the brain.  And if you want to teach her languages later it will be easier because of this video.

1353174,1,B00004TY4Q,"Baby Einstein Language Nursery has got to be the worst Baby Einstein video yet, in my humble opinion.  When I first read the title ""Language Nursery"" I thought they would show things and then name the things in English....kind of like an English vocabulary builder.  Boy, was I way off.

I popped in the dvd and began watching.  It started speaking a different language.  It sounded like German.  So, I stopped it and went to the Main Menu to try to change it so it would be in English.  I tried it and again it was speaking in German.  I spent 5 minutes trying to change the language to English and then found out that the joke was on me, LOL, because the settings weren't wrong afterall.  It's supposed to start speaking in German.  It will show shapes, toys, patterns, etc and the voices are speaking in different languages.  The languages spoken are German, French, Hebrew, Japanese, Russian, Spanish and English.  12 minutes into the dvd they speak English for about 10 seconds.

In English they count while showing the face of a clock.  Clock hands are going around the clock.  Common sense would tell you to count the same numbers that the hand is pointing to.  But, no.  When they count 1 the hand in on the 7.  So, all the numbers that are counted and the numbers the hands point to don't match at all.  When they speak Spanish, they say the alphabet in Spanish.  You would think that they would show the letters of the alphabet.  No.  They show spinning toys.  So, how is a child supposed to know that they are even saying the alphabet in Spanish?  They go on and on with a story about a mouse and a cat (I can't remember what langauge this was....Spanish maybe?).  The entire time the story is being told they show a spinning pinwheel.  How is a child supposed to know that they are talking about a cat and a mouse?

This says it is for babies 1 - 18 months old.  Come on!  This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen and heard.  If you want to expose your child to languages I really don't think this is the way to do it.  They will never know what in the world is being spoken.  I would think you should pick a video that has all of one foreign language on it, not seven.  My 12 year old came into the room while I was watching this.  She watched it a few minutes and said, ""How do you even know what they are saying?""  I said, ""You don't"".

This is just very odd and I would think it could be very confusing for a baby.  There is absolutely no translation.  So, even as an adult watching this you have no clue what they are saying in Japanese, Hebrew, etc.  You don't know if they are counting, saying the alphabet, or what in the world they are saying.  How this is supposed to be a good thing to watch I just have no idea.

One recent reviewer said that from watching this dvd her ""son is now fluent in Japanese, Russian, Hebrew, French, and Portuguese"".  I question whether her son is actually ""fluent"" in these languages or has he just memorized what is being spoken.  That isn't a bad thing, but it really isn't being fluent if you don't have any idea what the translation is (in other words, if you don't even know what you are saying).  And an fyi, I don't believe that Portuguese is one of the languages taught.  I really wouldn't have given this any star but Amazon won't allow that.

Our principal reason to dislike this video is the lack of music which leaves it 'dry' and plainly dull: the readers are not particularly inspired and read in a monotone.  Then there are the other odd things that others have commented on, like counting to 20 when the clock only goes to 12.  That confused by son who is 2.5 years old and who still loves the Baby Einstein franchise.

A better approach would have been to show simple objects and repeat simple words in various languages.

1353178,2,B00004TY4Q,"I purchased this DVD for my 2 year old great niece. Boooring! I gave it a 2 star for the visuals. The DVD  is divided into 2 main learning parts.

1. Play-involves using different colorful moving toys, colorful shapes, and other objects to engage the child in some form of visual play while the speaker counts, sings, or tells a short story in a specific language. The problem with this part is that the languages change back and forth. One minute it's French, the next its something else. You can't select the language of your choice, here! It just bounces around, back and forth!!! It's totally disorganized! I got confused!

2. There is a section called Bonus material. In this area, you can select a specific language and here it teaches the child to count to twenty, names of a few fruits i.e apple, banana, grapes, animals... cow, duck, goat, and other items (clock,train). The bonus area is very brief. Not much of a bonus.

 Then the DVD has an area where it offers you an opportunity to purchase some of the items used in the program ( some of the toys); most have been discontinued.

Also, some areas in the program play the music so loud that it's difficult to hear the lesson. The program offers French, English, Spanish, Hebrew, Italian,Russian, Japanese, and German. The program is 30 minutes long;this includes the introduction and the sales pitch at the end. For $16.00, this is not much of a value. BEWARE!! There is a note on the back of the case, on the bottom, that warns that ""all players may not be able to access all features"". This makes it even less of a value!

I find that PBS has some great shows for free that actually teach her.  I was amazed when after one show Grover had her trying to say ""up"" and ""down"". She's only 13months so it came out sounding like ""ut"" ""dow"" and she was raising and lowering her hands very excitedly. She doesn't ever interact with the Baby Einstein.

Baby Einstein is the very opposite of the norm and especially the language nursery format.  Yes, it is slow paced and much of what is being said does not go along with what is shown.  But my child's attention is held by what he sees and hears on this video.  I have shown it to him since he was 3 months old and now he is 9 months and this is his favorite!  (I have 11 other videos by baby einstein) He laughs and talks at this video and trys to look around me if I am in the way as if he has never seen it before.

I agree with another reviewer when they said it speaks other lanuages but there are no sub titles to go along with it. I would like to know what at least my child it being taught.

1353196,5,B00004TY4Q,"I don't let my 2 and a half year old son watch any TV programming except for a few selectively screened DVDs.  Of the Elmos and others we have, this has always been his favorite. We come from a multilingual background and he definetely recognizes nursery rhymes on the DVD in French and Hebrew.  He loves especially to hear the Japanese, and frequently says Japanese and German words throughout the day.  What I especially appreciate as the parent of a very active son is that this video does not overstimulate him (it definetely puts adults to sleep however).  I don't like to sit him in front of the TV just so that I can have a break, so I end up watching the video with him, and talking about it as we watch it.  The pace of the video is slow enough so that we can do this and he can really absorb different things from it.  Some reviewers have complained about the fact that this DVD won't teach a language.  I think that's a completely unrealistic expectation. The only way to teach your child a foreign language is to speak it to him/her 24/7. This video does what it does very well.  It is slow-paced, I agree, but I find Elmo videos insufferably syrupy and I don't think most children understand what Elmo is saying half the time (I know my son doesn't). My son also has gotten scared by some of the monsters that make appearances on Elmo.

Bottom line: If your child hasn't been exposed to too much mainstream television yet this video is very entertaining and educational.",1095724800,3,1483,4.442804428044281
1353197,5,B00004TY4Q,"I do not encourage parents to plop their kids in front of videos regularly, but there are times when parents need a quick break to get something done and it isn't safe or practical to do so with your baby in a sling.

I used this DVD when my daughter was only weeks old, as it helped her cope while I was in the shower.  Without it, she cried and cried.  Then, when she was 6 months old, we had to move.  I let her watch Baby Einstein for an hour a day while I packed.  It was amazing how well it held her attention and how much I could get done knowing she was happy.

The images are great and the voices are wonderful.  You and your children will hear nursery rhymes, the alphabet, and counting in eight different languages.  The purpose is to expose the infant mind the sounds of various languages, thus making the pronunciation of whatever languages she's learning easier when the child begins to speak.  The purpose is NOT to teach the child eight different languages.  If you think that one DVD can teach your infant eight languages, you are mistaken.

I highly recommend this DVD for parents who need a few minutes in the day to do a chore and have a baby that likes to be entertained!",1093478400,6,1192,4.276785714285714
1353198,5,B00004TY4Q,"All those parents who buy this in the hope that Junior will learn another language watching it - WAKE UP TO YOURSELVES! This is NOT the point of the video. It is a proven fact that exposure to the different sounds in various languages (as well as exposure to variety in anything, such a visual images) creates new connections in a baby's brain that allow the easier assimilation of new information later on - that is, it creates a context or box to put that information in. Babies' brains are not yet ""hard-wired"" and can accommodate so much more than adult brains - that is why adults find it so hard to learn a new language in comparison with young children, and also find great difficulty getting their tongues around sounds that do not appear in their own language. The point is exposure, this video is not designed or sold as a language teaching tool. You just cannot expect ANY video to do that. I loved this video and appreciated it for what it was. My eldest daughter (now 4) and my youngest (now 9 months) started watching it and listening to the CD in the car from about 4 months of age. It captivated them and often was the only thing that would calm them down when upset. The CD in particular was priceless, in my opinion. My eldest soon progressed to copying the words and alphabets and numbers whilst in the car and she can make sounds that neither my husband nor I can make. She mimics accents and has an excellent ear for picking up new sounds and music - and who is to say that the exposure she got through this CD and video did not contribute? I am a trilingual elementary school teacher and so I feel that I can confidently say that this video and CD do exactly what they are supposed to, and are one of the best children's products available.",1093132800,10,1762,4.375

As adults we need to remember that these videos are directed for the infant to toddler and yes some of the videos might not look like much with a ball rolling across your tv screen set to the tunes of mozart but it has a real affect on my child. If he is in another room and I put the Bach video in he knows just by the music. He laughs and trys to talk to the characters. These videos keep my son focused, calm, excited depending on which video we put in. It gives me the oportunity to sit and review with  my son the pictures, words so I can interact with him. I have also purchased the flash cards that go with the videos and it helps reinforce real life images. The only thing I wish is that the videos were longer than 30min. Before deciding not to enrich your childs education, go to [...] and read up on there method and why they made these videos. These video were created by a Mother.

I study early childhood development & granted, I do not have my research infront of me, but it is important if you ever want your child to learn another language, for your child to hear the different parts of speach in other languages. After a certain age, a child can not distinguish the different sounds in different languages...that is why if you, as an adult, hear another language you might feel as though you can't tell where one word ends and the next begins.

1353212,2,B00004TY4Q,"My complaints are mostly wrapped around the ""concert Hall"" index. There are 24 songs on the DVD in a variety of languages. It is great except there are no visuals associated with the songs.  The same with the alphabet and counting section. there is merely a voice reciting the alphabet and numbers in 7 different languages.  You would think that the letters and numbers would flash on the screen in different colors or something.  Needless to say, my little one doesn't pay any attention to the video. She is one who ""watches"" TV all the time, so we bought this to make her TV viewing more developmentally appropriate and educational.
The home theater section is just like others have commented, a stream of sing-song like speaking.  there are visuals associated that sometimes don't match up.  It is tough to follow because the languages are all mixed up in order and there are no cues to tell you what language it is.
The only section that I like on this video is the language lab index (a very short segment of the DVD). There are vocabulary words stated with pictures that flash on the screen.  there are separate lessons for the seven languages (this time you choose the language).  This is more developmentally appropriate, but be aware, they also sell Baby Einstein cards to go with the video. Had I known, I would have just bought the cards and did the same thing myself.
Regarding the navigation of the DVD, it is awful.  There is a caveat in the parents guide that states it varies by DVD player.  However, the menus are compartmentalized, so there is no way to get back to a ""main menu"" without stopping the DVD and starting again.  Strange.
I am not giving up on the Baby Einstein videos. I have heard great things about the Bach, Mozart, and Neptune.  I will definitely read the reviews first and possibly rent from the library next time.",1067904000,12,1851,4.612804878048781

The language exposure is a good thing, but the images are completely unrelated to what is being said. I guess they have to do something to get the baby's attention and the language exposure happens in the background sort of. I will say that the one part that has particularly entertained us all (mom, dad and baby) is the Japanese alphabet. Mommy likes to be silly and add ""goo-goo-gah-gah"" after ""ka-ki-ko-kay-ku"". Anyway, rent it first if you can to try it out before you buy it.
I am still a firm beleiver, however, in limiting the exposure my baby has to TV in general no matter how great the production is. Two or three shows a week is plenty in my humble opinion. Baby DVDs are a nice to have as entertainment suppliments...

The neat thing about Baby Einstein is that I find myself chanting foreigh language rhymes (have no idea what I'm saying) with him and he recognizes what I'm doing.  So I only assume that on some level is brain is recognizing the sound patterns of another language.",1041638400,,607,4.45945945945946
1353233,1,B00004TY4Q,"Not only is this a bad video, it also makes NO sense. This is NOT the way to teach children. It only confuses them! I know that Baby Mozart and Einstein have been very popular and I even have them in our home, but now I know better! The Einstein and Mozart tapes are OK, but I give them a 1 star rating because they have ZERO educational value. The BRAINY BABY videos are FAR better for the same price (in fact the Brainy Baby videos are 45 minutes, instead of the 25 minutes you get with Mozart). If you put a Baby Einstein or Baby Mozart video in the VCR, what does your child learn?... that's right... NOTHING !
If your child watches Brainy Baby, they actually LEARN their ABC's, 123's, Colors, etc. as well as being entertained with BEAUTIFUL images! I say buy these types of videos for your children, (Right Brain and ABC's are our favorites) but if you want your child to become smarter as well as be entertained with beautiful and creative images, then trade your Mozart tape in for Brainy Baby. You won't be disapointed and you'll get a well deserved 45 minute break! I recommend your search Amazon a little deeper and find something worth buying.",1041033600,3,1155,4.427230046948357
1353234,5,B00004TY4Q,"My 3 month old loves this video.  True, it is a little boring for adults.  That is because it is perfectly suited to a baby's entertainment.  It is not meant to teach your baby different languages, but to allow her/him to hear the sounds of different languages because babies are ""primed"" for learning language sounds in the first year.  And if we both learn a few words in Hebrew or Japanese, all the better!",1038700800,2,409,4.486486486486487
1353235,4,B00004TY4Q,"I'll be the first one to admit, that I thought I just flush money down the drain when I bought this video.  At first I thought that this DVD would ""teach"" my girls a foreign language.  Like saying the ""ABC's"" in English then French, then German, etc.
It wasn't until I heard that kids need to HEAR other languages to hear the different sounds did this DVD make sense to me.  Example:  I think it is Japanese people that if they do not know English can not hear the difference in FA and LA.  So the Christmas song with ""Fa la la la  la la la, it is all the same to them.
My girls love it (9 months old), and it is my hope that this DVD will help them later in life be able to hear the different sounds.",1037664000,5,701,3.9361702127659575
1353236,5,B00004TY4Q,"This video is AMAZING!!  My son is 6 months old and is in love with this video.  He is a very fussy baby, but every time you put on Baby Einstein, it instantly stops him from crying.  He smiles and laughs and flirts with the dolls and the little girl at the end.  His favorites are the train and the cow in the begining.  I've watched it so many times with him, I am starting to learn the alphabet in different languages.  We don't have any of the other Einstein movies, but I am going to order another today.  A DVD this time so I can put it on continuous play.  He will watch Einstein 3 times in a row before he is sick of it.  It is a savor for parents!  5 stars from my husband and I, oh,  and the babysitter too!",1037059200,2,717,3.9097222222222223
1353237,5,B00004TY4Q,"What a great idea ! A video/DVD just for babies. My little one loves it !  When he's fussy or overstimulated, we just put this on and he settles right down-even talks to the screen and enjoys HIS movie ! It has been a real help.  We even have the Baby Mozart too which can help him lull off to sleep at night when a little extra help is required.  This is a must for any parent !!",1033862400,3,380,3.8461538461538463

7923239,3,B00004TY4Q,I think this would have been much better if the visuals related to the audio. Really this might as well be a bunch of random sounds and pictures. I believe it would have been much more enriching if the audio and visual matched so that baby could put the sounds in context.,1460678400,,272,4.25

7923246,5,B00004TY4Q,"I love the Baby Einstain series and the language Nursery is my favorite, as both my kids are bilingual and we started our bilingual adventure with this tape in 1999. I loved hearing the different languages and tried to guess wich language was wich of the seven spoken on the tape/DVD. Clolorful pictures were captivating for the children from 6 months on and the slowly switching images would be perfect for the developing baby. Nothing flashy or too noicy or harsh for a baby, but sweet, soft female voices, rhyming, counting and reciting numbers, alpahbet and nurcery rhymes from US and around the world! If you understand the consept that Baby Einstein and the Language Nurcery have, you will love this DVD! Best investment I EVER made for my babies education in the first year of their lives!",1423180800,,796,4.77536231884058
