He stars as Siddarth, the leader of a group of college guys who like fighting injustice when they're not in school. They save hundreds of villagers from a flood, but when the emergency supplies are misdirected away from the village, Siddarth is angry enough to kidnap the fiance of the man responsible and use her as hostage. The beautiful Trisha plays the girl, and the villain is played by the talented Irfan Khan who adds depth to what could have been a two-dimensional character. We also get the added bonus of Prakash Raj in a villainous side-role, where he shines as always.

The film isn't perfect. The ending is somewhat abrupt, though this is a common thing in Indian film, whether it be Tollywood(Telugu), Bollywood(Hindi), Kollywood(Tamil), etc. Siddarth's motivations are not always clear, but who cares as long as he's kicking butt, which he does so well. The soundtrack is not spectacular, but has a couple catchy songs. I still find myself singing ""Go Go Adhigo"" in my car.

Overall one of my top 5 Mahesh movies, along with Pokiri, Murari, Okkadu and Nijam. (Also good: Adithi, Athadu, Arjun and Rajakumarudu--if you can find it!) He hasn't been in the business very long, but they don't call him ""Prince Mahesh"" for nothing. Hurry up, Mahesh. We need some more movies from you!",1268870400,3,1514,4.8604651162790695
