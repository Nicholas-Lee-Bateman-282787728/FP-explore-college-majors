4851686,5,B005OAEWXW,I enjoyed all the films. I am fascinated by the sheer reality of animal existence. A true struggle for survival. It really put human complaining into perspective.,1373673600,3,162,5.037037037037037
4851687,3,B005OAEWXW,"Life Of A Predator is an 8 Disc nature documentary by World Class Films. The segments are as listed; In Search Of A Legend: Black Leopard, Approx. 50 min. This was the first movie that I viewed because I am very interested in learning if there are any elusive black leopards living in Africa. I watched an waited and the elusive black leopard was never shown in this nearly 1 hour segment. The Honey Badger,50 min. The Cheetah Family,50 min. The Golden Dog, 50 min. Crocs Of Katuma, 50 min. Wild Dog Island, 50 min. Savage Paradise, 50 min. and Savuti Predator Battleground. 50 min.

This entire Disc is in low definition, and is a strain on the eyesight. But for the low price they were asking for, I thought that it was a bargain. Of the 8 Discs offered, 6 are somewhat interesting, and 2 were not that interesting for me. And they were The Golden Dog, which is just a Golden Jackal, And Wild Dog Island, which is a team trying to rehabilitate Wild Dogs back into the wild. The Cheetah Family was the best for me only because it shows a Spring buck antelope, that turned the tables on this Cheetah Family and Killed the mother. Savage Paradise, and Savuti Predator, was acceptable but nothing spectacular evolved from neither film.

In Search Of The Black Leopard, was the most disappointing film to me because I followed this film until time expired, and my hopes of a black leopard residing in Africa were dashed. There were not even false sighting of black leopards being spotted, and the native people had told the searchers that they were wasting their time. I did not understand why they were even there searching in the first place. Once they found out that the black leopard doesn't exist in Africa they should never have made this 50 min segment.",1363910400,14,1757,4.556962025316456
4851688,5,B005OAEWXW,"Let me start by saying, that at first I was a little skeptical because I normally stick to NATGEO documentaries. However, I was VERY pleasantly surprised; as this DVD set was completely captivating! It was very informative, interesting and each episode was as good as the last. It did have some older footage from like the 70's (miniscule amount) to show the viewer how long the studies of wildlife have taken place. I would definitely recommend this set to anyone who is a TRUE nature buff. Thank You AMAZON for the FREE SHIPPING too! :-)",1351900800,8,539,4.684210526315789
