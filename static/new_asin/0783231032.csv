56818,3,0783231032,"1941 was scripted and directed by renowned film makers, so one would imagine that nothing could wrong. Unfortunately this is NOT the case, and before you ask why I bought this disc I will take the initiative to review it as a movie buff, and write an essay in my blog on what no film maker should do when developing an interesting story.

I saw this movie in theaters a long time ago, and it was already a disappointment. The two Bobs went on to write Back To The Future on a completely different level altogether, but 1941 is a disaster.

The Blu-Ray released has an improved picture quality and a full makeover of the original soundtrack, in 5.1 format, very well mixed. This is in large contrast with my former DVD which was transferred from a 4:3 letterbox picture that looked terrible.",1519257600,,790,4.5174825174825175

56895,1,0783231032,"There's a scene in the movie where Japanese sailors steal a radio too large to fit through the hatch of their submarine, and one of them says ""We have to figure out a way to make these things smaller"".  I first saw this movie when it first came out, and after all these years, I correctly remembered this as the only mildly funny line in the entire movie.

I remember being very excited when this movie came out.  First of all it was hyped at a level only rivaled by Star Wars, and second, it starred darn near everyone I thought was funny at the time.  I also remember sitting there, trying to will myself to laugh as it sunk in what a terrible movie it was.

It's an interesting study to try to figure out how a movie with a huge budget and undeniable talent on both sides of the camera could go so horribly wrong.  The obvious answer is cocaine, but Spielberg never had a reputation for that sort of thing.  Still, given the frenetic pace and the absurd number of sub- and sub-sub- plots, you can easily imagine writers passing a mirror back and forth, saying ""You know what would be *really* funny?  A rapist who doesn't like eggs!"".  ""Yeah, this will be the funniest movie ever!"".

I think the main problem is the juxtaposition of the high concept and big budget with Three Stooges-style humor.  Everything the Airplane movies did right, they did wrong.  There are way too many pratfalls  and *way* too much screaming.  Is there a pie in the face?  I think there is, but if there isn't, there might as well be.  There are lots of fights with comically long wind ups to the punch (just get out of the way if he does that!).  There's even a lame ""Who's on first"" bit (they're looking for Hollywood, and they find a guy named ""Holly Wood"", get it?) that goes on way too long.

Then there's playing things for laughs that just aren't funny - at all.  Treat Williams is trying to drag a woman under a car and rape her while she's screaming for help, while her friend is getting jealous he's not trying to rape her.  Sorry, nothing funny about that.  The zoot suit riots were a racist stain on American history.  Nothing funny about that, either.  Finally, there's the very racist scene with the one black soldier, which is basically the dictionary definition of ""not funny"".

I watched the extended cut, but even at two and a half hours, it seems like there's a lot of stuff on the cutting room floor.  Some plot lines are wrung out in excruciating detail, while others are touched on and dropped.  For example, they have a big build up to Warren Oats' character, but then he kind of comes and goes.

The last half hour of the movie is devoted entirely to destruction.  The special effects were impressive when the movie came out, but now the whole thing looks like a Universal Studios tour.

Honestly, I think if you had simply brought all these people together and just let them do their own thing, you would have gotten a better product.  Indeed, the best thing about the movie is John Belushi, even though he's obviously coked out of his mind, has nothing to do with the plot, and his part consists largely of grunting and mugging for the camera.  They needed more of that.",1496534400,3,3177,4.425862068965517

The gags are great, and the action is fast, and the dance scenes are memorable. All and all this is a great film directed  by Steven Spielberg, and written by Robert Zemeckis, and Bob Gale.

57054,5,0783231032,A wildly underated wildly funny classic Steven Spielberg movie with an all star cast giving their out and out best. It's one of the last truly old school madcap type comedies. A touch politically incorrect. A touch campy and absurd. A ton of amusing stupidity. Our story is set in the Hollywood Hills just before Christmas 1941. As the locals go to war. John Belushi's Wild Bill Kelso the drunken fried fighter pilot is a joy. Much of teh cast is well filled out with classic SNL and SCTV veterans including Dan Akroyd and John Candy.

57088,3,0783231032,"1941 is a solid film that works well enough in achieving its purpose, but not much more than that.  The film highlights the paranoia that California faced in the wake of the Pearl Harbor bombing, but turns it into a slapstick comedy revolving around a handful of characters caught up in the chaos.  It's not a great film as it often relies more on energy than intelligence, but it has a number of fun moments, such as the dance number and the climactic scene on the California coast.  Furthermore, every scene with the late, great John Belushi was golden.

Beyond the film itself, the extras make this set worth getting, especially the making-of, which is a great documentary that lasts for over 90 minutes.  The documentary tells some of the historical background behind the events of the film, the challenges of getting it made, and the various casting decisions (some of which lead to substantial revisions of the film).  It also does a good job of taking on the participants take on the reception of the film.  The only thing I would like to have seen is some inclusion of some of the actors involved such as Dan Ackyroyd or Treat Williams.  Nonetheless, it is well worth your time to check out the documentary after you see the initial film.",1467331200,,1246,4.631818181818182

As it is, the movie was just okay and a nondescript sort of way.

To understand this movie even better one needs to understand hysteria, prejudice and war.  Throw those three components together, et voila, you've the beginning of understanding of what this movie was really about.  That sounds both complicated and boring, doesn't it?

57137,5,0783231032,"One of the funniest movies ever made.  My sister finally watched it and she laughed all the way through.  But, there are scenes that some parents might have objections  between Tim Matheson who pursues a young woman who gets turned on in the cockpit of airplanes.  The scenes are tastefully done but the intention is clear.  The older comedies are by far the greatest comedy movies and can be for the entire family.  They aren't full of sexual innuendos and four-letter words.  For example, National Lampoons Vacation is hilarious and entertaining, but the recent version 2 of that movie has a 10-year-old boy talking about vaginas and the f-word at everything.  And the stupid parents condone the behavior.  This is supposed to be funny?

BUY 1941 and watch it.  John Belushi gave a stellar performance as he did in National Lampoons Animal House and The Blues Brothers.  1941 is packed full of action and fun all the way through.",1460505600,6,931,4.786163522012578

57222,5,0783231032,"1941 was a total bomb in the theatres, I'm still unsure why? This is a classic 80's comedy, its uteer chaos and hilarity! An all star cast, I mean really ALL STAR, makes this a memorable feature. Spielberg has some fun in this picture, adding shoutouts to some of his previous films, like Jaws and Duel. Parts of this film are based on actual events. There was a Japanese sub that made it through the American's defenses and it fired on an amusement park; there was a panic stricken LA firing in the sky at what they thought was an attacking bomber squadron, and there were zoot suit riots. This is the movie the way it was meant to be seen. The special features are amazing as well, the special effects documentary is informative and hilarious!",1452643200,,745,4.485294117647059

57225,2,0783231032,"Wow, hard to finish this one. I am sure in its day it was considered much better, and for many there may be a nostalgia factor.  But Spielberg (and a great wasted cast) aside, this one's a stinker. First of all, the cover is very misleading. Despite his prominence on the cover, Belushi is barely in this movie until the very end (which is the best part of it if you can make it that far). For that reason alone I felt compelled to give fair warning.  This is simply not really a Belushi movie.

You may love the Blues Brothers.  You may love Animal House. You may love Stripes.  You may love Akroyd, Candy, etc.  Chances are however you will not even remotely like this.  And I even liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neighbors-1981/dp/B005IX3C4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neighbors (1981)</a>. Aside from a few moments, it's just not that funny, and why it feels compelled to have a lengthy choreographed 50s dance number like something out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grease/dp/B00AEFY5TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grease</a>&nbsp;in it is beyond me.

On the other hand if you do like this movie, this appears to be a fine blu-ray upgade.

Based on the other reviews (which compelled me to buy it at this low price) obviously this is just my opinion and I may be in the minority. But straight to a library donation for me.",1450656000,,1423,5.373873873873874

It can really be seen much in the tradition of ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and ""The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!"".

57368,3,0783231032,"1941 was considered a flop when it was released in 1979. critics did not like it and it was not a box office hit. Steven Spielberg who directed the movie was coming off two huge hits with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third kind. This was Spielberg's attempt to do a big screwball comedy almost airplane style. And it may not be a great comedy but there is a good entertainment quality to it. It's never boring, something interesting is always happening. It has a lot of action and things blowing up if you like action movies. You see World War II tanks, submarines, and airplanes and machine gun fire blow a lot of things up.  And it has a great cast of actors, one of spielberg's greatest casts in any movie he's ever done. It stars John Belushi who was at the height of his popularity when this movie came out because of his hit tv series Saturday night live and his hit movie Animal House. You see all his trademark slapstick comedy act in this movie. It also stars Dan Akroyd, John Candy, Treat Williams, Tim Matheson, Nancy Allen, Robert Stack, Ned Beatty, Christopher Lee, Slim Pickens and the great Japenese movie star Toshiro Mifune. It was written by Robert Zemekis and Bob Gale who wrote the Back to the Future trilogy. And it has a good fun John Williams score. It has an interesting Documentary on the making of the film which was made around 1994. This movie was ahead of it's time because it inspired a lot of this type of comedy movie. Movies that would become big hits like the Airplane movies, Porkys, the Jim Carrey Ace Ventura movies, Adam Sandler comedies of the 90's. So if you like action comedies with an all star cast of actors and great filmakers, give it a chance to grow on you. It wasn't as bad as i had heard. It's an interesting early Steven Spielberg film.",1437782400,5,1791,4.427272727272728

57474,4,0783231032,"I think one of the most honest statements made about 1941 comes from its director, Steven Spielberg. What he says in the ""Making Of"" doc that's included with this Blu-Ray---and I paraphrase---is that he was drawn to the script primarily because it was a great vehicle for literally blowing things up. Further on in the same doc, John Milius, the eventual co-writer of 1941 with Bob Zemekis and Bob Gale, makes an equally honest statement by calling the film ""socially irresponsible."" Bear in mind that he means this as a compliment!

1941 makes good on both of those assessments even if as a comedy it falls a little short of the mark. It's a loud, undisciplined mess that has some very funny moments buried within 2+ hours, but mostly it gets by on slapstick to the point that you'll either turn it off after a half-hour (if you last that long) or sit back with it and go for the ride. This past week was the first time I saw it since its premiere in 1979; at that time, I was one of 6 people in the theater it played in (on a Saturday night!) and my major reaction was ""What the h**l was THAT??"" My other recollection was that I think I would have preferred being stuck in a room with Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music."" This time out, while I was NOT stunned by the subtle nuances that I missed the first time out (NOTHING in this movie is subtle!) or the reverence with which 1941 treats wartime history (you guessed it, it doesn't), I did find myself enjoying the thrill ride considerably. I was even tempted to go again!

Steven Spielberg once said that what he wanted to do was split the difference in his movies between the projects which had gravitas and the ones which were meant to sell lots of popcorn and give people a good couple of hours of fun. If 1941 isn't the best example of the latter in his filmography, it still sells the popcorn, and it's a much better couple of hours of fun than I thought once upon a time.",1432425600,,1930,4.358333333333333
57484,3,0783231032,"A feared Japanese attack at the start of WWII leads to paranoia and craziness on the California coast. Spielberg's just having fun with this one. Some of it works, some not so much. There are moments of brilliance, such as the dance hall scene, but there are also moments of flat jokes, baffling sight gags (what's with the mouse?) and blatant slap stick. TV fans will want to watch for tons of cameos.

57550,2,0783231032,"This film's main significance is merely the fact that it was directed by Steven Spielberg.  Thus, one can see the origins of the type of action scene composition that would serve him so well in films like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  This film seemed to be an exercise for him in developing that particular style.  Good for him.  Too bad it wasted so much money and material on such a technical exercise, because as a story I found it pointless.  Many ""comedies"" leave me cold and unimpressed, and this was certainly in that category - the kind of comedy that simply revels in disorder for its own sake.  Obviously there are people who love that and keep seeking out this sort of comedy.  I hadn't realized Spielberg was one of those persons.  Too bad - I don't see any value in presenting things as merely simplistic and chaotic.  One-note characters abound here.  The gal who is only interested in sex and airplanes.  The tons of guys who are only interested in sex.  The dude who wants to beat up all who disagree with him.  There is not an ounce of good humor in any of that - such a dismal view of humanity is in fact quite depressing to me, and thus I found this extended version of the film even harder to sit through than the original.  We have about an extra 30 minutes of that pointless dreck filling the screen.  Not every character is so unappealing, though.  I actually enjoyed Eddie Deezen and the ventriloquist dummy.  Robert Stack's role was fun.  But they have a total of perhaps 20 minutes between them?  I enjoy Dan Aykroyd.  He added another 5-10 minutes of interest (but not actual laughs).  It was interesting to see John Belushi after all these years, but unfortunately I didn't find him to actually be funny.  Like Treat Williams, he did a great job at playing the kind of person that I would want to avoid.  Treat Williams was actually more effective, I think, in being comical by overplaying such a simplistic character.  When the two get together, one expects fireworks - the actual result was very interesting but again not particularly funny.

In the end, the film does have various points of interest, but simply doesn't work for me as a coherent film.  I speculate that those who enjoy learning about and understanding the world prefer drama, in which characters are driven to seek order and meaning in their lives.  Then there are apparently the kinds of people who like this film - apparently they seek some sort of cathartic release by seeking chaos and pointlessness in their entertainment.  So it's probably a matter of personality.  I like things that make sense, and characters who seek to improve the world or at least their own conditions, by making sense of it - not people who think there is value in pure destructiveness and wild behavior.  I hate such people in real life, so why would I want to see an entire movie about them, let alone pay money to do so?  For those who need some sort of release from order and discipline, this movie might provide what you need, and I hope it's healthier to watch this than to simply get drunk or to actually go out and vandalize things for fun.  But it's a sorry thing to see ""art"" that reduces the world (let alone war themes) to this gigantic rowdy ruckus.  I can't even just dismiss this film as childish, because I didn't even care much for it when I saw it as a child upon its first release.  Instead, I believe its appeal is a matter of personality.  Those who are into the sort of humor that simply provides release from all responsibility and rationality, and who don't particularly care about people - who like to see people slapped and acting stupidly (or to mock those who dare to act normally and reasonably) are apparently the kind who this film was made for.  I'm surprised that Spielberg is apparently among them.  What a waste this was, except as an exercise that led to better things.",1422921600,5,3882,4.5338129496402875

57568,3,0783231032,"If you're wondering what is harder to create and direct, drama or comedy, let this be the final word:  Spielberg is my favorite director and arguably the greatest one still working.  However, he tried his hand at comedy with 1941 and it was met with middling success(being polite.)
The plot is hard to discern or keep track of.  This film is a paean, a tribute to the war time paranoia that swept the nation after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941 when the Japanese were running rampant across the Pacific and fools thought that they might be crossing the Rockies any day now.  What you see is LA(mostly) in full panic mode with zoot suits, anti-aircraft guns, German submarines just off shore, patriotic speeches, mob scenes, etc etc.  John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd star along with Slim Pickens and a bevy of 2nd tier 'stars'.  It's a total mish-mash.
NOW, reading up on the production of the film, it appears that the studio heads wanted a commercial home run with frenetic panic, etc.  Per those notes(from a movie website), Spielberg did have some footage that might've made the film at least palatable if not hilarious.  Though there has been an effort to 'repair quality' back into the film, you cannot repair things like that.
I don't like being negative and have never been negative in re Spielberg as a director(Close Encounters, ET, Schindler's List, etc etc.), but this film is irreparable and you might as well keep on truckin' to the next comedy.  There actually are a vast number of comedies about the era, the best of which(of course) were made years back and in black and white.  You can not go wrong with the team of Abbott&Costello...Charlie Chaplin and the Three Stooges also made a film or two about the time.

57584,3,0783231032,"I bought this movie because my favorite actor, Robert Stack, is in it.  As far as movies go, it's adequate.  Its premise is not really that far-fetched, because war hysteria is a real thing.  The execution, however, is silly.  There are some good moments, but for the most part it just doesn't make the grade.  I said it's adequate -- for any other director, it is.  But since we're talking about Spielberg, this film falls just short of adequacy.  Spielberg indulged himself, and a self-indulgent director usually does not turn out excellent cinema.  If he had restrained himself, and controlled his urge to broad slapstick, this could have been a very funny movie.  It seems that Spielberg tried to do too much, and while some of it was funny, much of it fell flat.  It also depends on your taste in comedy, I will admit.  And I will admit that broad slapstick, potty humor, and overindulgence are not my cup of tea.  This comes nowhere near other comparable comedies, such as ""M*A*S*H"" or ""The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming.""  Then, too, this movie may very well appeal to males more than to females.  If you're looking for really good comedy, you won't find much of it here.  But if you are looking for an afternoon's entertainment when all you want is to veg out, you may enjoy it.",1415836800,,1301,4.595652173913043

Not an all-star cast but star studded. Good humor too. A classic WWII comedy with excellent scenes from Belushi, Pickins, and Akroyd.

I can see why it was considered a flop, the movie fits in too many categories. It's a great cult-classic though and fun to watch now for a movie night with friends over some beers and wine.

57594,2,0783231032,"Only 2 problems with this DVD: 1) the film isn't funny and 2) the transfer absolutely stinks.

The film has funny bits. It has bits that could be funny. But Spielberg wasn't the director to make the funny bits and the bits that could be funny come together in an even remotely satisfying way. It's too long, it's badly paced, it has too many story lines that are only tangentially related. As another review said, it's not ""Caddyshack."" If you've seen other Spielberg pictures, there's a lot of little ""Easter Egg""-like things in it. Of course, they're not really ""Easter eggs,"" but they're clearly bits of business Spielberg liked. He riffs ""Jaws"" at the start when the skinny-dipper gets set upon by the Japanese submarine. Compare Belushi saluting the crowd from the conning tower of the Japanese submarine in ""1941"" to Harrison Ford saluting the crowd from the conning tower of a German submarine in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark;"" compare the sudden reveal of the ""growling"" T-Rex in the La Brea Tar Pits in ""1941"" to the sudden reveal of the growling T-Rex in ""Jurassic Park.""  And there's other clever bits, like the famous 1-second shot of Belushi as Brando as the Godfather -- a bit Belushi did on ""Saturday Night"" -- during the USO club riot; Robert Stack as Maj. Gen. Stilwell, lip-syncing to the soundtrack of Disney's ""Dumbo;"" and Sam Fuller as the commander of Los Angeles air defense command. Elisha Cook, Jr., has a brief cameo as ""Diner Patron;"" most people recognize him as the ""cheap gunsel,"" Wilmer, that Bogart slaps around in ""The Maltese Falcon.""  Slim Pickens is the most reliable player of them all. There are some not-so-clever bits, too. Tim Matheson essentially plays his ""Animal House"" character, Eric ""Otter"" Stratton, in uniform; maybe it's Otter's father. Nancy Allen essentially plays the ""Mandy Pepperidge"" (Mary Louise Weller) role from ""Animal House."" Christopher Lee is wasted. Toshiro Mifume was probably tempted to actually commit ritual seppuku. And the ""racial tension"" bit between John Candy and Frank McRae is utterly pointless.

On the whole, though, there's some visual appeal here if you can tolerate sitting through the stinky bits. Unfortunately, you can hardly *see* the visually appealing bits. The film transfer is appallingly bad. The lighting is off; daylight is painfully bright yet oddly washed out, night is impenetrably dark. The audio is useless. Sitting 7 feet from the television, my son and I had the volume at 50 -- when on any regular broadcast we'll set it at 18 or 19. The audio has no depth. It's tinny. Voices are mismatched. Maybe Spielberg doesn't care. ""1941"" isn't an important part of his oeuvre. But it's still got his name on it, and this DVD doesn't do that name anything remotely like justice.",1411862400,,2764,4.91220556745182

I saw the movie in the theater when it came out and that's exactly how it looked.  That said, I've never quite understood why he wanted that look!

57633,3,0783231032,"In retrospect, this film is somewhat better than its reputation.

Yes it's loud, zany, not particularly subtle, and not Spielberg's best.  Modern audiences may be put off by the ethnic humor without understanding the context and sly but unflinching critique of the overt racism of the day.

But let's ignore that, and look at what ""1941"" offers.  It draws attention to an early World War II episode that otherwise would be lost to history.  The paranoia of late 1941, the Zoot Suit Riots, and indeed the nationwide mobilization are for the most part not in living memory in the mid-2010s.  It is a fictionalized, very exaggerated account of the events and mentality of early World War II America.

Music aficionados will enjoy John Williams breathless score.

Spielberg seems to have somewhat disowned this, but this film was award-winning in its day, and deserves preservation and celebration in Blu-Ray .  It's definitely worth revisiting.",1404086400,,941,5.098039215686274

57645,3,0783231032,"So I remember this movie far more fondly than it actually is worth experiencing. I saw it in the theatre when it first came out. I must have been simply taken up with the craziness of the movie and the fun the actors are having chewing up scenery.
Fristly and most importantly the movie looks like it was filmed with a piece of gauze over it to put a hazy mist on everything for the whole movie. That is not the DVD, as others have mentioned, it is how it was filmed. With the resolution we are used to now, this haze is annoying in the extreme for me. It actually ruins the film to watch.
Secondly, although it's fun to look at the time frame and the actors and the scenery this movie simply careens from one situation to the next. There is no reason to have John Belushi's character plot in the movie but there it is. The lead protagonist is sublimated by the secondary actors - chief among them Dan Ackroyd. The secondary characters completely take over the movie and I no longer cared about the main plot if there was one.
It's fun to look at in spots but really Spielberg is out of control as a director here. View at your own risk and have fun.",1402963200,,1150,4.208144796380091

57651,4,0783231032,"Guys and gals, I am happy. Just discovered you can buy a high definition, streaming 1941 on Amazon instant.

The most recent release of 1941 was a DVD which came out near the beginning of the format. The transfer used was the same one used for laserdisc. It had a widescreen letterbox transfer made to fit the older square TV screens, instead of the anamorphic widescreen format that looks better on the (now, firmly established) 16:9 TV's. The DVD had the film as an extended director's cut (putting in the scenes that were added to network TV showings and a little more) which I think improved the film for the most part (although I was already a fan).

It is clear that Speilberg was either compelled or thought it was best to keep the theatrical version under 2 hours (the theatrical version runs 1:58 and the extended version runs 2:26). The DVD also had a making of documentary, trailers and other extras (carried over from the laserdisc set). All good stuff to have but the longer version of the movie, the full length documentary and the other stuff made for a bigger than what is normal amount of stuff on the DVD (now it would on 2 DVD's, one with the movie and the other with the documentary). It compressed the video more and that fact combined with the older non anamorphic transfer made for a DVD which doesn't stand up well quality wise on today's TV's. The DVD is still worth having for the extra scenes and all the other things but for actually watching the movie, it didn't cut it anymore.

So, I have waiting for this to come out on blu ray or at least a newly produced transfer DVD. Thankfully, until then, this streaming version looks fine. But it is the original theatrical version. My hope is that someday a blu ray will come out with both the theatrical and extended versions.

Be prepared for the fact that some scenes were shot with a large amount of diffusion. Especially the beginning where Susan Backlinie does the parody of her original JAWS skinny-dipping. The diffusion and haze helped keep it all PG.

This movie is generally considered a disappointment for Spielberg, both critically and financially. But I always thought it stood up well alongside (even if it didn't surpass) madcap/slapstick comedies like It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World. The concept of exploring the hysteria in an Hollywood following Pearl Harbor (sufficiently far away and removed from where the horror was taking place) may have been unorthodox but it worked for me. The special effects (utilizing miniatures of a 1940's city, amusement park and planes) are incredible.

Oddly enough much of the complaints I heard about the movie at the time was not about quality or laughs but the decision to have John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd share no scenes together until they had arguably one (a far off salute to each other) around the end.

This movie has it's fans and following and it has it's detractors. If you haven't seen it check it out and find out which side you are on.",1398816000,,2974,4.631878557874763
57652,5,0783231032,"I saw this movie when it was released back in 1979, and haven't seen it again until I received this DVD. This version has been re-edited by Spielberg to be a bit more coherent. While some may not like it (it isn't his usual fare) it is a fun movie that has a great cast of stars of that time from both TV and film. the best part for me (besides the exploits of 'Wild Bill' Kelso, played by John Belushi) was the very rousing speech given by Sgt.

THE BEST PARTS.  The following are the best parts, in my opinion.
(1) DANCING.  Primarily, what had stood out for me was the massive jitterbug dancing contest.  I liked that the most, because I took 3 months of jitterbug lessons, as well as 3 months of tap, in preparation to be a member of a clogging group.  As a member of a clogging group based in Madison, WI, we performed at agricultural fairs and bluegrass festivals throughout the midwest.
(2) FERRIS WHEEL.  Next, what I liked was the scene on the Ferris wheel with Eddie Deezen.  In this scene, Mr. Deezen acts like an ""uber-nerd.""  In this scene, or actually a cluster of related in scenes, a Japanese submarine fires on the Santa Monica pier amusement park thinking that it is an industrial complex, where the result is that the axle of the Ferris wheel is cut free from its support, and the Ferris wheel rolls slowly down the Santa Monica pier and plunges into the ocean.
(3) SLIM PICKENS.  Third, I liked the scenes with Slim Pickens.  Mr. Pickens earlier achieved fame in the movie Dr. Strangelove, where he dresses like a cowboy and cries ""yee-haw"" as he rides a hydrogen bomb that is dropped from a bomber.  In the film 1941, Slim Pickens plays the character of a farmer, where his character's name is Hollis Wood.  This fact results in an amusing scene involving the Japanese submariners, who capture Slim Pickens because they need guidance on finding a target to attack, such as Hollywood.  ""Where is Hollywood,"" asks the gruff Japanese commander.  ""You're looking at him,"" replies Hollis Wood.  ""Where is Hollywood,"" repeats the gruff Japanese commander.  As part of this scene, Slim Pickens' box of Cracker Jack is opened, and inside is a prize, and the prize is a compass.  The goal of the Japanese was to capture Slim Pickens to acquire guidance on how to find Hollywood, because of the fact that the submarine's compass had broken.  But the Slim Pickens character is clever, and he quickly grabs the Cracker Jack prize and swallows it.  Consequently, the Japanese force Slim Pickens to sit on the toilet for a day.
(4) DUMBO.  Occupying a prominent part of the center of the film, is the episode where General Joseph Stilwell watches Dumbo in a movie theater.  Stilwell is interrupted, now and then, by aids who inform him of the war situation in the Los Angeles area, but Stilwell asks that they leave him alone for the time being, so that he can enjoy Dumbo.  In the famous scene where Dumbo's mother is locked up, Stilwell is shown crying with sadness.  Many baby boomers, and certainly those from an earlier generation, have also cried during this scene.

RUNNING JOKES.  Much of the film is occupied with running jokes.  The plot of this film, which is generally occupied by massive amounts of commotion and slapstick, is that Treat Williams (handsome but arrogant) and Bobby Di Cicco (loveable and sincere) are both vying for the attention of the same girl (beautiful Dianne Kay).  As part of this plot, a fat girl is in continual pursuit of Treat Williams.  And so, there are periodic fights between Treat and Bobby, and periodic chase scenes, where the fat girl is after Treat, and Treat is after Bobby.  One of the running jokes is that Treat Williams hate eggs as a food.  Another running joke is a sub-plot, taking the form of a young woman who enjoys concupiscence, but only if it occurs in the cockpit of a flying airplane.  Yet another running joke, or actually a form of amusing character presentation, is John Belushi's gruff persona.

CONCLUSION.  This film will leave you breathless, with its continual slapstick, effective use of color, and over-the-top mock violence.  To fully appreciate this movie, you need to have some training in jitterbug.  That way, you will recognize many of the dance steps and dance floor maneuvers taking place.  Also, to fully appreciate this movie, you need to have been a kid in the era when Crackerjack boxes contained prizes.  Also to fully appreciate this movie, it is essential that the viewer (as an impressionable teenager) had already seen the film, Dumbo.  To tell you the truth, I am not sure why anybody would have given this film less than five stars.  1941 is much, much, much, much better than another film to which it has been compared, namely, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.",1388707200,2,4501,4.697318007662835

57726,3,0783231032,"""1941"" should be seen by any fans of Belushi and Ackroyd, et al. The whole is less than the sum of its stars parts.  So I have the DVD but have not watched it.  I will  skim though it shortly. I saw ""1941"" during the original run, once. The dvd age came aobut and I only remembered the film was 'big', it had the right names and I should have it.  Otherwise nowadays absorbed by the web while radio is on in the background means a pile of discs remain unwatched.

For some ""1941"" reviewers, the ensemble of 'Mad Mad World' is invoked. Yes that is apt - for me as the sub captain [Mitamura/ Mifune] invoked the grail of ""Hollywood"" as fervently as the protagonists of ""Mad, Mad, Mad World"" did of the ""Big W""! But ""Mad World"" is truly a treasure and ""1941"" is not.

""1941""only came to mind tonight as I saw a cable program regarding aliens and such that was chiefly about the Feb. 1942 ""Battle of Los Angeles"".  An epic, astounding event.  ""1941"" was written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. What did they and Spielberg know of it?  I thought of the movie as I watched tv and was confused at first that it was..no not ""1942"", it's ""1941"".  The movie's events must be taken to occur sometime during approx. 3 weeks from Dec. 8 and Dec. 31 1941!

Instead of taking something small and inflating it into near comedic bloat [such as shame with the stars they had]...imagine what could have been if it was ""1942"" set in the frenzy of incorporating what was an actual blackout of LA, fighters scrambled to chase a UFO-like object and over a thou' shells fired, all ineffective [and the thing disappears after all], as this very Japanese sub comes a la ""1941"" in a sorry effort to invade. Take it from there...that's my pitch.",1376611200,,1718,4.371069182389937

57746,3,0783231032,"Wanna watch Akroyd, Belushi, Candy, kick their heels way up in a wild movie? This is the one.

Problem is: too much heel kickin' for too long a time...hilarious scenes, against terrific cinematography, ultimately do not constitute a great movie. Laurel and Hardy, Three Stooges, The Marx Brothers, could get away with crazy scenes and no continuity, mostly because they made 17 minute, to 70 minute movies. Two hours? No way.

Another issue, is that the premise, six days after Pearl harbor, La-La Land, unprepared for nothing more than jitterbugging and zoning out at the movies, suddenly becomes (somewhat) useful in the War effort, suggests that only the most darkly, surreal, carefully constructed, piece of art, can sustain. Yes, there are stretches of genius: Akroyd is is charge of Airplane maintenance (as I recall) and he takes on the proportions of John Wayne as he approaches a local family about installing a huge weapon in their backyard. The humor is perfectly realized, as good as anything the actor did on Saturday Nite Live...but against the reality of December 7th, it loses alot of lustre and we have something in very bad taste.

It's been said that Spielberg thought a ""Hollywood Musical"" [in the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland mode] would be the ticket but he was convinced a fairly straight ahead ""drama with comedy"" would be better.

If Spielberg did the musical, then the movie would have fit in to the ""Airplane"" genre and been a lot more..respectable.

The movie *is* successful at being consistently funny while paying tribute to JAWS, DR. STRANGELOVE, AIRPLANE!, TORA TORA TORA (never saw it but another Reviewer here says it fits), THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, and probably other films we assume Steve S. loved, coming up.

But check it out if you can, as a used item here on Amazon..and watch it...piece by piece...or as a string of SNL sketches.

57768,5,0783231032,"This film was awesome, with Belushi playing Wild Bill Kelso, a crazed Army Air Corps fighter pilot chasing a phantom Japanese squadron to Robert Stack in his straight role as Vinegar Joe Stillwell, an Army commander who would fight on the Chinese Front (and get little credit for his efforts). The movie included some of the crew from Animal House and, to the detriment of the film, focused too much on the sex gags in some places. Yet it had many memorable scenes: The antiaircraft gun placed in someone's front yard, the mad colonel convinced he's being attacked by  enemy parachutists, the Japanese I-boat crew trying to find Hollywood, the technical whiz of a sergeant, the dummy on the ferris wheel. It made for a fun movie, if a long one.

As an aside, many of the events portrayed in the movie are based on fact, although obviously not as shown. Following Pearl Harbor there was indeed a Battle of Los Angeles, in which war nerves led to an all out flak barrage over the city during a false alarm (I think some UFO nuts still try to claim flying saucers were responsible). There were indeed Zoot Suit Riots in L.A., at least partially ethnically-motivated.

There are a lot of characters in this film: Dan Ackroyd, John Candy, Christopher Lee, even Lenny and Squiggy as Air Defenders! It's like my generation's version of It's  Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. If you've never seen it you owe it to yourself to watch.",1360886400,2,1417,4.633466135458168

A light hearted take on the psyche of the American citizens in the days after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor; when patriotism was tested and American pride had been bruised, the folks on the home front were determined to defend our country at any cost. Slim Pickens is hysterically funny; Ned Beatty is great as the typical 40's patriarch keeping the wolves away from two beautiful young USO newbie daughters mobbed by lonely military guys; while his two younger sons engage in typical adventures of their young imagination fueled by the unrest in the world. Ned is the guy who would have been in uniform if he were eligible to serve, and jumps at the chance to serve his country from his own backyard. His naive wife is scared silly with the usual war propaganda and wants all guns out of her house, which inspires Ned to prove he has the courage to do whatever it takes to repell the invaders, even if that means all he owns is blown to smithereens once he remembers the sequence the Army guy told him to ""never"" initiate with the canon installation left in his backyard to defend the California coast! As his wife frantically runs from room to room gathering knickknacks and photos, each time she looks toward a window, she can see Ned swinging the muzzle of the cannon in the front yard through the windows in the front of the house to the windows in the back to get a good shot at a Jap sub just off shore.

With actors like John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, John Candy and a slew of actors you will immediately recognize when you see them, this film will have you laughing from start to finish.",1329091200,4,482,4.206521739130435
57802,5,0783231032,"I originally got this on VHS, only to be replaced by DVD. Nice upgrade. If you're not a technophobe, and don't mind that it doesn't come with an original theatrical version, this is a great upgrade from the standard VHS version.

For the movie itself, I can see why a lot of critics ragged on Spielburg for this. They just didn't get his humor and he was ahead of his time on this one. It's got so many subtle moments that if you don't pay attention, and you don't watch this more than once or are preoccupied when you watch, you're gonna miss half the movie. First, it's got the 40's pegged very well...both in styles, dress, mannerisms, and everything else. Maybe except Bobbie DiCicco's haircut...a bit long for a 40's sailor...but that's not a big deal really. The music, the dancing, the ebbs and flows of the action just draw you right into the looniness of the whole situation and how group-think can get carried away into panacea. In some ways, it's a lot like a combination of Blues Brothers, Animal House and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. It's got a who's who of actors. Slim Pickins sitting on the can on the Jap sub was one of the best clips on film. The Jaws parady opening scenes...just classic!!! The scene with the Japanese Submariners as ninja Christmas Trees (part of the new footage) is a great addition. The Dumbo scene in the theater...it just doesn't get much better. Belushi gassing up the plane, Ackroyd with the bug eyes, the Dummy on the ferris wheel are all great scenes. How can you not find that funny?

Not all the added/new footage is classic and some slows the movie down a bit, especially the diner scenes, but I still would rather have it in there than not...if given only one version for a choice. Hopefully for you purists, an eventual Blu-Ray release will give us both original theatrical and extended versions and maybe some surprises. Hopefully not rotten eggs. If you have not yet tried this film, you are missing something great. Go into it open minded.. In my books, this is one of Spielburg's hidden gems.",1327968000,4,2048,4.547425474254743

I was quite shocked to buy the disc and find that first and foremost it is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, so you have to zoom to view it in the proper aspect ratio, thus distorting the resolution.  Secondly, the colors on this print are very blurred.  It was originally slapped onto DVD at the end of the '90s, well before the concept of cleaning prints and removing dust and fecks was common practice.

57815,2,0783231032,"1941(1979) is a mixed bag. This is considered one of director Steven Spielberg's weakest movies. It's been accused of being anti-American. People in the U.S.A. try to defend their country after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Spielberg struggles to combine slapstick comedy with a war movie. 1941 is not a total turkey. The music score by John Williams is very good. The special effects by L.B. Abbott and Greg Jein are quite good. The scene with the Ferris wheel rolling into the ocean was funny!
The scene with Nancy Allen screaming at a ""dinosaur"" was prophetic! Spielberg directed Jurassic Park(1993)! The late, great John Belushi played psychotic fighter pilot Bill Kelso. Spielberg spoofs a scene from Jaws(1975) where Susan Backlinie swims in the ocean and she ends up on the deck of a Japanese submarine. This is the equivalent of having Alfred Hitchcock film a  shower scene of Janet Leigh for Family Plot(1976) and having Leigh get hit by a baseball! 1941 has also been criticized for ""overkill"". In the late 1970's, some movie critics felt that Hollywood green lit projects for scripts that weren't that good. Star Trek The Motion Picture, The Black Hole, The Swarm, and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure were examples. The extras on this DVD make up for the film's flaws. 1941 is worth a look if one has a lot of patience.",1307145600,,1326,4.841409691629956

From the opening sequence (a hysterical send-up of the ""Jaws"" opening) to the final crazy madness, I couldn't stop laughing.  Yes, the story is ridiculous (the ""love story"" especially is kind of dumb, and the ""sex only in an airplane"" is just stupid), but from what I've heard from older family members who lived in that part of the world in 1941, the movie accurately depicts the attitudes of many folks -- the near hysteria over possible additional attacks, the civilian look-outs, etc.  OK, so maybe it's a *little* exaggerated in this movie, but it was very real at the time.

Everyone's sense of what's funny and what isn't is different, so this will definitely not appeal to EVERYONE.

This film is full of gags and would be jokes that bomb (pun intended). As a matter of fact the only funny scene in this movie is the introduction which is a clever parody of Spielberg's own ""Jaws"".  It's a shame really, considering this movie starred such big names of the day such as John Belushi, John Candy, Dan Ackroyd, Tim Matheson, and others.
But enough of bashing a movie that's already been bashed to death.

If there is anyone who wants to see this movie out of sheer curiosity, they might as well skip this disc.  The DVD is presented not in anamorphic widescreen but in letter box, which means if you have a high definition television the black bars at the top at bottom will take up about half the screen leaving a squat, yet wide picture.  Also, the picture sound quality are dismal and flat screen TV's will pick up all the flaws, making this movie look like a VHS movie recorded off a TV station on the EP mode.  This is a bad movie on even a work disc.

57873,5,0783231032,"All I can say is, this is an incredibly well-made movie. Well, not ALL, but this  still is very well-made. I watched this again last night, and fortunately, I got the expanded version this time. I bought the original release on tape a long time ago, and good as it is, it's still missing something. The ""Collector's Edition"" is the full-length release. Yes, it's a very long movie, but it's such an epic of excess, being almost two and a half hours long only adds to the nature of it.

I tend to stay away from All-Star extravaganzas, as the idea of brimming over with celebrities only seems to be a selling point, helpful in ticket and rental sales when the film itself really isn't that good in the first place. Not the case here.

Where to start? Speilberg parodies himself in the first scene by lampooning ""Jaws,"" the girl here accidentally finding a Japanese submarine, instead of a shark. And the roller coaster ride just picks up momentum from there.

It's funny, how in December of 1941, the whole country was worried about Japan and Germany invading the United States, and 60 years later, the country was again on High Alert, this time radical Muslim terrorists are the subject of worry. But judging from what I have heard and read about those days, it would seem the general mood portrayed in the film was accurate. And sadly, people don't seem to be like this anymore. There was, despite infighting, unity against a very dangerous, real enemy. And anymore, the enemy seems to be applauded. Just an opinion. This isn't meant to be a political rant, I just get very angry when I think about Pearl Harbor, the World Trade Center, and where the world has been going lately.

One thing in this movie that jumps out at you, is the over-the-top nature of the whole thing. A stand-out is the choreography in the USO dance contest scene. It has to be seen to be believed. To the person who hasn't seen it: A young man named Wally is involved with a very beautiful girl named Betty Douglas, against her father's wishes. He has been preparing for an upcoming dance contest, but the rules have changed. No civilians this time. The girls are only allowed to dance with soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. Wally refuses to put on a uniform, hence he's a civilian, but still manages to gain admission. A soldier, nicknamed ""Stretch,""  complete bully and very boorish in his demeanor, decides Betty is the girl for him. So when Betty throws him over for Wally at the dance contest, a humiliated Stretch decides to exact a pound-of-flesh retaliation. A fight ensues, and the damage to the club, and ultimately Hollywood Boulevard, is simply jaw-dropping. But watching Stretch chase Wally all over the dance floor, is one of the best sequences you will see anywhere. Among the dancing is a violent confrontation, a disaster waiting to happen.

There are many sub-plots in 1941, and detractors say it's too many elements pulling it too many ways at once. I don't agree. True, there is an awful lot going on, and it can overwhelm one, but look at the scenario in the story. Southern California is in a state of High Alert, the whole country was trying to recover from the Pearl Harbor attack, Hitler was still in power, and everyone was simply galvanized with emotion. How the film makers still managed to make a movie with such a premise contain humor, is an achievement. It contains comedy, action, a dance scene, romance, violence, and family life. It is a vey mixed bag, but some things go so far before you realize it's intentional; it's supposed to overwhelm you.

And, this is a very politically incorrect film. The language itself, probably wouldn't fly today. Calling Japanese people ""Japs,"" ""Slant-eyes,"" and ""Yellow,"" were standard fare at that time. Here we have Japs, Krauts, you name it. I don't celebrate racism, far from it, but even more, I decry political correctness. This film is to be seen as a time piece, and this is how people talked, acted, and thought at the time.

To whit, I say, if you haven't seen this movie, it would be worth your time to watch it, but be warned; this edition, the superior one, is almost two-and-a-half hours long. If you have, and like it, I'm preaching to the choir. If you don't like it, that's your opinion, we all have our tastes, but I really don't know how someone could not like it.",1193788800,2,4335,4.641460234680574
57874,3,0783231032,This movie has many of my favourite comedic actors such as Dan Ackroyd and John Candy. It also has the great Toshiro Mifune who starred in the great Akira Kurosawa classics. There is no real plot to speak of. It is simply a series of comedic sketches loosely tied together. The whole movie seems to make fun of the old Japan - US rivalry and the silliness this paranoia instilled in the population (remember the internment camps?). The film is silly and you have to enjoy silliness (like me) if you're going to like it.,1193097600,2,519,4.473684210526316
57875,3,0783231032,"Spielberg's blockbuster comedy 1941 never really caught on in the US and was better received in other parts of the world. The basic plot of the movie revolves around a real incident which actually took place in early 1942 instead of Christmas 1941. It involved a reported sighting of Japanese aircraft over Los Angeles and led to pandemonium and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition being fired into the night sky for nothing. Spielberg and his writers take this as a springboard for some serious slapstick and special effects on a grand scale.

Featuring John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, Robert Stack and Warren Oates, the cast is very strong and topped off with the hilarious combination of Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee as a Japanese-speaking sub commander and a German-speaking Kriegsmarine officer who seem to either understand each other or not, depending on your take. The support cast is all good though there are a few dull moments in the story line.

This film, more than any other by Spielberg, seems to have copped a merciless bagging over the years, probably because of its theme. It is mass hysteria evolving into huge street fights, aerial dog fights and land and sea gun fights which might not be everyone's cup of tea but in this day and age it is particularly relevant and perhaps would be more widely appreciated. On the other hand, it was made during the Cold War and it wasn't as appealing as ""The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming!"", which itself would have been a good film but for a terrible ending.

Given how nervous the world is today, it might be a good time to show it again.

The DVD is terrible. It is optimised for 4:3 letterbox so those with widescreen TVs get a tiny 2.35:1 picture which is okay if you can see it. Zooming your TV makes it look worse. The audio quality is pretty poor and there are some parts which are quite noticeably distorted.

57877,4,0783231032,"1941 was one of the most underrated comedies ever. Now I will be honest, this is not an award winner by any means. The plot goes nowhere and is scattered all over the place. However the actors in the film make some of the most memorable characters in movie history! The late, great John Belushi is perfectly cast as the highly unstable Capt. Wild Bill Kelso.(Although his lack of screen time is dissapointing.) Belushi gives one of his best performances in the role. Other highlights are all of the scenes involving the Japanese submarine crew and their captain( another brillant performance by the legendary Toshiro Mifune), Robert Stack as the general trying to hold everyone together in this time of panic. And of course the hilarious scenes involving Ned Beatty fireing from his front yard onto the Japanese submarine! I laugh everytime I watch that part. I felt that the DVD suffers from the addtional scenes that were added back in. While watching the movie I could see why they were cut. They are pretty much pointless to the rest of the film and are not the least bit funny. If you watch this movie just take the time to look at each individual storyline and you will see the humor in it and find it quite enjoyable. If you try to figure out how they are all going to tie in together and figure out the entire plot, then you are in for some real dissapointment. One of the special features I thought was entertaining was the reprints of the reviews that critics gave this film when it was released. Wow! Its a good thing Steven Speilberg had Jaws to help him out before this because he got no mercy from the critics on this one!

57878,1,0783231032,"As with another user who wrote in a review, I found this in a discount bin at Wal-Mart. I'd always been aware of the movie, at least from a musical point of view, because John Williams recorded the march and ""Swing! Swing! Swing!,"" his Benny Goodman pastiche, when he was with the Boston Pops Orchestra. (Both are wonderful pieces of music.) But I'd never seen the film. Now I wish I hadn't.

I'm sorry, but this thing misfires in almost every gag. There are some wonderful concepts here, and some hysterical situations (in both senses of the word). And some fine slapstick visuals. But the whole thing is so incredidbly heavy-handed and forced that whatever humor should have been there is crushed to death. In his comments in the bonus material for this DVD (taken quite obviously from a laser-disc version released many years ago), even Spielberg admits that the film should have been funnier. I'll see his bet and raise it: It should have been funny.

Laurel & Hardy could have done the destruction bit in far less time and on a shoestring budget and it would have been funny. The same thing happened a few years ago with a film called MOUSE HUNT, in which an entire mansion is destroyed. Again, L&H did it better in less time. Woody Allen, I believe, once said that any comedy over 90 minutes is doomed to failure. A ""comedy"" like this, running two hours and 20-some minutes, is sheer torture.",1182297600,13,1398,4.610441767068273

57898,1,0783231032,"Watching ""1941"" made me proud to be an American.  It wasn't the movie that made me feel that way.  It was the knowledge that it was a massive flop in this country.  I never realized the American public had such good taste.

Here we have a movie with no fully sympathetic characters whatsoever.  (The Dan Aykroyd and Robert Stack characters and the Italian civil defense guy come closest; unfortunately, the Italian guy's wife is an extremely offensive stereotype.)  The protagonist (played by Bobby Di Cicco) is a young American man who doesn't want to join the military in the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor; the movie never delves into his life and background enough to make his attitude comprehensible or sympathetic.  (All we get is a single line stating that he doesn't want to take orders, which is presumably enough for Hollywood liberals.)

Over the two hours plus of the movie the characters cause millions of dollars worth of property damage in Los Angeles without actually accomplishing anything to justify all the destruction.  If someone -- anyone, but preferably either Bobby Di Cicco's or John Belushi's character -- had succeeded in sinking the Japanese sub, there would have been some point to this movie.  There's a place in the world for pure comedy without socially redeeming value, but not at this budget level.  The only conceivable message it may send is an anti-American one, as both John Wayne and Charlton Heston reportedly concluded when they read the script.  Wayne begged Spielberg not to make the movie at all, and I think he was on the right track.

""1941"" provides a valuable service to young screenwriters everywhere.  By breaking many of the rules of screenwriting, it demonstrates why those rules are good ones.  No movie that aims for widespread popular appeal should have twenty main characters, none of whom is a true identification figure for the audience.  And every movie should allow at least one of its characters to accomplish something of lasting significance, whether it's saving the world or committing a murder or forging a relationship.  At the end of ""1941"", almost all that's changed is the destruction of a house, an amusement park and some planes and cars.

For audiences in 1979, the most frightening moment in this movie must have been in the last scene, when Aykroyd volunteers for the Burma Road and tells Stack that the ""really big year"" of the war will be 1942.  Seldom has the hint of a sequel been so obvious.  Thanks be to Hollywood that there was no sequel to ""1941"", one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

57913,3,0783231032,"This is the kind of movie for mild Sunday afternoon TV entertainment.  The comedy is nothing spectacular, but the scenery is something to be appreciated.

But, what I really don't like about this film, is how everything looks so foggy.  All smokey and greyed out.  Maybe it was Speilberg's intention to have the California coastline always appear to be in the fog. And so, the one thing that comes with a foggy greyed-out scenery, on the TV screen, is that it appears to be grainy.  So the overall movie is just uninteresting.

Embarrassingly unfunny (which is a shame because of its wonderful cast of classic comic actors), the movie goes on way too long for such a mediocre story, and the picture quality is very unappealing to the eye.  What a disaster for what should have been a fabulous concept film.

I see that it has been re-issued.  Does anyone have the newer release, and does it look any better?  George Lucas was able to change some things on the original ""Star Wars"" Trilogy.  Do you think that Speilberg could remove all that fog and make ""1941"" more colorful?  Or is it understood that this film's re-sale potential just may not be worth the effort?

I would hope that Speilberg would consider doing this while making this one of the first new remastered releases for movies being made into a ""High Definition"" transfer, since basically, up to this point, very few DVD's are as of yet?

When you get a HD TV and the new HD DVD player that will be all the rage this new year (2006), you will soon be replacing your favorite DVD's with new re-issued High Definition Transferred DVD's yet to come, following this new DVD technology.

A better TV (or even a High Definition TV) is not going to make your DVD's look any better.  Most of your DVD's weren't made for High Definition.  So don't rely on that misconception.

Maybe, this film wouldn't sell well alone on Blu-Ray (I'd buy it though), but perhaps it could be sold in a 3-fer like ""Animal House, 1941, and The Blues Brothers."" A great triple feature.  What do you think?",1135468800,,2040,4.570247933884297

But what really depressed me about the Collectors Edition DVD was the poor quality of both video and audio.  The DVD is NON-anamorphic, which would have kept me from purchasing it had I known. On top of that, there's this fuzzy, vaseline-on-the-lens effect to much of it, which I assume was the intent of the filmmakers and not a flaw of the DVD. But it's really pretty distracting now. And even though the DVD has a 5.1 audio track, the audio is distorted and clipped.

The story which focuses on the paranoia in California after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor has too many subplots that aren't all that interesting:  the dancing kids for example or Tim Matheson and Nancy Allen's airplane love scenes; much of what John Belushi does seems forced and added for comic relief that isn't all that funny.  Lots of fun performances though:  Robert Stack as General Stilwell enjoying the movie DUMBO; Slim Pickens' self parodying role as the Christmas tree man; the opening sequence in which the girl who opened Spielberg's JAWS repeats the scene with a submarine standing in for the great white; Lorraine Gary's terror in losing her home and her hatred of guns.  There's lots of spectacular explosions and demolitions and lots of noise; it's a rather noisy movie.  1941 is one of those movies Spielberg probably enjoyed making; too bad the audience could only enjoy the parts instead of the whole.",1131926400,,1195,4.91542288557214

The same goes for all of the actors.  Nothing really gets acomplished.

It's hard to believe that this was an early Steven Speilberg production, but with a stellar cast of lunatics and wannabee lunatics, it certainly hits it's mark. If you enjoyed ""The Blues Brothers"" then you'll have a ball with this movie.

John Belushi is at his maniacal best as Captain ""Wild Bill"" Kelso and receives spirited support from Ned Beatty, Dan Aykroyd, Warren Oates and Slim Pickens.

The standout scenes are the dance-off contest at the USO show, the capture of Hollis T Wood by the Japanese, and the ferris wheel observation post.

A cult movie that did not receive the acclaim of the previously mentioned ""Blues Brothers"" or ""Animal House"" but a better production overall thanks to Spielberg's talents.",1127088000,3,764,5.0476190476190474
57919,3,0783231032,"It's easy to write-off ""1941"" as a horrible failure among the jewels of Spielberg's early big stuff (""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters"", ""E.T."" & ""Raiders""), which is why you're better off forgetting it's pedigree when tooling it up - and you should watch this flick.

THE PLOT: to the extent that there is one, ""1941"" tells the story of frantic Californians in the manic Christmas following the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Beginning with a scene that parodies the skinny-dipping victim in ""Jaws"", ""1941"" boasts John Belushi as ""Wild Bill"" Kelso, a fighter pilot who can't read a map; Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee as the Japanese and German officers in charge of a German built/Japanese owned Submarine prowling off the Pacific coast; Ned Beatty as a gun-crazy patriarch who's home has been selected to quarter a shore-defense artillery cannon; Nancy Allen as a woman in love (and lust) with airplanes; John Candy and Dan Akroyd as the improbably Canadian-sounding crew of an American tank, Robert Stack as the last sane man left alive in California, Warren Oates, various zoot-suiters, maniacs, Japanese sailors and other characters trapped in period clothing.  It's not really successful as comedy (though there was a bit with Eddie Deezen on a Ferris wheel that nearly killed me), and there's no chance that this is effective drama - the characters are too thin, and the plot-lines never really compliment each other.  While there's a great line that hints of the burgeoning racial problems at home, the heartbreaking fear that would faced by some, and the coming internment of the American Japanese are barely hinted.  This would be strong stuff were it made today (the nerve of somebody poking fun at ""The Greatest Generation""!), but much of the poking is scattershot.

WHY YOU MIGHT STILL ENJOY IT: Because it's fun.  There's no forgetting that this flick taps into deep reservoirs of fear and the exuberance of the coming war as an outlet for adventure.

1941 is not the funniest film ever made, but it's loud, wild and zany, which makes it a lot of fun to watch.  The opening parody on his own JAWS with Christine Blakely is especially original.

What made this film work at the time (1979), I think, was its cast of stars, who were all fresh off of some very popular work at the time, including films like ANIMAL HOUSE, JAWS 2, SUPERMAN, and TV shows like SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, EIGHT IS ENOUGH and BOSOM BUDDIES.

So much so that he made 1941.

I was in high school when it came out and I can't tell you how much I looked forward to seeing it: Belushi, Aykroyd, John Candy, Spielberg and huge budget of special effects.  How could it NOT work?

But it didn't.  I even went back to see it again, wondering if I'd just MISSED all the laughs.

The first thing I noticed was that the timing was completely off.  The camera doesn't let go of anyone who screams.  The characters are all buffoons.  Like CADDYSHACK, the main characters are uninteresting but, unlike CADDYSHACK, the real comedians don't break out in their scenes.

Maybe Rodney Dangerfield should have been General Stillwell.

1941 has its moments.  Belushi has a great entrance.  Uber-dork Eddie Deezen's ventriloquist dummy spotting the Jap sub is funny.  Aykroyd donning pany hose and two oranges to declare, ""I'm a bug!""

Unfortunately, those moments are too few.  Most of the time, I wouldn't think, ""That was funny.""  I thought, ""Wow, that looked expensive.""

Because, I've come to believe that Spielberg has become possibly our greatest American director and I thought maybe I had missed something in this early work. Guess what? I didn't. The movie has a number of great actors in it's cast but there is so much mayhem and screaming going on that they get lost in the shuffle. The movie's nominal star, John Belushi, plays what is essentially a pale shadow of his ""Bluto"" role in Animal House. The movie's obvious inspiration is ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World"" but ""1941"" makes that film look like a drawing-room comedy. However, do I recommend this movie? Well, there are a few laughs amid the chaos and if you are interested in the development of Spielberg's career(this is not his worst movie;that honor goes to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"").

 Also, if you are interested in the career of Robert Zemeckis, he co-scripted this film.",1091750400,2,1199,4.650943396226415
57938,5,0783231032,"But I think that's what works in this film! Although a lot of critics have given this film thumbs down remarks and bad reviews, I for one enjoy it. When reading a biography on Stephen Spielberg, I discovered that he had planned on turning the second world war into HIS version of my all-time favorite film, It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. The poster art done for the film is pure ""Mad World"". It depicts every single character from the film be it major, minor, or extra, and it shows action shots of things you can see in the movie; Murray Hamilton and Eddie Deezen on the ferris wheel with the Dummy, a theater marquee announcing Walt Disney's Dumbo playing, and of course Captain Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi) flying his airplane directly towards the audience.

 In my opinion, Spielberg stood true to his word and did in fact give audiences ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World...War"". Originally, he was going to call the film ""The Night The Japs Attacked"" but of course, that title wouldn't be accepted by most companies. 1941 contains exactly the kind of material that was seen in ""Mad World""; a cavalcade cast that included (In Alphabetical Order) Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Belushi, Lorraine Garay, Murray Hamilton, Christopher Lee, Tim Matheson, Toshir Mifune, Warren Oates, Robert Stack, Treat Williams and classic minor roles performed by Lucille Benson, John Candy, Elisha Cook Jr., Eddie Deezen, Patti LuPone, Penny Marshall, Frank McRae, Slim Pickens, Wendie Jo Sperber, Lionel Stander, Dub Taylor, Iggie Wolfington, Joe Flaherty, David L. Lander, Michael McKean, Susan Backlinie, Mickey Rourke, and Donovan Scott.

 Most people forget that there's a big love triangle in the story involving Bobby DiCicco and Dianne Kay and how they must deal with Treat Williams' harshness and rudeness. That's probably because Spielberg had filmed so much that the audience couldn't decide which characters were more important to focus on! Hence why when the film was first released on video, it only ran 2 hours long and was billed as a ""HOME VIDEO VERSION"".

 When the DVD was re-released in 2003, there were a few minor changes. The DVD disc itself remained 100% the same as it did when it arrived on shelves in 1998, however the re-release changed the cover art and replaced the expansive collectible booklet that was placed inside the cover with a smaller ""Chapters & Bonus Features"" insert instead.

 The Director's Cut of the film really adds more depth to the plot lines. The DVD was essentially put together in the same format as the ""Universal Signature Collection"" Laserdisc of 1941. It includes the newly restored 2.35:1 Scope Widescreen presentation of the film with all 26 minutes of cut footage intact and in widescreen as well, a restored Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound audio track, 2 teaser trailers (the 1st one allows audiences to discover that Belushi's name was originally going to be Wild WAYNE Kelso) and 1 theatrical trailer, an extra collection of unrestored deleted scenes (some of which are missing audio) and outtakes, a documentary featuring interviews with Stephen Spielberg, Bob Gale, Robert Zemeckis, John Milius, and John Williams, within the documentary are on-set home movies done by Spielberg and alternate takes not included in the deleted scenes section, a photo gallery, and advertising campaign gallery. Among the ""Text Only"" bonus features are production notes and reviews of the film from 1978-1979.

 As I said earlier, most people hated this film because of the millions of characters and plot lines but to me I consider it almost a cult classic. Like Dr. Strangelove, it took on a serious American issue and made it into a farce, giving people something to smile and laugh at. Therefore, 1941 in my opinion deserves 5 stars.

57949,4,0783231032,"The reverential tone Steven Spielberg has taken lately with World War II as evident in ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (in addition to the 1987 boys' adventure ""Empire Of The Sun"") is nowhere to be found in this largely panned yet outrageously entertaining screwball comedy that would have done Blake Edwards proud.

 Based loosely on events that actually occurred stateside during World War II (specifically the sighting of a Japanese submarine off the coast of California and the infamous ""zoot suit riots"" among day-glo dressed street hoods and servicemen), this movie pays tribute to the paranoia that gripped the West Coast in the days following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Notoriously overbudget, this film was considered the ""Waterworld"" of its day, with the obvious difference being that it took itself not the least bit seriously. It was Spielberg's much-expected flop in the wake of ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind""...but did it deserve to be?

 An able cast of comedic talent headlined by the incomparable John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd with up-and-coming SCTV alumnus John Candy and recent ""Animal House"" veteran Tim Matheson supported ably by character actors Ned Beatty, Robert Stack, Treat Williams, and Lorraine Gary and all-time good ol' boy Slim Pickens on one side...and veteran Hammer Films horror star Christopher Lee slumming with Akira Kurosawa's number-one samurai Toshiro Mifune and the crew of a Japanese submarine with faulty navigational equipment on the other.

 It is an all-star cast performing well up to its own high standard in what would be the most unusual twist on war since ""Hogan's Heroes""...mainly the notion that this tragedy which brought so much pain and sorrow to the entire world could in fact be something that, in the right hands, could be uproariously funny. Spielberg's fingerprints are of course ubiquitous; the use of children, the collaboration with John Williams, breakaway stuntwork, special effects and well-designed set pieces...but it is the actors that make this movie work, particularly John Belushi who, like Brad Pitt in movies like ""Thelma & Louise"", ""True Romance"", and ""Snatch"" manages to steal completely a movie in which he actually has very little face time. All the actors are encouraged to play to their strengths, and the ability to ""pay no attention to that man behind the curtain"" (i.e., remember than none of this ever happened and that this is a comedy, not a documentary...Michael Moore, are you listening?) will enable the viewer some deep bellylaughs and some time well-spent viewing the bonus features which attempt to explain just WHY this is one of Spielberg's least understood or appreciated films.",1090800000,55,2731,5.223744292237443

I have to say that the worst thing that happened to this film is that Speilberg directed it and has his imprint all over the film, which should have been a darker comedy than it turned out to be. However, you wouldn't have had the cast that wound up being in the film (early appearances of Ackroyd, John Candy and Mickey Rourke in film, and Bob Zemeckis' first real break into film), a nod to Kurosawa (Toshiro Mifume is the sub captain), Speilberg's own ""Duel"", and to Kubrick (Slim Pickens from Dr. Strangelove shows up). Considering John Belushi did few films, it's worth having on that alone. The dance sequences and cinematography are definitely worth the awards they would wind up picking up.
The film can overwhelm you a bit and confuse you, but that was the point. However, there's a lot in the film that can be applied in 2004, like Robert Stack's character (think Rumsfeld). Had Zemeckis had the pull to make what he envisioned it to be, it would have been a classic black comedy without a doubt,although in Europe it always has been.",1083110400,4,1117,4.480392156862745

57952,4,0783231032,"1941 really is one of those movies you love or hate and you hate to love. It really is a movie with no plot and character development. It has a ton of crazy and wild characters that are very memorable. The story really isn't important because there really isn't one.
1941 is a movie that takes place on Dec. 13, 1941 in L.A., Cal. The U.S. people are worried about another attack from the Japanese. Off the coast of L.A. is a Japanese U-Boat with the dumbest crew ever and one Nazi on it. They end up there off the coast because they are lost and their instruments won't work. Back on shore you have tank crew with characters played by Dan Akroyd, John Candy and Treat Williams in it who are out defending the city. You have John Belushi patroling the skies as Wild Bill and plenty of othe memorable characters living there daily lives in this war time.
Like I said it really is hard to try to tell you the plot because there are so many chatacters and so many things going on at one time. There are plenty of cameos and funny antics in the movie. I like watching spoof movies like this and it's funny to see it come from Steven Spielberg because he's made some of the best dramas of all-time. If you were to see Schindler's List, The Color Purple, and Saving Private Ryan and then you were to see 1941, there is no way you'd think Spielberg did it.
I was disapointed in the movie for the roles of John Belushi and Dan Akroyd. Because there are so many characters in the movie it's hard for anybody to get a ton of time on camera. At the time this movie was made these guys were both pretty popular from SNL and I think Spielberg really could have ran with them.
I was disappointed with the DVD quality of the picture. It doesn't look any better than any of the previous versions I've seen of 1941. The bonus features however are great and the price for the movie is well worth that alone.
1941 really is a fun movie. It's fun to see a guy like Spielberg do a spoof like this. Just him making fun of Jaws is great. It's not that bad of a movie and I really am glad I own it.",1081900800,2,2074,4.161691542288557
57953,4,0783231032,"After seeing the extended version and basically watching 1941 for the first time in over 10 years, I must admit, it's rather foolish, but I think that was the whole idea.  It was a throwback to all those star-studden slapstick comedies that Spielberg and Zemekis grew up watching.  It's not racist in anyway.  It would have been if JUST the Japanese were portrayed as bumblers, but everyone in this movie is nuts.  After the Anthrax scares following Sept. 11 (remember those), I think a movie like 1941 should be appreciated more.  It takes a paranoids to a new level.  yes, people were scared and the movie, which writer Bob Gale says lifted some truths, shows just how America was sixty years ago.  Yes, it's a screaming movie.  On the closing credits, every actor is screaming or yelling.  After seeing how hard the filmmakers worked on the special features, you got to appreciate the movie. Also, some deleted scenes add more, such as the racial tension between John Candy and Frank McCrae that is just touched on in the original is extended so we know why they're fighting in the tank anyway.  It's an anti-war movie that decides to have fun of the Greatest Generation.  And it does have Mickey Rourke before he got corrupted.  Also, the Jaws spoof at the beginning is terrific.",1080691200,,1283,4.7040358744394615

When I first saw the movie, I found it hilarious that I barely understood why it was a flop at the box office.  As a matter of fact I still do.  Now comes the expanded director's cut of this so-called ""comedy spectacular"".  Hey, new scenes, new dialogue -I have no problem with that.  Once again, I have to criticize it because these new developments make the film longer and a bit boring.  The only new scene that I really enjoyed from this cut is when the Japanese soldiers are disguised as Christmas trees, and there is Hollis Wood (Slim Pickens) trying to cut them down -now that was hilarious.
In general terms, I love the ""Jaws"" spoof when the same girl who was attacked in Steven Spielberg's first hit is attacked by...gulp!...a sub periscope.  I also love the screaming when Wild Bill Kelso's (John Belushi) planes crashes down on Hollywood Boulevard.  I like many things about this movie.  However, as I said before, Spielberg's cut of the movie is somewhat dull.
As for the special features, I have to say that the ""Making Of"" documentary is insightful, but a bit long -was that necessary to record every Bob Gale detail regarding whatever happened after the attack on Pearl Harbor?  Interesting deleted scenes, some of them without audio.  Finally, I really love the isolated track of John Williams' spectacular music score.

The Americans, in the meantime, are dealing with anti-Japanese hysteria, insane fighter pilots, well-meaning (but destructive) tankers, and riots between Army soldiers and Navy sailors.
The movie is quite funny, but it's just too long.  Comedies shouldn't last for more than an hour and half, two hours at the most, but 1941 drags on for nearly 3 hours.

Having said that, the film is still enjoyable, and the humor often works well when it appears.  Large scale production and well-filmed miniatures combine for a spectacular visual feast.

The film is one of Spielberg's very few comedies, chronicling the adventures of a group of citizens and soldiers in 1941 California, who fear they'll be next.  Spielberg's directing is nothing special, an extremely rare occurence; Robert Zemeckis' and Bob Gale's script has some of the most unfunny circumstances made into attempted comedy; John Williams' score is great, but as with Spielberg, nothing great; there's also some wacky cinematography by William A. Fraker.  Some of the main members of an outstanding cast include Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, Christopher Lee, Tim Matheson, Murray Hamilton, Lorraine Gary, Robert Stack, Treat Williams, Warren Oates, and Slim Pickens.  Of course, the true highlight of the film is John Belushi, who never lets us down for laughs.  As a matter of fact, Belushi may be the only good part of the film in his role as a crazed war pilot.  While true war historians and the like may think that the occurences upon which the film is inspired are nothing to be made fun of (I myself feel the same), 1941 isn't a total waste, as unfunny as it is.

I personally believe it would have been much better had John(the man) Landis Directed it, and if Belushi, Akroyd, and Matheson had more screen time. Belushi's Patton Spoof could have been analyzed further through flashbacks etc. but all in all this is a must for any John Belushi Fan.

For what it's worth, I wasn't entirely impressed with it when it came out, but I'm a huge Aykroyd and Belushi fan, so I enjoyed it a bit more than the average person.  As years passed, I realized (along with a lot of other people), that this was not really a bad movie.
In retrospect, it's got quite a few good moments and it's worth seeing again with an open mind.

The plot, along with it's allstar cast is really extremely enjoyable. It's a week after the attacks of Pearl Harbor, histeria has hit the west coast, for fear of another attack. Things get so out of control, that most of the caos come from misunderstandings, our own planes and war nerves create total panic and ruin in some parts of L.A.

57975,4,0783231032,"I have to admit; I love 1941.  There's some insane part of me that gets a cheap thrill from watching Hollywood Boulevard being destroyed by a bunch of total morons.  1941 may not be a great movie, but then again, no one was expecting it to be GONE WITH THE WIND.  It's just an insane comedy that I happen to love.
The film has several different plots, all of which come crashing together during the last hour and a half of the movie.  The Japanese, parked off the coast of California in a large Japanese submarine, make plans to blow up Hollywood.  They are led by Japanese commander Commander Mitamura (played by Toshiro Mifune) and Nazi Captain Vonkleinschmidt (played by Christopher Lee).  Back on land, Wally (Bobby DiCicco), aided by best friend Dennis (Perry Lang), hopes to win the jitterbug contest with Betty Douglas (Diane Kay), who is chased around by serviceman Chuck ""Stretch"" Sitarski (Treat Williams).  Betty's friend Maxine (Wendy Jo Sperber) lusts after Sitarski, and Betty's father Ward (Ned Beatty) recieves an anti-aircraft gun that bears a striking resemblance to an army tank.  Meanwhile, General's aide Loumis Birkhead (Tim Matheson) lusts after Donna Stratton (Nancy Allen), who is turned on by planes.  And bursting through all of this is loud and crude nutcase pilot Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi) who makes it his business to blow everything up.
The first hour or so is far more calm than the last hour and a half.  During this, writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale (who went on to do BACK TO THE FUTURE) set up all the characters and plot lines, not all of which I have mentioned yet.  The gags are slowly milked out to their fullest extent, and Slim Pickens has a funny role as a drunk captured by the Japanese  The last hour and a half, however, is a blast in the face of music, sound and imagry.  There's lots to see here; a ferris wheel rolling off a peir, with two guys (Murray Hamilton, Eddie Deezen and Deezen's wooden dummy) on top of it; Beatty's wife Lorraine Gary watching in horror as he drives a tank through their home; and, of course, Kelso and all the others blowing up half of Hollywood Boulevard while General Stillwell (Robert Stack) watches DUMBO in the local theatre.
The music by John Williams is unforgettable, hummable and, as usual, absolutely perfect.  The visual effects are amazing for their time, and even more amazing when you consider the fact that they're better than most of today's computer effects.  All the technichal elements in the film are superb.
Will you like this movie?  I don't know.  I did, but then again, my sense of humor isn't exactly sophisticated.  I thought 1941 was crazy fun, but don't see it if you have weak ears, and if you have the volume on high, brace yourself.  The last hour and a half is basically people screaming and stuff blowing up, and it's LOUD.  But I still found 1941 to be, in a goofy way, loud and insane fun.
The DVD is great.  There's an excellent 110 minute documentary on the making of the film, and no wonder it's excellent; it was directed by documentary maker extraordinaire Laurent Bozereau.  By the way, the cut on the disc is an extended cut that has about 26 minutes of extra footage.  I don't remember the original version well enough to comment on the difference however.  Also included are excellent production notes, great photo galleries, three fun trailers (the first of which has specially prepared footage), original reviews (which are, for the most part, really, really nasty), and some interesting deleted scenes.  Also, Universal has graciously cut the movie up into 60 (!) different chapters.  Talk about packaging!
It may not be a classic, and it may not really be about anything besides stuff getting destroyed, but 1941 is still VERY, VERY FUNNY.  I recommend it both for the movie and this EXCELLENT DVD.",1050192000,2,3832,4.723308270676692

Not to say that the film dosn't have it's moments, but the sum of it's parts works better than the movie as a whole. As Spielberg protege said: ""Steven's direction was brilliant, the idea was terrible."" Which pretty much sums up the whole film. But repeated viewings of this rather haphazard comedy shows that there are some clever comedic set-pieces, the film rests squarley on large-scale effects and screaming comedy, which is hardly cohesive. Dan Akroyd is good, as are the rest of the cast including John Belushi, Christopher Lee, Toshiro Mifune, Robert Stack, John Candy and Treat Williams. But the impressive cast gets swamped by the overly-loud visuals. This is also the one time when John Williams' brass, strident score hampers the film by making it even louder. Highlights include Wild Bill Kelso (Belushi)'s anitcs, the audacious attack on the amusement park and a large Ferris wheel falling into the sea. It's actually not as bad as what critics thought when the film had it's uncertain release in 1979, but not that good when compared to his best work.

Until one day, I was looking around in a video store when I saw the old VHS box standing in front of me. Since I had nothing to really do that night, I said ""What the Hell?"" and rented it.

Steven Spielberg's direction in this movie can be compared to some of the type of direction of today's big budget films (i.e Armageddon). The movie is noteworthy for the fact that it boasts an all-star cast including Tishiro Mifune, Christopher Lee (as a German officer on board the Japanese sub as a guest), stars from SNL, Second City, and stars from tv sitcoms of the 1970's. Also, it's one of the few movies John Belushi did before his untimely death. There are a lot of people screaming, great special effects and stunts, and some outrageous characters.  The plot is mainly about a Japanese submarine that is off course, arriving in the L.A. harbor, and causing hysteria among the L.A residences. With that, there are related subplots such as Belushi's Wild Bill Kelso flying an airplane to L.A. and Ned Beatty's Ward Douglas receiving an anti-aircraft gun from the army to be placed on his beachfront backyard. Some standout supporting performances from Bobby Di Cicco as Wally Stephens, an unlisted man whose only joy is to dance in his zoot suit, and Dianne Kay (from TV's EIGHT IS ENOUGH) as his girlfriend.  These two (along with Robert Stack as General Stillwell) are the ""calm in the hurricane"" or the only sane people in this movie.  The rest are all too cartoony and over the top. This is the type of movie to watch as background noise if you are doing other things like writing your bills, doing your homework, or surfing the net. You can look up occasionally to catch something for a chuckle or two.

58003,2,0783231032,"Every film maker, at some point, has a big flop in his time.  Some of them have more, many more.  Steven Spielberg is lucky to have had only two of them.
That said, however, ""1941"" is still not a very good film.  This is the only film of Spielberg's (aside from the equally bloated HOOK) that I could do without in my video collection.  It is loosely based on a wave of war hysteria that broke out in Los Angeles when a Japanese sub was spotted off the coast (an event that actually took place in February 1942; the story backdates it to a week after the Pearl Harbor attack).
Starting from a (presumably) hysterically funny screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale (who would later do BACK TO THE FUTURE), with help from right-wing gung-ho schlockmeister John Milius, Spielberg assembled a huge cast of stars: Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Belushi, John Candy, Nancy Allen, Tim Matheson, Treat Williams, Robert Stack, Warren Oates, Slim Pickens, Lionel Stander, Dub Taylor, and many, many more.  He also got a first-rate technical crew with him, which resulted in ""1941"" picking up three Oscar nominations.  And there are certainly explosions, sight gags, jitterbug dances, facial mugging, and fight scenes by the score.
The problem, however, is that very little of it is actually FUNNY.  Isn't that what comedy is supposed to be?!  A lot of other reviewers here said that they laughed their heads off.  I won't dissuade them from feeling that way, but all I can say is that I didn't.  This wasn't an out-and-out laugh riot like AIRPLANE!; and if it was intended to be a political satire, it fell way short of the mark.  There are laughs in it, but it never manages to be consistently funny from start to finish.

The movie is awesome; a lot of know talent and ""legends"" of our time.  Absolutely funny from the moment it starts to the end.
As I understand, unfortunately this one was not very popular when it came out.  I have invited friends and family to watch it and they have walked away laughing at all the silliness.
For a few good laughs, I highly recommend this one!",995760000,,431,4.180722891566265

All in good rolls in excellent comedy movie about my favorite war!  I must have!  So I buy collectors edition DVD.  So many features!  Such a good buy!,981936000,,304,4.363636363636363
58006,3,0783231032,"Yes, the general consensus is that this movie is terrible.  But this is simply not true.  It may not be comparable to the rest of the Speilberg canon, but thats where the first mistake lies in judging this film.  Its a big dumb comedy filled with slapstick, pratfalls and belly laughs, its not designed to be anything else.  If anyone but Spielberg directed this it would've been better received, I'm sure.  Methinks the wolves were sharpening their knives back in '79, waiting for a glitch in the armor.  That said, John Belushi's histrionics tend to grate, and the Tim Matheson/Nancy Allen subplot is just plain stupid, but thankfully this is an ensemble comedy, and these bits are just small parts of the whole.  As for the DVD, the film looks great, and the bonus materials will give you more info than you ever thought you could handle about the making of 1941.  The making of documentary is feature length in its own right, and it doesnt try to hide the fact that the film was badly received.  In fact, a large portion of the special features Speilberg rightly defending it against its many detractors, explaining that he thinks that its funny. So do I.",979430400,3,1159,4.642156862745098

58008,5,0783231032,"This is undisputably the most hilarious movie I've ever seen!  It starts  off with sporatical spurts of poignant humor, the intervals further apart  at first, then growing ever more intense and close together as the movie  progresses.
It's a fantastical story of Hollywood, California in the  first days following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941.  The paranoia of  the military, the citizens, and various zealots combine gradually  throughout course of the film, and climax to an explosive burst of pure  comedy!
Watch this movie - you'll laugh til you have tears in your eyes -  you'll bust a gut!",969062400,5,602,4.93
58009,4,0783231032,"""1941"" is not a simple farce, but a hilarious, carefully  constructed, and well-targeted screwball comedy. The Seventies were short  on these -- ""What's Up, Doc?"" comes to mind, but almost nothing  else. Steven Spielberg really did bake a comic souffle, with almost every  ""SNL"" and ""SCTV"" veteran and character actor he could  find to keep it lively.
You couldn't tell that any of this was coherently  told, though, until now. The widescreen VHS (and DVD) versions add 26  minutes of footage, and it all is worth watching. It turns what others have  called a mere ""scream-fest"" into its own demented, alternate  world-for-a-day, hemmed in by comic paranoia.
Other reviews have noted  that this story took from historical events, such as an actual appearance  of a Japanese sub, and the ""zoot suit"" riots of the following  year. But what hasn't been noted are the comic rhythms that Spielberg was  trying to use. They simply weren't visible until now.
Not only does the  restored version put back over 20 minutes of one of John Williams's  wittiest scores, but several items that were repeated throughout the film  get those repetitions back. This makes all the difference for comic effect.  The earlier video version was funny, but left you tired. This one, though,  leaves you wrung out from being swept up in it ... and that's a much more  satisfying feeling.
Here are some of the items that gain comic brilliance  through many more witty and well-placed repetitions, only now restored in  this director's cut:
""If there's one thing I can't stand, it's  Americans fighting Americans."" ~ ""I hate eggs."" ~ The RKO  Pictures talent scout. ~ ""Just a case of war nerves."" ~ The two  USO girls' manhunting. ~ ""This will NEVER work."" ~ White vs.  black on the tank crew (not that pleasant to see, but historically  accurate, and damn funny). ~ ""Dumbo,"" adjective and film. ~  ""Deep in the Heart of Texas,"" sung (!) by John Belushi at  hilarious moments (and kept out of the video until now due to copyright  problems).
Some scenes and characters only make sense with the added  footage:
Wally, the zoot-suiter, hiding in the rafters of the garage, a  perfectly built ""topper"" gag. ~ Why the zoot-suiters are around  that night, for that matter. ~ Wally being ""other side of the  tracks"" and proving himself in battle on Hollywood Boulevard. ~ Cpl.  Sitarsky's easily triggered rage. ~ The tank crew, again. ~  Beginning-and-ending gags about ""tearing out some walls."" ~ How  and why the two Civil Defense guys on the ferris wheel drive each other  crazy. ~ Tim Matheson's airborne seduction.
It isn't the same film that  had appeared before on video, that's all there is to it. The night-and-day  difference in repeated comic elements, alone, is worth five stars. I only  deduct one for the same thing that drove me crazy in the theater 20 years  ago: Too many explosions!",968284800,16,2868,4.830927835051546
58010,3,0783231032,"Bought this one simply because I am a fan of the director and have a Spielberg collection.  One of his lesser efforts, ""1941"" is the  perfect example of a bloated budget, wasted talent, a ""comedy""  with few laughs, and an idea that probably seemed like a good one at the  time.
I assure you, it was not!",967852800,2,303,4.2631578947368425

John Belushi really steals every scene he's in. The physical  comedy of John's is missed alot. Dan Aykroyd is always fantastic. With his  fast talking,and all of a sudden some word comes out that blows you away. I  also enjoy Treat Williams and his hatred of Eggs. I also can't stand the  taste,touch,or smell of an Eggs.

58012,2,0783231032,"I began collecting DVDs recently and the only disc I regret buying thus far is 1941.  You see, I was tempted by the exhaustive extras and the chance to see Spielberg's director's cut.  Don't fall into the same trap,  dear readers.  This film is bad.  I got as far as 25 minutes in and decided  I couldn't take anymore.  It's a film which believes that there is a  goldmine of comedy to found in shouting, falling over, and then shouting  again.  Not funny.  If sitting in front of an animated corpse was bad  enough, it turns out the extras are a chore, too - the dullest being a very  long, very boring documentary about the making of the film in which all  involved (who should have known better) recount in nauseating detail how  the film came to be.

There is an all-star cast;Tim Matheson, John  Belushi, Dan Akroyd, and John Candy.

I am always in the mood for a real treat and when I heard that Spielberg made a WWII comedy 2years ago I watched it and laughed my head off again, and again,  and again. However you must be pretty insane to appreciate this film like I  and others do, but I think that the only reason why it did bad in 1979 was  b/c it was ahead of its time. Just think. 1. General Stillwell who is more  concerned with seeing ""DUMBO"" than helping out. 2. Stillwells 2nd  in command who is infatuated with a girl who is sexually intimidated by  planes. 3. 2 guys and a dummy on a ferris wheel which eventually rolls off  a dock. 4.
