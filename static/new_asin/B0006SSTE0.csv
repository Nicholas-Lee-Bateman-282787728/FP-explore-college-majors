There is a sign that warns against going to Deadwood Pass. Six riders enter the pass. A stage coach travels along a road. There is a gang that is based there. Six riders chase the coach and shoot at it. The driver is hit! Tom takes the reins and shoots at the pursuers. The stage arrives in Deadwood. Tom Whitlock is from nowhere and is going there. The newspaper said The Hawk escaped from prison, and may go to Deadwood Pass to recover stolen bonds. A Postal Inspector arrests The Hawk (a tattoo on his hand identifies him). There is a fight, The Hawk is captured. Mileaway offers him a proposition: half of the stolen bonds for his freedom. Its a deal. The Hawk escapes before Sheriff Rawlins arrives. This is part of a ruse so The Hawk can infiltrate the gang. A telegram says the real Hawk escaped and may return to Deadwood Pass. The gang stays in a small cabin.

Butch Cassidy welcomes The Hawk. That Postal Inspector recovers in the Sheriffs home. Mileaway suspects The Hawk may be an impostor, a lawman. But he is shot before he can expose Tom! Who did it? There is a card game and a conflict over the results. Tom will used Butchs hat and coat to go into town. Tom figures out the meaning of that tattoo! He returns to capture the gunmen guarding the pass. The real Hawk recognizes Felipe. But Tom arrives just in time to save Felipe, then they ride off together. That horse returns with a message for the Sheriff. Tom finds and takes the stolen bonds. The gang pursues them. Are they trapped? There is shooting. Felipe takes the horse and bonds to escape. Tom is outnumbered. Tom has a fist fight with Butch, who falls down the hill. The gang is captured. Tom rides off with Betty Rawlins. Will they be happy?

This is a good story and makes a good movie. Could the plot be repeated in another movie? The idea of an outlaw village could be based on an historical fact. Why would a robber take bonds instead of cash? Bonds are harder to cash as they are identifiable, cash is fungible.",1506384000,,2021,4.398395721925134
