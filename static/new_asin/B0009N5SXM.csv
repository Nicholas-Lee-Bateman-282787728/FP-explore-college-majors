8063417,5,B0009N5SXM,"The Danger Rabgers is one animated series I make sure my grandchildren watch. The Danger RangerSeries is about safety, being a good neighbor and respect for others. I always take it further-discussing with my grandkids what they just watched-to be sure they have a clear understanding of what they have seen and heard on the series. We even re-enact some of the scenes together so I can be sure they get it!",1353801600,,407,4.666666666666667

8063419,5,B0009N5SXM,"I bought this after a neighborhood potential 'Amber Alert' situation, as a way of starting to teach my 4yr old and toddler some safety and 'stranger danger' messages without being scary. They love it, and they choose to play it over and over themselves.
The delivery method is so appealing that the kids really enjoy it, and at the same time they are learning safety messages for around the home, in the playground, out in the street. They have remembered the safety lessons, and they love the DVD. We use it as a jumping off point for discussions about safety at home and out and about.",1269820800,,587,4.547169811320755
8063420,4,B0009N5SXM,"I bought this for neighbor friends of mine, and I find it to be a great tool so that they are having fun watching a cartoon while learning various safety rules.  It is neat to go outside and see them put what they learned into action sometimes even quoting the movie.  The whole Danger Ranger collection is great for young people.",1184544000,7,330,4.39344262295082
8063421,5,B0009N5SXM,"This DVD gets my two thumbs up! I viewed it with my 3-yr old daughter over the weekend and couldn't believe the reaction I got from her.  I try to keep our usual viewing to semi-educational shows that help teach values, manners, songs, etc...  This one was right down our alley - she was humming and singing the songs by the second go-round.

These animated superheroes called the Danger Rangers are housed in their secret headquarters (cleverly disguised in the head of George Washington in Mt. Rushmore).  The Danger Rangers are organized by a super computer named SAVO.  The Danger Rangers are alerted when safety oilations are being committed and they rush to the rescue to teach families and children the different safety rules regarding:  home, biking, strangers, calling 911, fire, and pool/water.

Their motto...SAFETY RULES!

This DVD has Spanish and English available on one disc and there are some cute bonus songs such as ""911,"" ""Wheels,"" and ""Rules of the Road"" that have catchy tunes and lyrics to help the kids learn and retain the safety rules.

The viewing range covers a broad age bracket as my 10-yr old also enjoyed sitting with his little sister to watch and sing along.",1180915200,13,1191,4.856435643564357
