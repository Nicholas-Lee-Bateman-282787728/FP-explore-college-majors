8695621,1,B00RNTYK20,"These are three short films which are supposed to be ""cult classics."" The restoration and sound is bad as are the films themselves. The plot makes little sense and one film has shameful anachronisms. Unless you are a Milligan fan, this is not worth it at any price. 3 films on one disc.

 Some minor nudity.",1448236800,,307,4.464285714285714
8695622,1,B00RNTYK20,"I'll admit it. I'm a huge fan of the late Andy Milligan. Even though his films were dialogue-heavy and contained less-than-professional makeup gore effects, there was always something mesmerizing about them, including Milligan's severe distaste for the Catholic church (He was gay and was considered less than a human being from the same church he attended since a child). But even I have to say that this DVD of three of Milligan's films are presented in a way that defame his legacy and are an insult to all his fans all over the world. It's not just that they crammed three of his films on one DVD, but that the prints themselves, even though they are in widescreen, are full of emulsion scratches, a few scenes of artifacts (due to the compression ratio used to cram three films, commentaries, trailers and a Milligan Media Gallery on one DVD) and severe jump cuts, offering all three films in their incomplete state. This is an insult to the estate of Andy Milligan. If you want to see Milligan films done right, buy the Blu-Rays of TORTURE DUNGEON, BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHER and THE MAN WITH TWO HEADS from Code Red. They look better than when I saw them all in theaters in the early 70's. Fred Olen Ray tries to make a buck by riding Code Red coattails, but this is not something you want to watch. Something Weird put out THE GHASTLY ONES in much better condition (even though it was fullscreen) with Milligan's little-seen film SEEDS OF SIN (1968), both in the released theatrical version and a 40-minute workprint, which contains a lot of alternate footage, including a greatly expanded scene of one character's death. If you are not too much of a videophile and want to experience Milligan for the first time, I guess this three-film DVD will do in a pinch since it is so cheap, but fans of Milligan are warned to stay away. The best thing about this DVD is the commentary of THE BODY BENEATH by filmmaker David DeCoteau, a gay man who understood what Milligan was trying to convey in that film. Retromenia (Fred Olen Ray's company) already released THE BODY BENEATH and GURU THE MAD MONK as stand-alone DVDs a few years ago (they fell into a semi-legal Public Domain), so if you must watch them, search for those DVDs and stay away from this abomination. I have the feeling that once Ray reads my review here, I will get a letter from his lawyer demanding that I take this review down since he has done it before on my website. The truth is, he produces inferior DVDs and this one is one of his worst. I have nothing against Ray and think he can be a good director when he isn't making softcore adult films for pay cable under the name ""Nicholas Medina"", but his DVD company has had its share of legal problems.",1437782400,7,2718,4.548979591836734

8695624,5,B00RNTYK20,"If you are an Andy Milligan fan, and this is not in your collection, you did something wrong! This set is amazing! Bonus features! Three films on one disc that are all absolute classics! Definitely put together by a fan for fans! Not for the feint of heart, or those who pride themselves in watching only ""good"" cinema!

Bonus features include a ""Remembering Andy Milligan"" featurette with Tom Vozza; original trailers for all three films; commentary tracks on Body Beneath and Ghastly Ones; and a Media Gallery.",1432252800,5,512,4.885057471264368
8695625,1,B00RNTYK20,"Inept garbage on every level. Now, I'm a fan of ""grindhouse"" films and I LOVE movies like Blood Feast and The Corpse Grinders. So what's the difference between those and the outright trash that this hack Milligan made? Both BF and CG are cheap, cheesy Horror movies but they also have decent photography, know how to use a tripod and have good sound work. They're good examples of low budget exploitation filmmaking. This Andy Milligan Triple bill is terrible in every way imaginable. It was a teeth grinding chore to sit through this garbage. Don't waste a cent on this DVD. I will never watch another ""film"" by this hack again as life is too short. Andy Milligan makes Ed Wood look like Orson Welles!",1429574400,5,702,4.624
8695626,5,B00RNTYK20,I love Andy Milligan and if you love B-movies you will not regret this purchase. Ed Wood only late 1960s 42nd street grindhouse. Nobody's a professional but they all try real hard. His themes are Shakespearean in scope despite his low (zero) budget. Just buy it and make your friends watch it ever time they come over and they'll either leave you alone after a bit or also become diehard fans. Do it! Buy it!,1427673600,3,408,4.453333333333333
