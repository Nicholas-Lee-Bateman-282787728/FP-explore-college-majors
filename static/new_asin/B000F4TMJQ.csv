8117503,3,B000F4TMJQ,"As a kid, I was a big fan of this series.  As an adult, I've caught episodes on late-night cable, and felt that some of them held up pretty well over time.  That said, I'm not overly fond of the episodes chosen for this DVD.  Seems like each one's about a squad member who wants to challenge the leader's authority.  Not what I was looking for.  Good see Cage, Littlejohn and Kirby, though.",1319932800,,390,4.287671232876712
8117504,5,B000F4TMJQ,"I loved this show as did my father and it was staple viewing for us every Friday night (during the 60s) without fail!
Fantastic realism,great stories, and action,Kirby was my favorite as well as Sgt. Saunders,it was always terrific to discuss the episodes with my school mates on Monday at school.
The list of guest stars is now legendary and surely this show was the grandfather of BAND OF BROTHERS and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.
I will certainly be buying more of the COMBAT dvds,10/10 and I would give higher marks if possible!
ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1264550400,5,559,5.021505376344086
8117505,5,B000F4TMJQ,"Many programs of the era had their own introductory music and this program was no exception; the music was by Leonard Rosseman.

They always start out with ""staring Rick Jason and Vic Morrow."" Instead of great sweeping epics this program focuses on a single squad with their trials and tribulation with confronting the Germans in WWII. Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.

In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs. I wonderer what the locals thought of the episode?

This would be a good series to own. Not just for the nostalgia, but the personal conflicts portrait in the program are still with us today.",1251849600,,803,4.640845070422535
8117506,5,B000F4TMJQ,"The Squad was the heart and soul of the COMBAT ! Series and this DVD captures all the great important happenings...Saunders making tough decisions...Cage caring about the helpless, Kirby the best soldier in the Squad , Little John & Nelson a Father and Son relationship...a great DVD for the price...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!!!!!",1231891200,6,330,5.365384615384615
8117507,5,B000F4TMJQ,"Re the other review, it is Sgt Chip Saunders and not Sgt Vince Saunders.",1148083200,,72,4.214285714285714
