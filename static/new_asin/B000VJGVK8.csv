8219053,5,B000VJGVK8,"I recently received this wonderful collection as an early Birthday gift from my  brother.  I've already ""DUG IN"" and started watching some of the movies!  Gotta be totally honest though... I already own the other Three 250 Packs (MYSTERY, HORROR, AND WESTERNS)  I AM TOTALLY SATISFIED WITH ALL FOUR OF THEM.  Entertaining, Hokey, Brilliant, Classic, Historical, Curious,  ALL Describe this and the other collections.  What they cost you will make it worthwhile or not.  The quality and ""STAR"" ratings will also vary!  What makes All of these worthwhile is the fact that out of  2 5 0  M o v i e s....  There has got to be something that ANYONE would like.  Did I mention that you also have 250 Movies in a BLACK CUBE that is about 5.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 Inches Approximately.  Hmmmm  now as to Price.  That varies now as they are not made anymore.  I believe they originally sold for $99.99 or ?  Now the price range is Giant.  What it is worth is hard to determine as it is mostly what you can afford to pay.
If I had MIKE JORDAN's $ then it doesn't matter.  I would say that a good price should be about $20. to perhaps  $60.  BUY  IT,  IT'S  G R E A T!",1524787200,,1148,4.227906976744186

8219055,5,B000VJGVK8,"Another great product from Mill Creek! 250 classic family movies for $50.00 combining almost all their family multi-movie packs together in one giant movie pack. Now that's what I call a bargain! And if you've worked out the math, that's about the price of a cheap cup of coffee or cheap piece of candy. And with this movie collection you get lots of family favorite stars like, Shirley Temple, Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, etc. Just about every family friendly movie is in here, historical movies, even movies with an all African American cast. Once again these movies go all the way back to the silent era but this time seem to stop about 1960's or so. And just like with the other 250 packs of movies, this is from our parents and grandparents time so the quality isn't always up to today's standards. But if you can ignore that, and believe me I can ignore even really bad playability of movies, then you'll enjoy hours of family friendly nostalgic fun that even your kids might enjoy. These are the kind of films you can watch with even the parents and grandparents in the room. I bought this movie for the religious epics, of which their are a few, and for Our Gang and Three Stooges, which their is plenty of here. So, once again, happy viewing to all the family who will watch this!",1353715200,,1313,4.5210084033613445
8219056,5,B000VJGVK8,"Mill Creek has hit a home run with their 250 Movie Packs (Horror, Mystery, and Western 250 Movie Packs are also available). This is a great way to build your movie library without breaking the bank. Without going into detail on each movie, the transfers are generally good. They are grainy at times,especially if played on standard DVD players. An upconverting DVD player with HDMI cable sharpens the picture. These are public domain films at 20 - 40 cents each (depending on what you paid for the set), so you can't expect pristine remasters for that price.

The movies run an average of about 70 minutes each and are standard fare for their time. The plots are rather straight forward and special effects are nill. They make an excellent evening of family entertainment and as a retro movie night. There are many hidden gems that make this movie pack well worth the purchase price, especially if you can get it for under $100.

I highly recommend this set and give it 5 Stars for excellent value and a fun, family-friendly movie night. ENJOY!",1309824000,,1044,4.699453551912568
