8649752,4,B00JCE6BN0,"Like many folks I was well aware of the NEW YORKER magazine but not aware of its history. This documentary  produced in 2001 but just being released now on DVD by First Run Features  filled me in and presents a brief (the film is just 47 minutes) profile of the magazines founder and first Editor, Harold Ross. Director Adam Van Doren includes new interviewers with well-known authors who contributed to the magazine (Brenden Gill, Roz Chast and Roy Blount Jr., as well as earlier interviews with those who are no longer with us (Al Hirschfeld, Charles Schultz). There is footage from silent home movies of Ross but none with his voice.

One thing the New Yorker is known for is the inclusion of clever cartoons and Van Doren includes quite a few of those in the images. The film is in the older standard 4:3 aspect , so those with flat screen TVs should expect black bars on both sides of the image. For the soundtrack, Van Doren uses lots of 1920s and 1930s jazz recordings (the New Yorker was founded in 1925) which add a jazz age touch. The narrator is actor Stanley Tucci.

Besides some trailers for other FRF films (including a new one on the publisher of Esquire Magazine, which won't be on home video for a while), there are no special features, not even a text bio of the Director.

So, if you are a New York subscriber, or interested in the writings of Thurber, Updike and others in the New Yorkers stable of legendary writers, I think youll enjoy this all-too-brief film.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
