8518628,4,B007K4X182,"This is four programs and an additional pu-pu platter of vignettes on indigenous people in Canada.  We call their counterparts in the US ""Native Americans,"" but I never heard them call themselves ""Native Canadians"" in this work.
In some ways, these programs aren't as militant as they could have been.  The indigenous narrator starts each episode with ""This program is meant to introduce my people to your people.""  I don't understand why a non-Aboriginal audience is assumed.  What about the Aboringinals who wanted to watch this to learn about their heritage?  The narrator emphasizes, ""This is not a guilt trip!""  However, that makes it harder to speak about atrocities like treaties being broken and Aboriginal children starving to death in Eurocentric schools.  Further, this is called 8th Fire under a legend that all groups will one day come together in correcting harms to the Aboriginal community.
Many things here are common to Native Americans in the US.  They were forced into oppressive schools.  They are fighting to keep Native languages alive.  They have struggles with drugs and suicide.  However, it's stressed there that Aboriginals were never conquered by settlers and I think it could be argued that they were in the US.  You see lots of feathers here, like in the style of Native Americans from the US Plains.  However, almost EVERYONE has short hair here.  The idea that indigenous people wear their hair long seems not to exist up there.
There seemed like an equal number of male and female interviewees.  I don't think the US has an equivalent to ""Metis,"" a popular term in Canada.  I don't think we differentiate as much between those who are entirely Native and those who are partially Native.  This may be because Native Americans are usually highly miscegenated.  Some may say this did not focus enough on the Inuits in that country.  In the US, it's Latinos that are majorly changing the demographics of the nation, not Native Americans.  However, this program said Aboriginals in Canada are really growing in number.
If I can admit it, I thought the people that were interviewed were incredibly physically attractive.  I hope I can say that without sounding fetishy.",1374364800,,2197,4.980769230769231
