8187525,4,B000OYCKO6,"YuGiOh: Season 2 takes place in the Battle City Duel Monsters Championship Tournament! The storyline is about a great ancient Egyptian evil approaching Battle City & threatens to utilize the power of the Egyptian Gods to devastate the world with an oppressive power known as the Shadow Games. The destiny of the Pharaoh & his friends are at stake if the power of the Egyptian Gods reigns over Battle City & the remainder of the world. The plot is epic & fast paced with enormous amounts of action & adventure. The viewer would have to review the game mechanics of Duel Monsters just to keep up to date with the storyline & the pace of the plot. The dialogue between characters is very good in emphasizing the fears, dangers, panics, & urgencies towards the great evil where it strikes unexpectedly. Characters still maintain a calm & relaxed demeanour but cannot hide their worries about this new ancient threat capable of endangering mankind.
The voice acting is excellent & the personalities of the characters are portrayed effectively. Emotions, feelings, & thoughts are not hidden & the tone of speech is not erratic.
I would recommend this anime series to all anime fans, but due to editing practices by 4Kids Entertainment this is only optional.
Thank you.",1287100800,2,1262,4.874418604651162

8187530,4,B000OYCKO6,"I'm glad that this boxset is finally out. It's been over three years since the first.

Anyway, this boxset is the successor to the first season. Yu-gi-oh! is a very complicated and intimate series. It does have a good story line and well-thought out characters.

But there are problems.

Yu-gi-oh, season 2 sees the MOST talking than any other season. Some of it is important story talking (which there is a lot of in Season 4), but most is simply 'What a great move!"", ""You're finished,"" and ""I've never seen that card before!"". Also, Yu-gi-oh has little to no character development, but the younger audiences don't much care for that.

Overall, Season 2 gets four stars out of five, as it is a great and important season, though contains no character development and a ton of back-talk.",1205020800,,788,4.7299270072992705
8187531,5,B000OYCKO6,"Okay, who the heck thinks that this season's much better than the first!!?
I Do. We'll don't get me wrong, the first season was okay, except they were like battling out like pokemon, and they didn't play by the right rules!! Why in the hailibut did they battle it out like pokemon!? When i saw the 2nd season it was amazing they played by the right rules and the battle damage was greater than i expected!! My favorite season was Season 5!! In episode 53-Steppin' out, i thought when tea was dancing i thnk her green tank top and dress was beatiful and pretty!! What did you guys think!? Oh, Yeah. I hope 4kids comes with the complete 3rd and 4th seasons of Yu-Gi-Oh! And if anybody knows if they are going to realese the 3rd season just add a comment understand! (Note: The 3rd season will have Virtual World and Battle City! They didn't have virtual world the 1st time because 4kids got tired of making 16 or 11 volumes so that's why they skipped in the first time) So bye for now! And Come on 4kids release the 3rd season of it!!",1204588800,9,1032,4.324742268041237
