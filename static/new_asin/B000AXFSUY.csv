8080078,5,B000AXFSUY,"This comes in Part 1 and Part 2. I got 3 copies of part 2, and none of part 1. I can't find a copy of part 1. Be careful when ordering part 1 on Amazon, the box says part 1, but the video inside is part 2. Having said that, great training information from Lin and Larry Pardey. They are nice people, great sailors, and good teachers. I am glad they have taken the time to made these videos before they retire. I guess it happens to us all, but it is sad seeing Lin and Larry toss out the anchor. Anyway, all their videos are informative, enjoyable, and valuable information for sailing offshore.",1442016000,,595,4.182608695652174
8080079,5,B000AXFSUY,this was a great video by very experianced sailors they have many great ideas of how to save space protect equipment what tools you need how to outfit boat properly,1428192000,,164,4.5
8080080,5,B000AXFSUY,Every sailor should see this. Very practical.,1411603200,,45,5.571428571428571
8080081,5,B000AXFSUY,Lin & Larry Pardey are my role models for professional sailors when it comes to cruising. Their advice is simply and easy to apply in all phases of an offshore cruising project. I have watched this video many times and always enjoy their lessons learned through many months of cruising around the oceans.,1402099200,,304,4.754716981132075
8080082,4,B000AXFSUY,"Well, yes, this is a simple home-made production but they do give some very practical and good advice including the beauty and realities of cruising. They do not take you on a romantic voyage with dancing natives under palm trees but they show you how you can make it there for yourself. A worthy DVD for ones collection as you'll want to watch it more than once to take in all the advice which is shown in detail on their own boat and advice of what you can expect at different ports around the world as far as people and supplies go...like how to refill your propane tank when there is no pressure fitting and other such things as you might not have considered. I learned a lot from watching it.",1254268800,2,697,4.32824427480916
8080083,3,B000AXFSUY,"I bought storm tactics, cross oceans, and Get Ready to cruise,  Some of the stuff was interesting, but I was looking for more sailing tips and more actual sailing footage of technique, with shipping I paid $100 for all 3 DVD's really feel it was not worth the money.",1186185600,,266,4.428571428571429
8080084,3,B000AXFSUY,Good for technical operations of a small boat on the deep blue.  Not a film for entertainment per'se.  Great for the avid landlubber.,1167782400,,133,4.739130434782608
8080085,3,B000AXFSUY,I wanted more practical sailing and hints shown when they were on the way,1163116800,2,73,4.285714285714286
8080086,4,B000AXFSUY,"It's obvious the Pardeys are not actors, but then I wouldn't want to take much advice about crossing oceans from actors would you?  It's also obvious they made these programs on a budget. But did I enjoy them? Yup. I learned a lot of new ideas from and felt like I was sitting on board their boat seeing things through their eyes.  I'd like to meet these two folks but this is probably the closest I'll ccome. Some of what I learned- some good ideas for setting up ground tackle, great stuff on their instant spinnaker pole arrangement, good stuff about storing gear well.

This wasn't a guide for going cruising though, so I docked it one star - on the other hand, combined with their great books, it works pretty darned well.",1131926400,2,727,4.451127819548872
