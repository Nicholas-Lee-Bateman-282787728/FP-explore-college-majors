2645310,5,B000HWZ4MA,"Luckily, I often search for Season 2 to be released, and I was extremely relieved to see it is FINALLY here.  Season 1 was a great set up, but Season 2 is much more thought provoking.  Exactly how God should be portrayed--does not interfere, respects free will and guides us into seeing how any 1 thing we do or don't do has a ripple effect in life.  I love that Joan doesn't follow blindly but really gets it that God will continue to ""tap"" and that his vision is so much larger than ours. Another great insight is that we may never know what effect we may have had on someone or some situation.  It really is a shame Season 3 never became a reality, but it could have become a little weird.  Evidently, this is as far as it was supposed to go with God's blessing.",1161216000,11,765,4.1768707482993195
2645311,5,B000HWZ4MA,"I was very upset when they cancelled this show, just like some of the other commenters. I am not a religious person at all, actually a border line athiest, but I still loved this show. Probably because it didn't try to center on one religion, and didn't try to say one persons beliefs are better than others, it was more about people...

Shame on CBS... Shame on them...",1160352000,16,370,4.4411764705882355
2645312,5,B000HWZ4MA,"It was nearly criminal when CBS cancelled this fine show.  I'm definitely not a fan of ""preachy"" religious shows, but this is a most wonderful Non-religious show about God, and an often confused teen trying to negotiate her special connection with the Deity.  The cast of top-notch actors was unrivaled, and Friday nights have become a wasteland of drivel without it.

My g/f will be ecstatic about getting this for Xmas, and it was far too long a wait for this 2nd season release.  Shame on the Network ""geniuses"" and the garbage they foist upon us.",1160352000,21,550,4.697916666666667
2645313,5,B000HWZ4MA,"Our whole family is still in morning that this show has gone off. The acting ,the writing, the direction was award winning and rightly so. Anyway its interesting to see that CBS substituted Ghost Whisperer (poor writing ,sophmoric acting ,moronic stories but nice big breasts and so far its been successful... oh well as the Hindu's say evil is ignorance.",1160179200,7,355,4.933333333333334
2645314,5,B000HWZ4MA,"There was NO excuse for them to cancel this show! They cancelled it just as Satan was about to enter the 3rd Season and stir up some trouble. Now I'll forever be curious as to what would have happened.

I loved how the show applied how events happen in life for a reason and have a special role.  It was brilliant.  I wish they would have given it another year.",1159488000,5,361,4.128571428571429
2645315,5,B000HWZ4MA,"I also was disappointed that the show was cancelled and was always on the outlook for a restart. Plus, I thought it was crazy that they did not finish the season! Either way, I am looking forward to Season Two as soon as possible and hopefully if enough people become interested, there is a slight chance they may bring back the show.

Granted, that is doubtful because of the fact that a few of the characters are now cast in other shows.

Buy the set! It's worth it!",1158624000,2,468,4.306818181818182
2645316,5,B000HWZ4MA,"I couldn't believe that CBS cancelled this wonderful show after only 2 seasons! It received a lot of attention and even won awards during its first season, but for whatever reason, was dismissed in its second season. The season/series finale had the show poised for a terrific third season, had the show continued, with Joan now battling her foe, a young man possibly working for Satan, just as she was ""working"" for God. What a shame that this gem was instead cancelled. Joan was one of the most realistic portrayals of a teenager on television, aside from the fact that she often talked to God, and Amber Tamblyn, her portrayer, is a stand-out. I also loved the portrayal of Joan's older brother, played by Jason Ritter, as a former high school jock who seemed to have everything going for him until a car accident left him in a wheel chair and all the implications this tragedy had for Joan's entire family. The concept of this show was very clever and although Joan talked to God, it never felt too religious or preachy. It was also extremely well-written and acted. This is a show that people of all ages can enjoy and that families can actually watch together. How rare is that nowadays?",1156464000,126,1193,4.632075471698113
2645317,5,B000HWZ4MA,"I started watching ""Joan"" near the beginning of season 2 and was completely astounded episode after episode.  This show has strong characters with real-life problems, and it discusses God and religion in a neutral, down-to-earth way that didn't offend me at all (and I am easily offended both by extreme right-wing Christianity, and by extreme left-wing secularism).

Joan of Arcadia is one of my favorite TV shows (better than The Simpsons, Jeopardy, Joey (the Friends spin-off, remember?) and Law & Order).

Great even if you haven't seen Season 1.",1156464000,36,550,5.157303370786517

The husband is a police officer; the wife becomes an art teacher: really support one another.

2645526,5,B000HWZ4MA,"While not as spectacular and the first half of season one, Season two is worth watching if you are a fan.  Contains some great episodes, but wanders carelessly into a rather stupid dead with the devil to end this great show.",1435708800,,224,4.463414634146342
2645527,5,B000HWZ4MA,"Oh this TV series was clearly so underrated -- an incomparable creation, with superb cast on all counts, especially Amber Tamblyn.  Not usually my choice of story concepts, I was astounded by the pilot episode the night it first aired, and I was hooked thereafter.  So angry when it was cancelled -- denying us that superbly-foreshadowed 3rd season. It left such an impression and then disappointment that I avoided re-seeing it for 10 years.  Finding the complete season box sets at super prices on Amazon (both received in excellent condition) was the temptation I could not resist.  Each episode was itself a moving and still-surprising tale, exactly as heartfelt on my 2nd viewing at it was the first time.  The series works best, however, if all episodes are seen in sequence.  It was indeed a unique blend of teen & family drama with romance and some humor, all borne upon an amazing fantasy.",1435622400,2,898,4.836601307189542

2645530,5,B000HWZ4MA,Have only finished the first disk. Loved the show when it started.  Great cast. You need the first season for background. I borrowed the first season from a friend and binge-watched. Then I had to get the 2nd season. Since I don't have to return this I'm going to take my time watching it.

2645533,5,B000HWZ4MA,"I need add nothing to the many plaudits about this fine show (which thankfully has no religious overtones) it's all been said here by others, BUT, here's something that should interest most prospective purchasers. SEASON TWO IS IN WIDESCREEN!! - not full screen as listed on almost every vendor site including Amazon. The only one I found that got it right is Movies Unlimited where you'll pay more than double the typical price. I avoided buying Season Two for quite a while. Because Season One was listed by all vendors as widescreen  I couldn't understand why Two was  in full screen which i didn't want. But, eventually, because  I wanted the entire series (what little there is of it - thank you CBS for killing another excellent show) I caved and ordered it. It arrived today and a great and most pleasant surprise greeted me when I fast-forwarded through all the discs to make certain there were no manufacturing glitches (rare but happens occasionally); VOILA!,  J.O.A., Season Two in glorious WIDESCREEN as it should be,  just like Season One.

This would suggest that the writer was concerned that this might GAINSAY this UBIQUITOUS GOD, and not assist the PROPOSITION of this DEITY STREWN SERIES.

It apparently has never gone into re-runs - I've never seen it listed. It isn't necessary to be a Christian (I think) to enjoy the story and the characters, but certainly it talks more directly to Christians than other people, as long as these are not fundamentalist Christians. There is nothing rigid or literal about the writers' take on theology which is very imaginative. I wouldn't be surprised if they had read a lot of C. S. Lewis.

They seem a little crazy to do, but as each task ends, there is a very positive result. Her family thinks she is a little crazy, but she never tells them why she is doing these things.  A modern day Christian story that the whole family will enjoy. Very good acting with some big stars that play the part of her family.  I was really disappointed when it went off the air.

2645633,4,B000HWZ4MA,"I watched the original show when it aired on CBS.  I thought it was an excellent series.  It was poignant in a way that is difficult to find.  I bought both seasons on DVD recently to watch it again.  I just finished watching the last episode of Season 2.  It is the ultimate disappointment that they didn't do a wrap-up episode for the show.  To end in that way... it discredited the premise of the Joan of Arcadia series.  There are many people on the web that are not happy with the way the show was abruptly canceled.  I hope CBS is paying attention. Perhaps some movie company/cable station would do a reunion show or two.  Most of the cast members are actively working in some capacity and this would be a project that would have a lot of fan support.  Wake up and smell the potential revenue Producers and Investors.  Just this once, give the fans what they want.",1381795200,,870,4.375

I was looking forward to the third season, like everyone else, when suddenly the word comes down that it's gone, never to return.  I was curious about the ""new"" characters, one in particular, who seemed to give viewer the impression he could be the devil (Satan).

Is it possible they produced enough episodes of the not-shown third season to record them onto DVD's and let the fans see them, anyway?

2645639,5,B000HWZ4MA,"This two season TV show is one of the most theologically sound (while still challenging and thought-provoking) I've ever seen.  Joan, you GO girl!  If you care genuinely about pondering big issues like the issue of how God interacts with human beings and Creation in furtherance of His plans -- and about how ""the smallest change at the foundation can produce radical differences at the frontier"" (to paraphrase physicist Stanley Gudder) (meaning that the smallest and most innocuous-seeming acts have far reaching ramifications) -- you owe it to yourself and to everyone else to watch, and reflect upon, the wisdom-laden episodes of Joan of Arcadia.

As an aside:  Joan's brother Luke loves chemistry -- indeed, in an early episode of Season One, God induces Joan to quit being an academic slacker and to enroll in AP Chemistry -- and I cannot help but believe that Barbara Hall (creator/writer of Joan of Arcadia) views chemistry (and all of the other awesome science God created as part of our world) the same way Betty Smith's alter-ego protagonist Francie does in 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn':  ""Francie came away from her first chemistry lecture in a glow.  In one hour she had found out that everything was made up of atoms which were in continual motion.  She grasped the idea that nothing was ever lost or destroyed.  Even if something was burned up or left to rot away, it did not disappear from the face of the earth; it changed into something else -- gases, liquids, and powders.  Everything, decided Francie after that first lecture, was vibrant with life and there was no death in chemistry.  She was puzzled as to why learned people didn't adopt chemistry as a religion.""",1367193600,,1684,4.83623693379791

2645665,5,B000HWZ4MA,"When this show first aired, I caught only a few episodes, having been otherwise occupied on the nights it played. I remembered it as being stirring and since I had become a recent devotee of the amazing NBC series Parenthood, another Jason Ritter vehicle, I thought I'd rewatch the entire series of Joan of Arcadia, which comprises just two seasons. (I've been a full-fledged long-time fan of many of the shows the other Parenthood actors were in, including Gilmore Girls, Coach, and Everybody Loves Raymond, so I thought I'd check out Ritter's other work, too.)

To my relief, I found Joan of Arcadia to be one of the most--if not the most--thought-provoking, well-acted, well-thought-through series ever. It touched on so many profound topics, such as life and death, disability and ability, good and evil, and, of course, believing and nonbelieving, and it was done in such a way as to always be entertaining and oftentimes funny.

It is basically about an ordinary teenage girl, Joan, played by Amber Tamblyn, who has recently moved to the fictional town of Arcadia with her family, dad Joe Mantegna, a police chief/detective; mom Mary Steenburgen, who starts out as a secretary at Joan's school and then becomes the art teacher (she also becomes more spiritual throughout the series, which leads to some interesting revelations); older brother Jason Ritter, a paraplegic who used to be a high school jock; and younger brother Michael Welch, who is a math and science prodigy and to whom Joan often comes for possible scientific explanations for her encounters with God. Throughout the series, Joan never fully reveals her connection to God--when she alludes to it, she quickly dismisses it in order to fit in. I think a full revelation was upcoming in season 3, as Joan was about to do battle with the character portraying evil and as her mother's newfound spiritual connection progressed.

Amber Tamblyn is amazing--probably the best young actress of her time (why isn't she in more series or movies?), as are her back-ups, especially Mary Steenburgen. But all the actors portray their characters extremely well and are equally believable. Joan is an average teenager, not one with a special gift, until the God characters approach her to, first, do His work in small ways and then, at the end of season two, to challenge evil.

I can't say enough good stuff about this show. It is a travesty that it didn't survive past two seasons. This is definitely one that was killed off before its time. It deserved a third season, which, with the final episode of season two, was ramping up to be incredible. What a godawful shame that that season never came to fruition. Shame on you, CBS, for cancelling what is one of the most compelling series dealing with one of the most mature subject matters on television.",1362355200,6,2811,4.899159663865547

2645705,5,B000HWZ4MA,"After several years, I finally got around to buying both seasons of Joan of Arcadia though I bought them on Amazon about a month apart.

In season two, we pick up with Joan, the young Maryland teenager who--literally--sees God, just a few months after the end of season one. By now, she's recovered from her bout with Lime Disease and, as we discover, has spent the summer in a camp dealing with the so-called psychological effects of the disease.

More or less season two carries on the same way as the first season. That is, once Joan realizes/accepts again she WASN'T imagining God up. God still appears to Joan through each episode wanting her to do seemingly pointless stuff that ends up having ripple effects for other characters. If you saw season one, you more or less know exactly what to expect from season two.

This season, however, we're given several multi-episode story arcs. The main one being Kevin's old friend who was the drunk driver that caused the wreck that left him paralyzed now suing him and the Girardis. This season we were also introduced to what would have been the show's first real antagonist, Ryan Hunter. Ryan Hunter, like Joan, has been getting visits from God for over a decade since he was a teenager himself. Unlike Joan, Ryan is secretly less than a good person and is implied (heavily) to be the one burning down synagogues and churches in the area. Unfortunately we never get to see how his storyline is resolved as he's only introduced at the end of the second to last episode (clearly the show was expecting to come back for a third season which it sadly didn't get).

All in all, I thought season two was just as great as the first. If you enjoy season one, chances are you will season two as well.",1347926400,3,1742,4.573717948717949

Joan has a crisis of faith, has her faith renewed, and goes through a lot of changes, as adolescents do. Some of those changes were difficult ones, as life's decisions can be for us all. The writers handled this with aplomb, and I applaud them, as well as the fine actors who breathed life into the characters of Arcadia.

We were left with a season 2 cliffhanger, before TPTB decided to call it quits. The first indication of trouble was when CBS dropped the show from May ratings sweeps, airing the last few episodes outside of a ratings period.

Those of us who appreciated Joan of Arcadia really lost out. To this day, fans of the show continue writing episodes on fanfiction sites.",1311811200,3,887,4.566037735849057

2645756,5,B000HWZ4MA,"I repeat, this 22 episode season is better than season one-which was GREAT. A family life drama which incorporates all age levels, comedy, suspense, mystery, romance, well...everything. The middle child of the family has a recurring encounter with God (never tied to any one religion, for those who care). God appears as a human form, in all ages, genders, occupations, and races. It's a pretty generic god but a very moral one. He directs Joan (of Arcadia) to tackle situations, usually simple, but just not her thing. Her comfort zones are tested.
What she discovers, usually sheds some light on a sub plot, an event happening to one or two other members of the family, or friends.

It's delightful, and season two gets into much meatier issues than season one had. That's what makes it better. Otherwise, same great cast. Don't expect all episodes to end sweetly, however.

Actually you could enjoy this set as is, without the first season, but you'll likely want to see both season, so my recommendation is order both. they are worth it. Read the reviews. I found Joan of Arcadia late, thus my reviews are well after first release. But the show is worthy anytime. Since episodes carry over into the next, often, it's nice to see them on DVD instead of TV, so you can go directly into the next. 16 hours (+ tons of fun extras) makes this a financial value. 16 hrs = over 10 full-length movies. Do the math.

Thanks for reading my opinion.",1283990400,,1441,4.665354330708661

I consider Joan of Arcadia to be one of my all-time top ten television shows -- and that dates back to the 1960's.

I am very impressed with the acting skills of the main character, Amber Tamblyn. I am surprised she is not one of the big stars today.

What I really enjoyed about the season 2 DVD was the special feature of a script reading. First time I had ever seen that done. All people involved with a single episode sat around a huge table as the actors read their parts from the script. Occasionally, clips from the actual aired show were shown.

2645859,3,B000HWZ4MA,"Compared to the intriguing, engaging, and entertaining first season, the second season of Joan of Arcadia falls rather flat. In my opinion, there are many reasons why this season wasn't good enough to get the show renewed. For one, much of the tension of the previous season due to Joan's relationship with Adam flew out the window. As so many of us know, good shows have a tendency to fall apart when the two star-crossed lovers get together. I feel that this was one of those cases.
Joan of Arcadia was a good show, and it's too bad that it didn't get renewed. Maybe the writers could have gotten their acts together. There were many flaws with this season, though, from Kevin's awkward relationship with an old flame, to the drama with Joan's friend Judith, to the teen angst-filled mini saga surrounding the question of whether or not Joan and Adam are going to ""Do It"". Sloppy writing and an excruciating guest stint by Annie Potts brought this promising show down, and it's a shame.
All in all, this DVD set is best reserved for the folks who watched the show every week it was on. I don't think that this second season is strong enough to gain the series any new fans should they make an impulse buy or stumble across the series on NetFlix.",1242691200,5,1247,4.522123893805309

But this show immediately captured my attention and has held it (at this writing I have finished the first season and the first two shows of the second).

JOA is a worthy watch on many levels. I would even recommend it as a discussion-starter for small church and non-church groups. The writers did a superb job presenting a side of God not usually seen on TV.

Like Sarah Michelle Gellar in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Amber Tamblyn demonstrated that she is more than talented enough to carry a TV show.  Unfortunately the producers either didn't have confidence in Amber's abilities or themselves, and introduced a completely foreign concept to the show, the experiences of Amber's father working in the local police department, which was not only a major distraction from the theme of the show, but had no place in the show.  It would have been as if Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a show not only about Buffy, but about the experiences of Buffy's mother in her work world.  Had the producers of Joan of Arcadia allowed the show to concentrate on Joan's involvement with God, as she made her way through high school, this would have been an outstanding show that could have lasted many more seasons.

Had sort of forgotten about the series until I saw a rerun of it on SciFi channel.

Was actually better and more thought provoking than I had remembered.
Glad I now have it in my library.
The opening song was a favorite of mine.
What if God Was One of Us?
Indeed, what if God was one of us, just a stranger on a bus.  If we all thought that was a possibility wouldn't we treat those strangers better?
Jesus said: 'For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,  I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'

2645895,5,B000HWZ4MA,"This was another good season of Joan....I don't know why they would discontinue it?  When the entertainment industry attempts to emulate the values of the Christian orthodoxy in such shows as Touched by an Angel and Joan of Arcadia, Pastors like myself scrutinize the doctinal system that it potrays. One must keep in mind that the appearances of God are fictional and do not intend to teach doctrine. Being a Christian of the Baptist persuasion, I think that the story is forced to set good doctrine aside to make a point about our relationship to God. Surely we do not believe that God would just appear to us today, but what better way to illustrate a relationship with God? The story shows how the average person does not understand the Bible much less the catholic system of theology. It is ironic how each of the family members in the story deal with not only religion, but suffering in their lives. Joan marvelously shows how many people honestly react to God with her 'smart' remarks and arguing back-talk. The first season is great and has a person begging for the second season! I am watching closely through doctrinal and entertained eyes, because at the close of this first season, a character representing Satan now appears, and is chiding Joan .... a little spiritual warfare?

2645937,5,B000HWZ4MA,"I LOVE this show!!!  It taught lessons and had an interesting story line.  The characters had human flaws and frailties that made them people that everyone could relate to.  Joan's sassy behavior and conflicted feelings were right on 4 a teenager.  The things she said and did in the show reminded me totally of my daughter, Mandy, when she was a teenager.  As a matter of fact, I often told my hubby that there must have been cameras that recorded Mandy during her teen years and used her banter in the show.
It made me so angry 2 C that it had been cancelled!!!  Why is it that network television execs cancel the shows that R clean and teach a lesson without using unnecessary sexual content and showing of crass, underdressed and exploited characters?  In my opinion, CBS stands 4 ""Content Below Standard"".  I guess CBS had 2 burn Joan of Arcadia--just like Joan of Arc had been destroyed because of her spiritual guidance!!!

2645939,4,B000HWZ4MA,"The second season did not quite live up to the first.  As Amazon's description already tells you, it begins with Joan having decided that God did not talk to her and she tries to ignore his attempts to reach her.  This is an interesting dramatization of the way people really do ignore God in their lives.  But I felt it went on too long.  Also, Adam spends a good deal of time in the first episode trying to convince her that maybe God really has been talking to her, even carrying around books on the subject, and then completely drops it for the rest of the season.  If he really believed this, you'd think it would have come up again.  It is, after all, not something you hear about every day.

I also had a problem with the way the plotline later in the season involving Joan's relationship with Adam was handled.  I feel they missed some serious teachable moments here.

Most episodes in the first season had a pretty predictable formula.  ""God"" asks Joan to do something she doesn't want to do, she does it, we see little miracles and we learn something without being preached to.  Predictable or not, this formula worked and there was no reason to move away from it.

All in all though, this season was still terrific viewing.  The episode with the feral cat was particularly good and it's almost worth buying the whole season just for the one with the zombie musical.  I watched that one twice.",1189728000,4,1403,4.47244094488189

Jason Ritter's acting finally shines in season two and I just adore the introduction of Joan's ""camp crazy"" friend, Judith. And boy wasn't Joan's boyfriend, Adam just a total jerk that season!

Happy, sad, touching and always well-acted. The only show in the history of TV to be nominated for best drama in it's first season. Wonderfully moving.

God, in various guises, is a character. Joan, like Joan of Arc, has conversations with him. God gives Joan a variety of assignments always with cryptic explanations. Sometimes she questions, sometimes she rebels, eventually she always tries to follow what He says, as best she can. The show demonstates the unexpected interconnectedness of actions.

It doesn't offer the pat answers and convenient simplicities which appeal to fundamentalists. God is more complicated. I guess that's what happened to it, a show about Spirit, a show which made people think about religious or spiritual matters in a new and unusual way. Cynics hated it. Materialists didn't care. Fundamentalists were REALLY challenged.

It takes a person with some desire for growth to appreciate this show. JofA resonates with People of Spirit.

I hadn't liked Annie Potts' arc because it didn't make sense until it was over.  I felt betrayed by the writers for the death of Judith, and worst of all I felt like Amber Tamblyn was phoning it in by the end.  Not to only highlight negatives, the Nun Story was marvelous, as was the rest.

The series was well conceived and well executed.  Nobody was phoning it in.  Based on comments in the narrations and newly viewing the series, it's clear that was on a trajectory and season 2 was a building year.

2645972,5,B000HWZ4MA,"""Joan of Arcadia: The Second Season"" is the complete DVD set for the second and final season of this heaven-sent CBS show, featuring 22 episodes of the program.

""Joan of Arcadia"" came to viewers on CBS and slowly became a surprise hit. In the second season, Joan found herself recovering from an experience at ""crazy camp,"" only to find that God has not gone away and is still talking to her. Now, God has more assignments for her, all leading up to her biggest challenge yet --- one that will test her in ways she can barely begin to imagine.

Unfortunately, ""Joan"" began to flounder to some degree in the second season. The program began to rely more on outside-writers of dubious quality and stunt-casting and many felt that the show lost the sparkle it once had. But then the show recovered brilliantly with a compelling ending. Unfortunately, by then, the ratings had dropped off and CBS canceled it in favor of a program whose name I won't even bother mentioning. Either way, I missed this show, and so it was great to experience it once again on DVD.

This DVD includes crew commentary for four episodes of the second season Since it does not say anywhere on the packaging what episodes have commentary (at least, not on the version I got), I will tell you what they are. The episodes are the season premiere ""Only Connect,"" the eighth episode --- ""Friday Night"" and the final two episodes of the season and series --- ""Common Thread"" and ""Something Wicked This Way Comes."" Unlike some DVD commentaries which are boring or lame, these commentaries are insightful, amusing and reveal facts about the show and the episodes you may not have known. Plus, you can still follow along with the events of the episode by turning on close-captioning. In a way, though, it's slightly painful to listen to these commentaries, only because it's obvious they were recorded before anyone was aware that the show that had been canceled. So you hear the crew talk with great enthusiasm about things they're setting up for the next season and feel pity for them in a way because you know that it's been canceled.

""Joan of Arcadia: The Second Season"" includes several other great bonus features on the final disc. You get ""A Look at Season 2,"" featuring the cast and crew discussing the season as a whole. You get a look at the making of the episode ""Queen of the Zombies,"" a rare behind-the-scenes look at all of the major components that went into making the show. There's ""A Tour of Joan's High School,"" a short but revealing feature. Finally, you get ""Common Thread:"" A Table Read, which actually features the cast sitting around a table reading out portions of this episode of the show, cutting to scenes from the finished episode sometimes. This one is especially nice because you actually to get hear a bit of deleted material not seen in the final version.

""Joan of Arcadia: The Second Season"" is a must-have for fans of this well-crafted series. If you already have the first season, you'll complete your collection, plus get access to some wonderful bonus stuff. If you've only just recently discovered ""Joan of Arcadia"" or want to, then you might want to look into the first season before looking at this. But it doesn't really matter where you start, this is a wonderful show to watch.",1168819200,6,3288,4.701388888888889

2645974,5,B000HWZ4MA,"Quite simply the best series ever produced.  This is a TV drama with real characters and universal issues beautifully captured in today's culture.  It is a 33 hour epic drama with every chapter building on the previous.  Every chapter stands on its own, but don't try to pick it up in the middle.  There are lots of threads but the best theme is the way they all come together--it is incredible how everything kept coming together.  JoA is above all the story of an average middle class family.  Admittedly the teenage daughter is the central character, but every family member is developed better than even the lead characters in most TV dramas.  Every character deals with the universal issues in their own way.  Yet the family holds together amid great stress.  I am among those who are very disappointed the series was cancelled after the 2d season, but I am even more incredulous that it was produced at all.  It is not surprising, really, that it was cancelled because the counter-cultural subject matter began controversial and necessarily became ever more so.

It was a great series to watch with our teenagers, as it provided good opportunities to talk about the subjects. The only problem was the programs were so good we did not want to stop watching.

2645990,5,B000HWZ4MA,"Futurama was 5 seasons in when Fox decided to unfairly cancelled. While it was a great run, it did feel like it was a perfect time for them to go without being repetitive or ""not as good as it was"" like what people say about the Simpsons. Something like say, Firefly, on the other hand, was cancelled long before we knew where the show was going and what the story arc would be. Joan of Arcadia was a show that found its niche, was developing steam but was cancelled. It's one of those shows that you start to get comfortable with until out of nowhere it's gone.

Joan Girardi is a normal high school girl: has a nice(if somewhat deadpan) boyfriend, good friend, nice family but then there's the thing that God keeps talking to her making her do stuff. At the end of last season, Joan was sent to what she calls ""crazy camp"" since there was a possibility that talking to God wasn't real but of course he is. The main threads of the season involve a lawsuit, a questionable boss, Joan's other brother's disability and another guy who knows about God but doesn't share the same sense of reverence.

Sometimes it's hard to like shows like this when they're so addicting but then you start to notice inherent flaws that keep popping up. One is that the show does have a formula. Smallville it was a kryptonite freak-of-the-week while cop shows are cases, in this case it's God showing up in different forms, giving Joan a ""mission"", Joan does mission but finds problems, halfway God returns, sometimes with a new face and more advice and end of the episode returns and does a big summary of what Joan learned. While it is fun to find all the different versions of God she sees (mine is probably the weird goth kid with the incredibly anime-inspired hair or the overly-sentimental big guy with a love for poetry and noels), it does get a bit repetitive and a bit too convenient since some people who need help never seem to show up again or even versions of God. Cristy Carlson Romano does one version of God...seriously, and she's in 2 scenes and boom. Did they really need that many Gods?

Now is this one of those preachy religious shows that basically acts like a 43 minute Catholic recruitment method? Not really. The religious angle never seems forced although God's avatars sometimes push it with the ""I'm so great""-type lines. Ultimately though the human interest stories is what's great as every character goes through something and it seems at times natural and realistic although some things seem to be really stretching. Despite appearances in films like The Grudge 2, Amber Tamblyn is easily the star of the show, showing the same cutesy lovable side while also being vulnerable and emotional. Some of the other roles are likable but at times they almost seem interchangeable or just not as compelling.

The cancellation possibly couldn't have come at a worst time. The show introduced the idea that instead of Joan being God's helper, that a new kid is something entirely different, Joan's full purpose is revealed and you're thinking in a giddy tone ""oh boy, now this is gonna be good!""....but then there's nothing. At least Firefly got a resolution with Serenity and Futurama's coming back but we still don't know how this thread would've unfolded. I hope that we at least get some kind of resolution in some way or the show pulls a Family Guy and comes back but I doubt it.

It's always hard purchasing season sets like this since there doesn't seem like a lot of room for repeat viewings. Simpsons, X-Files or Smallville have enough stand-alone episodes so you can watch them out of order and Joan does have it but it's also a bit hard to re-watch. It is a worthwhile show to get into but be warned: there's no end to watch since we never got an end so if you feel frustrated at the lack of an ending, get in line.",1167955200,2,3827,4.572886297376093

If you haven't bought it yet, get season 1 & 2, you won't be disappointed.",1166400000,2,395,4.24
2645992,4,B000HWZ4MA,"Five stars for the program - it was one of the best. Two stars for Amazon's price!  At this writing, They're charging $47.99 - probably because this is a weak seller. I found it elsewhere from an equally reliable web site for $34.91, so I'm ordering it from them.

As far as I can tell, none of the extras in this release will provide a clue as to how the second season cliffhanger might have concluded. When a program with such a huge and diverse audience (CBS admitted it spanned age demographics, which made it difficult to draw the advertising they were looking for) is canceled with  an unfinished story line, you would expect the DVD release to bring it to some sort of conclusion - maybe by a storyboard or writer/producer interviews or something!

If you never saw JOA when it originally aired, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the quality, values and brilliant acting found in both seasons. the show inspired - you can watch this with your teens without concern.

It took a long time to get this out on DVD - at least a year and a half after the last episode. This has probably hurt the sales dramatically - people have moved on since then. Really good programming - the kind your kids can watch and that doesn't offend your sensibilities - is hard to find. This one should have been a long-running series. It seems to me that when you reach a large, broad demographic, you've got a hit, but CBS was looking to target a certain age group - short-term thinking in my book. Too bad for all of us.",1165968000,15,1504,4.434782608695652
2645993,4,B000HWZ4MA,"The music of the ""Joan of Arcadia"" series was always an integral part of the show.  Barbara Hall and James Hayman even stated in one of their commentaries on the season 1 DVD how the music was another character of ""Joan of Arcadia.""  Unfortunately, many of the original songs have been replaced.  I'm still making a list, but here are a few:  ""Try,"" by Nelly Furtado; ""Take Me Away,"" by Avril; ""Shaking The Tree,"" by Peter Gabriel; ""Keep Me In Your Heart,"" by Warren Zevon, performed by Jorge Calderon; ""Kite Song,"" by Patty Griffin; ""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own,"" by U2; ""Wreck Of The Day,"" by Anna Nalick; and even ""Sympathy For The Devil,"" by the Rolling Stones.  I love this show, but I am very disappointed with the production of the season 2 DVD.  It's like marketing ""Grease"" and substituting most of the music just to increase the profit margin.  They purposely delay the release of this DVD, and when they do finally release it, it's totally bastardized.  It is really a shame when illegal copies of a show have better quality than the production version.  I feel cheated!",1165190400,30,1093,4.6217616580310885
2645994,5,B000HWZ4MA,"Sixteen-year-old Joan Girardi thinks she's cracking up when God begins speaking to her. In the form of a cute teenage boy on the street, of an elderly woman volunteering at her school, or of someone on television, Joan keeps getting messages from God, telling her what she needs to do.

It's about the last thing Joan needs. She's just moved to Arcadia, where her dad Will is the new police chief, and she and her geeky younger brother Luke have to get used to a new school. Meanwhile, Joan's older brother Kevin has his own struggles since becoming a paraplegic in a car wreck just after high school graduation -- struggles which have drastically changed the entire family.

More interestingly, Joan's mother Helen also begins to experience dreams and encounters much like her daughter's...unbeknownest to either of them. Geeky Luke falls in love with tough Grace, who is actually softer than she likes to admit; Kevin struggles to find closure regarding the accident; and Joan discovers that just as she has chosen to become God's follower, others may have chosen the alternate path and will fight her til the bitter end.

Although Joan doesn't understand the directions that God gives her, she does her best to obey...even when it causes misunderstandings and sometimes arguments between herself and those around her. Ultimately, she tends to see that whatever God tells her to do ends in a positive change reaction, such as when she befriends a classmate named Adam, whose father is a janitor for the police department, and knows of an impounded handicapped accessible car that could help Kevin put his life back together.

In Season 2, Joan learns to pay closer attention to the people around her -- including her now-boyfriend Adam, whose family fell apart after his mother's suicide three years earlier; and Grace, the rebel only daughter of a rabbi and an alcoholic mother. She also finds out, the hard way, that she cannot save everyone.

This was, quite unexpectedly, one of my all-time favorite television shows. I was so disappointed when it was abruptly taken off the air after only two seasons...",1165104000,6,2110,4.932394366197183
8141908,4,B000HWZ4MA,"5 STARS FOR SHOW, 4 FOR DVD (same comments for this season as for the first) because they had to substitute some of the music in it and the volume could be higher (and have subtitles).  They couldn't clear all the music rights for DVD.  The original music was very cool and especially important in key scenes, not all of which they could clear.  (Most disappointing was they weren't able to get ""La Vie En Rose"" sung by Cyndi Lauper in the scene where Joan and Adam imagine they are in Paris in the episode ""The Gift"" for example.)  However this isn't always a bad thing where the original is overused (like ""Everybody Hurts"" by REM) and skipping the opening sequence and ""One of Us"" to save on royalties is great when you're binge watching.  Amazing series though..funny, charming, deep, moving, with a lot of depth--here's hoping it comes out on Blu-ray someday with the original soundtrack and the substitutions as a bonus.",1523232000,,926,4.656441717791411

I like the high school drama. I like how everyone in the show deals with their life and their faith.

I still hate Kevin.

I still want more Luke. He has more screen time in the second season but I liked him more than most of the secondary cast and wanted more.

I still loved God. Very few movies or television shows make God this cool.

This season ends on a bit of a cliff hanger. I have questions left about the series. Luckily, the hanger was minor and it is possible to feel like the show is complete with only two sentences.",1502064000,,687,4.253846153846154
