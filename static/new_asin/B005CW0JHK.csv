The picture quality of the DVD is good - we have HDTV, so it's crisp and clear, and I'm sure the Blu-Ray will look even better.  It's a nice touch for the holidays, very soothing.",1312934400,2,260,4.098039215686274
4654778,5,B005CW0JHK,"Currently I live in Florida but I grew up in NY. I love this DVD! It brought out so many good memories. I actually find it very relaxing and best of all there is no work involved. I do kinda miss the smell of the fire burning but I can't complain since I don't even have a fireplace in my house lol.
Thanks for the great product!",1312934400,8,329,3.925373134328358

Fireplace DVD is a beautifully done version, and the sound quality is excellent, which really sets the mood. Much better than what's available on my cable network during the holidays. Worth the buy from Amazon, for sure.",1312848000,10,323,4.684210526315789

4654781,5,B005CW0JHK,"Actually this one is really good.  I purchased it to be able to have a nice Christmas mood in my home that lacks a real fireplace and was very much surprised and happy with it.  The fireplace is framed just right, the sound is not obnoxious and you can set the volume on your TV for just the right level.  I had seen a video like this for use on my Netflix and it was not nearly as good.  The idea of a fireplace on your TV sounds silly, but on HD with a large TV, you'll be surprised how nice it is to turn out the lights and let your Christmas tree lights and this fireplace video set the mood.  Just add a classic Johnny Mathis or Elvis Christmas album and it's perfect!",1492128000,,673,3.9925373134328357

4654787,5,B005CW0JHK,"This DVD was my husband's idea, I was a little skeptical initially...  (um, for our TV?)  We live in an apartment, with obviously no fireplace.  Although I have my wooden wick candles (for a tiny bit of that ""ambiance"", lol), both my husband and I truly miss watching and hearing the crackle of a real wood stove or fireplace.  So hubby heard about these types of DVDs and wanted to get one to enjoy through the holidays/winter...  it wasn't expensive, so ok, sure, whatever you want, sweetheart.  :)  WOW... what a neat surprise this DVD is!  It's beautiful for one, and I LOVE the crackles of the fire...  hubby changed it to the music and I promptly had him switch it back so I could hear the crackles!  Then, we were stunned to note that the flame changes (as in, it burns higher, then lower, etc.), you can see the pops,  and you can actually watch the wood burn down.  Huh, that's pretty cool!  Overall, way neater than I thought it would be and I can totally now envision myself curling up in my armchair with my book and enjoying the crackle of my (TV fire) while it rains or snows outside.  It isn't the real thing, but it's a great alternative!  Thank you!",1479772800,,1166,4.383177570093458

My hubby really likes this DVD. I am partial to aquariums so I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aquarium-for-Your-Home-Blu-ray-with-Bonus-Goldfish-and-Mountain-Stream-Editions/dp/0976731088/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aquarium for Your Home Blu-ray with Bonus Goldfish and Mountain Stream Editions</a>&nbsp;several times before I decided to try this one (by the way I like that one too). Once I tried Fireplace for your Home, I must admit that I was impressed. The fire slowly burns down & you have the option of listening to a real crackling fire...or music. I chose listening to fire first & really enjoyed it.  Then I tried the relaxing music option & was surprised that the crackling fire can be heard while the music is playing. I love that I can hear the fire & the music at the same time.

This DVD is so relaxing, I actually feel my body relax as soon as I press play.  The video continuously loops...so all you need to do is let it play & turn it off when you're finished.  Great for playing in the background while entertaining, for a romantic evening or just to relax. I think it could be very calming & relaxing for use in a nursing home or similar situation too.

Near the end of the loop, the company's website is displayed in white text/small font in the lower part of the screen. This seems to turn some people off, but doesn't bother me or my family. I received a product sample for an honest review.

Nicely done! Very relaxing.",1375747200,,1534,5.112

4654811,5,B005CW0JHK,I bought this after recording the Yule Log on TV that kept getting erased when our cable box would need replacing.  I finally caved and just bought a dang DVD.  So glad I did.  Totally worth it.  Huge hit at Christmas parties.,1365120000,,226,4.309523809523809
4654812,5,B005CW0JHK,The DVD is of an actual wood burning fireplace and changes over time. The snap and crackle of the burning wood adds realism.,1363305600,,124,4.434782608695652
4654813,2,B005CW0JHK,We had a lot of fun and enjoyed this video about 6 times. Then out of no where it refuses to run on any Blue Ray machine. I have no idea why. It's not my Blue Ray players.,1362873600,,171,3.526315789473684
4654814,5,B005CW0JHK,"We don't have a fireplace, but we can simulate one by playing this DVD on our TV. The fire blazes and dies just as a real one would do. So realistic, you almost feel the warmth! HA",1362182400,,180,3.891891891891892
4654815,5,B005CW0JHK,The clarity on my 53 inch high def tv is great. I think this is probably one of the better fireplace dvds on Amazon right now. I can't comment on the music aspect as I didn't listen to it.,1361836800,,188,3.8461538461538463

4654842,5,B005CW0JHK,"The sight and sound is extremely real and I actually feel warmer when the dvd is playing.  I do believe the description said 90 minutes long, but it really is only 45 minutes and then repeats.  I was a little disappointed in that.

4654845,5,B005CW0JHK,"It's a 45 minute video of a fire burning in a fireplace.  It's perfect.  The music track is like something out of a 1980's made-for-tv movie, but who cares?  No one actually wants to listen to the music anyway.  It's high def, there is nothing strange at all about the camera angles, zoom levels, size of the fire, or anything else.  It's perfect and it does exactly what you want it to do!  Burn a fire in a loop over and over!  It runs in a loop indefinitely, so you don't have to fiddle with it while entertaining guests.

I'm just glad they finally made a disc that does exactly what you wanted it to do in the first place.",1355443200,,627,4.166666666666667

4654847,4,B005CW0JHK,This is a great DVD to play.  You can have a fire burning in your living room complete with crackling logs and all without the fuss and mess of a real fire.  It makes the room very cozy.  It's so realistic you can almost feel the heat from the flames!!!,1354320000,,253,4.02
4654848,2,B005CW0JHK,"The company website information shows up about 45 minutes in and stays on the screen for about two minutes before starting the loop over again.
In my opinion, it is completely unacceptable that the makers advertise their company website on the DVD. Completely UNACCEPTABLE. It ruins the experience. Shame on the makers of this DVD. I do not recommend this DVD and I suggest you continue looking for another Fireplace DVD.....",1353715200,76,425,5.0

4654850,4,B005CW0JHK,"I only bought this in Blu-ray so I can't compare but it looks nice. A fire in 3-D would be the best. There are two options: with or without music.  Both options have a crackling fire.  I'd like to be able to adjust the treble on the TV to more bass and maybe the crackle alone will not be so penetrating. The crackle is sharp and irritating just to sit and listen to by itself.  It is great if the room is full of people and there is conversation.  That's why I prefer the music background. The crackle sounds normal when heard above the music. There are variations of music and instruments played throughout. Piano and strings, perhaps a cello; soft relaxing or light jazz. I'm glad the music is not a monotonous loop all through. The flame starts out bright white in the center of the fireplace then it does eventually soften and widen out across the screen. The logs in front burn adding some red & charcoal embers. A fireplace screen in front of the TV will add to the realism and cut the brightness for different moods. It is also better if the TV is situated low in the room.  A fire in the room at eye level or high on the wall just doesn't look natural. Something I didn't think much about before buying it. But all in all, I could relax, listen, and watch for a couple of hours. At the end of the loop, the company name shows up on the screen lower right hand corner. I was shocked to look up and see it.  Feels like you are watching a demo in the store.  I don't like it but it only occurs at the end of the loop. Other movies get to display their logo when the movie's over so I guess these guys feel like they can too.",1326585600,5,1630,4.139240506329114

The fire is extremely realistic with fantastic camera work (one constant stable shot).  The nice thing about this is that its not restricted to just one specific event or holiday, enabeling it to be used for various occassions. Would highly recommend this DVD over anything else I have seen in the past and what the cable stations air.

I live in a place where the winters do not warrant an actual fireplace or even a heater so to be able to put in a DVD to recreate the fireplace feel is amazing. In addition, Fireplace DVD is filmed in HD and gives a person the choice to listen to the imitations of a fire or play some background music. All in all I would have to say this is the perfect way to relax after a hard day.",1313020800,2,516,3.9238095238095236
4654867,5,B005CW0JHK,"Amazing, clear picture quality and sound. This has been a favorite for me and the misses and sets just the right mood during the hot summer months. I've made a habit of napping to the sound of the fire and it's great background noise for reading.  As well, something about it gets my better half in just the right, cuddly mood. This was a great purchase all around. I'd recommend it to anyone.",1312934400,2,393,4.383561643835616
4654868,5,B005CW0JHK,"Start the fire without worrying about smoke or flames getting out of control! This is a superb DVD, an excellent ""fireplace experience"" that you can enjoy from ANY room with a DVD player! It's just like being there and the only thing better would be for them to include smell capsules to get the wondrous odors of a burning fireplace into the room!",1312934400,2,348,4.5396825396825395
4654869,5,B005CW0JHK,"I have been a fan of the Fireplace DVD Classic Edition since it came out on regular DVD. When I found out that the blu-ray version had come out, I purchased it right away. The picture on this dvd seems to have more depth than the original and the sound quality is crisper. If you are a fan of the original and you've since upgraded to a blu-ray player, you should consider upgrading this dvd as well.",1312934400,2,400,4.207792207792208
4654870,5,B005CW0JHK,"We bought the DVD, but when the blue ray came out , I was curious to know if it was any different - and it is!
If you have a proper home theatre setup this is the one to get - so crystal clear our little one kept looking at it and asking  - hot ? hot ? Now he doesn't come near the TV when this is playing!
If you must know, we are using the DVD in the bedroom for the our romantic dates.",1312934400,2,388,3.511627906976744

8465943,5,B005CW0JHK,Its a very nice movie of a real log fireplace. I don't have a fireplace in my home. It was fun to have this playing while me and my family were opening presents on Christmas Day.,1519689600,,178,3.9722222222222223
8465944,5,B005CW0JHK,"This has a nice crackle to it, and no mess. Soothing sounds, and the fire isn't too big like another DVD I bought.  I did find this streaming but with the DVD it loops and plays continuously, which was nice when we had a party and didn't have to keep re-starting it. N",1517184000,,268,4.056603773584905

8465947,5,B005CW0JHK,"I've been looking for a good fireplace scene for the last couple of years, not just for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but to read a book by the fire. We cannot have a fire very often in California. I purchased a copy for myself, and have been using it frequently. The crackling sounds and the clarity of the fire is perfect. I feel like I'm sitting in front of the fireplace. I decided to buy two more copies. They make great gifts. I know a friend who wants a copy for his motorhome. Outstanding quality.",1516492800,,503,4.361702127659575
