8664753,4,B00L9S1VY6,"I could easily understand why some people won't like this movie. It isn't scary and the pacing is somewhat slow, but I thought it was a pretty well done little thriller. Just don't go into it expecting a killer doll type movie with lots of violence.",1470441600,,249,4.434782608695652

8664761,4,B00L9S1VY6,"Aside from the most general plotline - a younger married couple moves into a new apartment, the wife gets pregnant with twins, loses one, and forms an attachment to a bizarre doll left by the previous owner - I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie.  But, I do tend to enjoy movies that involve creepy little dolls and curses and things like that, so I gave it a whirl and actually came out pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed and was entertained by it. (However, after going back and reading some other online reviews it appears I'm in the minority so keep that in mind, lol.)

I'm not going to say there weren't some cheesy moments, but I also got the feeling that wasn't entirely unintentional and I thought the overall tone was effectively eerie. The score was really fantastic and ominous and I would probably go as far as to buy a soundtrack CD if one existed.  The acting was...ok. There were some parts where I couldn't tell if a few of the actors were TRYING to play their characters a little unhinged or if it was maybe just my own cultural interpretation, but the main male lead was consistently good and balanced that out a bit. The one thing that struck me as odd is why all the dialogue appeared to be dubbed over.  I don't mean in English (it's subtitled) but rather it's as if after shooting the film everybody went back and re-recorded their exact same dialogue over again; some of it doesn't even match their mouth movements. So that was a little distracting but not necessarily a complaint.

While I can definitely see why somebody might not be so impressed with this movie, I think anyone who goes into it already liking the ""cursed doll"" genre and knowing what they're in for should find it decent to mildly amusing. It's not the goriest thing you'll ever see but like I said, it hits that uncomfortable, ominous tone just right, and I would recommend giving it a chance if you're on the line about it.",1415664000,5,1942,4.490084985835694
