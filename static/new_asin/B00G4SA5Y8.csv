The cover looks more exciting with a different image than the origonal release. The sticker note on the front of the plastic wrap looks great with pictures & the promise of 100 New Photos from the missing camera!(though there seems to be far less) That's exactly what the movie leaves audiences wanting more of. The promise of UV means there's a night that'll never be forgotten. This's a great gift. Do it now!",1490659200,,794,7.833333333333333
