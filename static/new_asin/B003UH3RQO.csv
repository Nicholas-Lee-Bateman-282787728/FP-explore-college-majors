4203709,4,B003UH3RQO,I am a senior who use to do yoga at least 3 or 4 times a week. The last 2 years I have slowly given it up and really did notice the stiffness that was beginning to take over my body. I saw this yoga tape on TV and thought I would try it because the instructor was not 20 years old and seemed to know what she was talking about. She actually caters to people in my age bracket. I have begun again and I must say so far it has been painless. I do feel a difference already and plan to continue as a preventative against arthritis which we all may encounter as we get older.,1293494400,40,571,3.847457627118644
4203710,4,B003UH3RQO,"The instructor was very easy to follow and the moves were not difficult. I wish she had been the only person in the video. Neither the man or the woman doing the movements were very happy to be there. The man appeared to be anorexic - his chest was caved in and when they did the shoulder moves it was almost impossible to watch.
The other woman in the video appeared to only be particapating because there was someone off screen holding her mother hostage. She did not smile once through out the entire instruction.

I agree there should be people to help demonstrate the movemments at different levels, but next time have a couple of people who want to participate.",1293408000,7,667,4.512396694214876
4203711,5,B003UH3RQO,"This presentation is very well done, she certainly knows her material and how to present it. The session is well formatted and easy to follow even if you have not had yoga before. You do not have to have arthritis to follow and reap the benefits, enjoy!",1293321600,12,253,4.404255319148936
4203712,5,B003UH3RQO,"For myself and others in my family this video has been a blessing.
It helps the body and the mind and applies to all
It could be done sitting down at work, standing up waiting for the bus or helped by a chair or a counter doing your cooking
I love it",1292371200,25,250,3.826923076923077
4203713,4,B003UH3RQO,"I first saw Peggy Cappy on PBS during a membership pledge drive. She is an excellent Yoga instructor with a soothing voice that easily prods you into a level of relaxation. Most, but not all, of her instruction is well suited for elderly students with physical limitations. A few of the stretches can be too difficult for someone not flexible or limber although with time and by following a weekly routine the stretches become easier. If you are recovering from any type of injury make sure your doctor or physical therapist gives the green light to begin even the easiest warm-ups associated with Yoga. I spend a lot of time in front of a computer and find the hand warm-ups along with the neck stretches really helps lessen my discomfort. Doing just those moves could benefit anyone of any age and minimize the related pain. Overall this is a great video.",1292284800,85,857,4.682119205298013
4203714,5,B003UH3RQO,I like the different options for working out on this dvd. If I'm extra sore I can sit and work out. When I'm having a good day I vary the stretches by standing. Has helped already with my shoulders and hands.,1292198400,27,208,4.097560975609756
4203715,5,B003UH3RQO,"I found this DVD excellent. The program is clearly explanned step by step. I am 67 yrs old but feel this is good for any age, especially if you are not experienced in Yoga.",1291939200,92,172,4.088235294117647
4203716,5,B003UH3RQO,This yoga cd really helped me with my stiff joints. I feel much better after using this yoga cd. Highly recommend this for people with stiff and painful joints!,1291161600,96,160,4.551724137931035
4203717,5,B003UH3RQO,"I bought this DVD after being told I have mild Spinal Stenosis and need surgery.  I may have to have the surgery someday, but not now.  I do the reclining position stretches every morning.  It has increased my range of motion and comfort.  I had the flu and didn't do them for a few days.  I could tell my range of motion decreased.  It is the first time in my life that I want to do exercises because I feel better afterwards.  I do the gentle warm up and hand exercises at the end of the day.  I am amazed at how well my lower back feels just by rolling my shoulders.  They are great exercises for anyone who sits at a computer.  I haven't done any of the other exercises yet.  It will be awhile before I do the standing or sun salutations.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has lost motion because of arthritis.  I am sure you will feel better with the help of this DVD.  Pat Murphy",1290988800,355,893,4.086705202312139
4203728,5,B003UH3RQO,"I love the relaxing atmosphere of this video. No obnoxious music blaring, but enough solid exercises for me to be sore and satisfied that I got a great workout.",1513555200,,160,4.551724137931035

I'm an ex college football player in my late 50's who's had many surgeries to my knees, shoulders, foot and hands---arthritis galore!  Initially, I thought these exercises were to easy. But don't be mislead. It is a full workout. I do these 3 yo 4 days a week either before I do my 2 to 4 mile walk or my bike ride. And guess what? Do these exercises regularly and You will feel better. I know I do!! Don't sit around and let pain manage your day. YOU..get up off of your rear end and manage your pain!! I recommend this DVD whole heartedly.",1503100800,2,624,4.243697478991597
4203759,5,B003UH3RQO,"I just  finished 24 sessions of PT following a hip replacement due to osteoarthritis.  I needed to find something to replace my PT and just not stop to maintain and even further the progress I'd made. After one of my PT sessions, I came across a PBS program about this DVD. It peaked my interest so I came on here and read reviews. In my opinion, what makes this great is that there are three ways to perform the same positions. Sitting, standing and holding a chair, or standing without any aids. You can even mix them up to what works for you. The warm up is great and I can do the standing positions occasionally holding a chair. I do the exercises a minimum of four times a week.  I feel absolutely great!  My range of motion, balance and gait have improved much quicker than just doing PT exercises. I'm already looking into other DVDs.

Also worth mentioning,  is that my foot was turning in from muscle memory of walking for far too long with a bad hip. I had to think about my gait. These exercises have cured that as well.",1502668800,8,1031,4.316062176165803

4203778,5,B003UH3RQO,This is the only video for rheumatoid arthritis that I have found that really considers some of the limitations RA put on your body versus a typical yoga or pilates video that includes posed that involve putting all your weight onto your hands/wrists.

I can even sit crossed-leg on the floor now!  I love that she shows 3 different ways of doing these movements!  I do the sun salutation every morning to stretch out my joints and ligaments and it really gets my day started with a lot less pain.  Thanks for a great DVD!",1487808000,9,408,4.17948717948718

I've only tried yoga once in my life before this DVD, and thought there was something wrong with me that I just couldn't get into it.  Well, this DVD may be good for the comatose or the terminally ill, but since I am neither--and grateful for that--I found it SLOW AND BORING BEYOND BELIEF.  And the DVD is LONNNNNNNNNNNNNG, TOO.

It's geared toward elderly people (which I am not, but have mobility issues), and if you're completely inactive it's helpful for stretching.  It's more stretching than strength building, at least for me.  The only thing I don't like about it is that, if you did all the sections in a row, it would take you hours to go through it all.  I usually don't have hours, so I have to do some of the stretches on my own and then view a section or so at a time.",1469491200,3,528,4.097087378640777

4203907,4,B003UH3RQO,"This DVD is a very good (from the perspective of a person who knows very little about yoga, namely me) introduction to the world of yoga.  It is geared toward those with some level of handicap due to arthritis and therefore has multiple levels of intensity to accommodate individuals with all levels of ability.  The workout is also divided into segments geared to various body parts ( hands and arms, legs, standing postures etc.) so you can do the entire workout or only those suited to your purposes.  My wife and I found the workout to be surprisingly intense and after doing the entire workout for the first time I found myself sore the next day.  I recommend this video as a good basic introduction to yoga.",1465171200,13,713,4.590551181102362
4203908,5,B003UH3RQO,Way better than the yoga video recommended by my doctor.

4203909,4,B003UH3RQO,"Husband and I are 65 with arthritis. We do this practice together. Sometimes we just do the warm-up, sometimes we add the standing poses or the hand and wrist warm-ups or the sun salutations. I like having the options offered in 7 different sections with 3 levels of difficulty for all poses. We like to mix it up according to how we feel. I always feel better after practicing with this DVD. Some viewers have complained about the instructor talking too much between poses. She's explaining correct form and variations if the pose is too much for you. I don't mind this, I JUST REPEAT THE POSE and get more stretching in while she's talking. It's not excessive chatter.

4203976,5,B003UH3RQO,"This is definitely a learning video; it's not a practice video. By that I mean a lot of time is spent explaining how to do the poses in different ways for different abilities, so once you learn how to do the poses and stretches right, you will most likely become impatient with the slow pace. I love it, though. After I did it with the video a few times to learn the poses and proper posture, etc., I wrote down the sequence and now can do it from my list. I can always refer back to the video or use it when I have more time. But the point of it really is to help you get more flexible and relieve some arthritis pain, and the DVD definitely works toward this end. I may feel some strain that I gently work through during practice, but I am without a doubt faster-moving and more fluid when I'm done. Thank you Peggy Cappy!",1451865600,8,824,4.124223602484472

My knees got so bad I had to go to the doctor.  I had an Xray done on my right knee and found out thatI had a fuild build up in my knees and it was bad.  My doctor gave me an exercise chart for strenghtening my knees but that was too boring. Then one day I saw Peggy Cappy on PBS teaching about the benefits of yoga for arthritis so I ordered the DVD and have been performing yoga 3 or 4 times per week for about 2 months and my knees are almost back to normal.  I am so grateful!  This DVD is worth every dollar I paid for it.  I will most likely buy another more advance yoga DVD from her in the near future.

Yoga was something I thought I couldn't do until seeing promotional video on pbs. Glad I bought it.
My only criticism is some of the camera angles are not the best to see form at a few points in the video. And in my opinion sometimes focuses too long on the others performing positions instead of on Peggy. Again only at a few points. I would still recommend to a friend.

Sadly I fell away from the practice over the years, and now that I NEED Yoga in my life, I find that this one just doesn't fill the need. I would have added a little soothing background music, and more emphasis on the breathing technique, which is such an important part of Yoga practice. Also, I wish the three participants in the video looked happier doing their poses. All in all, it is just too mechanical to suit my taste. The postures do seem to be geared toward people with some range of mobility difficulty, which is what you would expect, so there's nothing in the video that would be harmful.

Some of the hand movements are also counterproductive, such as in pulling the thumb into the palm of the hand as this would not work well with thumb,wrist joint arthritis where those muscles may be atrophying and if anything the external thum muscles need to be strengthened, not the opposite. I also noticed errors, as there are three different individuals doing the moves and at some times the movements of, say, the hands, are not all uniform and the same. Additionally, one of the moves is cut short, moving from the salute to the sun into the triangle pose is simply cut off.",1423008000,5,799,4.673758865248227

great introduction to, and a no yogi ego approach to yoga.
peggy has helped me (because of her video's) to conquer my pain and make yoga a significant part of my life.
if you are in pain, and you have that manly yoga is for girls attitude, like I did, trust me drop the tude, put in this video, and prepare to be transformed into a better person, no matter your age, much less pain, no more pain pills, and a fantastic feeling overall. it really hit me when I bent over to pick up something and I did it smoothly and effortlessly, and didn't even think about the lack of pain, until a moment later when I realized I just did something without pain that has been there since an accident at work years earlier. mind you, you have to get into it, the breathing and the dedication to your practice is of the utmost importance, but just like peggy says, the key to beating pain from arthritis or other causes is movement, your body is meant to move, she will show you great ways to start, thanks peggy, from the bottom of my stronger heart !!",1421280000,7,1172,4.1902654867256635

Having a parent that does not drive and who rarely wants to get out of the house, it can be difficult to convince them to join a group either due to embaressment or because the class moves too fast.

This video provides a nice solution in that it is done in the privacy of the house, when they are up to doing it, and it can be slowed down and replayed if something does not make sense.

This is NOT an advanced or even intermediate program but rather a straight forward introduction to yoga on a fun and friendly basis.

4204243,4,B003UH3RQO,"I've seen Peggy Cappy on several PBS specials, and I support my local PBS station. I got this DVD for the obvious reason that I have arthritis. However...I also have a full-time job, pets and a busy life so I've never been able to take the time to practice the DVD all the way to the end. It's over an hour and a half long and I just don't ever have that kind of time.

I have done the warm-up stretches many times and those alone are very helpful. I'd like to try more of the poses but I'm not sure I'll have time until after I retire! What I've ended up doing is creating my own much shorter practice from what I've learned from the DVD so far. It's only 5-10 mins a day but still helpful.

I agree with other reviewers here that this DVD would be so much better if it were divided into two sections: an instructional part and an actual practice part which goes from stretches to poses, etc., without all the explanations to have to listen to (or fast forward through) every time. The instructional part could be 1 1/2 hours, but the practice, to be practical, shouldn't be longer than 30 mins or so, enabling average busy folks like me to actually do it 3-4 times a week. A bit of background music, even simple nature sounds, would also be a great addition, as it would help to keep outside noises from distracting from the practice, concentration and breathing.

I wish I could devote an hour and a half every day to yoga, but seriously, it just isn't going to happen. So, please, Ms. Cappy, help out those of us who need yoga by creating a practice we'll all have time to do. Namaste.",1399766400,3,1589,4.2724252491694354

4204279,5,B003UH3RQO,"I have purchased many exercise tapes and DVD's over the years, including one or two Yoga presentations.  At last I have found one that works and doesn't drive me nuts with a 20-something yelling for half an hour.  No, the instructor has a very soothing voice, the other two people working with her are totally silent throughout the tape, and there is NO music!  Thank God!  The first day, I was quite frustrated trying to do as she directed and did not finish the work-out.  The second day, I got most of it down due to better concentration, and the third day (today) I got almost all of it by really listening to ""right/left"" commands.

I bought this DVD because I've had a rotten ski season due to pain in my left hip/lower back area.  I move my furniture around a lot, so probably twisted the wrong way at some point.  One day last week, I went skiing even though I was hurting, got up there and found I could not take more than one run because I was in such pain, even having taken an Aleve that morning.  I stretched when I got home, used and ice pack on the hip, and took Aleve again, all to no avail, and I was miserable in bed.  I've been in pain until yesterday when I did most of the Yoga routine on this dvd and was totally amazed and shocked that my pain went away, and I woke up this morning feeling normal.  In fact, I felt good enough to ski, but did not because I wasn't organized enough to go.

Well, I did this routine again tonight, and really feel good.  One other reviewer said they felt great after they did the tape only once, and, really, I thought ""this can't be"", but I found out it really does work if you apply the instructor's directions and are serious about finishing the whole workout.  I now wish I had started Yoga 40 years ago.  I am almost 68, but have always been in good shape for the most part.  I do not like exercise in general, like what you get at gyms (I belong to 3), and I hardly use my 2 pieces of exercise equipment because it is too boring.  But this workout is fabulous.  It is easy and difficult at the same time; there is no sweating or pounding, but somehow it works.  I thought my ski season was over, but now I plan to go at the first opportunity when we get more new snow.  I also plan to look into other dvd's by this wonderful instructor who I found on PBS.  I am so thankful I was able to fix my problem with this yoga workout instead of going to a doctor, followed by more boring therapy.  Try it; you will be amazed if you have the patience to get through the first day.  I am not very flexible, so if I can do this, so can you.",1394064000,,2589,4.113545816733068

She is very pleasant to do yoga with and when I have told friends about it, some have said they may purchase it.  I believe they will be very happy if they do.  I did regular yoga in the 80s with Lilias Folan and am happy that at the age of 77 I can do yoga again.

Yoga is supposed to relax you, but this one just left me agitated.  She talks almost non-stop and it takes forever to do one move.  The DVD is 110 minutes and most of that is her talking and telling you how she is going to do a move instead of doing the actual move.  I'm not adding a dvd to my routine that is one where each time I use it I have to fast forward through parts to get to actual moves instead of all the babbling. They should have included another part on the DVD that was condensed down to just the moves and actual yoga workout.
I bought one for my Mom at the same time and we both felt the same about this dvd, waste of time and money and not one that we could do again.  The only use one might get out of it is to memorize the moves and do the routine yourself, but you could get that same info from a book or online.",1378857600,28,989,3.871287128712871

I had been looking everywhere for a pilates or yoga DVD that would fit my needs and I finally found this one. This video is absolutely wonderful for building strength and flexibility while giving you some time to clear your mind. Each exercise is broken down into 3 different levels of difficulty so that everyone should be able to follow the video. I agree with previous reviewers that sometimes she talks a bit too much so you have to wait until she is finished talking to get back to the exercise. However, if you are new to yoga then the talking is perfectly adequate. I only found it a little tedious after I had gone through the video many times and wanted to move on to just an exercise regime since I already knew the moves.

What I didn't like was the relaxation/meditation phase.  Very important and oh so relaxing....that's how it should be.  I was expecting some type of relaxing new age music, but alas, there was none.  Just Peggy talking in her usual voice...not more quietly or anything 'whispery'.....she just read an inspiration.

The moves are too stationary & some of the modified moves were harder looking than the traditional moves. There were only a couple of moves I found interesting enough to add to my regimen. I'm glad I didn't make a pledge to get this DVD. As it is, I feel like I wasted my money. Find a good stretching book or DVD & get Lee Holden's DVD's on Qigong.

Only limitations she speaks to is ""if you are not strong enough"" do a different way.  No cautions or limits on when you have arthritis in this location do exercise this way or only for limited repetitions.

4204434,5,B003UH3RQO,"One of my biggest complaints about tai chi and yoga DVDs is that frequently the background music is something I don't like and therefore find very distracting. That this video is made w/o a soundtrack is enough for me to give it 5 stars, but there's more.

I love that Ms. Cappy takes the time to show 3 different ways to get the most out of each pose. It gives me a sense of hope that I can start in a chair if I need to and work my way up to the more difficult poses as I gain flexibility.

I simply watched the DVD through the first time, and found myself relaxing. I think that's what I liked the best: if I'd watched it and felt that I couldn't do the exercises, I wouldn't have relaxed. Since my motto for bodywork and exercise is ""Less pain is more gain.""  I thought that the encouragement Ms. Cappy gave to ""start where you are"" was wonderful.

My clients love that I have the time to research and find tools that will help them live healthier lives. I'm pretty picky about what I share with them. For instance, after nearly 20 years practicing as a massage therapist, my ""Top Ten Books"" list still only has 6 books on it. :) The ""Top Ten DVDs"" will definitely include this DVD.",1361491200,10,1186,4.211453744493392

4204477,5,B003UH3RQO,"I liken the exercises and stretches in this dvd for arthritis and body aches/pains to getting a lube job for your car. You just feel better and able to function again after doing the individual segments. Peggy holds onto a chair for support while another demonstrates how the poses/exercises are done sitting in a chair. Still, another does not use a chair. There is something for everyone! I hold onto a chair for support in some of the poses as I have trouble with balance.

I feel a lot better since doing the exercises and poses in Peggy's dvd's and my overall pain has decreased greatly. Anyone and everyone can do this dvd.

This particular dvd is great for those who suffer not only with arthritis, but with fibromyalgia as well as other body aches and pains.",1352851200,22,766,4.583941605839416

I'm sure God whispered ""take care of yourself"", because I also recently started Weight Watchers after being overweight for 20 years. The WW is working, I reached the PT goals for my knee, but I have generalized degenerative arthritis and have been quite sedentary. I know that a 'wholistic' approach is best, and yoga treats the whole body and mind and soul. I practice meditation sporadically, and I'm a Reiki Master.

Her yoga tapes offer excellent instructions on the ""how to"" part and nothing is rushed, no ""let's move on"" while you're still trying to get the basics.  So I was really, really surprised when following the East Yoga for Arthritis.  I thought, ""Finally, an excerise I'll be able to do without hurting my neck.""  Wrong!  My neck hurt for days after doing the exercises. One of the biggest problems with arthritis in the neck is that it doesn't always hurt or pinch immediately; it sneaks up and gets you afterwards.  What the problem was, I don't know.  All I do know is that I wouldn't be able to use the tape I just purchased.  But it will not stop me from utilizing her other tapes.  I just don't understand why the exercise program didn't relate more to the problem of arthritis or how to help the various parts of the body that is so afflicted.

The flow is not seamless as others mention, but there is so much to learn from Peggy. The series for neck and shoulders is relaxing and uses biofeedback techniques to improve sense of shoulder position and posture.  That is very unique for a yoga video. I recommend spending time learning the postures at your level and then just doing your own individual practice to music or in quiet. A goal of yoga is to be able to know your body better, accept where you are, feel a flow of movement and do what your body needs at that time.

I think the problem here is primarily with the editing and design. It would have been helpful to have an instructional section, followed by a practice section which you could turn on to work through. Instruction is mixed up with practice. With all her talking, the DVD is 110 minutes long! I don't have that amount of time, and constantly fast forwarding is really not user friendly. (The last portion of Sun Salutations abruptly cut off, as mentioned by another reviewer.) Her two helpers looked less than thrilled to be on the DVD! Come on - show a little enthusiasm!

It is a little longer than I thought it would be, but it is well worth it. Ms. Peggy Cappy goes step-by-step on the DVD. I think I used/stretched some muscles that I have not used since 8th grade (smile). If you have stiff joints, then this is the DVD you may want to get.

Of course you can also simply do the entire tape from start to finish fast forwarding through the section stops.

My only wish is that there was some tranquil music in the background; would have made it perfect.

If you're worried about it being too challenging OR not being challenging enough, I'd have to say that's not a big concern here.  The poses are shown 3 ways- the normal pose in standing, or a way using a chair to steady yourself if you have balance problems, and yet a third way where you do it in sitting.
