8144140,5,B000I5YSDM,"I have not personally experienced an abortion, although I know women who have suffered greatly from their abortions.  My heart goes out to them, and my prayer is that they will find healing and comfort through Christs mercy.

Since I am passionate about helping women in crisis, it is with great eagerness that I recommend the Beyond Regret DVD.

This video would be appropriate for showing at any kind of retreat, conference, or program for post-abortive women.  It would also be fitting for use at pregnancy resource centers and crisis pregnancy centers.  This DVD speaks directly to those suffering from a past abortion.  However, from watching Beyond Regret, employees and volunteers at crisis pregnancy centers would likely develop a deeper understanding of the pain and sorrow that post-abortive women & men can carry around for years following an abortion.

In the context of a loving and healthy relationship, this DVD may also be a welcome gift for post-abortive individuals  perhaps a friend, co-worker, loved one, or relative would be receptive to this material.  Purchse it, watch it, and decide for yourself.  If you end up not wanting to pass it on to a friend or loved one, Im certain a local pregnancy center would love to take it off your hands!

I personally can get agitated when someone tries to comfort me about something theyve never experienced.  So perhaps my favorite aspect of this DVD is that the only people who do the talking are people who have actually had an abortion, and one man who paid for his girlfriend to have an abortion.

The video is full of beautiful, carefully chosen scripture verses.  It comes with a support guide full of great resources.  It also contains an apology from the man who shares his story  an apology on behalf of all men who have ever coerced a woman to have an abortion.

The women who share their stories in this DVD share their hearts.  They pour out their testimonies and reveal how they suffered greatly  at times subconsciously  from their abortions.  They discuss the behaviors and lies that led them to abortion in the first place, and share how they found healing and comfort through Christs mercy.

At times I was almost in tears watching this video.  The magnitude of Christs love and mercy is extremely apparent in the stories of these individuals!  When we come to Christ and repent, he is so loving and quick to forgive!  And he lovingly provided solace for these women & men in beautiful and surprising ways.",1465689600,,2484,4.80188679245283
8144141,5,B000I5YSDM,This video is a very useful tool in the healing process for anyone struggling from the pain and guilt of a past abortion. The usage of Scripture combined with compelling personal stories renders this one of the better resources for post-abortion healing. There is something or someone in every story that touches each and every post-abortive man and woman. Highly recommend this video to all post-abortion ministries and to anyone looking for that peace and healing that comes only from God.,1251158400,5,491,5.074074074074074
