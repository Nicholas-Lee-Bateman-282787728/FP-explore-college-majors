Many people will not be familiar with the waterproofing membrane used in this video. They might be disappointed that it isn't discussed in more detail.
Watching these videos is like viewing a movie but missing both the beginning and the end of it. It would help to have more defined starting and ending points.
Thinset is available in light and dark colors. The preferred choice often depends on the grout that will be used. This probably should have been noted.

The upside:
This was real world. No scripts, no props, no fluff. This video literally allows the viewer to look over the shoulder of a real pro doing a real project on a real job site. You'll occasionally have to wait for Jason to stop and re-adjust the camera, and sometimes he'll fail to offer quite as much clarity as I'd prefer. That's just the way it is when you're getting personal instruction from a professional craftsman who's dealing with the duel distractions of delivering a quality effort for both his client and his viewer. This was the first video I ordered. I have since ordered several other videos from Jason. I've also corresponded with him regarding a few follow-up questions and his responses were courteous and helpful.

The bottom line:
If you're looking for glossy productions, this ain't it. However, if you want to learn valuable tiling tips from someone who isn't just a part-time contractor on some cable network, these videos should prove to be a bargain. I look forward to ordering additional videos in this series as they become available.",1275782400,,1548,4.837735849056604

If you need something to put you to sleep this is it!  It is an amateur video done by one man.  There isn't a camera person so at times he is working and you can't see what he is doing.  It does not cover grouting.  You can easily go on [...] and see the same type of videos (although not 2 hours), get the same content, for no cost.

I can almost not put into words how dissapointed I was with this DVD.  The product description does not match the content of this DVD at all.  I shop at amazon because the reviews are useful and generally because they sell good products.  This product should be pulled from their website!!!!  There was not a review for this product and i don't typically buy products without a review for a good reason.  I don't like to waste my hard earned money.  Here is my take:

The product description is what convinced me to buy this dvd...""Valuable content was the primary goal for making each how to tile a shower video after seeing alot of incomplete and outdated material on the web. There just isn't much valuable info out there that I have seen. Most of the articles are just tiny tidbits with very little value for the user. Even some of the how to tile a shower video tips are very generic and incomplete....My Ceramic Tile And Grout Tips are used everyday with great results!""

The dvd starts off quite well but in very basic terms.  he discussed how to make measurements and where to start tiling in a shower.  he then began the tiling process on the back wall 4 tiles high.  Great I thought.  Then he did the side wall 4 tiles high.  OK, i get it. then he did the other side of the wall 4 tiles high.  At that point i fell asleep.  i had to rewind to see if i missed anything.  NOPE.  then  he completed all the walls.  let me inform you when he started the second wall there is little to  no narrative after that.  So basically in this dvd, the valuable content is within the first 20-30 minutes.  this is a TWO HOUR DVD!!!!  It was brutal for me to watch the entire thing, but in order to post an accurate opinion, i forced myself to watch him tile the walls in almost complete silence.

He didn't even cover grouting!  all he did was tile the three walls.  The floor wasn't even tiled in this DVD.  He didn't discuss cutting tile on a wet tile cutter as he stated he left that downstairs.  He didn't discuss cutting tile around faucets or doing nooks etc.  It was just a basic flat wall with the regular shower tiles.

He didn't discuss in great detail any of the prepwork. This is strictly tile. I was hoping he would discuss doing mortar beds, applying membranes but no, this is strictly tile, and not a lot of info on that.

There were times in the video when there was silence when some excitement arose...his cell phone went off so you get some of that conversation.  Also the customer came in and they discuss some aspect of the job that didn't have much to do with the DVD.  This is simply a poorly done DVD.

And how does this DVD end?  Well, i though he would go into grouting, but that wouldn't be possible due to the fact there was 3 minutes before it ended.  He tried to be funny and came up close to the camera and said my next cut will be here, and held his hand up, comparing himself to a weatherman in front of a blue screen.  That went on for about a minute.  I was totally disgusted at that point and here I am now writing this opinion.

My advice to this guy is to cut the 1.5 hours of useless video and remake a DVD which includes more than just tile.  The DVD should include how to make mortar beds, install membranes, cutting around faucets or nooks, problem solving, etc.  There is little useful content here.

I am going to have to check with amazon to see if i can get a refund on this.  I work hard for my money and this is the first product i have bought where i feel like i have been taken for a ride!  Look elsewhere for a good quality dvd.",1263081600,,4096,4.188461538461539
