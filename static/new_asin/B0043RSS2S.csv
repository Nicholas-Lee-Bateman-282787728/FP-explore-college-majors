The videos where very informative and the moves she put together were beautiful!  Building a base of sharp first and then building a base of soft moves really made a lot of sense with the last step of transitions and traveling puts everything in perspective and connects it all together.  All dancers should have these 2 videos whether your just beginning or have done your own choreography for a while they will be able to take information from both and apply it to their own dancing!  Leyla has done another wonderful job and I am so glad these videos are now part of my collection!
