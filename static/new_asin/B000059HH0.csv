1407247,5,B000059HH0,"Okay, now it may seem like I'm spoiling this, but I'm not.  First of all, the first episode of this video starts out with Lady Devimon coming, and then there's Piedmon.  So this is a really great start.  And when WarGreymon says he's ready for dying at old age, you may think he's talking gibbersh!  Then the next episode is where Tai is about to die (which is surprising because Digimon always been peaceful, except for monsters).  So this was a surprising episode, but good.  And the last is where they are turned into key chains, and the ending is more thrilling than ever.  So you can't miss it.",1002672000,2,599,4.440366972477064
1407248,3,B000059HH0,"If this is a well dubbed anime, then I'm dead and floating down the golden Nile.  This is not a well dubbed anime.  At all.  It's worse then DBZ.  How can people like the horrid puns/cheesy jokes? And why did the decied not to release the crowning achievment, Machinedramon-sama's two-episode-long ""saga"". (Sama is a japanese title, meaning lord, for all you who didn't know) Also, why are they only releaseing certain episodes, like only Myotismon saga or Piedmon saga. Seems suspicious to me. Well, overall I'd give it three stars. Five for the japanese version, which unfortunatly is not avalible in the USA.  Especally Machinedramon.",993254400,2,637,5.0285714285714285

7933683,5,B000059HH0,"i didn't hate this tape, but i was disapointed that they released these VHS tapes in disorder and not the whole seasons.

***spoiler tidbit(if you haven't seen this yet)***
My favorite episode is ''Piedmons Last Jest'' where the last of the dark masters(the baddest of badguys) starts turning everyone into keychains and T.K. ends up having to fight him alone with his partner Patamon who is unable to beat him after becoming the champion stage Angemon, but T.K. who is unsure he can do it alone ends up activating his crest of hope(which later they learn they don't need the crest to do it) and so Angemon digivoles to his Ultimate form Magnaangemon and they save their friends!

Probably a must for a real hardcore digimon fan(if they have a VCR of course).",1305417600,,759,4.6992481203007515

7933685,4,B000059HH0,Why does everyone call this a rip-off of pokemon. Theyre very different AND Digimon came out first (not in america gut in japan). Anyways i would highly recommend this and it is far more exciting than pokemon in my opinion.,1188777600,,223,4.6
7933686,5,B000059HH0,"I just love Digimon! I so can't wait to get it on video! I highly recommend watching it, if you don't care for pokemon, then you'll like Digimon, it is more adult, and it has a lot more depth.

 This is one of the more funnier story arks, you should really watch it if you haven't already. But if you are going to start watching Digimon you should start with the earlier episodes, because this is one starts at pretty much the end of the first season. So you should really start further back before you watch this one.",1100217600,5,518,4.222222222222222
7933687,5,B000059HH0,"Many people might say that they've outgrown Digimonm and went to Pokemon, but I think they're just wusses that like Misty too much. I thinks its awesome how Taichi-chan and Yamato-kun fight. I'd rather watch 8 annoying people than watch 3 idiotic retards have creatures that can only say their name (save meowth). Sorry but I want my friends to talk to me and not say ""Pika Pika!!!!""",1092182400,3,383,4.647058823529412

Digimon is no different, only thing is, instead of having 3 annoying characters they have 8! If you want entertainment watch Fooly coolly or something!",1088812800,,252,5.023809523809524
7933689,1,B000059HH0,"I bought this tape for my kids(6&11) and they quickly rejected it. They have always been pokemon fans and I don't think that they'll ever stop liking it. I felt like I wasted my money. When I sat down to watch it, I fell asleep on about the third episode, but then again I'm an adult.",1088812800,,284,4.089285714285714
