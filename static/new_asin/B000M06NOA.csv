8165465,3,B000M06NOA,"June, 1942, is rightly remembered for the almost miraculous victory of the U.S. Navy over a larger Japanese invasion fleet at Midway, northwest of Hawaii.  Far less well remembered is the June 1942 Japanese invasion of the Aleutian Islands in the U.S. territory of Alaska.  The invasion precipitated a 15-month Allied campaign to eject the Japanese forces and carry the fight to the Japanese home islands.

U.S. forces had only begun to build up the military infrastructure in Alaska when the Japanese struck at Dutch Harbor and seized the islands of Attu and Kiska.  U.S. and Canadian forces were operating at the extreme reach of supply lines, in some of the worst weather in the world.  Bases had to be built from scratch. The tough operating conditions accounted for as many casualties as the Japanese.  The Army Air Forces, for example, lost dozens of planes flying long missions in the Aleutians, where any serious mechanical trouble or battle damage was a virtual death sentence due to weather and the lack of emergency airfields.  The battle by U.S. and Canadian troops to root the Japanese out of Attu cost hundreds of casualties to cold weather injuries and to Japanese fire.

This DVD, first published in 1993, captures the struggle in period videos and photography with voice-over narration.  At 60 minutes, it is a quick survey on the history of a forgetten chapter of the Second World War, suitable for the viewer with a casual interest and as an introduction for the more serious student of the war.",1190678400,4,1514,4.8828125
