8256899,1,B00150NZHO,"Don't waste your money!  I've been ""into"" nature documentaries for some time, owning the Blue Planet series, Planet Earth series, and many David Attenborough films.  Thinking that this was in the same vein, I purchased this set and was very, very disappointed.  I watched ""Ocean Oasis"" and remembered how upon entering the IMAX theater at the museum, you were always hopeful, and when you left the theater, you were always a little bit disappointed.  The background music is reminiscent of ""Top Gun.""  The quality of the film is terrible.  When I bought it, I was thinking that I would need to get the Blu-Ray version.  Now I know why they don't make a Blu-Ray version...It was that bad.  ""Ocean Beginnings"" or a similar title was even worse.  The 80's music, combined with the first 20 minutes not being about the ocean forced me to turn it off.  I am not going to force myself to watch the rest.  I don't deserve the misery.  If you want something good, get anything narrated by David Attenborough.  Even his old stuff like ""Living Planet"" and ""Attenborough in Paradise.""",1216425600,3,1073,4.735135135135135
8256900,5,B00150NZHO,"I bought Planet Earth when it released and I really loved it so I wanted to check out Mother Earth.  I was amazed that I could get a 10 DVD set of Imax films from Amazon at 1/2 price!  It's the most beautiful film and music of my entire collection.  It has Oceans, Africa, Polar bears in Alaska, Penguins in Antarctica, Australia etc.  I really liked the Lost Worlds where they take you to places that have never been filmed before-ancient cities.  Narrated by Charlton Heston and James Earl Jones. What a great family collection!!  Thank you Amazon for Mother Earth!!",1214870400,3,568,4.574257425742574
