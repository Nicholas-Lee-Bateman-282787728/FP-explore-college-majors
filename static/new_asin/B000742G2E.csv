My son especially likes to watch The Emperor's New Clothes and Swineherd.
We have quite a few of these scholastic videos and this one is one of our most watched.
The stories are longer in length, so I think it's more appropriate for preschoolers rather than toddlers.",1302393600,,335,4.694915254237288
8044533,4,B000742G2E,"Unless you are totally opposed to a little cartoonish bare bottom nudity, I don't understand the negative review.  The Emperor's New Clothes is a totally hilarious rendition of the folktale.

Although the Swineherd story is dated, it is a fascinating story - maybe not for the very young, but the 3-5th graders who viewed this in my media center were completely into watching both of these folk stories.

The version of the Ugly Duckling by Jerry Pinkney is beautiful and I would highly recommend it.  It may not be ""edge of your seat"" storytelling, but it artistically beautiful and poignantly tells the story.

I just don't get the one-star rating posted by another viewer.  I've alerted you to what I feel may have ""gotten their dander up"".  But if you aren't offended by a bare behind in cartoon form you'll find stories to entertain and enlighten you and your kids on this DVD.",1226793600,2,882,4.7254901960784315
8044534,1,B000742G2E,"Most of the Scholastic Video Collection DVDs that I have are really good, though some of them are truly excellent.  The main stories tend to be better than the bonus stories, but a few of the bonus stories are on par with the features.  This DVD has a collection of stories that are even BELOW the standard of the most mediocre bonus stories.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Opt for Pete's a Pizza, Chyrsanthemeum, Harry the Dirty Dog, and Is Your Mama A Llama?",1114905600,20,467,4.395348837209302
