2969026,5,B000WGLADI,"Everyone should see this documentary film.  No matter what your thoughts are on homosexuality, this film will open a place in your heart for those who confront this situation within their families. It is an all-embracing study of how different cultures view homosexuality in America and in their families. I appreciated the overlying message in this film that recognized the unconditional love parents have for their children.  Congratulations to Susan Polis Schutz, Agnes Chu and Bret Granato for a great film.",1198886400,13,511,5.296296296296297
2969027,5,B000WGLADI,"Over the years I have seen many coming out films, dramas, comedies, short films, and documentaries.  Each of these have had one thing in common:  they have told our stories, the stories of gay men and lesbians on their personal journeys.  Susan Schutz had produced a coming out film that breaks out of this mold by telling us the coming out journey of the parents of gay and lesbian children.  Each family in the film has a unique story -- Schutz has included families from all across the nation covering a variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds.  When I first saw this DVD I was totally blown away by the honesty and openness of each family.  I laughed, I cried, I was moved.  This is truly an amazing film.  It should be seen by anyone and everyone.",1196208000,25,756,4.467153284671533

2969062,5,B000WGLADI,"When I saw the advertisement for this documentary I didn't expect much more than your average ""coming out"" documentary where horrible things happen like gay children being disowned and thrown out on the streets.  On the contrary, ""Anyone and Everyone"" is the most accurate, honest and touching film I have ever seen on this subject.  I was awed at the insight these parents had (especially the wonderful Mormon parents)on what homosexuality is all about.  The parents of these sons and daughters chronicle the pain, shame and hurt they experienced when their child told them that they were gay.  But then, out of their love of their gay children, they push aside all the myths and misconceptions and decide to educate themselves and find out the real truth.  It is inspiring how more loving and close these families became...and how the gay children blossomed into wonderful, normal, loving human beings.  Shaming our children for ""what they are"" causes emotional damage which can lead to self-loathing, depression, and self-destructive behavior.  We need to embrace and love our gay children for what they are, otherwise we are causing them great harm.  If you are gay and are ready to come out to your family, this is the PERFECT film to give them.  I wish this documentary would of been around when I came out.",1307577600,3,1313,4.904977375565611
2969063,1,B000WGLADI,"I love this DVD but there must be something wrong with the latest batch of DVDs because the motion is very jerky and nobody else has complained about it (yet?).  I tried playing it on two different computers, my DVD player, and my XBox, so I know it is indeed the DVD.  Amazon replaced it after I explained the problem, but they just sent me another bad DVD.  So it's actually a disk-maker's problem and Amazon doesn't seem to have a way to deal with a situation like this.  I would very much like to share this movie but it's very hard to watch.  If I were the publisher of this DVD, I would be very quick to fix a problem like this.",1255392000,,634,4.121951219512195
2969064,5,B000WGLADI,"As the mom of a gay son, I was thrilled to view this DVD and relate to the stories there. It captured the essence of the experience for families of gay/lesbian loved ones. When my son first came out, I was desperate for good information. This DVD helped me understand there is an army of families sharing my experience.

2969065,5,B000WGLADI,This documentary is so fair and balanced -- unlike the hate-mongers over at Fox.  This will touch your heart and heal your soul.  The entire nation needs to see this film. Same for SO THE BIBLE TELLS ME SO.,1203120000,7,206,4.256410256410256
2969066,5,B000WGLADI,"Eye-opening, riveting, wrenching and inspiring.  An important film, long overdue; it will touch the hearts of all who see it.  A rare opportunity to witness the courage and grace of ""everyday"" families.  This documentary demonstrates in a palpable way why people remain silent and why people speak out.  Astonishing in its breath, depth, honesty and intimacy.",1200700800,6,359,5.357142857142857
2969067,5,B000WGLADI,"I caught this last night. It is a VERY moving film. It's is honest about how different parents deal with their children coming out. I am a mother and someday if my child came out to me I am glad there are films like this out there to help everyone understand how hard it is for the parents and kids. If you are having issues dealing with something like this in your life, pick this film up today.",1200614400,13,396,4.089743589743589

8223274,5,B000WGLADI,"Bought this for a group in my church that hopes to encourage the church as a whole to become truly inclusive. We've reviewed a bunch of films. This documentary is the one we selected for the first event.  The documentary features parents and their adult children talking about their experiences when the child came out as LGBT.

Families are supportive and non-supportive (one kicking their child out).  And the families do come from many different religions, socioeconomic circumstances and nationalities/races.  None of it is in your face - the documentarian does not appear.",1464912000,3,577,5.172043010752688
8223275,5,B000WGLADI,"This DVD will quite possible  change the way you think. If it doesn't , I can't imagine anything else doing so. A great tool in helping us to better understand and appreciate each others differences. Everyone should be required to watch this !!!",1445126400,,245,4.6976744186046515
8223276,5,B000WGLADI,"This is one of the best films that tells the stories of families finding connection after a loved one has come out the closet.  I recommend this over ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" because of the diversity of stories told.  A must watch!",1419379200,,234,4.295454545454546
8223277,4,B000WGLADI,"content is excellent and moving. Pace drags some. Method (back and forth from one parent or another, and then to an adult child), can be confusing.

8223279,5,B000WGLADI,"The diversity of individuals, families, and views in this video is terrific.

8223280,5,B000WGLADI,This video speaks to all races and every family.  This video will irritate some but inform everyone who is willing to open their mind to the dangers of judging others.,1392163200,2,167,4.566666666666666
8223281,5,B000WGLADI,"This documentary hits hard.  A groups of parents discuss in vignettes their responses to having a child come out.  The parents represent several cultures and each culture/religion/social class has interesting and compelling responses. The young adults are interviewed too, so a complete picture, 360, is provided. With each set of parents, there is a moment that tugs deeply on the heart.  I cried many times while watching this film and grew to appreciate my own parents' struggle.  Particularly moving are the Mormon parents, the Catholic parents, and the Asian parents.  The outcomes are not always positive, and some parents go through extraordinary transformations, from rejecting and homophobic to accepting and committed to gay and lesbian rights.  An extraordinary little film that packs a powerful impact.  Highly recommended.",1387670400,3,835,5.52755905511811
8223282,5,B000WGLADI,"I watched this with my 88 year old mother and we both were moved to tears. Inspiring, comforting, informative, honest.",1376697600,3,118,4.95
8223283,5,B000WGLADI,Excellent film about the experiences of parents who are dealing with their religious communities as their children come out to them.,1375660800,,132,5.333333333333333
