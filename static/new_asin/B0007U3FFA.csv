8051791,2,B0007U3FFA,"Larry Crow apparently knows a great deal about Remington, its guns, its history and how to disassemble and assemble a 870 shotgun, rifles, and some 22s. He covers the disassembly and assembly, but it is interspersed with history, discussion of other guns, and future course information among other things. He shows various steps with a gun and a factory cutaway (a helpful thing), but occasionally does not position the gun so you can see the parts he is talking about. There is a camera operator he talks to that should recognize this situation but he doesn't. I have not watched the course through, so I don't know if he covers it completely or not. I find the course very tedious to watch.
  If you will follow the manual that comes with the gun carefully, it should cover what you need to know, at least the basics for a 12 gauge. I bought a 20 gauge, got the 12 gauge manual. There are some differences which I find to be significant (you decide).",1332633600,,952,4.52906976744186
