8106706,4,B000E6GCIY,"""Now You See It"" is a compilation of network TV & cable TV bits largely from the '80s.  Shearer's work is never less than extremely clever and precise.  But, because one of his great talents is very specific impersonation, a lot of the material consists of Shearer taking on now-dated pop cultural personalities.  If you remember them, this disc is a riot.  But, sadly, I'm not sure everyone's in the market for jokes about the '88 Democratic Primaries.  That being said, Harry is funny and versatile, lampooning such personalities as magician David Copperfield, Alan Thicke, Charles Kuralt, Mike Wallace, Ronald Reagan, Casey Kasem, and more.  He is ably abetted by his old pals from Shearer's comedy troupe the Credibility Gap, Michael McKean & David L. Lander (aka Lenny & Squiggy from ""Laverne & Shirley"").  And, in the Saturday Night Live sketches, he is supported by Christopher Guest, Billy Crystal, Pamela Stephenson (""Not the Nine O'Clock News""), & Martin Short.  The bulk of the disc is SNL sketches and the Live HBO Special ""The Magic of Live!""  Very funny stuff, though I wish he had mentioned WHERE some of this material came from.  I thought I had seen most of Harry's stuff, from the Gap days up, including Rob Reiner's unsold pilot ""The TV Set"" that is not included here.  But there were pieces on this title I had never even heard of before!",1369353600,,1358,4.785407725321888
8106707,3,B000E6GCIY,"Let me start this review by stating that I'm a big Shearer fan.  I have been since his SNL days, through Spinal Tap days, and was delighted to discover, 19+ years past, that he was going to be performing character voices for The Simpsons television series.

Originally, I bought this DVD for the stand-out 'Synchronized Swimming' skit.  After searching online for the complete bit, and coming up empty handed, I decided that investing in this DVD would be well worth it, if for nothing more than revisiting Gerald and his brother, Lawrence, readying themselves for the not-yet included Olympics Men's Sychronized Swimming competition.

Shearer is accompanied, and almost upstated by the comic genius of Martin Short (playing the part of Lawrence) and Christopher Guest (as their coach/choreographer).

There were other comic sketches that were entertaining (the ""Minkman Novelties"" comes to mind), but I found the DVD a bit wanting.

If you're looking for Simpson-related material, snippits from Shearer's radio show, or any of the Christopher Guest movie collaborations he starred in (""For Your Consideration"", ""A Mighty Wind"", or the above-mentioned ""This is Spinal Tap""), you will be disappointed, as none of it is included.

But, if you'd like a relatively short (120 minutes) romp through Harry Shearer's 1980s career, you'll enjoy this.",1220227200,,1342,5.30188679245283
8106708,1,B000E6GCIY,"I must agree with everyone who has posted reviews on Netflix, this is a really shoddy product. It's really lame to put out a DVD with 9 old sketches with zero introduction, zero information about who, what, where, when. Damn, Harry, it's really sad to see such a poor quality product being put out there. Fortunately, Christopher Guest and Martin Short are in a few of the sketches and are excellent. If you want to see good comedy on a worthwhile DVD check out Best in Show, This Is Spinal Tap, and A Mighty Wind.",1166486400,2,514,4.421052631578948
8106709,5,B000E6GCIY,"""Harry Shearer: Now You See It"" features a calvacade of sketches satirizing both showbiz, news and politics. ""Men's Synchronized Swimming"" (albeit with a slightly altered soundtrack) and ""Mike Wallace Investigates Minkman Novelties"" alone are worth the price of the DVD. In addition to the SNL material, there are some decent cable specials and sketches, with ""Astounding Innovations"" (featuring Shearer as Richard Nixon hocking infommercial stain remover) and ""The Magic of Live"" (with Shearer sending up Michael Jackson) as stand-outs.",1154304000,6,537,5.810126582278481
8106710,4,B000E6GCIY,"Wow, finally a DVD of Saturday Night Live from the mid-80's from someone other than Eddie Murphy!  I've seen the swimming sequence with Martin Short at least a hundred times.  This alone makes it well worth the price.

Harry Shearer is hilarious in the Sixty Minutes Spoof.  Seems pretty strange/weird that it's being released just went Mike Wallace is retiring.

I'm going to place this on my wish list, and hope that someone buys it for me as part of a wedding gift. I'm getting married in July!",1142726400,9,497,4.6022727272727275
