5773191,4,B00D3XM892,Lighthearted funny movie  Great to watch when you just want to escape a crazy day,1405641600,,81,4.4
5773192,5,B00D3XM892,"What a wonderful lesson learned from this movie. All families have issues, but you stick together and work it out. Also, you can't let past disappointments block your blessings.
Christian is eye candy , should see more of him mainstream. He's great to look at and his acting is on point!
Essence is lovely to look at as well, together they had great chemistry on the screen. It was nice to see Shari Headley back on the screen as well.
As always Glynn Turman and Lynn Whitfield bring experience and credibility to the cast. This makes for a great night of viewing with your favorite girlfriends.
My only issue is the last scene, a bit unbelivable, could have been omitted",1403568000,,671,4.6
5773193,5,B00D3XM892,This is my first review. I watched this movie thinking it was going to be really boring. But it turned out to be amazing. I enjoyed it because it was funny and wasn't over the top. I think it is a must see because I enjoy plays. But if your more into A list movies; I suggest you try something else.,1402099200,,299,3.918032786885246
5773194,5,B00D3XM892,"Shipper sent the movie super-fast!  Really cute movie about being real with people and acceptance of others.

5773195,5,B00D3XM892,Pretending to love someone is not always good people get hurt or feel used. However in some cases it can work in your favor it depends on the individuals.,1401753600,,154,4.344827586206897
5773196,1,B00D3XM892,"I have watched some pretty stupid movies and actually arguably like some pretty stupid movies but this one completely baffled me. I watched this all the way through and it was painful to watch. Like ""The Room"" painful. (If you haven't seen The Room I suggest the riftrax version)
The script and plot line were so empty they kept adding new characters, trying to make jokes and plots to build it up I guess (??? what? so confusing.) but it ended up just making it really messy.  I think the actors seemed okay but the script was so empty they had nowhere to go. Seemed like the writers tried really hard to make this a cute rom com but it was just terrible but so terrible that we couldn't stop watching. Seriously, how did this get four stars on Amazon??",1401667200,,754,4.385714285714286
5773197,5,B00D3XM892,"I love Christian, I think he a incredible actor. It's time for him to launch out into the big Hollywood movies. He is handsome..",1400198400,,128,4.375
5773198,5,B00D3XM892,"This movie is different and I enjoy watching it, and the cast is awesome and the family stick together, and she found love, because he didn't give up on her.",1399766400,,157,4.266666666666667
5773199,4,B00D3XM892,Saw this on television recently and it was okay. Far fetched and predictable but still funny and enjoyable. Worth the watch.,1398729600,,124,4.9523809523809526
5773200,4,B00D3XM892,"There's nothing here that hasn't been done before so if you're looking for originality, you might want to look elsewhere. Boy meets girl, they have a small tiff, but then she realizes that he's the key to helping her with a problem. During that time, they develop real feelings for each other, but she fights those feelings due to a broken past. Something you've seen before, right? But, even if it's a redone plot, I still find movies enjoyable based on how well the characters interact. How much I believe they do (or do not) get along.

The chemistry between Essence Atkins and Christian Keyes is very believable. Goofy. Fun. He does such a wonderful job as Chad that the line between his acting and his personality is sufficiently blurred. This was one of those movies where I wished it had a bigger budget and was delivered on the big screen to reign in another era of feel-good entertainment with loveable black characters. Comedies, romances, etc about black life and love and their wonderful ups and downs.

I agree with another reviewer who said that Susan's attitude was a bit much, and the 180 she did at the end wasn't enough to wash that taste out of my mouth, but I would still recommend it. Good film.",1397174400,,1216,4.599078341013825
5773201,3,B00D3XM892,"I've seen this type of movie before. A woman is single. Her family has a problem with that. She cares too much about what her family thinks. She finds a guy who will pretend to be her man to fool her family into believing they're a couple.

I watched this movie because I like Lynn Whitfield, Glynn Turman and Essence Atkins. I was okay with their characters - Harriet, David and Kelly. Brianna (Shari Headley), Chad (Christian Keyes) and Russell (Chico Benymon) were also likable. I didn't like Susan (Denyce Lawton) or Carlton (Reign Morton).

The competition between the two sisters was bothersome. Even though she acted as if she wasn't insecure, it seemed Susan was jealous of Kelly. Instead of being so concerned about Kelly's relationship, her attention should have been on her fiance.

There was dialogue that suggested that there is something wrong with waiting to have sex. Not a good message to send. There is nothing wrong with waiting. There is a scene where wedding rings on fingers would have been nice;that certainly would have touched my heart.

Relationships issues (couples, father/son, siblings), secrets, betrayal, fear of moving forward, and alcoholism are dealt with in this film. Funny at times. Thought-provoking at times. For the most part, I enjoyed it.

Favorite Scene: David's talk with his daughter, Kelly.
Favorite Line: ""The past doesn't equal the future.""",1396828800,,1388,5.043668122270742

5773208,3,B00D3XM892,Boy meets girl out of his league. They get close because she pays him to be her pretend boyfriend for a weekend of family fun at her sisters wedding engagement announcement. Nothing original but  nicely told. Sometimes that is all you need.,1394323200,,240,4.714285714285714
5773209,5,B00D3XM892,"This was a fun movie, Iseem the acting abilities of all the performers and as usual they were great. On your off day from work, I would recommend this movie for a moment to yourself and maybe friends to watach.",1394236800,,210,4.275

5773225,4,B00D3XM892,"I enjoyed this film. The script was good and the characters mostly behaved in a realistic manner. The direction was good. The problem was that the climax of the film was filmed with bad lighting. The last scene was unbelievable and unnecessary. Other than that the film was very entertaining. Christian was great as always and Essence was adorable as usual. Her character had issues, but she worked through them. I do not think that any couple would wait three years to have sex. Why not wait one year and get married? That makes more sense. Highly recommended for fans of romantic comedies.",1385424000,6,591,4.747572815533981
5773226,5,B00D3XM892,This was so funny! Essence Atkins is great in this! The veteran actors in this movie made it!

5773240,5,B00D3XM892,This Movie was truly very inspiring the way the main woman character Essence Atkins chose to hold her Chasity for three years. At this day in time I too have chosen to now hold out and in the process Christian Keyes character fights for her. Enjoys the real her and gets to know her well and they face ups and downs with added Comedic Hygincs .I truly adore this Movie as well as all the others from the these two Amazing Actors...,1378252800,,431,4.2682926829268295

5773243,5,B00D3XM892,"When we carry bad baggage from our past, it causes us to become 'hard hearted' and no matter how much your FUTURE LOVE calls you over and over, and slaps you in your face, you will stil fight it and turn away from it, run from it and sometimes, lose it for good.

You can't get a new life and a new love carrying baggage from past relationships and live or be happy or survive for a good life.

This is what has happened in this movie and Essence almost lost the love of her life because of all the bad baggage she carries from her past.  IT swallowed her and ate her up.

But a man's true love for her kept fighting for her until he gave up and left.  But a friend saw the misery left in her friend because she lost him took some dramatic steps to keep this lost love alive....and she did.

When Essence realized that she was so wrong and the baggae had over weighed her life, emotions, her heart, and even the ability to live, move, feel, see, understand, realize life, she suffered in silence and cried in silence at her friends for a long while.

But the love of her life' to be' was still in love with her, and her BF took care of that.

But the 3 years.....you'll have to see what the 3 years mean.

A great love story. A MUST SEE, A MUST BUY.  WITH A LOVED ONE IS EVEN BETTER.

GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.",1377648000,,1305,4.05859375
