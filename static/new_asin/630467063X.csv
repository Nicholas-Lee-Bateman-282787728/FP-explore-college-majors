904936,4,630467063X,"This is quite an enjoyable video that explains the history of one of the most important recording labels in Jazz, Blue Note.  From its founding in the 1930's to the late 1990's, this video showcases the founders of the label, to the legendary artists that recorded with the Blue Note label.  Legendary performers include John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Theolonius Monk, Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, just to name a few.
Personal views from the musicians themselves enhance this video and it is captivating to learn how these musicians got together in the studios and collaborated to make some of the best Jazz the world ever heard or will ever hear.
The music is highlighted taking the best of beebop, fusion and avant guarde and is evolved through time.  Blue Note has evolved to Jazz's ever changing sphere of music, but its re-releases of classic recordings still (in my opinion) make it the best of the Jazz labels.
This video is highly recommended to all who enjoy the history of Jazz and want to learn something about the evolution of Jazz in the last 60 years.",970963200,16,1077,4.779569892473118
904937,4,630467063X,"This is an enjoyable film about the life and partnership of Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff of Blue Note records.  Blue Note is my favorite jazz label and their story is heart warming.  They deeply loved jazz  --especially the bluesier stuff and they loved and respected the musicians.  Many Blue Note artists appear in this ninty or so minute film along with  the great music from this label.  The only shortcomming is the lack of  extended performances of some of the artists, but I guess then it would  have been five hours long :-)",941760000,12,533,4.595744680851064

905194,5,630467063X,"...particularly as this film shows tantalizing clips from the '85 event. Great to finally have this classic on dvd. This 1997 documentary covers all the bases - the background and perspective of Blue Note's founder, Alfred Lion, the recording session atmosphere, the enthusiasm and dedication of the musicians, Francis Wolff's photographs, Reid Miles' covers and Rudy Van Gelder's sound. If you own or have seen the Burns series, this film fills in some of the gaps and corrects some of the misconceptions perpetrated by that series' final few episodes, and it does so without all the cloying narration. Director Julian Benedikt does a masterful job of editing and sequencing the various segments to provide an 'improvisational' balance between interviews and performance footage and between coverage of the label's heyday and its contemporary influence. The performance footage for the most part is electrifying, including period clips of Art Blakey, Horace Silver and Thelonious Monk, the aforementioned Town Hall concert of '85 (showcasing Freddie Hubbard's virtuosity), and contemporary performers like Junko Onishi. The best of these is a b&w clip of a Sonny Rollins intro that is just mesmerizing! (The worst, and only hiccup, is a clip of Cassandra Wilson performing a dull ""smooth jazz"" arrangement.) The interviews are in a variety of settings and include Blue Note legends Herbie Hancock, Horace Silver and Gil Melle, studio session players Bob Cranshaw and Tommy Turrentine, and recording executive Michael Cuscuna. Alfred Lion's first wife Lorraine Gordon gets interviewed as she takes reservations at the Village Vanguard. Several of Lion & Wolff's European colleagues and contemporaries offer the overseas perspective on the reception of jazz as high art. The soundtrack mix is well-crafted and indicative of the range of the label's music with selections from artists well known to Blue Note fans like Joe Henderson, Grant Green, Kenny Burrell, Lee Morgan, Jimmy Smith and Grachan Moncur. The film concludes on a poignant note with the now-deceased Andrew Hill signing out a sound studio to practice his art. This film ranks alongside the Monk documentary ""Straight, No Chaser"".",1269216000,4,2193,5.396501457725948
905195,5,630467063X,"As a Jazz aficionado I fully expected to like this video.  What was surprising to me was how much I learned while watching it, not only about Blue Note and Jazz, but about art, culture, and in particular, race in America.

Though released twelve years ago, it contains interviews that today in 2009 would be ""cutting edge"" in terms of their perspective and honesty about the continuing challenges America faces as a nation divided down racial lines.  But it does not get bogged down in race; it speaks enough to be honest, and from there it artfully speaks to many of the greater truths about art, culture, commerce, vision, and genius.

The editing is very well done: story lines, musical cues, archival footage, and interviews are woven together into a coherent whole that moves at just the right pace.  The visuals are also great, it part because part of the Blue Note story is the collaboration between founder Alfred Lion and photographer Francis Wolff.  Wolff's photography gave Blue Note a look that very much informed the looks of the video.

I think this video is a must-see for both Jazz fans and those who wish to gain a better understanding of contemporary America.",1257206400,,1177,4.768472906403941
905196,2,630467063X,"I made the mistake, from looking at the list of participating musicians, of thinking that this album consists of musical performances from the Blue Note collection.  Not!  The musicians are mostly talking [repeat, talking] about the founders of the Blue Note label--fine folks, I'm sure, but not what I was interested in.",1210291200,11,321,5.153846153846154
905197,3,630467063X,"When Julian Benedikt's documentary on the famous Blue Note record label aired as a two-part television special in 1997, it was cause for celebration among jazz fans, albeit tempered with a sense of frustration. The small, independent company, founded by German immigrants Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff in 1939, played a seminal role in the development of jazz from the postwar period through the late 1960s. Lion and Wolff privileged quality over all other considerations, and recorded artists when other labels wouldn't touch them. (Thelonious Monk is a prime example.) Such an enlightened and progressive corporate attitude would be unthinkable in today's bottom-line climate. Blue Note had a sound, a style and a look all its own. The label arguably reached its artistic peak in the late-50s to early 60s with its roster of powerhouse hard bop players as Hank Mobley, Jackie McLean, Art Blakey and dozens of others. If Benedikt had simply focused his camera on the surviving musicians and included generous amounts of archival concert footage, this could have been one of the greatest music documentaries ever. Unfortunately, his film goes off in a number of inexplicable directions that seriously compromise its impact. In a misguided attempt to give the film ""relevance,"" Benedikt accords an inordinate amount of camera time to the likes of Carlos Santana, Taj Mahal, and DJ Smash. Their perspectives, while sincere, lack the kind of insight that the original artists, many of them happily still alive, could have provided. Trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, pianist Horace Silver and bassist Bob Cranshaw are given a fair amount of time to reflect on the creative freedom they experienced as Blue Note artists, but for the most part, Benedikt is content to name check famous musicians like Lee Morgan and Hank Mobley without providing any context. Even more problematic is the matter of concert footage. Benedikt is generally stingy with archival footage of such legends as Dexter Gordon, while indulging in extended performance footage of contemporary musicians Junko Onishi and Cassandra Wilson. Onishi is a nice pianist, but has nothing to do with the classic era. And including Wilson's smooth jazz pabulum is an insult to the innovative spirit the label represents. Moreover, Benedikt's kaleidoscopic, MTV-style of editing, while meant to be hip and cutting-edge, just comes across as annoying. Having said all that, I would still recommend this DVD to jazz fans, if only for its historical significance and the chance to see and hear icons like Herbie Hancock and Hubbard reminisce about an era when jazz was about pushing boundaries and enriching the culture. When Benedikt lets the original musicians speak and play for themselves, his film soars. If only he had left it at that.",1207353600,40,2785,5.204899777282851
905198,4,630467063X,"Hardly a ""story of modern jazz,"" as subtitled, the film is nevertheless  a fascinating remembrance of the most legendary jazz label by some of the musicians who recorded for the ""mom and pop"" operation.  In addition, there's footage of some of the major players--Silver, Coltrane, etc.--that whets the appetite for more.  The inclusion of a current artist like Cassandra Wilson is questionable, since the present-day Blue Note is nothing more than a ""name"" sold to the same huge corporation (EMI) that owns Capitol and other recognizable labels of the past.  Where's Rudy?  Why is there no mention of what inspired Lion and Wolff to start the label in the first place (Sidney Bechet), and where's the guy (Jimmy Smith) who kept the company afloat when it was about to sink?

This one will appeal to collectors of Blue Note albums from the 50's and 60's as well as some younger listeners who have made the discovery of these sessions, their distinctive sound and artwork.  If there's a major disappointment, it's the absence of film footage from an actual recording session, showing the viewer Van Gelder's methods and interactions with musicians.

(Sigh.  This film didn't hold the attention of a non-jazz crowd for 10 minutes, and even some 18-year-old fans of acid jazz thought 30 minutes was enough.  It's a pretty spartan production that will appeal to viewers who recognize artists like J. J. Johnson, Bob Cranshaw and Tommy Turrentine.  And it's a nice tribute to Max Roach, since he's allowed to speak at length.  But to go higher than 4 stars is to forgo any semblance of objectivity.)",1189728000,,1593,4.902985074626866

7875282,4,630467063X,"This documentary was released in 1997 and - in 2008 on - on DVD by EuroArts. This is the first Bluray release of the film (2015). Amazon has a policy of grouping all formats of a film (DVD, Streaming, Bluray) together and showing ALL reviews under ALL formats. So I always recommend that potential buyers sort reviews by ""most recent"" and then look at the ""format"" being reviewed. This is of the 2015 BLURAY release.

You will see 33 other reviews here (at least on the date I'm posting this). You can read the comments by others on the film which was originally a two part film made for German TV by Julien Benedikt. He filmed the interviews during the 1996 jazzopen Festival in Stuttgart.

Yes, it is worth watching - especially if you are aware of artists on the Blue Note label, founded by Alfred Lion (the A&R and producer) and Francis Wolff, the photographer, who documented the sessions with his camera and designed all the album covers for the Lps. (BN started in 1941 and was making 78 rpm records then).

Any document with those who were there is welcome and Benedikt uses some wonderful performance footage captured by German TV. There are few (way too few for most jazz fans) complete performances but that would have made this 91 minute program much longer. Like another reviewer, I have a gripe with the identification on the screen of the interviewees and the performing artists. Even to fairly knowledgeable jazz collectors, some these folks are not recognizable. Yes, they names of shown - for the most part - but not when you first see them. And many interviewees who were interviewed in 1996 are only identified by name and not what they played or why they are included. This more of an ""improvised"" or ""free form"" film - like the jazz it captured. There is a structure of some sort in the chronological nature of the film. The 12 page booklet included in the BD case lists the 14 ""chapters"" and includes a 3  page essay in English, German and French.

Because it is an important document, I'll rank it higher than 3 stars but - because of the frustration in not knowing who is speaking or playing - I can only raise it to 4 stars.

There are no other bonuses on the BD disc.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7875283,5,630467063X,"Blue Note Records has dominated the jazz scene and its development over 70 years since its inception in 1939. It was the personal vision and creation of Alfred Lion supported by the iconic monochrome photography of Francis Wolff, otherwise known as Frank. This documentary takes the viewer from the earliest days to the purchase of the company by Liberty in 1965.

Alfred Lion had been over-whelmed by his Berlin experiences of hearing such music and, escaping from Nazi Germany, he set about furthering his interests and establishing his record label. In this venture he was joined in 1941 by Frank Wolff whose monochrome photography was such an important part of the connection with the public.

Throughout Alfred Lion was interested in achieving remarkable performances and invested heavily in rehearsal time for his musicians who were allowed complete freedom in terms of expression. In all cases there came the moment when things absolutely gelled and the recordings were captured. The music had to schwing as he regularly said. The artists featured were often chosen before they had made their names and this mixture of freedom and an instinctive awareness of important new talent coupled with an instinctive awareness of the precise point at which to record the music was vital to understanding what made this venture so unique and successful.

This care over detail was mirrored in the production side of the business and discs were made with the best quality materials and with utmost care at every stage. The label became synonymous with both musical and production quality. The next important addition was the arrival of Reid Miles who created the cover designs that were distinctive, eye-catching and which caught the exact flavour of each discs contents.

This 91 minute documentary film is an engrossing coverage of the above story and there are countless examples of musicians recounting their experiences of the label as well as copious examples of all aspects of the label ranging from rehearsal and performance sequences and stills photography. The quality of the material mostly drawn from the 1960s, but also dating back to 1939 and forward to 1996, is remarkable. At no time is the listener distracted by technically doubtful material and the consistency of this historically priceless material is equally remarkable.

The 1997 copyrighted original film uses SD archive material throughout which has been digitally remastered at HD 1080/60i  16.9 for visuals and PCM Stereo at 24 bit/48kHz for this 2015 edition, available on Blu-ray and DVD. This review has been written following playback of the Blu-ray option using a moderate 40 inch screen but with high end sonics. Purchasers with different levels of equipment will need to make appropriate allowances and adjustments. Bearing in mind the equipment used for this review the product was simply excellent in playback.

This is a uniquely important documentary film that offers an engrossing insight into a major artistic venture without parallel and spanning nearly 70 years. Jazz enthusiasts should find this of especial interest and worthy of repeat viewing.",1435276800,,3135,5.233067729083666

What is most important about this label was the fact that the company was started by two guys from Europe (Their origins escape me at this time) and if you know anything about jazz you will understand that Europe embraced the music way more then it was embraced here in America.  The video talks about the origins of the owners of the label and runs through some of the greatest jazz musicians that we have ever heard.
