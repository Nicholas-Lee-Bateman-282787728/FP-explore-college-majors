Will keep your interest and is a good mystery. I never liked Mariel Hemingway as an actress, but she was actually good in this movie.",1404777600,,269,3.8035714285714284

7865981,5,630425217X,"Now a part of my personal video library, "" The Crying Child "" is a remarkable film in that it delivers a supenseful story line, well developed characters you'll truly connect with, beautiful scenery, eerie atmosphere and is carried by a cast perfectly suited to their roles.

This is a edge-of-your-seat thriller you'll not forget. Unlike many films, this one doesn't dazzle you with special effects or shock you with profanity, blood and gore. Instead it grips you with constant high suspense, voices in the night and wide range of emotion provoking twists and turns. "" The crying Child "" is a masterfully crafted ghost story that gets you and holds you tight til the very end....and long after.",1273622400,,696,4.848739495798319
7865982,4,630425217X,"I am a Barbara Michaels' fan and have read many of her books, and I'd have to say ""The Crying Child"" is one of my favorite of her works. That being said, this 1996 TV movie, which is supposedly based on her novel, is a loose adaptation, so I'm going to focus on the movie itself and not draw comparisons with the novel.

In the movie, Madeline [Mariel Hemingway] and her husband Ran [George Delhoyo] are a grieving couple, having recently suffered the loss of their child. The pair move to an island off the coast of Maine to convalesce and take up residence in a large old home which has been in Madeline's family for generations. Madeline is extremely depressed but refuses medication, and she finds herself hearing the cries of a child. Her husband thinks she's losing it, but later, Madeline's best friend Jo turns up, and she hears the cries too. Obviously, there's something strange going on in the old house, and a mysterious blind woman who keeps crossing paths with Madeline seems to know something. As the ladies investigate, they uncover some dark secrets from the past and have to try and set things right before it's too late.

The production qualities of the movie are actually quite good [I watched this on LMN HD the other night] and the scenery of the Maine coast is beautiful. The acting by Mariel Hemingway and Finola Hughes [as Jo] is above average, but the male actors' were lackluster in their performances.

The story appealed to me as it's a mix of the supernatural and gothic [though I'd have to say the book was more atmospheric]. I'd recommend this to fans of the genre, but those who loved the book should be aware that this production takes many liberties with the novel. The book is still way better, but this movie is good as a stand-alone production.",1246838400,5,1782,4.59748427672956
