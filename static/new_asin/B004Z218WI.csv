This DVD would make Jillian Michaels proud because the body's gravity is effectively used.  She uses more planks than other pilates workout.  I like how encouraging and friendly her cues are.  She takes her time.  She is the only person in the workout and unfortunately, less modifications are shown. This is not your classic Pilates but another great variety for those ready to take it to the next level or looking for variety.

Warm Up:  Yoga style with emphasis on breathing. Her isometric moves sets the tone for the rest of the workout.

Arms:  She recommends 2-3 lb dumbells that are used in repetitive motions and it's different from a lot of other arm pilates exercises because she trains Olympic divers. You will extend your dumbells out and swing them in different directions.  The most challenging part is the first part when she has you on all fours and then you would use the dumbell for one arm tricep.  No pushups on this workout, but your arms will hurt.

Abdominal:  A ball or pillow is recommended so that it's placed between the knees and being squeezed.  Lots of ab holds or teaser-like position, which emphasizes balance.  No crunches.

Limbs & Planks:  Ball is placed between knees while on all fours and later used for bridge.  The ball makes the workout challenging.  She would then do her plank series which can also be for her ab workout.

Side lying series:  Basic leg lifts and flutters.  Great thigh workout for each side.  She would then ad another plank exercise at the end.

Cool down:  Sit cross legs.  She would also straigten legs and lean toward her knees.  Breathing is also emphasized. Great for someone with good flexiblity.",1308009600,7,1758,4.735099337748345
