8215993,5,B000V02CM8,I find all of The Firms workouts to be great. Cardio and weights are a great combination. Every instructor calls out their moves and once you get adjusted and learn the moves you'll be burning calories in no time at all. The instructors are informative during the workout and encourage you throughout. I have been working out to the Firm for 3 months and have lost 28 lbs. I say yay! Thanks to the Firm exercising has become a pleasure!,1273881600,4,436,4.4625
8215994,5,B000V02CM8,I do believe the FIRM is my favorite thing!  The collection in this BSS is great.  There are so many options and the weights are excellent.  I use these workouts in my routine just as much as my older BSS collections,1216339200,2,216,4.219512195121951
