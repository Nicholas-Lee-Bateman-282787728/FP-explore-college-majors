8251305,5,B0013JE1BG,"Yes. I saw the movie as a newly trained doctor in Madurai, a city in Tamilnadu, South India. I even remember the theatre - Regal Talkies. (It used to double-up as the Victoria Edward Hall Public Library during the day time).
The punch line in the film is ""The more I see this man Jacobowsky, the less I like him"" - uttered very often by Kurt Jurgens.
Jurgens suspects that Danny Kaye is hanky pankying with his beautiful wife.
Near the end, they are cornered by the Nazis Gestapo. Jurgens goes into a shock and is unable to speak. Danny does the talking and explains everything deftly.
Finally they escape.
But Jurgens thinks that they have left behind a secret document.
But Danny produces it from within his neck scarf.
And Jurgens smiles and says, ""The more and more I see this man Jacobowsky, the more I like him"".
That was the last scene.",1309737600,,843,4.48051948051948
8251306,1,B0013JE1BG,"This is one of my all-time favorite films.  I sent it as a gift to a close friend.  This DVD was listed (properly) as non-USA format, an obstacle that any decent DBA manager could bypass.  It was NOT clearly indicated that it was in SPANISH and therefore totally useless even if the foreign security codes were eliminated.  It will be returned ... hopefully for a full refund as it was shipped by an outside agency in Voorhees, NJ, not from Amazon ... another glitch that was not disclosed and caused a significant delay in shipment.

8251307,5,B0013JE1BG,"First, let me state that I am not reviewing this DVD from Spain but one that I bought in Germany, also PAL region 2 format. I find it irritating that one cannot determine whether this DVD was formatted anamorphically for 1.85:1. The one I bought in Germany is properly formatted for wide screen TVs.  The German version (under Jakobowsky und der Oberst) is about 9 Euros for a new disc (through Amazon) and also has the original English sound track. There is a used disc available through Amazon Great Britain for about 16 pounds (much more expensive).I am not sure of its video formatting. Remember, these are region 2 PAL versions. If you have an all region PAL/NTSC DVD player it is well worth it to buy it from Amazon.com in Germany, even though the postage may be more expensive. It may be cheaper than this import from Spain.

Secondly, This is a wonderful comedy about a touchy subject which leaves one with a good feeling. Based on play by Franz Werfel (author of ""The Song of Bernadette""),I think you find the dialogue witty and the message of the film heart warming. It is set during WWII and deals with the two main characters fleeing the Nazi's in France.",1263945600,,1167,4.578947368421052
