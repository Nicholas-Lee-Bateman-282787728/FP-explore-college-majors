8318727,5,B001LMVZS2,"Today is 12/14/2012. I watched the first of the two DVDs last Friday and watched the second on 12/11/12. I am a very serious student of Astrology and would consider myself quite knowledgeable on the subject; I've studied with and am being taught by the best! This DVD was fantastic-Ansara is fascinating. I took lots of notes. I am very honored to have many friends on Facebook, the majority of them, professional Astrologers. This is a great DVD. Enough to whet your appetite and peak interest in the subject. And yes, the world will not end on 12/21/2012, but if we're lucky at all, the shift will continue.",1355443200,,609,4.648148148148148
8318728,5,B001LMVZS2,"I read the review of this DVD, and bought it any way.  Obviously, the reviewer didn't even watch it.

It is a deep, instructional piece that teaches you how to read charts and goes over the amazing chart of 2012.  It is a great learning tool and entertaining as well.

Finally, it DOES NOT predict the end of the world.

It is a shame reviewers on Amazon can do things like this and get away with it.",1265932800,5,400,4.142857142857143
