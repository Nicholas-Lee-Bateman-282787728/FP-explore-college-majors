6480635,5,B00LDYEAB2,"A must see for anyone interested in Everest and the Hillary expedition, combining contemporary footage and docudrama.",1435017600,,117,5.9411764705882355
6480636,4,B00LDYEAB2,Very good.,1422403200,,10,4.5
6480637,5,B00LDYEAB2,"This film about the first 2 men to climb Everest is a terrific combination of actual 16mm flim of the expedition blended with CGI, and actor reenactments. And it moves between these 3 mediums so seamlessly you can easily forget your watching a recreation of an event that happened over 60 years ago. The narration interwoven with the film by the actual climbers and their family members is tender & heartfelt. This is not a 'flashy, scary' climbing movie like ""Touching the Void"" which I also enjoyed very much. Its a slow moving, thoughtful presentation of 2 men who became the first to climb Everest after 13 men before them had died in the attempt. What does come thru tho is how incredibly brave all the climbers are and just what 'bad-asses' Hillary & Norgay were. You don't have to know anything about Mountain Climbing or 'why they do it?' to enjoy this film. What you come away with is how their conquest of Everest rivals that of Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon.",1418428800,5,973,4.597701149425287
6480638,5,B00LDYEAB2,I thought this movie was done very well and pretty accurate from what I have read.,1418169600,,82,4.1875
6480639,5,B00LDYEAB2,"The story was well told and beautifully recreated.

The filming was superb, many of the shots breathtaking. Make sure you see it on a large screen.",1416096000,5,147,4.653846153846154
6480640,4,B00LDYEAB2,"This is an amazing documentary - I saw it on a plane and wanted to get a copy to share with a friend who is similarly interested in mountaineering history. However -- and this is why it's not getting 5 stars -- the item description failed to mention that only a New Zealand compatible player can handle the disk that I received. This is effectively useless to me. If the item description had mentioned that it was unsuitable for a US DVD player, I would not have bought it.",1407888000,,473,4.325842696629214
6480641,4,B00LDYEAB2,"There is no denying that Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary were total badasses. I'm not sure this movie really did justice to just how brave / talented those guys were, but it was a totally enjoyable film nonetheless. A solid mix of re-enactments, documentary-style interviews, 3D footage shot on Everest and past archival material, Beyond the Edge is totally watchable, a cool breeze on a hot summer's day. Even though the actors were shot in NZ and cleverly edited into the Everest footage, it all works pretty well and does an effective job of telling the story.",1404950400,16,565,4.835051546391752
6480642,4,B00LDYEAB2,"The archival color motion pictures and stills, the voices of the mountaineers, climbers and international experts, the newsreels , 3D recreations and Sir Edmund Hillary all have been assembled to provide a docu-drama film presenting the most accurate and complete story of the first time men stood on the top of the world. As Sir Hillary said, ""It's not the mountain we conquer - but ourselves"". Filming locations include Aoraki/Mt. Cook National Park, New Zealand and Mt. Everest. Highly Recommended.",1404000000,2,501,5.275

8665386,4,B00LDYEAB2,"I enjoyed this re-reation of the first successful Mount Everest climb.  The bravery and tenacity of the expedition members was extraordinary, especially in light of the relative ease of subsequent climbers with today's modern gear.  This is a summit virtually impossible without the aid of Sherpas and porters whose contributions are acknowledged in this film.  Although Norgay and Hillery were indisputably the first persons to make the summit, unbeknownst to me they were not the first team selected to attempt it,  but the backup team after the first team became too exhausted to continue.",1439596800,2,592,5.26595744680851
