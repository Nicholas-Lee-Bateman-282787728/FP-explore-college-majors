I am not Korean and I watched this movie in SIngapore Airlines couple of years ago. It is very touchy and realistic movie. The actors portraying younger version of the hero and heroine does better job. The movie bring tears in your eyes. The script is also well written. Many places  movie moves back and forth between current and past. Movie captures first love meets after 15+ years and their emotional struggles.

Wonderful movie making!",1416873600,,568,4.66

For a low-budget movie, this movie was a smash hit in Korea.

In my view, the theme of the movie is almost universal. What happened to your first love? How did it end? What prevented it from becoming more of an ideal relationship?

Have you ever had first love that never became consummated and resulted in eternal longing?

To really understand the nuance of this film, one needs to understand the Korean's cultural view on first love. Koreans tend to view the first love as the most precious and memorable. The theme of eternal first love is often the subject of many Korean dramas and films. There are many commonalities of first love. People are almost always young when they meet their first love. And because of that, people often make crucial young people's mistakes which they would have never made as a more mature adult.  Only as a full-grown mature adult, people understand how great their first love would have been only if they had known better, but by then, of course, it is often too late. Time stops for no one.

What bothered me about this film was the overall petulance and impatience of the main adult male character. His quick conclusions and tempestuousness makes him a poor candidate for meaningful dialogue with the main adult female character. The result is they have meaningless arguments when they could have had real heart-to-heart talk of emotionally mature adults. That's too bad because this movie could have really touched the hearts and minds even more than it did. Instead, it only strikes a shallow emotional chord with the audience.

Pros:
1)Engaging story of the first love of youth and its profound meaning to the now mature adults.
2)Universal appeal of the first love and how the first love is often ruined by the mistakes of the youth.
3)Awesome theme song (first released in 1994 as a single which never became a hit for some reason).

Cons:
1)Why is the main adult male character so impatient and emotionally tone deaf? The movie could have  been so much better if the two main characters had more meaningful heart-to-heart discussions as adults which never they had as youths. Instead, they have many meaningless arguments which is mercifully mixed with some meaningful dialogue.",1410134400,2,2292,4.841432225063938
