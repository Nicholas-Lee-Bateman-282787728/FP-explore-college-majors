2664503,4,B000IZJR8I,"This movie is funny, yet sometimes its sad like most hindi films. What makes this movie worth watching though is the fact that shahrukh khan is playing a role that he never plays. And i think all his fans will enjoy this different style of his acting.",1242777600,,251,4.361702127659575
2664504,2,B000IZJR8I,"My daughter and I are very much into Bollywood yet this one didn't hit the spot for us as it did another reviewer. Yes I have seen West Side story!
We actually found it a bit boring and not SRKs or Aishwaryas greatest roles. Rather low key and the dances didn't really grab us either.
The focus is on the tit-for-tat thuggery between 2 delinquent gangs (one headed by SRK who did a Fonzie impersonation but without his usual ability to bring something else out of the character)",1226966400,,478,4.443181818181818

8148142,3,B000IZJR8I,"It's hard to say, since I've never watched it. My brother's name is Josh and I thought he might be amused watching a Bollywood movie about a character named Josh. He wasn't that amused, because he's never watched it. I bet it's great, though.",1398384000,,242,4.5227272727272725
8148143,4,B000IZJR8I,Really liked this old film of SRK's with Aisharwarya Rai. Their dance number is really good. Story is much like West Side Story with that great Indian flair for musical drama.,1396224000,,175,4.67741935483871
8148144,5,B000IZJR8I,"I Really enjoyed this movie. Great job by all the actors. Especially Shah Rukh. He hasn't disappointed me yet. He Gives 100% in every role he plays. Just goes to show he really is King of Bollywood. This is a lot like West Side Story, only better I think. And as someone else here put it, to each their own taste.",1383091200,,313,4.147540983606557
8148145,5,B000IZJR8I,"I really enjoyed seeing Shah Rukh Khan as a tough guy in this film. He played the part very well. The element of romance for him in this film was low-key. And even though the romantic aspect of his film roles has always been a highlight, having the romantic intrest low-key did not alter the powerful impact of his role in this film. His protectiveness over his sister was impressive. Aishwara Rai, of course, was beautiful and I loved seeing her in this film. The man who played her love interest did a wonderful job. The similarity to West Side Story was nice. I prefer this film over West Side Story. Shah Rukh Khan drew out strong sympathy in my heart for him at the end of the film. This is a powerful and wonderful film.",1335312000,4,726,4.345588235294118
8148146,3,B000IZJR8I,"The movie itself was fine, and if you're a fan of the stars in question, you'll want to check it out at some point.

Just be aware that this 162 minute movie and probably another hour of features is  crammed onto a single-layer DVD-R. As such they had to compress the heck out of it, hence loss of quality. Not so noticeable on a standard-def 31"" or smaller TV, but upscale to a big screen or HDTV, and it will bother you as it did me, and be a distraction from the performances, choreography, and cinematography. The worst parts of course are when there is a lot of motion on screen. So dance and action sequences are reduced to a pixellated mess. Well, you have to use your imagination for something, I guess.

Hopefully this will become available on more appropriate media.",1272844800,2,776,4.450704225352113
8148147,5,B000IZJR8I,"Director Mansoor Khan took the classic American musical West Side Story and turned it into a distinctly Indian tale. While West Side Story harkens back to America's past, Josh is relevant to contemporary India--with its many contentious ethnic and religious factions--and the film is therefore tinged with an immediacy and realism that's missing from the Broadway musical. Josh takes place in Goa, a city on the western coast of India that was colonized by the Portuguese, and many Goans are Catholic and have European names. The opposing gangs in this adaptation are Catholic and Hindu. Max (played by Shahrukh Khan) is the leader of the Catholic gang and Prakash (Sharad Kapoor) the leader of the Hindu gang. Prakash's sensitive brother Rahul (Chandrachur Singh), who wants nothing to do with the gang, falls in love with Max's sister Shirley (Aishwarya Rai). The Indian version interestingly diverges from the American original with a complicating subplot about a shameful family secret and the reverberations of colonialism. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1253750400,2,1263,6.06145251396648
