2156968,3,B00061QIYK,Interesting collection of vignettes that are barely held together by the apartment building in which they live. I will watch it one more time and maybe the plots will fit better.,1416182400,,178,4.774193548387097
2156969,3,B00061QIYK,very entertaining,1405382400,,17,8.0
2156970,2,B00061QIYK,"This film is a composite of characters, some interesting, others less so. The problem is there really is no story, no true connection between them other than they reside in the same building. The scene where the old man is out of touch with reality is sobering and sad. That performance alone was worthy of the two star rating I give this film.",1403827200,,344,4.476190476190476
2156971,1,B00061QIYK,Too long and crappy plot!  The characters were not given the right beginning... Seemed to start in one direction and then switched character never telling a plot to each.,1399680000,,170,4.862068965517241
2156972,3,B00061QIYK,"Not bad. A little kooky. Character development was not good, or mysterious. I did want to learn some more about Israel, and I did.",1368230400,,130,4.458333333333333
2156973,1,B00061QIYK,Barely a plot to follow. Poor acting and uneven story line.  Don't waste your time watching. Read a book instead,1367712000,,112,4.6
2156974,1,B00061QIYK,"I concur with Mr. Zwick's review below, but I give it one and a half stars, rounded down to one.  It was just dull, dull, dull.",1360972800,,127,3.8846153846153846
2156975,5,B00061QIYK,"Alila is an outstandingly crafted film from start to finish - the cinematography, the music, the script, the acting - and is paced extremely well. Although I must say I prefer Kadosh for its themes and beauty, I consider Alila to be Gitai's most well-crafted film.  The characters are all extremely interesting, Ronit Elkabetz is fantastic in her (unfortunately) rather minor role, and Gitai is able to address a wide spectrum of issues in Israeli society while nevertheless letting the characters and their personal stories dominate the film.  Excellent.",1201824000,,555,5.224719101123595
2156976,3,B00061QIYK,"Amos Gitai is definitely gifted but has a weird style! And he uses the same movie stars over and over.
Alila engages too many confused losers that makes you get lost in the sense of what is going on.
The songs were amazing though!",1197244800,,230,4.25

""Alila"" is a snail-paced series of vignettes about life in one Tel Aviv neighborhood.  The film features roughly a half dozen stories playing out simultaneously, most of them focused on a single apartment building and the people who live and work there.  Gabi is a young woman who's having an affair with an older married man named Hezi, who has set her up in her own little unit in the complex where he comes to visit her periodically for passionate sexual encounters.  The second major plot strand involves Ezra, a building contractor, who is helping to add what may be a possibly illegal wing onto the building.  Ezra, who lives in the van he uses for work, has an ex-wife whom he still loves and can't seem to leave alone, as well as a teenaged son who has gone AWOL from the Israeli army because he doesn't believe in the cause for which the military - and, by extension, the nation - is fighting.  There are several other plot strands running throughout the film, but these two are the most prominent and, in the second case at least, the most compelling.

If writer/director Amos Gitai had managed to pick up the pace a bit and brought a little more cohesiveness to the narrative, ""Alila"" might have been an interesting little movie.  The tale involving the young boy and his divorced parents is, by far, the most intriguing, and one wishes that Gitai had simply made the film about that storyline and jettisoned the rest.  The part dealing with Gabi and Hezi is not only hackneyed and dull, but involves a change of heart on the part of Gabi that is so arbitrary and poorly prepared for that it seems as if large chunks of the film had inadvertently tumbled onto the cutting room floor and been swept out with the trash.  One character in the film even has the incisiveness to analogize Gabi's life to the infamously bad soap opera ""Back Street"" - and how right she is!  Apparently the filmmakers were incapable of perceiving and acting upon the astute self-criticism inherent in the comment.  The other stories are even more dull and uninteresting - although, mercifully, they take up far less running time than this one.  The film touches ever so lightly on such topics as the tensions between Arab and Jew, and the problems of illegal immigrants in the country, but neither issue gets much in-depth analysis from the filmmakers.

The acting is good, especially in the one episode that really counts, but even that isn't enough to pump some badly needed life into the film.  ""Alila"" meanders down its long and monotonous path, only to wind up pretty much where it started at the beginning.",1113177600,13,2606,4.647058823529412
8036466,2,B00061QIYK,"This film has almost nothing to offer just a skewed unexplored view of humans and human nature.  The characters are not credible and not developed and fall flat almost mean-spirited.  Maybe the only true value of such a film for me is the reminder that when there is a divorce from any morality , human history/tradition or broader vision,  it's not worth the time. This is the kind of film, I really do not care for, because it makes the world worse.  Maybe that was the message of the film ........?",1477008000,,501,4.472527472527473
8036467,4,B00061QIYK,"Funny, serious, delirious. A wonderful and original series of real life characters.",1465257600,,83,6.0
8036468,5,B00061QIYK,"This is one of the most creative, expansive, and highly enlightening films I've seen in a long time. It is like Gertrude Stein erupting into film by Gitai breaking all the usual film ""rules,"" creating new ideas, trying things, and taking the viewer on a journey unlike most others being offered in today's television and film offerings. Gitai pulled off a wonderfully breathtaking film. Bravo! Not for the ordinary couch potato but those who seek a new doorway into fresh territory.",1462233600,,482,4.962962962962963
8036469,5,B00061QIYK,It's not the plot. It's the fact that the film excellently captures many aspects of Israeli society at the time it was made.,1459209600,,124,4.434782608695652
8036470,1,B00061QIYK,Not worth watching,1446249600,,18,5.333333333333333
8036471,1,B00061QIYK,didn't watch it past first few scenes; looked like a stinker,1445558400,,60,4.545454545454546
8036472,3,B00061QIYK,"I viewed this after my experience with ""Kadosh"", another Israeli film. Interesting, but not great. I did not enjoy the sexual exploits of Alila; abit too 'kinky' for my taste.",1444694400,,175,4.866666666666666
8036473,1,B00061QIYK,"Pretty bad movie. Watched it out of interest for Mediterranean culture and of Israel. Total organizational chaos, almost all stories are left without closure or any logic: father changes his mind on his son out of blue, mistress turns (not 180 but) 540 degrees from full passion to a full rejection; mysterious break in old man's apartment etc. I am glad I watched it for free, but watching it out to the end just to say it's a POS was still an effort.",1443225600,,452,4.457831325301205
8036474,1,B00061QIYK,"not at all what we expected. pretty trashy, we stopped watching REAL early on.",1443225600,,78,4.642857142857143
8036475,1,B00061QIYK,I'm not sure at all what the point of this film is.,1426118400,,51,3.3333333333333335
