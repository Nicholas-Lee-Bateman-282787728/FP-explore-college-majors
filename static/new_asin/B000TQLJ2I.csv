2907807,3,B000TQLJ2I,"I enjoyed all the animated shorts here, and would rate them four stars as a whole. The Cars short is lacking though. My problem is with the price of $20. You can probably find it on sale at Wal-Mart for $15-$17 on it's release date. Even then, is it really worth it for a collection of animated shorts under an hour, some of  which are already on Pixar DVDs we already own? This is also only the first volume, which means they can get more money out of fans with later releases. I had the same problem with the DVD release of the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (see my review).",1190937600,30,577,4.245454545454545
2907808,4,B000TQLJ2I,"Only ""The Adventures of Andre and Wally B."" and ""Red's Dream"" are not already included with some other Pixar feature length film DVD. Although the 13 short films run a total of just under an hour and all but two are on other Pixar DVDs, you might want this collection for the extras and the fact that you'll have all 13 shorts on one DVD so you don't have to go digging through your collection to find them. A previous reviewer gave the year of production and a brief synopsis. I give a brief synopsis too, but I also give the length of each short, its rating by a popular film database, and on which previous Pixar DVD, if any, you can find each short.

""The Adventures of Andre and Wally B. (2 minutes) - 5.5/10 - Interesting animation experiment at the dawn of the age of CGI, but not much of a story.
Included on the ""Tiny Toy Stories"" VHS tape.

Luxo Jr. (2 minutes) - 7.7/10 - The first computer animated short nominated for an Academy Award. Just a couple of lamps playing ball, but somehow Pixar manages to bring ""life"" to the lamps with the larger lamp acting as parent to the smaller in spite of a lack of any real physical features with which to add expression.
Included with the Toy Story 2 DVD.

Red's Dream (4 minutes) - 6.6/10 - Red is a unicycle that is the only item in the bargain bin at a toy store. He copes with his surroundings by dreaming of better things. Like Luxo, you are made to care about the main character even though he has limited ability to express himself. Shows Pixar experimenting with more complex forms than in previous films.
Included on the ""Tiny Toy Stories"" VHS tape.

Tin Toy (5 minutes) - 7.1/10 - Kind of an early proof of concept of Toy Story. A curious baby is after a wind-up toy. The baby appears monstrous and frightening to the toy until he realizes what the baby wants. Shows you the world - and the baby - from the toy's point of view so you understand his fright.
Included with Toy Story DVD.

Knick Knack (4 minutes) - 8/10 - A Knick Knack from Alaska - a snowman in a snowglobe - wants to join two Knick Knacks from a warmer climate. Only problem is that he is stuck in his snowglobe and must try to find a way to get out. Shows some ideas that look like they gave birth to ""Finding Nemo"".
Included on the DVD for ""Finding Nemo"".

Geri's Game (4 minutes) - 7.6/10 - Won Oscar for best animated short film of 1997. Geri is an elderly man who plays chess with himself and tries to outwit his opponent. It's interesting as he changes sides on each move.  Geri's character also appears as the cleaner in 'Toy Story 2'.
Included with ""A Bug's Life"" DVD.

For the Birds (3 minutes) - 8.1/10 - Won Oscar for best animated short film of 2001. A big jovial bird is rejected by a clique of smaller snobby birds. However, their plan to eject him from his perch backfires when they ignore some of the basic laws of physics.
Included in disc 2 of the Monsters Inc. DVD set.

Mike's New Car (4 minutes) - 7.3/10 - Brings over our favorite characters from Monsters Inc. as Mike tries to show off his new car to Sully. Problem is he hasn't gotten the controls down yet. Not that innovative, but still cute and definitely entertaining.
Included on the Monsters Inc. DVD.

Boundin' (5 minutes) - 7.1/10 - A little preachier than I'm accustomed to from Pixar. A sheep is humiliated after his first shearing, but a jackelope teaches him to think otherwise. Good animation, good music, but the moral tale was just a little too obvious and heavy-handed for Pixar.
Included in the Incredibles DVD set.

Jack-Jack Attack (5 minutes) - 7.7/10 - Uses characters and situations from The Incredibles to show how Jack-Jack first begins exhibiting his extraordinary powers and the babysitter's reactions. Quite funny and quite possibly a deleted scene from the original film.
Included on Disc two of The Incredibles DVD set.

One Man Band (4 minutes) - 7.9/10 - A girl wishing to make a wish in a fountain using a coin finds that her coin is the object of desire for two competing street bands. They do everything under the sun to get her coin - except play exceptional music. Ironically this was a dig at the big studios of the film industry of which Pixar is now a part since their sale to Disney.
Included on the Cars DVD.

Mater and the Ghostlight (7 minutes) - 6.8/10 - The longest of the Pixar films in this set was one of the less amusing. Mater, the tow-truck from Cars, is set up for a practical joke by the other cars. They tell him a story about the GhostLight apparition and then go about making sure that such a ghost appears to him to teach him a lesson about scaring the others.
Included on the Cars DVD.

Lifted (5 minutes) - 8.1/10 - An alien trainee attempts to abduct a sleeping human. Unfortunately, he isn't familiar with the spaceship's equipment yet, and to make matters worse he's getting a job evaluation at the same time. Rather like the X-Files meets Monsters Inc.
Included on the Ratatouille DVD.",1188518400,195,4951,4.402625820568928
2907809,5,B000TQLJ2I,"This is a perfect DVD for kids and families alike. Pixar's theatrical shorts are some of the best -- if not THE best -- cartoons produced in the past two decades. This DVD has all 12 of them released to date, as well as an early short by John Lasseter from his days at the Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Project. Here's the list:

1. ""THE ADVENTURES OF ANDRE AND WALLY B."" (1984, Lucasfilm). After blue humanoid Andr&eacute; is awakened in a forest by a pesky bee, he tries to escape. But the bee (named Wally B.) chases after him, and both characters run off screen. Finally, Wally reappears with a bent stinger. Interesting only for its historical value

2. ""LUXO JR."" (1986). When a large desklamp watches a smaller, younger desklamp play with a ball, he can't quite manage to do it himself.

3. ""RED'S DREAM"" (1987). Propped up in the corner of a bicycle store, Red the unicycle dreams about a better place.

4. ""TIN TOY"" (1988). When a wind-up one-man-band toy sees just how destructive a baby can be, he does everything he can to flee -- until the baby gets hurt.

5. ""KNICK KNACK"" (1989). A snowglobe snowman wants to join a party of other travel souvenirs in a hot party, but his glass dome gets in his way. (This is the well-known version with the less-endowed bathing beauty.)

6. ""GERI'S GAME"" (1997). A man plays a game of chess against himself, 'becoming' each player by moving to the other side of the chessboard and taking his glasses on and off.

7. ""FOR THE BIRDS"" (2001). A group of small birds perched together on a telephone wire reject a larger,  awkward-looking bird, and pay the price for it.

8. ""MIKE'S NEW CAR"" (2002). When Mike (from ""Monsters Inc."") shows Sulley his new six-wheel drive car, everything that can go wrong does.

9. ""BOUNDIN'"" (2003). A shearing leaves a dancing sheep humiliated until a jackalope passes by and demonstrates that it's what's inside that counts.

10. ""JACK-JACK ATTACK"" (2005). Baby Jack-Jack is thought not to possess the superpowers of his siblings or parents (Mr. and Mrs. Parr of ""The Incredibles"") until an outsider is hired to watch him.

11. ""ONE MAN BAND"" (2006). Two one-man bands vie to win the attention of a young peasant girl.

12. ""MATER AND THE GHOSTLIGHT"" (2006). A mysterious blue light haunts the ""Cars"" town of Radiator Springs and its residents.

13. ""LIFTED"" (2007). A bumbling young alien student tests the patience of his instructor as he attempts to abduct an innocent farmer.

Bonus features include a terrific documentary featurette on Pixar and some brief segments the company produced for ""Sesame Street.""",1187654400,442,2589,4.747767857142857

2907864,5,B000TQLJ2I,"Like most animation studios, Pixar also started out with shorts, and I don't mean britches! This 1st-volume DVD and Blu-ray disc contains 13 shorts from 1984 to 2006, from Andre and Wally B. (when Pixar was a division of Lucasfilm) and Luxo Jr. (the first official Pixar short), to Lifted & Mater and the Ghostlight, this whole disc is a wonder to behold! It contains a short documentary of Pixar's origins, 4 Luxo shorts for Sesame Street, and several hidden features, better known as Easter eggs, from Pixar's earliest works! This disc even has 2 shorts that are personal favorites of my sister and Daddy; Geri's Game and For the Birds, respectively, and they both won Oscars for Best Animated Short of 1997 and 2001, and were paired with A Bug's Life and Monsters Inc., in that order! All but 1 of the shorts contain audio commentaries by the gurus (and family members with Mike's New Car) behind the shorts; the only short not to have a commentary is Jack-Jack Attack from 2005. Luckily, KnickKnack is the 2003 print seen with Finding Nemo, so's the kids in the audience won't get concerned about the ""eye candy"" that used to be in it! The original version from 1989 can still be seen on YouTube, as of 2017. You'll get a bang of this shorts collection!",1485388800,,1257,4.616071428571429

From the beginning Pixar understood the importance of real characters with definite goals, no matter how ridiculous the situations they find themselves in.  It's rather amazing that all of these shorts came from the same studio, and represent it's total output of shorts up to its release.  That is, there aren't another fifty out there that are sub-par.  This is it, and they're all just that good.  Pixar gets story, and it shows in this disk.",1464825600,,646,4.631578947368421

2907995,5,B000TQLJ2I,"This set contains thirteen short films that were produced from 1984 to 2006 by Pixar, with the exception of the first one which was made by a division of Lucasfilm. All in all, this set presents all of the shorts well. Most look great in high definition, but the earlier ones are only in standard definition. This set comes with some of Pixar's most well-known short films such as Luxo, Jr., that gave Pixar its lamp mascot, the Academy Award-winning Tin Toy, and my personal favorite short, Geri's Game.

All of the shorts are entertaining in their own regard even if the earlier ones come off as more quirky technology demonstrations before becoming much more character-driven. As a bonus, all of the films, with the exception of Jack-Jack Attack, include an audio commentary. There is also a short documentary about the short films and Pixar's early history.

I found this set to be a great collection for those that like animation. It is especially enjoyable to fans of Pixar.",1436659200,3,980,4.792899408284024

I'd suggest the second, more recent set. I doubt this will get much repeat viewing.",1434412800,,352,4.571428571428571
2908014,5,B000TQLJ2I,"The short cartoon is not nearly as popular as it used to be, but Pixar is trying to help it make a comeback.  They've collected 13 of their shorts in the Pixar Short Films Collection: Volume 1, and it's a must for Pixar fans.

Okay, true, you probably have most of these already.  I know I have most of them on various DVD and Blu-Rays in my collection.  But there were two I don't remember seeing before.  And all of them were fun to see again.

They start with the earlier of their computer animated shorts - ""The Adventures of Andre & Wally B.""  This short clocks in at just an minute and a half, and it features a man trying to out run a bee.  The computer animation is very dated, but it was the early 80's before Pixar spun off from LucasFilm.  I didn't remember seeing this one before or the more atmospheric ""Red's Dream.""  Both of them are fun.

Up next is ""Luxo Jr.,"" the famous short with the lamps and the balls.  There's also ""Tin Toy,"" about a toy trying to avoid being played with by a baby, and ""Knick Knack,"" which finds a snowman trying to escape his snow globe home, from before the days of Toy Story.

My favorite may still be ""Geri's Game,"" about an old man playing chess with himself.

They even have the shorts that were made specifically for DVD bonus features - ""Mike's New Car,"" ""Jack-Jack Attack,"" and ""Mater and the Ghostlight.""

All of these shorts and clever and funny.  While they might have originally been about advances in computer animation, they are still about entertainment.  You've got to laugh at the ending of ""Knick Knack"" and ""For the Birds,"" for example.

One reason to buy this disc are the bonus features.  I got the Blu-Ray, which comes with both Blu-Ray and DVD.  The Blu-Ray has the most of the special features, including audio commentaries on all but one of the shorts, a history of Pixar's shorts, and some of their stuff for Sesame Street.  All told, this Pixar fan loved the bonus features.

So no, you probably don't need this for your collection.  But if you are a fan of Pixar's shorts, you'll absolutely love having Pixar Short Films Collection: Volume 1 in your home.",1433721600,,2126,4.450777202072539

Many of the early short films Pixar used to experiment with 3D animation and improve the art are included here; some very familiar and others fairly obscure. My favorites, including ""Geri's Game,"" ""Jack Jack Attack,"" and ""One Man Band,"" are complimented by both  films developed in the mid-late 80's and such shorts as ""Mike's New Car,"" which feature familiar characters from more recent, full-length movies. My kids were glued to the screen throughout the whole first viewing, which makes the ""Play All"" feature helpful, but now they clamor for specific films, made easy to reach with the standard chapters option.

If you're going for viewing time only, then this is not the collection for you.  However, if you're going for high quality shorts which will give you a few laughs, then this is great.

I sure as heck wouldn't purchase it again if I knew the quality I was going to get. I don't mind getting lesser quality items but I HATE that Disney loves to jack up prices on all of their releases and they go down so little in price.

The music is nice and loud and you can either play the films one at a time or play them all at once, depending on your preference.

2908238,5,B000TQLJ2I,"One of the things we all love about seeing Pixar movies is the innovative and entertaining short subject that always precedes them in theaters. And, yes, most of them are already on the DVDs/Blu-Rays of the movies they premiered with, but sometimes you just want to watch a bunch of cartoons and that means putting in one disc, watching it for five-to-ten minutes, taking it out, putting in the next one and so on and so on. With these short film collections, we can enjoy all the great short films of Pixar in one sitting. This first volume contains:

THE ADVENTURES OF ANDRE AND WALLY B. Not, strictly speaking, a Pixar short, but produced and directed by John Lasseter. It's a very VERY early computer-animated short which, though it definitely shows its age, is still very cute.

LUXO JR. The first REAL Pixar short and the reason there is a hopping lamp in the studio logo. I want a Luxo lamp, but they're really expensive now.

RED'S DREAM. A very early attempt at human animation (making the already creepy clown that much creepier) mars this otherwise delightful cartoon about a unicycle that wants to be a juggler...you read that right.

TIN TOY. This one is a sort of early forebearer of 'Toy Story.' Again, the human baby is a little creepy, but Tinny himself (and his fellow toys) are adorable [NOTE: These first four are not available on any other DVD or Blu-Ray]

KNICK KNACK. Famed vocalist Bobby McFerrin lends his unique style to the story of a snowman living in a snowglobe who tries to escape. This one shows that while Pixar and Disney may be partners now, the animators are clearly influenced by the great Warner Brothers shorts as well (an extended sequence in 'Monster, Inc' parodies a popular Looney Tunes cartoon).

GERI'S GAME. An old man plays a game of chess against himself in this bittersweet cartoon, the first one in which a human is the main protagonist...or rather BOTH of the main protagonists (Geri himself reappears as ""The Cleaner"" in 'Toy Story 2').

FOR THE BIRDS. A snooty group of little blue birds give the cold shoulder to a tall, goofy stranger only to be punished for their elitism.

MIKE'S NEW CAR. Originally produced for the DVD release of 'Monsters, Inc,' John Goodman and Billy Crystal reprise their roles as Sully and Mike in this entertaining short which paved the way for other ""Short sequels"" to Pixar feature films.

BOUNDIN' The animator who, according to John Lasseter, ""Made Woody a cowboy,"" Bud Luckey, wrote, directed and narrates this little fairy tale about a jackalope who teaches a recently sheared sheep a new way of dancing...have you noticed that when you actually write or say the premise to a lot of these cartoons, they sound utterly ridiculous?

JACK-JACK ATTACK. In 'The Incredibles,' Kari the babysitter has a lot of trouble looking after baby Jack-Jack while the Parrs are away fighting Syndrome. This short tells the full story of how this enthusiastic teen became the first person to witness the youngest Incredible's powers.

ONE MAN BAND. Two poor (and highly creative and talented) musicians compete for the charitable offering of one little girl.

MATER AND THE GHOST LIGHT. Mater the Tow Truck from 'Cars' lets his imagination get away from him after hearing a scary story. The first time Mater was placed in a starring role and, evidently, popular enough to spawn an entire series of shorts, ""Mater's Tall Tales"" and the sequel to 'Cars.'

LIFTED. An inexperienced space alien tries to abduct his first human, but keeps goofing up. Luckily his instructor is there to pick up the slack.

My favorites are ""Knick Knack,"" ""Boundin'"" and ""One Man Band."" But that's just me.",1359331200,,3652,4.813099041533547
2908239,4,B000TQLJ2I,"I love that they put together a collection of the pixar shorts. The only issue i have is that it is not segmented out for each short.

2908281,5,B000TQLJ2I,"Most people first knew Pixar when they released Toy Story. However the company has been in business for about a decade before then. Pixar Shorts is a collection of the studio's film shorts starting from 1984 all the way up to Lifted in 2006. The early shorts were not much more than technical demonstrations of the innovations they have made in computer animation. To see this history alone makes the collection worthwhile. If you want to see Pixar's development from the beginning this is the disc to get. Here is a breakdown of the shorts included:

The Adventures of Andr and Wally B. (1984) - This is a short cartoon about a guy and a bee who wants to sting him. Not much of a plot, but my 5 year old loves it. This short was the first to showcase innovative techniques like motion blurring (to make fast moving images more realistic to the naked eye) and shape stretching and squishing. Previous computer animations dealt with rigid geometric shapes. This short demonstrated how much you can make an animation more fluid or even cartoon like just by manipulating the shapes themselves as opposed to making more complex movements. Technically the company wasn't Pixar yet when this short was created. It was Lucasfilm owned The Graphics Group.

Luxo Jr. (1986) - I remember seeing this short in the theaters back in the 80's, but I can't for the life of me remember the movie that came after it. Anyway this is the first official Pixar company. With Steve Jobs investing in the purchase from Lucasfilm we have the company we know and love. Luxo Jr. is about a big and little Luxo desk lamp and their escapade with a ball. This film attempted to get a more photorealistic animation using lighting, shadow and more realistic movements. It paid off because I remember wondering if what I was seeing was real or not (only the lamp's power cables gave it away for me). This tech demo solidified Pixar as a studio to keep an eye on, and they use Luxo Jr as part of logo today.

Red's Dream (1987) - In my opinion this is the least of the shorts... and the saddest story. It's about a red unicycle long forgotten in a bike shop with dreams of fame. It has a film noir feel to it in parts of it with a sad saxaphone solo that almost begs to have James Cagney start a narrative. Again this short was to showcase Pixar's talents and innovations in advanced computer imagery. You have things like more realistic rendered backgrounds, water effects, and improved facial features.

Tin Toy (1988) - Here we start seeing elements of the trademark Pixar and won them the Academy Aware for Best Animated Short Film . I think this is also the first to showcase their own RenderMan software, which they use for years to come. This short is about a little one-man-band toy that is terrorized by a baby. There are some good comic elements in the short and the new software goes further into showing off Pixar's innovations in lights and shading. The baby is their first real attempt at rendering a realistic human being. As eerie as the baby looks now keep in mind this was back in 1988.

Knick Knack (1989) - Flush with success from their previous short Pixar makes their first cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon and wasn't created as a technical demo. Knick Knack is about a character in a snow globe that wants to get out and party with the other souvenirs on the shelf. As such this is a very entertaining short that reminds me of the old Wile E Coyote cartoons Warner Brothers use to make. Bobby McFarrin does all of the music using only his voice and playing beats on his body (a trademark of his at the time). One interesting bit of trivia, when this short was first made the female souvenir characters had more... shape to them. However director John Lassiter made changes to reduce the risk of being risque I suppose.

Geri's Game (1997) - This one most people may know as their first Pixar short when it was released in theaters with A Bug's Life. This is about an old man playing a game of chess by himself. Sounds boring, but it's actually quite entertaining seeing the man playing an alter ego of himself. Another Academy Award winner for Pixar this short wasn't the only time you get to see Geri. Apparently he does toy restoration in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-2-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-w-Blu-ray-Packaging/dp/B0030IIZ56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story 2 (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)</a>.

For the Birds (2000) - One my favorites. This was shown with Monster's Inc and involves a flock of birds socializing on a telephone wire only to be annoyed by a much bigger bird eager to socialize with them. The impending one-sided feud brings hilarious results. Another Academy Award along with an Annie Award and numerous others.

Mike's New Car (2002) - This is the first direct to video short in the collection that came in the Monsters Inc video release. Monsters Mike Wazowski and Sully try take a ride in Mike's brand new car, only to be mired in all sorts of mayhem without even leaving the curb. This is another great physical comedy short kind of in the lines of Tom and Jerry in a way. Lots of monster vs. technology gags.

Boundin' (2004) - This was shown with The Incredibles movie release and was written, directed, starred and music performed by the venerable Bud Luckey. A little background on Bud before we move on. He has been doing animation and music for animation for decades. He is responsible for many memorable cartoon shorts from the classic Sesame Street and has been a major contributor for Pixar since 1990. This inspiring short of Bud's is about a happy go lucky sheep who gets down in the dumps after being sheered, then ridiculed by his friends. A jackalope comes by to give him a different perspective. The whole short is pretty much done as a story telling song which makes me wish Pixar would release a CD.

Jack-Jack Attack (2005) - Another short included on a video release. This time with The Incredibles. It's a parallel story of what was happening while the family was away taking out bad guys and Jack-Jack was with a babysitter. Well his superpowers started manifesting and the babysitter goes through all sorts of crazy situations while staying on her post. It's a perfect tie in to the film.

One Man Band (2005) - This short preceded Cars in theaters. It's about a couple musicians trying to outdo one another for the grand prize... a little girl's preference and a single coin. It was funny to me the first few times, but after my son has played this disk so many times this particular short more than the others (besides maybe Red's Dream) becomes bothersome to watch. This is probably just me, because if you see it at face value it's a rather funny short.

Mater and the Ghostlight (2006) - The third and final short that came included on a video release this cartoon was included in the Cars video release. It's basically an elaboration on a reference Mater mentions a couple times in the movie. The Ghost Light. A practial joking Mater is no longer laughing after hearing a story about the Ghost Light only to experience one that same night. There are lots of sight gags borrowing from the Cars film on this short. Fun stuff.

Lifted (2006) - The short that was released with Ratatouille, this cartoon is all about an alien abduction. Or rather it's a short that looks like it's about an alien going on his alien abduction license test. It's gets really funny seeing the alien react to an even bigger alien writing notes on a clipboard each time he does something wrong, trying to figure out how to use a massive control console of switches, and the impending results on our wayward human victim. This is one of my favorite shorts.

Not only do you get these 13 animated shorts on both a Blu-Ray and DVD disc you also get a lot of other additional features that makes this the Pixar history disc to get:

Commentaries - Just about every short comes with a commentary from the production team. They are engaging and makes you want to hear more.

The Pixar Shorts: A Short History (in HD) - This is a great little documentary on the history of Pixar that includes interview with John Lassiter and other notable Pixar employees. It gives you the scoop on the technologies used. The story behind their history with Lucasfilm, Steve Jobs and Disney. Only wished it was longer.

Sesame Street Clips (in SD) - Four little cartoons that first appeared on Sesame Street. I never saw them so I will update when I do.

There are also three easter eggs in the disc that are basically pre-production videos for Luxo, an animation test of a flag, and something with a chair. The video quality is great, although the older shorts don't really see much of a difference between the DVD and Blu-Ray release. Once you get to Knick Knack and beyond that changes and it's all in gorgeous high definition.

This is a truly great collection of Pixar work. Even if you have the movies on disc where most of these shorts come from you won't have the early stuff. Plus it's good to just have all the shorts in one place. If you enjoy Pixar short cartoons and want to know a little history of the company this is the collection to get!",1346371200,2,9503,4.734582829504232
2908282,5,B000TQLJ2I,Now I don't have to wait for this to come up on TV!  Love the shorts and the music is fantastic.,1345420800,,96,3.5714285714285716
2908283,4,B000TQLJ2I,"Pixar has been around long enough now that an entire generation grew up on it and so perhaps can't fully appreciate just how amazing and groundbreaking the animation studio is. Kids today expect this standard of excellence; they take it for granted. Whereas I, an old grouch who in the past had seen some crap animation, keep on marveling at how Pixar continues to knock it out of the park (CARS 2 aside). Not only do the Pixar folks consistently craft feature-length animated films that become instant timeless classics, they also produce terrific animated shorts.

Most of Pixar's shorts elicit a sense of astonishment from me. The animators take advantage of the brevity of the running time to cut to the chase. These shorts are mostly without dialogue, with the animators often relying on pantomime and visual gags to advance the plot. Pixar boasts a knack for flawlessly anthropomorphizing its non-human subjects. Maybe the most celebrated example of this is the Luxo desk lamp. I shake my head at how expressive a Luxo lamp can be.

PIXAR SHORT FILMS COLLECTION - Volume 1 is a must-have for fans of animation. This set offers 13 short films, most of them clever and adorable and imbued with heart and warmth (although, okay, I really couldn't warm up to ""Boundin',"" ""The Adventures of Andr and Wally B."" and ""For the Birds""). This collection allows you to track the evolution of Pixar's CG technology, with each progressive short increasingly more polished and detailed. Note that, excepting ""Jack Jack Attack,"" each short allows for the option of an audio commentary, with John Lasseter himself commenting on the first five shorts. With a new batch of sterling shorts having been released by Pixar since this DVD set came out - ""Your Friend the Rat,"" ""Presto,"" ""BURN-E,"" ""Partly Cloudy,"" Dug's Special Mission,"" ""Day & Night,"" and ""La Luna"" - a Volume 2 can't be too far away. But, as someone mentioned, if you can't wait for a Volume 2 collection, those shorts not included here can easily be found in other DVDs.

As if not enough people had given plot synopsis, here's another round of breakdown:

- ""The Adventures of Andr and Wally B."" - (1984, 00:01:51 minutes) - About a brief encounter between an android and a bee. Trivia time: John Lasseter put this short together when Pixar wasn't yet Pixar but was still the Computer Division at Lucasfilm. In 1986 Steve Jobs would purchase Lucasfilm's Computer Division and from it would found Pixar. This short may be CG animation at its crudest, but you can't underestimate its historical significance. And, at the time, this sucker was regarded as cutting edge stuff.

- ""Luxo Jr."" - (1986, 00:02:09 minutes) - A pair of adorable desk lamps at play. Awesome!

- ""Red's Dream"" - (1987, 00:04:11 minutes) - A red unicycle dreams of being in the spotlight.

- ""Tin Toy"" - (1988, 00:05:09 minutes) - A brave little one-man-band tin toy babysits a rampaging baby. This short won an Academy Award for Best Short Animated Film.

- ""Knick Knack"" - (1989, 00:03:35 minutes) - A snowman in a snow globe attempts to break out. One of my favorites, with Lasseter channeling his inner Chuck Jones.

- ""Geri's Game"" - (1998, 00:04:51 minutes) - An old man plays chess in the park against a more vigorous opponent. This short won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1998.

- ""For the Birds"" - (2001, 00:03:23 minutes) - Uninterestingly, a flock of tiny birds is perched on a telephone wire when an unwanted and much larger bird tries to join. This won the Academy Award for Best Short Animated Film.

- ""Mike's New Car"" - (2002, 00:03:48 minutes) - Fresh off MONSTERS, INC. Mike shows off his new car to his pal Sully. If you want to hear something cute, the optional audio commentary is provided by the filmmakers' kids.

- ""Boundin'"" - (2004, 00:04:41 minutes) - A depressed, newly sheared lamb gets advice from a wise jackalope.

- ""Jack-Jack Attack"" - (2005, 00:04:45 minutes) - If you'd watched THE INCREDIBLES and were curious about what Jack Jack and his babysitter went thru, here's the baby-sitter's side of the story. But no audio commentary.

- ""One Man Band"" - (2006, 00:04:32 minutes) - Dueling street performers vie for a little girl's gold coin.

- ""Mater and the Ghost Light"" - (2006, 00:07:08 minutes) - One spooky night, perennial prankster Mater gets his comeuppance.

- ""Lifted"" - (2007, 00:05:01 minutes) - In a different slant on the alien abduction theme, a nervous extraterrestrial student takes its driver's test.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- ""The Pixar Shorts: A Short History"" - a fascinating and in-depth look at the genesis of the Pixar Animation Group, with focus on Pixar's first five animated shorts (00:23:33 minutes)
-  4 excerpts from SESAME STREET featuring the Luxo lamps: ""Surprise"" (00:00:22 seconds), ""Light and Heavy"" (00:01:00 minute), ""Up and Down"" (00:00:34 seconds), and ""Front and Back"" (00:00:42 seconds)",1343865600,2,4905,4.859712230215828

I'm sure I will be impressed by the quality of the blue ray on my new compatible TV. Bought it for the silly cartoon with the snow globe. Great to hear Bobby Mac Ferrin's song who did ""don't worry be happy."" I love minutiae, and I love hearing that wood grain was the first pattern they could get a huge slow computer to understand.

Mater And The Ghostlight.  Lifted.  There are some bonus features which include a Pixar documentary segment.  The main reason this is a great DVD in my opinion is that it shows how things changed.  Animation evolves and gets better all the time.  These shorts are not super amazing or even very long but they show the history and are creative.  Overall this is a nice DVD to have.,1325721600,2,713,4.507936507936508

2908313,3,B000TQLJ2I,"Most of these are just promos, less than 5 minutes each, which are used by Pixar to sell an idea. Some are just designs for Pixar commercials. They may have even won some awards... but for those of you who did not have computers in 84 like the rest of us... you won't be impressed. For that period of time, we were literally working with DOS 1.1 and having to write our own software programs in basic just to get our computers to do anything. There was no windows operating system. No internet. Almost no software other than Lotus or games. The best you could get was a computer with one or two 5.25 floppy drives or a 10-20 mb hard drive with a monochrome screen on most and a 300 baud modem. The mainframe computers were even more archaic with a 2 bit bus. So... if you consider this time frame when there was nothing to work with... then yes, these were award winning achievements in animation along the Leisure Suit Larry animation levels. But for those of you today... this animation would not keep a 3 yr old interested. It is probably comparable to the old Claymation animations. So, when it says Pixar... don't expect the Pixar you see today on the first 5 of the 13 short film clips. These first 5 were all pre 1989 crude animations... and some jerk picked CW music for the background sound for the DVD.

However, with that said... there are about 4 cartoons on here which were watchable. One was the Birds on the wire cartoon ""For the Birds""... keeping in mind these are all less than 5 minutes long... and likely a promo to sell an idea for financial backing to obtain funds to make a full movie.

The other 3 short cartoons worth seeing were the Monster's inc Characters with ""Mike's new car"" and the cartoon called ""Jack-Jack attack"" of the babysitter's worst nightmare and the other cartoon clip was the last one called ""Lifted"" about a UFO training session.

Basically, those 4 short films total about 20 minutes of viewing. If you are a collector of videos, cartoons, etc... this might make a good add to your collection if you have run out of other things to buy.

The only other value for this video might be if you have toddlers you want to keep occupied. But it is important to truly understand what you are getting... especially if you are under 40 with different expectations of CGI than was available in the 80's.",1299628800,,2336,4.4637002341920375

2908335,3,B000TQLJ2I,"I bought this movie because I saw it on the Disney Channel and I enjoyed most of the shorts. My favorites are the magician one, the one about the history of rats, and ""Boundin'"".

However, what they don't tell you is that the DVD ends its shorts in 2007 with 'Lifted' (which is on Ratatouille). On TV there are a lot more shorts: all the ones from Wall*E, the other short from Ratatouille about rats ('your friend the rat', I think), all the 'Mater's Tall Tales' ones, etc. Two of my favorites, the magician one and 'Your Friend the Rat', are not on this DVD.

I did really enjoy the Pixar shorts documentary and liked learning about the early days of computer animation; I also like learning trivia about how a specific movie is made. I would have to say that this documentary and the short ""Boundin'"" were the two things I liked about this movie.

I love many Pixar movies (except for The Incredibles, Monsters Inc., A Bug's Life, and UP), and I enjoy Pixar's shorts, but this movie falls flat for me as it is missing most of my favorite shorts and has mostly the ones I like the least.

This movie says it's 'Volume 1'. Does that mean in the future they will come out with a 'Volume 2' which has the other ones shown on TV? I hope so; I would buy it if it had more great bonus features like the documentary, and the other two of my favorite shorts.",1277683200,,1351,4.286274509803921

2908337,4,B000TQLJ2I,I bought this after seeing the Pixar Short Films on tv.  My son loved these.  I was expecting to see all of the short films that were on tv but this only has half of them.  I didn't pay attention to the description which lists all of the shorts and is missing half of the ones on tv including most of the Cars Toons.  It still keeps my son entertained.

When we saw Disney Pixar had come out with a DVD focusing on short films we were thrilling, thinking it would be something a little different for our twin boys.  From the moment the first short film began I became skeptical.  Short is an understatement to the length of the film, if you can even consider it a film.  My 2 yr olds were everything but interested in any of the short films.  Typically we have been happy with most if not all of the movies we have seen, even keeping the parents entertained. This DVD fell completely short of that.  I certainly feel we overpaid for a DVD that did not offer much in terms of entertainment.",1264723200,2,698,4.3307692307692305

Put that technology in the hands of a group of creative storytellers, though, and magic happens!  Pixar's strength shows in the way they successfully couple their phenomenal technical talents with clever, and often touching, storylines.  You will laugh alot at this wonderful collection of shorts, which also includes an interesting chronicle of the companies history, as well as the many improvements in computer animation over the past 20 or so years.",1261353600,,586,5.3478260869565215

There are many other studios producing animations using computer graphics, but Pixar is the leader in quality and innovation by far.  I had seen several of the shorts on other disks, but having  them all in one place is a great idea.

Granted, they were awesome for their time, but if you want to buy this for purely entertainment value, it's not worth it so much. Again, I really like Pixar, so I don't regret my purchase, I just wish it was a bit more entertaining.",1256169600,,410,4.269230769230769
2908371,5,B000TQLJ2I,"I love the Pixar shorts - something that can express a message in less than five minutes can be far more powerful than a 90 minute film. Even more fun is the fact that each of the shorts was designed to develop a concept in animation that could subsequently be applied to full-length features. The documentary included on the disk talks about it, and the history of Pixar. I can't wait to share these with my grandchildren (when they are old enough).",1255564800,,450,4.5

It is so easy to watch them over and over again.  There are interesting commentaries included that provide glimpses into the creative minds behind the stories.  My 2 year old grandbabies really enjoy watching them because they are short enough to keep their attention and they can pick and choose which ones they want to watch.  They have made up their own titles for each ""short"".  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone of any age.  Enjoy!",1245974400,,610,4.921568627450981
2908378,4,B000TQLJ2I,"An excellent inclusive selection of Pixars short films... Many of them produced to show the capabilities of what was avalible for computer rendered animation at the time they were made... and to showcase their flagship software, RenderMan....

Only quibble is that Knick Knack was re-rendered to *sanitize* it for Disney's satisfaction and this does damage the integrity of the original film.. It could have been re-rendered without completely neutering the characters and still keep it ""decent"" but these films were to show what was capable at the time, not to impress your kids originally..I would have liked them to compromise with Disney but they basically gave the character a masectomy... or offer the original un-modified version as a DL with purchase",1245542400,,758,5.264462809917355
2908379,5,B000TQLJ2I,"For the longest time, Hollywood used to release movies in pairs; sometimes it was a short one and a long one, or two long ones split by an intermission, with the first one being the headliner movie, and the 2nd being a throw-in to keep audiences buying popcorn for the theaters.  This pairing disappeared in the early 80's such that by the mid 80's, movies always came out one at a time.  Then came Toy Story in the mid 90's.  Before the main movie was a short cartoon that was just as innovative and original as the feature film itself.  Pixar continued this tradition with every motion picture release since then; to great success.  Now, all of these shorts, along with several extras that never accompanied a major feature, are found in this one DVD, and they are all great.  Together, they are as entertaining as any of the Pixar feature films.  All told, a great DVD and worth the money to buy it.  BTW, the subtitle of Volume I hints at future editions.",1244246400,,959,4.471264367816092
2908380,4,B000TQLJ2I,"Here they are, marvelously all in one place - the short films that were the launch-pad of Pixar. It is a wondrous thing to see them all in one place and sequentially, and to watch the art- and the science - of computer animation develop from the very first tentative effort in ""The Adventures of Andre and Wally B"".  Amazingly enough, the first handful of shorts were intended to be professional demo reels at a convention of computer pros. According to the very informative bonus feature ""Behind the Scenes - the Pixar Shorts: A Short History"" they were supposed to display the technical expertise and accomplishments of the programmers. This reel amply demonstrates how rapidly the concept developed, seemingly in the blink of an eye. The shorts themselves are a mixed bag; those which we responded to most favorably were an equally mixed bag of the early and the more recent:  - Luxo, Jr. featured the antics of a pair of lamps and two inflatable balls, and seemed to be miles beyond ""Adventures"" - and the Luxo lamp is itself still a part of the Pixar logo. ""Red's Dream"" - a marked-down unicycle in a bicycle store imagines a glittering turn in the limelight, and then sadly returns to dreary reality, while in the poignant ""Geri's Game"" an elderly chess player plays a ruthless game - against himself. ""For the Birds"" was just hilarious physical comedy and ""Lifted"" will utterly and forever destroy your capacity of accepting an X-Fileish account of midnight alien abduction with an utterly straight face. ""Boundin'"" was approved by Sunday School teachers everywhere, ""Mater and the Ghostlight"", ""Jack-Jack Attack"" and ""Mike's New Car"" seemed like promos for various Pixar full-length features - although the last two had the additional benefit of actually being funny.",1243123200,,1775,4.953020134228188
2908381,4,B000TQLJ2I,All the short film are very interesting. But most of them already seen before and all the short movie is really short but the casting list is even longer than the movie itself!!!!,1242345600,,179,4.454545454545454

While it did contain the beloved shorts I was looking for, the others the disc included left much to be desired. It might be good for keeping young kids entertained. If you are simply a Pixar short fan like me, stick to only buying the movies you like with the shorts on them. It's not worth the money for the two times you'll probably watch this DVD.",1234915200,7,467,4.571428571428571

It's fun to see the Pixar Lamp for the first time, and it's amazing to see how long they've been doing this.  A CG short from 1984?  That's crazy!

is the tin toy versus baby short. Since then I have watched all of the commentary on the DVD about Pixar and how each short was created and it's really quite interesting. The best thing about these shorts is that they are still amusing even after mutliple viewings.",1231804800,,406,4.652777777777778

Pixar is the best animation studio around and these shorts are just a sneak peek into their great storytelling ability.",1229817600,,293,4.140350877192983
2908404,4,B000TQLJ2I,"This is a collection of Pixar's 32 short films so far along with a history of how Pixar got into the business of making short animation.

The first film I saw in theatres, ""Gerri's Game"" depicts an old man playing chess in the park with himself.  We also see Luxo and Luxo, Junior, the desk lamps with lives of their own.  The last films show alternate views of the lives of our friends from ""Monsters, Inc"", ""Cars"", and ""The Incredibles.""

What's so inspiring about this film is the animators themselves and what they went through to bring these characters to life.  Some of the details are a little geeky, but utterly fascinating.

Also, there are some bonus items which are fun.  One other nice thing is that the shorts are on blu-ray and since I won't be replacing all of my Pixar movies with blu-ray discs, I at least have the shorts in HD.

For those not familiar with Pixar Shorts, they are made to exhibit new technologies and CGI techniques.  There isn't one short that I don't enjoy.  I always get a chuckle from Gerald's Game and Boundin' is pure delight.",1225411200,2,584,4.3119266055045875

2908420,5,B000TQLJ2I,"My daughter received this for her birthday and loves it.  She wants to watch it every day and it has quickly eclipsed her favorite movies.  She is so tickled by all the shorts.  While we own all of them with each Pixar movie, it really is a treat to have them all lined up together in one package.

I am really in awe of how good the early pieces are from the 80's.  It certainly goes to show that it is the story that drives the films, even the earlier work with less finesse by today's standards still is amazing and endearing.",1219536000,,529,4.147058823529412
2908421,5,B000TQLJ2I,"If a feature-length animation corresponds in some way to a novel, then a cartoon like one of these corresponds to a short story - you know, five or ten pages, and you're done before the coffee gets cold.

In this case, you'll just forget the flippin' coffee. Each little featurette is a gem unto itself. ""Luxo Junior"" showed the absolute mastery of characterization over body - those two show more personality in that little interlude than Keanu Reeves has shown in his whole life. ""Red's Dream"" - well, words just don't do it justice. I saw it back on the Siggraph circuit, and its emotional impact has lost nothing in the decades since. ""Jack Jack's Attack"" just reminded me that being really funny means being real. Kari came across as real and more than real, down to her sprawling gestures in telling her story. And, it laces in nicely with ""The Incredibles.""

In terms of absolute volume, there's not a lot here. But it's dense, and that gives it the mass to warrant attention. Pixar has always been on the out-there edge of animation, and this shows the edge at its sharpest.

By the third short, Pixar finds their legs and and accelerates.  From a slow start in 1987 to a hilarious piece from 2007, this DVD spans 20 years, showing steady improvement in technology and concept.

Each piece stands alone, almost all are brilliant, and all are part of the DNA of Pixar as elements of older shorts continue to show up in the following pieces.

2908444,5,B000TQLJ2I,Pixar pioneered a new form of animated film and these shorts show the evolution of the art form that transformed the face of animation. This collection of shorts is a must-own for any fan of animated films.,1209772800,,206,4.594594594594595
2908445,4,B000TQLJ2I,"This is a charming collection of Pixar short films plus extras like a brief history of Pixar shorts, segments from Sesame Street and audio commentary. The films range from the very basic like Andre & Wally B from the early days, to the sophisticated like One Man Band, a filmette about 2 street musicians competing for a coin from a little girl in a European town square.

My favorites include Tin Toy in which a destructive baby goes on the rampage while the terrified toys cower under a couch and a drummer-boy toy tries to appease the little urchin, the uplifting Boundin' - the story of a sheep that suffered from depression after shearing until a jackalope comes by and brings out spectacular new talents in the sweet animal. This one has great country music and the story is a rhyming poem.

Jack-Jack Attack is the scary tale of a babysitter trying to control a weird baby who has supernatural powers, and in Knick Knack a snowman desperately tries to join the fun in the sun by attempting escape from his snow dome - the music here is especially charming. Another good one is Mater and the Ghostlight, a story of cars and trucks with a great country & western soundtrack.

I also enjoyed For the Birds, a simple story of little bluebirds who were nasty to a bigger, awkward bird and paid for it by losing their feathers, and Lifted, the story of an attempted UFO abduction that didn't quite work out because of the incompetence of the trainee abductor. Those who have seen Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and The Incredibles will probably not be too impressed, but I found the DVD highly entertaining and informative.",1209686400,,1631,4.6366782006920415

Hopefully these volumes will contain shorts that are new and exciting and haven't already been purchased by all of the parents out there who already own all of the Pixar films.  As has already been stated by many of the other reviewers, this is simply a compilation of the shorts that are already on all of the other Pixar DVDs.  True, two of them were only available on a VHS tape which I don't believe is out on DVD currently, but these two are hardly worth the price of this DVD.  Both are older extremely short clips that will not hold the attention of your children.  The only really interesting quality on this DVD is the commentary that you won't find on the other DVDs.  But I would suggest renting rather than purchasing.

If your intention is to buy this for your kids, you probably already own it.  If you are an adult and interested in breakthrough animation I would point you in the direction of Spike and Mike's Animated Film Festivals.

After you get past the ads and into the main menu, you lose the sound. I have a brand new system and one of the first disc's I try to watch has no sound. Is it the disc, the player, the tv, or the audio system? A ""Geek Squad"" person tells me the bd player is defective. I return it for a new one. Still does not work. The next ""Geek Squad"" person tells me the disc is defective and to exchange it for a new one. Still does not work. I call sharp and they walk me through a software update, which does nothing.

Finally I just google BD-HP20U and Pixar and find several threads in various AV forums with people complaining that this disc simply does not work with the aquos player...

Quite a bit of greif this disc caused. Should come with a warning ""Do not buy if you own one of these BD players..""",1206316800,4,1073,4.124401913875598
2908462,5,B000TQLJ2I,"This DVD is a collection of all the Pixar short films that have been released to the public before, either on VHS or DVD.  Most of the shorts are currently available on DVD with the movies that they were shown before, e.g ""Lifted"" is on the RATATOUILLE DVD.  ""The Adventures of Andre and Wally B."" and ""Red's Dream"" were only previously available to the public on the TINY TOYS VHS tape.  The shorts are listed below.

""The Adventures of Andre and Wally B.""--This was one of the first Pixar shorts created. It's a very short film about a boy in the park, Andre, who is chased by a bumble bee, Wally B.  There isn't much of a story here, but it does have a couple of very funny moments and is worth seeing for it's place in animation history.

""Luxo, Jr.""--This is the short that gave Pixar its logo mascot. This was also the first computer animated short film nominated for an Academy Award. A larger Luxo lamp and a smaller Luxo lamp play with a ball.  The relationship between the lamps is made clear without any type of facial expressions or words.

""Red's Dream""--On a dark and rainy night, a red unicycle is left alone in the discount bin and dreams of performing in a circus with a circus clown.  The shapes and forms are more complex than those in ""Luxo, Jr."" and illustrate the further developments in computer animation.

""Tin Toy""--A wind-up tin toy and a ""giant"" baby interact.  Was shown before TOY STORY.

""Knick Knack""--a snowman in a snowglobe from Gnome, Alaska attempts to get out so he can join knick knacks from warmer climates, especially the beautiful woman.

""Geri's Game""--Geri is an aged man playing chess with himself throughout the day in the park. An excellent short piece to illustrate the power of facial expressions.  I've used this short before as in introduction in some acting workshops I've been a part of. Won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film of 1997.

""For the Birds""--A large funny-loving bird wants to join some smaller birds sitting on a wire. The smaller birds start making fun of the bird and don't want to have anything to do with him. However, in the end the large bird gets the last laugh.  This short won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film of 2001.

""Mikes New Car""--Mike from MONSTERS INC. gets a new car and wants to show Sully his new wheels.  However, the car has as many controls as a spaceship and Mike just doesn't know how to operate everything.

""Boundin'""--A sheep who likes to dance becomes the laughing stock of his neighborhood after his first shearing.  However, a jackalope comes bounding along and teaches him not to be such a mope, but to enjoy life.  This is my favorite of the Pixar shorts and I love the song.

""Jack-Jack Attack""--This five minute short fills in what happened with Baby Jack from THE INCREDIBLES and the babysitter while the family was off fighting Syndrome.  This is a very funny short.

""One Man Band""--A young girl goes to a fountain to drop a coin in and make a wish. However, before she can drop in her money a one-man-band gets her attention.  She gets ready to give him her coin when another one-man-band across the plaza attracts her attention.  What follows is a musical duel between the two men in an attempt to get her coin.  This short was as much about music as it was visuals.  The characters actually look like they are playing their various instruments and when they play against each other together, they actually sound better than when they just play alone.

 ""Mater and the Ghostlight""--Mater, from CARS, loves to do practical jokes.  His friends decide to get back at him by telling him a spooky story about the mysterious and haunting Ghostlight that spells trouble and doom for whoever it appears to.  When he goes home that evening, the Ghostlight appears and chases him everywhere he goes.

""Lifted""--This short is all about a young alien attempting to pass his sleeping-human-abduction test.

 All of the shorts except ""Jack-Jack Attack"" include commentaries.  Most of the commentaries are done with the filmmakers who made the films and are technically informative.  Only the commentary for ""Mike's New Car"" isn't; it's done by some of the filmmaker's children.

Also included on the DVD are some shorts with Luxor, Jr. that were done for Sesame Street illustrating concepts such as ""Up and Down"".  Lastly, the DVD also includes the featurette ""The Pixar Shorts: A Short History"". This featurette tells the history of Pixar and how the group went from being a small group of people working at a computer hardware company became the penultimate computer animation studio.

If you own the entire Pixar library, you already have most of the shorts that are on this disc. However, I like the DVD because it has allowed me to have all of the company's released shorts on one DVD.",1204588800,2,4807,4.689737470167064

I liked the idea of the compilation, so I created my own ""music-mix tape"" equivalent by extracting each of these ""shorts"" from their respective DVDs that I own, and even extracted shorts from other movies such as Ice Age, and Over the Hedge to include on the final compilation DVD as well.

I then burned my own DVD of all of these shorts (Legal in the US if you own all the original DVDs, and it is a ""compilation"" for your own use and not redistributed or provided for others).

From their humble beginnings to the animation giant they are now, we get a peek into the company that revolutionized the way society looks at computer generated animated feature films.  Although many of the shorts can be found on most of the Pixar feature film DVDs/ Blu-Ray discs, the commentary is great for anyone who would like to understand what was going on in the computer animation industry, as well as within Pixar themselves.

After reading some of the ""not so great reviews"" of this collection from others, it never ceases to amaze me how critical some can be. Yes, some of the cartoons may be older, but what do you want? Some people fail to remember what animation used to look like. It has gotten so good these days that at times I feel we expect perfection. I guess that is just a reflection of the gotta have it now, bigger and better attitude that prevails these days with this generation. Give it a rest people and just love it for what it is!!!",1202860800,,627,4.190082644628099
2908468,5,B000TQLJ2I,"My now-husband and I used to go to animation festivals when we were dating in college in the late 80s.  I was an art and design major, and I was really fascinated with the animation.  Back then, working with computers was still pretty futuristic.  Pixar was definitely a part of my fondest memories from those showings, and I was so thrilled that this DVD is now offered.  I love that this DVD is put together in chronological order.  It does show the transformation of the technology. In the earliest shorts, what now looks jagged and rough, was the leading edge technology at the time.
In the ""extras"", there is a great documentary outlining the history of Pixar animation.  There is also the option to have commentary on each of the shorts, which is also a treat.  The only one I have been able to listen to is the one for ""Boundin'"" which I was interested in, because I had never seen it before, and it is my new favorite.  The man who narrarated the short explained the concept behind it, and many of the details.  This made for a more complete experience for me.
My two daughters really enjoy these shorts, we have watched it together a few times now.  My 4 year old has huge belly laughs throughout.  I highly recommend it.",1202774400,3,1230,4.4708520179372195

They've got a lot of the older ones on here two, so it's fascinating to see the progression in the technology of computer animation and what they could do.  The first couple shorts of course look like crap compared to what we are used to, but it's interesting when you realize they were made on computers with less processing power than your cell phone.  It includes a nice ""history of Pixar"" thing that explains a lot of that.  Also, computer animations (the recent ones anyway) offer easily the most noticeable upgrade in visual quality between BluRay and DVD.  Often DVDs look just as good as BluRay for real live action (at least on my 32"" 720p Samsung), however good computer animations like Pixar's post Toy Story work looks much better in BluRay.

2908490,4,B000TQLJ2I,"The real value in this collection isn't so much the collection itself, which sadly is too small, or too short, and is over before you know it (which may make you sad if you buy this disc with the wrong expectations).  The value is really in the history of all of these animations and of Pixar itself.

Each individual short is entertaining in some way, though they are short films and aren't intended to last more than a few minutes each.  Many times the credits roll on seemingly longer than the shorts they accompany.  But... if you recognize the history of computing and computer animation that is involved here, you realize just how much work went into these shorts and how truly amazing they are given the technology available when most of these shorts were created.

Perhaps the most 'priceless' (to borrow from the credit card commercials) portion of this collection is the included documentary: The Pixar Shorts: A Short History.  It looks at the players involved, the hardware involved, and the work that went into creating these classic works.  How Pixar Animation Studios came to be, and why they were creating these shorts.

Taken in context with the shorts themselves, you realize just how far we've advanced when it comes to computer animation and animated film.  Technology that shows up in video games, movies, virtual reality for training purposes and more.

Pixar was on the forefront of the tech and this collection does a good job of introducing viewers to all of that great history.  Worth a full price purchase?  Probably not so much.

The bonus material included 4 shorts that were used on Sesame Street along with a great look into how it all happened.  The behind the scenes creation of Pixar, from a way to show case a product into what we know and love today is not necessarily as entertaining for children, but it is quite fascinating for all to see where what we know and love came from.

So is it all new work?  No, but it is called a collection and it is well worth it.",1198540800,,598,4.2105263157894735

2908520,5,B000TQLJ2I,"Even as an adult, I still love cartoons, and Pixar consistently delivers quality goods. This collection of thirteen short films by the venerable studio is easily among the best DVDs I've bought (or, in this case, received for Christmas).

The films themselves are arranged in chronological order, allowing the viewer to watch Pixar's technology and stories mature and become more sophisticated with each project. And, in an unusual turn for a film company, their ideas actually improve with each story. Pixar always amazes me with their ability to tell a story without words, as in ""One Man Band,"" ""For the Birds,"" and my old favorite ""Geri's Game."" Every short on this disc is heartwarming and witty--high praise coming from a stodgy pessimist like myself.

The quality of the DVD itself is also impressive--the picture is almost always sharp (a few of the early shorts are a bit hazy) and the sound is excellent, particularly in the more recent shorts, like ""One Man Band."" The special features are nice but not great--the big selling point is the shorts themselves, and I'm happy to say they're worth every penny.

Highly recommended.",1198540800,3,1137,5.005291005291006

I am a huge Pixar fan so it was neat to see some of the old films but I have seen most of these before on their movies (part of the extras of Pixar movies).

2908540,5,B000TQLJ2I,"I watched this dvd and I swear I laughed so hard I choked! First off I do have to distinguish between the Pixar shorts and the ""Disney-Pixar"" ones.  The Disney-Pixar ones - Mike's New Car, Jack-Jack Attack and Mater & the Ghostlight - don't fit in too well with the Pixar only ones and as far as I'm concerned they could have skipped them all together or at least put the 3 together at the end. However, Pixar animated them so all 13 are here, in chronological order.
The Pixar shorts Geri's Game, Knick Knack, Lifted, and my absolute favorite One Man Band are funnier than a lot of ""real"" movies I've seen. Watching this dvd is also watching the evolution of Pixar.  You can see how their animation and story building skills grew and improved over the course of time. The first short, The Adventures of Andre & Wally B. - which was done by the Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Project - is technically simple and the baby in Tin Toy is kind of creepy looking, but by the time you get to Lifted things have progressed nicely. But the great things about all the Pixar shorts is the emotion in them. You actually feel sad at the end of Red's Dream and recognize the feelings between Luxo, Jr. and the grown-up Luxo. You can feel Geri's excitment over his chess victory and the Snowman's frustration at not being able to join the warm weather knick knacks. I've seen humans in 2 hour long ""live action"" movies with less emotion than I saw in these shorts.
As I said, to me the weakest shorts in the collection are the 3 Disney ones related to their movies. They look nice but the stories are weak and not funny. But to be able to see the ""real"" Pixar shorts whenever I want to is a real treat for me.",1196726400,2,1692,4.334384858044164
2908541,4,B000TQLJ2I,"Finally...  Pixar, after promise-after-promise, released a DVD with all of their animated shorts!  Volume one, though?  I looked for Volume 2, to no avail...  Perhaps they are just leaving their options open, a reasonable move, I think!

I love this DVD...  I have been watching Pixar grow up for years, and I have been FASCINATED by the growth and advancements in the animation.  If for nothing else, it was worth the effort for me.

Others might not be quite so entranced by the early work...  Tin Toy, for example sports a Frankenstein-ish baby, and the animation is nothing short of ""gah!"", but I find it interesting to see from where we have come.  The space-awareness carries the most interesting advances for me.  I have noticed that even in the earliest works, anything with a random pattern seems to be the most believeable; water, leaves, rocks, hair...  All of these are most easily believed in CG.  Things we all know, and see every day, humans especially, seem to require the most work, the most polish.  This, I believe will be the Holy Grail of CG, when they can animate to such a degree a humanoid character, so as the viewer truly doesn't know he's viewing a figment of some programmer's mind.  It's on the way, I think.

If you have all of the Pixar features, you have nearly all of the selections on this DVD, save the earliest ones, but for the true Pixar afficianado, it's a necessary addition to your colletion, truly.",1196640000,,1440,4.654761904761905

These 8 in terms of quality were very good and my personal favorite was For the Birds.  Everything else was a little short and had no story to it.  It was more of a technical demo back in the 80's and nothing extraordinary there, both picture quality wise and audio wise.  They really should have priced this disc at half the cost and sold it on amazon for $9.99.  Otherwise, I have to agree with others that it's not worth this price.",1196467200,,535,4.257425742574258

2908545,5,B000TQLJ2I,"There are two bounteous DVD buffets on sale at the same time - Ratatouille and this superb DVD assemblage of Pixar shorts that literally takes you through its history and astonishing progress from 1984's ""The Adventures of Andre and Wally B.,"" produced when the small group was basically an experimental arm of Lucasfilm Ltd. to 2007's ""Lifted,"" released in theaters with Ratatouille.

It does become clear, watching one short after another, that no matter how much more detailed and eye-popping the techniques become, the core is still the story and the characters. You really do know you're watching a Pixar film no matter when it was made. That's pretty rare nowadays.

It's also fun to pick out your favorites, or debate the strengths or weaknesses of your picks with your friends and family. It's also nice to have all the audio commentaries accompanying each short (except Jack-Jack Attack, which has that great ""Jonny Quest""-like title music stab that never fails to make me smile.)

This is probably also the first time we've seen Sesame Street materials on a Disney DVD - there are a handful of appealing concept segments starring Luxo, Jr. as special features. And there's also a mini-documentary to tie all the films together.

This makes a really nice companion to the TRON Special Edition DVD, which includes a lot of material by those who pioneered computer animation (there are even a parallel scenes of a digital juggler). John Lassiter himself appears on the disc, commenting about TRON's influence on everything that came after it.",1195689600,4,1549,5.01556420233463

2908563,4,B000TQLJ2I,"An informative and historical look at the progression of computer animation, the Pixar Short Films Collection is an entertaining gathering of all the Pixar short animated projects, several winning Academy Awards and other prestigious recognitions.

Early on, the Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Project developed a short computer animated sequence to demonstrate that a story could be told with simplistic 3D characters. That project was The Adventures of Andr and Wally B., a rather uneventful film about an oddly Donald Duck-like blue creature that has a run in with a wide-eyed bumblebee. Despite its current undistinguished and archaic animation, it wowed audiences at that year's SIGGRAPH expo (a convention on the advancements of computer graphics).

Still sporting the old Pixar logo, Luxo Jr. introduces the world to the new icon that now precedes every Pixar film. Luxo, nothing more than a common desk lamp, is able to show a wide assortment of emotions through head movements and body language, the very staple of animation.

Red's Dream, about a unicycle dreaming of performing at a circus, makes excellent use of Pixar's trend of personifying inanimate objects. A dark and gloomy atmosphere makes this short reminiscent of film noir, which allowed the animators to show off rain and beautifully dusky lighting.

Tin Toy experiments with a human baby character, attempting more realistic movement and character modeling, despite the fact that the child turned out to be absolutely hideous. Knick Knack sweeps us into the predicament of a snowman stuck in a snowglobe desperately trying to join other ornaments basking in the sun on a nearby shelf. Ending in a great and sad punchline, Knick Knack is one of the cleverest of the animated shorts.

Geri's Game features an old man playing a devious game of chess... against himself. Slowly but surely, he gets up from his seat in a park to pose as his own opponent who appears to be more sinister and a superior chess player. Zero dialogue makes this film a masterly examination of expressions and movement. Reaching a new high in animation realism, Pixar's next short, For the Birds highlights fur and feather effects in a funny skit about an outcast bird.

Mike's New Car, Jack Jack Attack, and Mater's Ghost Light are extensions of their animated features counterparts and show further episodes with familiar characters. These shorts have reached an amazing level of picture perfect lighting and movement realism, despite their overly cartoonlike character designs. One Man Band is about two ""one man bands"" facing off against each other for the coin of a small child who is about to throw it into a wishing well. Lifted debuted in front of Ratatouille theatrically and is also included on that DVD, and is a delightfully funny short about inept space aliens.

Special features include Sesame Street clips and The Pixar Shorts: A Short History, which is actually a fairly in-depth look at the evolution of Pixar and computer animation. While almost all of these films can be found on various other Disney DVDs, it's about time that audiences can view all of Pixar's finest animated short film achievements in one convenient place.

2908564,2,B000TQLJ2I,"I received Pixar Shorts on Blu-ray last Friday.  You'll find less than an hour of video inside, spread across 13 shorts, and that's its downfall.

Only three or four of the shorts are what I'd consider memorable.  At least one of them (One-man band) is already on another disc (I think it's on Cars).  ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" is just another short taken from Cars -- might even be one of the ""deleted scenes"" from Cars, actually, but I haven't looked to check.

The blu-ray transfer quality of this title is really great.

My girlfriend and I really enjoyed ""Geri's Game,"" and ""For The Birds"" the best.  The others looked awesome, but didn't draw me in like those two shorts did.  ""Mike's New Car"" was made with the characters from Monster's Inc., but the screen size was only 4x3 instead of 16x9.  Kind of disappointing.

I'd only consider this worth about $5, in my opinion.  I wish I had purchased Cars instead, even though I already have that on DVD.  Purchase this title only if you are an animation freak, or a big Pixar fan.",1194393600,12,1034,4.52972972972973

All have been released as bonus features on Pixar's previous DVD releases, from Toy Story on forward to Cars and the forthcoming Ratatouille. From the first to the most recent, Pixar animators get better and better at the technical demands of creating images in the computer...these videos, especially the last few, are amazingly lifelike.

Most of these are personal projects or experiments by staff animators, and they are labors of love. If you already own the ""Pixar collection"" up to this point, you have these movies. If you only own a few Pixar movies, this is the way to catch up. Highly recommended for newbies and collection completists.",1194220800,40,723,4.975206611570248
2908566,5,B000TQLJ2I,"I have seen most of these shorts, and they have all been extensively (and repeatedly!) summarized on here. The featurette that talks about the beginning of Pixar and how these shorts came to be was really incredible. Seeing the evolution of Lasseter & company was really cool; it was crucial that the techno geeks work alongside the artists. Computer animation at Pixar developed out of this sitting-next-to-each other discovery period. Also amazing how big the computers were and just how much disk space a few frames could take up. And yes, I've read the complaints about all these shorts being available on other DVD's; however, it's really an educational process to watch these shorts in chronological order, and see how not only did the technology develop, but the storytelling and characterizations as well. I mean - how incredible in Luxo Jr is it to actually humanize a lamp? FRIGGIN' BRILLIANT! The way that life and emotion are bestowed upon this everyday ordinary object is sheer creative genius. Add this one to your collection! The Sesame Street shorts are okay, but just more of the same Luxo, only the resolution quality seems to be much lower.

Overall, the shorts are pretty good but some being so old means they are pretty dated.  This makes you appreciate how far weve come in the Pixar experience.  I knocked it down one star just because of the presentation.  Their description really promotes more recent movies from the creators, but the shorts aren't from this decade. So although I enjoyed the shorts and respect the history of these, I felt it was a deceiving listing.  Plus the box says disc made in Mexico.

To parents of young ones I will say that this was perfect for my toddlers.  One of ours doesnt have the attention span for a whole movie but she was able to make it through these.  Plus if we only had time for a couple minutes worth of movie, we could still squeeze one of these in before bedtime.
