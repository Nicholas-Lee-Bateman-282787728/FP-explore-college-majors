8421553,5,B004B6W4QW,"I saw this movie when it was released in Westwood, and I got to say hello to the Young family and I even took a picture with Nick Young.

This is an incredible story that is very well told, very well filmed, and takes you deep into the family's lives and struggles.  It is heartwarming to say the least.

Nick is an excellent example of quality character and his unwavering smile is a rare gem of human spirit.

Don't hesitate to buy this documentary, it's story and lessons can be viewed for generations to come.",1363824000,,513,4.368421052631579
8421554,4,B004B6W4QW,"Being a filmmaker myself that has to do just about everything like Ms. Matlock has, I respect and love the hard work, money, and time she gave to this film. Some funny subplots and some good heartwarming scenes. Believable quality performances by Cheryl Matlock & Shaun Conway.  I look forward to the next works from Matlock.",1355788800,,325,4.803571428571429
8421555,5,B004B6W4QW,"I saw this movie when it opened in Westwood and like Nick Young, it is a winner. A truly compelling story about a young man who wouldn't let any setback stop him from living out his dreams. Heartwarming as well as heartbreaking this movie is not to be missed. As one of Nick Young's high school teachers, I saw his story unfold in real life. This movie does a great job of capturing the real life drama that Nick had to overcome. Even if Nick Young had never played a single game in the NBA, he would be an American success story due to his fine character.",1332115200,6,556,4.205607476635514

Kahara reminded me of Betty, when we first got married, I had to ""dispose"" of some of her culinary creations (esp the biscuits!!!), but she got it together quickly as my big ass is a living testimonial. Anyway, the movie moved at a good pace, never boring or dragging scenes out. Plenty of humor, Betty thought it was funny taking Monica to jail, your explanation had me cracking up. Ol' girl had a condom ready for the third round! The love scenes were cool, tasteful, not too graphic but definitely adult, as most of us can relate to the different situations. It's the type of movie that one has to see several times to get the full enjoyment out of it. Tha acting was great too. I hope Ms. Matlock does another soon, as long as you're in it!",1304467200,,763,4.3426573426573425
8421557,5,B004B6W4QW,"This film was fresh from the same old hollywood feel but yet with good production of the same. Very well thought out with the characters involved and were very relatable. This feature have well place humor, drama, and was delightfully inspiring, it defintely keep my attention. As far as a second chance this movie really deserves a first chance. I showed this dvd purchased eailer to a co-worker now he's paying me order a second dvd for himself.",1301270400,,447,4.743589743589744
