6339404,5,B00J925RX0,A lot of funny moments. Very good comedy with good results. It was as expected.  Everything OK.  One two three,1402963200,,110,4.45
6339405,4,B00J925RX0,"A lot of overacting but funny results, very lighthearted comedy with good results.  The story of a straight laced man whose Jewish parents and extended family discover that he is gay and the resulting comedy scenes are enjoyable.  The cast is cute, especially the Mom and Dad, who have some funny discoveries of their own.  They send home the usual ""whose to blame for making my son gay"" routine with funny results.  I enjoyed this tongue-in-cheek look at coming out to family, but don't take it too seriously.  3.5 stars for good humorous results, recommended 06152014",1402790400,,569,4.885416666666667
6339406,2,B00J925RX0,"I'd been waiting to see this film since its original release in 2009, it was touted as a comedy and I was extremely anxious to see it. I found it to be mildly amusing but was a little disappointed in the film itself. I'm a fan of all the recognizable actors and with that said watch for yourself and you be the judge. If a friend asked should I watch the movie, I would tell them it's ok, nothing special and to check it out for themselves.",1402704000,,440,4.068965517241379

6339525,3,B00J925RX0,"Cute movie, but feels dated. It may have been released in 2009, but it looks like it was filmed in 1995 given how the movie represents society's attitudes towards gays. Plus, the Jewish mother character is a bit overboard.

That being said, parents of gay and lesbian children who've recently come out may find this movie helpful in coming to terms with news of their children's sexuality. The movie is really more focused on the parents' journey upon hearing that their son is not only gay, but is also in a committed relationship.

It's definitely a very ""mom and dad""-focused movie. It would be nice if there were more movies that parents of LGBT children could relate to.",1438300800,,675,4.711864406779661

6339554,1,B00J925RX0,"This story had a lot of potential, and they could have done so much more with this story. It is a story of a 25 year old man (Nelson), living in a beautiful apartment (which means that he is doing well financially on his own), with his boyfriend (Angelo).  He has a nosy pushy Jewish mother who keeps introducing him to Jewish women, trying to persuade him to get married. Nelson and Angelo finally get the courage to tell their parents that they are gay and in love and they want to adopt a baby. The parents are shocked and not accepting. I found it strange that these two men knew that they were gay all of their lives, but just never ""came out"", and that no one ever suspected that they were gay. It was also strange that the Jewish mother did not suspect that her brother (Max) was gay (for twenty years). This is a nosy pushy lady who is always in everyone's business, yet she has no idea that both her son and brother are gay. Nelson's parents and Angelo's parents have teenage children still living at home who they seem to be ignoring, and they are more interested in the lives of their adult sons who have moved out. It was not funny, and the ending wrapped up very quickly.",1421020800,3,1184,4.285714285714286

6339563,2,B00J925RX0,"I thought this movie was hysterically funny and heartwarming. However, I am very disappointed at the racist content. When expressing her fears about her son's love interest, the mom includes ""What if she is Black? That's all I need..."" in her rant. In addition, her household help is African-American. The comment and portraying the household help as African-American added nothing to the story, but instead tainted a story about homophobia by adding a racist element. Newsflash - there are Ethiopian, Ugandan and African-American Jews. I have to wonder at the lack of sensitivity on the part of the creators of this film who unnecessarily added insult for Blacks to a story about injury caused to Gay men.",1417132800,,706,5.042735042735043

This movie is awesome!  Great actors and actresses, all living up to their abilities.  Good story.  It has a heartwarming ending, but throughout the film they don't mince words and they don't gloss over tough issues while addressing complex family relationships.  At the same time, it's also extremely funny.  I think it's a good way for those who know very little about LGBT issues to dip their toe, so to speak, and to learn a little bit about the social pressures the community faces.  It's not a lecture by any means.  It's a genuine comedy, which just happens to portray a pretty realistic family conflict in a way that allows us to laugh about it. It talks about gayness and intimacy in an open, family-friendly way, without being graphic.  It's not super deep-thinking or comprehensive about every problem a gay person might face, but it is a comedy after all. You'll probably enjoy this movie if you like family comedies.",1416873600,3,1045,4.793296089385475

6339601,3,B00J925RX0,"I ordered the film because I had seen some of interviews and videos about it online.  I was also curious to see how JLY handled his first film performance post Jersey Boys.  In the press conference, Jai Rodriguez tells the story of how the director got him and JLY to do a pivotal scene in a park.  It sounded horrifying and hysterical at the same time.  JLY commented that he thought it is one of the best scenes in the film.  I thought it was THE best scene in the film.  Every time the film cut away from the gay couple, I wanted it to shift back to them.  Lainie Kazan and Saul Rubinek were great and probably very true-to-life as the Jewish parents, but, it was a little too much about them.  I would have liked there to have been a scene or two with Jai Rodriguez film parents, as a comparison.  They already knew and accepted their son's lifestyle, and probably already knew Nelson fairly well.  I thought the guys pulled off the young gay couple in love, especially with one of them still in the closet.  Loved the montage with Jai's character Angelo gleefully trying to find something to wear to the wedding, while JLY's Nelson cringes with every outfit.  They were sweet and not over the top.  There just wasn't enough of them in the film.  Some reviewers commented that JLY seemed uncomfortable playing a gay character.  I think that was the point - Nelson wasn't in a comfortable place.  He was a conservative, Jewish boy who wasn't out and JLY's performance shifted totally in the dinner scene when he tried to make the parents understand. Another scene I liked was when Nelson and his father went to the bar and watched football together. That ended in a sweet moment. I actually liked the animated beginning and thought the humor, although cliched, was pretty funny.  I agree that the ending seemed a little rushed, and I guess are supposed to assume what happened in the last scene.  Overall, I thought it was cute and not too pushy with the message.",1408752000,3,1966,4.505649717514125

What's different about this film is that it's more about the neurotic parents' attempts to accept their gay son than it is about the son and his partner, who are fairly well adjusted. It stars Lainie Kazan (O.k., since Shelley is dead, what other Jewish mother is there?) and Saul Rubinek as the shocked parents, John Lloyd Young as the son (the same John Lloyd Young currently playing Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys) Jai Rodriguez as the gay partner, and Vincent Pastore and Shelly Birch as Jai's parents.

6339629,5,B00J925RX0,"I was genuinely surprised at this movie. I thought it was going to be another low star gay movie, especially with that stupid cartoon opening. Thinking briefly that this WAS a cartoon movie, I almost turned it off and went to look for another to watch. Then my mouse passed over the time line and I saw it had human actors. Was it perfect? No. Was it pretty damn good movie to just let your eyes take in the story, yes. Jai Rodriquez was very good in his role as the Italian boyfriend. In fact, with only a couple exceptions, I loved the actors and the acting. I am however sick of see Bruce Valanche pop up in every gay movie lately. He spoiled some of the scenery. I ended the movie with a tear running down my face, not because of some great acting moment, but because of the depiction of how the world COULD be, and how parents COULD be. Some stereotypes prevailed, but I guess that's to be expected, but at least, THIS gay movie ended happy instead of someone dying or HIV or a bullet to the head. I have my own scripts that I'm trying to get made, but I just can't lay my hands on the budget yet. I have scripts that are better, and have won awards. I'd like to bring to the screen my version of the world and how we gays fit. In the end, I laughed out loud at points and only cried for a minute!",1405814400,,1302,4.08984375

Prior to making this movie, he won a Tony for best lead actor in a musical for his role in Jersey Boys on Broadway, along with three other major theater awards the same year.  He also has a golden voice and was the primary singer on a platinum Grammy-award-winning album.  He's garnered immense praise for his lead role in the movie Jersey Boys, and has been mentioned as a possible Golden Globe nominee.

6339634,1,B00J925RX0,"1.  Fail to secure Bette Midler as the female lead and cast Lainie Kazan instead.  Hope desperately no one will notice.
2.  Repeat step 1 for Richard Schiff and cast Saul Rubinek instead.
3.  Cast Carmen Electra in any role.  Try to make the best of your decision by writing an incredibly painful soft-core lesbian themed scene in a bathroom between her and Lainie Kazan and hope the audience is wincing sufficiently to keep them from noticing her acting.
  Optional: Don't tell Carmen Electra the difference between a clawfoot bathtub and a jacuzzi.
4.  Cast Jai Rodriguez from Queer Eye and have him play Thom from Queer Eye.  Discover your mistake but continue to give him on-screen dialogue.
5.  Realize that John Lloyd Young and Jai Rodriguez do make an attractive couple.  Spend most of the movie following Lainie Kazan and Saul Rubinek instead.
6.  Remind the audience that you're dealing with Jews by writing dialogue including the words ""Oy,"" ""Gevalt,"" ""Meshuganah"" and ""Shtup.""
  Optional:  Have a Jewish wedding.  Have one of the rabbis officiating look like he has two dead ferrets attached to the sides of his head.
  Hope the audience thinks these are peyos.
7.  Have a scene in a gay bar where no one can dance.  Have a scene in the bathroom of the gay bar involving a drag queen.
8.  Realize this might not be the film you were hoping it would.  Write a scene involving Carmen Electra kissing an 80 year old man and pretending she's Tawny Kitaen.
9.  Have Vincent Pastore, the only actor with any talent in the cast, pretend he's still Big Pussy but minus the gravitas.

Laney Kazan and Saul Rubinek are pitch perfect as the overly concerned Jewish parents who really do love their son and do everything they can to overcome their internalize homophobia (with lots of wacky hijinks, of course).  Jai Rodriguez and John Lloyd Young are so adorable as the central couple navigating coming out to their respective parents and building a family together.  However, be warned, there are some very cheesy moments in the movie, but those moments do not overwhelm the heart and soul of this movie.

Jai Rodriguez is a geat actor in other parts, but, my only complaint, which will not endear me to some, is WHY do they have to put 1 straighty acting gay guy with 1 semi to mostly flamboyant gay guy that has to throw temper tantrums to get their way. Now, I do know that many Jewish gay guys like hispanics, but surely there were other hispanic actors to choose from. Sorry, it was just a problem I had with the stress level. It's hard enough to introduce your gay boyfriend to your mother, but it's harder when the guy is on fire.

Once I decided that the boyfriend was actually someone like maybe Charlie David, I enjoyed the movie. But as I said, I love Jai in other movies, just not in this one.",1510790400,,836,4.21875
