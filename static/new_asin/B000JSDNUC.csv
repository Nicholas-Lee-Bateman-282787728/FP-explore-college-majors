8152754,4,B000JSDNUC,I bought this as part of a bet with one of my roommates which required him to do this workout every day for 30 days.  It looks very easy and silly but I can attest to the fact that it works.  Good way to tone your butt and feel a little silly doing it.,1410566400,,252,3.6481481481481484

8152756,5,B000JSDNUC,"I really like this workout.  The whole workout is 42 minutes (including warm up & stretch), I would say intermediate to advanced.  A resistance band is required; modifications are shown for many of the moves and most of these do not use the band.  I have a few other pilates workouts that use a resistance band, but many of the moves here were new to me.  The music is great - I actually recognized some of it.  This one is fun to do.",1277337600,3,434,4.180722891566265
8152757,2,B000JSDNUC,"I am probably an intermediate level of fitness.  Started with regular standing/wear shoes warmup, then to pilates using band.  Can be done without band (one person does workout without) but it seems a waste to do it without since they have designed the moves around having the band, specifically, for maximum effect.  Like the instructor a lot, recommend her kickboxing workouts.",1266364800,,379,5.180327868852459
8152758,5,B000JSDNUC,"I bought this workout dvd a few years back at a Half Price Books and its a dvd I use all the time!! After only using it twice to three times a wk a lost a jean size after only 2wks!! if your looking to slim down while you tone up your legs, butt and arms this is the dvd for you!!!! This is an amazing workout that is low-impact with great results!! It doesnt completely tire you out so that you can continue to do other exercises after finishing the dvd, but just doing the dvd alone produces amazing results!! I love it, and I'm sure that anyone who purchases it with the intent of slimming down their arms, legs and butt will love it too!!!",1262044800,,643,4.070866141732283
8152759,4,B000JSDNUC,"NOTE:  This DVD is apparently a re-release of footage from Janis's Brand New Butt Plus Pilates video; it contains the Warm-Up, Sculpting, and Cool-Down segments only (no Pilates or step aerobics as on the original).  Janis works out with three background exercisers on the same set as her Hardcore Kickbox Circuit.

This is a mainly lower body-focused sculpting workout that uses dumbbells and a Dynaband, and it clocks in just over a half hour.  The 5-minute warm-up is fairly traditional with side taps, hamstring curls, arm reaches, etc., and it concludes with lower body stretches.

The 19.5 minute sculpting section begins with an unweighted plie series.  Some of these moves were reminiscent of ballet, where you stand on one leg and lift one toe up, but Janis also includes plie squats and throws in some plyos as well.  The next series uses dumbbells to incorporate some upper body work:  there is a lunge front with a front raise, a knee lift with a bicep curl, and a front kick with a side raise.

Continuing to work both the upper and the lower body, Janis uses both the band and the weights at the same time for squats with overhead press and side leg extensions.  The final series begins with an upper body combination only (a row/flye on one side, a row/triceps kickback on the other), then adds a back kick with balance and a back leg raise.  Finally, Janis finishes off each leg with lunge front-side-back series.

Janis incorporates the band into the lengthy (just under 7 minutes) cool-down as well, using it mainly to stretch the hips and hamstrings in a lying position.  The cool-down also includes several Pilates moves, such as the teaser and the mermaid (in fact, it's a little odd because Janis keeps talking about the Pilates workout you just completed--which of course isn't included on this version of the DVD).

Overall, I liked this DVD.  It didn't give me a killer lower body workout, but it would be a nice alternative on a shorter/lighter day; I could also see using it as an add-on to a full-body strength workout to get some extra leg work in.  This workout would be most likely to appeal to those who prefer to work their lower body use either no or light weights only.",1216166400,3,2204,4.685714285714286
8152760,1,B000JSDNUC,"I bought Janis' Brand New Butt and More video and loved it, so I thought I'd pick this one up too. Huge mistake! Not only is the video super short, extremely grainy and blurry, but both the warm up and cool down are from the Brant New Butt and More video! Literally HALF of this is a copy-and-paste from another workout video, which is ridiculous. And the main part of the video is super easy and really didn't do anything for me. I like her other videos, so I don't know why she decided to release this debacle.",1171324800,10,512,4.23469387755102
