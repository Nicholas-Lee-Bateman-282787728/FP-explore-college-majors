8157162,5,B000IQH6S0,"This set has some of the episodes that you rarely saw.  If you are only a B&B fan after they got popular, you may not like this DVD set.  If you are an avid fan, then you will enjoy these episodes that were truly lost and forgotten because of their lack of animation quality.  I enjoy this set more than I do the other sets that Time or MTV has offered.  All in all...uuuhhhuhuh...this set rules...mmhmmm...yeah yeah!",1171497600,5,417,4.376623376623376
