The Lucille Ball roast wasn't in Feb. 1975 as the description indicates.  Jack Benny died in Dec. 1974. He was very much alive in the roast.",1525392000,,185,4.138888888888889

8152931,4,B000JSOFAE,"The roast of Dan Haggerty is truly a humdinger.  On more than one occaison I shouted ""hoooo-wee!"" at the zingers being slinged at Haggerty.  A true humdinger of a roast, recommended for all Haggerty nuts.",1392854400,,204,4.8
8152932,2,B000JSOFAE,"Although some material from both roasts is on here, most of it is the Dennis Weaver roast. The majority of it is there but not all. Unfortunately, only about 20 minutes or so of William Conrad's roast is on it. It would have been better if it had been more or less half and half.",1375833600,2,279,4.090909090909091
