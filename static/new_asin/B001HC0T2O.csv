I think you have to be a fan of the Western Mystery Tradition to really get what you want out of these DVDs. I loved Magickal Egypt and added these to my list of must haves. There are lots of youtube trailers for these guys...try before you buy! I LOVED ALL OF THEM!",1287964800,3,402,4.10126582278481
