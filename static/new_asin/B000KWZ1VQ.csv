8159205,1,B000KWZ1VQ,"The english dub was horribly done, of course it was in english so you had the horrible voice actors, so many lost in translation areas, story editing and changing. Making it an almost different show from the japanese version. If you do watch this i would advise watching the japanese version elsewhere so you can compare for yourself. I wasted my money on this product seeing as i am an old sonic fan used to collect the old archie comics. The older sonic the hedgehog series is alot better to buy if you want a good story. Because sadly i think someone edited the show without knowing what they were doing. Thanks 4kids for making me want to break things!",1210204800,4,656,4.475
8159206,5,B000KWZ1VQ,"I play the games of Sonic a lot. He is cool. I wonder why Tails was SO sad that Cosmo left. Was he in love??? I wonder why the show ended eairly? New characters were added to the games, so why did the show have to end? I wanted to see Jet, Wave, Storm, Blaze and Silver in the show. Can't wait to get this DVD.",1204675200,,310,3.712121212121212
8159207,5,B000KWZ1VQ,"The final Sonic X season is in this DVD and I don't know how the SONIC TEAM could make the season any better!! I loved it! Cosmo the new arrival and best freinds with Sonic and the gang dies at the last epostote!! I know Tails was sad at the end but Sonic finds a cosmo seed and at the very end it grows into a sprot! Chris leavs in Eggman's ship and reterns home. SONIC X WAS THE BEST SHOW, AND STILL IS!!!! S-O-N-I-C-GO!!",1194739200,8,423,3.988235294117647

8159209,5,B000KWZ1VQ,"This is a great anime, 5 of 5 stars!!! hehe just one thing, there are cuts on this version like scenes, and Im not sure, but I think maybe some episodes are missing if you compare from the original japanese version.",1177459200,2,215,4.2682926829268295
8159210,1,B000KWZ1VQ,"It should be noted that the Amazon description for this product is WRONG. It does NOT contain both English and Japanese audio tracks. No 4Kids DVDs ever do (save for a few rare, uncut releases that were discontinued).

Sonic X may not be one of 4Kids WORST dubbed animes, but it ranks fairly high. Things are edited out for seemingly no reason, even the mildest of violence is cut, Japanese text and references are blanked and not even translated, and entire episodes are re-arranged. Not to mention, plenty of references to the Sonic games are not translated properly.

This ""season"" of episodes 53-78 received some of the worst dubbing treatment of the entire series. These episodes in their original version contained very mild violence coupled with story arcs that were directed to older children around the ages of 9-14. It was still perfectly fine for younger children, but 4Kids decided to cut it to ribbons anyway removing anything in reference to character violence and death, instead re-writing the scripts and piecing together footage to make it seem like nothing ever happened. I do not think children should be exposed to graphic violence, but there was none of that in Sonic X and 4Kids has practically destroyed the entire Sonic X series.

Do not buy this set if you are looking for a high-quality, entertaining product.",1171756800,15,1335,4.924444444444444
8159211,1,B000KWZ1VQ,"If this was dubbed well, I would rate this a 5, I love series 2 of Sonic X, but NOT THIS VERSION.  I'm sorry but this was the worst dubbed 26 episodes of Sonic X ever.  They delete Cosmo and Molly's death, and change Tails' feelings completely showing NO love or romance. Cream, Vector and Sonic's horrid voices or the screechy Rebecca Honig, the painfully annoying and Barney Gumble sounding Carter Cathcart, and the bland, emotionless, and dweeby Jason Anthony Griffith (Though on voice matters, if there was ANY voice that made me stop watching this show ever again in English, it's Rebecca Honig as Cream, gave me a headache listening to it, that is NOT how a kid sounds).  That horrid replacement music.  The original made me cry, but after episode 74, I stopped and just read the edits and such, and what I read about episodes 77 and 78 appalled me, no true anime fan should buy this DVD set, it's an insult to anime, it's an insult to emotions, and it's an insult to Sonic.  download the episodes in Japanese or French if you can find them, it's better then this.  Trust me, I watched the English episodes as well as the Japanese episodes.  Naruto was a good edited dub, this is not.

Some of the edits involve editing out Molly's death, Changing Cosmo's death completely to something else that makes it look like a bad fanfic (and if my friend Jason is reading this, I said BAD Fanfic, NOT JUST fanfic), they also cut out the part where Knuckles was trying to save Zelkova which I felt was an inportant character part  for Knuckles and even the bad guy before he died.  They also changed Tails feelings towards Cosmo to just friendship rather then love, why?  it was some junk on seeds and such, it made no sence and made it sound nasty.  the ONLY episodes I think were dubbed decently were episodes 73 and 74 but they were still badly voiced and the music was still annoying.  And even so, some translations was pathetic, like when Tails attacked Shadow to protect Cosmo, when Shadow struck Tails, instead of Cosmo yelling to Tails by name in fear for his safety, she just said quietly ""he's hurt"" talk about stating the obvious.......  Why does Cosmo's actress have to sound old and emotionless?  in Japanese Cosmo is an 8 year old girl full of emotion, did 4Kids not know that?

Being the Sonic fan and Anime purist I am, I am making a fandub of this show to see if I can make a better, uncut and more in character English version.

I can say this, THIS IS the final release of Sonic X, TMS and 4Kids confermed it to me resently in a email from each.  So maybe with this gone for a bit, things can get back on track for Sonic, and when another company hopefully licences Sonic X, they can make a better english versions with the original music, original story and better voices, especially Sonic's (it doesn't actually have to be Ryan Drummond or Jaleel White, just someone who can fit Sonic's character like those two were able).

So for now I do say SO LONG SONIC!",1169251200,18,2977,4.449355432780847
