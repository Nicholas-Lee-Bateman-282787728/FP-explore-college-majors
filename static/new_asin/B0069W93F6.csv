we grew up with. My 3-6 year olds love them. Will buy another set for my grandaughter.
So positive and great lessons about life.",1353542400,7,199,4.555555555555555
4981138,5,B0069W93F6,I am 21 now but I still remember every song from every movie. My sister and I would play the video tapes over and over again at my grandma's house. I even sing these songs to kids I babysit. This is so good for kids cause it is not just a movie it has songs that they will learn and remember forever. Great for all ages. My favorite was big rock candy mountain. My sisters favorite is sillyville.,1341532800,11,396,4.089743589743589

4981147,5,B0069W93F6,"45 minutes of freedom to do laundry or cook or clean for mommy and 45 minutes of fun educational singing and dancing for my son :)  he has his favorites (sillyville, big rock candy mountain, the train, and king cole) but we have gone through them all at least 4 times.  These are a classic, but they are just as amazing as when I was growing up!  Cannot go wrong with these!  Definitely a wonderful 1st birthday present for any family/child.",1431475200,,441,4.407407407407407
4981148,5,B0069W93F6,My mom ordered these for my niece and of course just like I used to she loves them. I was surprised after all these years that they are still so popular...and expensive. My mom said she was investing for the future so my hopeful kids can enjoy them too. These are great for kids ages 1-6ish just because they are fun to sing along to and be silly. Most parents don't seem to find them irritating so hopefully you won't be driven nuts when your adorable rugrat begs to play a wee sing movie for the 5th time in a row...,1430697600,,518,4.138613861386139
4981149,5,B0069W93F6,"IT WAS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTERS 1ST BIRTHDAY.  MY DAUGHTER GREW UP WATCHING WEE SING AND WE BOTH THOUGHT SHE WOULD LOVE IT.  SHE WOULD WATCH A LITTLE BIT AND DO SOMETHING ELSE.  I THINK SHE IS JUST A LITTLE YOUNG FOR THE WHOLE
MOVIE.  I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE SET.  MY DAUGHTER IS EXPECTING AGAIN AND NOW SHE WILL HAVE A LOT OF YEARS FOR THE CHILDREN TO WATCH.

THANK YOU.

4981157,5,B0069W93F6,"This set is amazing! It is as good as I remember it being when I was little! My favorites are King Cole's Party and Grandpa's Magical Toys! Not only do these movies teach wonderful lessons and songs, but they have plots, like movies and the songs are not sung like by a mob of kids like in ""kidsongs"". They are beautifully on key and nice to listen to, even for nursery rhymes! :)
I recomend these movies for any parent with young children and believe you will enjoy them as much as they do!!",1397001600,4,492,4.24468085106383

I just spoke with my son about them and he began singing one of the songs.  ( 30+ years later)  I could just see him smiling over the phone.
Buy the whole series!  Hours of fun and memories",1513555200,,355,4.147058823529412

8495619,5,B0069W93F6,"This will sound familiar. My daughter (now 24) loved these on VHS back in the day, and so did we. I can't tell you how many times she fell asleep, but the spouse and I kept watching to the end,,,again! My only complaint  -  the company sold and no more were made. What a pity!

I'm so happy I don't have to try to hook up the VHS and find a replacement for Big Rock Candy Mountain. It will be hard to wait for these, but as Proctor says  ""Patience is a virtue!""",1460592000,,461,3.924731182795699
