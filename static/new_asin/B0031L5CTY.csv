4049307,3,B0031L5CTY,It was ok. Plenty of villains & martyrs. The typical story of acquaintances that turn their backs when the chips are down & turn around to be your friend again after u've proven ur innocence:-(),1371513600,,194,4.571428571428571
4049308,4,B0031L5CTY,"This is a terrific DVD telenovela.  I did not see the prime time original, but the editors did such a good job that I had no trouble following the plot lines and enjoying the acting performances.  Ana Brenda Contreras and Jose Ron are terrific, both individually and as a couple.  Special compliments to the drop-dead gorgeous, impossibly beautiful Patricia Navidad, who is masterful in her role as an honorable, hard-working Mama trying to keep her family together (did I mention how beautiful she is?). One of the best DVD telenovelas I've seen; highly recommended.",1327104000,12,567,5.01063829787234
4049309,5,B0031L5CTY,"Ordene esta Telenovela en Dvd porque no tube la oportunidad de verla en forma completa cuando se transmitio en Television, tambien porque un Amigo me la recomendo y porque tiene un Elenco de Actores que me gusta, por ejemplo, los Protagonistas, Ana Brenda Contreras y Jose Ron.
Soy Fan de Marcelo Cordoba, y en en esta Novela hizo un buen Papel Antagonico como Villano.
Me Encanta la Cancion de David Bisbal, el Tema Principal de la Telenovela, Juro que Te Amo.
Espero que el Dvd Contenga un Buen Resumen de los Capitulos, segun vi en el Aviso de Amazon.com dice que el Dvd trae 4 Discos pero en realidad son 3, pese a eso vale la pena y lo Compre igual, ademas lo quiero para Mi Coleccion.
En cuanto lo tenga y vea, les cuento que tal esta...
8/6/2011: El Dvd es exactamente como pense, la Portada, el Diseo, los Discos, todo...
Tiene una Duracion de 725 Minutos, 12 Horas y 5 Minutos con Lo Mejor de la Telenovela, pese a que en la Tapa de Adelante dice que son Mas de 8 Hs.
Atras, en la Contratapa dice el Tiempo Exacto que dura, el Resumen Esta Muy Bueno, Muy Recomendable!!!
El unico inconveniente que tube fue que al reproducirlo en la Computadora, el Dvd 2 y 3 se activan los Subtitulos Automaticamente y no me deja ver los Dvds Sin Subtitulos, no se porque...
Me Encanto el Dvd de Juro que Te Amo, es Exelente, Contiene un Muy Buen Resumen, realmente Estoy Muy Satisfecho, Muy Contento con la Edicion.
La Telenovela es Hermosa, en todo sentido, Vale la Pena Coleccionarla!!!",1305849600,2,1482,4.472324723247232

4049312,5,B0031L5CTY,"First of all, this dvd does not have 4 discs. It only has 3. Even though there are only 3 dics, its still a great product because each disc last over 4 hours each. Also the opening credits have the original music as well as the score/music during the novela. Of coarse a lot of things are deleted but the important information are there. Overall great product and the things thats good is that it still has its soundtrack in the novela. Buy it!",1271203200,17,444,4.2976190476190474

4049322,5,B0031L5CTY,This was a great watch. I used to try and watch it when I was first learning Spanish and could not understand it all. I decided to grab this DVD a few years later. Includes subtitles and divided into chapters. Great story.,1376352000,3,222,4.309523809523809
4049323,3,B0031L5CTY,"Juro que te amo (I Swear I Love You - 830 minutes)

I love that they use Mozart in key dramatic moments!

Rape figures prominently again, plus old quarrels and rivalries. We start with one of the principals dead and his familia has to cope with penury and possible bankruptcy.

I love the younger villain; he's a crop duster...yum! He's played by a familiar handsome face and is charming and ripped despite his craven and despicable character. (The older villain isn't bad, either!)

Our heroine is lovely, nave, talented and honorable. Her gorgeous widowed mother has been raped by the ultimate villain but they don't want to tell because of possible scandal in their little village.

Our hero is a sunny open-faced guy who simply adores our heroine from the get-go. He knows he is gullible so is wary enough to be savvy. (Does that make any sense?)

I'm happy this is available but I saw this on a set of DVDs from the library. Has Amazon fixed the missing DVD problem yet?",1372982400,,975,4.606936416184971

8387079,5,B0031L5CTY,"Although this series was slow moving in the beginning, it turned out to be quite interesting.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had all the trappings of most telenovelas: suspense, drama, love, hate, jealousy, deceit, treachery, greed, and of course murder.  It's my belief that it would still be exceptional without that last element (murder).  ""I Swear That I Love You"" is a must see Spanish Soap Opera.",1439769600,2,400,4.940298507462686
