1385082,4,B00005094M,Fatal Fury I love the series Including the Movie! I just wish they continued it more! Japan had 20 Eposides! We American's always get to miss the good part's!

1385083,5,B00005094M,"Two of the best action specials on one DVD- how about that? Of course there's the dual language option, and also a character sketch portfolio. One thing about the subtitles is that they're not very accurate. If you know any Japanese at all, you'll notice that the subtitles are kinda different from what is being said. But, that's a small qualm since the original story is intact, so if you enjoyed the VHS tapes, definitely grab a copy of the DVD.",992908800,6,448,4.54320987654321
1385094,3,B00005094M,"As much I enjoy a good anime movie and show. This review is my personal thought.

I give this movie a 3 of five. Mainly for a good effort. I really enjoy playing the game when it came out. And though of a movie about the game sounded great too. One of those good ideas that went somewhere eles. Preaty much streight forward movie. Simple and good. I did not like the ending of this movie. Its a let down... Would give this a two star but three for effort and art work... Maybe I being too kind.",1375401600,,494,4.040816326530612
1385095,5,B00005094M,"Love this Movie, great animated movie for its time. Cant wait untill they can remaster it into HD.
I would recommend it if they are fans of Fatal Fury and King of Fighters. Great Movie",1364947200,,184,4.285714285714286
1385096,5,B00005094M,"This is a solid double feature. For me it's a classic because it definitely helped burrow a spot deep in my heart for anime. The animation is great and fluid, especially during the fight scenes. Unfortunately this DVD is not remastered so the picture quality isn't what we're use to these days. Still, if you're a fan then it's a must have. Especially if you grew up playing the game like I did. Enjoy.",1309910400,,402,4.445945945945946
1385097,5,B00005094M,I have been looking everywhere for this movie and i finally found it on amazon. wooo! thanks for those who were selling this product! You are the best. And this is the best anime. To watch based from the game.,1304208000,,209,4.25
1385098,5,B00005094M,This is a great dvd it has two great anime movies with good audio & video. Don't buy the cheap Japanese/Chinese edition it is inferior the audio sucks on it.,1192060800,,157,4.266666666666667
1385099,5,B00005094M,Very good price for one dvd with 2 movies. And it is  great 2 movies based on the fatal fury and king of fighters series of fighting games.,1187913600,,139,3.9642857142857144
1385100,4,B00005094M,I enjoy anime where people fight in Giant Robots or fight with super powers. Fatal Fury Double Impact satifies the latter in a major way.,1154304000,,137,4.52
1385101,3,B00005094M,I like the video arcade games better then this second movie. Capcom needs some work.,1118448000,,84,4.666666666666667
1385102,4,B00005094M,"The first Fatal Fury was very cheesy and the animation was off.  It did not hold true to the characters in terms of looks and character (except Terry, of course).
Now, the second Fatal Fury was downright awesome.  Terry, Tony, Andy, and Joe all are developed so beautifully and in such a great plot.  I don't know who they got to do Krauser's character, but by gone, they did an excellent job.  I love it that he was not so easily beat; it demonstrated how powerful he really was ('cause he was such a cheater in the game!)
If you can find the second one on DVD by itself, go ahead and get it; it is my personal opinion that the first one is not worth the money because of how poorly it its developed.",1087257600,2,701,4.17037037037037
1385103,5,B00005094M,"FATAL FURY

The Fatal Fury franchise is full of promises and this first animated feature takes the characters beyond the video game boundaries. It's cool how the fighters (Terry Bogard especially) are written as being normal and sensitive rather than always butch, evil and trying to start a fight. The characters in the Street Fighter series were too much like this but Terry Bogard always appears innocent and his adult form still looks like the child he was at the beginning.

But my fave character in Fatal Fury was always Geese Howard. He is such a cool bad guy and live action bad guys should be more like him. Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi are amusing supporting characters and make great sidekicks for Terry.

The ending is a little too quick but when you consider that there is a follow up and a great animated movie it ain't so bad. If you like this one then the others should give you a good fix.

FATAL FURY 2

Not a revolutionary animated movie by any means but this sequel to Fatal Fury has a reasonably good story and interesting characters. The color scheme is bright and easy on the eye and the animation style is better than most Japanese anime in which everyone looks like Asian/American to appeal to both audiences.

I thought that Krauser was a cool bad guy and, for once, one that I doubted the hero (Terry Bogard) couldn't defeat so easily. His costume was a bit excessive and it is hard to believe that he could be so agile under such a suit but one can overlook such a flaw easily.

Terry's brother Andy returns and so does Joe Higashi but it's the 2 new characters that are the best thing about this movie. Kim is a teenage boy who idolizes Terry and considers him to be a real role model. But he is gutted when he discovers that Terry is just a burnt out drunk and will do anything for him until he gets back on his feet. The other new character is Mai and she is a very ""bouncy"" character if you know what I mean.

The fight scenes are very well thought out and vivid. Every punch and kick looks painful and the other heavies look pretty mean too. But we all know that in the end Terry is gonna beat the crap out of them. Just like the video game says...Terry Bogard is the King of Fighters.

But at 68 minutes you feel a little cheated. But with such a short running time there is no room for fat.

The DVD is in 1.33:1 with a nice picture transfer with brilliant colors and the Dolby Stereo soundtracks are adequate but not impressive. Many trailers are available and there are some cool motion menus.",1004054400,12,2529,4.361702127659575
7928795,1,B00005094M,"Shipper provided great service.

Not a fan of going straight to play with no menu option. Defaults to Japanese with English subtitles. When I forced the disc to menu, my only options were language (English and Japanese) and Subtitles (English and Chinese). The key issue is the subtitles - there was no ""off"" option. No matter what, you will watch with subtitles, even if you do not want to. There is a scene selection option, so I can skip the first feature if I choose to, but default playing at the beginning is irritating.
For the English language soundtrack, there is a constant noise that sounds like speaker feedback for the entire double feature. It is not enough to disrupt the movie, but is VERY annoying.
Video quality was good, and other than the feedback noise, sound quality was great as well.

I saw the third feature ""Fatal Fury - The Movie"" first, so I was happy to have the chance to see the backstory. The first movie, ""Legend of the Hungry Wolf"" was ...disappointing. It did a poor job of setting up the romance between Lilly and Terry and developing the characters, though it was not bad seeing it once. I would not feel compelled to watch it again. The second feature was much better, with the same animation and voice actors as ""The Movie."" It was better-written and directed, a much higher quality movie.",1506729600,,1328,4.622881355932203

7928803,5,B00005094M,"This is a great dvd to buy because it has both OVAs in one.
Fatal Fury Legend of the Hungry Wolf & Fatal Fury The New Battle.
If you have never seen this anime then you have been missing out.
This is one of those awesome old school anime (anime before the year 2000)
that had such great stories even though you might have already seen them
in live action movies or other anime during that time.

Fatal Fury is one of those anime that not many people knew or know about but the people
who do know about it know that it is the best.
It comes Complete with an ending ballade for the first OVA & a faster pace fighting spirit ending song for the second OVA.
Great story and awesome action. I don't want to spoil the story for you
but it involves martial arts & revenge, and of course its all done in a fabulous
way by none other than Masami Obari! If you have ever played the Fatal Fury video games
or King of Fighters then you will notice that many of the characters from these games
appear in the anime and even have the same moves. Definitely buy Fatal Fury OVA Double Impact and
then get Fatal Fury the Motion Picture when you are done.

Okay here are the complaints. There is nothing wrong with the anime itself but the quality of
the dvd box and the cover is not a good one. The cover is grainy as if a picture from the internet was
stretched and printed off to be used as the cover. The box was cheap plastic even though that's the usual
case with the boxes this was even less. Also the cover of the dvd itself is also lacking. You might think that these
things do not matter as long as the actually quality of the anime is good but to some people these things do matter
as well.",1375833600,,1682,4.109422492401216
7928804,5,B00005094M,"Loved the video game, but I most say these to movies are awesome.
I'm very glad they made these two and I hear there is a third. I most find it to complete my collection. If its as good as the first 2 then I most own it. Fatal Fury is one of the best Video Game Animes Ever..",1375660800,,275,3.6779661016949152
