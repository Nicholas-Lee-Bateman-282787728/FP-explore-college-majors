7588163,3,B01A1T3R4U,"It was competently acted. The ending was too clichd. I couldn't figure out what the point was of the woman's need to keep killing people. It would seem that a devilish figure was more interested in claiming souls, rather than just killing people. Plot seemed underdeveloped.",1465516800,,274,4.978260869565218
7588164,1,B01A1T3R4U,"This movie, in my opinion, sucks. I don't know why I watched but I did. Don't waste your time. Only watch it if you have nothing to do and I mean nothing to do.",1465257600,,160,3.735294117647059
7588165,1,B01A1T3R4U,"This movie is pretty terrible and makes no damn sense. I gave up after 20 minutes and applaud anyone that can watch the whole thing. Seriously, give those people a medal for surviving this movie.",1465084800,,195,4.6
7588166,2,B01A1T3R4U,"creepy, wife has to kill to get joyful rush..far fetched",1464998400,,56,4.7
7588167,1,B01A1T3R4U,Not good,1464566400,,8,3.5
7588168,2,B01A1T3R4U,"it takes a long road to go next door. The cover and the story are not related, It is very tedious and slow and tends to drag out the obvious. But the girls are very attractive which is it's only redeeming factor.",1462838400,3,212,4.071428571428571

8746409,3,B01A1T3R4U,Fairly good movie. The poster throws you off a little but good otherwise.,1519516800,,73,4.6923076923076925
8746410,5,B01A1T3R4U,Originally I was just looking for trash horror which is something I do and just watch all the horror movies but not pay attention but I actually replayed this one and paid attention because it was actually kinda interesting. I actually really liked the plot and the intrigue. The film quality was low though I wish they'd redo it with more production value.,1511308800,,357,4.682539682539683
8746411,4,B01A1T3R4U,Well done film.,1485388800,,15,4.333333333333333

8746413,1,B01A1T3R4U,"This movie is unrated because it would be rated ""G"" and you wouldn't buy it. I'm not kidding! I am a big B movie fan. I've watched thousands and this is the worst! The acting is awful. The story is awful. There is zero gore and zero nudity. This is a textbook reason why you don't judge a movie by it's cover.",1479772800,3,309,4.0
8746414,1,B01A1T3R4U,The only demon in this movie was one of disappointment.,1475712000,,55,4.6

8746417,1,B01A1T3R4U,"Poor camera work, stereotypical characters to the point of being cliche, terrible writing and acting. This is a C movie at best.",1469404800,,128,4.863636363636363
