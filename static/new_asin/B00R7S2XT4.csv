6901777,4,B00R7S2XT4,"Really good concert bluray.  The sound quality is very good, but not as dynamic as some others that I own.  However, overall a good concert and recommended for ELO fans.",1435881600,,169,4.6
6901778,5,B00R7S2XT4,"I have seen this concert through Netflix both on DVD and through their streaming service, but I've got to say, nothing compares to the Blu-Ray quality sound and image, which advertises it as an SD Blu Ray, which is fine as the quality of the images are as clear as day, but it's the sound that means so much more to the fans, and the sound quality is where it is at.

On top of the Blu Ray capabilities, the thing that sold me on buying this Blu-Ray was the advertisement of over 3 hours of concert footage and a small interview to really let you into the band. I noticed that Kelly Groucutt, bassist for the band is actually Mike Albuquerque in the German concert in 1974.

Flaws are few, and with the great music, I will say fans should check this out.

Also, quick note to people who are skeptical of whether or not this will work on your player (for the record, I viewed by copy on a PlayStation 3 game console, which aren't equipped with Region free players) and this works just fine. The back of the case indicated the Blu-Ray has an ""E""  meaning ""exempt from classification"", whether that means they cannot put a rating akin to the MPAA or that it will work on any Region player, I'm not sure, but I have my U.S. PlayStation 3 running the experience with no issues.

If you are a fan, you owe it to yourself to own this. It's a lot of fun, great tunes and an experience that will be hard to replicate until Mr Jeff Lynne gets to that 2015 U.S. tour he's thinking of going on (fingers crossed!)

6901781,5,B00R7S2XT4,"I already had this concert on DVD but I noticed there were lots of extra shows on the Blu-Ray.  The amazing thing about this Blu-Ray is that all of the Bonus Concert Footage from 73,74, and 76 have better sound and picture quality than the Main Show which is the Out of the Blue show at Wembley..  The OUT OF THE BLUE show is great but the sound just isn't quite as clear as the Bonus Content and that is very unusual...  The Bonus Concert at FUSION is a FULL SHOW and it is AMAZING.  The Fusion show has Classics like ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head"",  ""Strange Magic"", ""Poker"", ""Nightrider"", and ""Evil Woman, all which were not on the main Wembley Show.  Also it has Videos for 8 of the 9 songs from DISCOVERY.... A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ELO FAN!!!!!!!",1432857600,25,747,4.188811188811189

6901783,5,B00R7S2XT4,"Quite impressive! Picture quality is top notch for such ""old"" footage, the sound quality is excellent and the bonus features are just huge. This sets the standard for other groups!
This is really FIVE CONCERTS on one disc, the other footage is also remastered with top quality and great sound. The Rockpalast concert is my favorite, much much better quality than the bootleg stuff you'll find on YouTube.",1478995200,,404,4.955882352941177
6901784,3,B00R7S2XT4,"Realizing this material is from the Stone Age of rock  well maybe the Bronze Age, coupled with comments from other reviewers and the SD  Blu-Ray label which is almost an oxymoron despite the definition, I expected the content to be of a lesser quality than that produced more recently.  Even with this expectation I was still disappointed in both the audio and video quality of the main material.
While rendered in DTS Master Audio, the audio is IMHO just plain poor. Outside of a modest bass boost and ambient crowd noise the DTS-MA rendering provides little.  To me its almost bootleg quality.  The 4:3 (Bronze Age standard) video quality is also poor as if almost a direct VHS to Blu-Ray transfer with even the cheesy 70s-esque vignetting, wipes and fades. With all the tools available today to restore and enhance video, I hoped for better quality.  Ive seen other concerts from this time period and even earlier, that look and sound much better.  My thought is that the producers of this release knew of the sub-par A/V quality of the main concert and instead of working to bring up the quality, tried to make up for it by including a large quantity of additional material as a consolation.
From an AV perspective this disc will likely sit on my shelf.  Im glad I didn't pay that much for it.  I will have to continue to hold out hope for a good surround treatment of the ELO catalogue someday. (Akin to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road) Hopefully soon as Im not getting any younger!  After all they did put together some surround mixes for the Beatles and their material, while undeniably good is not as lush as that of ELO which, to me, just cries out for a good surround treatment.
That said, I could echo whats been written in other reviews about the additional information, much of which is good to have from a fan perspective.  If you like ELO and don't have this stuff already, this is a nice-to-have collection of this material all on one disc.  If you're buying it to try and relive the magic of an ELO concert in their prime, this won't really take you there, unless you have low expectations and a vivid imagination.",1477008000,3,2125,4.577836411609499

6901786,5,B00R7S2XT4,"This blu-ray is incredible.  It has several concerts from the 1970s.

6901791,1,B00R7S2XT4,"I got this for the Electric Light Orchestra-Don't Bring Me Down music video, because I collect music videos. This video is incomplete on this complete trash product produced by Eagle Vision, which couldn't produce a quality product if it tried. The entire music industry wants you to believe that music videos don't sell well. What they won't EVER tell you is that they have a consistent track record of producing terrible quality products when it comes to music video products, and that's the number #1 reason they don't sell well! Instead of having the actual end of the Don't Bring Me Down music video they roll the closing credits to what I can only assume is the closing credits of some Discovery laserdisc/DVD/VHS instead while the song's audio rolls. It may be that the VHS/DVD/laserdisc source they used (it came out on all three of these formats according to Wikipedia and discogs) to make this version also did this. I can't say for sure since I have never seen the laserdisc or VHS versions, and I also don't know what it was sourced from. But if it did, it only goes to prove my point even further, because Eagle vision, or someone else, produced yet another junk product, and they just copied it, rather than getting the master recording of the music video from the music label that holds the rights to it and including the full video like they should have. If I could give this product 0 stars I would, shame on you Amazon for NOT giving me that option! This company also produced a DVD version of this, and did the exact same thing on it! You would think they would learn from past mistakes, and strive to make better quality products, to sell more units, and make more money. But either they are too cheap to do that, or they just don't have it in them to make a good product. Unfortunately for the consumer, this is often the case in the junk products they produce to market to us, taking advantage of the fans of music & music videos. Please don't buy this and support bad companies or bad products, it's anti productive, to get a better product you have to not buy the trash products like this one, to force companies to recognize their need to produce better ones! If they can't get with the program, then they need to fail, so a better company will come along and hopefully produce a better product.",1459641600,,2320,4.526190476190476

6901794,5,B00R7S2XT4,"Blu Ray is a great disc.  You get almost everything the dvd had plus much more.

Why the 4 stars?  The last song on this disc is omitted totally although the menu on the disc shows it as being there and so does back of Blu Ray case.  The last song is from ""Discovery"" set of videos and it is the song, ""Don't Bring Me Down"".  Very disappointed since the DVD has it and it is listed but instead of ""Don't Bring Me Down, they added ""On The Run"" which was not on ""Discovery.""  They also switched the order of the songs and put ""On The Run"" after ""Midnight Blue"".  I would not think it would be a licensing issue since this is the group that made it a major hit, but needless to say, I deducted a star for this switch as they tell no one.  I am still ctually thinking of returning it.

EDIT:  I found the song ""Don't Bring Me Down"" in the ""Discovery"" part of disc.  It is after ""Wishing"" as stated but it is not a separate track.  It is on same track as ""Wishing"".  So, anyone else looking for this song, this is where it is.  I will not be returning the disc.

Unlike most music discs, the title and main concert is the low point for me and the extras are the highs.  The ""Out Of The blue"" Concert is good but the camera angles and special effects editing I did not care for.  The sound is not awful as in the dvd but it is not real good either.  It is as if it is more of bootleg caught concert than a professionally made. The video clarity seems cleaned up a little compared to the dvd.  The sad thing is, this is the main concert and for me, had the best song set.

As you go through the disc, the older concerts have much better sound and video quality which is strange as you would think the technology would improve as the years went by, but not here.  I enjoyed the older concerts and looking at where the band was as far as being live on stage compared to the ""Out Of The Blue"" concert.  How much they progressed and how much larger the stage has to be to fit their equipment and such.  The songs they performed in the older sets were great but as others stated, the standouts were both versions of ""Roll Over Beethoven""  In the 1974 Rockpalast show, it was almost like a jam session and they were clearly having a great time.

All and all, this a great disc with the exception of the song switch on 'Discovery' and it does seem to look and sound a bit better than the dvd version.  If nothing else, the added bonus concerts make this disc a worthwhile purchase for most ELO fans.  Now if they would just put ""Zoom"" on a Blu Ray and although the members changed, the sound and concert is probably the best I have seen on disc by ELO.",1452643200,,2638,4.081712062256809

6901799,3,B00R7S2XT4,"The concert in Wembley was OK, but I basically bought this Blu-Ray disc for all the extras.  Most specifically, the earlier concert performances that were originally released separately as ""Electric Light Orchestra Live: The Early Years"" only on DVD.  I bought my copy from the UK because the American release of this DVD did not include two performances of ""Roll Over Beethoven.""  This was my favorite music DVD for over half a year, but then I see this Blu-Ray of ""Out of the Blue-Live at Wembley"" which features all those shows from the Early Years, plus the US release of this Blu-Ray includes the performances of ""Roll Over Beethoven"", so I had to get this.

But, to my surprise, the blu-ray versions of the Early Years just don't look as mastered and tight as my DVD from the UK. What is going on here? So, I guess I should just keep my DVD of the early years because the performances all look mastered better. And, on a smaller TV, 46"", the picture quality is just a little darker.  Maybe that contributes to why the DVD version looks less grainy.

The only extra that actually looks pretty good on this blu-ray is the ""Discovery"" videos from 1979. The part that is the least interesting to me, actually looks the best.  So, I guess I'll just watch my ELO shows on the smaller TV since picture quality is more important to me than the size of the screen.  Because, it always remains to be true, that the smaller the picture, the better the picture is. A bigger screen is likely to reveal all the flaws more, such as the case is here.",1446336000,,1540,4.475

6901802,5,B00R7S2XT4,"It's about freaking time somebody released something on this band that's worthwhile. You figure this is 35 years after the fact and finally there's something worth buying if you're an ELO fan.  Can't add to what any of the other people said, but at 205 minutes this disc includes an awful lot of material for those of us that are real fans of this group.  You get a small '73 and '74 performance that shows you a band that still hasn't quite gelled yet and hasn't quite got their act together.  Watching those 2 performances, you're not sure if they're going to last or not, but you can see the potential if they can bring their sound together.  Those 2 performances are a nice piece of history before the band made it big.  Then you get to the '76 and '78 performances and they kick out the jams and they blow you away.  Sound quality is very good and picture quality is very good, maybe they could be slightly better, but could be why they took so long to put these performances out together on one disc.  The '79 Discovery performance is a nice addition to the disc.  Despite 205 minutes, I find myself wanting more performances and if they're available, I'd love to see them.  If you're a fan, this is a must buy for you because I don't think there's anything out there that's comparable.  The '76 and '78 versions of Rollover Beethoven are a definite necessity, which were missing on the DVD release.  They are both fantastic.  The only other disc I know of to purchase is the 2014 Bluray Hyde Park release, which I'm thinking of picking up, but haven't seen yet with the reforming of the original band.  Although I didn't see Bev's name mentioned in there.  You won't be dissatisfied, you have to have this if you're an ELO fan. Pick it up & enjoy.",1445644800,2,1754,4.423676012461059

The original bonus feature on the Wembley DVD was the Discovery TV special, featuring the band miming to the entire Discovery album in the studio, in what constituted the last ELO-related appearance of cellists Melvyn Gale and Hugh McDowell (who did not play on the album, same as violinist Mik Kaminski), and it is present here in very crisp quality.

Also, all contents from the DVD The Early Years (recordings from Brunel University 1973, German TV 1974 and The Vic Theater in London 1976) are replicated as bonus features, and restoring Roll Over Beethoven and Day Tripper, mistakenly omitted from the US DVD edition.

8694443,3,B00R7S2XT4,"This is good. The video is quite good and the audio is good.
The main concert is very good. Elo were always a good band. Be aware, especially some of you younger folks, in the seventies camera men/producers had learned some tricks. These tricks have not aged well. Multiple shots sliding around The screen on top of each other. The wiggly shot change etc etc .... These video tricks are the equivalent of the seizure inducing shot changes used these days. For some reason video producers and editors seem to think some excitement needs to be added. So while you just want to see The band they try to stamp their wizardry all over the screen to dazzle you. It ever fails to irritate.
The bonus features are good.
My disappointment stems from the discovery video/album. My main reason for getting this was that section of the bonus features.
It is not that it is bad, it just doesn't really make sense. I had the original dvd they released, and it was awful, so I got rid of it. I knew that it was only 8 of the 9 tracks from the original album, so I figured with all the blurb about 5.1 master audio etc, that they had remixed the album, and the missing track was due to the multitracks not being available for it. It is just in stereo, so the missing track makes no sense. It is a lot better quality than that original release, but it just doesn't make sense to leave a track off for no reason. If it had been redone in 5.1, I would probably give this 4 to 4.5 stars instead of 3 to 3.5.",1482710400,,1487,4.257950530035336
