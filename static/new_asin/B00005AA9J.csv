Reminds me what would happen if South Park took over VH1's behind the music.  The only problem I noticed with this DVD is after about 20 minutes it gets boring.  This DVD is best taken in small doses.

It consists of about 12 - 5 or less minute segments on various rock bands. Most are funny and completely trashed the bands we love.  Unfortunately watching these back to back just does not work.  Even when Beavis and Butthead aired, they needed to take a break between episodes to show something slightly different, and unfortunately this show suffers from the same fate.  Hence why this DVD only gets 3 stars.",1297209600,,737,4.488721804511278

The ""victims"" here are some of the WORST mega-popular acts in recent memory; from the obnoxious [...] rappers Kid Rock & Limp Bizkit (or however you spell that stupid name) to the pretentious, screeching noise made by Bald Billy & his Smashing Pumpkins (now mercifully disbanded) and Garbage (an appropriate moniker, indeed), they all get the stuffing beat out of them for their collective worthlessness. Great tape to play at a party; just hope no one actually likes any of these. Even if they do, they just might change their mind after seeing this video. After all, how much of that screeching caterwauling from Billy Pumpkin can anyone take?",996105600,2,739,4.826771653543307
