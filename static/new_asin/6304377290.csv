852272,2,6304377290,"Visual quality of this video is fair to average. The sound track is good.  This is a 54 minute cut version of this title.  The original theatrical release had a running time of approximately 75 minutes.  Uncut versions of  this film can be found in private film collections, but none are known to  be available on home video.  This 1944 release is one of the first 3 films  Roy starred in with Dale Evans.  It is too bad that this title is not  available on video in its original full length form, as this is one of the  better Roy Rogers films.",950054400,6,545,4.254901960784314

It begins at the Club Casanova in a big city. A couple dances. Miss Joan Farrelly sings for the audience. There is a fight. Throw him out! Jennys father questions her fiancee, then leaves for Nevada. The DC-3 airplane lands for emergency repairs. John asks some cowboys for a plate of beans for a meal. A cowboy is thrown and dragged! Roy rescues him. The cook tries to relay a message, but the rich man missed his flight. There is a song at a Medicine Show (a hidden record player). John Barrabee recognizes his horses, they were sold. That missed plan crashed, Barrabee is believed dead! His daughter sold his ranch. [A legal problem in recovery?] John wants Roy to become Jennys new boyfriend. Jenny dismisses the hired help. [Note how these cowboys are unarmed.] Roy goes to meet Jenny and shows her his contract. Roy will drive a stagecoach in a race. The rain forces a detour to the fishing shack. They will have a picnic there.

Roy suggests fishing after lunch. Then he sings with Jenny. Roy drives their stagecoach into town, and sleeps in it to guard it. A man sneaks in at night and does something to a stagecoach. The next day there is a song by an Indian princess. The race begins, six horses draw each coach. One stagecoach takes the lead, but an accident stops it! The Barrabee coach wins! There is a feast at night. Girls dance (a variation of the Can-Can?) There is a song about Jane, who visited New York city. Colonel Jack complains about the sabotage to his coach; he blames Roy! Planted evidence! Pettigrew drops by, he bought the ranch from Barrabee before John died (he says). This stops the sale of the ranch, and Rollo Bingham drops Jenny. [She is no longer wealthy.] Roy returns to tell Jenny the shocking news! Roy races to the fishing shack, but Ferguson arrived first with a gun. Roy arrives to save John. Ferguson confesses to the coach sabotage. There will be a celebration that night, with a song. Dancing girls perform. A man twirls a lasso while dancing.

This is a good story about how a family ranch is saved and a fortune hunter is rejected. It has an almost complete absence of gunplay, unusual for a Western of that era.",1467763200,,2186,4.529113924050633

7868934,5,6304377290,"I'm watching the movie on TV right now.  It's one of Roy & Dale's movies I've never seen before, but I've already decided I simply must have a copy of this movie, and thank goodness Amazon has the movie for sale.  I'm getting a copy as soon as possible.  I only have one complaint, and that's that I wish someone would take these old movies and clean them up, sharpen the pictures and see what could be done to improve the sound.  It might not be possible to get them back to movie theater quality, like when they were first shown, but it would be nice if someone would try.  I'm not a purist I guess, as I would not mind seeing a colorized version of this movie either.

As for the movie itself, it has a wonderful mix of classic western songs and ones written just for this movie.  The plot is believable and the acting is up to Roy & Dale's usual high standard. Believe me, you won't be disappointed if you add this 1944 gem to your movie collection.",1366070400,,953,4.2032967032967035
