7028236,1,B00U2YNN6W,"Horrific acting, stunted, forced, and asinine dialogue, and a story that just doesn't come together...

Nah, I wish I had skipped this one. You should.",1437609600,,151,5.04
7028237,5,B00U2YNN6W,One of the smartest indie films I've seen. If you are into crime thrillers I think you will dig this as well. I'm not familiar with the true story but will have to seek it out. Great acting and shot well. The score was excellent too. Definitely worth a watch IMO.,1437350400,3,263,4.176470588235294
7028238,1,B00U2YNN6W,"It might have been based on a true story & it could have been a good movie but again i found myself turning another awful movie off (which i normally don't do) because it was boring me to sleep & the low budget & terrible acting didn't help. I suppose a lot of people gave it good reviews because the girl got naked,i don't know...unless something extraordinary happened in the last 45 minutes that i missed. But it wouldnt have mattered if i had tried to watch it. I couldn't stay awake.",1437264000,2,488,4.315217391304348

7028241,1,B00U2YNN6W,"I normally do not write movie reviews but this one deserved my time because I felt it was my duty to warn people to save your money and do not waste your time on this one!!! While I am quite aware that everyone has their own taste and opinions, I consider myself to be pretty ""open minded"" when it comes to horror flicks and have seen hundreds of them in my lifetime. I've seen many that others have rated poorly that I liked a lot so it's not that I am extremely picky. I just like a good story with at least halfway decent acting to hold my interest. The only thing that kept me from turning this one off 5 minutes into it, is because I paid for it so at least wanted to see it through to give it a fair shot. It did not get better. For the people who said it had ""good acting"", that had to be sarcasm because this was the worst acting I have seen in a very long time! Any high school drama class could have done a better job than that! It was embarrassingly pathetic! If this was based on a true story, they did not do it justice at all. The beginning, the middle and what there was of an ending (what the hell was THAT about???) was a hot mess as far as I'm concerned. Nothing made much sense to me. Anyway, there it is. An honest opinion from a true horror movie fan. This one sucked big time!",1436486400,6,1298,3.996153846153846
7028242,5,B00U2YNN6W,From the chilling opening scene you will be hooked by the dark situations and earnest performances.,1436313600,2,99,5.25
7028243,5,B00U2YNN6W,"Fantastic acting, very atmospheric and the story moves with you. Lots of twists that leave you wanting more.",1436313600,,108,5.055555555555555
7028244,3,B00U2YNN6W,"Two young women go hiking in the Appalacian mountains, but someone is watching. One is murdered, the other escapes and is sighted by a man with binoculars, as she walks in a state of trauma along a railroad. She is in intensive care at a hospital in a small town, where the local sheriff is determined to bring the killer to justice. I was really interested as the sheriff searches for clues, and clues there are, which really held my interest.  However, a young African American shows up who is a friend of one of the girls and then we get the usual bigotry. This movie really fell apart with predictable plotting, and poor acting. It's up to you if you want to watch it.",1436054400,7,672,4.376
7028245,5,B00U2YNN6W,Great flick- for not having much of a budget they did a great job of telling a story that loosely follows a set of true events that occurred near the same location in which the film was shot. The plot is solid and the acting is well done. Definitely worth checking it out!,1435104000,8,272,4.150943396226415
7028266,1,B00U2YNN6W,It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The acting(if you can call it that) was horrible.  The dialog was incredibly trite.  The only good part of the movie was the music playing in the background!,1440633600,,206,4.230769230769231

7028270,1,B00U2YNN6W,"Worst. Movie. EVER. Bad acting, slow and drawn out, bad sound quality, awful, awful. I am really mad I spent almost $13 to see this garbage. I love Indie films but this one? Ridiculously bad. Save yourself the cash and brain cells, don't bother even if free.",1437868800,,258,4.51063829787234
7028271,5,B00U2YNN6W,"This low-budget movie met and exceeded my expectations.  It is not a traditional horror movie, as it seems some tried to see it as. It is more a psychological story based on real incidents. I thought the acting was, for the most part, good...natural sounding conversations. Obviously not academy awards quality, but they were not going for that.  They were telling a story, and a very good story. There was some nudity, but it was definitely not gratuitous, but because of the context, it was uncomfortable. And that, to me, was what it was supposed to be. The sheriff was believable, and the ranger was very good. His attempt at humor in an uncomfortable situation played well with the serious sheriff. The killer was low-keyed, but effective. As were the women. Both lead women did a great job with uncomfortable subject matter. Another element of this movie I found very good was the soundtrack. It plays well with this movie.
If you want a John Carpenter film, this is not it. But if you want a good, independent psychological movie, give this a try! You won't regret it.",1437782400,3,1075,4.712765957446808
7028272,4,B00U2YNN6W,"Imaginative, Appalachian trail story/camping horror story with lots of anticipation and suspense. I like movies more sewn up in the end, so that's the only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5. It left me with so many questions. I wanted to know more, but I think that's a trend now, and I know it leaves more up for interpretation by the viewer the way a good story should. I can appreciate a great indie film when I see it, and I recommend this film. Give it a shot! High on imagination and creativity, and I hope to see more from this team.",1437696000,5,547,4.219047619047619
7028273,5,B00U2YNN6W,"I thought it did a good job of holding your interest throughout.  Several of the transitions were creative and while yes you could anticipate the plot (lets be honest when you watch a horror flick you expect people are gonna die), the killer was creepy enough that it made me think twice about walking in the woods alone- especially if I smelled cigarette smoke.",1437696000,4,362,4.65625
7028274,1,B00U2YNN6W,"The acting was unbearable. I know it's low budget, but that doesn't mean everyone in your family gets a part . (I'm guessing here...;) )  The only decent actor was the psycho; however, why he'd have that southern-type accent when they're in Pennsylvania?  I'm more annoyed that I had to _pay_ for this one;  with all the free dreck that Amazon Prime makes available to us, I just assumed that when you paid for a movie the production values would be a little higher. It wasn't even 1.99 -- it was 3.99 Rip off.  My apologies to all the hard-working people on the movie; you have to fail before you succeed.",1437696000,2,606,4.4324324324324325

8704225,3,B00U2YNN6W,This movie highlights one way bad guys pick their prey.  They go after the weak and foolish and the two women seemed to fit that category.  The acting wasn't bad.,1508371200,,162,4.366666666666666

8704228,1,B00U2YNN6W,"This is one of the most boring, ridiculous movies I have ever seen. The actors are horrible and there is no plot and no real ending.  They never even bother going after the killer.

I bought this by accident and couldn't return it. I'm going to delete it because it's not worth watching again.

Save your money",1483142400,3,310,4.4035087719298245

8704233,1,B00U2YNN6W,"If I'm gullible enough to believe the good reviews that are posted for this drivel then I guess I deserve to sit through it without shutting it off, even though it's obvious by the first half hour that the plot's going nowhere.  What's worse is that it's not the first time I've fallen for this gag.  I'm not going to bother critiquing the film; the other negative reviews are right on the money.  All I'll say is that it is bad with a capital B-A-D.  At least now I've learned from my mistake.  Hopefully others will learn by my example.",1440720000,,538,4.34
