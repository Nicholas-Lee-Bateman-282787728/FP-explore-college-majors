4931352,5,B0061SUIFC,"This video is very telling. I sometimes wonder why we pay the FDA salaries. If a dentist is taught in dental school that they can't touch mercury directly or breathe it in preparation of fillings, well how in the world can it make sense that dental patients have their mouths full of it, run hot beverages over it, crush down their foods with it and then if they have the courage to have it removed, they don't have their mouths isolated and noses and eyes covered in the procedure just like the dental professionals do? You have to go to a biological or holistic dentist to get basic safeguards in your removal procedures! What?! Why don't all dentists have to abide by these patient safeguards? I'd have a lot more faith in government if they would deliver on the regulatory safeguards they boast. As it is, it's just shallow promises with little to no protection delivered, much like the pink slime in our kids' school lunches...It's well past time that Americans stopped waiting for other people to watch out for their health. Have a look at ""smoking teeth poison gas"" on youtube. Not as good as this video but well full of information someone with metal fillings should be aware of.",1334361600,3,1187,4.630331753554502
4931353,5,B0061SUIFC,"This documentary is a sobering expose on the use of mercury ""silver"" amalgam filings by the US dentistry.  You'll see how and when it began, the damage it does, how little the FDA does, and how to undo it.  It will make you want to find the nearest mercury-free, biological dentist to have your mercury amalgam fillings removed.",1334016000,3,328,4.637931034482759

8490954,5,B0061SUIFC,"Finally, the ""drama"" part of a comtemporary health exegesis film is tailored, in an appropriate manner, into the thread, very nice job throughout here.  First example I've seen of ""new, improved"" filmmaking. I'd give it an A+ grade, personally.  So many many of these films have the added flavor of ""chemically incuded drama"" -- the chemisty's being worked by ""player piano"" techniques, very often an attempt to show ""Hollywood sensationalism"", faux car crash, almost cataclysmic stuff.  This seems more solidly mindful.  The simpler-but-no-ersatz-pushy-manipulation motif adds a lot of value for the viewer . . .",1410566400,,613,5.421052631578948
8490955,3,B0061SUIFC,"This film followed the same formula as others of the same genre, but to its credit kept moving along, and did not bore the audience to death with ""mercury poisoning"" dogma.  Therefore, it accomplished its purpose by providing layman's information.  However, I feel these films are much more effective when they devote AT LEAST 10% of the script to Medical Doctor level, peer reviewed, pure SCIENCE; patients can THEN present their physicians and dentists with hypothetically plausible evidence and explanation rather than relying solely on anecdotal reports from ""victims"".",1383868800,,573,5.426966292134831

""The story I'm about to tell you began 150 years ago.  Since then it has worked itself into our environment, wildlife, and our bodies.  A silent, hard metal that can run through your veins and attach to your organs, it will poison you little by little, taking your peace of mind away, and in the end, it will kill you.""

The above is said by the narrator at the beginning of this interesting and extremely informative documentary.

The metal this program is talking about is mercury, also known as quicksilver.  Its chemical symbol is Hg.

Mercury is a potent neurotoxin and pollutant linked to such conditions as chronic fatigue, anxiety, allergies, insomnia, irritable, bowel syndrome, learning disabilities, panic attacks, schizophrenia, asthma, and psychosis.

Throughout this program there is narration with comments from experts (professors, dentists, lawyers, environmental specialists, etc.).

The majority of this documentary is concerned with amalgam or ""silver"" fillings used in dentistry.  Such fillings have up to 50% mercury.

We learn such things as the biochemistry of mercury toxicity, hear from some of the victims and survivors of mercury toxicity, how the pharmaceutical industries and dental associations are reacting, the problems with conventional medicine, amalgam removal, detoxification, etc.

The DVD itself (the one released in 2011) has four extras in the form of interviews.  They are all interesting.

The only problem I had with this documentary is that it fails, I felt, to explain certain key points.  For example, amalgam fillings are combined with other materials to make the mercury in them (we are told) harmless and inactive.  (Just like flammable hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water.)  So, how can the mercury in the fillings still cause harm?  Or, we're told about amalgam removal.  Then these amalgams have to be replaced with other material called a composite.  How do we know that this composite material is safe and won't leak?

In conclusion, this is a powerful documentary that will make you think twice before you eat that catch-of-the-day or about your next dental visit!!

8490960,5,B0061SUIFC,"I have had problems with my teeth since I was a child.  The day I was introduced to chocolate was my downfall.  Over the years I've had abscessed teeth, cavities, root canals, bridges, crowns, root planning and extractions.  I have  so much metal in my mouth, I can't get on an airplane with out being wanded by the TSA Gestapo.  It was during my first root canal that I wondered why they were taking the extra precautions of a rubber dam placed around my tooth, an oxygen mask over my nose, an oxygen mask over the dentist and his assistant faces. When everything was done I asked them what all that was for.  They told me the amalgam filling they had to drill out was considered toxic waste. After watching ""Mercury Undercover"", I now understand what they mean by toxic. For the FDA to admit to Amalgam fillings with Mercury to be toxic would be tantamount to the US government admitting to the presence of alien life in the universe. This movie will open a few eyes and a few mouths.",1334620800,4,986,4.419889502762431
