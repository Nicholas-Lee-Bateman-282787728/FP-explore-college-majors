6853632,4,B00Q3AXYCW,"I am a devotee of alpine skiing That made me buy this disc. The quality is first rate. My only reservation is that no strong consistent theme - aside from the dazzling views - drives the pictures. But the still fulfill my old dream of seeing the Alps over all, rather than simply in the views obtainable from ski resorts, and roads and railways.

If budgets ever permit, a map showing where things are, in relation to the usual ports of entry - Milan, Innsbruck,Zurich, Geneva, Albertville - would help some viewers. I believe.",1430611200,3,527,4.6063829787234045
6853633,5,B00Q3AXYCW,"Great camera work, I highly recommend this.",1428624000,,43,5.285714285714286
6853634,5,B00Q3AXYCW,We watched this on Netflix and are buying two copies now for gifts for friends who love the Alps as much as we do.  Gorgeous scenes of some of our favorite places and an inspiration to discover even more about this region.  A beautiful way to spend 90 minutes of your viewing life!,1428364800,,281,4.283018867924528
6853635,5,B00Q3AXYCW,This is breathtaking!  Awesome!  Beyond comprehension because it provides views and aspects that can not possibly be filmed without the special cameras used to produce the film.  It is hoped that the viewer has a large enough flat screen to view this spectacular ride.  You will definitely NOT be disappointed!,1428278400,,310,5.14
6853636,5,B00Q3AXYCW,Breathtaking... I was holding my breath the entire time... worth every penny and more...,1427673600,,88,5.357142857142857

6853640,5,B00Q3AXYCW,"Beautifully filmed, cinematic ""eye candy"" that you hope for when you buy a video like this. Also, such a variety of subjects highlighted that I realized that I did not know as much as I thought about the Alps (despite 5 trips there), and my enthusiasm for learning more was renewed.",1446768000,,282,4.549019607843137
6853641,5,B00Q3AXYCW,"The movie is reasonably priced, but you're going to want to shell out for a plane ticket after watching this.

The movie does an excellent job of capturing the different seasons and settings one can experience in the areas around the alps.

Since there's not really a ""story"" or ""characters"" you could probably re-watch this film a dozen times or more. Turn off the sound and just let it play on the TV as an alternative to something like a Yule Log video if you want a little background imagry for your next ge together -- although on second thought, people will probably stop interacting and just start staring at the majesty.

My only regret is that I don't have this on Blu-Ray or 4K with a 108"" TV.",1443916800,,703,4.434108527131783

6853645,5,B00Q3AXYCW,"Absolutely fantastic video.  We have toured the Alps on a number of occasions, but being able to"" look down upon the Alps From Above"" and having the excellent narration that accompanies the video, offers a totally new perspective.",1431388800,,230,5.052631578947368
6853646,5,B00Q3AXYCW,"Too glorious for words - this is the place where I would like to die, period.  God screams out of every magnificent shot: ""Subdue the earth and conquer it,"" he said.  But don't destroy it.  No wonder the Lucerne Festival can afford such artists - the people who can afford to go there are surely all billionaires!  Don't miss it.",1431302400,,329,4.433333333333334

8690126,1,B00Q3AXYCW,This is the beautiful video but for some reason they made it very disturbing and frightening with things like extreme skiing events and dangerous sports and upsetting images which may not happen in a travel video To the extent that I will not watch it because it is disturbing,1509148800,,276,4.653061224489796
8690127,5,B00Q3AXYCW,This is a lovely travelogue--beautiful pictures of the Alps woven together into a narrative whole.,1501372800,,98,5.6
8690128,3,B00Q3AXYCW,"""A Symphony of Summits"" is a bit misleading; the film spends a good deal of time surveying the human culture of the region at considerably lower altitudes. The voice-over tends toward cliches. The aerial photography is often spectacular. If I could: 3.8 stars.",1500508800,,260,5.069767441860465
8690129,5,B00Q3AXYCW,Best geographic documentary I've ever seen. Watching it is like being on vacation on the edge of your seat.,1488585600,,107,4.684210526315789
