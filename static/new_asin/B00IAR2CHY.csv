6255683,5,B00IAR2CHY,this guy must be a great teacher he is both knowledgeable and enthusiastic I recommend the film for every thinking person,1397433600,,121,4.809523809523809
6255684,4,B00IAR2CHY,"I'm sorry.. I watch everything, science... and try to enjoy most of them... this however... terribly boring..!!!!  sometimes information shared isn't really worth the expense and effort.  Too bad for me I guess.",1513036800,,211,5.363636363636363
6255685,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Fabulous presentation and I loved the book too, Everyone should see and know this. Perfect for showing in schools.",1511049600,,114,5.052631578947368
6255686,5,B00IAR2CHY,"This is excellent! Very well made, and the visual fx are very helpful. This is one of those documentaries you know you'll watch at least a couple of times.",1510876800,,155,4.379310344827586
6255687,2,B00IAR2CHY,"Blathering host, very little science.",1510185600,,37,6.6
6255688,4,B00IAR2CHY,"It is a good series; however, in episode 3 they claim that crows are smarter than a poodle. The experiment they chose was not a very good one, and the breed of dog even worse. Crows are extremely motivated for food. I own a black standard poodle, and am very familiar with the breed and they are NOT motivated by food. In fact, they are very finicky eaters.

Make the experiment which can determine if a intruder has entered into their territory and the poodle would show far more ability than the crow. The crow is more clever, but the poodle is smarter.",1509408000,,555,4.388349514563107
6255689,3,B00IAR2CHY,"Pretty good, except for TOO MUCH HOST.  What ever happened to a documentary where the star was the subject matter, and not a person?  I don't care about the person's experience.  I want to know about the topic - in this case, human evolution.  I don't need to see someone talking into the camera, droning on about themselves constantly.  It's a waste of time and film.  More information, less personality - PLEASE. I understand these people are trying to become rich and famous.  I just don't want them to do it on my time and dime.",1508198400,,532,4.479166666666667
6255690,5,B00IAR2CHY,This is all so utterly fascinating. Hard to know where to begin. We are in revelationary times where genetics & archeology combine to answer so much about this miracle of life on earth. Thank you for this great work.,1507420800,,216,4.564102564102564

6255692,3,B00IAR2CHY,"I find his attitude arrogant, and there's not a lot of input from female scientists. Okay at best, not something I would recommend.",1506816000,,131,4.739130434782608
6255693,5,B00IAR2CHY,one of the best documentary about evolution,1506729600,,43,5.285714285714286
6255694,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Have only watched episode 1 so far, but I am extremely impressed with the content, the production quality and especially the animation. I can't wait to watch the remaining episodes.",1506643200,,181,5.066666666666666
6255695,5,B00IAR2CHY,I was looking for this after they took it off the PBS site. So glad prime has it now,1506124800,,84,3.473684210526316
6255696,5,B00IAR2CHY,Just fantastic! Great series!!!,1505088000,,31,7.0

6255698,5,B00IAR2CHY,About the best miniseries PBS has offered.  First rate science,1503964800,,62,5.2
6255699,5,B00IAR2CHY,Great information. I use this as a resource when teaching biology.,1499817600,,66,5.090909090909091

6255701,5,B00IAR2CHY,"This video is an excellent analysis of how humans have been influenced by evolutionary history. Neil Shubin does a terrific job of explaining his extensive research in a way that's entertaining and easy to understand. This video also contains ""Your Inner Reptile"" and ""Your Inner Monkey"". Highly recommend.",1495843200,,306,5.395833333333333
6255702,5,B00IAR2CHY,"I think I could have watched 50 more episodes of this.  It's a great intro to how we got a lot of our anatomical features, but I could have endured tons more depth.  The only problem I have is the limited number of episodes!",1495238400,,224,4.068181818181818
6255703,5,B00IAR2CHY,"My last copy walked away. It is a very easy way to slip into teaching evolution which can be a difficult to subject to teach, or at least to get buy in at first. I highly recommend it. Very logical presents lots of evidence in a friendly and entertaining format.",1495065600,,262,4.26
6255704,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Just terrific! Neil Shubin's discovery of Tiktaalik is of course groundbreaking. (Per Gary Larsen's famous cartoon of the fish staring at their baseball, knocked out of bounds and onto land -- Tiktaalik would be THOSE guys!)

But the program is beautifully assembled. Charming graphics -- from the first mammal-ish reptile exploring around his storage box, to the pen-and-inkish illustrations of the extremely fuzzy Tree of Life -- Shubin presents the whole process of life and presents it so beautifully.
What comes through is his ENTHUSIASM, his delight in these relationships. The segment on ""The Woman Who Is More Fish Than You Are"" was especially charming. She has me looking at all my friends, searching for their OUTER  fish.",1483574400,2,732,5.194915254237288
6255705,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Great program with a great host. Neil Shubin is now at the top of the list of people we want to invite to dinner! Accessible, but not dumbed-down, with some excellent location shots. Very much worth watching for any layperson with an interest in paleontology and/or human evolution.",1483228800,,282,4.895833333333333
6255706,5,B00IAR2CHY,The only change I would have made is more focus on Amphibians. Overall great up to date info. I could tell the host has knowledge and interest in the topic. The special affects are great.,1482796800,,187,4.371428571428571
6255707,5,B00IAR2CHY,A fascinating and well articulated documentary that is 'spoken in a language' which elicits a comprehensialbe education and enjoyment for all.,1482364800,,142,5.809523809523809
6255708,5,B00IAR2CHY,Very well done.  Quite interesting,1482019200,,34,5.8

6255710,5,B00IAR2CHY,Very interesting.,1479168000,,17,8.0
6255711,5,B00IAR2CHY,"After watching this, its hard to deny the path that the natural world has taken to bring us to where we are.
I first heard about this scientist through reading Bill Nye's book, ""Undeniable"".  If your having doubts about evolution, I highly recommend this television series as well as watching the Ken Hamm - Bill Nye debate on evolution.
This series demonstrates the empowerment that science provides us if we're interested in learning about the natural world.

6255713,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Great introduction to a fascinating topic. I read the book (listened to, actually) right after seeing this series and it was a great way to experience the material. Having the visuals from the PBS series made listening to the book much more vivid.",1473465600,,247,4.767441860465116

6255717,5,B00IAR2CHY,If you didn't belive in evolution before. You will know. I always believed and see it in our own time happening in front of us. But this guy lays is it out perfectly and logically so that a  even a 8 year old could completely understand and discuss it with you after watching.,1462838400,,276,4.2075471698113205
6255718,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Outstanding discussion of how the vestiges of evolution, development, and anatomy are seen in our own bodies. I show this to my Evolution class every Spring and they are always impressed.",1462579200,,187,5.064516129032258
6255719,5,B00IAR2CHY,"This is a must see.  Do you know how you have evolved from fish?  Do you know you go through stages of evolution in the womb, until you form into a human baby?  Watch this show snd find out!",1459209600,,190,3.8205128205128207
6255720,5,B00IAR2CHY,"A delightful lesson in three graphic entertaining videos of the certain steps between fishes which do not walk to those who do. I have read about ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny but I need someone to draw pictures for me, and here they are.",1459209600,,241,4.761904761904762
6255721,5,B00IAR2CHY,Show this to my middle schoolers. Dr Shubin talks plainly in language they can access. Also good graphics.,1458950400,,106,4.944444444444445
6255722,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Delightful film about the evidence for biological evolution from someone who works in the field everyday and has made significant contributions.  Unlike so many scientists, he is engaging on a social level.  Read his book also.  A good companion book is Jerry Coyne's WHY EVOLUTION IS TRUE.",1458777600,,290,5.127659574468085

6255733,1,B00IAR2CHY,"This video is garbage. Here let me find a sliver of a bone and then overlay some crazy computer generated animations over it. WALA proof that this fish can do a pushup? These are like your opinions man, and this video makes it hard to weed through what is fact and what this guy would like to be fact so that he can publish his book and make millions.

Edit. I just watched the inner primate section. Why is that no fossil remains are given names until you start talking about primates?  Psychologically trying to brainwash more of these ""facts"" that are really like more opinions man",1448755200,,584,4.4485981308411215
6255734,5,B00IAR2CHY,"This is a great show. I went ahead and brought the whole series, and have to say it will even keep little ones entertained (minus some of those dissection parts)",1447718400,,161,4.4
6255735,5,B00IAR2CHY,Very well done video. I show this video to my Advanced Biology class every year and they love it. Excellent job explaining very complex scientific processes in ways that everyone can understand,1447632000,,193,5.0625
6255736,5,B00IAR2CHY,"I tried giving this to my father as he had a complete misunderstanding on evolution.  This series is so great, easy to follow and entertaining so I thought if he watched it he could understand a bit more.  I would really hate for him to get embarrassed by expressing his understanding at a dinner party something in the future.  He was very nice and acted appreciative when he got it but days later my mother returned it to me by way of my 16 year old daughter.  I think she thinks that by giving him this I am somehow trying to get him to become Atheist.  I tried explaining to her that's not the case and that Atheism has nothing to do with evolution but she hasn't spoken to me since.  They are Catholic so I sent her links to videos of many including the Pope accepting evolution but that didn't change anything.  Oh well, I still feel this series is one of the best produced films on how evolution works and why and how we have supported it in so many ways to now consider it true.  I am sure I will get the chance to give this to someone else someday and If they don't like it or don't accept what it has to say, maybe they will simply throw it away instead of using my teenage daughter to show her disapproval of my fact based way of thinking.",1446163200,,1250,4.157676348547718
6255737,5,B00IAR2CHY,A must in any science nerd's collection!!!!,1445558400,,43,5.285714285714286
6255738,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Great up-to-date proof of evolution from fish to human.  Best for all ages.  There is no fraud or deception, contrary to what one misguided prejudiced reviewer has said.  Well worth watching all 3 sections.",1445385600,,206,5.0

6255741,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Excellent! I read the book, and learned a lot. This series presents what printed text cannot: The detailed look and feel of being there. I particularly like the format of presenting experimental findings from fossils, from embryos, AND from DNA analysis to support research conclusions. This and Shubin's book should be required material in every Intro Biology class.",1442102400,,367,5.344827586206897
6255742,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Very interesting, scientifically based and fun to watch. I enjoyed learning about how the legged creature, that connects fish with land-dwelling animals, was found.",1441411200,,164,5.875
6255743,5,B00IAR2CHY,"I first watched this as a judge when it was entered in competition. Far and away, the best. Anyone who wishes to make an entertaining science film should study this to learn how to do it.",1440633600,,187,4.222222222222222
6255759,5,B00IAR2CHY,I show this in my biology classes -- it ties together everything I've lectured about and the students really enjoy it.,1436745600,,118,4.666666666666667
6255760,5,B00IAR2CHY,"awesome, great episodes",1436486400,,23,7.0
6255761,5,B00IAR2CHY,"As a life science teacher I have shown this video to all my classes at some point: my anatomy students were floored about the fish fin/hand analogy and kept asking to see the rest (for the rest of the year).  While Dr. Shubin can get lengthy with backstory to his discoveries which turns off my younger, more immature 9th grade students at points it is still a great way to introduce and explain aspects of evolution with cool anecdotes.  None of my students forgot the fish gonads leading to male hernias example (and neither will I).  Well worth the money and will be used regularly.",1436486400,,585,4.552380952380952
6255762,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Excellent addition to the evolution section of our curriculum. There are on-line guides for the first 2 sections (Fish and Reptile), courtesy of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Everyone in our bio department is glad to have this.",1436400000,,234,5.184210526315789

6255766,5,B00IAR2CHY,"This is a great complement to the book. If you're into evolutionary biology, then this DVD is great to watch. Presented in everyday language that even non-science people can understand.",1435190400,,185,5.2
6255767,4,B00IAR2CHY,"Very interesting and entertaining show.  The first part was the best, the latter two declined in quality somewhat.  Excellent use of graphics too.  The computer graphics add a great deal to the content, rather than overwhelming it.",1431388800,,231,5.1891891891891895

Neil Shuban pertaining to ancestors we never knew we had; it begins with fish that came from the ocean onto land, and then
goes on to reptiles and finally when one branch of apes began to walk on two legs. Shubin uses both fossil records and DNA
evidence to present a saga of profound and sometimes funny story about our inner selves. Wonderful!",1424476800,,469,4.402298850574713

6255801,5,B00IAR2CHY,"This DVD offers a great explanation of not only your inner fish, but your inner reptile and your inner monkey!  Just waiting for your inner plant, and we'll be set!  Love this video because the links to our evolutionary past are made clearly, with no reason to disagree on scientific evidence, but to improve with scientific evidence!  Fossils, fossils, fossils say it all and it would be nice to have more dedicated paleontologists, geologists, biologists, geneticists- did I miss anyone? in the world.  Genetics research, another proven ground for scientific evidence of our evolutionary past is presented fairly here.  Lots of new information relative to the time of this post and works well with Shubin's Book, Your Inner Fish bringing some of the book ""back"" or to the surface while absorbing the video.  Obviously, visual stimulation is a great way to teach about human evolution and the evolution of our ancient ancestors and why the DVD was purchased in addition to the book.  There is a lot MORE to discover and uncover for all the future scientists out there, so badly needed in our aging world!

Neil Shubin claims he found the fossil, named Tiktaalik, which proved the evolutionary transition of fish to land animals.

Although the claim has since been disproved, some, including Shubin, continue to make the same assertion.

How was the claim disproved? Tracks were discovered in Poland dated by research scientists at 397 million years ago, which makes them fully 18 million years older than Tiktaalik. So, if four-legged animals existed 18 million years earlier than Tiktaalik, then Tiktaalik can not be the transitional fossil that Shubin claimed. It is instead a fish.",1421193600,,703,5.372727272727273

It is instead a fish.",1421193600,4,705,5.363636363636363

6255840,4,B00IAR2CHY,"Your Inner Fish from PBS and Shubin is to evolution what The Elegant Universe was to quantum physics and string theory. It's that fascinating, exciting, absorbing, and mind-blowing about life on earth and our origins and ancestors among much simpler organisms hundreds of millions of years old. Keep in mind that this is popular science for the masses. This has its pros and cons, but for the most part, it's all good.

I have not read Shubin's book yet, but after seeing all three episodes of Your Inner Fish, I am definitely going to read it. But while the title suggests that it's about the commonalities we have with fish, reptiles and monkeys, it only delves into certain commonalities in order to explain the resulting evolutionary divergences.

Through a combination of live action interviews; sped up video (e.g. assemblage of fossil skeletons or clearing of fossils in situ); CGI superimposed on the skeletons of living animals humans and fossils; close-ups through video monitors and microscopes; and animation reminiscent of that used in Neil DeGrasse Tyson's Cosmos flashbacks (which looks like a more elegant version of Adobe Shockwave, to me), Your Inner Fish tells the story of our evolution from primitive life forms over three episodes: Your Inner Fish, Your Inner Reptile, and Your Inner Monkey.

This series will please science geeks (there is a little simplification for lay people, but not as much as you'd think) as well as the interested general public, including older children and teens.

I would call this Evolutionary Biology 101 For Everyone. It does a great job explaining the evolutionary tree. While it does not ever directly address creationism/intelligent design, it lays out the facts of evolution in plain language and in an understandable narrative. You could say that the common ancestry and evolution of larger multicelled organisms on earth -- including us -- is given an overview in a very entertaining and yet thought-provoking way. Shubin's excitement is infectious and enthusiastic and that carries over to the viewer.

Animated fossil animals added to the live action, though may confuse smaller children. They probably won't understand that it is a rendering of what we think the ancient animal looked like; they may think it is a real animal in the scene.

Unless you majored in evolutionary biology and have an advanced degree in it, I think almost anyone can learn something new from the three episodes in this series. And, like The Elegant Universe series on Nova, this is not just a showcase for the original author of the book Neil Shubin. Yes, he hosts the episodes and he interviews the other scientists. But many other renowned anthropologists and paleontologists are also presented -- even the grad students and fellows are credited!

The first episode reminded me how strangely happy, absorbed, and respectful I felt of the former humans/cadavers I dissected during my introductory anatomy classes when I took my nursing school prereqs. The second and third episodes reminded me how exciting it was to go rock and fossil hunting as a kid, and why I loved going to the museum so much, looking at skeletons and fossils. I'm nothing but a rank amateur at all of that, but I have enough knowledge and background to know that everything presented by Rubin is true, i.e. I knew about Lucy. However, I did not know about Ardipithecus, the other bipedal ""missing link"" fossil.

In addition to really enjoying this on an intellectual level, a few things have resulted in my great affection for this series.

First is the showcasing of Chicago. Since Shubin's home is at the University of Chicago, the cutaway exterior shots are often to Chicago's downtown urban landscape via the skyline or overhead helicopter shots, mostly at night when it looks most gorgeous (reminiscent of the overhead shots from Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy). These shots make Chicago look like a glittering citadel of giant skyscrapers and imposing steel and glass architecture; their inclusion feels almost like a love song to Chicago hidden in these episodes.

Of course, the presentation of such a modern urban hub illustrates what the evolution of the human brain and ingenuity can accomplish and contrasts with what we started out as (little fish), which is probably the point. And other recognizable cities are included when Shubin travels to them to meet with other scientists (London, for example). But Chicago's beauty is referenced again and again in all three episodes, more than any other city. I liked that very much.

Second, I really like that the work of post-docs and grad students is credited, including the discovery of Ardipithecus's hand bone by Ethiopian grad student Yohannes Haile-Salassie while working with Tim White. It helps illustrate that this kind of work is highly collaborative and sometimes large teams are involved.

Third, I really like that the very long periods of time required to find these incredible fossils is portrayed. Shubin's work is portrayed as returning to the same area of arctic Canada to find the first fish that crawled onto land over a period of more than a decade. Many other paleontologists interviewed also explain -- and Shubin emphasizes -- that they and/or other paleontologists have worked and searched in the same particular area of the world (the Rift Valley, the Karoo, Bay of Fundy) for literally years and sometimes *decades* -- often for years and years, finding nothing, or finding only tantalizing fragments that keep them coming back, knowing there is probably something bigger there.

The length of time it takes, the diligence and perseverance required, to find these amazing ""missing link"" fossils is not often explained in the more exciting dramatizations of fossil hunters and their professional lives. This is something children and teens interested in these fields need to see and understand, so that they get a more realistic portrayal of how the professions really work.

Fourth, the incredibly collaborative nature of this work is also portrayed, as anatomists, embryologists, geneticists, anthropologists, geologists, sedimentologists and many other scientists are included in the discussions. As you see how their research and data supports each other's work, the viewer realizes that though today's scientists may ""stand on the shoulders of giants,"" the nature of their research today requires collaboration and cooperation for great advances.

Now, I also have some issues with Your Inner Fish.

First, I was really excited when they mentioned the human genome in the first episode. I was hoping that there would be an eventual discussion of the fact that huge portions of our genome are also shared with species as diverse as butterflies, plants, giraffes, etc. -- or at least that there would be some overview of how much of the genome of all living things is shared.

This is not done at all. Selected genes (such as ""hedgehog"" and ""sonic hedgehog,"" responsible for development of digits on extremities) are discussed. But the commonality of large portions of the genomes of many widely different organisms, from insects to humans, is not mentioned

Second, the sense of smell and the olfactory system are almost entirely ignored. It is barely mentioned in passing when we are told that loss of our primate ancestors' great sense of smell occurred when, and was necessary for the development of, color vision evolved in our eyes. Shubin says that there was a trade-off when we developed increased color sensitivity in the opsins in our retinas, and most of the genes common with other mammals for the sense of smell are turned off in humans. That's it.

No mention is made that olfaction is the only human sense that directly interfaces with the environment -- that is, that molecules of air and odor directly bond with olfactory receptors (likely a remnant of ancient fish ancestors; the sense of smell originally evolved in water). It is not pointed out that olfactory connections to the amygdala and the limbic system of the brain are part of the oldest parts of the brain, commonly called ""the reptile brain"" -- also responsible for our ability to recognize facial expressions and for our instinctual fight/flight/freeze survival reactions. (This is also why odors can sometimes jog vivid memories.) No mention is made of pheromones, which affect us even though we can not consciously smell them -- remember the experiments that proved pheromones synchronized the menstrual cycles of women living together in all-female dorms?

Furthermore, dysfunctions in the amygdala and the limbic system, especially in the areas of recognizing facial expressions and knowing where or what to look at, are symptomatic of autism and autism spectrum disorders. Neurotransmitter dysfunctions in this area of the brain may also be responsible for anxiety/panic disorder, but the fight/flight/freeze reactions were once a survival mechanism. Considering how much of this area of the brain we have in common with other animals, how could the amygdala and the limbic system have been left out of this series? They are some of the oldest brain structures outside of the brain stem (which is also left out). I was kind of dumbfounded and really disappointed that they were never even mentioned. If this is reflective of Shubin's book, I'll have the same objection to the book, because this is a huge omission.

If this information is included in the book, and was left out of the series for purposes of brevity or simplicity, I understand... but I still think it's a terrible omission and that the series should simply have been expanded to include this information. This is a huge area of commonality with the brains of other animals and should be included in any discussion of our evolution.

The only thing I can figure is that there aren't many brains in the fossil record because soft tissues tend not to be preserved, so there might be relatively little to compare it to. But you can still compare our brains to those of modern animals descended from, and there are animals that have remained relatively unchanged for millennia down to the present day to compare to as well.

Now, to be fair, although the evolution of our senses of hearing and sight are covered, the sense of taste/gustation are also ignored, as are the brain stem and a whole host of other organ systems (cardiovascular, digestive, etc.). It is clear that certain senses, organs, and developmental periods were selected for comparative purposes, and many (most) others were left out.

This is not necessarily a good or bad thing; there are probably far too many areas of commonality to produce a concise, 3-episode series of specials on this topic (or for that matter, to cover in one book without it turning into a thousand-page tome).

I just found it curious that one of the senses we have in common with some of our oldest fish and reptile ancestors was left out except for a brief mention, and the oldest brain structure (other than the brain stem), which we also have in common with the same ancestors, isn't even mentioned.",1416096000,4,11102,5.050245767340251

6255876,5,B00IAR2CHY,"This 3-part video series has as its centerpiece the discovery of a new (but very ancient) species, in fossil form in the Arctic, that has been named Tiktaalik. This ancient species had skeletal and anatomical development that places it at the exact point (in the geological and evolutionary time scale) at which fish developed limbs and lungs to move from their native water environment to the land at shore's edge. Tiktaalic had gills _and_ lungs. His eyes had moved from the sides of his head to the top center, as his head had flattened and his fin bones had elongated into stout stubs that could function to move his body like stumpy legs across the solid land of ancient shores.

Tiktaalik is the legendary ""Darwin fish"" in real life, the transitional species from water to land that further developed into other land animals that left the oceans and lakes behind permanently.

We still have traces of Tiktaalic and his fish ancestors in our own bones and organs. This documentary and the information it presents are eye-opening and fascinating, and the newly-discovered fossil and evidence fills in some gaps in our picture of prehistoric and ancient life, and shows how from an anatomical viewpoint, the more things have changed, the more they have stayed the same in many ways. We are so lucky to have scientists like Neil Shubin whose research illuminates and adds so much to our knowledge.

I appreciated the very clear statements about not drawing conclusions without empirical data, e.g., whether or not an early mammal had hair.  I want my students to learn that lesson.

Dr. Shubin's enthusiasm and wonder are evident throughout all three segments and I love that.  My students see that working scientists aren't all painfully somber guys in starched white lab coats, toiling away in the lab.

6255886,5,B00IAR2CHY,"I wasn't going to write a review until this DVD set was officially released, but seeing how the trolls are starting to bash it, I've decided to post this brief review having watched all three episodes with my honors high school biology students.

I admit I was apprehensive about the series, as I really enjoyed and appreciated the book. A flowing narrative of real science, Your Inner Fish (the book) contains a wealth of detail regarding evolution, modern genetics, anatomy and physiology. The book has been a favorite of mine - as well as my students - for its balance of content and accessibility. How would a video adaptation of the book successfully convey the scope and detail of the book, without possibility over-diluting it for the general public?

Quite simply stated: superbly. Shubin is a terrific guide; extremely telegenic and animated. I first saw Shubin in PBS previous series on Evolution. His boyish enthusiasm, articulate yet succinct explanations, and passion for his subject are well conveyed (interestingly, some of my students viewed his enthusiasm as being egotistical and somewhat arrogant - perhaps this is true, but they all agreed that if that's the case, it's well-deserved. Heck - has anyone had the opportunity to hear James Watson speak?)

The episodes, Your Inner Fish, Your Inner Reptile, and Your Inner Monkey are arranged to convey the evolutionary scope and sequence of human evolution. The digital illustrations, that bring to life extinct species - at times literally in the palm of Shubin's hand - are extraordinary, and help enormously with students' visualizations of reconstructions. The animated sequences appear to have been created by the same, excellent, artists who created the sepia-toned, ""pop-up-book"" style graphics for Tyson's Cosmos series.

While I found the first episode to be the most compelling, students each had their favorite. The final episode allowed them to meet the famous australopithecine ""Lucy"" for the first time which generated much subsequent discussion. In fact, that was the joy of watching this show with my class - the discussions the material generated following each screening. Students were obviously engaged and fascinated - the material generated questions clearly related to our course content, and allowed students to think of the material in a new way. Even those students who are faith based  - something I respect and do not attempt to ""change"" in class - were moved to see evolution as a process of God's miracle, similar to the personal ethos of Francis Collins. That is no small feat in itself.

I cannot recommend Your Inner Fish highly enough. Superb content, flowing interesting narrative, and state-of-the-art graphics that literally engaged a class ranging in age from 16 to 60 (guess who?). Shubin's Your Inner Fish provides compelling information and further reasons why IFLS

How good is Your Inner Fish? Having just completed watching it online, I am purchasing a copy for my DVD library. Not merely for future classes, but for my own personal enjoyment as well. Five stars!

Update: Now that the DVD has been released, I simply want to verify the product description: that this is a single, dual-layer DVD with 180+ min of content. Frankly, I would have expected a two-disc set at this price point.",1399075200,41,3298,5.117100371747212
6255887,5,B00IAR2CHY,Great movie. I will use it in my classroom. Good introduction to evolution. Shows transitions of organisms nicely. Will recommend,1398988800,2,129,5.5
6255888,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Neil Shubin and PBS have teamed up to make a fascinating series about the evolutionary history of the human body. Shubin helped discover the Tiktaalik, a transitional fossil with features of both fish and amphibians. He uses this organism to make comparisons between fish anatomy and human anatomy, eventually expanding into other subjects of comparison like reptiles and primates. The series has 3 parts: Your Inner Fish, Your Inner Reptile, and Your Inner Monkey. All three are worth watching and sharing.

1) Your Inner Fish covers topics such as hand/wrist bones, hernias, formation of limbs, and the paleontology behind the discovery of Tiktaalik.

2) Your Inner Reptile covers topics including amniotic eggs, skin, teeth, hair, and small mammal-like reptiles.

3) Your Inner Monkey reviews topics like posture, color vision, skulls, brain size, and transitional hominids.

All parts are about an hour in length and transition into many different areas that I didn't mention. Shubin shows examples of the process of science through controlled experiments. He emphasizes the predictive power of evolution, leading scientists to correctly guess the location of Tiktaalik fossils. Human anatomy is a major theme. This covers a broad range of scientific fields, keeping your interest throughout. Shubin never seems like he is talking down to the audience. I would strongly recommend buying the series and showing it to anyone who has an interest in the natural world.",1398816000,17,1468,5.369565217391305

6255890,5,B00IAR2CHY,"Neil Shubin integrates anatomy, biomechanics, historical geology, stratigraphy, embryology, geological maps, biochemistry and genetics to describe the discovery of species intermediate between fish and reptile. In his telling Shubin goes takes the viewer beyond simple curiosity to an appreciation of the our inheritance from a fossil remote in distance and time.",1398816000,,363,6.137254901960785

Give it another 25 to 50 years and you'll see how the story changes again someone else is going to come up with another crap. Remembered we started with 1 flat planet, then 1 round planet then 9 planets. Who knows how many are there. This is a great sci-fi or history channel documentary not 8 or 16 week waste of my college time and money.",1398211200,5,449,4.113636363636363
6255895,5,B00IAR2CHY,"I am pre-ordering this right away. It was a great series. As a PhD student in biology some science programs dealing with biology can at times not hold my attention. This one taught me some truly amazing things making me appreciate the evolutionary process even more. Shubin's excitement is infectious. On top of that, my fiance, who is not a science person (she works in college administration) absolutely loved it. The show is completely accessible even if you don't have much of a science background and will leave you with many ""that's so cool"" moments. I would recommend it to all of my friends and family.",1398211200,35,610,4.764150943396227

6255898,5,B00IAR2CHY,"I've seen two episodes of this series and have been delighted by the excellent storytelling and production. What's even better is that the science presented isn't watered-down. The first episode includes a compelling sequence with students and Dr. Shubin working with human cadavers in a teaching lab. The message of those images is important - our bodies incorporate the legacy of our evolutionary history and our anatomy only makes sense when illuminated by evolutionary biology and paleontology. In a time when fake documentaries about mermaids are standard fare for so-called science programming, ""Your Inner Fish"" shows that real science is amazing and can indeed make for compelling television. I hope to see many more science series from Tangled Bank Studios. This is a spectacular first effort from this new production company established by Howard Hughes Medical Institute.",1397865600,13,882,5.445255474452555

8640443,4,B00IAR2CHY,"This package brings together three 55-minute specials on evolution by Chicago biologist Neil Shubin.  The first traces the evolution of fish to amphibians, and notes that some early traits survive in mammals to this day.  An interesting aspect of this is the way in which genes determine how embryos develop limbs.  The second describes how early reptiles evolved mammal-like characteristics.  For a long time, mammals could not compete with more successful reptile species, but the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago gave mammals a foothold.  The third examines how human traits such as color vision and bipedal walking developed from more primitive primates, and traces similarities between human and ancestral brains.  The narrative is engaging, particularly in the way in which it shows the links between species that evolved millions of years apart.",1526083200,,864,5.41044776119403
8640444,5,B00IAR2CHY,"I watched this on Amazon when it became available to Prime members. It is a very entertaining series, free from the meaningless, repetitive, sensationalist garbage on the History Channel. Your Inner Fish is Public Television. We, the people, are its sponsors.  Evolutionary biology (as expressed by the genome or skeletal mechanics rather than by behavior) is highly complex and technical. Any program that can popularize it and remain accurate and amusing, with the humanity of the presenter clearly expressed, is worth a second look. Ontogeny may not recapitulate phylogeny, but physiology sure does illustrate it.  I enjoyed the series very much.
Some reviewers have dissed the CGI. OK, so it is somewhat clumsy. This is not a big-budget Hollywood extravaganza. I think perhaps it is not such a bad thing. We do not, after all, know what these animals looked like, exactly, and it's good for folks to realize that. Approximations that show how an animal might have moved is an excellent middle ground.

Series host and narrator Dr. Neil Shubin is quite geeky; he is, by turns, over-enthusiastic (happily dissecting a real human cadaver on camera) and over-simplistic (gasping, ""Wow, that's a lot of snow!"" during an Arctic paleological expedition).  Shubin is a serious scientist with amazing credentials, I know, but he's trying too hard to be Bill Nye the Science Guy, which is incredibly irritating.",1513382400,,512,5.468354430379747
