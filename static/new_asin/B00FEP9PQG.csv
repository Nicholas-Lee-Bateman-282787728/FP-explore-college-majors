5981711,5,B00FEP9PQG,This was given to my son as a gift for christmas and he loves it. I will also be getting him the next season.,1384992000,2,109,3.5833333333333335
5981712,5,B00FEP9PQG,"The Boardwalk Empire TV series on HBO is justifiably noted for its good acting (especially from Steve Buscemi as the shrewd but conflicted 'Nucky' Thompson) and its excellent costuming and period set decorations.  The series primarily covers Atlantic City, New Jersey in the 1920's with its emphasis on the rise of organized crime during the Prohibition era.  Although the history of the period is sometimes distorted for dramatic effect, the character development in the series is well done.  Again, Buscemi's performance alone is worth the price.  Arnold Rothstein, Lucky Luciano, Al Capone as well political 'luminaries' of this era (such as Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury under Coolidge) all make recurring appearances.  This is one of HBO's best dramatic series.",1384992000,44,777,5.3884297520661155
5981713,5,B00FEP9PQG,"Boardwalk Empire is some of the best TV ever made, exactly what I would expect from HBO which has brought us Band of Brothers, Game of Thrones and The Pacific.  Watching this show puts you back into the 1920's with incredibly accurate sets, costumes and locales.  The casting is impeccable and the scripts keep your attention completely.  The actors all do an incredible job making the characters deep, complex and relatable in their flaws.  It can be brutal at times, but it is a series about the rise of the mobs.  This is a signature achievement in TV.  Enjoy",1384128000,43,562,4.626262626262626
5981714,5,B00FEP9PQG,"I bought the first three seasons for about 30 dollars each. The price for season four is criminal! Drop that price by half and we will have a deal.

Amazon did as I asked and dropped the price! You should all thank me now! Great Americans like myself is what makes life so easy on the rest of you sheep! Changed my rating to five stars and one more time. Thanks to Amazon for doing as I requested!",1384128000,15,397,4.089743589743589
5981715,5,B00FEP9PQG,"I have purchased all 3 of the first, second and third season DVD's and have season 4 on pre-order with Amazon. I think it is very well cast and well acted. A good plot all the way through. Maybe growing up in NJ had a positive influence on my decision to purchase them. If you liked the Soprano's series and the Godfather movies, I am sure you will enjoy the Boardwalk Empire. If those series were not to your liking, this one will not be either.",1383091200,24,446,4.1976744186046515

5981726,5,B00FEP9PQG,"HBO wanting me to join, to see season 5? No way!! That has only made me happier that I cut the cord two years ago. Monthly cable bills kept creeping higher and higher. Lets see how HBO does on its own. Since they're ending it's contract with Amazon in 2018.",1494806400,,257,4.16
5981727,5,B00FEP9PQG,"I'm with many of the other reviewers:  trying to separate my loyalty to and enjoyment of the show from the ""games"" with Season 5.  If I am looking at it correctly, Season 5 was released FOUR YEARS AGO.  We Prime members ponied up the annual fee, and it seems like we should have the small privilege of seeing the last season of a show we have stuck with this long.

Whether it's HBO or Amazon that's holding back, one or the other or both need to loosen the reins and do the right thing.  Most people will not pay for it out of sheer frustration.  Please do the right thing; it's not too much to ask.  Many thanks.",1494633600,,614,4.1525423728813555
5981728,2,B00FEP9PQG,i was disappointed in S4's ending.  it was depressing.  also the decision making leading to events this season were really bad and didn't make much sense.  at least this wasn't the finale so they didn't end things on this note which would've been awful.,1493424000,,253,4.704545454545454

5981909,5,B00FEP9PQG,"Boardwalk Empire has a great plot along with a terrific cast of characters that takes its audience through the Prohibition years.  It is hard to believe that between 1920 and 1933 the U.S. outlawed the making and selling of alcohol.  Most people, since time immemorial enjoy taking a drink.  Yet for 13 years misguided do-gooders were able to criminalize what nearly all cultures take for granted as just one of those things most normal people do.  Prior to 1920 organized crime was small time.  By 1933 organized crime in the U.S. had multiplied a hundred fold on both a national and international level.  People like to drink so when the do-gooders convinced their Congressmen to outlaw drinking, a whole underworld was created overnight to supply what most Americans really wanted.  The star of Boardwalk Empire is Steve Buscemi  as Nucky Thompson.  Nucky kills people.  He's charming and very very smart.  But prohibition is bad, and the law enforcement officials who try to enforce it are the real villains of Boardwalk Empire.  It is easy to identify with Nucky Thompson.  He gives people what they want, and he's a virtuoso at doing it.  Throughout this series one also meets Al Capone, Meyer Lansky, Dean O'Bannon, and many other colorful gangsters of the 1920's.  The actors playing these real life gangsters are truly entertaining.  But for me the most interesting character other than Steve Buscemi is Jack Huston who plays Richard Harrow, a World War 1 sniper who virtually lost half his face in combat.  Richard Harrow is the supreme assassin for the mob.  He's the consummate professional killer, a courageous man who rarely misses his prey.  One moment Harrow is chilling as he accomplishes his deadly missions.  The next, he's got a heart of gold.  In the end it's Nucky Thompson and Richard Harrow who are the real heroes of Boardwalk Empire.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extreme-Guns-and-Babes-for-an-Adult-World-Black-and-white-Edition/dp/0984893423/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extreme Guns and Babes for an Adult World: Black and white Edition</a>",1482624000,,2112,5.436923076923077

5981921,5,B00FEP9PQG,"I'm hooked on this show- in season 4 now.  It is violent, full of sex and full of story. Some say the sex and violence are excessive, but this is the world these people lived in . Nucky is a character with many layers and the actor is spellbinding (remember Tony Uncle Al from the Soprano's- same actor very different character) The characters come and go, and you get hooked on the new ones while you miss the ones who have left. The story lines are intriguing, and the smut belongs in them. Right up there with Downton Abby and The Sopranos.",1482364800,,543,4.323529411764706

So many things in the show take place at night, and it can be very difficult to see what is happening.

5982011,3,B00FEP9PQG,"First three seasons were terrific.  Great locations, well developed characters, and good plot pacing.  It was compelling television.  Season 4 feels like a different show with a focus on a different set of locations, most of which are brand new to the series.  The locations are inferior in almost every way.  Many characters that were background players or totally non-existent in the first three seasons now take center stage.  The end product is ho-hum.  There's a reason why season four had lower reviews than the first three seasons.  At least the season finale wraps things up fairly decently, but given who's left in the show I'm not going to bother with season five, which again introduces new locations.  I'll probably just read a synopsis and watch the last few episodes.  I feel like if I had done that with season four, I would have enjoyed the show more than slugging through character arcs of unrelatable characters that are headed for oblivion anyways.",1480636800,2,967,4.91358024691358

5982017,5,B00FEP9PQG,We are extremely disappointed that we now have to pay to see season five. This is a pretty slippery trick after watching the preceding four seasons free.  We paid for the first of season session of season five and thought it went exceedingly downhill from the previous four seasons.

5982019,3,B00FEP9PQG,"Let's be clear - Boardwalk Empire, every season, rates more than five stars.  It's one of the most masterfully plotted stories on film today, weaving history with ""coulda-been"" together, and creating hugely flawed characters that you care about.  The one-minus rating that brings so many of the reviews down is due to not including the last season as part of Amazon Prime.  Perhaps HBO is asking impossible money for it, realizing that all of us who've binge-watched the first four seasons are slavering for the finale? Whatever.  I hope everyone involved takes a sharper pencil to the issue, and gives all us paying Prime members a break.",1480377600,,639,4.94392523364486

HOWEVER, much too much sex and nudity... none of it is needed.  It's easy enough to hint at those things with out so much crap in it.  And, the violence might be overkill at times....love the characters, love the actor that plays Enoch.... does a superb job.  As do they all.  LOVE IT, over all.  If not for the unnecessary sex scenes and nudity, I'd give it a five star!!!",1478304000,,533,4.377551020408164

5982164,5,B00FEP9PQG,"Boardwalk Empire is an excellent dramatic series, but not for the faint of heart. The characters are well drawn and completely believable. The story-line is intricate with interesting twists and turns, and depicts the age of Prohibition in a way that is probably closer to reality than any movie or television series to date. Nucky Thompson is a ruthless amoral mob boss, who also happens to be very human and even liveable. The sex and violence are often gratuitous. It is definitely R-rated, and not a show to watch with your children.",1477180800,,537,4.8478260869565215

5982400,1,B00FEP9PQG,"Boardwalk Empire is an excellent, absorbing show. I have thoroughly enjoyed season 1 through 4, and would give the entire series 5 stars -- except for the very annoying bait-and-switch perpetrated by Amazon. The first four seasons are available through Amazon Prime, but Amazon charges $25 for season 5, the last season of the series. Nowhere is this advertised. The announcement comes up only when you invoke season 5 from the series menu. This is not customer friendly; hence the one star. I will probably not use Amazon Prime Video in the future except for Bosch, when it returns.",1474243200,9,583,4.898989898989899

5982408,3,B00FEP9PQG,Losing interest. Seems like the creators were already running out of ideas and starting to just drag things out or add diversions to fill out another season.

At least this time I managed to get to the final season before being hit up for ransom money to watch something that the night before was free. It really irks me that there is no notification that a series is going to cost you even when it is advertised as an Amazon Prime series.

5982664,1,B00FEP9PQG,"The whole fourth season script looked patched together. The fate of Chalky's daughter was stupidly mapped out; not in the least bit believable that she would've entered that domain in that way to begin with. Valentin Narcisse was a grave disappointment as a villain after following Gyp Rosetti from season 3. They stuffed the shows with plenty of half-baked performances of period music at the Onyx Club. Particularly disturbing was the actress portraying Daughter  Maitland; one wonders who told her she could sing. Patricia Arquette as Sally Wheet was a joke; they tried to make her sexy but the first sex scene w/ Nucky was like watching a cow trying to rape a Rhesus Monkey. Nucky's final ending was also pulled out of some screen writer's rear end, like no one could think of what to do with him. Right at the beginning of season 4, I was disappointed, but followed it through to the end with the hope that things would pick up. Terrible writing. Some of the worst. HBO has definitely worn out the Sopranos/Deadwood/etc. Serial Drama model long ago.",1471737600,,1054,4.791208791208791

Boardwalk Empire is one of those rare series that doesn't get silly and sticks to its themes as the seasons progress, and season four is no exception. HBO has done a great job with this show and I only give it four stars because five stars are reserved for series that really light my world on fire, like Deadwood.",1470700800,,553,4.485148514851486

The clothes, the hair styles of both women and men are stunning. The furniture is handsome. The dialogue is a little rough but succinctly vivid. I'll probably watch it again. Oh, the acting is so real. I just love Chalky White. He sports a scar from his forehead to his chin which only serves to make him more desirable. And Steve Ischemi holds it all together with his calm, common sense attitude. All of the cast is more than believable. The music fits the timeline of the raucous twenties.

Like any other series, I really got into the story and the characters . After I finished season 3, you could not see season 4, unless you paid $2.99 and episode. What!! It's like you get hooked, then pay for the rest. Just finally got to see season 4 for free, had to go back a couple of episodes to remember what happened and who is who again on season3.

5983159,2,B00FEP9PQG,"I really, really wanted to like this series.
In the first place, Steve Buscemi is a great actor, annd frankly a pretty great human being, so I watch anything of his that I can. He's played such different parts; I'm thinkin of him in ""Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing' as well as the never to be forgotten Donnie in 'The Big Lebowski' in particular, but also of a smaller role he had as a racist murderer in an early episode of 'Homicide.' He just takes the role, and gives you a believable character. To my mind, though, what will forever set him apart is his return to work as a firefighter in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. He showed up at his old station, and worked like the other firefighters, and refused to be interviewed as a star. He's a blue-collar hero kind of guy.
The second reason I wanted to like the series is because of he subject material. In recent years, I have become convinced that the War on Drugs is one of the most destructive things we have done in America, and Prohibition was an early example of that. So, I woud like to flesh out my understanding of that era.
It started off great. Good performances, good story line, historical characters: I really was enjoying it. HOWEVER!
HOWEVER, I had to stop watching ity, because the decision makers found it necessary to include a very explicit live sex scene. I am not familiar with HBO shows, and maybe that's standard expectation. It wasn't what -I- wanted to watch, though, and so, regretfully, I stopped partway through the first episode of the first season.",1468454400,,1533,4.557971014492754

5983373,5,B00FEP9PQG,"The episodes for Season 4 are among the best of all Boardwalk Empire episodes.  This is due to the development of the two real stars of this series;  Jack Huston, who deserved an Emmy for his performances, and Michael Shannon, who gives equally compelling portrayals in Season 4.  These two do not get lost in the cavalcade of stars that appear in this mega-series.

However, in the later episodes, the flashbacks were overdone. And, don't get me started on the gratuitous female nudity and the use of one of the most obscene words in the English language. I am no prude, but there was a lot that could have been presented differently that would have still contributed to the story without the graphic assault.",1466812800,,470,4.674698795180723

5984003,5,B00FEP9PQG,"Continuing to really enjoy the show. Wish season 5 would be available with Prime right now but it's not. Don't want to pay or wait for it on Prime so I tracked it down on HBO directly. It continues to be great.

One thing I enjoy with this particular show is reading about it on Wikipedia while I'm watching. Many characters are actual people from history or they are based on a real person. I've also read a little more on Prohibition. The show is a nice blend of non-fiction and fiction which makes me curious to do some research while watching to show. Good stuff!",1464998400,,567,4.349056603773585

5984005,5,B00FEP9PQG,"This show is so well written.  Because of that, it also is addictive.

The show assumes you are at least a little intelligent.  There are no car classes, but you need to pay attention to the dialogue.  The acting is top notch and fast paced.

If you haven't seen seasons 1-3, please do so.

Thank you for allowing this to be viewed, well worth the time.",1464912000,,353,4.2727272727272725

As with other series that I started to watch, I got confused with so many characters and tangent side stories that I stopped watching because the series itself was not enjoyable or interesting enough to not make it a chore to watch.

5984065,4,B00FEP9PQG,"Would like to see the end of it, but apparently the last season isn't free to watch at this time.  So I can only say so far it's been pretty darn good.  It does have every facet of life covered--maybe a little too much so.  If you don't like violence, drug use, or explicit sexual scenes, I'd avoid it.  It made me uncomfortable in a few of the scenes, & I started closing my eyes during some scenes as well.  Again, that's just me.  The costumes were great.

Too much drama, not realistic, too sexually explicit, language too rough!  I'm not a prude and I think there are times language needs to be realistic.  In this show when the ""F"" word is used multiple times, it is not necessary.  I expected violence but I did not expect brutality.  thumbs down for me!!",1464652800,,447,4.444444444444445

I am very glad however that the beating of the woman occurred offstage and we did not have to witness that terrorizing event. Yet, all the characters have their special place in the pecking order and some are cheered when their demise occurs. This show has a ""want to know"" what happens next appeal.

George Washington was no hero, he and his gang of hoodlums and thugs murdered anyone in their path who would come against or stand in the way of their enterprise of lying, killing, murder, cheating and thievery.

If the foundation is corrupt so is the building. America was built on the blood of the ruthless. That philosophy existed then and it still exist and thrive today. Those running the government of America are still crooks in suit and tie. The mob runs the show and there is no doubt it.

We were fooled then then but its a different story today. The movies are revealing all that has and is taking place behind the scenes in the running of America. Its a stage being played out in blood. But remember this, its a stage and everyone play a part. Also remember, all get paid their due wages after we all play our part.",1464566400,,937,4.410404624277457

Oh, it is still the Roaring 20s and there is still all of the nasty dealings of the crime syndicates in the major Eastern cities.  But it is much more compelling to watch.

A series about what's next, who's next, who survives and for how long.  A morality play that relies upon the proposition that evil begets evil and that evil will not only ""out"", it will also exact it's own kind of justice.  The Bosses devour themselves as they scheme to increase and hold on to their power, while they are being tested and measured by their underlings and rivals.  All are imbued with the same greed, ambition and ruthlessness.  There are no good guys, just some interesting bad ones.",1464048000,,637,5.096153846153846

Not a show for everyone but well done. Watch all the little things that Steve does that probably makes him an actor's actor. For example, he gives the slightest of winks or nods or expressions so subtle they could easily be missed If you blink.

5984538,4,B00FEP9PQG,"Very well-written with a few anachronisms (in the 1920s one character describes himself as feeling ""pixilated""). Has the ""Godfather"" feel to it and a little too much switching back in time for my tastes but lots of action and a binge-streaming film that holds you to the end. Cinematography is top rate.

5984646,5,B00FEP9PQG,"As with all of HBO's productions; the values are unbeatable. The writing, directing, the whole mood and atmosphere draws a person in making it a totally riveting experience. Even the violence, thought brutal; is not gratuitous, in context with both character and plot. Steve Buscemi is amazing, as usual; and Jeffrey Wright 's character is portrayed with a smooth and quiet dignity, which only underscores how dangerous and ruthless he really is. I'm so glad this season is finally on Prime. I don't plan on skipping one episode.",1463443200,,529,5.0227272727272725

I feel the story could have been more exciting. The characters are getting ready to make a new deal and they will go on for a few episodes debating about it. Boring.",1463443200,,435,4.37037037037037

5984673,4,B00FEP9PQG,"Excellent series as one comes to expect from HBO.  This is one of the best period pieces I have ever watched.  The cast, clothing and characterizations were spot on.  The lack of the 5th star was due to the depressive story line and the complete absence of humor.

5984788,5,B00FEP9PQG,"I liked it a lot especially the part of Marcus Garvey's UNIA. There is too much of what was truly happening in Harlem in the late 1910's & 20's to put into a series. The falling apart of the Garvey movements UNIA after his arrest was not what I read in books or what my family has talked about over the years. Colin Grant's book ""A Negro With a Hat"" has the most current information on Marcus Garvey, his upbringining, his family, education and his movement. As films are and never could be close to experience of the oral or printed book I did like the fact that someone has attempted to talk about the Garvey Movement. What is next for the producer Mark Whalberg? A movie on Marcus Garvey??? If so that would be great...there are still a few of the children alive that had the 1st-hand experience of the parades with their parents on the streets of Harlem during the glorious days of the UNIA. A lot of them have recently passed on without leaving journals of their time here. Thankfully my brother has been collecting the history of that time from our mother and maybe one day someone would like to use this info or try to understand what was happening in Harlem and expanding in the world. The Leader Marcus Garvey struggled and succeeded to include the diverse people of color from the Black Jews, Muslims, Christians and their different sects together. The struggle continued well after Mr. Garvey's expulsion from the United State. All I can say about Boardwalk Empire is that I purchased the book by Nelson Johnson so that I could understand the series. As in Mr. Johnson's book and Mr. Whalberg's movie there are a lot of things that could not be put into film. I gave Boardwalk Empire 5 stars because it gave me the incentive to read more books on Mr. Garvey, which I've learned why Ghana's flag has a ""Black Star"" on it's flag, the I differences Mr. Garvey had with the Black Star-liner's 1st Captain and countless other stories.

 Also, this show has been over since 2014 so why do you have seasons one through four and then conveniently not have season five?
 But anyhow, I watch season five on solar movie. Honestly, they should have ended it's in season four. Season five is stupid, and pretty much pointless.

How women were treated by society, the strength of faith,how the black family actually existed as families, beautiful costumes, there is a lot here if you pay attention! I would recommend it absolutely. It is a little rough at times, so maybe watch an episode before younger viewers were to see it.

5985125,3,B00FEP9PQG,"Started out very strong, but I have to say the last few episodes are just one ridiculous mishap after another. Characters who should
die are saved by Act of God, despite a hail of gunfire. Other characters die for no better reason than to prove how ""gritty"" and hard-boiled
the writers are. And it's all so predictable. Everyone is standing exactly where they shouldn't be standing. Every double-cross is easily foiled unless the plot demands it succeeds, then those double-crossed are eliminated without the slightest difficulty (ever heard of bodyguards?). Ominous
foreshadowing abounds. Promises are made which clearly won't (or can't) be kept. The Gillian Darmody subplot was just dumb. The show jumped the shark with this season. Not sure I want to watch Season 5.",1454025600,,769,5.111111111111111

But viewer beware!  The first 3 series were free with Prime,  the last 2 series carried a very hefty fee!  I don't recall seeing  written anywhere that would be the case.  So we will concentrate on Netflix offerings. I can't help but feeling duped when this happened, plus the fees vary.  One season will be a different charge than another season sometimes double the cost.  So disappointing!",1453507200,,554,4.757894736842105

Very short sighted and the best way I know to send me to NetFlix! Alas the last Boardwalk Empire I watch. Shows like this is why I had a prime membership. To bad Amazon is trying to squeeze more money from it's customers. Makes the competition more attractive and I do not even have to pay extra to watch.

However, do not be discouraged.  This season is an excellent one and well worth owning.  Chalky is much more involved in this one.  So if you are a fan of his, you will like this one a lot.  Nucky's marriage with Margaret is all but over and you will not see her until about midway, but she plays her own interesting part as well.  Jillian struggles with her heroin addiction but she is a fighter.  Ron Livingston plays a grocery store chain owner who comes into her life and things do get interesting.  Maybe she finds a decent man?  Richard only gets close to Tommy and his ""new"" family.  Nucky himself finds a new girlfriend who will definitely get your attention.  Nelson has his own struggles to go through as well, which as always, are nothing short of hilarious.  Lots of good gangster fun!",1439596800,2,943,4.381502890173411

5985328,3,B00FEP9PQG,"The first season, through the middle of the second season, represented television at its best.  And, I will admit, the third and this fourth season were addictive, and I wait in anticipation of the fifth season (I never saw the series when it was on HBO).  However, this anticipation has been dumbed down to the kind of guilty pleasure akin to a General Hospital jones.

(SPOILER ALERT)  The honeymoon kind of faded midway through the second season, when Margaret's activities began to seem very unlikely for someone of such supposedly deep Catholic roots (this culminated eventually in her having a sexual affair with Owen, her husband's second in charge).  Furthermore, we also see a dedicated Christian husband who heads the Anti-Alcohol Bureau eventually turn into a gangster, making for titillating (if not realistic) television viewing.  Now, during season four, we are led to believe that Chalky does not throw his employee under the bus for killing Pastor after being urged to shag his white wife under gunpoint....instead, willingly giving up 10 percent of his club to save the employee, who, although he didn't deserve to be subjected to Pastor's cruelty and racist murder threats; could have made matters better by keeping his fly zipped up and rejecting Ms. Pastor's initial advances in the club.  Under those circumstances, does anyone with half a brain think that the extremely Christian Chalky White would not offer up this guy to the Dr. instead of giving up 10 percent of his club just to save one philandering employee?  I just don't see that.  I think that Chalky would have protected Pern from the Dr. and the lying Ms. Pastor; but I just can't see the staunchly Baptist Chalky (although subsequently, he too would engage in his own infidelities) taking food out of the mouths of his children's mouths to save the neck of an employee who willingly sought to have sex with a married white woman, which in addition to being sinful was a dangerous and foolhardy endeavor that put both Chalky and the economic livelihood of the club in danger.

The series, in other words, has become less and less believable with time.  Still, very addictive TV., but not at the five star quality of the first two seasons.",1436918400,,2222,4.882978723404255

5985332,5,B00FEP9PQG,"Both season one and two are excellent, though I have to wonder if some actors were asking for a raise or were tired of working in the series. I would have liked to see more character development and further involvement in the series before killing off what I would consider one of the most interesting characters of the show and his wife. Shock and surprise in this instance (season finale) was a negative for me and I thought the writers could have done better, this is the type of writing that makes one wonder who departs next and if one should even bother taking an interest. All in all a great series though, but the producers will have to dig deep to produce interesting replacements without ending up being a run of the mill product, don't see what is left carrying this series....as you can tell, I'm not a big fan of killing off main characters to twist the audience.",1436400000,,876,4.48125

5985341,4,B00FEP9PQG,"Season 4 of HBO's excellent BOARDWALK EMPIRE picks up in early 1924, a few months after the events of the third season as Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson sits down and makes peace with Joe ""the Boss"" Masseria and Arnold Rothstein from New York after the war caused by the late Gyp Rosetti.  Everyone agrees to pay up what they owe for the trouble they've cause, let bygones be bygone, and everyone will go back to the very lucrative business of quenching America's thirst during Prohibition.  But Nucky will soon learn in Season 4, peacetime can be just as much a hell as war.

That's because none of these characters are ever truly satisfied with what they've got and there is always some scheme to make a little more at someone else's expense, such as Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano's plan to import heroin up from Florida, hidden away in cases of bootleg whiskey being transported in Nucky's trucks. Or Al Capone, who is no longer satisfied being Johnny Torrio's second in command in Chicago.  Then there is Federal Agent Knox, who is not content to just to arrest bootleggers in Atlantic City, he wants to nail the whole organization (Nucky, Masseria, Rothstein and all the rest) in one big bust, and to hell with who you have to threaten, lean on or leave twisting in the wind to get there.  Ambition and desire prove to be poison for more than one character, and when the season is done nothing will be as it was before and some familiar faces and fan favorites will bite the dust.

Another theme of this fourth season is family and the ties that bind or break: Chalky White pretends to the family man, but not when he's inside his Onyx Club on the boardwalk and his eye wonders to the new jazz singer, the ironically named Daughter Maitland; Willie Thompson, Nucky's college student nephew plays a deadly prank on a classmate and turns to his uncle, not his father, for help; the disfigured Richard Harrow seemingly finds a home at last, but learns the past is not done with him; a twist of circumstances forces Eddie Kessler to confront the possibility of facing the sons he abandoned in Germany years before; and Gillian Darmody, alone in the world and addicted to drugs, desperately grasps at a chance to regain her grandson and make a new start with a new man.

All of this makes for a lot of drama, and there were many who have complained that in Season 4, some of it was stretched beyond credence after what we had seen in the three previous seasons. That Eli Thompson would not have gotten himself back into a fix where he'd be forced to betray his brother yet again or that Chalky White would not abandon his family, not to mention his position in the community, after failing to kill a rival.  I think these are the problems many series get when they reach this point in their run and the writers have to keep spinning a yarn to keep the interest of the viewer.

More than just about any other recent TV show, BOARDWALK EMPIRE really set out to be an epic and it had the story telling pace of a big thick novel; something would happen in one episode and the repercussions would not be felt until much later, as with the the salesmen Nelson Van Alden did dirt back in Season 3 who return for vengeance at a most inopportune time in Season 4 (this really does not end well for someone or someones).  For this reason alone, BOARDWALK EMPIRE has always been a good candidate for binge watching-it looks fantastic on Blu Ray, they way I have watched it after renting the discs from Netflix.

As always the cast is near perfect, starting with Steve Buccemi as Nucky, a man who works very hard at never getting put in a corner.  This season allowed some supporting characters to shine, along with the actors who played them; this is especially true of Michael Kenneth Williams as Chalky and Shea Whigham as Eli Thompson along with Anthony Laciura as Eddie Kessler.  Plenty of familiar faces return as well: Stephen Graham's Al Capone; Michael Shannon's Van Alden; Erik Harvey's Dunn Purnsley; Jack Huston, who does his acting with half a face, as Richard Harrow; and Paul Sparks, ever annoying as Mickey Doyle.  Kelly MacDonold's Margaret Shroeder is largely absent from most of the season, and this is to her benefit. She actually acquits herself well in small subplot where she helps herself by helping Michael Stulhbarg's Arnold Rothstein.  Gretchen Mol has a great scene where her Gillian Darmody finally reaps what she has sewed.

There were some impressive new faces in this season, starting off with Patricia Arquette's Sally Wheet, a Florida rum runner who just might be Nucky's soul mate; Jeffrey Wright's Dr. Valentin Narcisse, a golden tongued fraud who pretends to help his race while lining his pockets with drug money (the first of many in American history); Ben Rosenfield's Willie Thompson, a chip off his uncle's block; Brian Geraghty's Agent Knox, a man who believes a little to strongly in doing what it takes to get the job done.  There is Eric Ladin as the young J. Edgar Hoover, just getting started on a career that would make him America's supreme bureaucrat and a master of public relations.  And old pro Lou Gossett Jr. reminds us he's still got the chops in a small part as Chalky's mentor.

The year 1924 was a crossroads for America, it's the year the Jazz Age, as it became known, arrived and perceptive Americans began to realize that Prohibition was a disaster, one which was leaving much wreckage in its wake.  But turning the country around would take time and much more would be lost in the futile war against intoxication.

Season 4 was also a crossroads for BOARDWALK EMPIRE, in four seasons, it had found many loyal and devoted fans, but it was clear that it would never be a smash hit on the level of THE SOPRANOS or BREAKING BAD.  So rather than continue on through the decade with Nucky Thompson battling with his various competitors over turf (which is what is implied in the season finale), HBO decided to wrap things up in Season 5 with a time skip to the early 30's.  A bittersweet decision for us fans who were willing to take the long ride with Nucky and the gang in Atlantic City.",1435017600,,6128,4.591575091575091

5985366,5,B00FEP9PQG,"Boardwalk Empire: Season 4 contains new threats for Nucky Thompson with federal law enforcement making its biggest attempt to dethrone organised crime in Atlantic City. Yet newer foe Dr Valentine Narcisses dash for a chunk of power proves to have a stronger grip than expected, and Nucky has to somehow juggle all the variables around him and see who is still left standing. Some familiar characters reach an end point by the conclusion of the season, which presents some overdue justice in one case, but in another a decent loyal character sadly runs out of luck. What Nuckys next venture will consist of adds to the excitement of wanting to watch Season 5.

5985379,5,B00FEP9PQG,"The entire series is a definite must see for anyone who has ever visited Atlantic City, or just has an interest in the ""roaring 20s"" time period. The sets, the costumes as well as the acting are way above the normal Hollywood crap so prevalent these days. Special attention is given to a fairly new star by the name of Jack Huston. His role in this series was one of intensity, and considering he played a disfigured WWI vet, his stage presence literally pulls you into the moment ( a very rare talent). It was no surprise then that Mr. Huston has been selected as the lead in the remake of the classic ""Ben Hur"".  For a truly powerful viewing experience, the Boardwalk Empire is highly recommended!",1428192000,,699,4.503937007874016

The same quality as the first  three seasons , and it certainly isn't getting stale or rehashing the same subject matter.

So many people are under the impression that this is a fact based series. It is not. So, with that out of the way, I liked it, but I wasn't blown away by it. Steve Buschemi is great, but some of the other characters are downright corny and pathetic. Not as realistic as it should be. I watched it and that's that.

Costumes, sets, and props well-researched and all replicas are beautifully produced.  For the nit-pickers, the only historical anomaly in the entire series is the appearance of Cutts Compensators on the M1921 Thompson submachine guns.  That, in itself, is the tiniest of quibbles.

The overall historical context of the story, in relation to US and world history, is just incredible!",1425772800,,497,5.4868421052631575
5985417,5,B00FEP9PQG,"The sets, the costumes, the music, the photography are the best I have ever seen {in my 84 years) for creating  ""the very age and body of the time, its form and pressure.""  The protagonist is beautifully drawn and played. A sizeable cast of supporting characters comes vividly to life to add mood, color and emotion, both raw and delicate. For lovers of ragtime, early dixieland jazz, barbershop harmony and vaudville, the use of original recordings and authentic recreations is a sheer delight.",1425686400,,495,4.951807228915663

It is also a good insight to how our political and legal system really work... criminals and ""respectful"" politicians all working hand in hand. Too bad out 5th estate, the news agencies, have been merged into 6 large groups that control 80% of the news. The news is largely propaganda today read to us by news readers.

Overall, the first three seasons were fast-paced and historically familiar. They even had me researching certain time frames. Drama-filled. Action-packed. In the fourth season, everything seems to be in slooooow  moooootion with a few fights, stabbings, and murders thrown in. I know Florida matters but I don't like it.

5985606,3,B00FEP9PQG,"Let me start off by saying that I got hooked immediately on season one of this series, watched season 2 and was put off by the final episode of that season. Just recently got reacquainted with the characters and story lines in season 3, going so far as to do a marathon of the episodes -- watching all 12 episodes in two nights. Now we come to season 4 and I have to say that I'm disappointed. Certainly the production values are still there, the performers are good at their craft, the ability to make a recreation of that era plausible. All of that is in place but what is lacking is two-fold -- a story worth telling and someone, anyone, you give a ""damn"" about. It appears that the writers and directors have decided to take full advantage of pushing the boundaries of violence as far as,  and as often,  as they can. It's now so predicable as to be almost mundane -- a dangerous place for the use of violence in a story, I think. In short at this point I would not recommend season 4. I may or may not finish watching the series. If I do, it will be mere curiosity and not excited interest that prompts me to do so. Too bad -- the creators probably should have quit and ended it with the third season. And of course the series bares no resemblance to the book it's based on but when it comes to Hollywood and books that's to be expected. Anyhow, that's my take on Season 4.",1414108800,4,1378,4.215909090909091

5985622,3,B00FEP9PQG,"I really love Boardwalk Empire and will be sad when its final season ends later this month.  But Season 4 was something of a disappointment for me.  The first two seasons of the show were brilliant and there was very little complain about them.  About the only irritant was Lucy Danziger and her whiny demeanor.

Season 3 was good but not in the same league of the first two seasons.  A lot of that has to do with a completely distracting major subplot dealing with Margaret Schroeder and her effort to bring proper prenatal care to the women of Atlantic City.  I also didn't like her additional storyline of a romance with Nucky's enforcer Owen Sleater.

In Season 4, Margaret's character with her annoying, holier-than-thou attitude was mostly absent, but there were some fresh irritations...

<spoilers>

1.  I found the entire story about Nucky's nephew Willy and his lethal practical joke at college to be completely uninteresting.  There's something about the actor playing that character that I found very unappealing.

2.  Having Eli betray Nucky yet again was a mistake.  It made no sense that Eli would have gotten himself into such a foolish predicament again.  I would have much preferred Eli continuing to be Nucky's right-hand man, a position he won after he redeemed himself in Season 3.

3.  Chalky's decision to go on the lam after an incompetent effort to assassinate Dr. Narcisse made no sense.  One attempt to kill his rival fails and he runs away with his girlfriend?  C'mon, Chalky was a fighter and I don't think he would have run away after failing once to deal with Narcisse.

4.  The Gillian story veered into absurdity with ""Roy"" going to such a prolonged effort to get her to confess to murdering Roger in Season 3.  I could believe he would romance her to get that confession...but help her kick her heroin habit and spend months with her and become intimate with her and stage that charade that finally got her to talk about the murder and have three of his fellow Pinkertons hiding in the closet to hear her confession?  That was just silly

Don't get me wrong:  the show had a lot of good points:

-The Onyx Club was a beautiful setting with wonderful period music and costumes. The actress who played Daughter Maitland can sing like a bird.

-Capone's rise to power with Van Alden helping him rather unwillingly was fascinating.

-The brutal fights between Chalky and Dunn Purnsely and Eli and his FBI handler were amazing.

-Buscemi was great as always and it was great to have him matched up with Patricia Arquette playing a woman who was much better suited to him than the conflicted Margaret.

<end spoilers>

A final thought...I'm a bit baffled by people loving the Richard Harrow character.  The actor playing him does a very good job with the character and I can see some aspects of tragedy in the character's life.  However, I find myself skeptical that some of the same people who profess admiration/sympathy for Harrow would want to be in the same state with a man who had killed as many people as he had (which included innocent people he had murdered on contract...including scalping an old man whose only crime was disrespecting Jimmy Darmody).

In any case, I will mourn Boardwalk Empire's departure, but I will watch Seasons 1 and 2 and the gangster scenes in Season 3 more than Season 4.",1413244800,3,3336,4.724436741767764

Nelson Van Alden, again great fun watching this guy snap. Eli, we hope these brother issues get resolved. Arnold Rothstein, unsinkable. Chalky, love him, love him. Eddie Kessler, wow, he steals the show. Gillian, out to outsmart everybody. Richard Harrow, on a mission-quest and we finally get to see how handsome he is. Daughter Maitland, what a breath of fresh air, great voice, gorgeous close-ups. Sally Wheet, a real sweetheart who can throw a punch (played by a favorite actress who I didn't recognize until she smiled). Willie, potential rising star within the family. Bill McCoy, a rum runner worth Googling to read about his incredible career. Knox, utterly hateful with no redeeming qualities, hope a piano falls on his head.

I'm here to write a review on the BOX SET itself, not the show content. I pretty disappointed with the packaging of this season and it's a huge bummer that the DVD version isn't included as well. I've bought every season and the 1st 3 seasons come in this very sturdy/durable box. They also have the DVD version included as well with the Blu ray/digital download (except season 1 though) They look fantastic and are well made. The 4th season however is really a cheap slip cover and the actaul disc case is cheap to :-(. It's not the biggest gripe and it doesn't reflect the content of the amazing show, but it just kind of bummed me out cause i absolutely love Boardwalk and the box sets are so cool! Just the 4th season box is cheaply made compared to the previous three. Which leads me to believe the season 5 box set will be made cheaply like this one. Either way, if you haven't seen this show, please check it out. I've watched this show over and over again and cannot get tired of it.

5985757,3,B00FEP9PQG,"This is by far the worst of the 4 seasons but had some memorable moments.

Cons: SPOILER

Chalky goes to assassinate Narcisse.  Him and his crew opens fire on the Dr and, rather then checking if their target has been hit, they tuck their guns back in, act all smug, and turn around assuming everything went as planned.  After one failed assassination attempt, Chalky goes on the run for no apparent reason.  Worst, he leaves behind his family, money, and most importantly, his body guards.  I've always thought to myself, shouldn't it be DR who is on the run?  Regardless, skipping town after one failed attempt and leaving everything behind was terrible writing.

Eli and his Son:  Just as stupid as Chalkys script was Eli and his son.  Eli turn informant over his sons stupid case.  Please!!!  If this really did happen, the best person to turn to for help is Nucky.  Wil (Eli's son) would have been on the next train out of town (vacation) for the next few months.  Then, Wil's colleague (witness) would have mysteriously hung himself in his jail cell and the case would have been closed.  This has happened repeatedly in the old days of organized crime.  Eli flipping over his sons stupid case was the dumbest and most desperate script writing I had ever seen.

Gillian:  Now the script is really looking stupid:  After her confession to her new lover about murder, three mysterious men pop out of the closet and claim themselves witness to her confession.  Really?????  who the F@@@ wrote this script?  I enjoyed her story all the way up to the ending.  Then, like Eli and Chalky's script, the conclusion seem so desperate.

Richard Harrow:  Now I know this character is everyones favorite and I am no exception.  Chalky hires Harrow to assassinate Narcisse.  Rather than just snipping him or simply gunning him down face to face in a parking lot Harrow decides the best option is to snipe him off in the club.  I can understand this being done for famous and powerful people like Hitler because the options are limited but Narcisse????  Just gun him down in the parking lot.  Sniping him in such a small place is impractical and unrealistic.

PROS:
In all honesty, I felt the Atlantic City script for this season was just terrible.  However, the Chicago and New York stories were very well filmed and written.  If AC was just half as good I would have been satisfied.",1407456000,4,2373,4.668280871670702

5985759,3,B00FEP9PQG,"This is the worst season in my opinion of Boardwalk Empire so far. It has a lot of focus on Chalky and a Dr. Narcise as well as ex agent Alden and James' mother Gillian...all my least favorite characters. I wish more time would have been giving to O Bannon and Lucky Luciano...also the time giving to Margaret seems to be going nowhere in her interactions with Rothstein. Capone's role is good but also limited to fit in Chalky, Narsise, Gillian, and Alden. Also, Harrow the shows most feeling-less killer losses his nerve all of a sudden which also is a let down, as well as Eli turning on Nucky, yet again. I also didn't care too much for Eli's son's role in this episode. Heck even Nucky had a limited role in this season...They shouldn't have killed of James Darmody, the series seems to be running out of star actors. Season 1,2 and 3 were far better in my opinion, but I still want to see season 5 in hopes that they can redeem themselves for a down season and unlike the other seasons there wasn't really a climax to season 4.",1406332800,7,1033,4.357512953367876

Nothing exciting happens throughout the entire season.  It's got way too many characters which jump around from one another every episode with nothing important going on.  Even when I thought the ending could redeem the season it made it far worse.  I place all the blame on the writing for just missing this season.  Steve Buscemi and the other actors are phenomenal as usual, the costumes and period settings continue to impress.

This show is great to watch, I love the era and style this show presents. It is however, Not the best season. I think they really shot themselves in the foot by killing off Jimmy so early. I understand why they did it, but he had so much to offer to the show. And now they have really done it with killing off Richard as well. But I think this season was not as good, because they are building up for their 5th and final season. Laying the ground work for what is to come type deal. I will say however, that I loved seeing Nelson show his true colors. His scenes were definitely some of my favorites. I was not a fan of the Gillian Darmody story line, it made sense as the show wrapped up, but was not all that fun to watch throughout. Still a great show, Not at its best, but definitely worth watching and buying!",1391385600,3,837,4.134969325153374
5985768,5,B00FEP9PQG,"I don't know how this show does it but it rises to excellence every year and still remains new and fresh. That means a solid cast of core characters played by great actors(although we sometimes have to say goodbye to favorites) and a fresh crop of new faces adding more depth to the story. The production value is epic music wardrobe and sets trap rating you to the roaring twenties. This season that is even more true with the Onyx club and the jazz age taking center stage, in fact it is almost a main character in itself. Here is where we meet a vivid new character Margot Bingham plays daughter Maitland a beautiful mysterious chanteuse at the club. Her acting is phenomenal and her performances and singing on stage are beyond top notch. She really recreates the excitement of the era. She share an ambiguous and close relationship with Dr. Valentine Narcisse who is a drug dealer and thug in the disguise of a community activist.
It is 1924 and Nucky is lying ole at an empty hotel on the shore. He is busy brokering a peace agreement between Masseria and Rothstein. The mysterious Richard, played so well by Jack Huston, arrives in town to hide out with his sister leaving another trail of dead bodies in his wake. Lucky's brother Eli is having family problems. His oldest son gets into big trouble at his Ivy League college and returns home wanting to join the family business which is fine with uncle Nucky, but which his father is dead set against. Gillian is a down and out heroin addict reduced to turning tricks while she fights for custody of her grandson. Seemingly, her knight in shining armor appears but who is he really? All of these characters and more have their compelling stories woven into what is an intense, highly watchable drama that is addicting, it is so good.",1390435200,40,1790,4.596875
5985769,5,B00FEP9PQG,"I will first admit that I am somewhat biased as I loved the first three seasons.  This season was solid.  I will admit I started to worry during the middle of the season.  Especially the plot line with Eli's son (Will).  But it was an excellent slow build and unlike the previous seasons, should seep into season five.  It makes me wonder if this is intentional and if season 5 will be the last.  I am going to give it five stars just because the pay off of the last three shows. Might be the best sequece of the whole series.  Of course bitter sweet for obvious reasons.

5985773,5,B00FEP9PQG,"BOARDWALK EMPIRE's 4th season adds even more brutal violence (yes, it was possible) and brilliant character-study with several supporting cast dominating screen-time (Chalky, Agent Jim, Mr. Purnsley, Will Thompson and the twitchy Dr. Narcisse).  Even so, Steve Buscemi remains the #1 reason to follow the show religiously.  Lots of fun time is spent in Florida and, of course, in Chicago focusing on the rise of Al Capone (A role and accent mastered by British actor, Stephen Graham).

Overall, the finest gift of the EMPIRE is its dedication to realistic-fiction with spot-on set-pieces, costumes and exquisite jazz along with our anti-heroes believable story-lines over the years.
