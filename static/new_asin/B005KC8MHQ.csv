8476716,5,B005KC8MHQ,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like TNA, ROH, DragonGate, and NWA.  This is the second night of a two night event called ""All-Star Reunion 8"" which is one of their biggest events of the year as they try to load up the card with the biggest names available leading to various dream matches & reunions but the big story going into this event was that this would be the last regular appearance of Akira Tozawa in P.W.G. so it was his farewell show.

The main event for this show was for the P.W.G. Championship as Claudio Castagnoli went against Low-Ki (Senshi in TNA/Kaval in WWE) in a match where it looked like ""David vs. Goliath"" just based off their looks but was very technical between both men as both men have a ""strong"" style that mixed well together.  The P.W.G. Tag Team Championships were also defended as The Young Bucks (once again going under their TNA Wrestling gimmick of ""Generation Me"") went against Generation Next who had a score to settle based off the Bucks jumping them the night before after their match in a match that started off wild as they brawled through the crowd into both bathrooms.  Tozawa teamed again with Kevin Steen to face off against the RockNES Monsters who had a grudge against Steen & targeted him right away leading to a very competitive match that saw Johnny Yuma taking so much punishment to his head & neck that it made me cringe at times...however Tozawa would also get a bonus farewell match against Chris Hero in a battle of size & strength (Hero) vs. speed & impact (Tozawa).  Other matches include Eddie Edwards vs. El Generico in their first singles meeting in P.W.G., Kenny King vs. Brian Cage-Taylor, Willie Mack vs. Ricochet, and The Dynasty (Joey Ryan & Scorpio Sky) vs. Cutler Brothers.

While I enjoyed the action of night one better, this was still quality wrestling that was enjoyable from top to bottom.",1333756800,,2087,4.735537190082645
