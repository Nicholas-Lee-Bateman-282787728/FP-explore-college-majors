It's a good old-fashion story with a ""superhero grandpa."" I'd like
to seem more adventures with grandpa as the star and hero, neat idea.
My grandchildren are the right age for this kind of wholesome fun:

Synopsis:
Jeremiah Wilson is truly the Train Master of Williamette Western Railroad. He lives, breaths and eats railroad. When Brett Banner, the heir to New York Eastern, talks his dad into purchasing Williamette Western, there is immediately a clash between himself and Jeremiah. Jeremiah is fired by Brett two years from retirement and turns into an angry, depressed grandfather. When Brett's nine-year-old son, Justin, realizes Jeremiah's grandson, Thomas, can drive a locomotive, he kidnaps and holds Thomas' favorite dinosaur for ransom. Justin, Thomas and three other children board an old engine in for repairs and accidentally turn it into a runaway engine causing a chain reaction of events.

Dove Worldview:
Jeremiah Wilson is the ""Train master"" of Willamette Western Railroad In Willamette, Oregon. The New York Eastern Railroad and Brett Banner make a deal to buy the WWRR. Brett assures the owner he will not let any employees go and will treat them fairly. With this new transaction the two men's families become intertwined because of the railroad.
Brett and his son, Justin, move to Willamette with a very arrogant and superior attitude. Justin must attend the same school as Jeremiah's grandchildren, Sara and Thomas. Together the three children get into some serious trouble that forces Brett and Jeremiah to work together to save the kids.

The children in this movie along with the viewers learn many lessons such as the importance of listening to the adults and staying out of trouble. Also, that being sly and conniving brings nothing good and tends to hurt others. Also the important lesson that honesty and kindness can take you further than stealing and bad behavior.

This DVD has suspense and action that the entire family will enjoy. This movie has been happily awarded our Dove ""Family-Approved"" Seal.

3802227,5,B001UIXZW6,"This is a great movie to have on DVD. The film is well made and enjoyable to watch. The story follows young children and their adventure with trains, so kids can relate to the film. Well worth the money.",1236902400,,203,4.230769230769231
3802228,5,B001UIXZW6,"This is a great family film.  Produced and filmed in the beautiful State of Oregon.  My two kids loved it, we saw it on the big screen in Portland.  Its well worth the money.",1236816000,,174,4.0588235294117645
3802229,4,B001UIXZW6,"Saw this in a theater in Portland. It's an Indie film with limited release, so this may be the only way for many people to see it. The kids are great, and this is a great kid film. Exciting, and just scarey enough to pay off at the end.",1236729600,5,236,3.836734693877551
8344005,5,B001UIXZW6,Its a very enjoyable and family orientated movie.  We watch it regularly and my 10 year old grandson loves it.,1525564800,,110,4.5
8344006,4,B001UIXZW6,Good Kids movie,1431648000,,15,4.333333333333333
8344007,5,B001UIXZW6,"My grandson age 7 loves this movie. He has it memerized.......Watched it ""lots"" of times. Good learning tool for children.",1419984000,,122,5.15
8344008,5,B001UIXZW6,"Cute little story.  Parts of this were filmed inside of my mother-in-laws house in West Linn, Oregon.",1419292800,,101,4.9411764705882355
8344009,1,B001UIXZW6,"As far as this being for kids, there is no doubt that is who the target audience was. While troubling to see the complete inaccuracies of railroad operations, and the outright portrayal of everyone at the railroad being a moron except the ""Train Master;"" the story of the loss of the directors son is very sad to hear. However, I believe the portrayal of kids getting on to railroad equipment and being on a runaway train is irresponsible. If anyone lets there kids watch this movie, there must be a serious talk about railroad safety before and after. In other words, stay away from the tracks and the equipment unless you work for the railroad!",1377129600,,646,4.626086956521739
8344010,1,B001UIXZW6,"OMG this is THE worst acting I have ever witnessed in a feature film. The screen play is worse than the acting. The cinematography however is shot well and my 6 year old wanted to continue to watch it. He also enjoys bologna sandwiches. This is one of those films an adult will not be able to sit through but the kids seem to love it. If you see it in the 3.99 bin buy it, put it on and leave kids to enjoy it solo. I know this This an independent film but there is a reason good writers and actors need to be in feature films. Yeah! Its over now!",1374364800,,547,3.892857142857143
8344011,4,B001UIXZW6,"This is a fascinating movie I'd never heard of until I stumbled across it in the clearance bin of a local grocery store, which is a bit too bad.  Though less than perfect it deserves a better fate than this.

As other reviewers have noted, the best parts of this movie are the gorgeous shots of railroading: HO, live steam, and 1:1 i.e. the Real Thing.  Trainiacs (and you know who you are!) should probably just go ahead and add a star for that alone!  It is the acting and perhaps the writing and directing that is not quite up to snuff IMHO.

To begin with, there seems to be a real disconnect between various parts of the movie.  The allegedly humorous,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Macgyver/dp/B000SQFC2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Macgyver</a>-ed up, and somewhat dumbed-down kid's antics don't really fit too well with the drama and high tension of the adult antics.  Whether out of a desire not to scare kid viewers or the kid actors themselves, special effort appears to have been made to drain all but the very last kid scenes of any sense of tension or danger, which thoroughly un-suspends disbelief.  As long as the kids aren't worried about being trapped on a runaway train, why should the viewer be?

Second, the adult acting is something of a mismatch as well.  The villain is portrayed as such a one-note force of evil that his final change of heart, motivated by his to this point never expressed love for his son, doesn't ring true.  In contrast the Grandfather is portrayed as such an insubordinate old cuss that even a non-evil-incarnate new boss might have been compelled to fire him, and his response to being fired is so selfish and self-centered as to make him largely to blame for provoking the events of the ensuing near tragedy.  Trouble is, none of this is acknowledged in the movie, which seems to suggest that only Brett Banner is in need of a repentance it is impossible to see him capable of.

Still, there's no denying the potential here, and no movie chock full of trains can be all bad.  I shall be watching for Train Master II.",1328918400,,2109,4.822222222222222
8344012,5,B001UIXZW6,"This is an excellent movie. it is one of best movies I have seen in a long time. if you have grandkids please watch it with them. I like the storyline, and its a great, clean movie that anybody can enjoy.",1321574400,,204,4.0
8344013,3,B001UIXZW6,"This movie is beautifully shot, great for train fans and kids, but the over-the-top, badly acted bad guys distracted me from an otherwise great kids train movie.  Perhaps because it's intended for kids, the villian is over-the-top mean and unbelievable, and so is his kid.  Other than these two actors the rest of the acting is fairly good.

What does take your breath away is the cinematography: the detailed views of train equipment, tracks, Pacific Northwest scenery, and even live steam model railroads.  The swing bridge operator is a good comic relief from the suspense and was very cleverly shot, too.

One odd element in the movie made me squirm a little in my seat.  The story ends about ten minutes before the movie actually ends.  It's worth it for the live steam model railroad shots, but the lack of dialog in the cheesy montage was rather odd.

I highly recommend this movie especially for train fans.",1274313600,,915,4.7834394904458595
8344014,4,B001UIXZW6,"This movie was shot here in the Northwest by a Northwest director. The model railroad scenes were shot at the Columbia Gorge Model Railroad Club with which I am very familiar. So I had to get a copy when I learned about it. One of the members of my own model railroad club (Catlin Gabel Model Railroad Club) watched it and did not really care for it, however, I viewed it a few days later and enjoyed it.
It was a bit clunky and some of the acting was not star quality, but the story was entertaining and watching the trains running here locally was fun. I especially enjoyed the camera work done at the model railroad. It showed off the club layout very well. I am quite familiar with this layout which is over 4,200 square feet and was interested in how they would portray it in what I presume was to be a smaller space. They did a fine job.
I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys railroading, either the 1:1 prototype or the models. Kids will especially like it because kids are the lead characters.
The seller shipped right away and I had no problems with the video.",1262822400,6,1075,4.326732673267327
