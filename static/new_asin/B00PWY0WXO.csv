6824811,5,B00PWY0WXO,"This movie was a most pleasant surprise. I can't remember enjoying a movie with actors that were completely new to me so much. I am very much interested in the Civil War, but this movie is not so much about the war, but the sadder side effects of slavery. The creators of this movie should be highly rewarded for their creativity, and guts to show a part of American life that most people would like to avoid even thinking about. It is still hard to believe that this shameful way of living (if you could call it that) was allowed to even exist in the ""land of the free"". This movie is time and a small amount of money well spent.",1419379200,13,630,4.214876033057851
6824812,5,B00PWY0WXO,The performances are extraordinary.  A haunting rendering of conflicting emotions.  This film will stay with you for a very long while.,1418083200,9,135,5.380952380952381
6824813,5,B00PWY0WXO,"Near the end of the Civil War, a cynical African American man, Marcus (Keston John), and his adolescent nephew Will (Ashton Sanders) are in league with slave-pursuing bounty hunters.  As the film The Retrieval begins, they are sent north alone to find Nate (Tishuan Scott), a quietly enigmatic man with a particularly large price on his head; the lead bounty hunter threatens Marcus and Will's lives if they fail to return with Nate.  On the road, however, loyalties are tested and unexpected friendships formed, resulting in a life-changing (and, for the audience, very suspenseful) moral conundrum for the youthful-but-not-naive Will.  This is a small film, but a very fine one in almost every way.  It is a fresh variation on the Civil War picture not only because it is a rare example of the sub-genre told from an African American perspective, but also because it unfolds on quiet country lanes and in the forest as the war rages nearby.  Actual combat only erupts now and then into the central drama, but its haunting specter is always present.  The trio of stars are splendid.  As the adult men, Scott and John both convey the soul-burdening exhaustion and pain acquired over the course of hard lives within claustrophobic and often brutal racial constriction, yet they are a study in contrast in regard to the way they cope and treat others.  If the film itself had a higher profile, I suspect Scott might be part of the Oscar conversation as a best-actor contender.  And Sanders delivers a performance free of child-actor artifice, quietly illustrating the formation of his character's worldview as he matures over the course of the dangerous journey.",1416787200,28,1660,4.963898916967509

6824822,5,B00PWY0WXO,"Excellent film. Great acting. Wonderful, but sad story of slavery.
A terrible time in American History. My Great-Grandmother was born
in 1865 at the end of the war. Her parents lived in Virginia and
owner two slaves. A man and a woman. The man left, but the lady
stayed. She had no family. It was wrong, but they lived there
like they were part of the family. They all sat down at the same table and had dinner.
My Great-Grandmother said it was like having two mothers. She told me a lot of stories.
I was 12 when she passed. It's hard to believe that I have such a close connection to slavery.",1503792000,,594,4.265486725663717
6824823,5,B00PWY0WXO,"This 4th of July I was searching Amazon Prime for a story of America. I found this. The story of a young African-American boy (approximate age 12-14?) forced to do something terrible against his will, set in 1864, in a slave holding state in the American South. I felt I had seen something special, and truthful. It was almost overwhelming. Almost perverse. It was like a Biblical trial. Job against God or something like that. This film deserves far more publicity than it has gotten. Good moody cinematography, and realistic acting. Reminiscent of ""Cold Mountain"" or ""The VVich"" -- that kind of moodiness. No spooky stuff, only a hard lesson learned by a young man. A very transparent, and truthful story. Be prepared to feel something!",1499212800,4,738,4.865079365079365
6824824,3,B00PWY0WXO,"The movie was ok. It was done well, and the actors did a good job. I don't understand all the 5 star ratings. It doesn't have much to do with the civil war. It was slow, not much of a story line. Reading some of the reviews after watching it, I think I was suppose to feel some kind of white guilt, because some blacks in the past sold out other blacks for money, and somehow it was the white mans fault that the black man was just as or more greedy than the white man. I would like to know how this was based on a true story. I do not see the boy knowing how to read or write, to be able to write this story. History already shows that there was black and white bounty hunters, and that is what the boy and his uncle were.",1494547200,4,723,3.859060402684564

6824831,4,B00PWY0WXO,"Set in the back half of the Civil War, The Retrieval follows two African Americans, a young boy Will (Ashton Saunders) and his uncle Marcus (Keston John), as they are tasked to recover a bounty on a former slave who now works for the Union army. Although themselves victims of slavery, Will and Marcus work for a group of bounty hunters roaming the war ravaged countryside and recapturing former slaves. In the first scene of the film, Will is taken in by a house on the underground railroad, and shortly after he is given shelter in a shed with other escaping slaves, he immediately provides their location to Burrell (Bill Oberst Jr.), the alpha male of the slave hunters.

Burrell learns of a hefty bounty on Nate (Tishuan Scott), a former slave in the employ of the Union, and while it would be difficult for Burrell and his bounty hunters to venture north, Will and Marcuss blackness allow them to enter Union territory. Will and Marcus find Nate digging soldiers graves and lure him back south by claiming his brother is sick and dying and offer to accompany him along his travels. Nate doesnt know that his brother is already dead.

No major studio would even glance at a film like The Retrieval, which is an intimate film by design and, likely, budget. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the film for the studio to wrap their heads around is the blurring of racial lines of power and oppression.  Will and Marcus are implicated within the institution of slavery despite the fact that they are also its victims, a situation that is reminiscent Edward P. Joness novel, The Known World, which depicts the seemingly unlikely situation of a southern black who owns black slaves. (But, of course, blacks owning black slaves is a historical fact).

Im sympathetic to those who are uncomfortable with stories that examine ways in which blacks were used to buttress slavery, especially since even in the 21st century we have barely come to terms with white culpability in slavery. White supremacists have long pointed to black slave owners as a means to elide the simple fact that the institution of slavery was built by and for the benefit of whites. But the film attempts to address these tricky reversals. Marcus, who is presented as brash and aggressive, repeatedly refers to the outsized bounty on Nates head, which will be shared by him and Will. But, for extra measure, Burrell threatens the life of Marcus and his entire family if he decides he wants to stay up North.

No more than thirteen-years-old, Will easily garners the audiences sympathies. Because of his age, Will is both more beholden to the forces of slavery and capable of escaping it, at least once the war is over. The Retrieval reminds viewers that slavery itself was beholden to the marketplace, a means to unjustly enrich others through forced labor, torture, and rape. At one point, Marcus reminds Nate of their bare economic subsistence prior to working with Burrell and his men. And Burrell, who is of course a racist himself, is able to briefly put aside his white supremacy in order to prevent one of his men from irrevocably harming the lost property. But because the war is nearly over, this property and all the violence Burrell and his men employ capturing escaped slaves is meaningless and unnecessary. The institution of slavery is lost, even if they don't know it.

The films dramatic center hinges on the whether in the end Will is going to bring Nate to Burrell, a question from which the film wrings plenty of suspense, despite its subtle visual approach. The relationship between Will and Nate grows as the film progresses, and in Will, Nate sees the possibilities of a life he was never allowed to fully live. Towards the end of the film, Will convinces Nate to see his former wife (in practice if not in fact, since slaves were not allowed to legally marry). Nate had long ago meant to return and buy his wifes freedom before circumstances got the best of him. Unsurprisingly, the reunion isn't exactly joyous. But the scene offers a glimpse a life denied.

[From here on, there are some spoilers]

Director Chris Eska and cinematographer Yasu Tanida paint a bleak landscape drained of color. Much of the film  appears bathed in morning fog, which can be equally menacing and beautiful. The film takes place in the winter of 1864, and the barren trees speak more powerfully of the Civil Wars violence than the brief glimpses of battles, but they also signify the death of antebellum America. We know that this death precedes the beginning of a necessary transformation of the nation. In the final shot of the film, Will returns to Nates wife and her new husband, an image that suggests that despite white supremacys attempt to sever black bonds, the black family survives, reassembled in unique ways.

The Retrieval was given a small release and earned only $50,000 in its theatrical run. (Its now streaming on Netflix). But I think its a necessary addition to a recent spate of 21st-century films that examine slavery and the Civil War. Alongside discussions of Lincoln, 12 Years a Slave, and Django Unchained, we must make room for The Retrieval when thinking of how the present attempts to make sense of the past.",1440115200,3,5211,4.78

6824834,5,B00PWY0WXO,"A great movie by a young director.  Set in the backdrop of the Civil War, it follows the story of bounty hunters who track down runaway slaves and wanted fugitives.  Superb acting, script, and camera work.  Seems realistic and not overly dramatic.  Beautifully filmed.

The story and characters can be placed in any war and any system of injustice.  This is a move about personal morality, survival, hope, redemption, and coming of age... developing into oneself.  I can't say that the bounty hunters are evil people, but amoral opportunistic people working within an immoral and unjust system.  Are most people who go along with evil systems really evil people?  Does such a system such as slavery survive purely because of evil people?

In the background are the sounds of cannon fire and the characters are caught in the middle of a fight between Union and Confederate soldiers.  As they walk through the battlefield strewn with those who have died in war, you can't help to wonder if, even for a moment, they stopped to think about the grander picture of what is happening in America at that time.  Nate when asked why he worked for the Union army, replied he dug graves for them for the good pay and for the fact that he can just leave his job like he did.  If he was in the South, he probably would not have had the freedom to just leave.  Marcus and Will work in the South . I would not consider them ""slaves"" afraid of their ""master"".  Was Marcus really that afraid of the bounty hunter Burrell finding them if they bailed on their task or was he thinking also about his big pay day, his cut of the bounty?  They were paid for their services.  These are ordinary people making extraordinary choices.

The two main characters, Will and Nate, each face their own moral issues/questions.  For Will, he questions whether he should turn Nate into the bounty hunter as he was trained and paid to do.  As his uncle Marcus told him it's about money and survival.  Should Nate visit his dying brother and the girlfriend he left behind?  It's too late for Will to save Nate... it is only at the very end that he warns him.  For Nate, his brother was already dead and his woman, who has given up on his return to free her, has found another man.  He leaves her behind at the plantation.  Both characters have some small form of personal redemption in the end.  Their stories reflect the choices people face both everyday and during extraordinary times at any point in history.",1433721600,,2473,4.5636363636363635

6824841,4,B00PWY0WXO,"History is not my best subject.  I hated it in school.  In fact, I got in trouble a lot for goofing off and making fun of history.  It was also so stuffy and boring and just uninteresting to me.  As Ive gotten older, and now that I have children (who I also home school), history has come back to haunt me.  It has become this thorn in my side, as I attempt to try and teach something Im having to learn myself.

Pay attention in school kids!

Anyways, there is some history that we aren't taught, sadly, and in films like The Retrieval, we are given a chance to learn something we may have completely taken for granted.  Slavery isn't an unfamiliar subject, not in the least, and film tends to attempt to depict it in various forms time after time, but some aspects of slavery, the grittier, more awful aspects, are often avoided.  Most films on the subject focus on the liberation of slavery; the eventual abolishment or the fight for freedom, but rarely does a film dwell within the realm of slavery and stay there.

In Chris Eskas The Retrieval, there is no liberation, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, there is just that looming feeling of inevitable injustice.

The Retrieval takes place during the Civil War and centers on a young black boy working alongside his uncle for a group of white bounty hunters, earning the trust of runaway slaves and then turning them in for money.  Will is thirteen and still developing a conscience, while his uncle, Marcus, has already lost his.  Marcus and Will are tasked with their largest assignment, and most profitable, when they are asked to find a man named Nate and bring him back to their boss.  Things are different this time, though, and when Will discovers that Nate is not a runaway slave, but actually a free man, his conscience starts to rattle him.  Once Marcus is out of the picture, and the boy finds himself escorting Nate into dangerous hands (after earning his trust, based on a lie), he begins to battle his inner emotions and sense of morality as he bonds with the man.

Eskas tale is a simple yet ambitious one, for it plunges us into a complex and controversial chapter of American history.  It forces us to contemplate the actions of a confused young man, just trying to survive, and the moral dilemma hes placed into.  Slavery is such a disgusting stain on a history rich with stains, but this story focuses less on the white mans part and more on the moral conundrum some black men and women were faced with.

He handles this subject with grace and clarity.

The Retrieval is a beautifully shot and constructed film, with some brilliant performances by the two leads.  Ashton Sanders carries the weight of his youth and struggle so well, his eyes bleeding for some answers, and Tishuan Scott is a marvel as a man weighted down by his past and his decision to move forward, even though it caused him to lose everything.  I was not all that taken by Keston Johns portrayal of Marcus, which felt clich&eacute;d and uninspired, but his presence is forgotten the moment hes gone.  The film is also stunning to look at, with such breathtaking scenery captured by Yasu Tanida.

If I were to fault the film anything, it would be that it tends to linger in moments, and while the film is only 92 minutes, there were many moments I felt could have been tightened to deliver a more impactful (overall) experience.  In fact, I feel like all of the emotion and events captured could have been edited down to a short film and carried the same impact, maybe even more so, but that is just my personal opinion.

Still, The Retrieval offers a look at a moment in American history we may have never given attention to, and because of that it deserves to be seen.",1423180800,8,3723,4.519402985074627
