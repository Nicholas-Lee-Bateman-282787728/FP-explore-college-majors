8320941,5,B001MBTSD6,"It's quite wonderful to see Michael Harrington, after having published ""The Other America,"" with Buckley on Firing Line.  Harrington is considered by many to be one of the few who could ""beat"" Buckley in a debate -- I think that Al Shanker is considered to be the other -- and Harrington certainly makes one good point after the other while Buckley seems almost morosely, and almost exclusively, concerned about the poor ethics of persons in poverty, as if it's a problem of moral fiber and not that of income, rotten housing, and hunger.  Actually, the debate seems kind of modern ...",1443139200,,585,4.782178217821782
8320942,5,B001MBTSD6,"This is a vintage (1966)debate over poverty with opposing points of view engaged by William F. Buckley, Jr. clearly representing The Establishment. Michael Harrington, his factually well-armed adversary (as David here) does exceptionally well in close quarters. Although Buckley first opines in an early thrust that this early war on poverty was a Colossus in Washington, Mr. Harrington deflects the attack with established facts and figures. The Yankee Buckley's disbelief about southern poverty, or that it exists at all, seems more than racially motivated here. Although black-and-white vintage, Buckley is respectfully generous to Mr. Harrington allowing him to frame his arguments without interference, perhaps a show of Catholicity. It is surprising though, how uncharitable he can be toward this subject leaving Mr. Harrington as the sole defender. Most of the debate is spent on the necessity of continuing government involvement at all with both participants locking horns whether the war is corporate-backed or government welfare. The closing minutes allowing thoughtful questions from the middle-aged participants to the standing adversaries was very interesting, allowing both to clarify dengling lines of argument. I wish Mr. Harrington had the sense to ask the Catholic Mr. Buckley why he allowed so much charity toward military engagements rather than poverty programs? Mr. Buckley likened federal spending on poverty to borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. So, how is that different to dropping 50,000 tons of bombs on the Vietman landscape for no effect? We will never know such questions. But this is a good primer on our early war on poverty. Mr. Harrington, continues his lone quest in publication to this day, a champion of the underdog. In his closing remarks on the broadcast regarding Michael Harrington Mr. Buckley's christianity does show itself. Again, this is Buckley in high form with an equal adversary.

A good companion Firing Line to this would be to follow-up with John Kenneth Galbraith's guest appearances.",1330300800,2,2039,5.4525316455696204
8320943,5,B001MBTSD6,"A great discussion about a serious topic. We dont't get this kind of discourse anymore - and we are lesser for it.

Buckley and Harrington talk about poverty, government effectiveness in helping the poor, free enterprise versus socialism...etc.

Good stuff.",1279152000,6,257,5.4
