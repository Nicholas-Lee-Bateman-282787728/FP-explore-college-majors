I do agree with some of the other review above, It's not all live and it is a bit dark in places, but not so dark that I had a problem with it, I really had to go back and look at it again before I noticed it. The DVD is missing two tracks as stated, #16-Kalimba De Luna and #17-Night Flight To Venus, so there are only 19 tracks instead of the 21 listed in the box's track list.
Overall I was happy with the DVD and was happy I bought it because I'd never seen anything more of Boney M other than the pictures on their CD's. It's fun to find this old/new disco music and video from the seventies, we missed so much good music here in the US because all the radio stations played every ten minutes for a year was ""Staying Alive"", and they totally ignored everything from Europe. Maybe the US was the center of the disco craze, but we missed so much great music and Boney M is a perfect example of what we missed, great music with a beat that makes you want to get up and dance.",1188172800,4,1208,4.10126582278481
