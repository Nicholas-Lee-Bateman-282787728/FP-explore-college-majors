6602687,5,B00MW0CI0G,"What more can you say but Bronson when it comes to classic action? I probably can't tell you anything you don't know about these movies if you're reading this, but I do have one important piece of information-this is a THREE blu-ray set, not the single disc listed in the description! I was hesitant to pick this up because I thought all three movies would be compressed onto one blu, but I'm glad I took the chance. Sure, the uncut version of Death Wish 2 is not here and the extras are shameful (that is to say non-existent), BUT you are getting three classic 80's Bronson Death Wish movies for a very reasonable price, each on their own disc. Very glad I purchased this one!",1415664000,24,677,4.424

6602695,5,B00MW0CI0G,"This is a ""Bronson Collection"" but it's just 3 of the Death Wish sequels - not that that's a bad thing. An increasingly geriatric Bronson goes on less- and less-probable shooting sprees, motivated by his perpetually violated family.",1522281600,,232,5.131578947368421

6602702,3,B00MW0CI0G,"First:  The original Death Wish is not included in the set.  As this is possibly the best of the series and the start of the story not having it included is a major problem for me.
Second: The last and by some the worst is not included or even on Blu-ray.
The three movies included are good solid stories for the series.
There are many references to the first film in the first movie of the set and a few in the other two.
Motivation and family become less important as the shoot em up takes over.
I question the utility of this set unless you own the first film already and do not want to wait for the full set on Blu-ray.",1509840000,2,623,4.056910569105691
6602703,4,B00MW0CI0G,"I liked this Blu-Ray set. The only downfall is in Deathwish 4 though, it is one of those movies where you find yourself adjusting the volume up and down, because it fluctuates from scene to scene. I have no other problems with this item.",1498089600,4,237,4.409090909090909

6602706,5,B00MW0CI0G,2 is serious; 3 & 4 more like comedies and a lot of fun. Great value and the best $ I spent all year.,1473724800,3,101,3.25
6602707,4,B00MW0CI0G,I like the movies but I don't think the quality of the blu ray is top notch. In dark scenes it is very grainy. The scenes with light are ok. I also bought the dvd version of the original Death Wish and find it to be no worse than the blu-rays.  So if you can get the dvds cheaper I would. Up conversion players do a good job.,1471392000,11,325,3.7794117647058822
6602708,2,B00MW0CI0G,"Death Wish set Rules, however this blu-ray is not a good copy! At least not with my newer Samsung player! While parts of this are good other have white noise badly! The first one was excellent, keep in mind please!",1469318400,,214,4.375

I had never seen all the death wish movies before except for the first one. If you're concerned about what your little kids watch I'd put them on to beddie bye before viewing any of these movies. They pull no punches, believe me.",1468800000,,363,4.6

6602713,5,B00MW0CI0G,I like all four movies and I also have the first Death wish 4 I never seen I think that one is the best one of all and the ending has a great plot twist If you are into  the Death Wish franchise just for DEATH WISH 4 is worth the cost the HD picture and sound is great stuff no surround sound two channel mono back in the 1970's and part of the 1980's Hollywood was not into big sound on all movie like today CHECK THEM OUT GUYS,1463443200,3,428,3.7555555555555555

""Death Wish II"" is the best of the three by far, though a pity Part V(with another company) is not here, and still not on Blu-ray either.",1432512000,3,277,4.12962962962963

6602731,5,B00MW0CI0G,Great 3 movie collection on Blu-ray. All 3 movies look great on blu ray. If you already have them individually then you don't need this as there is nothing new here but if you don't then pick this set up. Death Wish 2 is my favorite.,1425772800,5,233,4.086956521739131
6602732,5,B00MW0CI0G,"Well, what can you say about a man that has a broad career as an actor? I first saw him in ""House Of Wax 3D"" with Vincent Price and ""The Magnificent Seven"" as one of the defenders and thought he was great. In came the 1970s. With mostly action/drama to his name, he ventured to do one movie that would end up being a series of vigilante style flicks that continued with his every move to a different city. I loved them all and most were done in the 1980s. Death Wish part 1, which is sold separately as the 40th Anniversary Edition, was made in 1974. Here we have 3 of the sequels nicely packaged together in Hi-Definition Widescreen. They look good and the sound is DTS-HD, but I would have liked a 5.1 mix.
Look for Jeff Goldblum and Lawrence Fishburne as thugs in part 2.
Part 3, where he is in NY, look for actress Marina Sirtis of Star Trek: The Next Generation completely topless.
Part 4, the actor who played Tuvok in Star Trek: Voyager plays a shammy drug dealer and a few other familiar faces like that of the Asian Detective who played in at least two Chuck Norris movies ""Missing In Action 2:The Beginning"" and ""Good Guys Wear Black"".
Actress Shelley Hack who was Bronson's Girlfriend in 4, was a ""Charlie's Angel"" in the original TV series of 5 seasons.
Heck, for the price I got this set for ($7.99) at a local retailer, I couldn't pass it up.
If you are a fan of Bronson's Death Wish movies, you should get this. Well worth the price for 3 Blu-ray movies of his in one package!",1425168000,2,1491,4.290780141843972

6602734,5,B00MW0CI0G,What can I say about the Death Wish movies. Classics and the quality on Blu-ray is excellent. I never tire of these movies. I'm so glad to finally find them on Blu-ray.,1422316800,3,168,4.28125
6602735,1,B00MW0CI0G,Stick with Clint Eastwood if your serious about fighting crime. B-rated junk. Seen old Dolomite movies with better action sequences.,1422230400,,132,5.65

8674931,1,B00MW0CI0G,DW2 was tolerable.  I got halfway through 3 and I understood why it was called Deathwish.  I'd rather shoot myself than watch anymore.  Bookmans now owns this set.  I exchanged it for Goodwill Hunting for the three discs.  They totally got cheated.  Don't buy this set.  The Original is worth watching however.,1529452800,2,310,4.846153846153846
