5572445,5,B00BC0JIM8,"Legend Films has put together this fantastic set of old classic commercials for you to enjoy and you will not be disappointed! These commercials were of course all produced before technology was as sophisticated as it is today, and times were more simple and innocent. Yes, cigarettes were promoted back in the olden days!! Too funny and some great celeb appearances too! 5 stars!!",1396137600,2,381,4.96875
5572446,5,B00BC0JIM8,"Wonderful collection which brings back memories from a time when, shortly after WW II the USA was on top of the world. The USA dominated everything back then, and our economy was booming.  These commercials show as much....ads for products which really helped build the economy. It was a happy time (1946-63), possibly the greatest era in USA history in all fields.",1375920000,6,365,4.887096774193548
5572447,5,B00BC0JIM8,"Some made me laugh when viewed decades later,
such as Reagan using Boraxo to wash off his dirty hands. LOL
Quality is very acceptable, and the extras, previews of other DVD's were also very entertaining.
Strictly for Baby Boomers.",1370736000,3,230,4.923076923076923
5572448,5,B00BC0JIM8,"These are classic commercials from the 50s, 60's, and early 70's that have new cars (for the time), toys, junk food, good for you food, and cigarettes, among other products hawked by celebrities to fuel America's conspicuous consumption. It's great fun to watch and remember when bad things were good for you!",1369440000,9,309,4.961538461538462
8565729,4,B00BC0JIM8,"This features mostly B/W era television commercials of some of the most famous stars to ever grace a screen for such products as vehicles, fuel, cigs, food, TOY GUNS!, and more. While watching it is surprising to see who will appear next. Sadly, most of the products no long exist so evidently the commercials did not create sales!",1527292800,,331,4.724137931034483

8565731,2,B00BC0JIM8,"Most of the commercials on this DVD are a blurry mess.  I have some of the same commercials I transferred from VHS tapes that were clearer then these.  Apparently, they used allot of video files that were downloaded from the internet archives in Mpeg 4 format for free and blew them up to DVD resolution (720x480) and believe me, it shows.  An example of this is the Kellogg's Sugar Corn Pops commercial, I already had from the VHS transfer and it is far clearer than the version on this DVD.  They could of did it the right way, the honest way and acquired them from the original films but they didn't.  They wanted to do it the easy, cheap way and profit from it.  This kind deception  is totally sickening.  Some good sound advise, DON'T BUT THIS DVD.",1446940800,4,754,4.413043478260869

8565738,4,B00BC0JIM8,"Nicely expanded DVD version of the 1987 video release ""Celebrity Commercials From TV's Golden Age."" Worth having for its diverse array of Hollywood hucksters  some more animated than others. Highlights include Boris Karloff ""experimenting"" with A.1. Steak Sauce, Humphrey Bogart's Lucky Strike jingle, and the lavish Great American Soup production featuring Ann Miller. The Sandy Oliveri compilation wouldn't be complete without the Flintstones puffing away on Winston cigarettes. A pop-culture time capsule from an era when TV commercials were fun to watch.",1400284800,4,558,5.804878048780488
