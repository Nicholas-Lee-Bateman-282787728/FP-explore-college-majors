7927252,2,B00004YKSO,Score by Nino Rota is very good. Rest of movie only adequate. Premise of the story is good. Working out of plot was heavy-handed.,1383782400,,129,4.416666666666667
7927253,3,B00004YKSO,"The plot line of The Glass Mountain is the typical English love triangle (minus one star for triteness). It reminded me of Brief Encounter and similar 1940s British dramas that emphasize fidelity in marriage, no matter how tempting a new-found love may seem.

What redeems The Glass Mountain is the scenery and the music - the setting in the Italian Dolomites is beautiful; the score is hyper-dramatic; and the singing is exquisite.

It would rate four stars, but the sound track of the dialogue is poor, and requires lip reading at times. The music, however, seems fine. I'd recommend it for the music and the camera work, but not as a moving or powerful film.",1374883200,,661,4.739130434782608

7927256,4,B00004YKSO,"THE GLASS MOUNTAIN (directed in 1949 by Edoardo Anton and Henry Cass) is a memorable drama starring real-life husband and wife acting team Michael Denison and Dulcie Gray; plus the lovely Valentina Cortese in her English-speaking movie debut.

The story revolves around struggling composer Richard Wilder (Denison) whose quest to write an opera about a Viennese mountain legend tests his marriage, and leads him into a passionate affair with a beautiful Italian woman.

Michael Denison offers a strongly-sympathetic performance in the lead role, playing a man torn between his loyal English wife (Dulcie Gray) and the young girl (Valentina Cortese) who re-awakens his creative spirit.  The film is also notable for a beautifully-shot opera sequence (scored by Nino Rota) featuring Tito Gobbi, Elena Rizzieri and other members of the Le Fenice Opera Company from Venice.

The DVD's image transfer suffers from various stability issues, and the soundtrack is very worn in certain areas.  Nevertheless, VCI has done classic movie lovers a great service by rescuing THE GLASS MOUNTAIN from the vaults and making it available for everyone to enjoy.

The DVD also includes cast biography pages, the original trailer, plus trailers of two other VCI releases (""Beyond Tomorrow"" and ""Pearl of the South Pacific"").  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1203379200,4,1340,5.444444444444445

7927258,1,B00004YKSO,"I had watched the Glass Mountain, once, as a young girl back in the early sixties and I remember that it had left an impact on me. Over the years I have often wondered whatit was about, as I was too young to remember. Now I have found it at AMAMZON but only on VHS which is only compatible with USA and Canada.  I come form Malta in Europe, so I CANNOT WATCH IT !!!.  Isn't there a way it could be converted to EUROPEAN specifications so we may enjoy it too????",1081987200,2,461,4.0
7927259,5,B00004YKSO,"I saw this early in the 50's on early TV--in fact, I saw it 3 or 4 times. I finally found a LP album that had the haunting and beautiful music--pianists Rawitz and Landauer played it and other semi-classical movie themes such as the Warsaw Concerto--in the early 1960's and played it to oblivion. Fortunately, I also cassette/taped it.
In the 1990's, I found a person who sold me a VHS of the movie. Well, I now see that the movie is commercially available and the theme is on a CD; again, with other scores. GET IT!! Both the movie and the theme music are one-of-a-kind.",1074729600,,571,4.39622641509434
