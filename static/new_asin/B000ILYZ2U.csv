8382527,5,B000ILYZ2U,"This is one DVD I highly recommend. I've seen virtual every DVD available on the subject of major corporations genetically altering our food and I found that this film is one of the most informative and largely overlooked because it deals with animals and the meat we consume. Most people who are aware of the GMO problem overlook the fact that corporations are geneticly altering animals as well. As a bonus, the producers have included original uncut bonus interviews of major scientists and experts on this topic making this an important feature of the DVD. On its own merits the bonus interviews alone makes this DVD well worth owning and sharing with family and friends. This DVD is loaded with bonus features as well as a well researched film and provides an unbiased, important piece to the issue at hand. Once I saw this film, I realized I must now be more careful about what I eat. I also highly recommend two other films that complete the picture regarding the issue of major corporations genetically modifying the food we eat.

Both of these films are from separate filmmakers but there from the same publisher, hence the DVD covers look similar. Both films seem complementary and togethor with the Animal Transgenic DVD basically blow the lid of this subject. Get all three DVD! Your worth it!",1259452800,2,1722,6.03265306122449
