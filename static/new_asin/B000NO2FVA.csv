8179899,1,B000NO2FVA,"Unfortunately, the second disk of the first copy I received wouldn't work in any DVD player or computer because the file had never been extracted before it was burned to the disk. I returned the first one and was promptly issued a replacement copy with the same problem. After repeaded attempts to find a computer program that could extract the file I gave up and returned the whole thing. On the plus side, Amazon.com did refund my money quickly. Still, it would have been nice to see that OT game wining goal again.",1283644800,2,517,4.56989247311828
