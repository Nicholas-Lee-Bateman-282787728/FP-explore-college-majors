7153793,2,B00WTGP3SM,"As a die-hard Survivor fan, I cannot in good conscience recommend this season. The cast becomes very nasty and spiteful, and honestly just leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. Only buy this one if you are a completionist.",1430265600,5,221,4.6923076923076925
7153794,1,B00WTGP3SM,"One of my favorite seasons. Ordered this as a gift to myself, was excited to come home to play it. Much to my chagrin the episodes won't play. The special features play just fine, but the episodes won't. Very disappointing",1486944000,,222,4.575
7153795,5,B00WTGP3SM,Love it!,1483660800,,8,3.5
7153796,1,B00WTGP3SM,"By far the worst of ALL 33 seasons. I feel like they tried to do for coach what they did for Boston Rob in the previous season, which was give him a tribe full of lemmings and a redemption island twist to almost guarantee him a victory. The only problem is that coach is one of the worst players in survivor history. He is incredibly unlikable(?) and not adept at the strategy portion of the game. He was a goat in a season that was basically built around his potential victory.

The other returning player, Ozzy, was very likable and interesting in Cook Islands. My opinion which is shared by many is that his 15 minutes of fame got to his head and he became a pompous, whiny douche. He provided very little entertainment in this season.

The rest of the cast is boring and bland. Brandon Hantz is a guy who's profession was listed as 'Russel Hantz' nephew'. Are you kidding me? This was a mentally unstable guy who had no business playing survivor either time he was cast. Dawn and Cochran were both recast for the next FVF season, which befuddles me to this day.

I am a huge Survivor fan since day one and have watched every season at least 3 times. South Pacific is the only season I have never rewatched because it is pure trash. By far the lowest point in the history of the show.",1483315200,,1287,4.331950207468879

7153805,1,B00WTGP3SM,"Product did not work. These DVDs use a recording format/technology that does NOT play on older model DVD players. Many other reviewer have also pointed this out, but it never occurred to me to check the reviews for something like a Survivor series DVD. VERY DISAPPOINTING.",1463961600,,272,4.934782608695652

The menu of the dvds work fine, as well as the sound, but when you open the individual episodes there is no picture!

7153817,1,B00WTGP3SM,"Love the show but very disappointed that the DVDs, none of them, in this set or in the Redemption Island set, will play in either our standard player or our Blueray player.  They DO play on laptops and our desktop.  Thanks to these reviews, we tried our Play Station, and they will play there, so we don't have to hook up our PC's to our TV.",1452556800,,341,4.151515151515151
7153818,4,B00WTGP3SM,I tried watching the episodes on my PS4 and the screen was black but I heard talking and music in the beginning. I then tried on my PS3 and it worked perfectly with no glitches and was able to watch the episodes with ease.,1452038400,,222,4.068181818181818

7153825,1,B00WTGP3SM,"Love the show and loved this season, but was extremely disappointed that neither the original DVD set that was shipped to me nor the replacement DVD set worked correctly. The special features played, but the episodes would not. Amazon customer service was completely useless, only offering me a refund and seemed unable to tell me if the glitch would be fixed and/or when I could order a working set. Now am unsure if I will ever be able to complete my collection. Hugely disappointed!!! :-(",1447372800,3,491,4.788235294117647

7153828,3,B00WTGP3SM,"It plays OK on my computer, but when I play it on my DVD player, it shows up all funny and cartoonish on my TV.  The special features play OK but not the episodes.  Maybe it's because I have an old style, non digital TV, but have never had a problem with any DVD before, including all the prior  Survivor seasons I bought from Amazon.  I usually do other things on my computer when I'm watching TV, do don't really want to watch the DVDs on it, plus my computer screen is small.",1445472000,2,478,4.10752688172043

7153838,2,B00WTGP3SM,"Probably a great quality DVD with awesome bonus features, but... wouldn't recommend the season, as it re-introduced one of the most anti-survivor twists in the game's history, redemption island. I would stay away from this season.",1435276800,,230,5.416666666666667
7153839,2,B00WTGP3SM,"If you're a diehard Survivor enthusiast, you probably won't mind this season, but all newcomers should stay away. The cast is.....decent, but the 2 returnees are unbearable, and some of the new contestants are downright obnoxious. The twist from the previous season returns, and although it plays a more important role this time, it never really amounts to anything. Add this to the predictable boot order, and you've got a season that only the completionists would buy and/or watch.",1430784000,6,483,5.1265822784810124

The missing disc wasn't known until we were well into watching the season...by the time we got to needing and discovering disc 6 was missing in the package, it was after the 30 day return/exchange window had closed.
