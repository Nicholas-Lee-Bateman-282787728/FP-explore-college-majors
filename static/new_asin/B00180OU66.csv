8268082,3,B00180OU66,"This movie is ""cute"" up to a point. Boy loves girl; girl loves dog; boy doesn't like dogs; dog doesn't like boy; boy gets to like dog; dog gets to like boy; girl feels neglected and thinks that boy now likes dog more than he does her; boy now has to fix the situation without alienating dog.  Everybody, including the dog, are ""cute"" especially the actor (Brendan Hines) who may have been chosen for the part because he has ""puppy dog eyes"" which are given many a close-up. One can guess the ending which is ok since the whole point of the film was the ""getting there"".  The picture does no harm and no animals or careers were hurt in the making of this film (except possibly for that of Malin Akerman). A carefree G movie that would probably make a better rental than purchase.  (Final cautionary note: Don't confuse this movie with another involving a young lady and her relationship with her pet dog prior to getting involved in a serious relationship with her new found boy friend.)",1420761600,,986,4.4972067039106145
8268083,4,B00180OU66,"I was all ready to sit here and claim that Heavy Petting is just another predictably written romantic film but then... they go and throw a funny and highly intelligent dog into the mix, and it works!  It won me over!

Alright, so it didn't win me over initially- it took time for the storyline to develop because quite frankly, the first 30 minutes of film are pretty darn awful and cliched focusing entirely around two single men doing really idiotic and unfunny things at a nightclub in an attempt to impress the ladies.  It was terrible.  I was honestly preparing myself for the worst but then, to my surprise, the movie *does* slowly improve once the dog enters the picture.

A couple scenes that were really hysterical to me were the following-

- When the man enters a pet store and asks for the biggest toy available.  Well the cashier man gives him the surprise of his life!

- When the man takes his dog to a clothing store and the dog walks around like a fashion model, lol.  I don't even know how they trained the dog to go along with this.  This happens later in the film.

- When the man and his girlfriend were trying to make out in bed, but every time the man would look over towards the chair he'd see the dog watching him, and would then become distracted.

- When the man was trying to sleep and the dog would sneak up towards his face and let out a shocking bark, lol.  Then the man turns around and does the same thing to the dog!!!

- When the dog was digging in the mans pants at the exact moment the man was attempting to make his first move on the girl, lol.

Overall, Heavy Petting is proof that a dog CAN make a difference in the quality.  What was originally going to be a 2-star movie is now 4 solid stars.  Amazing.",1300924800,,1744,4.236363636363636
8268084,5,B00180OU66,"How can you not like this movie?  The characters are engaging and the storyline is sweet.  I'm a dog lover, so I was really amused at all the jabs it took at at those of us who are obsessed with our four-legged friends.",1265587200,,219,4.069767441860465
8268085,4,B00180OU66,"Despite some unfavorable reviews here on Amazon, I decided to give this movie a try. I found it sweet, unexpected and fun.  There are some great comedic moments; the male lead rather reminds me of a young Dick Van Dyke in that he possesses both boyish goofiness and great comedic timing.  If you like a good romance and dogs, I think you'd like this movie.",1265587200,,356,4.461538461538462
8268086,1,B00180OU66,Don't waste your time... if you have morals then you won't like this movie.  Boy meets girl who loves dogs.  Boy pretends to love dogs.  Girl gets a new dog boy can't stand.  Boy beds girl to aggravate dog.  This movie is too predictable and lacks luster and originality.  Whoever thought of this plot lacks creativity.  In the meantime most couples like to enjoy a good romantic comedy together but if you are female (like me) and don't enjoy another female strutting her stuff across the screen in her underwear you will not care for this movie at all.,1239062400,2,554,4.5353535353535355
8268087,4,B00180OU66,"Charlie is looking for a relationship in this movie and meets a young woman named, Daphne.  He decides that he'd like to pursue her and things are going pretty good until she brings a cute dog home named, Babydoll.
Now, the problem is, Charlie is not a dog lover and both he and the dog know it.  Just how is Charlie going to pull off acting like one for his new lady.
As the story moves along, the adorable dog weaves her way into the very heart of Charlie and he begins to enjoy being with the dog more than the lady. Now he is in big troule because without one, he cannot have the other.
This movie was somewhat entertaining but not one that I personally would sit through again. I liked Charlie but my favorite was Babydoll  who I am sure could woo anyone to her side with the blink of her adorable eyes.
But to me the story lags a bit and the main highlights were the antics between the man and dog. So, if you like a movie where the dog wins the heart of man, this one is for you.",1226966400,,986,4.046153846153846
