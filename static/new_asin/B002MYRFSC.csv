8374276,5,B002MYRFSC,"I bought this DVD almost 3 years ago and decided to give it a go last week. Awesome! It's a great pairing of stretches and ab exercises. The tightness in my body got so bad, specifically in my lower back, hammies, and hip flexors that I started developing sciatica symptoms for the first time, and man, what a horrible pain; I was out of commission for two weeks. I went online looking for a stretching DVD totally forgetting I had this video sitting unopened in my closet. My stiff body was craving some form of stretching routine and after three sessions, it feels SO much better and more relaxed. I only did the ab part once and it's a great routine, but I do other forms of exercise, mainly kettlebells, ab wheels, etc., that do a pretty good job for my core strength, though I can see myself doing it again in the future when I take breaks from the kettlebell stuff. The stretches are what I love about this DVD though. If you're looking to get stretched out, get this! The female trainer chick is sexy cool, too, and for less than six bucks, this video's a steal. Can't wait to do another stretching session!",1522713600,,1114,4.412621359223301
8374277,5,B002MYRFSC,"This is the 4th DVD that I have purchased featuring Jeanette Jenkins. This workout goes hand-in-hand with the 21-Day Total Body Workout. The same group of people and same workout atmosphere are present. But with this video, all the people in the background introduce themselves prior to the workout, which was a nice touch.

There are 2 workouts: Core/Abs and Stretch. Each are 30 minutes long. The core does alot of ab work and require you be on the mat most of the time, as does the stretch workout.

Neither are intense or cause you to sweat, but are a nice change to the hard-core workouts. I've added these to my rotation.

NOTE: There is no recipe book inside - so don't expect it. I contacted thehollywoodtrainer office and they said they no longer put one in this video, but said they would mail me out something. Hoping to receive shortly.",1505347200,,848,4.602649006622516

8374279,3,B002MYRFSC,"The DVD is good for someone that don't have a vast collections of DVDs like I do. Nothing new, they all like to do planks which I still don't know what a plant is good for. Seems that it hurts the shoulders. I got the DVD mostly because I read so many good reviews about the stretching. I really wanted to learn new stretches, and the people on the DVD are so tight and not flexible at all. The stretches are very basic. I rather do some yoga with Rodney Yee, he has better yoga poses that are challenging and different.",1408492800,,520,4.158415841584159
8374280,5,B002MYRFSC,This is a quick 30 minute core workout or stretch workout!  My abs are improving by the day and it's hard enough that I never get used to it.  Worth every cent!,1392854400,2,160,3.96875
8374281,5,B002MYRFSC,"I do the exercises and stretches from this DVD at least 3 times a week and I have been instantly notices changes in my mid section and even strength in my muscles. I have done this with and without diet, and either way I have seen at least small changes. Don't give up or cop-out on any parts of the DVD though.",1362528000,3,311,4.032258064516129
8374282,5,B002MYRFSC,"This dvd is very good. I'm new to the Jeanette Jenkins workout dvds. This is my third purchase of her dvds in less that two months. I work out three days a week( a mix of cardio and strength training) and I do dvd this on the Saturday as my yoga. This dvd has great floor abs exercises which runs about 22mins then there is stretching for 40 mins. I really, really, really, really needed a stretching dvd because I don't enough stretching on my own. On the dvd, Jeanette and her exercise crew uses some sort of stretching band (which I don't have, lol) so I use a towel and it is more than effective for deep stretching. Whenever I fell tight like I need to stretch, I put on this dvd! Great shipping also.",1336521600,6,706,4.198529411764706
8374283,5,B002MYRFSC,"The first group of exercises in this DVD consists of floor exercises designed to strengthen stomache and back muscles. Jeanette leads a diverse group of students through different types of crunches, a plank and ends with a standing stretch.  Jeanette is beautiful, motivating, and cues well so you are prepared for each exercise.  The music is good and the set is beautiful.

I agree with the previous reviewer that the ""Stretch It Out"" section of this video is superb.  The stretches start out on the floor and gradually move to standing.  A towel or stretching strap is used to assist in deeper stretching.  There are a good variety of stretches for different parts of your body and she moves slowly enough between stretches that you can keep up.  I like that Jeannette explains the part of the body being stretched and gives instructions on proper form.  I also appreciate that she focuses on breathing.  I found it encouraging to notice the differences in flexibility of the students.  I own 3 stretching videos and this is my favorite! Highly recommended.",1332115200,7,1060,4.871508379888268
8374284,5,B002MYRFSC,"(I reviewed this elsewhere as ""Hollywood Trainer 21 Day Core and Stretch Workout (2007)"" but since this is the version I had actually bought (""Core & Stretch it Out"") and it had no reviews, I thought I'd repeat it here. Plus, it's not 30min abs and 30mins stretch as advertised - it's 20 mins abs/back and 35 mins athletic stretch. There's a few mins of introductions for 60 mins total.)

I suffer from hip problems, so am always looking for a good stretching routine that doesn't involve advanced yoga moves, since I am not that flexible. Up to now, my favorite was the 20min ""Yoga Stretch"" routine on Karen Voight's ""Slim Physique"" DVD. It has very relaxing music and is great to do late at night. But I was looking for an alternative that wasn't so relaxing, and bought this Hollywood Trainer DVD to compare.

This DVD is fantastic - a really good athletic stretch that leaves you feeling great afterwards. Most of the leg stretches are done with a strap (or a towel) and are a good length. Jeanette talks a bit loudly (she seems to forget she's using a mic) but I was looking for an alternate to the soothing voice and music atmosphere anyway so it was okay with me. (Just be warned that it won't make you sleepy...) If you know a wide range of stretches, you can substitute or modify a few here and there as needed.

Since I was only looking for a good stretch, the ""Core"" routine was a wonderful bonus. It's a solid ab workout (about 20mins) with lots of variety and a good pace. I like that it also includes a few minutes of back exercises. Overall, one of the very best ab workouts I have (and I own a few DVDs of ""10-minute ab workouts"" that I don't care for much).

The DVD is set up that you can start with the CORE workout and it moves into the STRETCH automatically, but keep the DVD remote handy so you can skip the two sections that introduce all the other participants in the room. I'm sure the producers thought it was a nice friendly thing to do, but (1) I don't care who is in the room with Jeanette and (2) I certainly don't wish to hear their life stories every time I want to work out. What were they thinking? This stuff should have been in an optional ""bonus"" section for people who are curious.

I also bought the ""AM/PM Stretch"" DVD (the PM is good enough, the AM is very tame - it might wake you up but that's about it).",1265414400,17,2347,4.300904977375565
