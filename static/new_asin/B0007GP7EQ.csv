2212097,1,B0007GP7EQ,"I just saw this movie on TV at night. This movie doesn't make any real sense. Any smart person with half of a brain would just move out of that apartment from that noise and wacky neighbor. Also most girls in real life wouldn't go home with some random weird looking guy she meets in a seedy bar after giving bad ""come on"" lines and have sex with him at his place! The bar scene doesn't really work in modern times. But then she was drunk and traumatized after seeing her wacky neighbor half dead in a pool of blood. After all that, what her wacky neighbor really wanted was to make the main female character her personal assisstant at her company. Later on she becomes like her wacky neighbor after killing her. How ironic! The circle comes complete.",1186272000,,751,4.410071942446043
2212098,3,B0007GP7EQ,"I accidently saw this movie on tv in the early morning while being very bored. So I started watching it and couldn't get myself to change the channel. This was a indepentdeant low budget movie , of mostly dialog. But i held my attention. This suspense movie had me watching to see what would happen next. THe main plot of the movie is a young lady moves into a apartment and her neighbor just keep making to much noise with her sex and music and what not. This noise just keep build up and up and ruins the young ladys life. The ending is very surprising. It wouldnt hurt to watch this movie.",1148947200,4,592,4.247787610619469
2212099,3,B0007GP7EQ,"Low-budget, independent, but not overly artsy. Like others of its kind, it has a slightly unsteady, surreal feeling to it, lacking the glossing-over that one is accustomed to from mainstream Hollywood movies. To be honest, this film isn't entirely successful at pulling off its genre, and there are better, more developed films with the same basic idea but a greater amount of introspection and polish (in terms of acting, script and storyline). But Noise isn't half-bad - it's just not a full meal.

It's disturbing, rather graphic at times - watch out for a few (thankfully brief) explicit sex scenes, as well as moments of violence. But mostly, the screenplay is supposed to work on a psychoanalytical level... or at least that's my rationalisation for why some characters constantly talk like they're either psychics or psychiatrists. This makes for an awkward script filled with a lot of presumptions, although I suppose it's just an attempt to give the film an eerie, penetrating aspect.

The premise: a young woman, Joyce, moves into a new apartment after a failed relationship. The tenant above her space is insane (read: very eerily eccentric) and won't stop blaring loud music in the wee hours of the morning. Joyce's sleep suffers for this, and she seeks various ways to put an end to the disruptive noise, growing increasingly desperate and increasingly unhinged.

The ending... well, if you've seen movies of this genre (psychological, abstract, probing into human nature and whatnot), you can probably guess the ending, keeping in mind that this is supposed to be a psycho thriller/drama.

All this being said, it could've been a more intelligent film, but (like some other ""deep,"" cerebral, abstract movies) Noise chose instead to end on a rather unsatisfying, trailing-off note.

A good watch if you don't mind the occasional explicitness and a medium amount of coarse language - but, if you are more for fast-paced action and a concrete plotline with everything laid out and explained, this may not be the film for you. Whatever you do, don't show it to young children... Noise shows a much darker side of humanity.",1118793600,10,2132,5.028328611898017
2212100,1,B0007GP7EQ,"This movie is unbelievably bad. From the poor acting, to the ridiculous actions the characters take, to the laugably stupid, hanging ending, to the ultra cheeze whiz dialogue ( who WROTE this abomination of a screen play?! YUK!)...The idea was a decent enough one, what happens when you have a nutjob living above you in an apt, but the absolutely ridiculous way this movie unfolds had me laughing at how stupid the thing was. I watched in fascination, just because the whole thing was so bad, it was sort of like watching a trainwreck or a scary movie, you can't look away! LOL ....Contender for worst movie of the last decade.",1115251200,5,628,4.666666666666667
2212101,2,B0007GP7EQ,"Noise is the *kind* of movie I generally like and search for --independent, low budget and not overloaded with special effects and other Hollywood gimmicks. A psychological thriller like this has to rely on the fundamentals --character and story-- to keep the audience's attention. While I did find Noise interesting, and at times engrossing, for me it fell short in some important respects. The starring role is played by the unknown Trish Goff, who does a good job as Joyce, an unstable woman who moves into a new apartment after a traumatic divorce. This apartment is supposed to be in New York City, but given the paltry view of the streets (except for one shot of the Empire State Building), we can be sure it was filmed elsewhere. This may seem like a petty quibble, but it bothers me that so many films do this. If they can't film in New York, fine, but why say it's New York then?

Joyce is pushed over the edge by Charlotte (Ally Sheedy), a very noisy and apparently deranged upstairs neighbor. I found the Charlotte character to be the film's weakest point. Ally Sheedy plays her as a kind of generic movie psychotic whose sole raison d'etre is apparently to torment Joyce.  While Goff, with her almost disconcertingly thin body and wide-eyed expression, manages to convey a real sense of someone on the edge of a breakdown, Sheedy's character is less believable and seems to belong in another film, perhaps a comedy. I just couldn't buy her madwoman routine here.

There are other aspects to the film that are less than believable. A woman's group Joyce joins to help get over her divorce contains an unlikely amount of cattiness and trash-talking. At one point, Joyce takes out a personals ad in Charlotte's name. She does this as a counter-harassment measure, but it backfires and brings out the nymphomaniac in Charlotte.  To me, this was an obvious and contrived excuse to spice up the movie with some gratuitous sex. If this weren't enough, there are a couple of scenes where Joyce has erotic encounters with men she just met. Having to make both of these women fill their time with casual sex suggests a lack of confidence in what is supposed to be the real story. Given that no plausible motive is given for either Joyce's or Charlotte's behavior, especially towards the end (in movies like this, well-meaning friends always ask the very sensible question, ""why don't you just move?"" but the victim never listens), we can see why they felt the need to divert us. Noise has an interesting premise (which evokes some better films such as Roman Polanski's The Tenant), but only partially delivers.",1114300800,7,2612,4.772123893805309
2212102,5,B0007GP7EQ,"You'll love this film if you are looking for something different.  This film defies the predictable and carries the viewer into a plot free to surprise us giving us a satisfying cerebral experience. Noise has the complexity, the nuance, the depth, of some of the best films I've seen.  I highly recommend it to those looking for a change of pace from your typical Hollywood film.  Trish Goff's performance was remarkable considering this was her first effort and she is literally in every scene.  Ally Sheedy was fantastic as the antagonist.",1112054400,9,541,4.912087912087912
2212103,5,B0007GP7EQ,"What a great ride.  This film had great unexpeted twists especially if you have ever lived in an apartment and wondered who you were living with. If anyone knows Trish Goff personally, get her to an assylim.  She's either a great actress or just nuts!  An Indie well done.",1111536000,7,272,4.510204081632653

You can feel totally helpless when you approach the perpetrator and they always seem to reject any suggestions you might offer for resolution.

8047454,3,B0007GP7EQ,"I instantly connected with Joyce. I felt so bad for her since I dealt with something similar in 2003. We had an idiot neighbor who lived across the street and blasted his rap music in his boom car daily for over a year. The bass was so loud it shook the house. It drove me crazy. We called the cops repeatedly and even spoke to the guy and things didn't change. Eventually he moved away, thank goodness. But because of that I know how damaging loud noise can be. It can affect you mentally because it invades your peace of mind, almost making you wanna snap. Plenty of times I felt myself nearing the edge. It's horrible to be subjected to such torture but have no control over it. It wasn't difficult for me to see how Joyce made the leap from sane to insanely desperate. When you deal with this type of harassment you start to feel cornered.

I liked this film. It is not an in-your-face thriller. At times it moves slow but each moment you're seeing deeper inside of Joyce and the type of person she is. She stays to herself and harbors many demons and by the time the film is over you realize that Joyce was her own worst enemy.

Some things didn't make sense like why Joyce didn't move other than for them to have a movie. Joyce hadn't been in the apartment long enough at all for her to be attached so when the noise started she could've found somewhere to go. I'd have gone to a shelter before being terrorized like she was.

But again, there has to be a reason for the movie and if she'd have moved there wouldn't have been any.

The acting was good on all ends. It was refreshing to see Sheedy in a bad chick role and the lead actress was very impressive and sympathetic as Joyce.",1347235200,3,1689,4.252336448598131
