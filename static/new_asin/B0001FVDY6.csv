1996205,5,B0001FVDY6,"Although I write this ""review"" weeks in advance of the release on DVD of ""Whispering Smith,"" there is, I think, the need to acknowledge this significant release before the event. Certainly after his magnificent ""Shane"" Alan Ladd's ""Whispering Smith"" deserves greater familiarity and exposure. It's a superb western, with some excellent acting, good production values, and well worth viewing. I am unaware that it ever showed up on VHS; but now that Universal intends to release it on DVD, moviegoers and western fans can enjoy it in their homes.

1996220,5,B0001FVDY6,"Released in 1948, ""Whispering Smith"" stars Alan Ladd in the eponymous role of a train detective who's starts to suspect that his friend, Murray (Robert Preston) may be involved with a gang that wrecks and loots trains. Murray's wife, (Brenda Marshall), is concerned about her husband hanging with ne'er-do-wells and wishes she had a righteous man, like Smith.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed ""Whispering Smith."" It lacks that goofy humor and wacky characters that plague many old Westerns; plus the ancient score is more bearable than usual. Ladd is stunning as the noble and determined protagonist and so is Preston as the amiable husband gone bad. Can Murray be redeemed or has he gone too far?

The film runs 88 minutes and was shot in California.

1996223,5,B0001FVDY6,"This is a wonderful Universal release long-neglected from the career of Alan Ladd given a full treatment including technicolor brilliance and clarity befitting this major star.  Here, this western towers above other shoot-em-ups in several ways: well-staged gun play where imminent death was possible from 360 degrees no matter the grudge, uncertain villain(s) and a contemporary message to employees forced through circumstance to engage in larceny. ""Whispering Smith,"" (Ladd) arrives and employs his detective skills and gun play from the start, though wounded in an initial encounter with outlaws. On the trail of the gang he gets re-united with an old flame (Brenda Marshall) married to his close associate, Murray Sinclair (Robert Preston) who gets drawn into a  Smith's field of fire uneasily. (Brenda has an amazing resemblance to Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, very convincing as a former crush for Ladd. To this unique story, you also have outstanding character actors: Frank Faylen, William Demarest, Fay Holden and Donald Crisp-- this time as a villain, Barney Rebstock. Greed, jealousy and envy play into this fast-paced script, splendidly photographed night or day. The other characteristic about this western is the premeditation, forethought about Sinclair deliberating about the path he takes. Whispering Smith does all he can to let Sinclair escape a violent end. The way his demise occurs is merciful and justified. When you think about it, Murray Sinclair took the wrong path when he justifiably lost his job. Even today, we see repercussions from that common occurrence. Others are right though, next to ""Shane,"" this is the most action-packed western to rise in regard by Ladd's newest fans who know he should see a wider audience.",1411689600,,1750,5.36

1996240,4,B0001FVDY6,"Whispering Smith (Leslie Fenton, 1948, 88')

Written by Frank Butler, Karl Kamb, Frank H Spearman (novel)
Starring Alan Ladd, Robert Preston, Brenda Marshall (ie Ardis Ankerson)

Alan Ladd plays a railroad detective assigned to stop a gang of train robbers. Rather rough action. Much horse chasing in beautiful mountain country.

Remarkable performance by Brenda Marshall, an American film actress: After divorcing actor Richard Gaines in 1940, she married the actor William Holden in 1941, and her own career subsequently quickly slowed. Sorry for her, sorry for the film industry, sorry for the audience.

In 1961, Whispering Smith became a 20-episode NBC series of the same name, with Audie Murphy, film star and World War II hero, in the title role, as Ladd was considered too short and too blonde for the role ...

Early in this movie, Alan Ladd is trying to stop a train robbery and is shot in the shoulder and while falling from the train engine turns around and shoots back at his attacker, killing him.  We both MARVELLED at that sequence and attempted it many times iin our play-acting of it!! He was such a good actor and man,, but I think Alcohol took it's toll on him, as well as barbituates.

1996245,4,B0001FVDY6,"Soft-spoken railroad detective Luke ""Whispering"" Smith (Alan Ladd) crosses the mountains in search of the train-robbing Barton Brothers, kills two of them, and is wounded himself.  His old friend Murray Sinclair (Robert Preston), in charge of clearing wrecks from that division of his road, takes him home to be nursed back to health.  But it soon becomes clear that these two are bound for an inevitable wreck of their own: Murray's wife Marian (Brenda Marshall), though five years married to him, is still desperately in love with Smith, who's never gotten over her either, and Murray has succeeded beyond the bounds of legitimacy by supplementing his railroad work with an alliance with Barney Rebstock (Donald Crisp), a rancher-cum-rustler who also peddles goods ""salvaged"" from the wrecks Murray works.  When Division Super George McCloud (John Eldredge) fires Murray for his light-fingered ways, the furious Murray sees no reason not to go the whole hog in avenging himself, and now it's up to Smith to stop him.  This and the sinister, cold-blooded gunman Whitey DuSang (Frank Faylen) give the movie more than a little of the same tragic feel as Ladd's generally-acknowledged masterpiece-Western,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shane/dp/0792163710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shane</a>, but the presence of bluff, hearty Murray and veteran character actors Crisp and William Demarest (as Bill Dansing) give it a lighter feel and a touch more humor.

His book was was the best-selling novel of 1906 and remained popular for many years.  Holywood could not ignore a great story with such an engaging title and the 1st silent film was made in 1916. Spearman's original character was based on several railroad detectives and the nickname belonged to one...James L. Smith.  Regretably, the real detective was nothing like Spearman's fictional character.  His actual nature is recounted in my ""Whispering Smith: His Life and Misadventures.""

1996261,5,B0001FVDY6,"Railroad detective Luke ""Whispering"" Smith (Alan Ladd) rides out of the snow covered mountains into the valley below in search of the train robbing Barton brothers, he is ambushed by two of the brothers, losing his horse he sets out to nearest railroad and hitches a ride on the Nebraska & Pacific train, intending on making an unscheduled stop at Coyote Creek to telegraph the sheriff at Medicine Bend. But the Bartons brothers have beaten them to it and attack the train at the station. In the ensuing gunfight Leroy Barton (Ward Wood) and Gabby Barton (Bob Kortman) are killed, whilst the leader Blake Barton (Murvyn Vye) makes good his escape. Smith then collapses from a bullet wound he received during the shoot-out.

Fellow railroad worker Murray Sinclair (Robert Preston) takes Smith home to his ranch. His wife Marian (Brenda Marshall) having known Smith in earlier times nurses him back to health. As a result of a friendly visit by Bill Dansing (William Demarest) Smith learns that Blake Barton is being holed up in William's Canyon under the protection of no-good gang leader Barney Rebstock (Donald Crisp) and his henchman Whitey Du Sang (Frank Faylen). Smith accosts Rebstock and Whitey in Medicine Bend and has a final shootout with Blake Barton.

Sinclair falls out with newly appointed railroad boss George McCloud (John Eldredge) and throws his lot in with Rebstock, together they organise a series of raids on the railroad.  Smith is recalled to Medicine Bend to investigate, he meets Marian on arriving in town then has a face-off in the saloon with Murray and Rebstock. Later following a hold-up at Tower ""W"" a guard is killed. The gang then high tail it for William's Canyon. Whispering Smith heads a railroad posse to round up the gang and bring them to justice one way or the other.

Directed at a fast pace by Leslie Fenton, based on the story by Frank H. Spearman and scripted by Frank R. Butler and Karl Lamb. Alan Ladd is first-rate in the title role the film has a fine opening sequence leading up to the ambush, parts of which look almost ""Shane"" like, indeed after ""Shane"" it's probably Ladd's best Western! The romantic interest is Brenda Marshall (Mrs. William Holden) who plays Marian Sinclair. The film is also the last pairing of Ladd with Preston Foster after having made several films together! Look out for Hank Worden (Mose Harper in ""The Searchers"") as Murray's ranch-hand.

Filmed sixty years ago at Paramount Studios and on location at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, and Sierra Railroad, Jamestown, California, USA. Beautiful scenery, Top quality color transfer to DVD no spots or scratches to be seen. (Would they were all like this) Highly Recommended.",1170547200,10,2691,4.918502202643172
