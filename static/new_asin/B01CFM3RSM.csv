7682797,4,B01CFM3RSM,"The movie is hypnotic in the way it is structured, induces sleep.  But I managed to pause at times certain sections with the Napoleon ghost, the museum tours with background rhetorical questions to get a quick nap then push play again to follow through and appreciate all the historical value.  The cartoon-like depiction of Count Von Maternich and Jacques Joujard helped tell the story of what happened to the Louvre during the war, the state and suffering of the French people.  I like how the audio line on the left of the screen popped up to remind the viewer that what is being watched was an acted script which may not reflect real events.",1467590400,3,645,4.640350877192983

7682799,4,B01CFM3RSM,"""Francofonia"" (2015 release from France; 90 min.) is a non-fiction movie loosely about the Louvre museum in Paris. As the movie opens, we hear a certain Alexander (that would be the movie's Russian director Alexander Sokurov) in conversation with a certain Dirk, who is on an ocean liner with art in one of its containers. It's not long before Sokurov directs his attention to June 14, 1940, when German troops overtook Paris, including archive footage of Hitler inspecting the Eiffel Tower and muttering ""Where is the Louvre?"" Eventually, we are introduced to Jacques Jaujard, the Louvre's museum director at that time, and Count Metternich, entrusted by Hitler to supervise the Louvres art collection for the Nazis. At this point we're not quite 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest oeuvre from writer-director Aleander Sokurov, best know for ""Russian Ark"" (about the Hermitage in St. Petersburg). In fact it can be said that ""Francofonia"" is a spiritual sequel to that movie. Going in, I knew that ""Francofonia"" was about the Louvre, but didn't know more than that. And while it is true that the movie's primary subject matter is the Louvre, it is in equal measure about the WWII occupation of Paris by the Germans, and a bunch of other things as well (""why are portraits so important in European culture, whereas they are non-existent in the Muslim culture?"", asks Sokurov). Even while it's not always clear what the ultimate aim or direction of the movie is, that's not a problem for me. The only jarring thing for me was the occasional and unnecessary appearance of actors impersonating Napoleon (whom we see staring at the Mona Lisa, while repeating ""C'est moi!"") and France. And oh yea, we do get to see a bunch of paintings and other works of art from the Louvre. In the end, I was surprised how quickly the 90 min. had flown by, so while this movie is rather strange, it certainly is intriguing and held my attention.

This movie made quite a splash at the 2015 Venice Film Festival. ""Francofonia"" opened without any pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati recently, and the Thursday early evening screening where I saw this at was one of its last, as the movie was gone the next day. I was frankly surprised how many people there were (about 10), but many they had the same thought as I did (better see this before it's gone!). If you are in the mood for a deeply subjective non-fiction film (but don't call it a documentary) about the Louvre, I'd readily suggest you check this out.",1463011200,21,2682,4.753218884120171

7682801,2,B01CFM3RSM,"I wanted to like this film as any movie about the Louvre interests me after having been there multiple times. It is the Cathedral of the French contribution to Western Civilization. But the movie's beginning was so muddled (the director's friend,  Dirk, calling in on a bad Skype connection from the stormy Atlantic), so confusing, so conceited and artistically abstruse, I endured about 45 minutes until I turned it off and did not finish it. The director's crazy little Napoleon character popping up in the middle of the Salon de le Grand Format was the clincher. The Russian director raised one interesting observation when in panning through its priceless portraiture, he asked in Russian why Western Civilization thrills to portrait paintings while the Islamic culture does not;  an astute observation which could not outweigh this formidable mass of Russian cinematography.  Rather than finishing this movie, I decided to go to the Louvre instead and draw my own conclusions.",1472515200,,981,5.19620253164557

7682803,1,B01CFM3RSM,What was he thinking? I fell asleep within 20 minutes! I am definitely a Francophile but this film is such a drudgery to watch that even my latent enthusiasm for all things French could not overcome the ennui.,1470787200,3,209,4.526315789473684
7682804,3,B01CFM3RSM,"This is my first film viewing of the work of Russian director Alexander Sokurov.  I found it odd, interesting and pompous by turns. Supposedly about saving the master pieces of the Louvre from Nazi looters in WWII the film is much more.  Sokurov roams from the 12th century when the first buildings in the massive museum complex went up through the mid 20th century.  But do not think of this as a simple history of a magnificent building or even only of the story of the attempts to save the art in the time of the greatest, most destructive war in history.  Think of it as history as imagined by a poet and you might get the flavor of the docudrama.
  Sokurov uses the French national emblem Marianne and the Emperor Napoleon to illustrate points that he wants to make.  Marianne only repeats the national slogan 'equality, liberty and brotherhood' from time to time, often while viewing works of transcendent art that are most appreciated by the most highly educated and sophisticated people in the world.  I am not sure exactly what his point was there.  But Napoleon's contribution is easier to assimilate.  We are led by the Emperor through artifact after artifact after artifact that he himself looted from Egypt.  While showing the mummy's and what not Napoleon mutters about war being about art and the fact that the winners in war get the cool art to take home.  This is not exactly a pleasant message in a film about the Nazi occupation of Paris.
  Two men occupy the center of the film.  One is the soldier in charge of the art of Paris, a German noble of a great family, a man with a deep understanding of culture in all its aspects, a humanist.  The other is his French counterpart, the official in charge of the grandest museum in the world.
  Sokurov allows some careless editing and a sub plot of a modern day shipping accident which is neither pertinent nor resolved.  I would have liked a lot more shots of the treasures of the Louvre.  That said, I found this a fascinating if obscure look into the film making of an original mind.",1470700800,,2051,4.551912568306011
7682805,2,B01CFM3RSM,"Fractured editing makes this film hard to get into.  Historical references excellent, as was the photography, bur superfluous ""floating woman"" unnecessary. Who took the art that was sunk at sea?  Was art plundered?  What was saved?",1469836800,2,231,5.361111111111111

8752940,5,B01CFM3RSM,"If you've seen Sokurov's Russian Ark, one of the most dreamy, graceful and intricate films ever, you might expect Francofonia to be cut from the same cloth being as they are about two of the most prominent art museums in the world. But, it's not. And, you might initially be disappointed.

Francofonia is intricate, but not in the almost psychedelic (and voyeuristic) way that Russian Ark glimpses people of history in the nooks and crannies of The Hermitage Museum in one phenomenal long take. Here, in Sokurov's newest film, we witness layers cut to and fro: Captain Dirk aboard the container ship with a cache of artwork on the sea in a raging storm (and seen via Skype); the story of Jacques Jaujard and Franz Wolff-Metternich (French Museum Director and German director of the Kunstschutz) who together managed to save the Louvre's treasure from the Nazis; and Sukurov's heady musings on Art, Time and War. Sokurov's thoughts hover above the masterpieces and mummies of The Louvre, both powerful in their expression of what it is to be human. Francofonia is a completely dynamic intellectual journey that begs multiple viewings.

The extras include the well-made and informative documentary, ""The Man Who Saved the Louvre"" (""Illustre et Inconnu"") with narration both in French and in English by Mathieu Amalric which will tell you everything about Jacques Jaujard. There is also a ""making of"" documentary ""Visitors to the Louvre"".",1486166400,2,1435,5.076271186440678

8752944,2,B01CFM3RSM,"My verdict was mixed  being a Russian director, it was weighty and covered rather too much world history context and reference of the time, while experimenting with some unusual film techniques (Russian narration, skyping in the film, flash backs, exotic light work) and almost zero on the relationship between the Nazi responsible for pinching the artworks and his colleague the head of the Louvre who worked to keep the art works out of the Nazis hands.  It was acknowledged at the end that very little is known about their relationship which was disappointing.  Certainly an intriguing bit of history that is almost entirely lost to history.  There were broader references to the role of art, and the responsibilities of curators etc at times of war and the role of museums etc, but it was possible to miss these amidst trying to follow the story line.  It was definitely a documentary except when a Fairy appeared alongside Napoleon in the Louvre  yes, all a bit too Russian.  So I gave it a 5/10 because I had to work hard to follow and also stay awake in parts, and in the first 20 minutes I thought we had walked into the wrong movie hall!!!",1477612800,,1148,4.653465346534653
