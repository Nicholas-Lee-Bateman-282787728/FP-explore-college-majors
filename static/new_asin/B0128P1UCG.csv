7343944,5,B0128P1UCG,"I've always been a fan of Modern Marvels and this DVD contains two episodes devoted to the gadgets of the world's greatest spy - Bond, James Bond.  As a bonus there is a biography of Ian Fleming which does a great job of giving the viewer some insights into the mind that created Bond.

If you are a fan of James Bond, this is a must have as an addition to your collection of movies and memorobilia.  Highly recommended.",1348272000,6,420,4.291139240506329

7343947,3,B0128P1UCG,"The gadgets from the Bond films are exciting and this disc is not.  Don't get me wrong ~ this disc has a lot of background and little known facts about the gadgets and Bond himself.  The tidbits behind the gadgets are really interesting but the monotone presenter doesn't convey this.  If you want to know more about the cool gadgets in the 007 arsenal, this is a must have.  If you want to be entertained like the movies, watch the movies instead.",1361145600,,448,4.426829268292683

7343949,4,B0128P1UCG,"The video is from Modern Marvels (the gadgets part) and the Biography channel (the Flemming bio).  Interestingly, the gadgets portion which is very interesting does not have any clips directly from the bond movies.  They do have some shots taken by the crew, but none from the movies.  It would have been more interesting if the real gadgets were shown with movie footage.  Overall very good.",1357344000,5,392,4.893939393939394
