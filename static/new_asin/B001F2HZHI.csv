3561274,3,B001F2HZHI,"Not impressed at all!  The leg work is good, but it's basically pilates techniques.  The ab work and arm work are useless!",1222473600,4,122,4.5
3561275,3,B001F2HZHI,"The mat workout dvd is 1 hour long. That includes Tracy's introduction at the beginning and interviews with Gwyneth and Tracy at the end. The workout itself is 45 minutes, including warm-up. She does little talking/instruction throughout so you do have to pay attention to the tv most of the time which makes parts of the workout hard to follow at times. The standing ab workout is a joke. She gives no instruction at all during this little hip-ab dance. It is very difficult to determine which way she is moving because of the camera angle and the speed at which she is moving. That part is completely useless unless you are a skilled dancer. There is a mat ab workout later which is much better and includes instruction. It will take time to get used to the moves and the lack of instruction; however, I think it could be viewed as a positive thing for those of us who use the same workout dvd over and over. Once you know the moves, you won't have the annoying incessant talking throughout the whole thing. This is not an easy workout but it is very doable. The best part is you get a great workout with low impact. Overall, I love it.",1222387200,15,1138,4.398104265402844
3561276,1,B001F2HZHI,"I have been trying to find out what type of workout this is. No info on it anywhere. I e-mailed Tracy via her website several times but no response.  I think this is probably just hype since she trains the stars and have decided not to purchase it.  Tracy, if you want to sell these workouts you need to supply some info. A clip of the workouts on your site would be great.  I know these are not the same workouts you use for your upper crust clients but $30 for a DVD is alot to put out without knowing what your buying.",1222300800,11,521,4.038834951456311
3561277,1,B001F2HZHI,"I do not even know where to begin.  This woman barely talks through the whole video so you must keep your eyes on the television at all times to see when she switches movements.  Half of the time she is just in her own little world dancing around and not giving you any direction.  The ab workout is not for anyone with a bad back and there are no modifications.  I am not an expert, but I do not think that these are safe movements the way she is just swinging the weights around.  Did I mention the music in the background is awful!  Don't get roped in because of the stars that use her.",1222300800,13,589,4.078260869565217
3561278,4,B001F2HZHI,"I own Tracy's first dance DVD and was looking forward to this mat workout.  I agree that the cover/her website gives very little info on the workout itself.  She begins the workout with a gentle warmup, starts off with a standing leg series - you need a chair to hold/balance yourself.  She then does some standing ab work, no equipment needed.  She then goes into standing arm work, you need 3 lb dumbbells.  She then does lying leg work and lying ab work followed by a cool down.  Overall I like this video, I like the leg work especially.  However I like to lift heavier with my upper body, so the other day I did the entire video minus the arm work - I subbed in my own workout there with heavy weights.  I can tell you that my legs are feeling the effects of this workout, which in my opinion is worth it.

I hope this info helps those who might be interested in purchasing this DVD.",1222128000,30,888,4.238095238095238
3561279,5,B001F2HZHI,"I just got the dance Dvd and I Love It!  It's a great combination of dance and cardio.  The routines really challenges you, however, you don't feel like  you are struggling - if you just work the routine every day and go at your own pace, you'll get there!  All in al great fun!!  I just have one question- where is  her clothes from? Especially her shoes!  Thank you sooo much!!",1221782400,10,379,4.253521126760563
3561280,5,B001F2HZHI,"I'm so glad I bought this workout.  It has a gorgeous balletic feel to it and just makes you feel so graceful after working out.  The first part is a standing leg series with plies, etc and the upper body work is done with very low weights.  As a matter of fact Tracy advocates that women never use anything heavier than three pounds, but despite the low weight you'll feel completely worked out.  The second part is on the floor and includes lower body exercises as well as core and abdominal work.  It's also beautifully filmed and the music is perfect for it.",1221696000,71,562,4.41747572815534

3561293,4,B001F2HZHI,"I just got it and only did it once, but as a veteran of most of the Beachbody programs (P90x, Core de Force, Hammer and Chisel) I am used to working with weights. I did not expect much from this, but wanted to try something lower impact. I can honestly say I have never had my arms hurt so much while working out. There is obviously something to her ""method"". I am interested to see where I am in a month with this. I have seen a lot of the other moves she does in my other workouts, but the flailing arms thing she does, it burns!",1511827200,,531,3.97196261682243

3561295,1,B001F2HZHI,"Let me begin by saying I am not new to working out. I've been working out for over 30 years. And I am also not new to using DVDs for my workouts. I quit going to gyms about 10 years ago and now solely workout in my home studio and rely heavily on DVDs. When I get a new DVD, the first thing I do is watch it so I have some idea of what it is all about, how to use it, what equipment - if any - I will need, etc... So - excited to try this new workout, I popped it into my dvd player and jumped on my elliptical to watch it through. I was stunned at what this was. The only way I can describe it is that I felt like I was watching someone dancing with a chair in their living room. It is very hard to see what she is doing or how she is doing it and she gives very little direction in a very quiet voice (almost like she is talking to herself). There is no indication of what you are trying to do, what muscles you focus on in the move, how many you will do...nothing. And she changes movements every 3-4 repetitions. It is the most ridiculous workout dvd I have ever seen. Needless to say, I just finished printing out the return label. Please save your money. And for those of you who say you used it and got great results - god bless. No idea how you figured out what to do.",1503532800,8,1276,3.818867924528302
3561296,1,B001F2HZHI,Lack of description and instruction on moves; camera angles are poor and don't inform her actions either. Maybe if she actually had any professional credentials or training she would be better at this....,1501718400,2,204,5.212121212121212

3561299,5,B001F2HZHI,"Great workout but challenging when beginning. I used this DVD to start getting in shape after having my kids and it was tough but I saw great results and it inspired me to start lifting weights to further challenge myself.
It is hard, you will get lost and you will be sore, but don't give up.",1499558400,,293,4.25
3561300,5,B001F2HZHI,I love this workout.  Very different then a lot of others not as intense in my opinion.,1499558400,,87,4.117647058823529
3561311,5,B001F2HZHI,"I've owned this DVD since it first came out, back when Tracy touted this and the companion dance DVD as the way to get in shape. I never liked the dance video (how jumping jacks are dance, I'll never know), but I love the Mat Workout and think, even years later, that it's her best workout.

A few notes:

Yes, she doesn't explain much. It's annoying at first, but once you've done the workout for a while it's fantastic not to hear every single move explained to death.

I chuckle over how the back copy of the DVD *now* says you shouldn't do it for more than a month because you need to move on. I'm not interested in Tracy's crazy expensive video streaming.

Finally, this vs. Metamorphosis. This workout devotes 15 minutes to arms, 10 or so to abs, and about 20 very thorough minutes to legs and glutes.

Metamorphosis, at least in the beginning, gives you, at most, 10 minutes to arms and abs, then rushes through the leg exercises for the remaining 20.

I'll stick with Tracy working every part of my body in a non rushed fashion.

And you can't beat the price!",1498867200,15,1067,4.385786802030457
3561312,5,B001F2HZHI,"This DVD is the gold standard for mat workouts. The arm series is killer, and if you really engage in the movements - flex and point your feet, stretch your arms (and fingers!) and move with strength, you will absolutely see results. Negative reviews on here are probably from users flopping around and not being consistent. Also - working out in front of a mirror will help you see and correct your form.",1494892800,,405,4.561643835616438
3561313,5,B001F2HZHI,"I must say, at first I thought this video was a joke.  Tracy bugged me because I felt like she was trying to make this an ""adult film"".  I really wasn't planning on doing it again after the first time.  I liked the way I felt after doing it though, so I gave it another shot.  Once you get the hang of it, it becomes addicting!  You can feel the changes immediately and see results quickly.  I love the legs and the arms portion.  I still can't complete the standing abs because I get lost.  Coordination isn't my strong suit.  You're probably not going to get through it the first time, and it is REALLY long.  I prefer workouts around 1/2 hour, this is close to an hour.  TIP:  Really absorb what she says about ""dead"" versus ""alive"" arms and legs.  When you're extending your leg, POINT your toe and straighten your leg as much as possible.  That's where the results come from.  When you're doing the arms, reach as much as you can and ""activate"" your arms.  If you don't ""activate"" your muscles, you're wasting your time.",1494547200,13,1025,4.372340425531915

3561317,5,B001F2HZHI,"I love these workouts, they are so different than what I normally do so it is a nice switch up. The arms part will definitely have you weak!",1483488000,,140,4.035714285714286
3561318,5,B001F2HZHI,"I really love this workout. Tracy has a cool way of instructing, you go with the flow and she doesn't talk to much. The exercises are effective but not too challenging. I have done her metamorphoses workouts which are very good but not as enjoyable to do. I wish she would make more mat workouts like this.",1482969600,,306,4.385964912280702
3561319,3,B001F2HZHI,"This particular workout feels RANDOM.  Feels like she makes up some moves until a song is over.  Especially the part that she moves her rib cage.... no instructions.  Hard to follow.  It's still a good workout but not as good as her ""express"" ones which I know exactly how many reps are coming up.",1482883200,2,297,4.444444444444445
3561320,5,B001F2HZHI,"I've been doing this pretty consistently since this summer & I definitely think it works. My arms are looking really good!

3561327,4,B001F2HZHI,"great full body workout.  I fell in love with her method with this video.  I love her arms workouts.  it's physically tough and mentally challenging.  the music is great.  her floor leg work is a bit awkward in this one.  I don't have a ton of space in my room, so I'm usually kicking backwards into my bed or a table.  that's not her fault, just something to consider.  people have criticized the standing abs as goofy, but it has really gotten me in touch with the movement of my core and shoulders.  I love moving in this way now.  I feel much more rhythmic and sensual.  the floor ab work is kind of short in this video, but good for a day where that may not be your focus but you'd still like to work them out.  her best abs routines are in precision toning and post pregnancy.  the standing legs in this video are tough.  but my whole body feels looser after her doing her workouts.",1476144000,8,888,4.208333333333333
3561328,4,B001F2HZHI,"The wife seems to like it a lot.  I can't comment, I've never done the workout myself.  The chick's pretty hot though.",1475366400,,118,4.318181818181818
3561329,1,B001F2HZHI,During the standing leg series the continual swinging motion resulted in my getting a labral tear in my right hip. I'm in terrible pain constantly and will likely require surgery to repair it. I wish I'd never bought this DVD because now I can't do all the things that I used to love to do. Bending and squatting is extremely painful...can't do many day to day things until the tear is repaired. Be very careful during the standing leg series- don't try to follow Tracy or keep up with her reps...that results in swinging and momentum (recipe for a tear - that she never warns you about) - but now consider yourself warned.,1473724800,4,623,4.522123893805309
3561330,5,B001F2HZHI,"Despite the cons that I would have agreed with everyone else in the beginning, they are actually my pros now.  No, she doesn't give direction every time but after doing this for a month, I like that she is more quiet.  The constant barking by others is not motivating or appealing to me.  The biggest plus is that after a month, I am seeing major changes in my shape that I LOVE.  I also feel stronger in a way I have never before at any other point I've worked out.

She took the criticism and applied to her more recent videos which do provide proper direction and she counts off every movement (which is annoying to me now that I've gotten accustomed to this one).  With a short amount of time you will get her rhythm and recognize when and how she transitions.

TIPS:
Turn up volume more than normal. Some direction comes across as a whisper.
Keep DVD remote close.
Be careful of breathing, don't strain it. And posture, don't twist neck or spine when attempting exercises.

You'll need:
Chair
Yoga mat (maybe not necessary if you do on carpet)
1, 2 or 3 lb weights

PROS:
The music is perfect
The exercise program itself is fabulous
I'm noticing a very nice change in shape
Exercises give me great workout, still can't complete all sets after several weeks
She's super cute
It's got a nice dance vibe

CONS:
The timing in between sets is minimal, so you may need to pause to get yourself set-up
Lack of pointers on breathing
Pointers on posture could be more
Sometimes she doesn't do same number both sides.  Not a big deal to me
One time she says 5 more and it's really 10
Sometimes she doesn't announce change in activity

For Warmup section:
Your head might be down and you won't know that she has changed. Listen carefully. And you'll eventually remember enough on your own. Careful not to twist head too much while doing so you don't throw yourself out of whack.",1472601600,,1872,4.457478005865102
3561331,1,B001F2HZHI,"Simply, the worst exercise video I have ever attempted to do. Her cuing is essentially non-existent She almost appears to be in her own world as she performs the move and the facial expressions (lip pout) put it over the edge for me . . . I had to turn it off as I just couldn't take any more. This is going straight into the donation pile.",1466985600,2,340,4.08955223880597
3561332,5,B001F2HZHI,I have many Tracy Anderson workout DVDs and this is still one of my favorites. The workout is excellent and challenging.,1462665600,,120,4.761904761904762

3561334,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have never exercised with DVDs before but I am a total convert!  So wonderful to be able to exercise at home, no gym fees or going out, or worrying about inclement weather.
A friend who does metamorphosis recommended Tracy, and my acupuncturist recommended her as well (after hearing from me week after week how frustrated I was with my clothes not fitting), so I figured I'd better try it.  I scrutinized reviews until I was satisfied that this was the best and most economical place to start.  I really respect that Tracy creates a TON of content for exercisers--I have started on Precision Toning, and I have the Post-pregnancy (no, I'm not, but apparently it has a great abs workout) and Perfect Design series in the wings.  The whole theory is that you have to change things up every 10 workouts or so, to continue having great results, so I figure I can eventually move on to Metamorphosis etc, but in the meantime I'll spend very little and have DVDs I can rotate through and get killer workouts.
I have a structural defect in my back and my lower back is very unstable, so I've had to largely give up running--but I really missed that feeling of really working my muscles HARD!  When you run you feel totally oxygenated and it works everything, and I missed how I felt afterward, and that strong core I used to have.  Yoga is hit or miss for me--sometimes the twisting lands me in spasm on the floor for a few days. I do a lot of physical therapy and am very body aware, so I went into this wanting to make sure I wasn't going to hurt myself with it.  To my surprise, after doing this workout about 4X/week for 2 weeks, my core strengthened to the point that my chronic back pain was much less. The REAL benefit, though, was to have wayyyyyyyyyy more energy for everything else in my life! My whole body feels very worked by this DVD but I recover quickly for the other tasks I have to accomplish. I crave working out now, and instead of being exhausted by it, I find I have tons more energy and feel vibrant! My skin is softer (my BF noticed) and I sleep (slightly) better.  My friends want me to shut up about it.  I also do Ballet Beautiful workouts and find they complement each other very well.
My body has definitely ""adjusted"" to this workout but even though I've moved on to Precision Toning (KILLER) I still do this 1-2 times per week cuz I know it's back/joint friendly and makes me feel great.  I haven't adjusted my diet, but my waist has gone down from 28 to 27"", and I've lost over .5"" on each upper arm (my sister is fond of pointing out that I have ""big arms"", lol).  My cellulite on upper thighs and backs of legs is reduced, and my inner thigh has more of a curve just above the knee.  I feel pretty confident that if I work my diet a bit more I'll lose some inches on my thighs as well (I'm pretty muscular and bulk very easily--my gymnastics instructor when I was 8 called me ""Muscles""!) Seriously, try this.  If you have a back injury, see your chiropractor a little more often when you are just getting started, but once you strengthen up your core it will all be worth it.",1458259200,9,3105,4.341968911917099
3561335,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have tried many things to get slim arms, exercise, special cream, personal trainer... even when I was 98lbs at my slimmest, my arms and legs still look relatively big proportionally, that's how my body is built. I am always self conscious in wearing sleeveless clothes, I almost never wear them at all, and if I do occasionally wear a sexy dress at other people's weddings, parties or events, I would cover my arms with a shawl. Honestly, I would rather wear a dress with sleeves if I have a choice so I can move easier without the shawl keeps dropping, but unfortunately most of the party and evening dress out there that comes with sleeves are usually granny style! For my wedding, I had a vision and wanted to wear a long red evening dress and flow like the scene of Audrey Hepburn running down the stairs in 'Funny Face' when doing my first dance. But the thought of needing to put sleeves on a red evening dress makes me want to cry as it's so clumsy and old fashioned. After seeing the slim down body of my best friend by doing the exercise in this DVD (she said she only lost 5lbs, but her body was toned up), I bought a copy and tried my luck. I started to do some of the workout 2 months before my wedding, my waist was 25inches, my face was very slim but my arm looked flabby and huge. I did this about 3-4times a week (on the 2nd month I was lazy and stress out for the wedding, so I skipped the other exercise and just did the warm up and the arms), I was toned up and wasn't shy to wear sleeveless tops and dress at my wedding and honeymoon! My friends who knew my big arms secret was amazed that I could tone up my arms. It's totally agony when doing the exercise but I think it's worth it when you know you can actually slim down and tone up the problem areas! I think my next project is to try out the legs exercise to see if I can be brave enough to wear mini skirts again! P.S. For those who reviewed that the music is terrible or Anderson has an annoying face etc, who cares if the exercise helps you lose weight!",1457913600,12,2034,4.151898734177215

Now I just recently discovered TA Mat Workout.  All you need is a yoga mat, a chair and a pair of 2-3 pound weights.  Her video is fun and I would say perfect for a beginner, like me.  The first time I did the video, I'll admit it was hard and the next day, I was sore but the good kind.  As I continue to workout along with this video, I start to get more into it and understand that working out, or some sort of physical activity is necessary!  The arms kill and I still have a hard time with the abs part.  But I enjoy watching Tracy, have fun and almost break out in dance moves.  LOL!",1456876800,2,743,4.13986013986014

3561365,4,B001F2HZHI,"So this is my first experience with a mat workout. I'm a month into it and for the most part really like it. As someone who has always believed you're not getting a real work out unless it's 30+ minutes of hard core cardio, this has been a big change for me. And don't let her loose long hair and interesting work out attire fool you, she kicks my butt. I'm not dripping in sweat, but I can definitely feel it in my abs, arms and butt.

There are a few things about the video that I hate, but overall find her less annoying than many of the other fitness gurus I've tried. The things I hate are that she can't count. I really wish she just wouldn't, rather than say ""5 more!"" and then do 9 more, or ""2 more"" and then do 1. It's very confusing and annoying. I also HATE the upper abs/dance session. It's incredibly hard to follow and replicate and I usually end up doing half of it before giving up. In the mat abs section, I really wish she could do a better job of saying what she's doing. It's very difficult to crane your neck to watch her while also trying to do crunchs, but if you don't you have no way of knowing when she changes from crunches to the various moves that incorporate legs, etc.

All in all, I feel like it's a beneficial work out and enjoy it, but there are a few areas she could improve really easily.",1454457600,2,1324,4.108108108108108

3561368,4,B001F2HZHI,Great work out video. Really exercises areas traditional work outs don't get to. I only give it 4 stars as it takes many times through at least for me to get it down.

If you hate your arms, you will probably love this, as she does TWO arm sections, one right after the other - first one of her iconic weightless sets of arm movements, and then one with weights. There is a standing ab set which I am not a huge fan of but this one actually made me break a light sweat. There is another ab section at the end which I loved, especially as there is a move for the lower abs.  You don't need a ton of space to do this workout either, as can happen with some of her floor workouts that have some eccentric moves. So this is definitely a good workout I will be coming back to.

Her music, after using the DVD  twice is enough to make you nuts. Very monotonous, generic, techno. I would just play my own music while exercising.

I didn't know much about Tracy Anderson or any of her methods. A friend recommended this DVD to me. I really wish I had read more reviews about her before I did this program..After some research, I learned that a lot of her repetitive motions are extremely harmful to the lower back.

I'm very pleased to have found this workout method.  I was leery to purchase this DVD after reading one of the reviews from a prior dancer.  I will say that the moves might seem a little awkward to get used to, but if you ever danced you understand controlling your movements is crucial.  That's what TA does, it's almost like a blend of dance and pilates - but not exactly (just try it!!!).

This workout makes me feel like I used to when I practiced choreography regularly.  Dancing is hard, but rewarding.  I highly recommend this DVD and am beyond grateful to have found something that gives me my dancer outlet without injuring my achilles.

I really love the standing waist/abs exercises that she does, because they are different than anything I've ever done and a lot of fun.  But there are things I don't like, starting with the arm workout.  Tracy tells us that we will feel like we have to stop at some point but we ""must"" keep going and work through the burn.  Well, I did that and after several months, I started having sharp burning pain in my shoulder when not exercising.  It is way too much shoulder work, and I believe pushing yourself that hard can lead to injury.  I later read on another review that someone tore their rotator cuff after doing Tracy Anderson workouts.  The advice should be to challenge yourself, but if it truly hurts, to stop. If you have lower back trouble, you will want to avoid the standing legwork, which led to a lot of lower back pain for me.  I enjoy the floor leg routine and the abs, but that is only half of the dvd.  Last but not least, Tracy Anderson seems madly in love with herself as she poses and pouts for the camera.

My fav DVDs are the Physique 57 (HIGHLY recommend) and my fav barre class is Dailey Method. I really wanted to like this. But the leg portion did nothing for me. It wasn't hard at all (to me) nor did i feel it the next day. I was doing it correctly given i've done barre for over 2 years now. I know the proper form. I don't want ""tiny arms"" but did the arm portion anyway. The weightless part maybe had merit. It was difficult, i'll give it that. But the weighted part seemed without purpose to me. I laughed at her during the standing ab portion. Is she for real? I thought i was on Candid Camera. No one can follow her; the camera angle was wrong and she gives NO instruction during it other than to ""follow me.""

So, I've been alternating both DVDs, practicing three to four times a week.

What I like about TA's Mat workout:
Her arms and abs sections are KILLER! Trust me. I'm not heavy-set yet far from ""athletic"" and although this DVD is not supposed to be heavy on toning, I have seen real results  in the two months and a half I've been doing them. If you truly pay attention to the technique (laid on the Beginner's DVD), becoming aware of  the ""opposite forces,"" yada, yada, yada, you'll be bringing PURPOSE to each movement.
There's also this sort of grounded yet fluid assertiveness about her approach and demeanor that make me read her as genuine.
She needs to seriously consider selling the entire track list for these sessions.  The music is simply PERRRFECT for workouts and everything else!

What can be improved:
Cuing for one.  She needs to be mindful of the different levels of abilities and skills of her prospective and current clientele base. Well, at least, the cuing is not completely MIA as it is in her Cardio Dance DVDs which I quickly sold back on Amazon.
TA could also dash more emphasis on how certain movements should look and feel, the where and the how never hurt.

Like everyone else who has done this and stuck to it as soon as you know it off by heart you'll be glad that she doesn't talk much.
I remember feeling so stupid doing the standing abs bit at first but one day it just clicks & you know what to do and how it's supposed to feel so if this bit puts anyone off just keep at it, nobody can be as uncoordinated as me & I grasped it!
Your legs, especially thighs will get tiny! Your hips will too & your hip bones will become visible. If you want to have curves then this isn't for you, she promotes the tiny dancer frame & stick at this & you'll get it!
Here's the bad news, it's gruelling to do it 6 times a week, I still dread the chair bit after a year of doing it (with a 3 month gap where I tried other things, went back to TA though) but it's at the beginning and I just say to myself 'get through this and the rest will fly by' which it does.
The music is quite relaxing and I find myself singing along. When you've done this a while the music will be your pointer of when to change position/side and you won't even need to look at the screen.
Do it :) it's great",1414022400,13,1291,3.8754716981132074

Feeling soreness in muscles I never knew I had,  abs that's awesome.  Tracy is terrible for at home instruction.  She changes up moves without ever mentioning or explaining how to do it.

I WISH it was divided up so I could more easily go to the different parts.

During the intro, with the sound turned off, I do my own favorite warm-ups, then her warm up and standing leg exercises, then I do my prescribed physio leg workout with a movie or documentary.

On alternate days, I do the leg warmup, the arm exercises without the weights, leaving energy to do my favorite: pushups of two different kinds,  shoulder stands and other floor exercises I like. So that's  45 minutes to an hour every day.

I thought Jane Fonda at seventy would be more my style but she's too slow.

used once or twice.  until this week Aug. 16.2014

I have many other ""exercise"" tools that have traveled with me over the years, that I was just ""not "" ready for, but now I am..

My background - wide - gymnastics, dance, ice skating, ballet, martial arts,  personal trainer, runner, resistance training, kickboxing..loved the cardio class..

 female, but always felt the more powerful, strong, tough energy - rather than the soft flowing energy in this body.

her lack of ""real"" formal instructions (like my brain is used to with ""western exercise""/  result driven, specific muscles or goals  - perfect form - become a 'rock'.. a 'machine' ) was frustrating, yet refreezing, because ""been there, done that""..  plus, since I'm getting older, and the heavy body building, running a mile or 2 a day,  days are gone..  Being a ""hard body "",  was fun, but now I want to learn to control my ""chi"" energy qi -  and flow , and still be strong as I get ""up"" there in the earthly numbers

I have started using this DVD daily now this week, and can feel and SEE the amazing changes in my energy flow, relaxation,  and the body itself.  Glad I am finally ready to push through the learning curve (of learning any thing new) and just ""do it""...  it ""comes' after we just repeat something over and over.  which is exactly what she says.

This DVD is great, it's split strangely, though, unlike her precision toning which is 4-15 min. segments, with a clear menu choice  which is great, you can ""stir up and activate your ""chi"" quickly and go.. don't even really need any ""tools"" weighs or workout ""outfit""...  if you are in a rush..

This one, though is a full ""program, you have to use FF to get to sections.."", and sections are kind of mixed in,
standing warm up: waist 5 min
standing legs / chair 15 min
standing abs 3 min
arms 31 min (weights and / or no weights)
legs / mat 5 min
abs / mat 5 min
cool down 2 min

I feel my energy flowing in my body like never before after just a few uses this week.. I do 30 minutes a day usually of something ( I have a wide collection of DVD's on all the disciplines I still enjoy - and the only other one that comes close is KATA in the Combat DVD collection.

This is like learning how to use my wings in the arms section, and bring in energy I want, and push away energy I do not want.  Same with the legs , butt and abs... Her angles are hard to see often with the camera guys (I bet) focusing on certain areas of her body, but I thought maybe she wants that , so we focus on our own energy, and not outside comparison...  To feel what is happening in my own body, rather than try to look just like her.  She explained the angles very clearly, and to learn those take time, but by doing, we learn, and we learn by doing... its very TAO - energy flow, opening blocked areas of the body -  I did arms twice yesterday  -  I've always had long arms , large scapula and shoulder bones, and also tend to build muscle very quickly there with traditional pushup / weight type exercise, which actually has limited my ability to use my energy correctly my whole life...

so this is transforming, if you are ready for the ride, or have that flowing, soft, energy already, and just want to get in shape - this is great for you...  No matter what, I believe if you don't like it, wait, and maybe you'll be ready one day, or gift it to someone

If you're ready to spread your wings and fly - and learn to ""feel"" your body, and feel the energy flowing in your body, and start getting really comfortable from inside out - -  from the energy -- flowing - this is for you...

I have a few of her other ones as well.. and they are different but similar. I know now why she calls them metamorphosis..  it's spiritually mentally and physically calming - I have felt more peace and a grounding relaxing sense of my energy than I can ever remember!!",1408147200,6,3878,4.270233196159122

3561542,5,B001F2HZHI,"Initially purchased this DVD to use post pregnancy but wanted to preview it first.  I've still got 3 months until delivery but I'm pretty good at modifying most fitness plans to make them safer for my ever growing body and since the bulk of this video is done standing there was very little modification needed, in fact there are only a few on your stomach mat movements near the end of the video that can't be done pregnant.  I've been doing this workout about twice a week now and I can honestly say it has greatly improved my quality of life.  I had been experiencing insane lower or lumbar back pain and extreme hip pain, the hip pain more than anything was keeping me from sleeping at night and my doctor just blamed it on progesterone, estrogen, and relaxin and said unfortunately I'd have to deal with the pains till delivery.  I'm happy to report she was wrong.  After two weeks of doing this video my back pain was gone and my hip pain was mild, after a full month of the video all pain is gone.  My hip pain had been excruciating, it was keeping me up at night and making my want to cry at my manual labor job. Forget sitting down or sleeping, everything but standing was horrible and no hot or cold compress seemed to help.  I really believe the standing leg exercises in this video did wonders for my hips.  I was also glad she has you use a chair to complete the routine, made it a lot safer for my growing bump than trying to balance on one foot would have been.  Having come from Jillian Michaels type routines to this video was a bit of a culture shock but I got through it and the benefits to my sitting, resting, sleeping are unmeasurable.",1407456000,2,1657,4.319354838709677
3561543,4,B001F2HZHI,"I have been working with Tracy's dvds for about 4 months and have seen noticable differences in my muscular structure. She definitely knows what she is talking about - proof is in the pudding, so to speak. She very clearly states that it is essential to ""learn"" the workouts, and she also states that the results are in the details. So, even if she isn't giving constant instruction, paying attention to the subtle angles and placements of limbs can and does make a difference in results. I have a dance and fitness background and I can attest to the fact that Tracy's method is different because it doesn't bulk. I have a problem with this big time, and I'm not bulking! Having said all this, Listen to your body - be smart! Start slow, if you need to, to avoid injury and to get used to the movements. If you need to, watch or read tutorials on movements or excersises you don't understand. Also, if you have low back pain, make sure you are supporting with your core (center, abs). Try starting with less reps and always stop if you feel ""bad"" pain. I have suffered for a long time from sciatica, so all her hip and glute work is challenging for me, but having strenth around the lower back is important for stabilizing the hips, so I do what I can and I am definitely getting stronger (no bulk) and defined. My arms are finally looking slim again - yay! So, I am saying that any result worth getting takes time and diligence. If Tracy's method isn't your cup of tea that's fine, but for me it is delivering what it promises, so it's worth the effort of making sure Im doing the excersises how she intends them to be done. Otherwise, i have noone to blame but myself ;-)",1407369600,3,1673,4.382636655948553

You can't help but have your arms change, tone and get stronger if you do both exercises back to back 4 to 5 days a week. After a month, I got comments and am still getting them over a year later. This is my second purchase of the DVD, the first one fizzled out after 1 year. The leg exercises are good, too, but my cellulite is really stubborn so I've had to move on to other methods. However, the leg exercises are great for improving flexibility. The sit-ups section I continue to use every day, it really works. My metabolism has slowed way down, so it took me over 6 months to really strengthen, but I kept at it. I find this DVD easy to follow and I will keep the arms exercises forever.

Bought her mat workout in the winter of 2012. Yes, my review is based on my past almost two year of  following this DVD routine at least twice a week.
Her methods are so different from any others out there. Her workout seems easy but it is really not at all, the arm movements are quite challenging even till this day. I wasn't able to finish the arm workout &  had to rest from time to time when I first started the DVD. Oh, yes my arms were burning, they still do. Any workout you need to feel the burn for it to work, I am sure most would agree with me.
I admit, her cue is not there so that you need pay attention to her on the screen throughout the entire series. Yet once I am familiar with the routines, it's no longer an issue for me. Yeah, you will find her counts on reps are different from time to time on each side, but I just keep counts myself. I love her ab works, it is unique, short but get the job done. If you are someone looking for a workout that targets those saddle bags, try her leg works. It is good.

3561568,5,B001F2HZHI,"I bought Tracy Anderson's Mat Workout DVD based on the recommendation of a friend when I told her I wanted to get in shape for a friend's wedding. She recommended it specifically for the arm portion. I ended up liking the entire workout SO much more than I anticipated, and it basically inspired me to get serious about fitness and my overall health.

I'm in my mid/late twenties and prior to this DVD I had never done any type of strength training on my own. The only workout I had ever stuck with was running, and I pretty much had been mostly inactive for about 5 years when I bought this. The mast workout turned out to be a fantastic way to wake up my muscles and start moving, especially for someone like me who hates the gym and working out with other people. I could do this in the comfort of my own home and go at my own pace, and other than a mat, a chair and arm weights it doesn't require special equipment. For the arm section I started out with no weights (even for the weighted portion) and gradually moved to 3 lbs. Eventually I also added ankle weights as well.

I think that the overall chill vibe of the video was a huge factor for getting me to stick with it. It is soothing and relaxing yet still a great workout, and I really like that it's only Tracy and that she doesn't talk too much. I know many other users view that as a flaw, but I really liked that it forced me to pay attention to the details in the rotations and I think the video would have worn on me faster if she was cueing more. Like others, I grew tired of the music but it was easy to find appropriate substitutes that went well with the content. I will admit that the standing ab section is pretty ridiculous and you feel silly doing it, but once your core is strong you can definitely feel the benefit. I'm glad that I kept with it and didn't skip that section just because I didn't feel the burn right away.

I should mention two changes in my body that I have noticed aside from the expected/desired results. For as long as I can remember I have had pain in my right shoulder when I run, and it disappeared after doing this workout for a few weeks. I believe it has also helped me deal with my runners' knee (in both knees) since it focuses on developing accessory muscles (root of runners' knee is over-development of the main muscles used for running).

I have since moved on to Tracy's Precision Toning DVD but I go back and do the Mat Workout once every week or two as a little treat because I miss it so much. Overall it is a great introduction to Tracy and I am so glad I decided to use it.",1397433600,8,2589,4.182364729458918
3561569,5,B001F2HZHI,"I love this workout DVD! In the past 25 days my arms have gotten so toned and, in general, my body is more powerful! I really enjoyed the music as well. The only thing I did not like is that sometimes Tracy doesn't tell you when to switch sides on the mat ab work. Other than that, if you are looking for a workout where the instructor is not cheesy or corny and you get awesome results, then this is the workout for you!

I've a tendency to push harder to keep following her until she switches, instead of thinking, ""Seriously, I am only on 20 and I have to make it to 40!""  It is one of her easiest DVD's to follow as there are not as many ""angles"" to hit, as in her other's.  My 61 year old Mom does this one with me and enjoys it.  There is no way she could do the Precision Toning DVD though, as that is much more advanced and harder on one's knees.

Cardio I usually can handle on my own, but I'm at a loss with strength or circuit. This workout is great. You will feel it in places you haven't felt it before. It's not very hard to follow, none of the moves are crazy. Just different positions and movements that you're probably not going to be used to. You'll pick them up quickly. She's not the greatest at talking you through it, so you really do have to make sure to pay attention. She sometimes switches moves and doesn't verbally say it. This is one of her earlier DVDs and I think she probably has gotten better. In any case, I always get good results. I've tried her Dance Cardio and it's way too hard to follow for anyone who isn't already a dancer. She says in the interviews on this DVD to only do this and her Dance Cardio but I don't do that. I mix it with my own cardio and other at home DVDs (like Jillian Michaels.) This will still get you good lean muscle definition.",1394668800,,1112,4.3
3561584,3,B001F2HZHI,"I am on week 4 using this DVD, of about 3-4x per week.
Of course no weight loss or noticeable changes yet. She does recommend doing it 5-6x per week for a month though.
What is frustrating to me is she gives barely any direction. If your eyes aren't glued on her you will be left on a past move. She is just popping along like we all have the routine down to memory. Very frustrating. It's difficult to properly stretch with your head down if you have to look at the tv. People don't need endless talking just state what the move is and when to change moves.
She doesn't do the same amount of repetition per side or sometimes not even the moves in the same order. I would recommend starting on a different side each time you do the DVD so it will even out.
And since you need to keep your eyes glued to the tv, you are watching her the entire time. She does pouty lips, rolls her eyes, occasionally looks at herself in the window glass, the warm up and cool down is not effective.
Oh, and the stand up stomach moves are a joke. She is doing a dance routine you expect to see at a show. No one could possibly follow this..skip past it.
I can't yet recommend to buy or not buy because I can get past all this if it actually works.
If it doesn't work it will just add to the overall review.",1394409600,3,1287,4.070866141732283
3561585,4,B001F2HZHI,Ok this video is very good.  Challenging enough but not impossible.  Not high cardio.  Great for toning lower and upper body.  multiple reps for upper body exercises really challenging.  Feel like your arms will fall off. Sensual music throughout is good to work out to although can be quite humorous too as you watch her ( Tracey Anderson) get into her workout.  My friend recommended this video to me and she has been doing it faithfully for quite some time ( and she looks great) .  She had back surgery before and so she loves this video because it is low impact.  I have recommended this video to multiple people who have bought it and enjoy it.  The main problem with this video is the way it is put together.  What I mean it you can't jump to arm section or floor mat section as it is not broken up into those chapters and so you have to fast forward through a section  instead of just easily going to the ab section.  I wish she would remake this video and make it easier to navigate through if you only have time for upper or lower body for example.

3561589,1,B001F2HZHI,"I didn't give this DVD workout a chance to see if the workout claimed to do what Tracy said it would because I couldn't get past the poor instruction of the workout routines.  It's clear Tracy is more experienced working one-on-one with clients than she is instructing via a video workout.  She doesn't give clear instructions on the moves, rarely gives examples and is on the the next routine before letting you know she's going to do this.  She also doesn't let you know how many reps of the moves you're doing so you can at least anticipate that there will be a different move coming. No instruction whatsoever on breathing techniques while exercising.

Tracy doesn't measure up to Jeanette Jenkins or Denise Austin when it comes to showing proper technique and instruction.",1392681600,,777,4.819548872180451
3561590,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have ordered everything known to man on workout tapes, machines ect. I have never in my life, saw such a transformation as Tracey has done for me.
I am 49 years old and was size 13 when I started, and now am size 9. Yes I have been cutting my Carbs, Calories, and Fat, which is key to lose weight. But I have lost weight before, and had looser skin, I am toned on my belly and inches have dissapeared, my arms (which have always been bulky) are toned and slimmer, my thighs slimmer, and hip fat is dissapearing. I have been doing it 3 days a week, Mon-Wed-Friday, and do a 30 min Cardio/workout 2 days a week I also threw in 100 squats a day, and do some xtra stomach excerses at night. I have dropped 2 sizes (started in October) but the difference in my stomach is amazing. Nothing I was doing  before slimmed my stomach. That midlife bulge I was getting is all but dissapearing. I am so impressed with her workout, that I just went and bought her new set of the Metamorphosis Videos, mine was Hip Centric. Have not tried yet but trying tomorrow.
The one lady that wrote yes it took me 6 weeks to get throught the whole workout, well the arms, but after awhile it is worth the results..Kudos to Tracey! Cant say enough about this, but with anything it is no miracle cure if you are not watching your sugar, fat, Carb, and Calorie intake.

I recommend starting out with sections, do the chair leg work-out and then start where you left off the next day with arms, and back to legs and abs.  The ab workout doesn't feel like much but I hurt for 3 days...so it's obviously good.  I've lost 5 lbs already and I feel and look great.  I'm still not doing the whole thing at once but a little every day will work and get results too.  My only issue with her is that she doesn't talk a lot so I'm having to look at the screen to see what to do next, and that can be hard when you're upside down, LOL, but aside from that, she's awesome!

3561598,1,B001F2HZHI,"I purchased this last week- not from Amazon- and after doing the workout, I felt I needed to share my thoughts. This is a very, very strange workout. Anderson seems distracted and not quite with her ""class"" and she does not have any set numbers of reps. If you own this, try counting! Sometimes you do 14, another time 19, another time 17, another time 24- if one is switching some side to side, any class I have taken it has always been same reps of each particular exercise/set. Every once in a while, she will pipe up some generic phrase, but there are no prompts at all and her moves seem very disjointed and do not transition well. She tells you to get your weights out, and then starts other exercises and I am going, ""Um, aren't we doing weights?"" She does not seem comfortable, consistent or even safe for some of her moves. She likes to gyrate around in some weird stripper/belly dancer moves, but again, they do not transition well, and I would not advise anyone with back, or hip problems to use this.

I did feel a burn in my hips doing some of the first set of lower body work and thought I might feel it today, but no. Perhaps because I spin twice a week as well as walk/jog? I am going to give it another try or so, if only to figure out what she is doing and how to transition/expect her next moves. She is building quite a business for herself, but I consider the $7.99 I spent a waste of money. There are way too many other qualified, safe instructional dvd's out there to waste time on this one.",1390953600,2,1514,4.256944444444445

However, I must give it 5 starts because it really works and you see dramatic results in very short time. I turned to Tracy Anderson's method after I gave birth fearing that I will never recover after a serious weight gain and stretched abdominal muscles. In only 4-6 weeks I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight and in 8 I weighed as much as I did in 9th grade and I was in the best shape in my life! All my friends were shocked and I was quite surprised myself. So yes, very very effective! The only other workout that I have found as effective is Callanetics.",1390953600,4,731,4.191489361702128
3561600,5,B001F2HZHI,This is one of the most enjoyable workouts I have ever done! I relied on it to stay in shape after a foot injury and it became a fast favorite. I really didn't like Metamorphisis but this one is very soothing as well as challenging. I especially love the unique arm work and the abs work on the Mat I love-I usually hate abs work because I'm very weak in that area but this was manageable and I really felt it.,1390608000,,410,4.074074074074074
3561611,5,B001F2HZHI,"I've been doing this workout for about 2 weeks (probably about 8 times total).  Everything that you read in all of the other reviews is true...it's weird...it's odd...the arm section is completely different than anything you've done.  The music you'll either love or hate (I love it).

FYI there is the full mat workout DVD in sections on youtube, so I tried that before ordering.  But I liked it so much, I ordered the DVD.  For the cost of one in-person class, you can have this in your rotation.

The results?  ""Something"" is happening.  My arms feel different, I feel a little ""tighter"".  And I've become really interested in all of the folks that have tried her method and their experiences.  Is it amazing?  No, but I dig it.

I find this workout enjoyable, and relaxing while also being hard.  Looking forward to results after a more extended period of time and will amend the review.",1390435200,6,891,4.634615384615385
3561612,4,B001F2HZHI,"I bought this because I was looking for something different in my workout.  First off, I have a unique nerve pain issue that makes typical high intensity workouts impossible.  I'm always looking for things that still work my muscles with less cardio to it.  This workout does not have a high cardio aspect to it at all.  I have used Abs, buns, arms of steel in the past.  I like the variety of this video.  The abs section actually made me feel somewhat sexy with the moves she uses.  I have seen some reviews that say this is boring.  I didn't find it boring at all.  It reminds me of a modern dance/ballet/hip hop video.  She does not give a lot of instruction but she advises you to watch it through before trying.  The more I do the video, the easier the moves get.  I think as long as you are moving through most of it, then you'll get a decent workout.  I'm excited to try the metamorphosis workout for more variety.",1390435200,2,922,4.290697674418604
3561613,3,B001F2HZHI,"I think my neck is more sore than the rest of me after this one. I literally just finished this work-out for the first time. Does it work? Yes, the only reason why it got more than 1 star is that I do feel muscles burning that I haven't, I am good sore for the most part. That said, it was so boring. Tracy herself looks bored through most of the dvd. I have never wanted to sit down and fall asleep so badly during a work-out. The music is calm and she rarely talks so it's hard to stay motivated.
I saw all the reviews about her not explaining and figured I'd still give it a try. THEY ARE RIGHT! It is a serious pain in the neck to have to constantly look up while doing these exercises in order to see what she is doing. During the standing abs I really think she just stood there dancing, no real instruction, no pattern, no way to memorize it. I was going to buy one of her programs and I am glad I bought this dvd first because this obviously is not the method for me.
Did I mention it's an hour long? An hour isn't so bad for a work-out, I've done hour long work-outs where it doesn't feel like all that long...every second of that hour I was wondering when it would be over. Not because of how tired I was but more because of how bored I was. I wish this dvd was broken into sections because I would love to use her mat abs on a regular basis and do other dvds for the rest of my body
Advantages-
Like I said, I do feel it. I feel it in a lot of the normal muscles but also ones that don't get a work-out with traditional work-outs.
Definitely not high impact so it is good for people who have issues with their joints.",1390348800,,1628,3.981651376146789

Im used to doing Insanity 3 days a week and jogging plus some bodyrock/zuzka workouts the other days with a day alternating this video with a Jillian Michaels that I have.

She is right when she says doing the DVD will give you ""ballet arms"".  I only do this DVD 2 to 3 times per week even though she recommends 4-6 times. My whole body is leaner.  I am still eating normally and do not do any other exercise.  Since starting this 3 months ago, I have lost about 8 pounds.  My clothes fit much better and have gone down 1 size.  Like I said, I am only doing this 2-3 times per week and still eating normally (not dieting). There have been weeks where I've only done it once.  The only thing I could complain about is that she is not always consistent in her reps.  She will do 8 reps on one arm, and on the other arm, do 12 reps.  Just a little annoyance.  I don't like doing the ab exercises where it just seems like you are dancing around, but I have seen a difference in my abs.

3561640,2,B001F2HZHI,"I really wish I liked this video more because I love the short youtube videos of Tracy's workouts which are very focused on technique and proper form.  The video is dramatically different (who would have thought that youtube videos would have better production quality?) as the cuing is non-existent or very quiet and there is no talk about proper technique, which is pretty critical for a lot of the leg work that she does.  The editing and videography is also really poor with bad lighting, poor angles and big pauses of a blank screen (""Are we done? Yes? Wait, No. She's back."").

She only talks a couple of times, to mention that she doesn't approve of heavy weights because they ""add bulk"" (which they don't) and to say ""I know this is hard but keep going"" in a completely flat voice. Typically I don't care what the instructor is wearing or looks like but she has this constantly annoyed and somewhat pouty look on her face the whole time. I couldn't tell if she was bored or trying to look sexy for the camera, but it was really weird and put me off quite a bit.

It sucks that Tracy's persona in this video and the editing are so poor - some of the moves are great but if you can't hear the transitions, what's the point?  There are tons of great ballet/mat work videos out there (the Exhale videos make my legs BURN) that this just isn't worth my time.",1387238400,4,1361,4.4063745019920315
3561641,4,B001F2HZHI,"I am using this video to get back in shape after having a baby, and most of this workout is really great. I like that she gives clear instructions about the moves she is doing, and they are easy to follow for the most part. The only difficult part that left me confused is the ab/ribcage rotation section, she says ""just follow what I do"" then starts moving all over the place - it left me confused and flailing around like a psycho in my living room trying to follow her moves, and obviously failing. I admit that I am not the most coordinated-person, so it was clearly user error on my part, but I would have been able to follow it with a bit more instruction - she just left me hanging! Next time I will just skip over that part - it's really the only one that I found lacking in instructions.

What I do NOT like about this video, however, is Gwyneth Paltrow's interview - I'm not sure why it's included on this DVD, since it's totally useless. Don't even waste your time watching it. She makes a statement about how many women say they don't have a lot of time to exercise because they have kids and are working full time, then goes on to say that she has kids and works full time, but you just have to make it a priority like she does. Sure, that would be useful advice if everyone could afford to pay nannies to watch our kids so we can work out for 2+ hours a day, like she does. She just sounds out of touch with reality - most of us don't have full time help to watch our kids, and we can't just leave them screaming and crying while we finish up a 1 hour workout DVD. Luckily, this video can be paused and done in short segments (it's broken up into legs, arms, abs, etc, so you could do one section at a time) if needed so that you can attend to your kids if they need you.

My muscles definitely feel it the day after doing this workout, and I am seeing some changes in my muscle tone, so the workout is effective. The only 'gear' you need is a chair and a light pair of weights - although you can do it without the weights if needed. I like her approach to exercise as well - it's all about working smaller muscle groups, not just the major groups. Her approach is more interesting and fun than a lot of the major workout videos on there. She has more of a dancer's approach to exercise - fluid movements, moving the whole body and getting into the music rather than just remaining static and only moving the arms or legs or whatever area you are working on, which makes this video fun to do!",1387152000,4,2506,4.143737166324435

I take her ""You're lucky I deem you worthy enough to watch me"" attitude over bubbly obnoxious, but not by much. Her cuing is poor and it is hard to watch the TV for many of these exercises. What makes this a once a year workout for me is that it ALWAYS irritates a back issue I have been dealing with for years. It takes about a year for me to convince myself that I imagined it, but for someone who claims her ""research"" helped her deal with a back issue this is just so wrong on so many levels. This is seemingly low impact, but winds up hurting me more than most of the turbo jumpy stuff I used to do. I really just don't get why she is so popular.

Unlike my other workout DVDs, I can feel good doing this any time of the day or night. If I didn't get to the other workouts before noon, they were torturous to do because I guess they are really quite tedious and boring. With TA, the moves are more dance/ballet oriented. Adding the small portions of this workout from Youtube already significantly changed my arms and legs/rear over the summer. I'm a lot stronger since focusing more on the TA workouts. I can tell my core is really responding. It's hard work, but TA makes it seem fun and possible to do several times a week.

I agree with the other reviewers about the poor cueing.  The lack of cueing during the mat abs portion is particularly frustrating because you aren't looking at the TV screen.  After doing the workout enough times, you start to know how many reps to do.... but here's another frustration:  Tracy often doesn't do equal sets on both sides.

That said, I've worked out to videos since the '90s (Buns of Steel w/Greg Smithey and Tamilee Webb, Tae Bo, Winsor Pilates, Kathy Smith's aeroboxing, and various ballet DVDs), and this -- though advertised on the package as an introduction to her mat series -- has the worst cuing and videography of any workout video I've done. Oftentimes, Tracy is silent. This is particularly unhelpful when, during the warmup, you're bent over and unable to see the television.
During the workout, the chair she uses for balance blocks the finer points of what she's doing - which means you could either injure yourself or not get the full benefit of the workout.
I also get the feeling Tracy doesn't like her right side being photographed. Even though she begins each set of exercises on that side, the camera never pans in that direction so you can see what she's doing. Again: not helpful.
Lastly, she says herself that she doesn't like ""that six-pack abs look,"" so if that's what you're going for, you may want to skip this.
Hope this helps.",1384992000,2,1189,4.69377990430622
3561649,5,B001F2HZHI,"This workout is amazing!  Tracy explains the theory behind the moves, which I appreciate because I'm one who likes to understand The Big Picture.  Conceptually it is intelligent and for me, a unique way to work muscles that I have unintentionally ignored by doing traditional, repetitive ""large muscle"" workouts.  Trainers have advised that ""women don't build bulk"" or something like that, but it is not true for me.  Genetically speaking, my family members and I build muscle quickly and I have become bulky in places I did not want to!  This workout promises to repair that ""damage"" (my word, not hers) and build strength while leaving muscles with feminine lines.

Based on the reviews I've read, some people have quit before really exploring what this workout is about, based upon how the instructor looks when she's doing it.  If you merely watch the instructor do the arm portion, for example, and don't participate, yes, you might say it looks ridiculous.  But if you actually DO THE WORK for as long as she's doing it--or even for a fraction of the time--your arms will be ON FIRE!  And you'll see results.  Any fat you may have near the elbow or across the top of the arm, for example, will quickly disappear.  The arm workout is 16 minutes long: 8 minutes without weights and 8 minutes with.  The 2 arm series not only hit the actual small muscle groups within the arm, but the muscle across the bust, under the arms and across the back.  You will probably lose a bra band size very quickly.  (I can't even do the arm series standing all the time, but you can do it seated with the same results.)

All muscle series in the workout create fast and encouraging results.  You'll be stronger more quickly than you ever thought possible.  That hourglass shape I took for granted in my twenties now must be sculpted with the right exercises.  The standing and floor ab series are the ONLY AB EXERCISES I've ever done that have been meaningful in the way I feel, and the results I see.

She works the legs and butt for a very long time, but unfortunately, does not hit the quads, nor the inner thigh muscles in a way that is clear to me.  All the twisting and repetition in the floor leg series seems a bit redundant because there are a few standing moves in ""Callanetics"" that cover that territory in a fraction of the time. The inner thigh in both ""Callanetics"" and this Tracy Anderson workout is still up for grabs, however, but that is the only complaint I have about this.

I would suggest watching the whole thing before you do it because she does not count for you, nor does she always explain the angles at which she's moving.  Therefore, it's important to observe first.",1384819200,8,2682,4.578616352201258

 I know that she doesn't always do the same number of reps on both sides, but how hard is it for us to just decide to do 20 or 30 on each side and I just jog in place 'til she gets finished really overdoing that one side?

I've gotten my daughter and daughter in law ""hooked"" on this and several friends, since the results speak for themselves.  In fact, I bought this one for a friend.",1383523200,6,563,3.9557522123893807
3561673,4,B001F2HZHI,"I have used this DVD for awhile now. It is my go-to workout 3 or 4 nights a week after work. There are some annoying aspects of this film, the editing and music involved (my opinion) but I cannot argue that the program is working and I feel great afterwards. I have been an insomniac for years. I find that doing this workout relaxes my entire body enough to sleep soundly, which is an unexpected bonus. Most wouldn't recommend working out before bed, but it works great for me! It has also visibly improved my muscle tone in a short period of time. The upper arm portion is particularly effective. I understand the theory behind 'accessory muscles' and you will see that you are never just working out one set of muscles. Working the legs also works the abs and vice versa...My body feels as if every inch has been worked (hence the total relaxation afterwards). I have found the mat workout to be addicting (something I never thought I'd say about an exercise routine).Tracy could work on her delivery. She fumbles with words and does not describe things clearly. Not a biggie, because you WILL figure it out for yourself. I am 53 and have some joint issues, but I am able to adapt to this workout just fine without damaging anything! My flexibility and strength are improving daily! I can see and feel a difference. I am eager to see just how far I can go with this!!!",1383350400,3,1371,4.488
3561674,5,B001F2HZHI,"I own/do a lot of video workouts including yoga, cardio, weights, etc.  I have to say that this workout is one of the best I have ever owned.  The workout thoroughly works your entire body, and is very challenging while also smooth and even relaxing.  Most importantly, I feel like the workout is very safe.  Tracy Anderson, and the background music, are pleasant to listen to.  She does not talk too much (in fact talks very little).  Over the years I have bought workout DVDs that I've either given away, or thrown out, simply because the person leading you is incredibly obnoxious to listen to (ex: the Butt Bible with Pauling Nordin who has an incredily unpleasant voice, says the same stupid things over and over (like ""make love to your butt"") and continually bad mouths other workouts throughout the DVD).

In short, I highly recommend this workout.",1383350400,,856,4.743243243243243
3561675,4,B001F2HZHI,"This offers a great workout. I am getting back in shape after baby #2 and this is definitely touch, even for someone who is in pretty good shape. I have practiced pilates for the last 4 years, and this offers quite a challenge!
 I wouldn't recommend this if you don't catch on quickly in classes, as she offers very little instruction and almost no cues when she is changing what you are supposed to be doing, so you have to continually keep your eye on the screen.
Also, the music is kind of boring, but it does fit the workout rhythm.
Tracy seems like a bit of a snob... not a pro or con, just something I noticed :) ( which may be a nice change if the regular perky workout instructors annoy you!)
overall, a great dvd to have in your library, offers different variations than you'll find in most classes or videos.",1383177600,,818,4.311688311688312
3561676,5,B001F2HZHI,"This is a toning exercise workout structured in a similar way than pilates or barre workouts. By this, I mean that it is made up of standing or floor exercises mainly using your own body (sometimes you use light weights, but that's it). There are several series of repetitions of the same exercises, which are rather slow. The only differences I could see to other barre or toning DVD's is that for example the arms toning exercises are done combined with some hip and leg movements that give you a sort of ""dancy feeling"" and that some of the exercises are performed as if you would like to reach a ""pose"" for some theater musical finale, instead of doing some exercise. Strangely, this made the workout a lot less boring for me and I was not counting the time to the end; I went through the whole DVD quite ok. It felt as if the exercises had some purpose (although a very strange one indeed, it feels weird to mimic her, but somehow this helped me through the reps). I had not the impression that Tracy was bored as some reviewers suggest, it rather looks as if she was concentrated on doing the exercises (or poses) herself, so she doesn't talk too much. Do not expect her to cheer you, to count the reps for you or to give a lot of instruction; on the other hand the exercises are fairly easy, so I think it's ok. During the warm up you reach to the floor with your hands and your head is looking down, so you can't see the screen; here a little more cueing as to when to stand up again or turn the other side would be helpful, but don't worry, during almost the rest of the workout you can see what she is doing and the beats of the music are also guiding you.

Now, if you listen to Tracy's interview on the DVD, she says that the difference in her method is that she first ""exhausts"" your long muscles by a series of reps and then she introduces some unusual rotations to the same basic exercise, to pull in and ""wake up"" your small muscles, so that they help elongate your long muscles. So this is precisely what she does in the DVD, if it gives the announced results I will tell you after some more using the DVD. So far I can only say it is a good, thorough and doable workout (as background I need to say that I really do not like working out; as of today, I only manage to do dance fitness DVD's without giving up).

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low  TONING: Medium to high  CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: None  INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Scarce  MUSIC: Good pop music FUN FACTOR: Good (much better than expected for a repetition based workout).

SAFETY: I think this is one of the safest DVD's I have used. I have a knee injury and there are always some exercises in the workouts where one of my knees tells me ""hey watch-out how you perform this exercise or you will have trouble with me!"", with this DVD my knees are quite OK. There are some squats and plies, but they are performed slowly, so you can watch out for your form.

CONTENT:
- Warm up - the warm up is rather short but I think it is quite effective
- Two standing leg series with a chair for support - The exercises start very similar to some barre or other standing ballet based exercises (Tracy Mallet, Andrea Lee Rogers, Jennifer Gallardi, Kary Anderson, etc.), but continue the repetitions adding some unusual twists and rotations (Tracy Mallet also does some unusual twists).
- One standing abs series - This part consist exclusively in rib cage isolations like the ones done in bellydance DVD's, but without the ""oriental"" look. Here they are performed more like a modern pop (club) dance. I have seen them also a bit different in some hip-hop DVD's. This part might look strange, but in my opinion it's effective and good for your abs. Specially if you do not like crunches, like myself, these exercises might be a good alternative. Some reviewers said that she was moving all over without cueing and it was difficult to follow. I agree, but after 2-3 times you will notice that it's not so random, if you listen to the music you will understand when it's single or double and in the end, the main thing is that you also keep moving your ribcage.
- Two arm segments, one with and one without weights - The arms segments in this DVD are quite good, they are somewhat similar to those found in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xtend-Barre-Lean-Chiseled/dp/B004Z6IGJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xtend Barre: Lean & Chiseled</a>&nbsp;and probably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skinny-Sculpt-with-Ellen-Barrett/dp/B0037LKWCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skinny Sculpt with Ellen Barrett</a>, it's just that Tracy's segments are a bit longer and with a bit more different moves. On top you repeat the whole bunch of moves a couple of times.
- One leg segment on the mat - These segment is very similar to the exercises done by Kary Anderson in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kari-Anderson-Angles-Lines-and-Curves/dp/B005215QOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kari Anderson: Angles Lines and Curves</a>, with the difference that in Kari's DVD the leg stretching exercises are part of the routine, so when you finish Kari's DVD your legs feel fantastic, whereas with Tracy the feeling is more like that of a regular toning workout.
- One abs (crunches) segment on the mat - I normally do not like cruches, but these are doable (maybe it's the music). It's somewhat similar to other crunch sessions but there are one or two exercises that I find different; they are also a bit easier on your lower back than other sessions (no scissor twisting of the legs while crunching). As mentioned I find this DVD quite safe for my specific problem areas (knees and lower back).
- Cool down - this is very similar to the warm up, it uses exactly the same type of exercises, so it's good, but for cooling down I'd rather prefer some stretching exercises.

MUSIC: Soft Pop and electronic music, nothing intrusive; normally these are not my preferred music genres, but the selection integrates very well with the routines. It is evident that Tracy put some thought into the music selection, which is something I always appreciate from an instructor (be it your music choice or not, when the music has been ""selected"" for the workout, everything makes an integrated whole and it makes a difference).

EMPHASIS:
Toning legs, glutes, arms and abs.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:
+ The music selection blends perfectly with the exercises
+ You do not feel exhausted after the workout, like in other workouts
+ Toning from different angles of each muscle

(Jan 2014) P.D. I would need to subtract one star for poor production quality. The various segments were not recorded as chapters but as one single routine. At the beginning I had not noticed it, since I normally run the full DVD, but one day I got interrupted by the phone and I could not go to the segment I was working with. I needed to forward it from the beginning. This is annoying, specially if you would like to exercise only one part of your body. However, despite of this minus, I would still buy this DVD again.",1382400000,4,7144,4.803905614320586

The abs section is ok and I really like the leg section really gets at those saddlebags from all angles. My favorite part would probably be the warm up, I love the fluid motions it makes me feel relaxed and ready.
Everyone is right on lack of instruction, she doesn't even tell you when she's moved on to the next side most of the time so the first few times of doing it your constantly looking up at the TV screen but after awhile you remember the flow and it's a really great addition to my workout schedule for toning. Definitely feel worked at the end.

I wasn't sore the next day, but I could really feel my muscles working during the workout. However, this is one of the most irritating programs I've ever experienced. I'm not sure who she's trying to impress, but Tracy spends the whole time acting overly sexy. Her actions are so ridiculous I can hardly take it. I know she's being serious, but you'll probably get a good laugh from it so there's that. Furthermore, she doesn't really provide much instruction. You just kind of watch and hope what you're doing is close to what she's doing. The core/ribs part is by far the most ridiculous. She tells you to imagine your ribs are on a table and that's it and then she moves around from unpredictable angles. Trying to do what she was doing when I had no clue what she was doing felt embarrassing even though I was totally alone. I will probably do the workout again just because it did feel good at certain points (especially during the arms portion) but I have a feeling it will eventually end up in the box of random multimedia going to the Used Media Store.

I'm pretty sure she made the standing ab routine up as she went. Make sure you count reps otherwise your one leg will get more of a workout than the other.

Yes Tracy does kind of ""do her own thing"" sometimes and lacks cuing but I think for the first couple times of any workout you have to really pay attention to what anybody is doing to get it down.  It can seem a little boring after awhile I must admit because the music is rather slow and she barely talks, but I think I will listen to what another reviewer said and play my own music since you really don't have to listen to her anyway.  She does make some odd sexual type faces and at some points I thought a stripper pole might come out but whatever just ignore it.  The biggest complaint I have though is that although it was hard on my muscles and I struggled through at some points I don't feel like I got much of a workout.  Maybe Im too cardio focused and that's why.  But I really don't have the time to do an hour long cardio session then this hour long workout like she tells you to.  So I don't really know what to say about it.  Wish there was a happy medium here.  I might try the beginners dvd and see how that goes since they are 2 30 minute workouts.",1378252800,,1433,4.115107913669065

3561731,5,B001F2HZHI,"I am not usually much of a reviewer unless I am 100% backing up the product. The TAM is absolutely incredible. I have been doing the MAT DVD as well as the first Post Pregnancy DVD for over a year now. I usually interchange them because the ab workout in the Post Pregnancy is incredible for getting those sexy lean abs back especially after having a baby but the arm workout is more difficult in the MAT DVD. I have a 4 year old and a 14 month old and I lost all my weight with my second son plus and extra 10 pounds by the time he was 10 months old using the TAM method. I was usually a runner but I slowed down(nothing crazy 5K no more than 5 miles) on running because the leg method was giving me toned legs but lean not bulky. That is the key to her method of waking up your accessory muscles as well as waking up and working your ab muscles after being stretched from your baby if that is the case.

I use to lift heavy weights in my 20's and I have hated my flabby arms for a decade because I hurt my upper back trying to lift so much weight that every doctor I saw told me I simply couldn't work my arms anymore. TAM only uses 3 pounds or less and my arms are so much thinner than they have EVER BEEN! NO pain!

I personally love that she doesn't talk a lot since you have to do the DVD 4-6 times a week to get the results you want. All you need to do it watch her and copy exactly what she is doing and follow the directions she does give you. She does give more verbal directions in the Post Pregnancy DVD. The leg workout is on the mat in the Post Pregnancy but using a chair in the MAT. I prefer the chair.

A few reviewers said they made fun of her with their friends because the method does seem like ""dancing"" or holding your arms out and sometimes pretending to slap someone. Even Tracy giggles in her DVDs that it may look or feel a little strange when you first begin her method. I agree, BUT I LAUGHED MY WAY TO A SIZE 2 (doubt those reviewers did)and I have been getting compliments at work from friends and family. So you decide, do you want results? It is a really fun workout and the music is great on the MAT. It's addicting!

I had been working out for 4 months at a very expensive studio in Beverly Hills prior to starting this dvd, and while I'm sure that the place is fantastic for some people it was doing nothing to change my body except to create bulk.  Enter my fortuitous vacation experiment with this dvd!!!  After a week I already saw changes in my arms, abs and I was starting to lose the bulk in my legs.  I will say that the music is horrendous, the cuing is almost non-existent, but I'm very uncoordinated and I got the hang of it within a couple workouts.  I am now doing this dvd (with my own playlist, seriously, that s#$% will put you to sleep) along with a couple of spin classes during the week for cardio and I honestly feel I have never been in better shape, nor has my wallet.  None of the moves are painful in any way to your knees or joints, it is not too difficult (even, I imagine, if you are a beginner.) and it really works!!!

I was really excited going in, but ended up very disappointed. Other than the leg portion of the workout (which left me sore the next day), I didn't like any of the components. The abs ""workout"" was literally laughable. She prefaced it by saying something along the lines of ""it takes practice"" and then proceeded to randomly jut her rib cage hither and thither without any instruction at all. I tried following along and ended up doubled over with laughter because I felt ridiculous. I also found the workout to be extremely boring - she rarely talks, and while overly-chatty trainers can annoy me on workout dvd's, it would be nice if she said something. She also made the most ridiculous ""sexy"" faces while she was doing her thing, so I was able to entertain myself by trying to mimic her. Oh, and don't even get me started on the music - just terrible all around. Needless to say I'm going back to my Jillian Michaels regimen for now!",1377129600,8,1116,4.52970297029703

Music is repetitive, and she is just bland, stale, and she come across as self-involved, not helpful.  And if you happen to be doing a stretch where you face away from the TV, she'll change the move/stretch without even saying anything, not so helpful for a workout DVD.

3561737,5,B001F2HZHI,"I was interested to try Tracy's workout because she is short like me, and for a long time I've been searching for a workout that doesn't bulk, or require me to use special gym equipment. Her workout has led to better tone all-around- I'm the most fit I have ever been at 42. I've been doing the mat 3-4 times a week for 8 months and it still is a challenge. Some people pooh-pooh her three pound weight advice, but try it for yourself before you judge. It isn't easy to keep them up and in motion for a sustained period of time.  For the legs, which became too easy, I've added 2 lb weights (body togs, which are weight ""sleeves"" and distribute the weight more evenly); they are great and I also bought on Amazon). As for her cardio dance routine, I am very, very uncoordinated and can't follow it at all, regardless of how much or little she cues. She could break each step down 50 times and I'd still do it incorrectly. So I run 3 times a week for 1/2 hour instead. Some say that her dieting advice is a little flaky, but if you want to lose weight while you are toning up, you have many options and can pick whatever diet works best for you. But there isn't a replacement for her mat and toning work. I have to think that many of her critics haven't actually tried or stuck with her mat workout for any length of time, or they would see results too. Or, they sell or teach other fitness methods and don't like competition.",1376870400,4,1425,4.21978021978022

If you do this workout the 5-6 days per week that Tracy Anderson recommends, you will quickly start seeing and feeling your body change. I've now order 2 additional videos (Perfect Design Series Level 1 and Precision Toning)and cannot wait to add them to the mix!

Pros:
- Easy to follow
- Workout is broken up into different segments (abs, arms, butt + thighs) so the workout goes by quickly and you can fast forward through segments you don't want to do
- The music is paced nicely so you can do each move to the beat of the song
- Inexpensive
- Start seeing/feeling results within first week
- She doesn't talk much, which is great if you do the video regularly and don't need constant cuing (although this might be frustrating for some people just starting out and don't know the flow of the workout)

Cons:
- There are a few mistakes in the video (e.g. does more reps on one side than the other), so I just do the opposite side first every other day to balance it out",1376092800,4,1019,4.3578947368421055
3561752,5,B001F2HZHI,"I really love this DVD, but it is difficult.  It's important to note that I am athletic and fit (just ran a half marathon, sailed through Jillian Michaels DVDs, work out 5-6 days/week) and I barely made it through this workout the first few times I did it.  I didn't imagine it would be so hard since you hardly even move; there is no cardio at all, and you remain in a stationary position almost the entire time.  The moves, however, are designed to completely exhaust your muscles. By the time I was done, my arms and legs were on fire all the way out to my fingers and toes.  It's very tricky to do the moves right and keep the pace with Tracy, but if you do it, you will get results.  I saw results in two weeks flat -- leaner arms, tighter thighs, thinner midsection.

The format of the workout is very odd too, but I LOVE it.  Tracy barely talks and rarely gives instruction, but I think that's great because you can really focus on the movements this way.  When she does speak, she doesn't encourage you, just comments on how badly your arms/legs/whatever should be burning.  I find this amusing.  She's a cruel little lady who gives no sympathy; she makes it clear that you have to work to earn your results.

If you're up for a challenge and want ""teeny tiny arms,"" as Tracy calls them, buy this DVD.  It's awesome and it works.",1376092800,8,1337,4.325301204819277

It would have been a great workout if I had been a client of Tracy Anderson and known what her workouts were like, but because I was new to her style, I was confused almost the whole time as to her timing and movement.  It is completely inconsistent and she doesn't count out her position timing so you find yourself bending and twisting to see if you are still in the right position only to find out 90% of the time, you are not.  She also doesn't tell you what moves and positions are coming up next until you are already supposed to be in them.  I was pretty disappointed because I really wanted to enjoy this dvd workout.

Love that she incorporates dance into the routine which makes it creative and fun.

I stepped on the scale before the workout and stepped back on after and I already lost 1 pound.

The leg series is good, but if you have any lower back issues, you might wanna be careful. I'm actually quite fit and strong, but the high reps in the arm sequence kinda kicked my ass.

However, after a while I realized that her cues come from the music. After just a few attempts I was moving along with the video perfectly. Also, the music on Tracy's video is actually cool, and makes you want to move to it. This is one major problem I had with other videos; the music was horrible/ boring.

I used to use Debbie Siebers work out DVDs but would find over time that these were giving me bulky muscles which is not what I wanted. I like how Tracy's workout gives long lean muscles.

After just a few weeks of using this video consistently, I am seeing results in my legs, butt, abs and my arms. I looked up a few of her dance cardio segments on YouTube and have been doing 10-20 minutes of those before the mat video. Doing this is an excellent warm-up, as others have mentioned.

I work out 3-6 days a week (depending on my schedule)  My regime includes a bit of light running, walking 4-12 miles a week, and anywhere between 4 and 12 hours of workouts which include cardio, weights, yoga....

The workouts I typically incorporate into my regular fitness schedule are:

Brazilian Butt lift
The Firm Abs, Butt and Thighs
Jillian Michaels Six Pack Abs and Killer Abs
Hip Hops Abs
Exhale: Core Fusion 30 Day Sculpt
Tracy Mallett Total New Body (Booty Bar)

I just purchased Tracy Anderson's Mat Workout and find it an excellent addition to my fitness regime.

The arms workout is fantastic - challenging and effective.  Tracy recommends not exceeding 3 lb weights, which are not challenging enough for me....I use 5 lbs weights.

The Abs/core workout is amazing and challenging.  I feel this workout with define and sculpt my midsection even further.

The Legs workout is very challenging.  My legs are very toned, but after having just one workout with this Mat Workout, I believe my legs will be more sculpted and defined.

3561808,3,B001F2HZHI,"I have been familiar with Tracy Anderson for a few years, but never wanted to commit to the $100+ DVD series.  I own 20+ workout DVDs (mostly from GAIAM) and know what I like/dislike in a workout DVD.

The Upside:
1) Works muscle groups that traditional mat workout DVDs do not.
2) Offers the user the option to only do portions of the DVD (i.e. upper body, lower body, etc.)
3) Works the entire body.
4) Good music.

The Downside:
1) Tracy doesn't keep to the rhythm of the music (she seems to be moving a bit faster), so I feel like I'm not ""keeping up"" with her.
2) Tracy transitions from one movement to the next very quickly and without any verbal cues (i.e. now reverse, move to the left side, etc.).
3) Doesn't give verbal cues when it's time to conclude a movement (i.e. if you're looking down, she doesn't tell you when it's time to look up, and you don't know because you're not looking at the TV).

Without having seen her other DVDs, I don't know whether this was made before she worked out the kinks of doing a workout DVD, or if this is just Tracy's style.  It's a great workout and I'm confident I will get the results I am looking for.  In terms of her presentation, I think she leaves something to be desired.",1373068800,2,1226,4.285714285714286

Tracy says throughout the video that this workout works different muscles than traditional forms of exercise, and you can definitely feel that after your first few workouts. I've been doing the mat method for about 5 weeks now, and see noticeable toning in my arms (in particular), and some new definition in my legs. Her stomach workout, while a little out there (don't feel bad if you look/feel like a complete idiot doing her 'standing abs' section), I also see some new definition in my stomach as well. The workout works a lot of different muscle groups, and if you stick with it you will see results...I've been really happy with the results, particularly the arms results.

Tracy doesn't give a ton of instruction throughout the video, but personally that does not bug me. So long as you are watching the tape fairly closely while you do the workout, you can easily follow along with her.",1372377600,4,1134,4.63681592039801
3561833,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have done Tracy's mat workout off and on for over a year, but have only recently begun to see results.  When I started using the video I knew it was working because I was very sore, but I didn't see visible results because I had 20 pounds of fat to lose.  Now that I have lost those 20 pounds by watching my diet and jogging a couple miles a few times a week I am seeing great definition that I have NEVER achieved before (even as a gymnast and dancer in high school).  I know that it is due to this video because it is the ONLY toning exercises that I am doing.  It is important to realize that you will not lose weight with this video alone.  You only burn about 220 calories in the hour long video.  You need to add cardio to this mat workout if you are trying to lose more than a few pounds.  I have lost over 20 pounds by counting calories with a free iPhone app, doing very slow jogging (about 2 miles 4 days a week), and doing this video 4-5 times a week.  When I don't have an hour to do the whole video I just do as much as I can.  My shoulders are becoming very defined and my calves and thighs look muscular but sleek.  I have lost a few inches around my waist as well.  This video is amazing and I love the way I feel after doing it!  Other reviewers are right, Tracy does different numbers of reps on different sides and sometimes even changes the order of moves from one side to the next.  I wish she had fixed these blunders before selling this video, but ultimately it does not affect my workout.  After the first few times though I developed my own way to compensate and make sure I am getting the same workout on both sides.  I like that she doesn't count reps or talk too much.  It is a bit challenging at first, but if you are going to be doing this video 4-6 times a week as she suggests, then you really want as little talking as possible.

3561860,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have just discovered Tracy Anderson's methods.  This mat workout is phenomenal for making everything tighten up and stop shaking like Jell-O.  It's a refreshing change of pace from the standard things of leg lifts and push ups and whatnot (even though those are just as necessary).  She makes it all burn and work all over.  This consists of a warm up, leg series (with a high backed chair), arms (with and without weights), gluts and abs.  The only bit of criticisms I give to this are for the standing abs series.  She goes a bit too quickly without much instruction and you find yourself struggling to keep up and do what she's telling you correctly.  Once you get the moves down pat (either in this or her webisodes), you WILL get that hourglass look about your abs front, back and side.  Some have also come down on her feeling that you should not use weights more than 3 lbs if you are a woman.  Honestly, 3 lb weights are all you need to tone up.  If you want strength, 3 lb weights will also do it but to challenge yourself you can use heavier.  What's nice about this is that you can achieve that tiny ballerina body with this BUT YOU MUST DEDICATE YOURSELF TO THE PROGRAM OR IT WON'T HAPPEN.  And you also must supplement this mat workout (like any other) with some kind of cardio (for me as of late, it's been spinning) in order to really burn the fat off.",1371081600,4,1369,4.346456692913386

However, it would be nice if she gave more instruction (like abs in, shoulders down) and did some counting or at least tell you when she was switching arms cause if you take your eyes off of the screen for two seconds she's changed the routine to something else without telling you.
Sometimes she does 8 reps on one arm and then 12 on the other, just inconsistent.

I am far from bulky (5'5"" 120lbs) and I found this dvd to be full of skinny girl nonsense.  This dvd will not provide any functional instruction on how to achieve a healthier body.  In my opinion none of what she preaches is practical for anyone living in the real world.  Tracy Anderson has no formal sports and fitness training.  She does not know about human anatomy.  I suggest that if you are thinking of purchasing this video you do some research into her methods first so you don't waste your money the way I did.  Here is an excellent article explaining why her method is nonsense by someone who actually knows.  I am in no way affiliated with this person, just found the article enlightening.

Tracy assumes while we are bent over reaching for our toes that we have eyes on the back of our head to see that she has moved on. She provides very little instructions such as when to move on to the next exercise. While you move into new position you have to pay close attention to the screen to keep up with her. A nice, ""left side, right side, etc..."" would be helpful. After reading other reviews I went into the purchase knowing what to expect. For 10 bucks I gave it a try anyway. It's a light workout that doesn't require a lot of equipment like heavy weights, step up boxes or bands, which is what I needed since I am just getting back into the exercise routine.

Tracy is a fantastic instructor but it seems that she is better in a one-on-one situation, as there are no prompts or descriptions of the movements throughout the workout that one would hear in a group activity.  Also, thanks to her facial expressions during this workout which varied between boredom and absolute boredom, I felt less than inspired while exercising.  Hopefully someone has told her since the taping of this workout that nonverbal communication is just as effective as verbal communication.

So to sum up, if you are familiar with Tracy's method, then I recommend this video.  If you are new, then I would recommend looking elsewhere.",1370390400,,821,5.135338345864661

If you're looking for a workout that has good directions from the instructor, this is not likely a good DVD for you.

Though I do like the moves themselves when you can figure out what do it, it's more annoying than what's it worth for me personally.

I also really like the hip exercises. I have an old SI joint tear and so it benefits me to strengthen the glutes, the IT band, etc. This is a hard to follow workout, as the cueing is minimal. You have to watch it several times before you really get the exercises. She often switches moves or sides and you don't even realize it. She is also a little odd, as far as an instructor.

That's three times the limit of what a woman should lift, right there!  What blatant stupidity.
Kudos to anyone who can make this workout work for them. Personally, I think it's drivel. And I think any young girls watching the interview with Tracy at the beginning could  have their self-images seriously damaged.",1366502400,5,852,4.458064516129032

3561949,5,B001F2HZHI,"I can really see my body changing after three months of doing it two to three times a week.  Tracy's theory about the 3pd weights makes sense and this weight doesn't bother my neck as heavier weights sometimes do.  My body feels strong and pretty aligned.  Besides this video I also do cardio two times a week. As Tracy said you really have to be rigorous about doing it consistently.

Some suggestions for Tracy for future videos (and forgive me if they were given already but I didn't read all of them only just a few):  1) Cueing, especially when one is looking at the floor, and when she changes the exercise, we have no idea.  2) Noticed that the number of repetitions sometimes is different for the left and right sides and wonder if there is a reason for that. Also, it might be nice to give us a quick warning like: ""two more repetitions"" or ""the last set.""  3) Segment the video so you can go back and do arms, or abs without having to hunt for it through the whole video.

Looking forward to a new video so I can have some variety. Thanks Tracy!",1365206400,3,1055,4.292929292929293

The arms I thought ""no way"" is this going to do anything.  Try it you'll be surprised to that the first few times (or more) you have a hard time keeping your arms up for a full 3 minutes.

It took me way to long to order a Tracy Anderson DVD due to complaints of how hard the exercises are, as well as, bad direction/cuing comments.  As far as my fitness, I am in pretty good shape, but need all over toning, so I thought I might as well give this a try, especially with such a cheap price.  I am glad I did!  Yes, the exercises are a bit difficult at first, but on this DVD the moves are easy to master after a couple of uses.  I have done the DVD around 8 times and I am now planning to do it every day for the next 30.  After that I am planning to order her Metamophisis DVDs, once I decide if I am Gluecentric or Hipcentric.  In the DVD Tracy mentions bring the skin back to the bone.  I thought that to be strange, but now I know what she means, I actually feel like my skin is tightening.  After doing the video 2 or 3 times, you will have no problem with the lack of cuing.  I watched the DVD before trying so that also helped.  I love the music and find Tracy enjoyable to watch.  She is really cute and not in an annoying way.",1363564800,3,1094,3.922727272727273

I don't see that available on Amazon but I have to assume that all of her stuff is generally the same.  My understanding of her method is that she is accessing accessory muscles to make you more toned.  I did not have that experience.  I am a healthy 35 year old with a long history of working out and consider myself to be reasonably fit.  Although I like her ab work a lot because it uses different leg positions, her arm series is lacking.  Even when I started to feel comfortable moving my arms around spastically, I didn't see any results.  I wouldn't believe the hype.  Sorry.",1363564800,,675,4.467213114754099

It allows me to change up my routine with more dancer like moves and I feel like a beast after getting through the arm section.  I don't think this DVD is a great item for an absolute beginner, but I don't think it is a waste of time or money either.  You don't have to buy into a person's complete philosophy to appreciate what they have to offer.",1363305600,,540,4.213592233009709
3562006,5,B001F2HZHI,"NOTE: I received a free review copy of this DVD from the distributor.

First, a little about me: I'm an avid exerciser in my mid-40s who generally works out daily and has done so for years now (since my late 20s). I exercise mainly at home with videos and enjoy a wide variety of activities, including kickboxing, kettlebells, circuits, yoga, Pilates, and stretching. I'm also very active in an online fitness community, so I have been aware of Tracy Anderson for years now, pretty much every since she surfaced as being Gwyneth Paltrow's trainer and began producing exercise videos. However, I'm not one to hop on bandwagons, and thus I never looked into purchasing either this DVD or the many other series which have followed it. Despite this, as time has passed, I have come to hear more and more about the Mat Workout, and it has sounded like something I might enjoy. In particular, I was interested in Anderson's upper body work, in which she combines both unweighted moves and use of light weights (I've found that this type of work combined with alternate days of heavy weight work really keeps my own arms in shape) as well as her targeted lower body exercises, which seemed like they could be especially helpful to me, as this is where I carry most of my weight.

The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following chapters: Mat Introduction - Mat Routine (which is NOT chaptered) - Gwyneth Interview, Mat - Tracy Main Interview. In her brief (1 minute) introduction to the the workout, Anderson suggests doing the Mat Workout 4-6 times per week; she recommends not doing anything else other than her Mat and Cardio Workouts. During the slightly longer interview (3 minutes), Anderson elaborates on the development of her Method, explaining that it grew out of 8 years of research experimenting with both herself (she stated that she had trouble losing weight/getting the body she wanted after trying dieting, Pilates, spinning, etc.) as well as other women of various body types. Paltrow's short interview is similar, supporting how Anderson's Method helped her to get into shape.

For the workout itself, Anderson is alone, instructing live in an attractive, mostly-wood studio with large glass windows in the background. Unlike with most barre-style workouts, which are usually performed barefoot, Anderson is wearing shoes here. Her cuing is often late or non-existent; you definitely have to keep your eye on her and sort of follow along (which, luckily, is relatively easy to do once you get the hang of what she is doing). Anderson describes the workout as ""strategic muscle exhaustion"" in which she is working to tire the larger muscles first in order to get at the smaller muscles. The music is great, mostly female vocal, flowing very well with the vibe of the workout. Although the workout is not chaptered (a clear oversight on the part of the producers!), there are definite divisions, so I have reviewed it by section below.

WARM-UP (5.5 minutes)
For this section, Anderson combines flowing movements with some yoga-like stretches. She begins with plies, moving into forward bends and then stretches including triangle, pyramid pose, and lunge. There's also a dancey feel with moves like hip sways/hip pops as well as full body side stretches and reaches. As noted above, you'll definitely need to be watching the TV since Anderson does NOT cue all of the moves.

STANDING LEGS (17 minutes)
For this segment, Anderson uses a chair for balance. The moves are performed at a steady, even pace, not frenetic like in some other barre-type videos. The exercises in the first series include the following: knee to shoulder, attitude lift to the side, attitude lift to the rear, knee forward and straight back, and straight leg pulse up; everything is then repeated on the second side. For the second series, Anderson starts with a leg lift to the side (point up/flex down) and then moves into attitude rotations, knee lifts side, and leg pushes rear; this series is also repeated on the second side. Anderson concludes the standing legs with some brief plies/hip stretches. One thing I noticed about this section: my standing leg became fatigued MUCH more quickly than my working leg!

STANDING ABS (3 minutes)
This dancey segment consists of rib isolation-type movements. Although Anderson offers almost no cuing here, she does seem to be following a pattern (e.g., single-single-double, forward and back, diagonal) that I think I will be able to pick up with a little practice. She also performs some circles, moves her legs from together to wide-legged, and ends with some hip sways. Overall, it's a chance to let loose for just a few minutes and have some fun dancing to good music!

STANDING ARMS (unweighted, 8 minutes)
For this section, Anderson is holding her arms at shoulder height and performing a variety of rotational arm moves that flow from the shoulders. These exercises are similar to what can be found in Classical Stretch (see Classical Stretch Arms & Abs/Legs & Butt and Essentrics Workout: Arms, Abs & Waist Toner/Legs, Butt & Thigh Thinner), and they are GREAT for shaping your arms/shoulders, improving your posture, and working out any pains or kinks in the upper body. Sometimes Anderson cues the upcoming move, offering tips such as ""imagine you are hitting someone off to the side,"" but other times, you just have to follow along.

STANDING ARMS (weighted, 8 minutes)
Anderson recommends not using weights heavier that 3 lbs. for this section; for my first time using the workout, I went with 2 lbs., and that worked well. Here the moves are different than in the previous segment, with many variations on presses, both overhead and to the sides. There are also some unique exercises, such as a lift from the waist to the armpits and a bowling-type move.

LEGWORK ON MAT (6.5 minutes)
Anderson starts this segment in a side-lying position for a knee-to-shoulder move. She then raises up to more of a seated pretzel-like position for knee forward and back, rear leg lifts, and leg scissors, and finally, she turns even further towards the floor (arms in push-up position) for single leg extensions. Lying face down, Anderson performs double bent leg lifts (frogs) to transition before repeating the entire floorwork series on the second side. I especially liked that this segment targeted the glutes so well WITHOUT including any all-fours work, which I hate.

FLOOR ABS (5.5 minutes)
This was my least-favorite section, mainly because of the position which Anderson uses. She sets up for crunches lying flat on the back with the legs wide, and from here, she performs a variety of small crunches up (e.g., crunch with leg lift, crunch with arm overhead, crunch with one foot crossed, etc.). It was the straight leg position that I did not like, as it made my back feel too arched (I suppose I can modify with bent knees). For the final move, Anderson places her hands under her glutes for double straight leg raises.

COOL-DOWN (4 minutes)
The cool-down was similar to the warm-up, containing many of the same stretches. Anderson does add in a few more rotational movements as well as more work for the abs here. The entire time for this workout is approximately 57.5 minutes.

Overall, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this workout! I really loved the legs work (both standing and floor) and the arms work, and I found the brief standing abs section to be kind of fun. The only segment that I really did not like was the floor abs, so I may modify or skip that section in the future. The day after doing the Mat Workout for the first time, I felt a pleasant amount of soreness in my upper and inner thighs, an area that generally NEVER feels sore on me.

I am certainly not a total proponent of Anderson's ""Method""--i.e., I don't agree that women should NEVER work out with more than 3 lbs. (although I do think that using light weights SOMETIMES makes sense, as with this workout), and I would not use Anderson's DVDs as my ONLY form of exercise, as I enjoy other things (yoga, Pilates, even heavier weights!) too much to give up. However, I am intrigued by the possibility that this workout might bring me some new and different results, and thus I plan to work it into my routine at least a few times per week over the next few weeks.

In the end, I would definitely recommend this fun and different workout!",1363046400,3,8358,4.823447313328681
3562007,3,B001F2HZHI,"I have worked out sporadically over the  years, but no structured exercise program in many years (I've done walking & exercise machines vs. Pilates, Yoga or the Tracy Anderson Method or Metamorphosis). I ordered this for a way to work on problem areas and tone full body. The workout is a good workout, but she doesn't give adequate instruction for a newbie to this workout. She is inconsistent with prompts and explanations of what she's doing or how to preform the movements. And the movements aren't always clear due to camera angles and visual obstructions.  After I've done the workout a few times, I'll hopefully figure that out and get the hang of it. Then I won't need the prompts and instruction I wish I had now, but the lack of these makes it more difficult to follow along during this initial learning phase.",1362873600,3,820,4.6875
3562008,5,B001F2HZHI,"I was hesitant to order this DVD but I've only done it twice since I just got it recently but I am pleased with how intense it is without hurting my joints. I am only 27 but my knees have started to hurt a little more with traditional workouts and I love the fluidity of this DVD. I don't think I can do this DVD 4-6 times a week right off the bat but 3 times a week seems reasonable and my arms have never been this sore before so I am looking forward the transformation. I'm a workout DVD junkie and usually get bored after a month or two of one workout so this has been refreshing for me. I love the low weight involvement in the DVD and the fact that I'm actually sweating and struggling to complete sets without feeling like my heart will explode!

I enjoy the music during the workout and the fact that she doesn't talk so much and just lets you flow with the movements. I'll be posting updates as I see results. I have 16 lbs to lose off a 5'0"" frame. I am also incorporating running 3 times a week and kickboxing DVDs (Turbo Jam) twice a week.",1362614400,,1051,4.0772946859903385

True there doesn't seem to be much of an ab workout- but overall I will have to work up to the leg and arm parts. If you are a beginner to workout tapes start wtih the post-pg, it also is very good for abs.",1362441600,,454,3.6907216494845363
3562065,5,B001F2HZHI,"I've been doing this DVD for about a month now, and I've been doing it it 3-4 times a week.  I've had to really concentrate and raise my level of fitness to be able to do it, but it's doable for me, and my form has improved as I worked through it.  When I first started, I couldn't believe the number of reps she did, or how bad the movements hurt, or how exhausted I was afterward.  I guess I'm just not used to fitness instructors asking this much of me, or maybe my accessory muscles were just very weak.  Either way, I've had to work up to it.

As other reviewers have mentioned, she doesn't talk much in this DVD, and it's completely fine for me.  Her near-silence doesn't bother me.  In fact, I've had to use so much of my concentration and determination to just continue with the reps that when she did distract me by saying something, I got really mad at her.  I would shout insults at the DVD player about shutting up and letting me do this in peace.  I used so many swear words that I wouldn't be surprised if the neighbors think I have some sort of exercise-induced Tourettes.  This workout is ultra challenging for me.  I'm always glad I did it, but I find I appreciate the way she doesn't try to mimic the bubbly style that some other fitness instructors have, and grin dementedly at me through the screen.  Where others find her manner unfriendly, I find it calm and professional.  Which is good for me, because her workout feels wildly sadistic, and I don't think I'd be able to do it if she was bouncing around like a cheerleader.

Even though I tell her I hate her several times throughout the workout, I'm fascinated with her theory about focusing on working the accessory muscles rather than the larger ones, and I'm impressed with how effective the exercises are.  I think her body looks absolutely perfect, as opposed to other trainers whose bodies appear overdeveloped to me, and I want to see if I can design a similar sort of physique by continuing to follow her method.  Right now I have a goal to save up and buy the first year of Metamorphosis, and I feel like doing a workout for a year should allow me to see whether or not I will like it for the long term, but I will probably do her Perfect Design Series while I'm saving up.  That should also help me know if I really want to invest in a year of Metamorphosis.

So.  This workout is completely different from any other workout I've done, and the instructor has a different manner than what we're used to seeing in our trainers, but I like that. It gives me a new goal to work towards, and I think I feel more hopeful than ever that I really can achieve a sleek, defined look and lose weight and get healthy.",1362355200,3,2689,4.31013916500994
3562066,5,B001F2HZHI,I can't even get through it without a few breaks and I haven't added any weights yet.  Looking forward to me awesome results!,1362355200,2,125,4.434782608695652
3562067,5,B001F2HZHI,"I am a fit 60+ woman, been doing yoga since the 60s (thank you Lillias, yoga and You, on PBS back in the day), I take my health seriously.  I've favored a lot of workout gurus over the decades, leaders like Cathy, Denise, Jane, Ellen Barret, others. And one of the best EVER was Callan Pinckney in the early 1980s.  [...]

Tracy's work reinvents Pinckney's work of Callanetics.  All the moves are powerful. She makes it look easy and beautiful.  One mat and a chair, and some tough sculpting of your body. I am thrilled that I have found it and am doing it.

I've always tried to take ballet workouts and training but they always get too ""dancy"" and I cannot follow well. This is dancer training without the frilly choreography. This is work out work that ballet dancers DO in order to do that frilly choreography.

I do the entire class some days.  More importantly, I take these moves to the kitchen and office or airport or wherever and just DO them. They target and reach muscle groups and the rest is just repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat. I do them everywhere I get a chance. I lay on my yoga mat and watch movies with the family while simply moving my legs, arms and core through these motions.

The arm section is intense.  The ribcage dance section is amazing for training to make your rib cage float and move freely in the body. It's also fun.

The cuing and the music are bad but it doesn't matter. Just learn her moves and do it.  I watch it now with my own music in the background, upbeat and motivating.  I use her video as a mirror image to learn and do and it makes me feel like a strong, fluid dancer. She is gorgeous and relaxed, playful, she doesn't give too much of a care if she misses a cue.  Just do it with her.

And the results are great.

Absolutely recommend this basic but quite difficult body sculpting/strength Method.",1362268800,11,1850,4.3654970760233915
3562068,4,B001F2HZHI,"I agree with most of the criticisms of this DVD.  Some sections are stronger than others-the unweighted arm section is great, but I would not recommend the weighted section to someone who does not work out regularly, as she just seems to be flinging her arms around without paying any attention to form, and unless you know what you're doing you could easily injure yourself.  Tracy doesn't really do any cueing-which is hard at the beginning but what's you've learned the moves it's nice not to have to listen to her. She also doesn't do equal amounts of reps, and it's annoying to have to keep track of that.  But overall, I like this DVD and she's got some good moves, it's just unfortunate she didn't spend a little more time putting the DVD together.",1362182400,,755,4.5777777777777775
3562069,4,B001F2HZHI,"This video is a great all-over workout that tones both the large and small muscle groups in your body without making your muscles bulky or large. This video is especially good for abs and arms. I have already seen results and I've only been doing this video for the last month and a half. FYI- you'll need a yoga mat, 3 lb hand weights, and a sturdy dining-room chair for this workout. I really like Tracy Anderson's method, which has a lot of unique moves I've never seen before that work both major and minor muscle groups to give you a toned look all over. Of course, these moves are hard, but you can adapt the workout for your level by just doing less repetitions of each exercise. Be aware though- this workout is not just strength training. I have found that it's quite the cardiovascular workout as well, which I wasn't expecting. I'm not an endurance runner or anything, but I do consider myself fairly fit (I speedwalk up and down the hills of San Francisco regularly and climb several flights of stairs with no problems), and I have to stop a few times during this workout to let my heart rate come back down a bit. This makes the workout take a pretty long time, since it's already an hour long even if you go straight through the whole thing without stopping. It usually takes me an hour and twenty minutes or so. If you wanted a 30-40 minute workout, you'd have to fast forward to the parts you want or stop it early, because there aren't any chapters within the workout. The first couple of times you do the workout you will probably also have to rewind frequently to clarify what exactly she is doing, because she doesn't verbally describe what she'd doing very much and changes moves suddenly, but you'll get the hang of it after doing the video a few times. The main complaint I have about this video is that the background music is horrible, repetitive New Age stuff that is really boring and would be better suited for studying than doing a high-intensity workout. The first few times I did the video I felt like it was the longest hour and a half of my life and could barely get through it. Then I got the idea to put the sound on mute and play my own high-energy music (dance pop and hip hop) instead. That completely changed my experience with this video. I highly recommend playing music with a fast, strong beat while you do this workout- the kind you can't resist dancing to. I use Pandora's Workout station and it works great. This helps me keep my energy up and makes the time go faster- not to mention it's way more fun! I feel like I'm out dancing at the club!",1362096000,2,2590,4.397916666666666

The moves themselves are basic, dance-based moves and very repetitive.  Her demeanor is also very strange: her expression is self-absorbed and awkward.  The result is one very boring DVD.  I felt like I needed to read a book while doing this, it was so tedious and low energy. Yikes...",1360972800,,446,4.8933333333333335

3562095,5,B001F2HZHI,"This is my first review on Amazon. I usually get my workout DVDs from Collage Video b/c I can watch segments, read about the instructor and how each DVD is broken down (20 min cardio, 20 min floor excercises, etc.)and search by the things that interest me at the moment (am I looking for dance, cardio, circuit training, pilates, yoga, etc.).  Sounds like I'm doing a plug for that website but I'm really just trying to get across that I research my videos like crazy before I buy. I've been using workout videos on the regular since Billy Blanks became big (at least to me) in the late 90's.  I am now a Prime member and since I don't pay for shipping, and the shipping is fast, I will order any video I can from here.

On to Tracy.  Many reviewers have complained of her lack of direction, not doing even reps on each side, and even the music.  Personally, I love that she's not talking throughout the video because who wants to hear the same thing 5 or 6 times/week?  I also switch which side I start with each time I do the video so that in the end, the reps even out.  My two previous loves were Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner but I had started to dread doing their videos.  I was sore in my quads all the time and would choose which video to do based on how many lunges and squats I could stand to do that particular day.  I actually look forward to going home and doing this video.  I definitely recommend doing it by yourself, with no one watching or walking in on you, at least 4 times.  It was after my fourth time that I started to get the hang of it.  It wasn't until after 10 times though that I didn't feel like a complete idiot doing her standing ab excercises.  I didn't measure myself so I don't know how many inches I've lost.  What I do know is my skin does feel tighter, like it's being pulled in tight across my muscles which makes me look much more defined.  The lines on each side of my stomach go all the way down my hips. My balance is better.  I can hold myself in positions that used to take effort without even realizing I'm doing it.  My husband says I look better than I did when we first met.  The burn I feel is much deeper than I think any excercise has gone - and it is not pain, it's an actual burn.  I like the difference.

About me - I am 34, active and I eat healthy but love, love wine almost every evening.  I have not given that up.  I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis just before my 25th birthday and that is the only year between now and 1998 that I have not been an avid excerciser.  I get an infusion for my RA every 8 weeks which keeps further joint damage from happening but I believe excercise is what keeps me strong and keeps me going and will hopefully help me never to develop any deformations that oftentimes accompany arthritis after a number of years.  I think this is a fantastic program for working the itty bitty muscles around my joints which I tended to ignore for the bigger ones.  Perhaps TMI but I know I'm not the only person who excercises with a chronic condition and am hoping this will be helpful for someone else who is perhaps similar looking for a change. Good luck!",1360627200,15,3148,4.215358931552587
3562096,3,B001F2HZHI,"I like this workout, but the music is awful. After I had done it once or twice I felt comfortable enough with the moves to turn the DVD volume down really low and put on my own music, which improved the experience of this workout tremendously. Tracy doesn't talk much, ( I don't think she elaborates enough, really, as to correct position of each move; and she doesn't count down the reps or anything) so you don't really need the sound. My favorite sections are the arms and abs - I wasn't familiar with the moves in these sections and both gave me sore muscles the next day ( which is rare at this point, I have a lot of workout DVDs)",1360540800,,636,4.221311475409836

I consider my fitness level to be intermediate and I have been trying countless classes and workout dvds to tone those stubborn sections and lose a few inches....after 3-4 weeks of doing this video 2-3 days per week (along with cardio on alternate days)  I quickly snuck right back into my size 4 jeans! I tried boot camps and jillian michaels but I only seemed to bulk instead of trim - I know most people swear by Jillian and hard core circuit training but my body type (short and curvy) just did not mix well with those sessions and I started to build bulk in my legs and arms instead of tone. After seeing the results of just a few weeks of Tracy I finally had my 'AHA' moment and figured out what worked for my body. I am unsure why people are picking apart little things she does in the video - I barely notice it because I am too busy working for the results and focusing on those killer leg lifts and arm exercises. The music in the background is awesome and unique and this is the ONLY workout video that I seem to not get sick of and don't mind doing again and again. The fact that she does not talk much helps you stay in the zone and not get bored. I actually LIKE the fact you cannot switch to different segments because it trains you to complete the whole dvd- which is what YOU NEED TO DO to get results. People need to stop complaining about not being able pick one segment at a time to complete - that is NOT going to get you the results Tracy is trying to help you with. There are some days where I groan about it being a ""Tracy day"" because it DOES make you work for it, but I am completely happy with this purchase and will turn to it again and again!",1360454400,9,1692,4.142857142857143

For some reason she felt it was necessary to put music with lyrics in the background of her exercise tape.  The music says ""I am the Christ"" and it is not talking about Jesus Christ.  It is disturbing and repulsive for someone like myself who treasures the name of Jesus Christ.  I considered working out and turning the music down on just that song, (It is the first song on the tape).  And then I thought, Why would a keep a tape in my house that insults my faith.  I threw it in the trash. It seems that everywhere we turn Jesus name is used in vain and derision.

3562104,3,B001F2HZHI,"This was a weird video.  Although the arm and leg segments (done primarily with your own body weight) are good toning exercises, I felt as if Tracy wasn't ""all there"" for the video.  She kind of threw in her own movements here and there as if she were dancing with herself, and had her hair down and in her face most of the time.  More of an exotic chair dancer vibe as opposed to the more aggressive Jillian videos I am used to. Plus she also says you should NEVER lift more than 3 pound weights or you will bulk up.  Having worked out with a trainer for years lifting heavier weights I am not ""bulky."" I will probably use this video for those days when I want to workout but not be a big sweatball.",1359763200,,700,4.125
3562115,4,B001F2HZHI,"I'm used to lifting at the gym and tried this out for a change of pace.  I can definitely feel it working in my butt and arms, so if you have the time to spend an hour on toning, it's a good workout to mix in.  However...Tracy's not big on cues, so you have to watch her constantly to keep up with what she's doing and change moves when she wants to change.  It's a little annoying in the arm part because she changes so frequently and there's no regular pattern, but with legs it's not a big deal since she sticks with one move for a while and cues better when she changes.  The abs part on the floor is bad about this too; it's hard to crane your neck around to watch her and keep good form with your abs moves.

I haven't done this long enough to comment on results, but I like it for something different if you're tired of the usual gym workout for toning.  I don't think you'll gain strength from doing this, but it could lean you out if you keep your diet in check.",1359504000,,971,4.03125

She does not verbalize all her movements but she does ask you to follow along. Her teaching method reminded me of dance/ballet classes where the instructor expects you to follow, mess up a few times, and then eventually get it with repeated practice.  Her mat workout requires a mat, up to 3lb weights, and an ordinary chair.  Great home workout dvd!",1359504000,,490,4.662790697674419

Now onto Tracy. No, she doesn't give instructions every single second of the video which to me is refreshing. Do it twice and you'll know what's coming next without her barking at you. She makes funny faces but I think it's endearing because I think she just laughs at herself when she's standing there talking to a camera. Yeah, she bites her lip once in a while but the girl is smoking hot! So leave her alone :)

I really like that she doesn't talk much (I think it's the biggest advantage over other DVDs) and I love the music so much. It's simple, clean, and effective workout. Just to give you an idea, I tried a lot of different workouts and I find this one to be the least annoying. I bought Turbo Jam and I hated it so much, Chalene was so irritating with all her screaming, ""jerky"" movements, and fake non-stop smiling. I sold it right away. The P90X - the guy just talks SO MUCH, I couldn't stand it after a while. I also have Insanity and I really like it but it's a lot more intense. Tracy is very quiet and she just does her thing. I don't know why people complain so much about lack of instructions, I found it to be just right amount and I could follow her without watching the DVD first like some other suggested. There is no annoying cheering and jumping, just a very focused and exhausting workout. It's very different from anything I've tried and it's for sure my favorite. Other reviews also mentioned her hair and that the way she moves is too sexy. I think you are just jealous.

Pretty much you have to keep all eyes on her because she adds her own flair and doesn't tell you when she adds a movement in the mix. You'll be doing one arm movement then she mixes up the beat/reps. Most workout DVDs coach you along the way with reps, she's pretty much silent the entire. I liked that she didn't stop to teach you a move then go on, but I also didn't like that fact.  This workout isn't too challenging or too complex.  I think she could have condensed this down to half an hour workout, not 53 minutes.

If this is what Madonna does on stage, I know where she gets it from.

I found myself having to stretch frequently during the arm movements, and using 2 lb weights in the weighted segment.

3562141,3,B001F2HZHI,"Purchased the mat and the dance from Costco at a cheaper price than offered here which I am glad because she is not a good instructor.  I was a fitness instructor for 20 years and workout constantly at my club and at home with various DVD's.  I do try different things constantly.  Pure Barre, zumba, bellydance, step, spin etc.  I consider myself very fit for 56.

Her mat workout does offer some decent leg and ab routines, but you have to watch constantly since she changes moves without cueing.  Drives me crazy and I can tell what she is doing from my previous training but I feel like I am watching ""the tracy show"".

Her background is mostly dance but if you are new do not try this until you have at least gone to a ballet, barre, yoga or dance class with a qualified instructor.

I put her dance DVD in and I did not go over the beginning routines where I guess she shows you the moves so my only comment was it was boring after 10 minutes of watching her move and dance around rather than instructing me.  But as I said maybe it is better if you go over the beginning.  One review I read stated that you can either follow her or just move to your own rhythm and my comment on that is ""why buy it then if you do your own thing.""

She does this standing ab series that is near impossible to follow. The arm series was good, but, NO stretching or break in between that series and the next which uses the same muscles. The lying down leg series, you have to be a contortionist to follow. Seems to me that this whole DVD was for Tracy to admire Tracy.

3562144,5,B001F2HZHI,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the distributor.

First, a little about me:  I'm an avid exerciser in my mid-40s who generally works out daily and has done so for years now (since my late 20s).  I exercise mainly at home with videos and enjoy a wide variety of activities, including kickboxing, kettlebells, circuits, yoga, Pilates, and stretching.  I'm also very active in an online fitness community, so I have been aware of Tracy Anderson for years now, pretty much every since she surfaced as being Gwyneth Paltrow's trainer and began producing exercise videos.  However, I'm not one to hop on bandwagons, and thus I never looked into purchasing either this DVD or the many other series which have followed it.  Despite this, as time has passed, I have come to hear more and more about the Mat Workout, and it has sounded like something I might enjoy.  In particular, I was interested in Anderson's upper body work, in which she combines both unweighted moves and use of light weights (I've found that this type of work combined with alternate days of heavy weight work really keeps my own arms in shape) as well as her targeted lower body exercises, which seemed like they could be especially helpful to me, as this is where I carry most of my weight.

The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following chapters:  Mat Introduction - Mat Routine (which is NOT chaptered) - Gwyneth Interview, Mat - Tracy Main Interview.  In her brief (1 minute) introduction to the the workout, Anderson suggests doing the Mat Workout 4-6 times per week; she recommends not doing anything else other than her Mat and Cardio Workouts.  During the slightly longer interview (3 minutes), Anderson elaborates on the development of her Method, explaining that it grew out of 8 years of research experimenting with both herself (she stated that she had trouble losing weight/getting the body she wanted after trying dieting, Pilates, spinning, etc.) as well as other women of various body types.  Paltrow's short interview is similar, supporting how Anderson's Method helped her to get into shape.

For the workout itself, Anderson is alone, instructing live in an attractive, mostly-wood studio with large glass windows in the background.  Unlike with most barre-style workouts, which are usually performed barefoot, Anderson is wearing shoes here.  Her cuing is often late or non-existent; you definitely have to keep your eye on her and sort of follow along (which, luckily, is relatively easy to do once you get the hang of what she is doing).  Anderson describes the workout as ""strategic muscle exhaustion"" in which she is working to tire the larger muscles first in order to get at the smaller muscles.  The music is great, mostly female vocal, flowing very well with the vibe of the workout.  Although the workout is not chaptered (a clear oversight on the part of the producers!), there are definite divisions, so I have reviewed it by section below.

WARM-UP (5.5 minutes)
For this section, Anderson combines flowing movements with some yoga-like stretches.  She begins with plies, moving into forward bends and then stretches including triangle, pyramid pose, and lunge.  There's also a dancey feel with moves like hip sways/hip pops as well as full body side stretches and reaches.  As noted above, you'll definitely need to be watching the TV since Anderson does NOT cue all of the moves.

STANDING LEGS (17 minutes)
For this segment, Anderson uses a chair for balance.  The moves are performed at a steady, even pace, not frenetic like in some other barre-type videos.  The exercises in the first series include the following:  knee to shoulder, attitude lift to the side, attitude lift to the rear, knee forward and straight back, and straight leg pulse up; everything is then repeated on the second side.  For the second series, Anderson starts with a leg lift to the side (point up/flex down) and then moves into attitude rotations, knee lifts side, and leg pushes rear; this series is also repeated on the second side.  Anderson concludes the standing legs with some brief plies/hip stretches.  One thing I noticed about this section:  my standing leg became fatigued MUCH more quickly than my working leg!

STANDING ABS (3 minutes)
This dancey segment consists of rib isolation-type movements.  Although Anderson offers almost no cuing here, she does seem to be following a pattern (e.g., single-single-double, forward and back, diagonal) that I think I will be able to pick up with a little practice.  She also performs some circles, moves her legs from together to wide-legged, and ends with some hip sways.  Overall, it's a chance to let loose for just a few minutes and have some fun dancing to good music!

STANDING ARMS (unweighted, 8 minutes)
For this section, Anderson is holding her arms at shoulder height and performing a variety of rotational arm moves that flow from the shoulders.  These exercises are similar to what can be found in Classical Stretch (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classical-Stretch-Arms-Abs-Legs-Butt/dp/B0011FTIJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classical Stretch Arms & Abs/Legs & Butt</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essentrics-Workout-Arms-Abs-Waist-Toner-Legs-Butt-Thigh-Thinner/dp/B001QX6KTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essentrics Workout: Arms, Abs & Waist Toner/Legs, Butt & Thigh Thinner</a>), and they are GREAT for shaping your arms/shoulders, improving your posture, and working out any pains or kinks in the upper body.  Sometimes Anderson cues the upcoming move, offering tips such as ""imagine you are hitting someone off to the side,"" but other times, you just have to follow along.

STANDING ARMS (weighted, 8 minutes)
Anderson recommends not using weights heavier that 3 lbs. for this section; for my first time using the workout, I went with 2 lbs., and that worked well.  Here the moves are different than in the previous segment, with many variations on presses, both overhead and to the sides.  There are also some unique exercises, such as a lift from the waist to the armpits and a bowling-type move.

LEGWORK ON MAT (6.5 minutes)
Anderson starts this segment in a side-lying position for a knee-to-shoulder move.  She then raises up to more of a seated pretzel-like position for knee forward and back, rear leg lifts, and leg scissors, and finally, she turns even further towards the floor (arms in push-up position) for single leg extensions.  Lying face down, Anderson performs double bent leg lifts (frogs) to transition before repeating the entire floorwork series on the second side.  I especially liked that this segment targeted the glutes so well WITHOUT including any all-fours work, which I hate.

FLOOR ABS (5.5 minutes)
This was my least-favorite section, mainly because of the position which Anderson uses.  She sets up for crunches lying flat on the back with the legs wide, and from here, she performs a variety of small crunches up (e.g., crunch with leg lift, crunch with arm overhead, crunch with one foot crossed, etc.).  It was the straight leg position that I did not like, as it made my back feel too arched (I suppose I can modify with bent knees).  For the final move, Anderson places her hands under her glutes for double straight leg raises.

COOL-DOWN (4 minutes)
The cool-down was similar to the warm-up, containing many of the same stretches.  Anderson does add in a few more rotational movements as well as more work for the abs here.  The entire time for this workout is approximately 57.5 minutes.

Overall, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this workout!  I really loved the legs work (both standing and floor) and the arms work, and I found the brief standing abs section to be kind of fun.  The only segment that I really did not like was the floor abs, so I may modify or skip that section in the future.  The day after doing the Mat Workout for the first time, I felt a pleasant amount of soreness in my upper and inner thighs, an area that generally NEVER feels sore on me.

I am certainly not a total proponent of Anderson's ""Method""--i.e., I don't agree that women should NEVER work out with more than 3 lbs. (although I do think that using light weights SOMETIMES makes sense, as with this workout), and I would not use Anderson's DVDs as my ONLY form of exercise, as I enjoy other things (yoga, Pilates, even heavier weights!) too much to give up.  However, I am intrigued by the possibility that this workout might bring me some new and different results, and thus I plan to work it into my routine at least a few times per week over the next few weeks.

I will update my review with any additional information about my own experience, but in the meantime, I would definitely recommend this fun and different workout!",1357948800,7,8839,5.055862068965517
3562155,3,B001F2HZHI,"This is a very good workout for lower body and arms.  The first half of the DVD is solid with the led and arm series but the standing ABS and floor work is a waste of time.  I do beachbody programs 6 days a week but bought this to supplement.  She is also completly WRONG when she talks about NEVER lifting more that 3lbs or you will ""bulk"". Please. That is the just plain incorrect information for a fitness ""expert"" to be giving to clients.  It is also much longer than it needs to be so if you only do the staning leg and arms series you will get a good workout in a reasonable time.",1357776000,,586,4.025862068965517
3562156,2,B001F2HZHI,"I got this looking to change up my routine a little bit, but this style is really not for me.  I really do enjoy weight bearing and intense workouts, and I think a little ""bulk"" is beautiful on a woman, so this review is probably a little biased.  I read other reviews saying this workout was hard, but I did not find that to be the case (however I also did not add ankle weights).  My hips were SLIGHTLY sore after the first day, but no more after that.  It was hard for me to make it through the DVD.. not because of difficuly, but because I found it ""ZzzzZZZ""- boring.  There is very little instruction, but that didn't bother me......  I guess I just like the endorphine rush after a super intense workout which this workout did not provide.. nor did it provide a relaxing/energizing feeling like I normally get after a yoga workout.

What I really did NOT like about this dvd - it really just seemed to be about ""looking good"" rather than feeling good.  I found her ""funny"" to watch... and some of the things she says just rubbed me the wrong way (specifically about bulk - I'm not an expert, but I thought weight bearing / resistance was a good way to build bone density and prevent osteoporosis in women over 40?).  I don't know..I don't ""bulk up"" easily and commonly use 15-30 lb weights, so maybe if you do have a tendcy to ""bulk"" you would feel differently.

I wouldn't give this one star specifically because I haven't used it long enough to see if it works.. and it has worked for many others.. but if you like intense workouts and feeling strong.. I would check out some of her sample workouts on youtube before purchasing this DVD.",1357689600,5,1645,4.381578947368421
3562157,4,B001F2HZHI,"I purchased this workout along with the dance cardio as a way of ""sampling"" the Method, to see if it was a program I'd commit to (at $10/ea, a bargain). At 5'2"" and looking to shed @ 10-15 lbs and tone up, I was tired of working hard with other programs and getting very muscular vs toned. That is not to bash other programs-they no doubt were effective in getting me fit, just not the physique I was looking to achieve. As someone who has dogged determination once I commit to something, I started the program doing both Mat and cardio 5-6x/week. Within 2 weeks, with no modifications in my diet (generally a healthy eater-3 meals with a a few healthy snacks in between), I dropped 5 lbs and noticed some overall body toning. My clothes  began to fit better. At 1 month, I dropped a few more pounds and pulled out some ""skinny jeans"" in storage. At this rate, I'll soon hit my goal soon and am very happy with the way my body is responding the this method of exercise. As previous reviews have mentioned, there is a lack of instruction and some of the moves looked downright ridiculous initially (I cracked up the first few times I tried them, thinking ""you've got to be kidding me""). But the proof is in the results, and the program is definitely working for me. I just purchased Metamorphosis to take my progress to the next level.",1357516800,4,1334,4.4227642276422765
3562158,3,B001F2HZHI,"I gave this a three for the simple fact that if you can actually follow the instructor and stay on beat you will get sore muscles. My issue with this video is that there is virtually NO INSTRUCTION. the instructor changes routines and positions without any notice and encorporates her legs and hips in the arm workout but gives no notice or instruction on what she is doing, what foot should be forward, what hip to lean on. There is no audible counting, though at one point in time during the leg workout with the chair she says...""4 more to go"" but continues on after 4 more to like 10 more. The upper ab section was really just watching Tracey trying to look sexy while doing a hip jut/sway type of action....however if you are not a dancer, which i am not, you end up looking ridiculous in trying to follow her, not to mention my abs feel nothing so clearly i am doing it wrong...however there is not instruction coming on how to do it at all much less how to do it right. I do private and group pilates and I am used to instructors vocalizing all positions and routines and keeping a constant dialogue, reminders to breath, reminders about keeping form etc. NADA here. I had really high hopes for this video but sadly I feel like this would get more use by the guys in my family for basic viewing entertainment than an actual workout. I will be switching back to my pilates DVD.",1357430400,9,1383,4.364341085271318

I was expecting to be sore the next day as the DVD promised and I was not.  The music is horrible. the moves are really sexual and weird.  I don't agree with some of her methods, for instance she talks against having any type of muscular tone and instead promotes just being skinny.  What is the point of having a flat stomach without muscle tone?  Having muscles, does not equate to looking like a man.  Just look at Jillian Michaels, Michelle Dozois, and Amy Bento just to name a few.  By the way, any of these women have great workouts that burn fat, strengthen, and tone.  You need the balance.",1357344000,3,778,4.429577464788732

3562161,4,B001F2HZHI,"I've been doing Jennifer Galardi's Ballet Body and Jennee's ballet fitness dvd's for 6 months.  I love the results but I've been looking for something new along the same lines for a while.  I stumbled across this one on Amazon and decided to take a chance.  None of the reviews really explained the workout and now I see why...it's hard to describe.  It starts with a few plie's to warm up, then the chair section includes some attitudes and some moves simalir to Jenne's kick section (but less intense) and that's about all of the ballet in this workout.  The ab work is unique; not a bunch of boring crunches.  The standing ab work is a lot of fun and more similar to dancing in a club than working out.  Warning: you will look like a spaz doing this but feel awesome after so warm up your jazz hands.  The arm work is killer...it will literally kill your arms.  I tried Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful (don't wate your money, most irrateing instructor ever) and she did a ballet arms series similar to Anderson's arm work but Anderson's is easier to follow and much more effective.  It's exhausting but push through becasue there is a method to her madness.  About halfway through I started to feel my neck and shoulders getting really tight but she finished the series with some lower movements that worked the kinks out.  There is very little instruction but if you have done a ballet/dance based workout before you will recognize the moves and have no problem following along.  The camera angles are also better in this DVD than most and you will be able to see what she is doing clearly.  The only time I had a problem is with one section of the floor leg work...but that came after the arm work so I was a little distracted by how much my arms hurt.  I also really liked being able to work out without the incessant chattering.  I hate when instructors are overly incouraging...they can't see you. I was able to do the whole workout the first time through without any breaks.  It's not extremely challenging but it is effective.  It's nice to be able to just put a DVD in and work out instead of having to work up to being able to do the whole thing.  The most interesting, and hardest to explain, part of this workout is that she never stands still.  She is constantly moving.  I've tried several of the exhale series and I love the workouts but they are so stationary I get bored.  The exhale chair work will give you amazing results but they are so repetitive.  Anderson's chair work is similar but she puts her own spin on it and constantly moves her hands (almost absentmindedly) to the music.  It seems small and insignificant but strangely it kept me distracted from the burning in my legs and allowed me to finish the whole series.  The music is not like typical workout music and the series are timed to the songs so you can tell when a series is almost over.  I also like that there are no ads at the beginning, just put the DVD in, hit play, and work out.  I really like this workout and I am going to try her cardio DVD next.",1357171200,3,3049,4.4078711985688726
3562162,4,B001F2HZHI,"I'm in pretty good shape and workout a few times a week. I heard about Tracy Anderson workouts helping people who bulk easily to lean out.
(1) Not for those looking to build muscle: i don't get why there's reviews hear saying ""I'm not afraid of bulk"". Well, building a lean body is what this DVD is about. If you want bulk, fine - but this isn't for you.
(2) Yes, Tracy Anderson is kinda annoying - don't let that stop you! This DVD is neither motivational nor edited cleanly. She says very little and makes kissy faces at the camera. I'm looking to workout though, I don't need to like the person.
(3) You must vary your workouts. I gave one star off b/c I kinda lost my booty doing just Tracy Anderson workouts. You NEED to build muscle as you get older, no if and or buts. And, you need to do squats. This DVD will however make you look tinier if you incorporate it into your rotations.
(4) Results: here it is - I've been a runner most of my life and hated my ""bulky legs"". I always, always felt bulky in my arms, calves, thighs, etc. This WILL change your body and quickly. I love my legs now and even though I do more HITT work, I still pull out this DVD from time to time. It's not the hardest workout I've ever done and is a little boring. You just gotta suck up the boredem though and do it.
(5) I paid alot more for this 4 years ago. I mean, $7 bucks?! It's a steal! Get it b/c this will be one you'll go to alot if you're the type of person who bulks easily.",1357171200,3,1469,4.051546391752577

3562164,5,B001F2HZHI,"This is my very first review ever of any product that I have purchased online. Although many of the reviews on here of Tracy's products seem professionally produced, let me assure you that I am certainly just an average 40 something female wanting to share info on a great product. I initially purchased Tracy's 30-Day Method book in June and wanted to follow the program for the entire month. I was so excited to get started with her unique approach, that I read the book in 2 days then began measuring my arms, hips, butt and thighs as she suggests. I also purchased her post-pregnancy dvd as a supplement to the one that came with the book. By the middle of July, following the meal plan in her book and alternating the dvd's, I dropped 3 dress sizes from a solid size 12 to a size 6! I am also 5 ft nothing like Tracy, so this form of workout has been very effective for me. I can honestly say that I have achieved results I have never seen before from my gym workouts or any workout for that matter. Although none of the moves that Tracy does are simple, they are doable, just do what you can and you will still see incredible results and quickly. I purchased the Mat dvd  after reading the reviews and I'm glad I did. It is so tough, but challenging enough to want to do the moves better with each passing session. If you are looking to really change the way you look, and want an irresistibly attractive figure, Tracy Anderson's Method wins hands down. Since the body transformation I've been able to achieve I have gotten a plethora of compliments, have been approached by more men than I have had in years, and my sense of beauty and esteem is through the roof. I would give this product rating more stars if they were available. Look into Tracy's products they are worth it for sure. I really hope this helps to make an informed decision to purchase.

3562175,3,B001F2HZHI,"I got this video last week from Amazon (got within 15 hours of ordering; love Amazon!!).

I've been working out since the age of 15 (over 18 years) and have done numerous workouts over the years. My main form of working out is doing eliptical machine and/or treadmill for 45-60 minutes or bootcamp/kickboxing class, then I do weight machines. On the days I don't go to the gym I do either Tae-Bo, P90X, Jillian Michaels, or Jackie Warner DVDs, running, or workout in my home gym (Step up, Bosu Ball, 4 sets of free weights). I also used to go to Billy Blanks Tae Bo classes at his studio ( when it used to be in S.O.); so I consider myself to be in good shape.

The good things about this video are the arm and leg workouts and the last abdominal workout. I'm so used to doing my weight routine that these exercises are different than what I usually do and are good workouts to add to my current workout routine.

The things I didn't like about this DVD is the 1st abdominal routine; but then again I like the 6 pack look. This part was confusing as she never cues at all; during this part of DVD I just did my own thing as I couldn't follow along. The biggest problem though is her not cueing at all; luckily the leg and final abdominal workout were easy to follow without the cuing, but certain parts during the arm routine got confusing.

I got this DVD as an addition to my current workout routine (I don't do this by itself), so for the price the DVD isn't that bad. I just wanted something different. This isn't a bad workout, just not great. Rated this a 3 for the leg, arm, final abdominal routine and Tracy's calm demeanor.",1356048000,,1632,4.288961038961039
3562176,3,B001F2HZHI,"Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of Tracy nor am I a fan of Gwyneth. They both rub me the wrong way for some reason. However, when I found this in the local library I decided to try it.

A little background about me: I have been doing weight bearing workouts for 2 decades now.  Mostly THE FIRM (the original 5 are still my favorite). I do these workouts with weights about 5-6 times a week so I consider myself to be in pretty good shape.  I tried this DVD because I happened to have caught a part of Tracy's infomercial and tried my own variation of the glute work. She did it standing up behind a chair, I did it as donkey kicks with weights. The only difference between this and the donkey kicks I do everyday was the angle (knees slightly out instead towards the floor) an instead of leading with the toe up, I relaxed the lower leg and pushed concentrating on the knee (try it, you'll see what I mean).  After doing this a few times, I noticed my bum was rounder, higher and fuller. LOVED IT.

Okay, so I tried this dvd and yes, Tracy doesn't que well and just does random moves in high repetitions.  I don't quite mind this since I kinda don't like her voice... sorry, but true.  She does some funny, jerky movements with her upper body while you do the lower body moves standing behind a chair. I did this without weights but I definitely felt a burn.  She also does a series of arm movements without weights that is tough but I was able to finish it with a lot of burning. The ab work was a bit weak in my opinion.

Bottom line: 50 minutes went fast and it is a pretty good workout to add to your repertoire of other stronger cardio and weight bearing workout but I wouldn't use this as stand alone exercise program.  I also think that after a few uses, I will probably get tired of this dvd. However, better than I thought.",1355875200,,1843,4.166197183098592

This is a really fantastic workout. What I like most is that it is challenging my body in a brand new way and getting me outside of my comfort zone. The moves are a lot of fun and are not mindless; these exercises require lots of attention and focus which I enjoy very much. I also follow Zuzana Light and so these two women do not get anymore opposite. I wanted to incorporate Tracy's workouts to get more definition.

I like the pace, the music is nice, and the set is like working out in Tracy's studio or home. The lighting is nice and it is an overall relaxing and fun DVD.

My only issue is with the ab section. During certain parts she does not tell you when she is raising her legs or switching something. I found that annoying at first, but then I just went with it. During the standing abs, I do my best to follow along with her, but I think she really wants you to feel the music and use her as a guide, rather than a strict follower. You can tell she is going with the music so I follow that concept.

This has to be the worst workout video I've ever purchased. Practically NO instruction about the moves, form, etc! It seems that Tracy is more concerned with playing vixen for the camera. I have a lot of purchased dvds over the years -- some I really liked and others not so much -- but I always kept them. I was so shocked and insulted at how bad this video is that I actually returned it!",1350864000,9,669,4.309523809523809
3562204,5,B001F2HZHI,"I am 44 years old; not fat but not in shape or tune.  So I decided to purchase this Mat workout solely on the reviews.  I must say I really enjoy this workout.  It's hard the first time & a bit longer than I would like, but like Tracy says you have to put the time in on yourself.  I had to switch the 3lb weighs for 2lb weights for the arms and slowly work into the 3lb.  But only after 4 times working out; I feel the difference!!  I do this every other day...Tracy does encourage you to do this workout 5-6 per week, but I find it a bit much for me.  I MAY want to increase once all the moves become very easy for me but the first 2-3 months every other day will do!!  She does not instruct much but after about your 4th time doing it; you'll become much better at it.  Hope this helps and now I'm off to put Tracy on; this is my workout day & i'm worth it!!",1349654400,5,861,3.8192090395480225
3562215,3,B001F2HZHI,"Agreed, that all who have bought this video see the excellent benefits as well as the video""s instructional shortcomings.  Truly, not enough verbal instruction. I know it sounds funny, but having done Jillian Michael's ""ripped in 30"" videos where she's yelling at you and finally you press ""mute"" since you don't want to listen to her anymore...this is the opposite extreme!  Tracy doesn't say enough...enough verbal instruction so you know if you're doing it right, which foot, when to switch to the next position, etc...There are LONG stretches of silence during the video, which, if you've done the video many, many times...this might be a good thing, but in the beginning portion of learning the video and the series of exercises... it's NOT great. If your head is down during a particular stretch and she switches positions, you have no clue because she hasn't said a word, unless you strain your neck up to pay attention.  Yep, you missed the next transition. Even if she counted up to a certain number when doing repetitions you'd atleast be able to do the exercise knowing how many to expect.

Great arm work out as all have stated, a real burning, toning, re-defining portion of the video.  But...I could have ""you-tubed"" that portion of the video.  Obviously one-on-one training is her strength, but verbal instruction is not.",1348963200,,1336,4.941964285714286
3562216,3,B001F2HZHI,"First of all, the picture on the cover of the dvd looks nothing like her- does she realize that?
Now onto the review.

This workout is simply not for me.
I'm 36 years old, have been working since since I was about 15 and am not afraid of ""bulking up"". Having said that, using weights over 3 lbs will not give me Popeye muscles. In fact, I use much heavier weights than that but have never looked like a fitness competitor or the like. Perhaps it's just the way my  body responds to weight training.

It seems Tracy has a very specific body type (Mesomorph perhaps?) that responds to weights very quickly and it's obvious she want's ""teeny tiny arms"" as opposed to the lean, toned arms and body I am after. I don't want teeny arms nor am I afraid of the ""six pack abs"" she frowns against.

Now, I did her workout once. I am not interested in doing it again because a) I didn't break a sweat. b) I am not sore in the slightest. c) I don't want a dancer's body and I can't imagine having to go through that god-awful video of her pouting her lips once again.

Tracy has no sense of instruction and it amazes me that no one warned her before she published this workout dvd. She switches moves every few seconds without warning and half that time it feels like she is in a music video rather than a fitness studio.

I'm sure this approach works for some women but I am not one of them. I also prefer an instructor who gives cues, counts and warns their audience before going on to the next move. Not to mention that FORM is number #1 when it comes to working out and Tracy doesn't mention it once!

Having said all of that, I am glad this has helped a lot of people, even if one of them isn't going to be me!",1347753600,4,1703,4.142424242424243
3562217,3,B001F2HZHI,"I completely support this method of fitness...  Working smaller muscle groups to support joints and prevent injuries.  However, Tracy leads the DVD with very limited instruction and just gets into her own dance zen mode.  Kind of weird.  I personally do not like to look at the screen during my workouts.  I prefer to maintain proper form and spinal alignment and depend on auditory cues often.  Even after previewing this first, it is difficult to follow since she does not cue much at all.  The video seems long and drab.  I prefer Ellen Barrett for this style fitness training.  She has impeccable cuing and her DVDs are very fluid and go by quickly leaving you feeling stretched, strengthened and energized.  But if you like repetitive motions (major burn) while looking at the instructor, Tracy will be fine for you.  There is no denying that doing this workout will tone you.  But it just won't be fun.",1347580800,,908,4.75

BUT SHE COULD NOT LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD.  I can understand how, in principle, she might WANT us all to be able to commit to SIXTY MINUTES several days a week EVEN THO THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DIVIDED INTO 5 SEGMENTS FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING.  So instead, I find myself laboriously FAST FORWARDING to each SEGMENT (and she certainly knows that are indeed segments, because the DVD goes to BLACK IN BETWEEN EACH). So in case anyone else would have liked to CHOOSE what they actually have the time for each morning/day...here's my approximate breakdown)

PART 2.  21:00  (Standing -no equipment)
PART 3.  33:00  ARMS (weights)
PART 4.  41:00  LEGS (mat)

3562219,2,B001F2HZHI,"I purchased this DVD to replace my strength training workout.  Don't get me wrong, I love the strength and muscle that comes from lifting weights, and as a 5'0"" skinny girl, strength training gave me nicer, shapelier legs, a nice round butt, and nice shoulders and back.  That being said, I was noticing some bulk and decided to try this DVD after all the positive reviews (some, I suspect, which are fake).  The DVD itself is good quality and it's easy to see and hear the instructor.  Like most reviewers, I found the lack of explanation for each exercise perplexing and frustrating.  Still, I plowed through and managed to complete the workout 4 times a week and ran my usual 2-3 miles 3 times a week.  After a month, I noticed that my shoulders are more defined but my triceps and biceps are non-existent.  I noticed that my butt is still firm and high but much smaller (not something I like), and my hips are narrower.  Furthermore, my legs (quads, glutes, and calfs) are not as toned as they used to be with strength training and my stomach actually seems bigger. Before, I had a nice natural cinch at my waist, and now my waist is basically square shaped. I look like a 12-year old boy!  This workout was a nice change of pace, but if you want to keep your curves, stick to strength training alternating with pilates (which is what I'm doing now to get my body back).",1346889600,5,1374,4.464

If you want a challenge right away, I would say purchase it now, but if your body is weak because you haven't exercised in a while...I would defintely work your way up to getting your muscle's used to working out and then purchase this video...thanks Janice Baker =)",1346284800,,712,4.360902255639098
3562222,2,B001F2HZHI,"I was frustrated by the lack of explanation/description of the moves.  It was often difficult to tell from just watching her what she was specifically doing, especially with virtually no verbal cuing at all.  Just the tilt of the body or adjustment of the legs or arms can make a huge difference in what you are working, or straining, so it would have been valuable to have more descriptors.  I found the lack of actual instruction extremely frustrating particularly in the standing ab section where Tracy just seemed to be doing some sort of free-flow dance style moves that were difficult to anticipate or duplicate.  It doesn't help that there were limited camera angles used, so you couldn't analyze her form.  In some sections where she is using the chair, the moves are behind her and between the chair and her own body, the move she is doing is completely obstructed.

That being said, it was nice to do something different for a change.  I do have some back problems, which is why I appreciate more instruction and I my back is sore from my work out.  No doubt it is a form issue, which I will have to practice adjusting on my own, since the instruction was so weak.  I don't imagine I will do this work out often, but I think it will be nice to use occasionally for a change of pace.",1345852800,3,1292,4.463829787234043

3562235,3,B001F2HZHI,"do I think Tracy has a good workout method, yes.  That is not what this is about.  There is clearly a disconnect btw her ability to get people fit and the technology people she hires to do her videos.

in a nutshell, be prepared to do the entire video bc it's almost impossible to fast-forward to any section if you are short for time and just want to do legs and some abs.  you have to fast-forward through the entire video bc there are no chapters.  And it's slow to fast forward and takes patience which I don't have in the AM.

in addition, she really doesn't give much instruction on how to do the moves and the camera doesn't pick up the angles bc it shoots straight on.  be prepared to be wondering if you have the right angle, should your foot be flexed, etc.

would I buy this again, yes.  But I hope some Tracy Anderson folks are reading these reviews bc I don't think it costs anymore to just make the video more customer friendly w chapters and have Tracy explain the positions better.

I don't think videos are her best way to instruct people.  her studios (if you can afford them and live in NYC or the Hamptons) is probably the best way to go :)",1342051200,3,1160,4.2272727272727275

3562241,5,B001F2HZHI,"Been teaching fitness for over 25 years. I teach most everything (Pilates, cyle, Zumba, Yoga, weights, kickbox, ballet barre, etc, etc.....) A size 00 (after Tracy workout) before a size 2-4.
My skinny jeans fit beautifully thanks to this workout, but more importantly I'm pain free!!! I'm
missing a ligament in my pelvis. Physical Therapy helped to build by accessory
muscles ~ Tracy's term, I use ancillary muscles. Tracy focuses on the Glute medius!!! The best muscle to
keep strong to reduce back, pelvis and posture pain. As a result of doing her Mat video, I become stronger, more
defined and leaner!!!! It's a miracle and very strange, a mystery, how well this workout works. It's not like you are out of breath, or experience strenuous bouts of strength, however, after 3x my back feels amazing and my clothes are lose.

Again, I'm an instructor, an excellent one at that. I teach sometimes over 200 people a day at many large clubs and private clubs. I understand all the reviews re: queuing, or lack of it. The music, the reps, the excercise, believe me after 25 years of teaching I heard it all and I understand it all. What people need to realize is Tracy is SO 10 steps ahead of us all and truly has figured out a method, sequence of excersices that do exactly what she says will do. Create lean, tiny, strong bodies. Whether the rest works for you or not (music, her eyeballs looking away, the exercises) this video is the real deal. It really does work. Truly. I must add I have dual acl repairs and meniscus damage in both knees and this work out is amazing in the fact I can do it pain free and injured ;-). In the past I would teach more, or run more, or do one more bootcamp class to get the results Tracy gets. This did not work! I love the slow twitch muscle fibers as they burn fat! Fast twitch muscle fibers like sugar. I ended up eating a little more when I did other forms of strength that wasn't Tracy's method. Then I tried not eating more when doing bootcamp and to my shock I still didn't get tiny and I was in pain. Don't be fooled. Her method is not to be compared with any other out there! No comparison to barre, ph57, etc!!! Tracy has it mastered down to every arm circle.

For the cardio, I teach Zumba and walk an hour. I alternate the two. In the metamorphosis the cardio is great however I find the bpm at 132? and with my knees I need 144 to use more momentum to relieve the work load on the joints. That's just me. I just ordered her mini tramp workout~ we will see.

3562242,2,B001F2HZHI,"Tracy is hard to follow. She doesn't talk much, so you need to watch her at all times. I don't like it. I am always little behind . It's interesting workout, but she is sort of dancing each move.",1337040000,,195,4.0256410256410255
3562243,3,B001F2HZHI,"Last year I lived in a rural village in Eurasia that obviously didn't allow me the luxury of going to any gym. Jogging or long distance walking was also out of the question due to the dangerous potholes in the road, angry homeless dogs, cow poop, and the locals never really seeing anyone running before. The site of a strange foreigner in shorts (taboo here) running down the street causes many scandals! So in other words, I have been completely dependent upon exercise videos. Last summer I was not working and so I had all the time in world to do her method with required 2 hours of work per day 5 to 6 days per week- ONLY her mat and dance cardio. I am aware that the average working mom, or just human in general does not have such time to devote 2 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week, but I had such time, so I am a good candidate to test out her method- which didn't really work. So I want to save those busy women out there some time- don't do this method! Even though I had all the time in the world, I felt like my day was zapped and that I had no time, and I was so bored with the tapes by week 3 that I dreaded each workout- but I pushed through for almost 7 weeks (I kept a diary).

About me- moderate metabolism, 39, and often with an extra 10 pounds-usually a size 8 and sometimes 6ish. So I am just the right type IMO to test her out. Many people claim to have lost lost of weight with her method, but we don't know how much they had to lose. If you have alot of weight to lose then ANY exercise program is going to work. I always wish reviewers to flat out tell us if they are trying to lose just 10 to 15 pounds or if they are over 200 pounds. And so many of these reviews state that they have only had one or two weeks of working out, I like to read more about long term results. So my results were that I possibly lost about 3 to 4 pounds in 7 weeks, which is not enough in my opinion for doing so much work. I started out at doing 6 days a week, but later reduced to 4 to 5 days per week out of utter boredom, but did nothing else but walk. I also eat fabulous over here due to all the organic food straight from the farm and little access to crap.

Positives- I like her style and I love ballet moves. I adore doing any workout that does not require tons of squats and lunges in which I hate. Other people have criticized her ab work, but I actually liked it. I want to have the long lean flat stomach of Tracy. Maybe it helped my abs a bit, but still- one cannot really spot reduce and I did not do enough serious weights to burn more fat. I also like that she doesn't do too much talking- this is good considering she wants you to watch her for 12 hours per week. However, I do need a bit of cheerleading and tough love that other instructors may give me, but they are not asking me to do their videos 6 times a week and so they are tolerable.  I loved her arms as well. My boyfriend definitely noticed a difference in my arms- I will say that I did develope teeny, tiny, ballet arms. I guess the legs were OK, but I am a lucky person who tones up quite well in my legs. My stomach is the problem area. I also liked her warm-up and cool-down, it was a bit of dancing and ballet type moves that I enjoyed, and again- no squats- yeah!!

Negatives- Again, little results for so much work. And it turned into a big snooze fest after the 3rd week, I can still hear the music from the video in my head probably every day! It did not work my back or bum at all. My waist was probably the same and my booty still had a bit of cellulite under my bum and had some saddle bags. My thighs and calves were shaped alright from the cardio- don't know if the mat did much help. Another problem that I will address in my future review of her cardio (which I actually like) is that she wants us to always start with the mat first to burn the glycemic something- I forgot what she was discussing exactly. So I would do her mat first and get bored and then only be able to make it through a few songs on the cardio. When I did the reverse- cardio first and then the mat, I was able to get through most of the cardio, and the cardio did get my heart pumping. But when I did the mat first- the cardio got short changed.

So in a nutshell- if you like her and she works for you- go for it, and if you have such time to do it! I had time to do her, but was so burnt out and felt like 2 hours of my day was wasted. I still like her in general, but her method is just too tedious for those of us who do not bulk up and who have only 10 to 15 pounds to lose. The arms will get tiny- I still do the arm exercises often. I still like the mat, but not for usage of 6 days per week. I am putting it in my rotation. I still do not know what her current videos are doing because she is charging $90 for her new stuff that she only requires 1 hour per day to do. Maybe if I had the bucks and started out with her current videos things would be different. I still think that for most of us, her method will not work and takes up too much time. She is still good to keep in your rotation schedule when you want something different.

3562245,1,B001F2HZHI,"After seeing the segment on Oprah & being prodded by a friend, I plunked down the $30 for this video. I was hesistant, especially with the $30 price. There are very few workout videos out there that cost this much (most are in the $10-15 range). I figured if Oprah & Gwyneth vouched for her, I could sacrifice $30.

So I bought it & did the Method for a while. It was okay & I honestly cannot say whether I lost lbs. or inches. It's a bit of an odd video. She seems very sexualized & not totally engaged in the workout. There isn't a whole lot of instruction, either. She sure does love to show off her body & her moves & it seems she is pretty darn proud of her teeny, tiny body & her big pearly smile.

The DVD got shelved for a while due to boredom.

Then time passed. I ended up working with a personal trainer for several months & had awesome results. I didn't want to keep paying all that money so I stopped for a while & gained some of the weight back.

Fast forward a few months later. I looked into a few DVD programs & figured I'd give the TA Metamorphosis a try (out $100, ouch). I should have followed my gut & saved that money.

Now, I feel like a complete fool. I didn't do proper research before spending that money. After looking over the diet plan for Metamorphosis, I was alarmed by what seemed to be a very low daily calorie intake (we're talking anorexia style). After researching this, I read a few blogs that confirmed what I thought & I also discovered Ms. Anderson's sordid past during this research & all the disgruntled clients this woman has left in the midwest & the alleged $$$ she bilked from them. Add Gwyneth Paltrow's new disease (it's alleged her diet & lack of certain key nutrients & her hard training have led this diagnosis of osteopenia) & I am definitely going to steer clear of TA's Method & Metamorphosis.

After all the research I've done, I cannot find any credentials or training this woman has other than her self-described 8 years of research (was this at a university?) & background in dance (were these tap-dancing classes at age 12?) - I cannot find any concrete evidence of training in fitness or dance. I am going to listen to my gut on this & completely retire these DVDs to the shelf. Please do your research before spending your hard-earned money on this DVD & don't get duped like I did. My number one priority is my health & I just don't feel the DVDs & TA information is a safe way to go about it. If you want to read more about this trainer, look into the article in the Indianopolis Monthly from late last year. It reads like a soap opera.",1334966400,14,2599,4.283095723014257

Having to crane your head up to see what's she's going to do next ruins the movement.

3562249,5,B001F2HZHI,"I basically stalked Tracy Anderson's DVDs before finally settling on this one. I started it yesterday (Wednesday) and woke up this morning with my arms EN FUEGO (on fire). I have NO clue what these people here are talking about when they say that there is no instruction or that you can't see what she's doing. In fact, she is quite clear and even tells you what you should be feeling where so you know you are doing things correctly. Yes, she does do different counts, but to be honest, I don't know of one exercise person that doesn't. You can just do the opposite every other day to even it out if it bothers you. It's not really that high an amount of difference.

The hardest part of this DVD is that IT WORKS. I felt everything that I had done yesterday in my every day life today as well as during my workout. In fact, I had to do the weighted arm section without weights because I couldn't take it. I am picking up 1 pound weights tomorrow before my work out. ***Another reviewer wasn't sure about the 3 pound weight thing - Tracy explains that higher weights will cause women to bulk up, causing a ""pocket"" for excess skin. Judging from the arms on all who follow the TAM, I would listen to her.***

All in all, I can tell that I am going to get the results that I was looking for. I can't remember any DVD I have ever done that has me looking forward to doing it. I couldn't even do the standing legs yesterday and I pushed through them today because I want the results. If you don't like the workout, you won't do it. If you don't DO the workout, you don't get the results.

I have been walking for an hour for my cardio as well as following Atkins. I will come back on day 30 with my results (I am on to her Omnicentric Metamorphosis program after this).",1329436800,5,1766,4.218934911242603
3562250,5,B001F2HZHI,"I love this DVD.  I just did it today.  I wasn't bothered by the lack of cues at all and hardly noticed it really except for having read the amazon reviews.  Her moves are organic and flowy and it would be awkward if she described every little movement. With that also comes a bit of freedom with the exercise.  I like not feeling 'instructed' for an hour and just like I was in a real dance class (the workout portion of a dance class).  She gave cues where they were necessary.  It was just enjoyable and although it is an hour it flew by!  The moves aren't boxy and corny like most videos, they are graceful, elegant, and dancer like.  You also feel like you're doing your body good!  I love that she's not yapping or instructing the whole time so you can ""get into it"" and just be and forget that you're working out (except when it hurts.. ha!)  Afterward I had that workout ""high"" and my body felt strong from the inside.  I love that feeling!

I have gained a lot of weight recently and feel like a brick house under my skin, but doing the video made me feel sexy and feminine again because the movements ask you to move in that way if you choose to, and Tracy too feels comfortable being sexy and feminine while working out.  (Not overly so, just natural.)

I think a lot of people dread exercise because exercise usually commands energy fro you before you have it to give.  With this video, it's not cardio, it's muscle-toning and was actually relaxing to get into!  We actually eased into the workout and eased out of it.  I really liked that.  The video is an hour because she actually does a full warm up and cool down with you which most videos skip these days because they know everyone is looking for that low time number.

Finally, I know Tracy is designing my body in a way I personally prefer.  I don't particularly care to have a hard six pack that you can see.  I just like that line down the middle and flat.  I also don't want Madonna arms or the big stocky aerobics thighs or thick (although strong) middles that you see in a lot of other workout videos.  Fine for anyone else, that's just not how I desire my body to be personally. I really enjoyed this video for all these reasons and am excited to try more of her workouts.",1329264000,3,2248,4.287410926365796
3562251,3,B001F2HZHI,"This workout is very different from your traditional strength training DVD and is not for everyone.

First, the bad:

1) Almost no cues or instruction.  Several times during the workout, I would be in a position or rep and then look up to find I had been left behind with no warning (a simple ""switch"" or ""and...up"" would have sufficed!) You have to watch her like a hawk to know what moves are next and how to do them.  This snotty, ""too cool to talk to you"" attitude really got under my skin after a while.

2) A lot of wasted time.  A full hour seems excessive for a workout that includes no cardio (Tracy says herself that this mat workout must be supplemented with cardio.) The warm up and cool down are mostly to blame, as they are overly long and repetitive.  It also struck me as a waste that the arm and leg reps were kept completely separate... I feel like I could have been doing SOMETHING with the legs while the arms were working, and vice versa.

3) No skipping through segments.  Like most people, I don't have an hour to commit to exercise every morning.  It would have been nice to be able to choose which segments to watch, if I only have half an hour and want to focus on one area.

4) The standing ab segment is laughable and useless unless you are looking to work on your ""dance club"" moves.

The good:

1) Her method of exhausting a muscle group before moving onto the next is very effective (if not painful!)  The legs, lying abs, and arm workout especially are killer.  If you commit to doing these on a regular basis, she promises toned, non-bulky muscles.  While I haven't done it long enough to see results yet, I definitely FEEL the soreness the next day!

2) Some people complain about the music, but personally I think it works great with the workout.  Very non-intrusive and low-key.  Best way I can describe it is ""chill lounge music"".

In short, there are some serious flaws to this workout that make it overpriced; however it may be worth a try if you're wanting to sculpt a feminine, toned figure and have the time to commit to it.",1328486400,,2066,4.3727034120734904

I would definitely take it easy the first few times, you could really hurt yourself. The only problem I had with this dvd is that it absolutely ruined my dvd player.  I don't know how but it was working fine and then I played this tape and it'll no longer read any dvds, I then tried to play it in my xbox and it ruined that too! I had to send the xbox in for a repair with microsoft because of it.  The only thing that will play it without totally breaking down is my old old macbook.

Tracy's method has transformed my body completely, into a lean, sleek, firm, and feminine figure that is really incredible. and all in the comfort of my own home! of course i paired this with running, but these exercises really do help with strength training and together lost about 15-18lbs. my only complaint is that the repetitions for each side (left arm, right arm) aren't the same - like she would have a set of 20 for the right vs. only 10 for the left. but you can adjust accordingly. another thing is that she doesn't really explain very much as she's introducing new movements so at the beginning it was a little confusing. of course i've been doing this for a year now so i've memorized it, but it'll take at least a few times for newbies!",1327881600,4,872,4.388888888888889

Happily, I love this workout and enjoy the exercises, which aren't the same old boring leg lifts/crunches I'd been doing for too long. I totally agree with Tracy about avoiding six-pack abs (ugly!) and about not using weights over 3 lbs.  I used to lift heavier weights and wound up with the same loose skin Tracy warns against.

One thing I especially appreciate is that Tracy keeps the chat to a minimum.  Too many instructors jabber more than is necessary. And I absolutely love the music she uses.  It reminds me of living in Europe.",1325808000,3,632,4.657657657657658
3562266,4,B001F2HZHI,"Great workout, challenging for a former overweight couch potato turned somewhat fit workout junkie.

Likes: Interesting leg workout, it's different than most exercise DVD's. For the first couple of times I did it, my standing leg felt like it was going to collapse from the pain of supporting the working leg. I'm not sure what was up with that, but obviously, some muscle was clearly underworked! The standing arm sequence is tough. I had some loose skin from considerable weight loss, and this has really helped either tighten it up, or build up the muscles enough to re-stretch it so it's not as wrinkled looking. From reading, I see lots of people don't like the standing abs series, but I enjoy it. I look rather robotic doing it, but at 5am in my basement, who cares?

Dislikes: I hate, hate, hate the music! I find myself listening to the words of the music and analyzing what the singer is trying to say ..... ""Stand Like A Butterfly?"" Huh?  Shouldn't I be paying attention to Tracy's movements, and my own, and not listening to some corny music? It would be a lot better with instrumental dance music instead of new-age flaky garbage.

Bottom line, it works. Really well. Annoying music aside.",1324166400,,1202,4.70952380952381
3562267,4,B001F2HZHI,"i did this MAT workout for the first time this afternoon, after learning and doing routine 1 of the DANCE CARDIO (about 30 mins).
i watched it first last night beginning to end bc of the reviews stating there is a lack of cues.
i had no troubles following along.
this was major difficult to complete, but i finished.
my arms burned and my gluts too!
at times i did reps @ 1/2 tempo or i made my movements smaller.
i paused about 4 times and wanted to quit but i wanted to finish more...
i think after doing this for a month i might be able to complete all the reps and not stop, hopefully! i'm realistic!

this was sort of a mock trial of Metamorphosis = cardio + mat ~2hrs workout, i needed to see if my ankle injury has healed enough to go thru high intensity for such a prolonged time.  So i wrapped my ankle lightly (and my wrist too!) and i'm glad to say that i finished and i feel fine (minus the burn throughout my whole body)and it was really difficult but fun!
after i reach my initial goal to lose 25 lbs (in addition to the 35 i lost working with a personal trainer over 4 months plus 2 months of kettleworx), then i will switch to METAMORPHOSIS bc i think it would be hard on my wrists and knees to do cardio plus musculoskeletal work 6 days per week at this time, but i look forward to it maybe in jan or feb 2012!",1322870400,,1327,4.061068702290076

After working out to Jillian for a year I can't tell you what a nice change it is not to have someone screaming at me when I am in the throes of agony!!!  That is one of the best things about this DVD.  When she does talk, I think it is perfect, somehow just what I wanted to hear and so motivating.  I just get her, I guess because to me she is down to earth, not weird or making jokes that aren't funny and just annoying.  I imagine she is how I would be if I had to instruct a class, maybe that is why I like her so much.  The workout itself is such a nice change from typical weight training!!!  Somehow I feel satisfied that the workout was sufficiently dificult without having to throw heavy weights around for an hour and for me that's the difference between sticking with exercise or just giving up, so thank you Tracy! The arm workout is incredible, so so hard but such a good feeling to be able to get through it, this dvd is worth it just for the arm section alone.

I watch an Usher concert on the telly,whilst doing the Mat Dvd, and bam, time goes by in a blink! Sathiglly brillant idea. Fit and tone withought having to leave my Pug at home.:) You can use/watch any concert whilst working the mat portion-it works wonderfully.
This is absoutley the eaisest way to stay fit and trim. Mixed with some outside cardio, I prefer but one can  get by on Tracy's cardo dvd. Equally as difficult yet fun.",1321401600,,694,4.588709677419355
3562270,4,B001F2HZHI,"I have to admit, I was hesitant to try this workout as there were SO MANY negative reviews, which frankly, now, after doing it for 2 weeks, I'm not sure I understand.  You have to use a lot of muscle control and precision but um, hello, isn't that the point of working out?! Sure, you're not working major muscle groups, but like a lot of people, I find that I tend to bulk up when I lift heavy weights, despite what all the 'experts' say.  Maybe that works if you eat nothing but protein but believe me, I eat a pretty clean diet and I was not achieving the results I wanted through typical strength training and cardio.  I do agree that Tracy Anderson herself is a bit annoying; all the dance-y movements and the posturing - not cute and not helpful, but seriously, if you ignore that and just do the movements and get through it, i think it might be worth it.  Also, the standing ab section is pure crap - i either get down on the floor and do crunches or spend the time doing squats and lunges. I also find that as an advanced exerciser, I could actually add weights to the floor leg workout, but we'll see how that goes.
I just don't see what all the fuss is - if you've read any gossip blogs/news website, you know the hype/controversy re: Tracy Anderson, so either get on board or avoid.  Simple as that.
Anyway, like I stated earlier, it's only been 2 weeks, so this could all be crap, but I think this might actually work to create long, lean muscles.  Fingers crossed!",1320883200,2,1478,4.279569892473118

3562272,2,B001F2HZHI,"This workout is approximately 56 minutes long; only about 15 minutes or so are actually done on the mat, i.e., supine, prone, or on one's side.  Apparently because she is standing on a mat while doing exercises, Anderson considers it a mat workout.

The workout portion of the DVD is not chaptered (or at least the one I have isn't) which makes it as tiresome as a video tape because you have to speed through it if you only want to do certain sections of the workout.

Instructions are minimal.  While executing an exercise, she changes what she's doing at will (e.g., her arm movements) and mostly without any warning.

The standing ab portion of this workout is laughable and seems useless, especially considering the poochy look of Anderson's own stomach.

Overall I found Anderson's demeanor annoying and the exercises nothing special, unusual, or particularly effective.  I have found better results in less time with the Exhale/Core Fusion workouts.",1320710400,,956,4.9748427672955975

I'm sure, SURE, you get great results but if i'm not going to do it, i'm not getting any results.  Give us the non-Gwenyth Paltrow version, Tracy!

She doesn't give the right amount of instruction-you constantly have to watch the screen to know what she is doing as she moves to the next move or changes it without any verbal clues.  She has very odd facial expressions and bashes people with muscular bodies, saying things like women don't look good with six-pack abs.  Hmm, good to know what you think, but not helpful in my life!  I do 3-4 DVDs per week, I rarely pull this one out more than once a month.  I only do because it was so expensive and I figure I must be missing something!

Note: The program does not claim to be scientific, and no cautions of any kind are given (most exercise videos have a disclaimer and suggestion to consult a doctor before starting an exercise program). There are no clear directions for any movement. This is an 'unscientific' routine that works for those who keep at it.",1319241600,,596,4.786407766990291

The ab work was the best thing I can say about it. The arms are mainly working your deltoids and I didn't get any tricep work at all. It is also lacking in inner thigh work almost completely, except for some light plie's. I can say it works your hips but I haven't felt anything in my butt and I've done the work out everyday for the last 4 days. The instruction leaves alot to be desired and I feel the camera person could have made up for that by showing more angles of the moves to help us learn by watching, but that doesn't happen. She does this strange rib isolation which is something I am familiar with from dance, but she spent WAY too much time on it with again no instruction other then to say ""it takes time to achieve"" It would have been better for her to do it 1/2 time to teach us, instead of double time on a diagnle for god sake! The funny thing is it's titled ""Mat"" workout and yet very little of it is even on the mat. Even the cool down was on foot, when your instincts are to stay down on the mat to stretch!

I sprained my foot about 6 months ago and couldn't go to the gym so I had to find something that I could do at home and on the floor.  There are a lot of moves that require you to stand but you can do most of them sitting down.  This is not a typical exercise video.  She won't tell you every move and how many more reps you have left but that is what I like about it.  This video is a perfect full body workout.  You don't need a lot of room to do this video.  Some of the moves can be done while you are standing doing dishes or sitting on the couch watching tv.  I would highly recommend this to anyone but be aware that you won't get every move the first time or even the 10th time.  It is TOTALLY worth it though!!,1317081600,2,890,3.808743169398907
3562283,5,B001F2HZHI,"I'm 40. About 3 years ago, my father died and I almost immediately gained 20 pounds. I became pregnant soon after and could not lose the weight after my child was born. I'd always been able to maintain my weight via dance class (6 times a week), but this kind of commitment became impossible once I had a small child (travel to class=45 minutes, plus 1 hour and a half class, plus 45 minute return trip, 6 times a week =hefty babysitting expenses for vanity).

The name Tracy Anderson started popping up on blogs. She had her ardent defenders, but quite often, the ""elite"" bloggers seemed to make fun of her. There was plenty of reason to--if you are a skeptic and married to your skepticism. Anderson was training Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow. Her methods were often in direct opposition to what a decade of weight training for women had dictated (lift more weights!). She seemed to have emerged from nowhere to live a charmed life. She was accused of putting people on starvation diets and helping the already thin become more thin. Gwyneth moaned about her shar pei like pooch and yet, none of us ever saw any glaring defects in Ms. Paltrow's posterior. And Madonna--hadn't she always been dancing and showing off her body? It wasn't as though Anderson had brought someone like, say, Jennifer Hudson or Kirstie Alley back from the abyss.

Still, something about her ""method"" intrigued me. As a dancer, I was accustomed to relying on ballet to firm up my hips and butt and thighs, jazz for abs and hip hop for arms. Then there was floor barre class and the extra Callanetics I did at night. It was a substantial investment of time. More than once I wondered why someone couldn't just condense the very best of these moves. I tried Pilates and it can be effective, but it still works best in conjunction with dance. It's not a surprise that so many dancers teach pilates--my own ballet teacher always said to me: ""If you can do ballet, then do ballet. It's better than pilates.""

Tracy Anderson has in fact put together a magical method that borrows from the very best of all these exercise traditions, and others. I used this Mat DVD and in 10 weeks, my body changed substantially. I lost 3.5 inches from my waist, 3 inches from my hips and 4.5 inches from my thighs. I did not follow her diet (which you can find online if you look hard enough, or pick up in one of her books), but stopped eating most white flour and stopped putting sugar in my coffee (I am now back eating some whole grains and maintaining my weight). I lost 11 pounds. The weight change, though, wasn't as remarkable as the re-shaping. I literally don't have a single pair of pants that fit any more. All this took 10 weeks. I now weigh what I did in my late 20s at the peak of my dancing mania. And for those who say that Anderson's method primarily relies on weight loss, I would like to point out that the clothes I wore in my late 20s are also too large--it is not just weight that you will lose, but inches.

If you are a fitness devotee or a dancer (or ex-dancer), then you'll pick up the moves easily and intuitively understand what she is trying to do. I do not think this DVD is for a beginner, though I would certainly never stop anyone from trying to do the workout. I have now moved on to Anderson's Metamorphosis program, though I still occasionally supplement that with moves from the Mat DVD--it's that good. I finally have a way to work out at home. And while I have not given up dance--I find that Anderson's method actually complements dance class very well--I do feel relieved that I have a way to workout whenever I want to.

As for how this Method compares to similar exercises: as I mentioned above, Tracy's moves target the body's troublesome areas in a way that one dance class can't. To replicate in dance class what Anderson does in an hour (or less), you'd literally have to be a professional dancer, in the studio 6 hours a day. This is not a realistic way to live or work for people who just want to reach a high level of fitness.

I have loved Callanetics in the past, but do find the moves begin to stall. There was never enough variation in Callanetics, and there was never a true cardio component (research Anderson's programs and you'll find a cardio component) and the arm section was always weak. With Anderson's DVD, I actually have rather sleek arms for the first time in my life. Also, Anderson's found a way to put a program out there that will help fitness seekers continue to improve. With Callanetics, there was always a point where you were going to stall, or simply maintain. It's more fun to work out if you feel that you are constantly trying to excel. That's why dancers dance in part--to always do and learn something new. There is no point to just doing a plie over and over again without it leading to something else. Anderson's program understands this psychology, and continues to give its users something new to learn to do.

As for the weight lifting debate--some trainers are incensed by Anderson's limiting of weights to 3 pounds. I'm a mesomorph. I can lift a lot of weight, but I did not like the way my thighs, calves, shoulders and neck changed as a result of lifting (which I also tried for a period in my twenties). Perhaps I didn't bulk exactly (as we are told over and over again that women cannot bulk), but my muscles did tighten up and the overall effect was not something I liked--I just looked thicker. I did not like the way my clothes fit. I did not like that I gained muscle weight. This doesn't happen with Tracy's program.

I've never written a review for an exercise DVD before. I write very few reviews period. And I'm about as skeptical as they come--the tyranny of celebrities and hype surrounding personalities in general irritate me. Anderson's introduction into this world was certainly helped by the friends she made. On the other hand, there is a reason that successful women flock to her--Anderson actually delivers the goods. If you do what she ways, your body will change. The program will not fail. I can't recommend this DVD--and the Method in general--enough to women who want to change their bodies.",1316304000,102,6162,4.530098831985624
3562284,2,B001F2HZHI,I am an avid exerciser and am always up for a challenge however I was very disappointed with this DVD.  Tracy Anderson looks like she is too concerned about how she looks while doing the moves which is annoying and she never ever gives full instructions! I don't recommend this video at all I would say go with Jillian Michael's now she is a real trainer!

3562285,4,B001F2HZHI,"I love this dvd! This is TA's first mat dvd and she gives a great workout, albeit with very little instruction. At the beginning this creates for a steep learning curve, especially since she uses moves that most people will not be familiar with. BUT, after you get the workout down, it is great. You don't have to worry about listening to her say the same thing over and over again. She also occasionally doesnt do the same amount of reps on each side/forgets the exercise order. You can easily overcome this by a)counting the reps and doing them evenly on both sides or b)starting the workout with opposite leg each time you do it. It is only for these production/performance reason that i give this dvde 4 stars. The workout itself I would give 5.
  TA gives you something fresh and effective in this workout. All you need is a chair, yoga mat (although you could probably do without), and 3lb weights. <--and don't scoff, her arm section is killer!!! The workout is about 50 min long, includes a warm-up and cool-down, standing and floor leg sections, standing and floor ab work, and standing arms. It is a great workout and one that I go back to time and time again!",1315180800,,1170,4.514150943396227
3562286,5,B001F2HZHI,"I decided to write a review because I've had the Mat DVD for about a year now and I get questions all the time about it from friends, and someone suggested I post a review, since we haven't seen one from someone who uses this dvd, but not the way it's advertised.

I typically workout all year round.  There are times where I take a week/ a few weeks/ sometimes a month off from going to the gym, and I definitely fall out of shape and gain weight.  When I am working out, it's typically running only.  I know Tracy doesn't like running, but I don't care... it's the only thing that makes me feel good, and honestly, you need to find what works for you with exercise and diet.  I really wanted to start seeing better results and I love the way her arms look, so I picked up this dvd.  For the past few months my workouts have consisted of my usual run and I do PARTS of the Mat dvd.  That's right... only PARTS.  I will not work out for two hours, I refuse... could I do it, yes.  Will it burn me out after two weeks and cause me to cease all exercise... yes.  So I don't.  My typical work out is a 4-5 mile run 5-6 days a week.  When I get home, I pop in the dvd and I do the first part of the leg moves (sometimes only the first chair sequence) and I do both arm routines (without weights and with).  When I do the arms portion, I use 2 lb weights.  The combination of running and then doing portions of this dvd, works very well for me.  Within a week, there is a definite change in my arms and shoulders.  I also notice my rear gets a little tighter and smaller after a few weeks/a month of the dvd.  I could probably speed up the results by doing the entire dvd, but I'm not obsessed with being teeny tiny, I just want to look good in my clothes, and feel better about myself.  And I'm realistic - I know I can't commit to doing a run and an entire dvd workout, so I do what I know I can commit to.

Doing parts of the dvd works for me when i'm trying to tone up and maybe have an extra 5-10 lbs and/or some inches (say from holidays, or the winter sluggishness in general) that I'm trying to lose.  it works pretty fast as well... even with food indulgences.  you just have to keep at it.  if you stop, the results go away.  if you can do the entire dvd, that's great.  but if you're like me, and running is something that's not just exercise but a stress reliever and something you generally love and enjoy - then keep doing it and add it parts of this dvd.  her arm workout alone makes buying this dvd worth it.  it will hurt.  it will hurt a lot.  give it 3-5 days and you will start to feel ok.  don't try to keep her pace if you can't.  progress up to it.  it really does work though, whether you do the whole dvd or only parts of it in addition to something else.",1315180800,19,2775,3.9909090909090907
3562287,4,B001F2HZHI,"I liked almost everything about this dvd. Some of the leg floor work can be a bit straining so be careful. The arm section will really tone up your arms just like she say's as long as you do it with some consistency. But theres a mis count in reps in the weight part of the arm workout that really annoyed me considering how much I payed for this dvd. It's not bargain priced. I mean, why wouldn't they fix that before selling the dvd? They have to know it's there. Other than that, the music is great and you will get great toning results as long as you do it.",1314835200,,561,4.063063063063063
3562288,3,B001F2HZHI,"Along with other reviews, this DVD could have been a lot better in terms of explaining how to do certain motions, and being more intricate. She could have also explained more about what each movement was doing; like most workout DVDs, but besides that - the DVD is great! I can feel my muscles working, so regardless... if you're good at mirroring others, this is a great DVD. Make sure you have plenty of room to work around in!

The standing movements are not very challenging.  If you like to dance - this may be for you.  If you want a decent workout, I would recommend another DVD.",1314316800,,333,4.222222222222222
3562290,4,B001F2HZHI,"I received this dvd a few weeks ago. I am enjoying this workout thoroughly.  It's challenging, which is great for a dvd because most dvd workouts (except the p90x) are so easy it's stupid.  I am in my early 20's, jog and do yoga regularly.  I am a massage therapist and my job can be very physically demanding so it is very important to stay in shape.  I had been searching for some time for a workout that was both challenging but wasn't all about lifting weights.  jogging and doing yoga have toned me up some and I have lost a few pounds but I tend to carry extra weight in my thighs and hips---not cute.

Plus side
This workout is very challenging! It took me a few times to be able to get through the whole thing in one shot.  The leg workout is my favorite! I love that it works the ""accessory"" muscles.. the adductors and abductors that are so hard to tone!  The arm workout is also challenging and unlike anything I've ever done! I love that she starts off just using your own body's resistance.. no need to use weights to tone up!  The abdominal exercises at the end are also great and very unique. She is great at working the muscle groups in many different ways, hitting all the problem areas and doing rotations that most workouts don't do!

Problems with this DVD
I have a mac laptop and unfortunately I realized that this dvd does not play on it.  That is disappointing because I don't always want to work out in the living room, sometimes its nice to take my laptop into a bedroom or other room in the house for a change of pace. The dvd also randomly skips, which is weird because it's brand new. The warm up and cool down are very short which can be very dangerous!!!!  If you are not limber you NEED to stretch for at least 15 minutes before and more importantly AFTER this video! PLEASE! I work on people every day who beat their muscles to death without properly warming up and cooling down and it is VERY easy to pull certain muscles, develop tendinitis or strain your joints if you are not careful enough during rough exercise.  Another problem with this video is the lack of explanation.  Don't expect her to explain any of the movements, it can be hard to keep up at first.  Another thing to be careful about is how fast you do these exercises.. don't move too fast! Take your time so you do not over exert yourself!

I definitely recommend doing yoga after or on the days in-between this workout to keep yourself limber and to help your range of motion!",1314230400,,2478,4.342733188720174
3562291,5,B001F2HZHI,"This DVD is an incredible alternative to the Bar Method, which I'd been doing for years, and which unfortunately started to negatively affect my knees and ankles (ugh, they are ruined now!). I kept hearing that you had to ""work through"" the joint pain (I used to go to BM classes) but jeez, if your knees and ankles are killing you, it is not a good sign! (see how gullible I am?)  Another thing--my legs got HUGE after doing the Bar Method consistently for a few months, and I was not amused.

Yes, especially the standing ab section--you are going to feel like a complete idiot, and I actually laughed out loud the first time I tried it, but I'm sticking with it. I love how fun and varied all the exercises are, and the music is not annoying. I just bought a load of Tracy's DVDS from QVC so that I can start rotating them around and not get bored (there are a million DVDS to buy, so I imagine there will always be something different waiting for me). QVC has most of here DVDS available at a fraction of a cost than what's on her website.

She does not give a complete play-by-play narration, so if you're someone who needs directions to a T, you are going to hate this. I was fine simply watching what she was doing.",1313971200,,1222,4.2813852813852815
3562292,4,B001F2HZHI,"REVISED REVIEW: I think all the points I made below are still very much true, but I bumped it up another star (I originally gave this one only three stars) because something makes me go back and do the workout again and again. If I just thought it was so-so, that wouldn't be the case. I find that I can force myself to get through it on days I really don't feel like working out, which is great.

------

There are other DVDs on the market that are similar, for example the Pure Barre series (which doesn't incorporate as much arm work) and the Exhale Core Fusion series (which tends to target specific areas like thighs and glutes or abs and arms). I find the style and approach in Pure Barre and Core Fusion more to my liking.

Pros of Tracy Anderson Mat Workout:
* Great music selection
* Well-rounded workout that focuses equally on most muscle groups
* Slightly longer than Pure Barre and Core Fusion workouts

Pros of Exhale Core Fusion and Pure Barre:
* More instruction: By ""instruction"" I don't mean only ""hold your leg like this,"" but even verbal cues so you don't have to look up at the screen and dangerously crane your neck all the time. Tracy didn't offer much of that.
* More likeable/accessible instructors (sorry - just a preference)
* Less focus on dance (again just a preference - lots of people would put this as a ""pro"" in the Mat Workout)
* Doesn't have what I thought was a pointless (though mercifully short) ""standing abs"" section that, to me, looked like an excuse for Tracy to strut her stuff.",1312848000,2,1521,4.460431654676259
3562311,5,B001F2HZHI,"Well, I gotta say I am happy to have ordered this workout, despite some of the negative reviews.

I have many workout systems: Brazilian Butt Lift, Turbo Jams, Turbo Fire, p90x, NYC Ballet, Pilates Method, Mini Pilates Ball, Resistance Bands workouts, Cardio Burning, 10 Minute Series (from kickboxing to yoga and everything in between), all of the Jillian Michaels workouts, Biggest Loswer Workouts, Cardio Max, Bender Ball, Hip Hop Abs, etc!

Why do I list all of these? To let you know that this is not a beginner tape. Listen, if you are very overweight and you think that by doing these ""toning pilatesesque moves"" is going to cut it- Get real! You need cardio and to change your diet! :) One of my master yoga teachers once told me, ""weight has nothing to do with yoga, but what goes in here (and she pointed towards her mouth."") THIS IS SO TRUE!

NOW FOR THE REVIEW:

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! OMG. I have simliar workouts, but this is a nice change of pace. Her direction isn't a Billy Blanks count aloud style, but if you just watch her, then you'll be FINE! Sure, there were a few moves I didn't get on the first or second try of MANY MANY reps, but it's okay, you will get it! This is only my first time doing the dvd, and I feel confident that by the 3rd time I'll  be totally there!!! And you know, even if you aren't, moving=buring calories! Besides, when was learning something new ever ""perfectly easy,"" and ""totally comfortable"" (or perhaps ""not a little embarrassing?"")

That is the beauty of this workout! Even though I have so many dvds and do yoga, this is different! That arm series... OMG! It's fantastic! Even when I was at my smallest point and doing pilates everyday (at the age of 19, now 29) I still had the saggy underarm... THIS WILL DO IT! I am sure!!!! I think that I will be using this dvd as much as possible or on a rest day (even though I burned 300 calories) until i hit my goal weight. For me, the last 10 pounds comes down to cardio. Once at my goal weight though, I can't wait to do this 5 times a week!!!

Sorry to be raving here, but I just can't get over all the bad reviews I read! I was skeptical, but glad I trusted my gut with this one. If you want to tone up, lose weight and more importantly look and feel you best and try something different- then do it!!!!! :)

I will try to post back my results, but it will be hard since I am doing Turbo Jams as well!!!!

*on a nicer side: to those uncoordinated, I feel you. We are all there and we all get ""down on ourselves."" But keep in mind, you can only get better! Every day is a new day! Every day is a second chance! Every day could be the day that you get it! So instead of being negative, just give it a go. And by that, I mean all of life! :) :) :) This made me feel fantastic, and I hope others feel the same way!",1312070400,6,2814,4.167587476979742

I love Tacy, the music, the moves-it is so unique and effective! This is on the top of my ""desert island discs"" for sure! My only complaint is that it is not properly chaptered. I think Tracy did not want you to skip and pick and choose segment-she wants you to do the whole thing from start to finish every time. It really is a must have for those who love barre, pliates and light weight-high rep work!",1312070400,,525,4.106796116504855
3562313,4,B001F2HZHI,"I am 5'3"", 130lbs and I don't have a dancer's genetics. I would describe myself as stocky and loose. After reading the other reviews here, I knew there wasn't much guidance on the DVD, but I was excited about changing my shape, so I gave it a try.

I do have dance background, though, so I didn't need a huge amount of guidance and didn't mind the lack of instruction. Sure it helps when you're learning, but if you like the workout and do it 100 times, you'll be glad Tracy's not gabbing at you, trying to be funny. On some of my other DVDs, I have every gaffe and bad joke memorized and it annoys me once I learn the workout. Something to consider.

So the basic premise is that this workout focuses on small, accessory muscle groups. It would stand to reason, because most of us don't have dancer bodies, that these muscles would be pretty weak. A few people here said they got injured when they tried this, and after watching it thru, I can see why. Just because you can shoulder press 20 lbs, don't think you'll be able to jump in, do a bunch of twisty shoulder exercises that work your rotator cuff (a main feature in the arm workout) and not get hurt.

So I watched it once, with the FF button on 10x so I could see what I was getting into. I could see I would have to get my hips, shoulders and back used to all the twists and rotations before I could do the workout full out. When I did the workout the first time, I knew I was right. I made NO effort to do all the reps, or make my movements as strong and high as Tracy's. I took LOTS of breaks, made sure my hips and shoulders stayed loose. It was NOT a good workout the first time through, but that wasn't my goal. I'd like to be able to do the workout 50 times so I can see results.

I will update in a month or two when I can report on results. For now, I really enjoyed my first time through. It was a little bit like being in dance class. I can see that the workout has potential for good results, but I'm going to ease my joints into it until I feel like I can do it full out. I suggest this for pretty much everybody who isn't actively dancing and using those smaller muscles on a regular basis.",1311897600,,2163,4.070422535211268

He works overseas for four weeks at a time, so when he came back he kept raving about the changes. I will probably get the Metamorphasis series as well.",1311033600,,409,4.0

She is more engaging, and this is a really great overall workout.  Yes, it's challenging, but the results are so worth it.  There are a few times where Tracy could give more direction (abs section), but if you watch her, you'll catch on.  I do this workout 1-2 times a week, and have seen (and feel) improvements.

3562318,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have been using at-home workouts since the Tae-bo and The Firm days and my biggest problem with them all is usually how incredibly irritating the instructors and music are throughout.  They tell stories, they scream at you, they count and then lose count and all of the rah-rah for someone who just wants to get in their hour and get on with their day is a turn-off.  More importantly, this is a DVD so if that's on the DVD then you are hearing it EVERY DAY.

This workout is straight-forward and thorough.  You will barely move but sweat.  She doesn't bark at you the whole time, she rarely counts down reps or says what to do next but for most of the dvd you are looking right at her so you can just copy her - not that hard.  Also, remember that you will be doing this about 5 days a week so you'll have it memorized soon enough and then you can make it your own.  The reviews on here that complain about a lack of instruction I think are from people who rarely work out using DVDs or are forgetting about the inevitable memorization of a routine and eventually muting the instructor after a couple weeks of hearing the same inspirational stories, comments or background music over and over.  This is for people who already work out and who don't need someone to hold their hand.  I can do this every day and not get bored because the moves fly by quickly and I can mentally check out like in a yoga class.  I do this late at night or early in the morning, lights dim, barefoot and its the most relaxing head-to-toe, muscle-burning workout possible.",1308355200,14,1554,4.346020761245675

You'll only really need 2 3-lb weights and a chair. It reminds me of Radu with the chair work.  Almost the same as Cindy's Shape Your Body.  I saw -amazing- results with that one in one month too.

My only gripe is production.  The editing is pretty bad, it blacks out in between scenes.  Her voice is sort of low and there's not a lot of description for the movements.  You can catch on and if you do it every day, I imagine you'll figure it all out.  She's great, but she needs someone better to produce and polish this.

And I am no stranger to workout DVDs.  Yes, I've had success with others, but the visible results from this DVD are shockingly quick and I feel GREAT.  My legs look fabulous, and my arms and shoulders are toned and sleak.  I LOVE wearing short sleeve shirts and tank tops now.  Yes, you really do get your limbs smaller and pulled in.  Not bulky like some other workouts have done to me in the past.  A dancer's body really is possible!

Everywhere I go I get compliments, and I have never been more confident!  I also do her post pregnancy DVD 2x a week because the ab section is killer.  Also, about 1.5 weeks ago I started doing the arm section in the Matt DVD 3x each workout.  So I generally fast forward to the arm section and do both the non-weighted and weighted arm section 3x in a row, then rewind to the begining and complete the remaining workout (skipping through the arm section).  WOW, what a difference it has made to my arms, but I will tell you that even though Tracy does not say this in the DVD, you will also be most impressed at how well the arm section tones your shoulders as well.

3562353,5,B001F2HZHI,"I was initially skeptical about Tracy's ""method."" However if you can get past her quirks I think it is actually a very good toning and strengthening workout using your own body weight and gravity to get at problem areas using ballet/pilates-like stretches at usual and unusual angles. I don't think stretches should be performed until the muscles are warm, so do my own warm up for a few minutes or some cardio, which is actually what I think she expects you to do beforehand - her dance cardio is too hard on my joints at present and too fast for my liking - for now at least because I have plantar fasciitis.

The major thing for me and why I won't deduct any stars for a lack of warm up and cueing is that it is so much fun to do and I don't tire of it easily as with other dvds in my collection, I can do it with my existing foot issues, no equipment is required and you can do it anywhere - even a small room. She is right that it leaves you feeling nicely worked out and toned all over with nothing strained. I find her quite likeable and like other reviewers have said - what do you care about most - results in a workout or having someone with a personality that doesn't grate you. I know the latter is important, but some people are just so picky I wonder how they get through life and stay happy.

I think in working out accessory muscles she is onto something, even if this is not an original idea, her particular style is pretty different - especially the arms section, as others have said. On review this dvd doesn't look at all hard - until you try it. The arms and standing abs sections take a bit of getting used to, but after a few attempts you do actually see what she is getting at. Worth a try if you like ballet-type toning exercises, want something modern and different and to become leaner and stronger at the same time.",1306195200,4,1843,4.232954545454546

I actually enjoy the fact that she does the entire workout with you but the lack of consistent coaching may bother some people. The first week it was difficult to completely do each series but my body caught up significantly after doing the workout a few times. For a toning video it's gets my heart rate up and I can already feel my muscles changing after a couple of weeks. Not a cardio workout by any means but a well spent hour on stretching/toning for a healthier body. Love it!,1306022400,,583,4.261261261261262
3562356,5,B001F2HZHI,"What it is:
1. dance inspired toning, meaning its not bulky toning like p90x
2. a pretty tough workout, it took me a long time to be able to do it without hitting pause to rest.
3. worth $30 because for me results were there, and very quickly.

What its not:
1. it is not high paced/cardio
2. does not focus on specific muscle groups like p90x, more fluid movements

I personally love this dvd. Is TA kind of annoying, yeah. I think that she is sexy and that comes thru in her workout, but I am okay with that because I am not very sexy and maybe I needed a little bit of instruction in that area?

Jackie Warner and Jilian Michaels are both in amazing shape and its just a different kind of shape. TA is more of a ballerina type, I suppose (a sexy one?). If you're looking for a super toned bulky defined look then p90x is a better option. For my type, p90x made me stumpy, I was toned but kinda husky I guess. I didn't like the way I looked at all and then when I stopped p90x I turned flabby.

I guess I really like this workout because I look defined but I am smaller,, and that was my goal all along. Also after a few weeks my body changed quite a bit, and I have gotten many compliments. Before dropping the $ on this dvd, decide what your body is like, if it tends to get stumpy like mine then I say go for it.",1304553600,38,1317,3.9961977186311786
3562357,5,B001F2HZHI,"I got this dvd about 2 years ago and I loved it from the start.  I still use it now and get great results (as I still can't do all the repetitions!).  I haven't used it every day for 2 years - just when I want to get into shape.  Some of the definition stays when I'm not doing the dvd regularly, but the really great results come from doing it most days a week.

Even without cardio, the mat workout really helps tighten things up a lot, and I love the muscles she targets.  It's true - the bigger muscles get pulled back in, along with the skin.  The skin becomes smoother and tighter.  My muffins top and saddle bags all got smoothed out without me even losing any weight.  Now I know about the perils of growing big triceps and making ""bingo wings"" I'm too scared to do anything else.

MY lifting strength has not really increased that much, but my core strength is incredible - similar to that of doing yoga or pilates, but the definition is much better.

My heart rate goes up into the fat burning zone for a lot of the mat workout anyway, so I normally do the hour mat workout first then cardio if I have time later.  I used to do just the first half of the dvd which is 30 mins, but obviously I am getting much better results now.

Now she has released new dvd I look forward to doing a new routine, but this dvd has lasted me a long time.

I really do believe she is a genius and I'd recommend this dvd to anyone.",1304121600,19,1422,4.071942446043166

I try to do the leg and arms at least every day when I don't have time to do 1 hour sequence but it really works.  The arm section is beautifully choreographed and it is really fun to do.

A lot of people might have negative opinions on Tracy's timidness and shyness as a performer or instructor but I don't really care what she personally is like as long as she provides a good exercise program and she does.",1303776000,,620,3.928

Tracy goes through a lot of moves very quickly without much instruction, in particular the ""stand up ab workout"" left me shouting at the TV the first time I watched, since it's basically just a free style dance.  But I've kind of gotten the hang of it now after doing it for a few weeks, and I really love it!

3562411,5,B001F2HZHI,"This DVD is superb for your arse, abs, and arms. One critique though is that she does more reps on one side than the other. My advice is to watch it first with a piece of paper and a pen handy and write down how many reps she does on the first side whilst watching it and when you do the DVD just look at your notes when doing the second side so you don't overdo it on one side. She also does this during arms and abs but I find that one can easily count the reps in their head and make sure they do the same on the opposite side since it is so fast paced during these parts and the reps are small so you don't loose track.

If anyone has any questions about any of her DVDs feel free to ask! Cheers!",1302307200,3,700,3.7945205479452055

But what we want when we buy a workout DVD is results - and WOW are there results.  I am shrinking before my own eyes and I want to run up to strangers on the street shouting ""LOOK! Look at my arms!"" lol.  Unbelievable.  I have hip bones, my stomach is flattening, my thighs are shrinking, my butt is lifting.  Put the time in, do it carefully, do it hard and do it well, and you will be amazed.  She doesn't talk much, but she knows what she is doing, no matter how weird it might seem!

For the little I could actually follow, its amazing, very little instruction on her part, so hard to sometimes follow along, i had to watch it serveral times to pick up on her counts and well the fact that I recevied a poor copy, which made it very frustrating. Its engaging and never gets boring, I love it hopefully I can return this video and get another new copy, otherwise I think I rather spend the money and buy it directly from her website.

Although Tracy doesn't give much instruction u can view it first check her counts and go for it! I love how it feels like ur just grooving to her workout I've tried other similar workouts by others and this one actually kept me engaged. Takes time to build up especially for me since have I have lower back spasms and tigthtness  but it's actually helping my back once I got through the initial pain. So much fun and motivating!!! Can't wait to buy her cardio (not from top net though) I think I will spend the extra $ and buy them off her sight because it's frustrating having to fast foward to get past the freezing spots!,1301702400,3,750,4.35
3562415,1,B001F2HZHI,"I bought this DVD, and let me tell you, this is the most exausting, boring and difficult workout I have ever attempted. This is my first review. I don't usually write reviews, and I buy A LOT of stuff on amazon, but this time I decided I should, because I always read reviews before purchasing.
Do not buy this DVD, unless you enjoy torturing yourself. Her promises are unrealistic, and I don't know who can benefit from it. First of all, if you are in such a good shape that you can manage 1 hour of cardio AND this 45 min DVD 5-6 times a week, you probably don't need it anyway. And if you are like most of us, not a professional athlete, you will get burned out, and regret spending $30 on it.
I got it, and used it for 2 weeks. It was extremely difficult the first week, manageable later, but guess what, background music started driving me nuts, and just to look at her, omg it makes me sick. Cmon, it's supposed to be fitness DVD, not playboy! She looks great and all that, but that's just not what I am paying for. I will never forget these 2 weeks, not to mention all the time wasted for nothing! BTW I am 5'8"" 135lbs, and just wanted to tone up. BAD. DO NOT BUY IT. ZERO stars.

I also worked out with a trainer for over a year. This dvd is definately different than anything else that I have tried.  I was very excited upon purchasing it, along with her book.  I have completed the dvd 5 times a week (alternated with web videos as she suggests) combined with cardio (I love her reformer cardio available online) for over three months now.  My butt and hamstrings look amazing.  I have more lift than I have ever had, and my jeans fit incredibly well.  The issues that I now have (which I did not have before) are with my arms and abs.  My shoulders are more toned than they were when I worked out with heavy weights, but the other muscles have actually lost tone.  My once beautiful bicep and tricep muscles are now almost non existant.  My abs do not look as good as they did before either (I should have known that this would happen because the abs section is a joke).  The back is also ignored.  I would like to continue doing the lower body exercises, but it will be a pain because she does not have a menu which allows you to choose that option (you have to forward through the video if you want to skip parts).  You would think that she could do is put together a decent menu, and have someone help her out with counting reps for the price of this dvd.  I am also skeptical about some of the 5 star reviewers on this product.  There are way too many glowing 5 star reviews from people that have never reviewed anything else.",1301356800,12,1585,4.292929292929293
3562418,3,B001F2HZHI,"There are some good things about this mat workout. I think the arms and legs are great workouts but she is inconsistent in her counting of reps so you have to be on top of doing the same amount on each side. I think the ab workout leaves something to be desired and ultimately, I ended up downloading another ab workout of hers from the internet and I add that to the ab workout in the DVD. I noticed results on my abs once I upped the amount I was doing, but have yet to see any difference in my legs & glutes after 3 weeks of 4-5x a week. I think it's a good change of pace but I don't think the workout has that great of a flow so you have to concentrate and do your own counting to make it work.",1301356800,,699,3.861111111111111
3562469,2,B001F2HZHI,"I have many of the Tracy Anderson DVDs and I like the workouts (steer clear of her dangerous diet!), but she needs to work on giving direction.  She will switch legs in the middle of the exercise and not say anything.  If you are on all fours doing the workout, it is impossible to watch her the whole time.  Her dance cardio is VERY hard to follow.  She changes her movements constantly without giving any direction, by the time you catch up she's moved on to something else. I'm sure when Gwyneth Paltrow works out with her one on one, the instruction its a far superior experience, but for those of us trying to follow at home it leaves a great deal to be desired.",1300752000,2,667,4.312

3562471,5,B001F2HZHI,"First of all you will only love this DVD if you have experience in Pilates, Barre, and/or dance.  I am a Pilates Instructor so I have the knowledge to apply principles such as neutral spine, imprint, rib cage placement etc to her moves since she does not cue those for the viewer.  If I didn't have the experience I have I probably wouldn't like this workout.  With that said....it is an AMAZING workout.  It wakes up your muscles and creates definition I have not gotten from any other form of exercise.  I had a personal trainer before my wedding and noticed I actually went up a pant size because it created so much bulk in my glutes.  This video will make you lean and sexy.

Tracy is a great trainer and I wish she would add a chapter selction to the DVD.  Sometimes I want to just do the arm section after I go for a run or something and I can't....sorta a pain.

I have to say I am not a fan of the standing ab section.  It does nothing for me, so I fast forward thru that section. Also, Tracy could do a better job of explaining technique and giving a little more instruction.",1300233600,,508,4.04

While I do agree there is a section that can be a little hard to follow, it really is only ONE section-- the isolation of the rib cages.  But seriously, just isolate and have fun, that's what's important.  I'm shocked to read a review on here saying that she expected to be on the mat the whole time.  Seriously??? the point is to transform your body, so I don't understand the complaint.  If she purchased the dvd to just do easy stuff while laying on the mat, then this workout isn't for you, but then don't complain when your body hasn't transformed.  Anyway, Tracy's workout is easy to follow, but challenging.  I'm glad I got it, and my arms burnt today :)",1300060800,3,786,4.386206896551724

I have mainly utilized pilates for my exercise routine in the past, so I was anticipating this video because it was labeled as a ""mat workout"" and I've heard great things about Tracy's skills in re-shaping celebrity bodies. Well, I was very disappointed. Only the last 10 minutes of this video is even done on the mat. Everything else requires you to be standing, with a chair...and then standing with hand weights. So that is two pieces of equipment that you need other than a mat. I also found this video to be quite boring and, as many other reviewers have said, Tracy is very difficult to follow because she changes moves erratically and doesn't instruct you very much. I also worried at a few points that I was straining my lower back, but she doesn't talk at all about alternate moves for beginners so I had no way of modifying her positions for my flexibility level. I also found the concept of muscle exhaustion to be just that - exhausting. The amount of reps you do - no matter what section of the video you are in - is just incredible! Almost 100 leg lifts on each side for just ONE move? Yeah. It was definitely worth trying, but this type of workout is not for me. I need more instruction and a LOT more variety.",1298592000,3,1275,4.383966244725738

I still feel ridiculous doing the standing ab work, but I will say that I can sort of feel it.  Plus, it's a very small part of the video.

I'm not Tracey-obsessed; she definitely pouts and the long hair is kind of distracting.  I don't think every woman must have a ""teeny tiny dancer body"".  I love to run and I will never give that up for dance cardio, no matter how much she and Gwynth yammer on about it.  Also, my left-sided IT band injury seems aggravated by her workout, and I started having pain in the same area on the right side. I'm hoping it will go away as the muscles strengthen over time because her workout seems to target the muscles that should be helping my injuy.  Regardless, I don't dislike her; she's totally tolerable as far as I'm concerned, and I cannot deny that her mat workout has given me fast and furious results.",1297900800,3,1148,4.224770642201835

My arms look better and I've lost 6 inches or so all over in 4 weeks. Weight loss is also improving due to dietary changes. 5 pounds so far.

This is a fun and different exercise routine and I feel that I am getting results already!  I love the idea of toning my ""accessory muscles"" - the muscles that do not usually get attention, but look great when toned.

It is almost an hour long, but I feel that it goes by quickly.  The first standing ab part is kind of funny, you are dancing your hips around - I am not sure when I will get that part right, but that part is only about 5 minutes long.  The arm toning section in my opinion, is the hardest!  By the time I got to the section where you hold the 3 lb weights (yes only 3 lbs!) I felt as though I couldn't do it, so I just held soup cans and will work my way up.  I am not overweight, just want to tone and I thought this was intense!

Because of the price, I read a ton of reviews, and I guess I failed to take seriously the ones saying that she did not provide adequate instruction (instead she seems to be quite enamored of her own dance skills). It's very hard to follow her moves because she rarely provides a cue, switching from one move to the next - and back - with nothing but her own dancing to indicate it.

I like how her routine will not build bulk and washboard abs, instead building a lean and strong frame that will age gracefully.

While Tracy doesn't give a lot of verbal instruction, this should not matter to anyone who has been exercising for a while and who is familiar with standard moves; I agree with another reviewer that the lack of ongoing instruction is desireable for those who can pick up the routines and moves quickly. What I don't like is the lack of simple technology on the DVD. I want to be able to move among the various routines for abs, arms, etc. without having to fast forward through. Right now I have the counter stops noted on a separate piece of paper and if I decide to do just the leg routines (3), for example, I have surf during my exercise session, which is a hassle.

All she would have to say is ""now to the left"" before the last rep.  The moves are fine.  Good old fashioned toning.  If you do this every day for 3 months and add cardio you will see results.  I guess after you watched it that many times you would catch on to her moves.  During the warm up there is almost no instruction or cuing.  I would be bending forward doing a stretch so I couldn't see the screen.  I would look up after 8 counts and realize she had moved on and I'd missed two stretches.  It was impossible to watch and follow.  How hard would it have been for her to say ""Now let's move to the right."",  ""Stand up and reach for the sky."" ?

I've worked out off and on since I was a teenager but thanks to hitting the big 30 in 2009 I now work out 5 days a week.  I've tried it all but I must say, I've noticed faster results with The Method than any other workout I've tried.  As a matter of fact, I've only used The Method since the end of November and by the end of December my husband was commenting on how 'pretty my butt looks in my jeans.'  The exercises really seem to target the areas we women tend to worry about; the dreaded bat wings, disappearing butt, etc.  This is a fantastic workout, however, I'm not sure if my results can be contributed to this workout alone or to the fact that I was already working out and in shape and this workout 'woke up and strenthened my accessory muscles'... kind of like the icing on the already exisiting cake.  Anyway, a BIG drawback, Tracy doesn't really give you much direction and it's difficult to guess just by watching whether or not your in proper form; this could cause injury.  For me, everything else is great!  The music, the exercises, the setting, and she's just so darn sweet and cute it's hard not to like her.",1293840000,5,1195,4.233480176211454

This workout is a toning workout so you will have to add your own cardio.  She prefers you do her cardio which is dance aerobics and to not do any other kind of cardio such as running, cycling,etc.  Running may bulk your muscles.

If you don't like taking a few weeks to learn new moves do not buy her dance cardio tapes.  I have her Dance cardio workout and I am still learning Track 1.  It may take me another week to master track one.  It's not hard you just have to take several weeks to learn the dance moves.

I do Yoga Booty Ballet from beach body.  I like the dance moves they offer and it's not as hard as her dance moves.  I recommend either walking, running or dancing to make up for having no cardio.

I don't have time to do the workout everyday so I recommend doing two days of cardio and 2 days of toning.  I think with time-the workouts will really tone your body.  You just have to be consistent.  I will keep you updated on my results.",1293321600,2,1110,4.069444444444445

I watched a couple clips of t.a.'s workouts on You Tube and thought it'd be worth buying one.  I can honestly say that after using it 3-4 times a week for a little over a month, I can absolutely see the results.  I pair it with running 2-3 times a week as well but can tell that my bod is tighter all over then it was before starting.

The leg and arm sections are great and can be done from anywhere without the video once you get it down which is nice.  I like the music...it goes well with the exercises.  Reps are not super consistent so I try to balance them as much as I can.  It's tough at first with so little instruction but I prefer it now that I know what I am doing.  I could do without the pouty lips she gives me, but maybe I'm just jealous. ;)  I do have to say that the standing ab section is a total joke.  I caught my husband watching me do it one day and I was mortified!  I have no idea what she is doing so I just kind of shake around.

Pros:
- I like the chair routine because it reminds me of barre.
- I like the arm routine because it kills my arms doing them.
- I like TA has unique moves
- lots of repetition, so you really feel the burn

Cons:
- As many mentioned, there should be more instructions especially the isolation in the ribcage and leg routines. Sometimes I don't want to look at the tv screen all the time and I listen for cues for example to switch legs or if she wants us to look down and I like to wait for the next cue but TA already moves on without a word.
- Not sure if I'm doing the leg routine correctly because of the minimal instructions.

My body hasn't looked this good in years.  I feel confident and comfortable in my skin.  I don't even weigh myself anymore!  A man actually told me that 'my butt was dangerous'!

Positive comments: I saw the most dramatic results in my arms.  I have also seen a difference in my legs and the area where my legs meet my glutes.  I feel overall tighter and smaller.  I have read some negative comments about Tracy's advice to use 3 pound weights or less.  I only have 5, 8, and 10 pound weights at my home so I use two soup cans for this dvd.  I personally could not use my regular heavier weights doing her arm series even if I wanted to.  I also think due to the type of moves she is doing, it is safer to be using lighter weights.  I enjoy the leg series the most.

Negatives: If you are someone who likes a lot of cues/direction this is not the video for you.  There are times in the warm up and cool down where you are bent over stretching (can't see the tv) and she doesn't cue you to straighten up.  But this is definitely not a reason to not get the DVD.

If I could break it down for you: Tracy Anderson dances around in a basement fitness room (looking totally, utterly bored and trying very hard to look sexy & sultry). She gives you little to no tips on form, no motivation, nothing! You just hear the music and see her dancing around. Good luck trying to copy her moves in your living room.  There are SO many other fitness DVD's out there that are better than this. To top it off, Gwyneth Paltrow speaks at the end, and talks about whoknowswhat.

3562553,2,B001F2HZHI,"I workout daily for 60-90 min. each day, rarely skipping a session.  I wanted to add some challenge to my workouts (was doing The Firm and 10 Min. Solution videos along with yoga and walking/jogging).  I purchased and completed this workout several times.  While some sections are challenging, some are just silly - specifically the standing abs.  I understand what she was going for here, but with absolutely no instruction, it seems cutesy and gimmicky.  The arms section was difficult and I did feel the burn, but didn't notice any difference in my arms.  My arms are already pretty skinny and don't need to be any more tiny.  What I need is toning to lift my triceps to eliminate the dreaded bat wings, and there isn't much of that here.  The arm exercises mostly focused on shoulders, so be careful, if you have any problems in that area, you will need to take it easy.

The leg sections were okay, but I prefer Tonique with Sylwia Weisenberg for these types of exercises.  With Tonique you will not only tone your glutes and thighs, well past the point of exhaustion,  but will sweat yourself silly burning lots of calories.  With Tracy's method, you do exhaust the muscles, but it isn't cardio based.  I know, I know...this is a mat workout.  But if you have a limited amount of time to get in cardio and toning work, then I would recommend Tonique instead.  You will get both in spades, I assure you.

I am not sold on Tracy Anderson's ""method"".  First of all, I do not agree with the whole ""don't lift more than 3 lbs."" philosophy.  I consistently lift more than that with other workouts, and I have the skinniest arms you've ever seen.  It has more to do with your genetic makeup than with the amount of weight you lift.  I would have to lift an extreme amount of weight to ""bulk up"", where others lift less and get ""bulky"".  That ""bulk"" burns a ton of calories, so if you want to be able to eat more than 600-700 calories a day (that Tracy recommends in her book and website), then I suggest you ""bulk up"" and create a calorie burning machine rather than a weak upper body.  Firm, muscular arms also make you look more proportioned, especially if you have a more pear shaped figure.

I think if Tracy provided more detailed instruction and more information about these ""accessory muscles"" (where are they specifically, what are they called, which exercises correspond to which accessory muscles, etc), did some cueing, showed more emotion rather than borderline boredom, and displayed more athleticism, then maybe I could get on-board with the ""method"".

3562557,5,B001F2HZHI,"First of all - I love this program and it gets results.  Second, while I understand everyone's frustration with the shortcomings of Tracy's video, it honestly is just a bunch of whining.  This video is incredible - it has a revolutionary approach to toning and weight loss, and if you can't keep up with it, then watch it over again (and maybe again and again - frankly if you're not very ""quick"" you may have trouble understanding everything the first time).

Tracy doesn't give a whole lot of guidance but I didn't find that frustrating at all - I just went with it.  People expect that if they put a DVD in they'll magically lose 5 pounds without having to do anything.  Come on!  The woman is not a genie. She tells you straight up - this is not going to be easy and you will have to commit 5-6 days a week.  Oh, and if you don't understand everything the first time, then watch it again.  If you can't commit to that, then don't buy the DVD.  End of story.  If you really want results and you want those lean, toned muscles, then just keep doing the video and quit complaining.  Becoming a healthy, fit person is hard work, especially if you want to do it in Tracy's way.  I do not think she is a fraud at all.  She's incredibly talented and has provided the material to enable others.  If you don't know what to do with it, well that's your own problem.

I give this video 5 stars - if you're willing to put in the time, effort, and drive, then you will see results with this program.  I've gone from a size 6 to a size 2 on it (I also do her dance cardio which I used to be terrible at).

3562559,5,B001F2HZHI,"Disclaimer: I know how much Tracy despises running, and despite my love and adoration for her mat workouts I just can't buy into her cardio dance gospel (and don't even get me started on those incredibly silly treadmill workouts.) I hope my perspective and results will encourage some of my runner sisters to ignore the cardio half of Tracy's method and still reap the reward of her really innovative toning moves.

As a runner (I'm no marathoner and I couldn't care less about PRs, but I'll do the occasional half and I live for trail running), I'm constantly trying to find non-cardio workouts that are both challenging and relaxing. I love running because it's both incredibly difficult and extremely centering, and I really try to look for that balance in other forms of exercise. The slow pace of yoga and pilates tends to frustrate me, and the HYPER ACTION attitude you find in body sculpting classes kind of scares me.

Tracy Anderson's Mat Workout, however, is absolutely perfect for me. My cardio habit had left me a little noodly at best and downright skinnyfat at worst. Though lean, I completely lacked muscle definition. I've been doing this workout alternating with her webisodes (I'm not sure you can purchase them anymore now that her Perfect Design series is out) 5 days a week for the past six weeks, and the results have been absolutely incredible.

Upper body: The arms series are amazing! My arms have definition for the first time in my life, and nothing beats extending your arm and seeing the tricep pop! I know Tracy gets a lot of flack for telling women to never go above 3 lb weights, but I simply can't imagine doing her arms series with a heavier weight. Plus, it's fairly common knowledge that heavy weights and low reps make bulk, whereas light weights and high reps whittle... and no one does high reps quite like Tracy.

Abs/core: I have to admit, I really didn't get the standing abs series at first. The mat work was great, but I just kind of felt like a gangly prepubescent boy trying to do the standing abs sequence. However, after about 3 weeks of wiggling my way through, the mind-body connection involved in the standing abs sequence finally clicked. It's really hard to explain how it works, but all I can tell you is that you'll get it if you do it enough. The workout hasn't made me ""ripped"" by any means, but my entire midsection has definitely gotten smaller. All of my jeans now gap at the waist and I had to invest in several new pairs of lululemon speed shorts since my old ones were beginning to fall south during my runs.

Legs: My legs were already very lean from running, but I found that this workout had some interesting effects on them. The ballet barre style moves she does don't seem particularly difficult at the outset, but they come back to haunt you the next day. I was SORE. My legs haven't changed in size according to the measuring tape, but they look sleeker and more feminine. My quads seem a lot less boxy and my inner calves now nip in right below the knee. These are small, small changes, but together they make for a different (and very welcome) look for my legs.

Butt: Again, my butt was effected quite like my legs. Formerly square, flat, and kind of squishy (sorry for the overshare), it is now round, firm, and just the right amount of juicy. I got a booty-related catcall for the first time EVER last week, and I couldn't be happier!

Overall, I'm incredibly happy I took the plunge to try out the Tracy Anderson Method. While I didn't follow the gospel of Tracy to a t, I found that I was able to tailor it to my needs and interests and maximize my results.

Good luck!",1282521600,136,3646,4.547256097560975

3562561,5,B001F2HZHI,"I gave this dvd a full 2 months before I wrote this review. I am a 44 year old runner who was looking for something in addition to my running. I have spent countless dollars on videos only to find that I would use them for 2 weeks and then never use them again. I came across the Tracy Anderson Mat Method and after researching it for 2 weeks before I purchased it, I decided to give her a try.  I have to say... this is the MOST unique exercise video I have ever seen. I have seen the most dramatic transformation in my body that running alone could never address. The arm portion of this video has sculpted my arms beyond my expectations. You would think 3 pound weights wouldn't be enough but let me tell you, it is VERY challenging and produces dramatic results. When I first purchased this video, I did it 4 to 5 times a week. Along with running, it became a bit overwhelming so now I mix it up and do just the arm portion for one day and the leg routine for another day and the entire video when I feel like it. I have lost inches everywhere without dieting, which I have NEVER been able to do.

The ONLY cons I would say about this DVD is that I wish you could customize your workout. I read some reviews that you can't fast forward to certain exercises but I have found a way around this.. I use Media Player on my laptop and what I have found is when I stop the video at a certain point, I can start at that point the next day and all i have to do is rewind it to the portion that I want to do that day. It works! Also, she seems to lose count of the reps during the routine but this is no big deal. Just make sure the next time you do the dvd, start with the opposite side to balance things out! Another thing is that Tracy does not address any back strengthening exercises so after my workout, I incorporate my own for several minutes and that seems to do the trick.

If you are hesitant about trying this video, I encourage you to try it. I love the background music and the fact that she doesn't talk much. I just ordered the post pregnancy work out because I hear that it's challenging as well. Tracy's method is very unique and although I have read that her technique can cause injury, I have not come across that.

3562563,5,B001F2HZHI,"Ok, here goes. I've really been struggling to find the right exercise after I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and hypoadrenia. I've tried getting my stamina up with aerobics, lifting weights, spinning, pilates and yoga (the latter I've done for 20 years), and all these methods have either triggered tendonitis, inflammation in muscles or worn me down rather than built me up. I was a dancer when I was younger and am now approaching the end of my thirties, needless to say, when you've been a dancer (classic or contemporary) you need a little more to get you into shape than e.g. aerobics. So, even though I was in VERY miserable shape when I started Tracy's dvd's, and I was pretty sure I was going downhill again like I did with all other exercise programs.. Instead I started getting that great feeling that you get after a really good danceprep workout back!! I had to start out very slow because of my thyroid+adrenal conditions, but I've managed to pace myself and am now breezing through this dvd that in the beginning seemed energetically challenging to me. I think this is a very gentle and THANKFULLY 'unaerobic like' dvd. The routine is just right for beginners and ok explained. I have to admit a little more cueing when you're not able to look at the screen would be good and for that I deduct one star. These exercises are beyond GREAT and will certainly give you that beautiful dancers body and strength if you allow it to be a part of your daily routine. I also loved the wooden look and warm lighting in the studio.

3562565,2,B001F2HZHI,"I have heard great things about Tracy Anderson through the Media because of her link to Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow. At first, i thought her approach to fitness is the right fit for me as I myself danced when I was younger (did ballet) and my fitness goal is to look lean and sexy, not bulky and ultra-muscular.

Prior to purchasing this DVD, I went on the Insanity workout by Shaun T and was impressed that I lost 5-8 lbs (i don't own a scale so I can't confirm exact numbers but I can confirm that my clothes are LOOSE!). I then decided to buy Tracy's Mat DVD to help firm up my troubled areas.

Prior to doing the exercises, I watched the entire DVD so I will have an idea and a feel for it. Tried it last night and I must say that I am experiencing some ""sciatic pain"" in my buttocks. I cannot tell whether the pain was part of the usual soreness you get from exercising the first time or I must've done an exercise incorrectly. Regardless, I was slightly disappointed with this DVD, I thought $30 was TOO MUCH for this (I can get better videos at Walmart for a cheaper price), and the workouts are NOT that impressive. Frankly, I don't know what the fuss was about, Gwyneth and Madonna and why are we RAVING so much about Tracy Anderson's method.

However, I probably would still do the arm exercises as I too, would not want bulky arms, but that's pretty much about it. I have no interest in her leg workouts, and her ab workouts are a bit boring. Tracy could also use some personality and be better when giving instructions - you may get a little lost if you were not focused on the TV.

Overall, I would not recommend this video - for $30, not really worth it. I'd rather do Pilates or the New York City Ballet exercise!",1280793600,3,1728,4.259146341463414
3562566,4,B001F2HZHI,This dvd is worth the money if you are already fit and want to break up your normal work out routine. You need to be very warmed up beforehand or you will surely injure yourself. Some of her moves are awkward and she doesn't really count off sets for you. You pretty much need to just follow along and eventually memorize her moves. The positive part of this dvd is that you will be sore in places you are not used to and will shock your underused muscles and encourage muscle confusion. I would buy it if you are sick of the treadmill and squats and want to try something new.,1279584000,,577,4.207207207207207

The only problem was that she didn't give very much direction. She kind of went through certain sequences with changes without letting you know. It was annoying for the first few tries.

I am sore after I do the video, so that means something. I did find myself a bit confused at times. It seems like she is moving around randomly and losing count in some parts. I found myself wondering if she was filling up time with some body movements, or if it was truly scripted.

Additionally, the dvd quality is poor. There is no option to skip through sections. You have to watch the whole work out, or fast fwd/rewind the ""old fashioned"" way.",1277942400,,555,4.431372549019608
3562583,5,B001F2HZHI,"You have the ability to transform your body. If you engage in this ""mat"" video at least 4 times a week you will experience change you never thought possible. You can decrease your size by at least one to two sizes, as clothes will fit you better following consistent dedication to the mat video. In addition to the mat video and a healthy well-balanced diet, complete 3 to 4 cardio sessions weekly (lasting 30-60 minutes)and you will be amazed with the results. You can have the sexy, tight body you always have wanted!

Caution: Doing the leg exercises put pressure on my lower back, and the warm up and cool down did little to prevent lower back tightness. I found a good balance by engaging in the following:
1. Prior to engaging in the mat workout, I Utilized the approximately 18 warm-up in the kundalini yoga video found on amazon.com, from Ana Brett, the Warrior Workout:
http://www.amazon.com/Warrior-Workout-Kundalini-Ana-Brett/dp/B0006VY6JO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1277942859&sr=8-1 (note: warm-up ends when the ""frog legs"" exercise starts)
2. Engaging in the following yoga stretches prior and post Tracy Anderson's mat ""leg exercises"" (holding each stretch for at least 6-8 deep inhalation/exhalations):
A: cat/cow
B: a low lunge that will stretch your psios muscle (which if not properly aligned can result in lower back pain): adopt a lunging position with one knee forward, forming a 90 degree angle, if possible, between the hip and the calf. Extend the other leg behind you, kneeling slightly, and lower yourself slowly into the stretch, which you will feel in the front of the hip. Keep your spine perfectly straight while performing this stretch, and do not allow the knee of your forward leg to overhang your toes.
C: Down Dog
D: Fist Forward Bend: Come to stand, feet hip-distance apart. Bend your knees, and release your torso over the legs until your belly touches your thighs. Make fists and place them in the opposite elbow creases. Relax your back, neck and head, and squeeze fists actively. (Fits and bent elbows together are a central nervous system trigger that causes your back muscles to open. You'll feel it after just a few breaths!)
3. Follow the mat workout with at least 30 minutes of any Ana Brett kundalini yoga video and you can kiss any lower back pain away! Current favorites are Ana Bett's recent kundalini yoga videos the ""transformer"" and ""solar power"". Note: Ana's ""warrior"" video can be utilized as 60 minutes of cardio, as it is a superior cardio yoga video. I have also found success in engaging in 30-60 minutes of dance cardio (I live in Chicago and attend Flirty Girl Fitness Cardio dance classes).
Tracy is a true genius for how each woman can achieve her own feminine ideal shape...invest your energy here wisely and you will be delighted with the results...combine her mat workout with Ana Brett's Kundalini Yoga videos sold on Amazon and you have a winning combination!",1277856000,2,2929,5.002049180327869

It has a weirdly sensuous vibe (my husband calls it the pole-dancing video) and is hard to follow at first.  It isn't cued all that well, and I wasn't always sure that I was doing it right. (especially the standing abs section!)  It definitely takes some getting used to.  I highly recommend doing the routine in front of a large mirror, so that you can watch what you're doing and make adjustments. That helped me a lot! I liked this more and more each time I did the routine and now it is my favorite.  After just a few weeks I can definitely tell a difference in my body.  Even more importantly, I really enjoy it and look forward to doing it!  I am doing it 4-5 times a week and love the way it makes me feel.",1277683200,,834,4.048780487804878

I plan to do it every day for the next month and see what I can achieve. I am a teacher so it is perfect timing to be able to work on fitness. A positive side effect is that the chronic pain I have suffered from, especially at night is 90% improved. I feel so much better. Most of my pain was in my shoulders and hips. This video emphasizes stretching while you do the exercises and I credit that for helping as much as it has. I have done other forms of exercise (Jazzercise, gym, walking) but this is the only one that has helped with, rather than made worse, the pain issues.

I agree with others that a few more modifications could be suggested. I have come up with a few modifications of my own that are helping to tailor the exercises to my limitations. For example, the floor leg work seems to wrench my lower back. Instead of lying on the ground for some of them, I get up on all fours and try to target the same muscle group.

I like the music and appreciate her understated style. I can't stand ""rah rah"" chattering while I am trying to concentrate. I also feel like the way to figure out the exercises is to watch. If she talked too much, it would detract from concentrating on the exercises after the first few times.

I highly recommend this video!

3562591,4,B001F2HZHI,I have really enjoyed the Tracy Anderson Method Mat Workout DVD and I'm on my fourth week of the workout. Readers must be warned this is not a normal workout and if your not willing to pay close attention then this is not the DVD for you. If your okay with little verbal instruction and lots of repititions than you'll understand the movements after your second or third run. I purchased this DVD because I wanted to tone. I didn't buy it for weight loss. If weight loss is your goal than I would probably recommend some form of cardio to supplement this DVD. In four weeks I am noticing the toning of my arms more than any other workout I've done in the past. I do the workout five times a week and I know the more I continue the movements the more I will see results.  It's a tough workout but at least the music is great!,1275955200,,824,4.182389937106918

My legs look thinner, my tummy is slimming, and my arms are looking more toned!  The workout in all takes about 1 hour and I already had a mat, 2 lb weights, and dining room chair.  For me, its not enough to just do this dvd.  I definitely have to mix in cardio to see the overall results I want and Tracy actually recommends this as well.  It is true that directions as to 'what move is coming next' is lacking, but once you do it a few times you pretty much know what to expect and I kinda like that she leaves it up to you to 'play' with the moves, especially the standing abs workout......very fun!  Music is good and so is the pace.  I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to try something different and tone!",1275436800,2,957,4.10752688172043
3562593,5,B001F2HZHI,"Firstly, let me put my profile under perspective, so you can decide how to consider this review. I'm 32 yo, 5 ft 7.7 inches, 133.82 pounds. I'm pear-shaped and do have an excess of 4-6 pounds of fat on my thighs/legs. I use to be a fitness trainer back in my early twenties and even travelled all the way from Switzerland to California to follow Karen Voight's classes. I eventually gave up teaching aerobic and body sculpt classes when I turned 21 and went travelling. I would still hit the gym from time to time but never recovered the enthusiasm to keep up for more than 3 months. I'm skilled enough to understand how to work out with different types of exercises, but I'm out of shape. My whole body muscles are atrophied.

It's a shame to be in my thirties and already stiff and wimpy like an oldie, with loose skin on my thighs. So after several hesitations I checked out the best workout's reviews on Amazon.com (thanks to everyone, you've been really useful), I went for the controversial Tracy Anderson's method. I must say that I'm actually enjoying this total body toning very much. Much to my surprise, it's pleasant and efficient, without being too challenging. Now ok, it doesn't deserve an unreserved praise. First it's not a miraculous method; only a creative and fun method and I'll probably add other types of exercises to my routine as well. Plus there is a lack of cueing and little instructions; in a word it has some faults. I'm not going through them all as other reviewers have already listed and commented them. I'll only add my humble opinion: even though it's not perfect, you can still make it works for you. From beginner up to intermediate level, it's great. On the long term use, you won't even care for the faults; they'll not prevent you from efficiently enjoying the workout. The rest is up to your eagerness and devotion. But if you are reluctant to this type of exercising, albeit its very accessible workability, it might just not be for you. For advanced people, if you are looking for a challenge, skip this one, but if you just need new routine and you are ready and able to move full force, it might work. The fact that she's creative, motivated, kind and attractive makes it great to train with her. This DVD does, from far, not become useless because of its faults and I don't even feel I must penalize her with a lower rate, like if the whole thing was a trap for fool. Either you add it to your routine for a change, or you practice as your main training with a little bit of cardio, but it's definitely worthwhile.  She made barre and core exercising popular.

Muscle fibers and the whole muscle are not capable of building up by themselves without receiving a force from outside. It can be gravity, motion, the strength of antagonist muscles, the force provided by weights or/and even from a person. In this workout you get a great range of motions for your legs, abs, arms and back, using your trunk muscles while performing flexions and rotations. It's your own weight against gravity and light weights that challenge muscles to build up. This method prevents you from getting bulky muscles, it's fair enough and exactly what I wanted. I agree with what she says about it on the video. Then she uses a system of rotation that includes all muscles to work out and not only the major muscles. I did get interesting results! In fact, yearning to move again, my body has quickly gained muscles and showed great promise like never before with traditional body sculpting and other BODYPUMP(tm) routines.

I've owed this DVD for 4 weeks; I've been doing it six times a week and I noticed a gradual progression. It's really like my body was starving for this ""lengthening while toning"" types of motions. It definitely had an awakening effect on my muscular frame. My body posture is already looking better and I'm feeling great after only four weeks. I guess I'll continue to explore core/barre exercising, plus I'll add some basic circuit training, cardio, Pilates and yoga for variations and flexibility (I believe you must vary your routine to avoid plateau and injury).

Back on the first day, I couldn't even follow the whole routine. Four weeks later I'm completely in of tune with it. Give it a chance too. Also, I found it hard to follow the arms sections because it goes harsh on the deltoids. As being the prime mover of arm abduction it'll stand all the effort on its own. Before you develop your arm's muscles harmoniously in order to spread out the force along them, it'll take a little time. So my deltoids were burning, my joints were tense and I didn't even feel the other muscles working while doing the motions. Anyway, after four weeks, plus lots of sweats and bird names, I achieved to follow the whole routine (and stop sweating by the way). The arms section is still hard but I manage to spread out the effort. It's great to notice you're increasing your muscular definition, it's encouraging. My thighs haven't shrunk yet and no weight loss neither, but more toning and a better body posture. For what I consider to be a daily effort equally intense than the usual term ""reasonable efforts"", it's a lot and I am happy with it. It has motivated me again. I will consider buying other workouts from Tracy.",1275350400,7,5267,4.628877005347594
3562594,5,B001F2HZHI,"I am very happy with this purchase. The video itself is aesthetically pleasing in many ways. Nice work-out space, great music, beautiful movements, and I think Tracy looks great. I don't agree with many of the criticisms about her hair or alleged 'pouting'. Of course you are going to want to look good when you are filming a video presenting your work. I don't see anything wrong with that and think the critics here are just being catty.

I also think the criticisms about her moves/cues being difficult to follow are exaggerated. They are challenging moves indeed, but if you are a person who is used to following videos or classes, I can't see how this is SO hard. They do film different angles, and in instances where you can't see her leg, she does give specific instruction about how you should be lifting it or how high your knee should be, etc. I never had any problem following her cues. And I prefer her minimalist approach to instructing. I do not need someone cueing every rep, but maybe a beginner would become a bit more distressed at the lack of hand-holding. I found Tracy's relaxed tone and style very refreshing.

I won't be doing these DVD's exclusively as Tracy wants, but I think they are a great addition to my routine and I am going to splurge on the 3 DVD box set for sure. She leaves me wanting more of these unique and really lovely flowing movements, which create a surprising amount of burn! Especially the arm exercises.

Separate from my opinion about the video itself, I realize that her statements about 'bulking' and the 3 lb max weight rule have stirred a lot of uproar in the fitness community. I don't find it to be true FOR ME that heavy lifting has created bulk, if anything, it has made me firmer and tauter. But everyone's bodies have a different reaction, and some are just after a certain look.

The workout is challenging, but not impossible. I love the butt/thigh portion and the arm portion is amazing! I've only done it once and I can feel this morning that my abs, arms and thighs were truly engaged.

Tracy Anderson's goal is to give you a lean dancer's body without the super muscular look and I really appreciate this. She explains why she does what she does and it makes complete sense to me. I am feeling more toned and the workout is not boring. I actually look forward to my workout time with Tracy. You don't need to purchase any special equipment and I really like this, too.

3562603,3,B001F2HZHI,"I am 5'3"", 34 years old, and 145 lbs. I'm a short-distance runner (3 miles a day, 5 days a week) and have been running for about 10 months. I noticed that my glutes, hips and thighs were LARGER than they used to be, despite losing 3% body fat!

I started doing some research and realized that the repetitive nature of running has created bulk, when I wanted lean, strong muscles. After checking out a number of exercise programs, I looked into the Tracy Anderson Method.

Despite being in relatively decent shape, the Mat workout kicked my butt! There is sound reasoning behind the idea of exhausting your major muscle groups before engaging your accessory muscles, and that a large number of repetitions will change your muscles. I noticed that this workout did make a difference in my strength. I've noticed some better definition in my arms and abs.

Cons: Cues and direction are mostly non-existent. She rarely (if ever) calls out direction, so you have to be watching instead of concentrating on the exercise. (I know that she was a dancer, and you'd think she'd grasp the idea of giving better cues.) If you understand the fundamentals of Pilates, then you will know the proper positioning for some of the positions. The camera is no help, shooting mainly from the front, with a few side angles thrown in. It's also difficult to see some of the positions because her hair is in the way. If you aren't very, very careful, you could injure yourself by performing some of the exercises improperly. During one segment, she encourages you to 'arch your back' while extending your leg behind you... unless you are a professional dancer, and are in great shape, that is NOT a wise thing to do.

The idea of being able to 'fundamentally change your muscle structure' is garbage. Despite Tracy Anderson's claims, no one can fully overcome their genetic makeup; not every woman is able to achieve a dancer's build with 'teeny-tiny' arms.

I've given this three stars because I did get a good workout. This is the first non-impact exercise that has caused me to sweat!

3562604,1,B001F2HZHI,I'm a physical therapist and an exercise enthusiast.  The method probably is effective if you have Tracy Anderson with you in the room otherwise it is poorly filmed(not shot from correct angles) and poorly directed.  The mat ab work has the potential for neck and back strain.  There are very few adaptations.  Tracy needs to offer more instuction.  It seems more like a performance than a teaching tool.,1273622400,4,404,4.882352941176471
3562605,5,B001F2HZHI,"While the hype around Tracy Anderson is controversial and her style unconventional this Mat workout is GREAT. I had no idea what to expect when ordering this but have found myself looking forward to doing this workout most evenings. The standing arm section is crazy challenging yet fun and very effective. She follows this up with a arm exercises using light weights which is my favorite part of the DVD. She has a dance-like style and fluent motions through each exercise. Her music selection is enjoyable, modern and not overbearing. Some have commented on her lack of prompting throughout the workout, but I find this a plus especially if you follow her advice and repeat the workout 4-5 times a week. Who wants to hear the same running commentary every day? After following along once or twice you can easily remember the order of each exercise no prompts necessary.",1273536000,3,871,4.852348993288591

I have tried to stay in shape, jogging, lifting lighter weights and using other programs. Tracy's routine is the best ever.

T-Tapp dvds by Teresa Tapp have the best leg series. hang in there!",1273363200,2,379,4.352112676056338

Don't try and do it like Tracy right off- she has been doing it for a long time.  Do what you can, in proper form!  Don't worry, the more you do it, the more you will be able to do.  Get into the music and feel your body- there is a reason she doesn't talk much- make your own connection and listen to your body!

I have had such spectacular results, I wish I could post a before and after!  When I first started I called her every bad name in the book- but I stuck with it and changed my body, my life!

I'm 48 years old and have those trouble spots that Tracy talks about and hope that with some time I will notice some good changes.  I gave this product a 4 only because it is sometimes hard to follow - you have to keep your eyes on what she is doing - She doesn't talk a lot and I like that part - the music is not annoying and somewhat soothing.  This is a full body workout and I will continue to use this dvd because I feel like it is making me stronger and with good eating habits making me healthier:),1272758400,,675,3.8345323741007196
3562610,5,B001F2HZHI,"First of all let me start by saying I have NEVER written a review for anything in my life, however I was so impressed by the results of this workout I had to share my point. I have  been running for over a year & usually run 3-5 miles 5 days a week. I was beginning to get frustrated because despite all my running I wasn't seeing changes & was continuing to look ""bulky"" especially in the thighs. I ordered Tracy's workout & began seeing huge changes immeadiately in my arms & abs. After just 3 weeks of 4 days a week & not changing my diet at all my butt started to lift & my thighs began getting tighter. I am amazed at the quick results to this video. I also ordered the dance cardio & after a month just couldn't get the moves down. So I continue to run 3-4 days a week & do T.A mat 4 days. After 2 months it just keeps improving & the results motivate me to stay consistant. I have to say I have tried the other Sequences & the original mat seems to produce the best results. The music can get a little annoying but I just put on my ipod & mute it. The only complaint I have is during the arm section she is absolutely not consisitant with the reps on both sides so watch out for that. Otherwise, this is THE best most efficient workout video I have ever tried.",1272326400,13,1267,4.027777777777778

3562612,4,B001F2HZHI,I love this video! I love the results it gives me! While you are doing it you may want to cry. Tracy has you do a lot of reps and really pushes you! You feel a burn like no other because your accessory muscles are being used & that is unique to her method. I like her philosophy of not bulking a woman up. After doing it once I felt the pain the next day...but I didn't regret it. I feel like I have an internal corset now that pulls my abs in and makes me walk taller. It really delivers a long and lean dancer physique...but you have to commit to doing it 5x a week. My only complaints about the video is the music (not my personal taste at all for excersize) and the fact she has her hair glammed out for the video is stupid and unrealistic. I suggest to anyone to pull it up in a pony tail because you will SWEAT! Overall this video will work for anyone if they stick to it!,1272067200,,878,3.938202247191011
3562613,5,B001F2HZHI,I love this workout!  Tracy really changed how I work out and changed how my body looks.  I am a thick black chick and Tracy leans me out and not bulks me up.  I have tons of workout dvds and only Tracy & Jullian Micheals keep me motivated.,1271894400,,240,3.9583333333333335
3562614,5,B001F2HZHI,"At first I did not think much about the workout, but after couple of weeks of doing it everyday, my god - my arms and legs are starting to look awesome.  I did not get sore and it did not burn as much as I was expecting based on all of the reviews so I was thinking it was not going to be that effective.  Boy - was I wrong!  I don't know if it is the number of repetition, sequencing or what but it really works - there really is a Method.  My husband, who generally tends to be oblivious to these things, even commented on how ""sleek and feminine"" I have been looking.  I am so glad Tracy Anderson rolled out this DVD and I found it.",1271462400,9,635,3.891472868217054
3562615,5,B001F2HZHI,"I am 27 years old and pregnant (18 weeks) with my third baby. I used to be a dancer as a child and teenager but since having my first baby 7 years ago I have not worked out regularly AT ALL. I have done a pilates class here and a yoga video there but nothing consistent in the least. I consider myself pretty out of shape (out of breath after climbing 1-2 flights of stairs) and have the physical evidence as well (muffin top, thicker thighs, etc).  After a recent leg injury I had a wake up call that working out and taking care of myself was no longer optional (not that it ever was) so have been searching for something I can do while pregnant and after but that won't hurt my knees or back (my weak areas).

 This DVD came highly, highly recommended by my friend, the workout video guru, as something she has done for a long time even throughout most of her recent pregnancy. She has purchased countless videos and says this is one of the best. So I bought it (even though it's double most other videos) 98% convinced I wouldn't be able to keep up or do it.

I just finished my first time through and it was AWESOME!! Each section is incredibly thorough but I never felt exhausted or burnt out, out of breath, dizzy, etc. The target areas were definitely working and often burning and I definitely had to take quick breaks (shhh don't tell) but what I love about Tracy is that she moves along quickly. You are almost never sticking with one move for very long so I wasn't bored and her history of ballet and dance influences her moves so I felt graceful and feminine while toning and getting my butt kicked! The moves she does are so unique! I have taken many dance and exercise classes as a teen and never have I done a lot of what she came up with. It truly is unique.

I can definitely see doing this video for a long time. I can't wait to see the results.",1271462400,2,1863,4.22191011235955
3562616,5,B001F2HZHI,"I'm totally loving this DVD!  I was skeptical, as others were, because I don't do that *celebrity* thing.  And I don't do the *nothing over 3 lbs* thing, either.  I seriously have 20 and 25 lb weights in my arsenal, and I'm not afraid to use them.  But I thought, eh, what the heck, I'll give it a try.  I. Was. Wrong.  I agree that Tracy acts a bit strange in here.....a bit of a mix between coy and embarrassed, both of which are a bit weird in an exercise video.  However, I find her very likable, and not annoying in the least.  I love that she doesn't narrate a lot.  I mean, seriously, after you do the thing five times, you know it, so who needs a lot of chatter.  The music is very Madonna-ish, as someone else said.  Not my usual choice in music, but I rather like it here.  The workout is quite effective, as in I feel it the next day.  But not in the ""Oh my God, where's the ibuprofen!"" sort of way, more in an ""awareness"" type of way, if that makes sense.  I just feel spots/areas that I haven't in a long time (or ever, maybe).  I've been alternating this with her post-pregnancy workout for about 4 weeks now, 4-6 times a week, and I'm already seeing definition in spots I haven't ever before.  Esp my arms!  The arm workout in this is KILLER.  More of a workout than I got from those 20-25 lb suckers I was using, no lie.  And easy on the joints, to boot.  Definitely try this workout, you'll be hooked.",1271116800,13,1418,4.143382352941177
3562617,4,B001F2HZHI,"If you can get past Tracy's need to pout her lips and the odd tendency to literally break out into club dancing mid workout, you will love the results!  It is a great workout, that is not easy.  I do see myself being able to do the DVD everyday, eventhough afterwards I am beat.  It seems like my muscles don't stay sore for long and I am already seeing tightness in my stomach and arms after only 5 days.  I think though, after realizing I like this type of workout, you may like the Pure Barre method and similar ballet type workouts.  I think I am going to try some of those out.  The one bad thing about the DVD production wise is that you can't start the DVD on Abs or Legs or Arms you have to sit through and do the entire series.

It's like working out WITH someone to me.",1270166400,,324,4.111111111111111
3562620,4,B001F2HZHI,"Let me start by saying I have used the following workout DVDs: Jari Love (I have four), Jackie Warner (her very first DVD through her Bravo show) and Jillian Michaels (NMTZ and BFBM).  I bought Boost Fat Burn Metabolism with the MAT DVD.  I was primarily a cardio-girl until I realized although I was getting smaller I was not getting more toned.  I needed to incorporate strength-training/toning exercises and it's been an uphill battle trying not to go into auto-pilot and  go straight to a cardio workout(I love running!)

After reading the reviews, I decided to do BFBM first, since I'm already familiar with JM (and yes, it was more of a cardio-based workout).  I tried MAT last week and have used it twice before writing this review.  Although I can't say what results I've seen (although I do feel peculiarly more taut having done the workout) I can tell you this is for intermediate/advanced exercisers.  And even though I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser, I can also tell you this is one butt-busting workout.  Not in a sweat-your-face-off kind of way -- but you still find yourself exerting effort and energy to 1) keep up and 2) maintain form.  Which is why I say ""patience and focus required!""

Anderson does not narrate the entire workout. Which could be frustrating if you like lots of instruction. I always keep the instruction on when I play DVDs with that option, but with MAT, I figured, ""why not just go with the flow?""  It's more of a dancer-ish workout routine, and I suppose dancers are just used to watching moves and executing them as they follow along.  This is just like that.  But it's good, because you'll be able to track your progress and improvement.  You'll eventually learn the routine, that's the just the nature of something you intend to repeat over and over again.  I'm taking advantage of not knowing it all -- because just that damn arm workout alone (the standing workout, there are two, with and without weights), IS A PAIN. And pain in the traditional ""no pain no gain"" sort of way.  But again, you've got something to base your progress on.

I was definitely apprehensive by the reviews I've read and the Oprah episdoe with Gwyneth. I also received a 10 min excerpt from the TA website -- scary! But now I'm looking forward to buying Beginner's Dance and the regular Dance workout. I want my body fabulous! As for all the editorializing about her ""don't use more than 3lb weights."" It's how designed this workout, I won't let her rule dictate how I conduct my other workouts (because quite honestly, I needed to upgrade to 5lbs for NMTZ).

Listening to some music today, I found myself doing some of TA's moves as I danced along.  Crazy! But then again, a few of the moves you do, you'll remember Madonna doing them in one of her videos.  It's that kind of workout.  And how you can *not* do something like that?

Oh, and why did I give it only 4 stars?  It wasn't as strenuous as I originally thought, and I could actually do the entire workout straight through on the first-go.  Whether it gives me a taut Tracy Anderson-ish body is what will push it over to 5.",1269907200,,3124,4.615942028985507
3562621,5,B001F2HZHI,"Okay, there has been so much said on this page that I will skip the breakdowns of the workouts but WILL say this workout rocks! Set your feelings about Tracy aside if you have negative ones, and give this workout a chance! It is incredible for the female physique, creates long lean lines and has an arm section that is KILLER and will change your arms FOREVER. Just do it :) By the way, the music is AWESOME!",1269475200,,409,4.256410256410256
3562622,4,B001F2HZHI,"After researching TA on the internet, I was tempted to snub the DVD due to some negative comments about her personal life and her style of exercise. Even though everything she said about bulking vs. lean muscle had secretly been voiced in my own head all these years. So, I finally succumbed, put aside the negative speculation, and bought it myself. I'll break down what I believe on the three body areas: 1) the legs 2) the stomach 3) the arms

1) The legs. The rotations on the leg mat routine shows some similarities with the very first Firm tape with Susan Harris. The standing leg section is similar to Cindy Crawford tapes as well as moves from a Kathy Smith tape.

2) The stomach. The standing stomach section, particularly the rib isolation part, can be experienced through a lot of belly dance classes and tapes. Rib isolation and inner stomach control are very common components to belly dancing. The mat stomach routine was not as difficult as I had imagined it would be.

And finally:

3) The arms: This is the most anticipated section for me. I tend to easily bulk on my arms. These exercises did burn my arms, and I couldn't keep my arms up the entire time. But, I tried. And I do think doing no/light weights for high reps vs. heavy weights for low reps is the way to create a sleeker look on your arms. Again, I think you can find these arm movements in some other tapes. And I know TA discourages Yoga, but I have to say...some hand balancing yoga exercises can really tone your arms in a lean way. I agree that some yoga poses, when done constantly (Warrior poses) can bulk up hamstring muscles. But, SOME Iyengar asanas are not bulk building. And I must include this, in case anyone is interested. Gaurmukh Khalsa does some similar movememnts with her arms in her Kundalini Yoga. Not the EXACT Same, but very similar. Gaurmukh uses quick, short ranges of movement for about two minutes to create tension in the arms. She also uses the same concept of doing the same move over and over again until your arms start burning. (up and down and up and down and up down) Basic moves that seem rudimentary but are the age old that never fail=)

That being said, I still think this DVD is worth the purchase since it contains all the above qualities in one DVD. It's efficient and complete.",1269475200,5,2301,4.4952153110047846
3562623,5,B001F2HZHI,"I thought I would give Tracy Anderson's mat workout a try. I was a little discouraged when she said you had to do the video four to six times a week, every week, to see results. But I thought I would try. After two weeks, I was surprised to see actual results. The hanging stuff under the arms is firming up and my legs look great. People ask if I have lost weight. She believes it is better not to bulk up and I agree. I am so happy with the workout that I have ordered her dance video. The music is also great, very mellow and works with the exercises.",1269216000,2,554,4.0
3562624,5,B001F2HZHI,"I first found out about Tracy from a web article on the Oprah show she did in 2008 and started her intense diet and cardio/mat workout she described on the show. Then we got this video within a week. I have done a lot of working out in my days, but I was shocked to see my butt disappear in a matter of a week!  I lost 4 lbs. in two weeks and my husband lost 8 lbs.

I think that speaks for itself.

I think you have to stick to the routine religiously (do cardio first) 6x a week and I think the diet of no oils, sauces, spices, sugar, alcohol and caffeine also had a big part in the results.

3562628,5,B001F2HZHI,"I first heard of Tracy Anderson as I discovered her dance aerobic dvd while searching for fitness dvds to add to my collection. I was tempted as she looked like a glossy fitness guru with some excellent references; Madonna(!). I liked the dance aerobic DVD and when the mat workout was released in Europe I bought that one as well.
What I really like about the DVD is that it's professionally done, everything from the sound, the visuals, the technical bit, it's practically flawless (I own tons of similar DVDs and there are some really weak ones out there) It's all so polished and glossy.
The workout is featured in a nice living room, which is a good and realistic setting for a workout you're supposed to perform at home. Tracy looks stunning, tiny teeny body, but fit and firm and she's very gorgeous. The music is good, nothing familiar (at least not too me), but still catchy. Tracy explains her method and technique and she comes across as an experienced and believeable trainer. I like the concept of working the small muscle groups which is essential in her theory. She claims it's important to focus on the smaller muscle groups to avoid bulking up and therefore never to use heavy weights and stick to 2-3 pounds. At some point you will have to lift and carry items (groceries, kids) that are heavier than 2-3 pounds, but I hope she meant it from a exercise point of view, and not a rule to apply to everyday life.
The workout includes a lot of rotations and lifting your legs and arms. She warns you that you will feel a burning sensation, and it's so true! It is so painful at times! But you just have to keep going, doing lots of repetitions.

She advises you to do this workout at least four times a week to get amazing results, and combine it with cardio (I think she recommends doing her cardio dvd every day!). But of course you will look good with that much exercise!
It is a hard and tough workout, but it feels really good afterwards. I have to admit that I have not been able to do this four times a week, so I haven't seen any amazing transformations, but I will continue using her workout and principles, and then we'll see!",1267660800,,2150,4.456852791878172
3562629,4,B001F2HZHI,"I really love doing this video and actually look forward to it! The moves, since they are unique are kind of addictive and make your entire body feel worked, stretched out and graceful afterwards. I am 2 months into just using this DVD 3-4 times a week, and walking a few miles a week, eating an average healthy diet, and my body has changed dramatically. I was already petite but my legs and thighs and butt have always been on the stocky side. They are actually SHRINKING! My tightest jeans are even loose on me. I was actually EXCITED to bathing suit shop for the first time! The place I noticed change first was thighs. It feels like fat is being replaced by muscle, and looks like everything is being tightened and moved inward. The jiggles and cellulite are decreasing too! The wonders of muscle!

My arms are the same size but shapely and full of muscle rather than flab and a little muscle. They are becoming very defined, especially in the shoulder area. I also just started to do the arm sections twice every workout.
Warning about the arm section though:

I was noticing my arms- WOW! more definition, much stronger in just 3 weeks or so. But my RIGHT ARM is almost double the size of the left. TRACY DOESN'T COUNT HER REPS! It's my own fault for not counting to double check, but I assumed on an exercise DVD where reps are ALL she is doing, she would be paying attention to rep numbers. Why isn't someone off screen at least counting? What is she possibly thinking about?! It's almost as if she is just changing exercises on a whim (which is part of the fun in the dance abs section) but NOT good when trying to sculpt muscle on your arms evenly! I was wondering why for weeks I still couldn't get through the arm section where she holds one weight out straight for the entire time the other arm is doing up down rotations and it's because one arm is literally DOUBLE the first arm. There are many arm exercises where she is not just a rep or two off, but 5-6 reps, even a solid minute! No wonder! I corrected this in about 2 weeks, I went back and did the arm section twice, compensating with weights on just that one arm and arms are even now.

I am also frustrated with the non-chaptering of this DVD. She even suggests if arms get easy to go back and do it again, and since I actually do the arm sections twice it's a pain to rewind slowly through.

ABS are great. That was the first result I noticed (2 weeks in or so! and my stomach all the way down my abdomen is strong and lean.

Overall, LOVE the RESULTS! Tracy Anderson, please PLEASE PLEASE COUNT YOUR REPS for the next DVD! I love your style and the free movement you incorporate so I'd like to buy the next, but not if it's like this. :(",1267574400,8,2713,4.301369863013699

I like the fact that she does not talk too much because when you do the workout daily hearing the same instructions over and over again can get really annoying!  The exercises don't need much instructions, it's very easy to follow. You need to be patient the first couple of times and once you do the DVD a few times you don't need much instructions because you know exactly what is next! I guess people are used to being told what to do all the time and this may be unusual for them.. I personally prefer her way.

The exercises are challenging and just wonderful. I love doing this workout and I do it daily because I enjoy it so much (I am a beginner and don't usually take joy in exercising)! I definitely recommend this DVD!",1267315200,,751,4.3120567375886525

I am an advanced exerciser and my legs and stomach and arms have never looked so toned. SERIOUSLY.  I know she has a lot of negative media surrounding her, but her workouts WORK.  She says some ridiculous things about not lifting more than three pounds because it will cause ""bulk"" which is totally untrue (I lift 15 pound dumbells and I have stick arms)but aside from that silliness she is really motivating.  It's obvious to me, a dancer, that she has really good dance training and her workouts are really good for dancers because they work the same muscles dancers use and ignore the ones you don't want to overtrain. I highly recommend her videos for dancers that want to strengthen and tone more, but don't want to lose their line and dancer's build. I really, truly, strongly feel that her workouts have made me look better than ever and really given me amazing definition. Plus, the workouts are fun and I look forward to them.

I workout regularly yet this still was very challenging for me. I like that it is not big weights but more focused on power moves. You can feel the workout during and after, a little sore the first time.

3562635,4,B001F2HZHI,"I purchased this DVD after enjoying the Cardio Dance DVD. At first, I only felt the burn while doing the exercises and I was not that sore after I first did this workout - so now I really pay attention to form and just hit pause and add on more reps as I continue to use this DVD. To prevent boredom in general with exercise, after this DVD I sometimes add on my own traditional strength training (lunges, push ups) or do a segment from the Exhale DVDS and/or Jillian Michaels Shred.

It motivates me well.",1265760000,3,352,4.268656716417911
3562640,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have been doing the the TA Mat DVD for five weeks, about 3-4 times a week. When I came across the method in a magazine write-up, I was intrigued by the idea of strengthening ""the smaller muscle groups so that these muscles can pull in the large muscles"". Well, whatever this sequence does, it seems to work, and work quickly!

My background: I'm in my late 20s, tall and thin, but have really muscular legs and arms for a woman. Before I began supplementing with this DVD I would walk and hike about 6-9 hours weekly, do aerobic type yoga 2-4 hours per week, and do an upper body free weight session 2-4x per week. I have always enjoyed being strong and fit, but have often found it difficult to find pants that don't cut off my leg circulation and still fit my slim waist (the skinny jean is truly evil!). Unfortunately, custom clothes are not in my near future.

Since my ancestors all come from Germany, Denmark, etc. and also tend to grow big muscles rather than lean ones I thought for years that bulky muscles were just the result of my genetics. After seeing the noticeable results I've achieved from this DVD after only a month - bulky muscles starting to slim and lengthen, beautiful definition in all the right places, I'm convinced that ""nurture"" has a big role to play as well. As a bonus, my skin has become more toned and baby butt smooth - I guess maybe from increased circulation from using all the muscles in the various rotations. I feel more sexy in my body and my muscles feel stronger and more cohesive - like they are working in tandem more, rather than just a few muscles doing all the work. I've cut back on my other exercise activities, but have found bonus improvement there as well: I have more endurance when hiking and when I do yoga I'm able to hold poses for longer lengths of time.

The DVD isn't perfect...
In some places I think Tracy does a few more reps on one side than on the other. Sometimes she moves on to a new movement without any verbal cue, causing you to have to keep watching all the time. Also, she could slow down the stretches at the beginning and end, and perhaps give some alignment instruction for beginners.

But, overall I don't feel these are good reasons to not to try this DVD or give it 5 stars. I can't wait to try the new ones coming out.",1265414400,6,2301,4.356643356643357

3562642,5,B001F2HZHI,"I am a personal trainer that has worked out intensly for over 10 years. It has been near impossible for me to lose that last 5-10lbs despite consistant almost daily cardio, weight training a couple times a week, and a reasonably clean diet. I have heard it all (mainly from men trainers) about how women cannot buk. This is bull, there are indeed some women, myself included, that just get bigger and bigger lifting heavy. Frustrated after gaining like 6lbs of muscle working with a trainer, shirts and pants got tighter and tighter, I started doing pilates, yoga, and the barr method. Nothing has been able to take down the bulkiness and lean me out.
I am so happy to say that 1 week after doing this mat video 6 times and 5 hours of my usual cardio, my arms have tighten up drastically and I am definately fitting into my jeans better. This is nothing short of a miracle workout if you are consistant. It is the best dvd I have purchased!! I am so excited to see how great I will look in a couple months!

3562644,5,B001F2HZHI,"I turned 60 in September (60 is the new 40), still turning heads and wish to continue, so I decided to get a bit more serious about my workout. I have used the TA mat workout for about 2 months now. It took about 3-4 weeks to get used to the correct movements but I have to say I love this workout, and have seen improvement in my body tone. For me the arm session is the toughest part but my biceps have changed and there's no bulking up like a man. I try to do this workout 4 times a week but corp America and a busy lifestyle sometimes interfere. 6 days a week would give you no life I would think. Tracey is definitely in tune with how to change a woman's body. LOVE this workout and highly recommend it! My daughter just bought me the cardio dance DVD which seems a lot to learn but that's my next challenge. Buy this Mat workout and challenge yourself, you won't be disappointed!",1264636800,9,885,4.121387283236994
3562645,5,B001F2HZHI,"I started doing this workout a little over a month ago and I am very happy with it. It's challenging but the results are fast and so your strength increases quickly - an excellent resistance workout to add to your cardio.

I alternate this tape with other resistance training and I began seeing results in the shape of my arms, legs, and abs after doing it only a few times. The arm workout is definitely the highlight of the DVD and something I have never seen before - and it is tough but it works.

Also exceptional is the music and choreography as they fit together very very well. The timing was very well done.

I agree with other reviewers that the cuing could be better, but you pick up her moves quickly and by the second or third times doing the workout it's not a big problem - just make sure you keep your eyes on her during the ab workout, she sometimes switches sides without saying anything.

I do have one point of disagreement with Tracy - I have been a long distance runner for more than 15 years and though I am short with a body type similar to hers, I am no bulkier than she is. I say do resistance training that aims for higher reps and lower weights to avoid bulking but don't be scared away from doing the cardio you enjoy.",1264377600,12,1247,4.248945147679325

Which is what we should be looking for in an exercise program. Right?  I am consistent with it and use it now to maintain the results I have achieved.,1264204800,4,450,4.172413793103448

I have also ordered the dance dvd which should be pretty interesting considering I am not a dancer at all!!

Once I try it out for a week or so I will report back.

I would Google Tracy Anderson and check out some of the webisodes online if you are still not sure about her method.

Very good info out there!!",1263945600,2,533,4.0
3562650,5,B001F2HZHI,"This is a terrific DVD, as is the dance cardio DVD. I have done both--it is very hard to fit 2 hours of fitness into the average person's schedule, but if you can do it, you will truly see the results. (Luckily I don't have kids. I DO have a job that goes over 8 hours a day sometimes.) I can't always do 2 hours, I love food, and I just turned 40, but this series still helps keep me in good shape.

I don't know much about her personally, but I find Ms. Anderson really likeable and encouraging, actually. I agree that with the mat DVD, there's not always a tremendous amount of instruction, but I find that once you've done it a few times and get more comfortable with it, you notice more details and ""catch on."" I like the music, too.

My one and only complaint, and this is probably somehow my fault, is that both of these DVDs have stopped working in my !@#$ DVD player. The dance cardio DVD looks scratched now so I know that one's my fault, but this one doesn't look scratched at all and I haven't had it long. Has anyone else had this problem? If so, the DVD quality itself may not be all that great. If not, I am tough on DVDs, which wouldn't really shock me.

This is a no joke workout and I can feel my body has changed with just 1 (seriously) workout!!  It is very tough and I bearly made it through the first time around.  I am extremly sore today, and I can't wait to see how my body is going to change with the DVD.  I plan on doing it 3 - 4 times a week, complemented by running every other day.  BUY IT!!  It is worth the money, but I would say it is only for the Intermediate to Advanced, or those who need little instruction during the workout and willing to work up to an advanced level.

3562652,3,B001F2HZHI,"After viewing the snippets on Extra, E etc., and seeing her routine I was excited to try. But for 30$ its just ok. She does the first part of the workout doing legs lifts and kicks with a chair. Honestly I could do this by myself without a dvd. She doesn't talk that much while she excercises. She lacks personality. The Madonna-ish music in the background and her dance like moves makes me feel like I could have just danced around my house and received the same type of workout. The ab routine is standing and very Madonna dance like and its brief. The arm workout is similar but so far is the best part of the dvd, at least when weights are added. I do this with 2lbs as well.  These moves seem like the kind of thing any experienced, or intermediate could conjure up at home i.e. just dance around and move and lift legs on the chair. A friend is lending me the post preg dvd of hers,which is suppose to focus on abs.

Her demeanor is ""too cool"" almost snotty. Don't care for it. But I'll move past that and do the dvd to get monies worth.

in short, its a good supplement to a workout but its not my core workout.  A pilates dvd would have been a better investment. I bought into the hype after seeing Madonna and Gwyneth's body.",1263340800,2,1234,4.216101694915254
3562653,4,B001F2HZHI,"I so want to give this five stars, because the workout itself is definitely a 5 star workout. But like most others have noted, there is not enough cuing but more importantly, Tracy doesn't advise how to adapt movements to prevent strain or injury, either at all or until she's already gone through many repetitions. As far as the cues go, you can work around that pretty easily. The movements aren't complicated and it just takes a little extra attention the first couple of times. Watch her foot and hand positions to clarify leg and arm alignments. The foot is in neutral position except when she specifies pointe, so it's easy to line your knee and hip up correctly by noting foot placement. Also, don't pay too much attention at first to her admonition to keep going no matter how much it burns - that's fine after you've done it a few times and worked up to it but trust me, you'll get a good workout even if you cut yourself a little slack at first. Not a lot, just a little. You know, so you can still walk up and down stairs the next day and lift a glass of water. One thing she never specifically mentions is keeping abdominals pulled in and pelvis tucked throughout, which is important for correct form and back support. But the workout itself is stellar. The routine that works best for me is two days on, one day off, which gives 5 days a week and still allows some muscle recovery time (on the ""off"" days I do a different workout). One other note: the cool down is short and it's a great opportunity to follow this workout with as much stretching as you can fit in, since muscles you never knew you had will be nice and warm and you will be much less sore later on if you do this.",1262995200,11,1693,4.310344827586207

3562655,4,B001F2HZHI,"I like this DVD and I think it's a good workout. But it's frustrating because she often seems like she's up there doing her own free flow dance - much of it kind of stripper-like - without saying anything about changing sides or that she's going onto a new exercise. I mean she offers hardly ANY direction. You're just supposed to watch her do her thing and join in if you can. But it does feel like a good workout. I've just done it a few times but I feel more pulled in, more tight.",1262131200,2,484,4.105263157894737
3562656,4,B001F2HZHI,"I was really excited to get this Tracy Anderson video though it was pretty costly, but I am a stickler for a celebrity endorsed product. Actually seeing Gwyneth Paltrow sweat it out with Tracy herself inspired me to order this DVD, but once I actually viewed it in its entirety...Whoa! I sang a different tune after that. This little pint sized diva is an exercise anomaly!  She busts out excruciating repetitious moves without so much as batting an eye, while I was in complete agony!! I couldn't imagine myself doing this routine everyday,but I'm sure those who can stick with the program will see results...I would recommend this DVD but only for the determined and brave at heart.",1261267200,,684,4.796610169491525

3562658,2,B001F2HZHI,"As a Pilates teacher I always look for new ideas and methods. I take classes and I watch videos. Tracy is not instructing for the average person in this video. I found myself constantly watching her to try and figure out what she was talking about. If she was actually cuing it would be simple to follow her. But all she is doing is moving around and pouting at the camera. Yes she has some great concepts and movements, but she is teaching by her instinct not by practical instructions. She is very quiet while moving without telling the audience how to stand, shift, or align themselves. Nothing. I can see how she would be fun in a room; live. But when a person needs details from a video, alone at home, this video is lacking on the basic essence on instruction.",1260921600,2,766,4.401408450704225

It is the best workout. You don't need anything except a chair for balance and 1,2, or 3 lb. weights. (You can even use cans of soda if you don't want to buy weights.) I am a very healthy person.

3562660,5,B001F2HZHI,"Love this DVD. This routine truly gives your muscles a longer slimmer look - even more so than Yoga or Pilates. I bulked up too much at the gym lifting heavy weights, especially in my arms and back. I rotate this DVD with other routines. I still go to the gym but took Tracy's advice and only use low weight and high repetition. You have to change your routine anyway after 10 sessions so the muscles don't get used to it. I also took her advice about making dancing my main cardio beacause dancing hits the muscles from all angles. ZUMBA works well and is lower impact. Will definitely keep this DVD in regular rotation.",1259971200,11,621,4.408695652173913
3562661,4,B001F2HZHI,"I'm 36 and have consistently exercised for most of my life - usually 3-4 times a week for an hour or so. I started with step aerobics years ago and have been doing spinning classes and jogging for the last few years.  I've gone through phases of adding strength training to my routing - either through body sculpting classes or using free weights/lunging on my own.  It seems like I'd make it a few months of doing it a couple of times a week but never saw huge results and felt like my time was better spent on cardio.

That was all until I tried TA's mat workout.  I started about 6 months ago - 3 times a week after my jogging or biking cardio workout.  That made 2 hour sessions 3 times a week.  I found the mat workout totally different than anything I'd ever done.  I couple of parts in the workout were painful to get though, but they didn't last long and overall I could complete the workout in full. I definitely started to notice a change in tone, especially my arms and shoulders which became more defined.  I surprisingly didn't get bored with the workout.  While I agree with everyone that it's hard to follow the first few times you do the workout because she doesn't cue, it's easy to follow along once you go through it a couple of times.  Pretty quickly I was able to do the mat workout while watching TV. I use my TV picture-in-picture or play it on my laptop off to the side (which is especially great when travelling) with the volume off.  I can easily follow along without having to listen and even watch.

In the last couple of months I've upped my workout routine to 4-5 times a week and I'm seeing even more amazing results.  Perhaps if I spent as much time lifting weights and doing lunges I would see equally great results; but while I'm sure I'd at least be bored, I'm also a big believer in that the movements she creates actually do work different muscle groups which create a longer and leaner look.  I haven't lost much weight, but my clothes are much looser.

Here are the negatives:
1.  She doesn't cue You just have to watch and mirror her movements.
2.  She doesn't explain form.  You need to have a basic understanding of this on your own.
2.  She doesn't equally work both sides of the body.  I fix this by starting out on different legs each time I do the workout and counting out specific sections to make sure they're even.

I hope she comes out with another mat routine for some variety. I've also tried the dance cardio workout which is tolerable but I'm not fan.  I'll post a review or it as well.",1259712000,3,2540,4.325581395348837

You really have to find a good angle to see what she is doing at all times, which is also bad when you are doing floor work for your abs.  It is a great workout though and you will definitly feel the burn.  I do not care what she says about lifting weights makes you bulky, I lift heavy and incorporate a variety of workouts into my routine and went from a 15 to a size 4.",1259625600,,475,3.8762886597938144
3562663,5,B001F2HZHI,"I've been an avid exerciser and dancer my whole life. At 5'3"" and 120 pounds, I'm fit and at a healthy weight, but the coveted ""dancer's body"" has eluded me, largely due to my body type (I have short arms and legs and broad shoulders). I have worked out with heavy weights, and while it's true that this did not make me look like a man, I looked way more muscular than I wanted to--due to my short stature and study frame, it's relatively easy for me to pack on a decent amount of muscle bulk for a woman. When I saw Tracy Anderson on Oprah and heard her say that women should never lift more than 3 pounds, I knew exactly where she was coming from. There's nothing wrong with women lifting heavy weights if that's what they want to do, but darn it, I want a ""teeny tiny dancer's body"", and there's nothing wrong with that, either! Within the first month of doing this workout 3-4 times per week, my arms and shoulders have leaned out in a way that I thought would be impossible for my body type. My arms look sleek and toned, and have the long, lean dancer's aesthetic that I've always wanted and thought I could never have. I'm slowly losing my lower belly pooch as well, and my thighs are getting sculpted without becoming bulkier (I already have overdeveloped quads, so squats and lunges aren't the best exercises for me). If you want to achieve a strong, yet graceful and lean dancer-type body, this is the workout for you. By the way, I've practiced yoga and pilates mat videos for years; these workouts are great but did very little to change the shape of my arms, belly, and thighs.",1259107200,18,1590,4.375

3562665,4,B001F2HZHI,I try to workout 6 days a week for around 30 min. to an hr. I like the Matt Workout. At first it was very challenging but if you do it consistently it gets easier. I do it every other day with some form of cardio on alternate days. I like that Tracy is quiet and the music is rhythmic and takes you thru the moves. Having said that it is difficult at time to tell exactly how some of the positions should be done in order to get maximum benefits. Tracy could explain the positions a bit better but overall I like this workout.,1258329600,2,526,4.019047619047619
3562666,4,B001F2HZHI,"I like this workout.  The arm sections in particular were killer.  I could barely get through the unweighted portion and then going straight into the arms with weights was brutal!  The rest of the workout is very doable.  It is true that Tracy doesn't cue ahead at all and rarely cues as she goes, but I didn't find it to be a big deal.  You just have to learn the routine, which happens naturally with repeated use.  And this eliminates a lot of annoying chatter.  I actually wish she talked a little less...which brings me to why I took away one star.  I find Tracy a little odd.  I'm not sure if she is the expert she thinks she is.  For example, when I began lifting heavier weights, my arms actually got smaller in a pleasing way, rather than the BULKING she refers to repeatedly.  So I disagree with Tracy on this point.  And she does seem a little in love with herself, like maybe I bought the DVD to look at her rather than for a workout.  She is a bit pose-y throughout.  The music is very pleasant and helps make the time go by.  This will definitely see repeated use.",1258070400,,1078,4.267326732673268

If you are not already in pretty good shape then you will find this this workout to be a BIG challenge. There are lots of repetitive small movements to create muscle exhaustion. And if you aren't a naturally gifted mover you might feel clunky doing this workout. Especially the standing ab series where there is little verbal instruction, just visual cues. I do this video on weekends after a cardio workout, as Tracey recommends. Some people call her extreme, but she's just being honest. If you want really amazing results, you need to put in the time. Too many people in the U.S consider walking - or whatever other silly things that don't cause you pain - exercise. If you want to get fit, it's going to hurt a bit, and require some real effort.

I would have like to give this DVD 5 stars except for the fact that after using it for 3 weeks I still cannot master the standing abdominal exercises.  Now I just skipped that and use Gilads Body Sculpt for abdomen. When I first started I've to stop 5 times during the weight free arm exercises (I've been using 10 lbs weights for the last 2 years). I saw TA on an interview that she will be working on New DVDs and I hope she will provide more instructions especially the standing abdomen exercises.",1257724800,,717,5.828571428571428
3562669,2,B001F2HZHI,"I've tried a LOT of exercise DVDs. While this is not, by any means, the worst, I do not feel it's been worth the weighty price tag. Here's the lowdown: Tracy does NOT do the same number of repetitions on each side (be it a leg or an arm rep). I find this to be irritating, amateurish, and proof that the workout has NOT been well thought out or rehearsed. She's also very non-communicative. I don't like DVD workout instructors that yammer on throughout, but I *would* have liked a bit more instruction on technique. Again, the workout seems a little amateur in that regard. Secondly, I think it's too long for a mat workout. You need to do these kind of workouts at least 4 to 5 days a week for any result. But it's not aerobic. That means you probably need to find an extra 30 to 60 minutes for your aerobic workout in addition to the hour for this one. Most people don't have that much time. It would have been nice if she'd had an abbreviated workout option included in the DVD. The FIRM exercise DVDs and the GAIAM Pilates and Yoga DVDS win hands down over this. I'm not convinced.",1256256000,,1086,4.302439024390244
3562690,4,B001F2HZHI,"I am really enjoying the Mat Workout DVD from Tracy Anderson. I really need to tone up and this video is working. It is great for the legs, abs and arms.  I really needed a video that would help me tone up my arms. This video is on-going instruction and very motivating.

Although, I am looking for the name of that song that Tracy Anderson, plays when she is doing the stand up abs work.

It goes something like this, """"Inside my head I look around so tense and can't sleep at night. Is it just a dream or passion inside my head. I look around and I talk to myself.
Can't sleep at night the shadows on my wall. Or is it  just a dream Or is it just a dream.
I'm going crazy, I am going out my mind. I feel so crazy, crazy, crazy"".

Does anyone know the name of this song or the artist?

My only complaint with the DVD is that she is terrible at queing; she frequently changed exercies without giving notice to the viewer.  It can be a little frustrating.,1256083200,,330,4.360655737704918
3562694,4,B001F2HZHI,I really like this workout DVD. It's perfect for me on those evenings when I just can't make it to the gym but still want a real workout. Her method works. She gets you to work out those troubled areas and muscles that you may not always get to when working out at the gym. Although she says to do the routine 4 to 6 times a week it can get boring. I try to do it 3 times a week. I would definitey recommend this DVD and plan to purchase the Post Pregnancy DVD after my child is born.,1255996800,,484,3.85

I have her two other videos, but I like the Mat Workout so much that those don't get used much. I'm doing Turbo Jam (without the weighted gloves!) for cardio. Honestly, with cardio that is so much fun, and Tracy's wonderful Mat Workout, it doesn't feel like exercising at all.

It's quite challenging, but you can really feel yourself improving.  I would also reccomend her post pregnancy dvd, I think I almost prefer it, but they are both absolutely fabulous.

3562721,5,B001F2HZHI,"Alright, this may end up being a long review but here goes...

I recently recieved this dvd and while I cannot yet attest to its longterm benefits or enjoyment, I can give my first impressions on it. First and foremost, if you are someone who likes to have very thorough instructions and cueing then this is absolutely NOT for you.

I personally do not prefer to have personalities like Denise Austen and the like instructing me. I don't want a cheerleader - I want to be able to focus on the exercise and not be bothered with chatter. Having said this, the other reviews on here are correct, Tracy's cueing leaves a little to be desired. She does on occasion change moves or streches without giving you a heads up. I expected this from the reviews so when I encountered this, it didn't really bother me. While you have to pay a little more attention until you are familiar with the routine to know when she switches moves, her lack of cueing is not a deal breaker.

I really liked her personality. She explains things but doesn't bother with very much talking in between. She only sometimes mentions that you have '5 left' or 'this has got to be burning right now, I know its hard!' It allows me to focus on what I am doing because some of these moves are downright hard, but in a good way.

I have a variety of workout dvds and I can honestly say she introduced a whole new set of moves that I hadn't done before. Her dvd is not chaptered out but it begins with a warmup that has some plies in it and then moves into leg work. I love that she focuses on the bum and thighs with an emphasis on not bulking up these areas. There is not a single squat or lunge which for me is wonderful since I can't stand doing these. There are a couple sections of this and then she moves into arm work. This section is the hardest in my opinion. She does a routine without weights (which is surprisingly exhausting) and then immediately follows it with a version where weights are incorporated. This is then followed by ab work which feels very effective and introduces ab work with more moves I had not done before. There is one more cool down that is somewhat similar to the warm up and then the dvd is finished.

It goes by much faster then I expected as it comes in somewhere just under an hour. If there were two things with this workout I would change it would be the following: I felt that I would have had more of a benefit having a cool down that included more stretching and slow movements. It had more engery then warmup at times! The other thing is that she does NOT do an equal amount of reps on each side. She will exhaust one side with x amount of reps and then seemingly do half the amount on the other side. This is my only real point of contention as I find it highly annoying. My solution was simply to pause the tape after I saw her do a few of the moves and then did about 20 reps to start. This worked out for me and while it added some extra minutes to the overall completion time, it was worth it to have both sides worked out equally.

Another note, I was little skeptical with all the five star reviews, when I checked out the contributors 'other reveiws' very often there were none. I got the impression perhaps that the almost 5 star rating this dvd has was padded. I still am not sure about the vaildity of some but I do think this workout is worth 5 stars for me. I prefer workouts that are based on pilates and yoga (Exhale Spa dvd's are AMAZING!) and this dvd is a great addition to my collection. Somewhere I read about a diet plan that Tracy has to supplement her workouts. I am very loosely following it with the help of the 'think thin' bars that she recommends. I also have a review on those too. I hope this helped, I was on the fence about this dvd for months due to the price but to be honest, I feel that her moves are so different and enjoyable that it was worth the money.",1255132800,7,3901,4.215528781793842
3562722,4,B001F2HZHI,"Great DVD, really happy I bought it. Tough! First time I did it I couldn't complete the hour, it just got harder and harder. Haven't bought an exercise DVD for ages, would recommend this one, slowly built up to be able to complete it. Only improvement would be if the sections were broken up so that if you only had 20mins you could immediately jump into a specific section.",1255132800,,374,4.434782608695652
3562723,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have exercised and danced my whole life, taught aerobics, Pilates, yoga and traditional toning classes for 15 years and HIGHLY recommend this workout.  While Tracy utilizes many  familiar forms of movement taken from ballet, Pilates, Callanetics, and good old fashioned calisthenics; she puts them all together in her own unique format.
I am 50 years old and must say that whatever people may say about this method, it does work. It is not easy and it is difficult at first but it achieves what she promises: a lithe, feminine and toned body. I have both the mat and post pregnancy workouts even though I had my last child at the age of 30, the ab work in the post pregnancy DVD is worth the price of the DVD alone. I am buying her cardio DVD today.",1255132800,,751,4.474452554744525
3562724,5,B001F2HZHI,"For anyone who is willing to put in the effort this dvd is fantastic!! I think Tracy has figured out the way to be long and lean and not bulky. She hits your smaller muscles groups in many different directions and it works. Like any form of excercise you have to do the work, nothing comes for free. You must remember this when your doing the arm sections because they kill.
This is so good for the 'at home' excerciser like me. Do the tape after a cardio work out.

The DVD could improve definitely though.  Tracy Anderson is not a good teacher.  You kind of have to figure it out what to do by just looking at her.  She doesn't talk much or give instructions.  There is no caption or anything. I still don't get the standing abs part because it's kind of like dancing and I can't dance.
You will sweat and your muscles will be killing you.  It does produces results and that's what I like.
This is a great workout for someone who doesn't like intensive cardio or aerobic like workout.  If you like pilates and yoga but want something that will give faster results than those, then this is it.",1254096000,2,797,4.231788079470198

3562728,4,B001F2HZHI,"I don't usually write reviews due to time constraints but had to find time to share what I experienced with this workout.
I usually train 6 days a week, a combination of running, martial arts, power yoga, pilates and used to do strength training but gave it up as it makes me bulky.

I took up pilates to lose the bulk and it worked up to a point, but not much.

I purchased this dvd about 6 months ago and used it a few times before giving up as it is very taxing.......however the results were amazing.....and thats the reason why I started using it again recently..

I used it 4 times in about 9 days and also ran for about 45 minutes on 2 days, diet was unchanged.  My arms are becoming so toned that my clothing has become loose, same thing around my abs area and also legs. My butt has tightened and is lifting ( how nice !).
And this is after only 4 days.  I have had to give it a break as I have developed lower back pain due to this workout and wish some further instruction or stretching was included to prevent that.  This is the reason I have given it 4 stars and not 5.  I would recommend using caution when using this workout as you could injure yourself either from over training or over extending , so its important to listen to your body rather than 'working through the pain'..

When I get back to it ( because I will :-) ), I will build up slowly and think this will hopefully prevent back pain.  Also would recommend stretching the spine at the end of the workout.
It would be a shame if I could never use this dvd again as this is delivering unbelievable results.

I hope to post another review after doing this for a few months :-)",1253059200,5,1653,4.169811320754717

My arms and abs are toner, and my waistline is trimmer, than they ever have been - and I've worked out- cardio and  weights- for years and years. I do the dvd about 5-6 times a week, sometimes I have to spit it up so that I can fit it into a work day, but it still gives great results. For the first few weeks, I couldn't even finish the dvd, and I definitely couldn't finish the arms with the light weights, even though I've used much heavier weights in the gym. Tracy Anderson does lose count and sometimes does way more reps on one side than another. But if you correct for that and just even it out, it's no big deal. The results of the workout out-weigh the ""problems"". She also doesn't cue very well, so you have to pay close attention and learn the routines so that you can anticipate what's coming up without depending on her cueing. If you can get over those two things, you'll LOVE the results! I've had to have all my pants taken in, or get new ones - including workout pants!

The TA Post-Pregnancy dvd is a lot of ab work where this one is more legs and arms, I would say.  The exercises are very challenging and they target the smaller muscle groups so you won't get bulky.  The Mat dvd is a lot of standing excerises actually, so be prepared for that.  The moves don't look hard, but boy, my muscles were 'crying' the first few times!  There is no cardio work here, so it would be great to pair it with your favorite cardio program, or try the TA Dance Cardio dvd if your coordinated enough.  You'll need 3lb weights and a sturdy chair for some of the leg work.

3562747,4,B001F2HZHI,I have to admit I had reservations about this DVD. One reason was for the price which is much higher than other DVD's and the other is all the hype surrounding the association of Tracy training Madonna and Gweneth Paltrow. However I gave it try and I am certainly not disappointed. I have seen results from just 3 weeks of consistent workout. It is a good pace and some of the moves can be quite challenging. I appreciate that there is very little talking or instruction. All the moves are simple to follow and pretty basic -but very effective. And the service surpassed my expectations. They were very prompt and efficient. My one critique is that there should have been chapters in the DVD to make it easier to jump ahead or repeat a particular excercise.,1251763200,,757,4.573529411764706

3562780,5,B001F2HZHI,"Me and my mom have different body types and different approaches to working out, but we both decided we had to do something different to get fit! (She has around 10 pounds to lose, I have around 6)

I've tried tons of different classes at the gym, from pilates, yoga, tae bo, step aerobics, dance aerobics, and have been doing cardio on an elliptical for quite a while now!

On the other hand, my mom is not as active, shes has been to circuit gyms in the past, but mostly walks and recently started doing a little cardio on the elliptical! We are both very short, 5 ft! And I gain weight in my thigs and butt, and she gains weight in her upper body...

We've been doing the mat workout religiously for a week, and the results are amazing!! My mom's waistline is starting to be more defined, and her lower back seems to be quickly toning! My legs are super tight and my butt is shrinking!

I know it may seem crazy to see results so fast, but I have tried tons of different exercises and the great thing about this dvd is the different rotations she uses. The first days it really did hurt doing so many repetitions but after the third you get used to it, so don't quit!

You will not regret buying this. But you do have to do it 6 times a week to see results so fast.

Also, my mom has been dieting (a healthy diet, not the diet that Tracy recommends)while doing the workout, I haven't, and still the results are great for both of us!

The only problem I found is that she doesn't count repetitions so much, and sometimes loses the count.",1251417600,,1539,4.2320819112627985
3562781,4,B001F2HZHI,"I realized after doing this workout that I was working out wrong for my body type.  I am 5'4, 120 lbs but tend to carry all my weight in my lower half-- ""soccer legs"" as I call them-- just strong short, muscular legs that tend to bulk.  Super ripped on top, and bulkier on the bottom.

Yes, this workout will absolutely sculpt your bottom and stomach.  Now here is my caveat-- I still swim, run and do power yoga- all no-nos according to Tracy so in that sense I did not follow the program strictly (which advocates her cardio dance and mat workout ONLY).  What I did do was drop all the weights on the bottom- I abandoned my kettlebells and all types of squats and lunges and machines at the gym- even gave up doing them without weights.  I confess that I did do weights on top, but that is because I don't want the ""teeny tiny"" arms she promises-- I like my body looking muscular and athletic on top.

After two months of doing this three times a week (along with swim, run and yoga on the other days), I have seen a HUGE improvement mainly in my butt, hips and stomach. My stomach has really nice cuts all over.

I will also add that I am over 40 and just had a baby 6 months ago and exercised throughout my pregnancy and did not gain that much so I was in good shape to begin with. While I don't agree with Tracy's philosophy 100%, I have to say that for girls like me who have very muscular legs to start with doing leg weights- ANY type of leg weights--is a bad bad bad idea.  I feel that the combo of sensible eating (not dieting), vigorous cardio 3 or 4 times a week (I don't believe in 5 or 6- way too much), yoga for lengthening, stretching and mental health, as well as this mat workout will create a nice lean look.

Again, I can't really opine on the arms b/c while the arm section is a killer, I still do a ton of arm weights, pull ups and pushups -- as well as swimming and yoga, which all very much hit the arms, so I can't really tell what the arm results are from.

But if you tend to bulk on the bottom, please give up the weights and try this! I have definitely lost inches off the hips/butt since I've started.",1251417600,15,2131,4.110843373493976

Although the workout was difficult to complete, I felt like I was losing muscle tone instead of gaining it. On top of that, I did not like the style of the video in that Tracy Anderson was more concerned about how cute she was instead of making an effort to put together a professional video. I feel that if a person is going to go through the trouble of making a workout video, he/she could at the least make an effort to work out each side evenly. She does not during MANY points in this video. Also there are no chapters in the whole hour workout. Even though I was this unimpressed, I was thinking of at least trying to continue with the arm segment (even though it's not even) but I don't have time to sit there and fast forward until I get there. There really could have been a couple chapters thrown in. I guess what bothers me the most is that the video comes across as paying much more attention to the ""look"" and fancy camera work and Tracy having to show the world how hot she believes herself to be and much less about instructing people to become more fit.

I no longer do long cardio workouts 5 days a week at the gym and my body is in the best shape I have ever been in.  I never thought I could have lean feminine arms until I tried this video.  I put muscle on with very little effort, so this is the perfect balance to keep me lean and super sexy.  I highly recommend it.",1250467200,,425,3.8505747126436782
3562785,4,B001F2HZHI,I decided to buy this DVD to use in conjunction with Tracy's cardio DVD (which I love!) and I'm sooooooo glad I did.  You do have to focus on the moves or you could just end up aimlessly moving your arms and legs around without achieving anything.  I've been doing this dvd the recommended 5-6 times a week for the last few weeks and can already see changes in my stomach and arms.  The reason I've given this 4 stars and not 5 is because I think Tracy should give more direction about the leg exercises.  It has a been a bit trial and error and to start with I wasn't sure I was moving my legs in the right way during the standing leg section.  Still this is a really good exercise DVD - I love the fact Tracy doesn't talk lots during the workout and I feel really energised after doing it.,1250380800,,791,4.1103896103896105
3562786,3,B001F2HZHI,"This is definitely a great workout and the exercises are different from any other class/video I've tried before. The music is also a big boost to this video - great tracks, and they don't get annoying even if you use the dvd everyday. I used this video with walking my dog every other day, as well as a reasonable diet. After about a month and a half, I lost a few pounds, and noticed I was smaller in a few key areas.

However, Tracy talks on this dvd and in interviews about how running and other forms of exercise aren't as effective as her method. To get the results she advertises, she recommends a pretty restricted diet, which I'm just not willing to do. Lately I've actually gotten better results from a combination of running and walking 4 - 6 miles 5xs a week on a reasonable diet. Additionally, twice a week I do a 30 minute strength and toning workout from Fitness magazine (the 10 lbs in 30 days workout). I've noticed more improvement than from doing her workout exclusively and in less time that I spent with her method. I don't want to knock her method too much, it definitely does have it's benefits, just don't drink the Tracy Kool-Aid (unless you have the money to get training from her studio, or unless you're willing to go on the starvation diet).",1250294400,8,1269,4.446351931330472

3562789,5,B001F2HZHI,"This is an oustanding arm workout, I noticed results within 3 weeks of doing this workout 3-4 times a week.  When you perform the exercises, you have to really focus on the muscles that are being worked on, otherwise the workout will not be as effective.  For example, when Tracy does the standing ab workout, if you don't focus and flex those ab muscles, it will not have the same effect.  It also seems as thought Tracy is doing some silly dance moves but these exercises really work if you focus on the muscle and flex them as your working out.",1249776000,,547,4.396039603960396

This dvd workout is quite enjoyable and after a couple of weeks my arms already look smaller even though I haven't been consistently working out everyday.  That alone is definitely worth the $30.

This DVD disappointed me as most all of it is done standing up, weight bearing on the feet.  Looks like an awesome workout, hope to be able to do it some day.  But to call this a ""Mat"" workout is a serious misrepresentation of what it's about.  From watching it I would give it a five as a workout... but I'm being generous giving it a two star because it does not deliver what the title says.

It is best, fastest and only, program that has given me a slim firm lean sexy shape. Do the workout consistently and see the results! For the first time in my life I am happy with my appearance. Thank You Tracy!",1249257600,2,493,4.550561797752809

Since I'm not about to spend $900 a month I bought this tape.

At first I really hated Tracy. The pain was so uncomfortable and I couldn't do the reps!
And here I am looking at Tracy who is not even breaking a sweat.
But after my fourth time doing the video, I was able to do almost everything (except the weighted part) well!  It does take practice and the directions on how to hold your legs on certain sections are not very specific but that comes with time.

I'm 5.2' (please, no pity) and usually weigh 115-120(my heavy side).
Within a week and half, I weigh 110 pounds and have distinct cuts in my legs, shoulders, and abs.  My husband constantly tells me that my abs are amazing and that he's seeing muscles in my legs!  I didn't start out with a lot of body weight but my thighs are an issue and I am slimming down everytime I do the video!

Once you get the hang of the video, I suggest doing this 4 times a week for the best results.

I love you now Tracy!!",1249171200,6,1065,4.186274509803922
3562805,5,B001F2HZHI,"Hi There!
I just want to share an info with you about this TAMethod that might be of some interest for some of you. The other day, I was at a gym club, talking to a teacher there about the TAMethod. This woman, on her computer, was, at the same time, watching a clip, on UTube, showing Tracy Anderson performing her ab section in her Mat Workout and my friend, the gym teacher was amazed and told me; ""I teach gymnastic of all kind since all my life and I never saw those movements!"" And she commented, among other things, that the ab section of the TAMethod is working the psoas muscles, so difficult to reach and to train, usually. And I guess it is because of the workingout of my psoas muscles with the TaMethod, that I practiced only four times already, that all of a sudden, my pants are falling from me. I did not understand why I had this feeling of being stretched, from the pubic bone, since I began the TAMethod mat workout. This is because of the psoas awakened by TAMethod!",1248652800,,986,4.306451612903226

Don't waste your time with this one.,1247875200,20,341,4.328125
3562809,2,B001F2HZHI,"Unfortunately, this DVD does not offer any instruction regarding form; the cueing is not evident in Ms. Anderson's work. As a season fitness instructor for 20 years, I was profoundly disappointed with this DVD. My members and clients are complimentary that I always focus on the proper form and technique. I hoped that Ms. Anderson would acknowledge that she was not performing for herself but to assist others in achieving their fitness goals.

The mat workout is easier to follow, and you don't need much room to do it (not like the cardio)... I love this mat workout. It actually feels like you are doing something, and compliments the cardio brilliantly. The arm sections a killer.. but after just a few attempts I am happy to say that I managed to do it all the way though without my arms feeling like they might fall off!!!(no pain no gain huh?) Its still does really kill on the muscles, but then its not meant to be easy... top marks for this, more fab music and love it. The only problem that I can see is that she does says you should do the cardio and the mat workout 4-6times a wk. A full workout to both these would take almost 2hrs... I don't have the time for this.. so I alternate them, and try to do the full 2hrs at leat x1 a wk.. hoping to up this to x2 very soon.

After doing the video about 10 times, I can see my body shrinking and my friend even noticed I looked smaller!  I had been doing another workout program of Kickboxing for a couple months, and had not lost any weight or changed my body much.  I started worrying that my body was stuck since I'm now in my 30's, but kept thinking if Madonna can do it at 50, so can I.  I love Tracy's workout although some of the excercises are a bit strange and move my body in unusual ways, I love the results.  My tush is totally reshaping right now and becoming tighter and firmer, and my jeans are already loose.  I have been doing it pretty much everyday, and then going for a 2 mile walk for cardio.  I'll have to work up to a full hour of more intense cardio!  I love the standing abs which really dig into some muscles that already lost a half inch in my  waist.  Wow, results so fast!  It also doesn't make you sweat so I can do the workout in my hair and makeup, and not even have to take a shower after.  I can't wait to see what I look like in 30 days!

However, the video's cuing is very poor and there are large sections where she changes directions and exercises without telling you what to do. I found this very frustrating. I am not sure why they didn't edit it differently and at least add a voice over to correct this flaw.

(as in the way she talks to you... very down to earth and not over annimated nor is she annoying) I doubt I'll ever get her body, but who knows.

I was able to sort of complete the workout. In the arm section, I thought they were going to fall off so I ""rested"" for a few sets. I'm a mother of two wishing to tone up my middle. Like with any workout, you need discipline. I'll probably never do it 6 times a week like she recommends, but I do need to stop making excuses and put time into myself :)

I've found that my body is changing from doing it everyday, and it's the one thing that despite how tired I may be I never mind doing.

3562860,3,B001F2HZHI,"With the exception of the standing ab exercises, I found the workouts in this video effective. Ms. Anderson accomplishes this by switching positions while performing innumerable repetitions. I can see how this method can tone muscles without bulking up, not that women should worry about that since we don't have the testosterone necessary to look like gorillas. I think it's sad that Ms. Anderson perpetuates this myth with her comments. Weight bearing exercises are essential to strengthen muscles and bones so we can continue living independent, healthy lives as we get older.

As for her teaching methods, Ms. Anderson doesn't display any. If you're not looking at the screen constantly you'll miss when she switches exercises or limbs, she does not offer form guidance, and she doesn't perform the same number of exercises on each side. I suggest you alternate the side of the body you start with (i.e. Monday start with your right leg, Tuesday with the left) that way you'll eventually be even.",1246665600,4,1000,5.0606060606060606

I like the workout as it is different and is easy on my knees. It is more like ballet and pilates, so it is a gentle workout, but not easy. It is just that Tracy is difficult to follow because she does not instruct very well.

What I found most frustrating is that she is not consistant with reps. She will do 25 on the right and 39 on the left for the same excersize! Do that for a while and you will see the difference and that is not easy to fix!

I have watched with pen in hand and wrote out the reps for each side and now do the workout without Tracy! Of course, I do the same amount of reps for each excersize on both sides, but really, for 29.00+ I should NOT have to do that!

To compensate for that, I watched the video through once without doing the exercises, so that I got a sense of how it would progress, and paid special attention during any sections that seemed like I could easily miss something due to the lack of cues.  I think this helped a lot when I actually did the video, as well as keeping that ""Oh no!  I can't dance!"" feeling to a minimum.

This was a really fun workout, and surprisingly rigorous.  I do cardio and lift weights, and I really felt the burn on this.  I think it might be rather hard for a beginner, but the motions themselves are fairly easy to learn.

She gives the right amount of instruction, yet I don't get annoyed by her voice like I do in so many other workout videos. I absolutely dig the music and find myself humming the tunes throughout the day. I have only been doing the workout for about 3 weeks and only do it 2-3 times per week. I feel like I'm getting healthier and slightly more tone.  I would like to increase my frequency and do it 4 times per week. This is not the type of workout that I totally dread doing.  It is kind of long, but seems to go by quickly due to the intensity of each series of moves. It is difficult to do all the moves that she does without taking a brief break at times, but I imagine in time I will get there. There are no moves in this DVD that I hate to do (for example squats, push ups). I can't wait to get her cardio dance DVD!!!!!",1245888000,2,1141,4.013215859030837
3562873,2,B001F2HZHI,"I'm not sure whether I am the best person to review this DVD or not due to the fact that Tracy recommends you do her workout 6x per week and I only do it once or twice per week.  She also says that in addition to her video, she wants you to do ""the cardio"" but doesn't give any specific cardio parameters (30min, 40min, intensity level, etc.)  I didn't find the leg series to be too challenging although I have yet to complete the arm series in its entirety (she has you basically holding your arms out for 10 minutes!)  Don't buy this DVD because you want Tracy's body, Gwyneth's body or Madonna's body because this DVD won't give you that.  Tracy and Gwyneth are small because they have small frames, their genetics, and probably their diet.  Madonna has her body because she lifts weights.  This DVD is great for breaking up a routine but not much else...
  The first section is for legs, you are standing behind a chair and doing various leg lifts with one leg for about 5-7 minutes, then you switch sides.  She has a floor leg section which isn't as challenging but the moves are very nontraditional and she gives minimal instructions.  The standing arm section is killer because it is so long (try holding your arms out to your sides for 10minutes and of course they are going to get tired!).  The standing abs section is a joke, all she does is dance basically (and pout at the camera) but she gives zero instruction on to how to do the moves and doesn't tell you when she is changing them - skip this section.  The floor abs section is better but is short and could have been developed more.  If you want abs, buy ""Weight Loss Pilates"".  Good luck!",1245801600,4,1656,4.386885245901639
3562874,5,B001F2HZHI,"I bought The Mat Workout after having Abdominal Surgery in April since I was not allowed to lift heavy weight. I fell in love with the workout and now also own Tracy's post - pregnancy routine as well.

I have always worked out with cardio and weights and I am in shape. I have noticed good results in my arms and abs for sure. But the most amazing difference is in my ""saddle bags!"" Even as a size 2 I could never get rid of those annoying saddle bags -- now they are just about gone!!!  I try to workout with either the mat routine or the post - pregnancy 4 times a week and do the abs sections on almost all days. Still do cardio and yoga.

Tracy does not give alot of instruction but I prefer this because if your going to do the tape 4 times a week - you don't need to listen to her say the same things over again.",1245715200,,819,3.9515151515151516
3562875,5,B001F2HZHI,I love this mat workout. I have only been doing it for about three weeks and I have already seen changes especially my arms. I have spent years with weights trying to get my arms toned but there has always been a residue of 'bingo' wings. This has dramatically lessened. I wish I had known about this workout years ago.,1245715200,,319,4.333333333333333
3562876,5,B001F2HZHI,"As a Pilates instructor who always is on the lookout for effective and creative workouts to cross-train, Tracy's Mat Workout delivers.  The body image she is trying to attain with her DVD is for long and lean muscles, never working with weights over 3 pounds.  Her ab work is innovative.  Downside? The spine needs to be stretched more at the end of the DVD, otherwise lower back muscles do feel tight.  There is less verbal cueing than other DVD's, so you really need to pay attention and watch her movements carefully. Other than that, still one of the best DVD's on the market.

3562877,5,B001F2HZHI,"I really think that people just want to hate Tracy Anderson. I don't know why.

I keep reading bad reviews when her videos are awesome! She DOESNT talk a lot throughout the workout - you have to look at the tv a lot and then within a week, you have the whole thing memorized anyway. Have you ever done a workout where the person just won't stop talking??  A million ""come on's"" and ""You can do its""? After a while, it gets annoying and you wish theyd just stop talking so you can listen to the music playing. Well, Tracy rarely talks and its awesome to just listen to the music - you know what you're doing.

I also see a lot of people talking about her 'standing ab' section. I wasn't convinced of that part at first either... and I'm still not. But then I look at HER ABS and I think, ""Um... yeah, i totally want those abs"" so if she tells me to slide my ribs around for a few minutes, I'll do it. I think you really have to concentrate on keeping your core pulled in on that part.

The arm section is seriously incredible!!! I cant believe it. I've had NO arm definition my entire life and now, I can totally see a difference - it hurts - bad - but one thing I've learned is that these '8 minute workouts' and 'no pain workouts' is really a waste of time. She works your arms but good :P

So I bought the dance video first and loved it - then about a week ago, I got the mat workout and love it too. I do BOTH six times a week. I didn't think I'd have the time but you really need to MAKE the time. Most people who say they don't have the time are allocating two hours a day to facebook and two hours a day to TV... you have the time, you're just using it wrong!!

I'm down 20 pounds in about two months with very MILD dieting and no supplements. I still eat hamburgers and fries - I still drink about 4 pepsis a week - I ate a box of goobers last night... I don't eat nothing but junk, but I do indulge when I really feel like it. I wonder what would happen if I DID diet hardcore... I'd probably be down a lot more than I am now - tracy is amazing, all the haters are going down!",1245369600,6,2084,3.9618138424821003
3562878,4,B001F2HZHI,"I really was not too sure about ordering this video.  I mean yes of course I want the boby of Madonna and Gwyneth, but seriously no women should lift greater than 3 lbs...give me a break.  But I love the workout.  It kicked my butt and I feel great.  I have to admit though that I plan to incorporate it with my weight lifting and cardio routines.  I want ""teeny tiny"" arms like she describes but I want strength and lean muscle also.  I have twins to pick up...And they weight more than 3lbs!!  She gives very little instruction.  Bad while learning the excercises but will be great later when you watch it over and over.  too much chatter gets old after a few weeks anyway. (think Denise Austin..yikes) It really isn't too hard to follow.  with that being said there are some points when you have your head down and she changes the movement without a word, especially during the warm up and cool down.  Watch it before doing it.  It will help.  I lack coordination so I am not interested in her Dance routine. I'll just stick to the treadmill thanks!",1245283200,,1052,4.38860103626943
3562879,3,B001F2HZHI,"I truely Loved Tracey's philosophy and exercise techniques. I however,
 did not enjoy her execution  of the movements. She did ot give lead in cues. I
constantly had to look at the video to see what was happening. Tracey did not
count did not give her student the next movement. If you are not looking at
the dvd you do not know what is going on. I am surprised and disappointed in
the lack of professionalism. I thought with Madonna and Gwenth undrwriting and\
supporting Tracey the dvd would be o0f higher professional quality. Tracey
has so much potential. She needs a director who has knowledge of exercise.

It is definately challenging my muscles in a whole new way which I love.  And I'm pretty sold on her concept of building the smaller accessory muscles instead of the larger ones that tend to make me feel bigger.  Also love her stomach workout.  In a month I've seem some huge changes.",1244332800,,438,4.216867469879518
3562883,5,B001F2HZHI,"My problem with with working out, is keeping up with it, and doing it as much as I should.  But I think tracy anderson's confidence in her method, makes you want to keep it up.  I love that she's tried all the different ways to work out- and has learned that the best moves for you, are hers.  It makes me want to keep doing this video- I have, and I do see results especially in my arms.

The music in the video is very fun.  She doesn't talk too much in the video (makes it difficult to know exactly how and where you should feel the moves burning) but it's also good because when you watch a video everyday for 5-6 days and begin to know the moves by heart, it's nice not to hear much talking.

My only down side is, after working this video a lot, I started to notice my joints were popping and cracking more than usual.  Normally my knee never pops and now it does often.  Or when I do the move where the knee comes up to the shoulder my hips pop.  It wasn't like this during the first week, and I'm a little uneasy about it, I'm only 22.  I wish I could ask her why that happens and if it goes away.

With that said I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone that has joint problems, it might be hard on the joints.  Other than that,  the video is fantastic",1244160000,5,1265,4.032128514056225
3562884,4,B001F2HZHI,"I love this workout; it's tough without being high impact on the joints and really helps tone the whole body while elevating the heart rate into the calorie burning zone.  I do take issue with the standing ab portion however.  Anderson's movements are too fast to really deeply isolate the abs, and she instead reverts to moving her knees, which will not get you the results you can expect from slower, more purposeful movements.  I personally perform upper ab isolations (left, right and up) a la belly dance at a slower pace than what she performs, and find it to be sufficient.

For new users with no dance experience I would recommend viewing the DVD at least twice before working out so you are familiar with the routine and positions, as there isn't much instruction.  A preview for those with dance experience is still recommended, but not necessary.

I would also recommend building up to a full 4-6 day routine prescribed by Anderson versus jumping into a heavy 4 day routine right away.  I started with 1lb weights and eventually moved to 2lb and then 3lb  when comfortable.  I also did the workout once a week, recovered (ouch!), then two workouts the second week etc until I was able to perform 4-5 workouts a week without being sore or uncomfortable the next morning.",1244160000,12,1280,4.7040358744394615
3562885,3,B001F2HZHI,"This exercise program is not for beginners. Clearly Tracy has a dance backround and this is where most of her moves come from. The standing leg work is barre work essentially. You must watch your lower back and not overextend it. She does not cue and it it's tough to know when she changes sides etc if your head is down below your knees!

The standing ab work gets boring after a couple of minutes(also dance inspired) and the mat ab work is short and she does not offer any alternate easier moves.

The arm section is a standout and your arms will be killing you but she is randomly changing sides and leg work and it's hard to know if you are just supposed to go with it or follow her moves exactly. She then immediately goes into a weighted arm workout.

Overall, I am feeling the hurt today but I think it would be tough to do this 4-6 days a week as she suggests. If you are trying to lose weight, you'll need to do cardio as well. This is strictly for toning.",1244073600,,966,4.182795698924731

After having a baby, and seeing Tracy and Gwenneth on Opra, i gave this a try. I really love the dvd, and im shocked! I can certainly see results in my arms already. I also have the Post Partum dvd, and the cardio dance, but vastly prefer this one. I like the music, and find her method of teaching is fine...some complain that she doesnt cue enough, but if you do the dvd enough, you will learn it anyways, and then there is no break down of the routines, which after i learn a video, just gets annoying to me anyways. I don't find Tracy to be ""pouty"" or what have you. Yes, it is challenging, but you will see something good happen to your body, so its worth the effort to me.",1243987200,3,891,4.0625

The stomach routine was the worst, it was so silly and not easy at all to follow.  Stomach exercises standing up and dancing around just don't work!! To conclude, don't waste your money, just beause she mentions Madonna or Gwen. Paltrow on her website.

Love all the different angles that she hits the legs with. Wish she would tape live classes so we could get a new dvd every few months or so!! Would love to know how to become an instructor and bring her method to the midwest!!,1243468800,,351,4.101449275362318
3562894,4,B001F2HZHI,"I gave this four stars because the workout is hard and fairly unusual - which is good.

okay, first the bad news: you will not get all the moves in this dvd the first time or even the first week. Mostly because Tracy doesn't speak much during this video, which for me is a downside, as i don't want to have to look at the screen. I am a yogi and workout a lot and there are some tricky moves and body angles in this video, she goes too fast and changes stuff up without saying anything. So basically, there is little to no ""sonic cues"" for you. It is all visual. I like her, so if she were talking more, it would not be irritating. Nor does she count at all. She also says that you should do her cardio dvd, which i've seen a clip on you tube and it looks even more fast and confusing. However, given how challenging the workout is, it seems - as a new user of this dvd - worth it to keep using it as the suggested 4-6 times a week to see results.

Now the good news: it is a challenge! and considering I've been working out for 20 years, this is exciting. moves I've never done. it is very ""dancy"" but super hard. I doubt anyone but a fitness instructor could get through this video with perfect form. The nice thing is that most of the moves are ""new"" or rather, not yoga or pilates. You will feel it. It is not a cheap video, so only buy it if a) you are willing to get used to it and learn it without as much instruction, b) you are ready to do it 4-6 times a week - you will see a result for sure, and c) you are wiling to feel sore and awkward in order to get a hot bod. I have only done it a few times and I am glad that I have it, even though there are some things that drive me coo-coo! I'll break down the workout for you:

Warm up = don't skip it, but funky
Standing Legs = a challenge! weird but effective leg rotations. you'll have to study it a bit.
Standing Abs = horrifying. no instructions, could not follow. hope to conquer someday.
Standing Arms, no weight = super duper challenging.
Standing Arms, 1-3lbs. weight = again challenging, but why are these right after the other arms?
Mat Legs = pretty good challenge, no inner thigh work though...
Mat abs = super challenging. basic but painful!
Cool down = like the warm up in reverse.

hopefully this will be helpful...buy it if you want a different sort of dancy mat workout. it is the cost of two yoga classes, so if you actually DO the dvd's you buy, then it is worth it....maybe her future videos will have more instruction?",1243382400,,2496,4.087755102040816

It really is fast and any thing you cant do at first be sure to know you will in 1 week's time - yes cues aren't a lot but u get to learn to count and moves yr self in no time!

I have just ordered her other 2 DVDs so will keep you posted to see what the combination does!  Oh also, amazingly, even my cellulite diminished - maybe from all the toning of my legs and butt!

3562896,5,B001F2HZHI,"I could probably go on and on about this video. I'm in my mid 20's and while I've always been able to get through a bootcamp class any day of the week, I've also been horribly lazy, unmotivated, and recently have seen my body lose its athletic shape and become soft. That's not cool with me. I've been hearing of Tracy Anderson for a while, but it wasn't until I did her short little routine that she made for Gwyneth Paltrow while on the road (check out [...]) that I realized I could start enjoying working out again.
I've always enjoyed lifting weights and feeling a healthy burn on my muscles, but this really is a different type of strength training. While I absolutely LOVE this DVD and have already begun to see and FEEL changes in my body (have only been doing this for 2 weeks, 3-4 times/week, along with jogging 3-4 times/week), I'll try to be as fair as possible with the Pros and Cons:
Cons:
* Definitely not a lot of cueing. It's 100% fine with me, I can just look at what she's doing and imitate her. In fact, now I mute the sound and put on my own workout playlist while I follow the visual.
* She changes up moves (especially in the arms section) fast and frequently, almost as if she were thinking of them on the spot. I think it's great because it doesn't get boring/repetitive, but I could see how some people might get frustrated.
* I'm not sure if this is a con, but I guess I would not recommend this DVD for a person who is highly inflexible, constantly has joint/back/etc pains, and/or simply has never really exercised before in their lives. This is a rigorous workout and for someone like my mom, for instance (has never really worked out in her life, is in her 60's and overweight), I would suggest going with something much lighter than this.

Pros:
* It's tough. I think this is a tough workout. Honestly, only now into week three can I actually hold weights while performing the second part of the arms section.
* It burns, but it's a different burn. This has never caused me major pain like I've had when working out at the gym before; the kind of pain that makes it hard to go up stairs or lift your arms fully. This workout will make you feel some soreness all around (really... ALL around) but not actual pain, because you will be able to do it again the next day.
* It's different. I've done the squats, the lunges, the curls, the lifts, everything. I do enjoy some of those exercises still, but this is very different. It's easy to get hooked and is a much welcomed change of pace.
* She doesn't talk much - I LOVE this. She's not annoying, she's not yelling at you, she's just doing the workout right there with you. She explains some of the reasons behind her method, and sympathizes at the *right* times (ie, ""I know that arm is KILLING you right now, but just stick through it""), but for the most part, she's quiet. And it's peaceful.
* It doesn't require much space at all. I live in a small studio apartment and this is perfect: you need just enough space to lay down a yoga mat. There is no impact at all, so you won't be bothering the downstairs neighbor, and you can take it anywhere with you (I brought it during Memorial Day weekend vacation with a yoga mat).

I honestly can't say enough good things. If you have decent coordination and are overall healthy, I highly recommend this. I hope she puts out another DVD soon with different combos/exercises. I feel great and I can see my body changing.",1243296000,12,3445,4.364485981308412

I am not big into mat workouts and have only taken a few Pilates classes, my main form of exercise is hula hooping. I'm 5'7 and 120 lbs and wanted a workout that toned and lifted my muscles, and this DVD is making it happen. I know that she doesn't give much instruction, but I thought the moves were easy to mimic and I love that she doesn't chatter the entire time. The minimal babble and chill soundtrack make it easy to watch the DVD over and over.

I have been doing this video 6 times a week for the past 2 1/2 weeks and I have already seen visible improvement (lifting, definition) in my rear end, abs and hips/love handle area. I have noticed that my heart rate stays up so there is a calorie burning benefit as well, which you might not get with more traditional Pilates.

However, it is not for beginners or people who are completely out of shape. This is a tough workout and close attention needs to be paid to the streching in the warm-up and cool-down, and to your exercising form throughout the repetitions.

Worth every penny and more!",1242691200,,1166,4.315068493150685
3562921,3,B001F2HZHI,"As other reviews say, Tracy does NOT cue well. While the actual exercises aren't overly difficult, she moves from exercise to exercise without telling you. So you'll be laying on the floor doing abs, getting into the move, and you glance at the tv and she's doing something totally different. I liked the standing legs and floor abs. The standing abs were ridiculous (I can't even try to describe what she was doing). The arm part was kind of weird- some moves were good but a lot was doing birdlike movements. My muscles weren't sore at all the next day.

Tracy needs to improve her cuing, motivation, add tougher exercises, maybe countdown- some moves you do lots of reps, others you do like 4 reps. You just never know where you're going with this dvd which makes it hard to enjoy. It just seems like something she threw together at the last minute. Also, there is no chapter selection option- so if I wanted to just do the abs, I have to FFwd through the whole dvd. Annoying.",1242691200,,979,4.5
3562922,1,B001F2HZHI,"Just got this dvd and was so dissapointed. I can't believe people actually buy this. Do you think your body will look like her when your done? You'd have to starve yourself along with doing the video. Talk about bad instruction! She's all over the place, it's like she making it up as she goes along and doesn't let you know when she's switching moves etc. I really don't think that she even targets the muscles she's aiming for. I've done plenty of workouts and I can feel when I'm working that muscle. Her arm exercises just kill my shoulder, that's all, even though she says it will get rid of the flab underarm (triceps). She not in my opinion any sort of fitness person to follow she should be modeling with all the poses she does throughout her video. If you want a good workout try Gilad's Bodies in Motion.",1242604800,5,814,4.397350993377484

3562924,5,B001F2HZHI,This is by far THE best workout i have ever done!!!!!There are not enough great things to say about Tracy Anderson and her method of getting in shape. Results come quick if you stick with it and do it at least 4 times a week. Its hard...yes...BUT its that hurt that feels good afterwards. I feel amazing after i do her workout! So worth the money. I have all three of her dvds and they are all wonderful. The post preg one is also awesome...whether you have had a child or not...Tracy Andersons workouts are worth ever penny!!!!!Anything she may come out with in the future...i most certainly will purchase!!!!,1242518400,2,610,4.554545454545455

I like that everything about it is simple. I also like that it's just her in her studio. I have the Biggest Loser DVD also, and I thought it would be so distracting that there were 2 other people with Jillian; but that's just me. I don't agree with the people who said she looked bored. I didn't get that from her at all. And I also like that she just jumps right into moves. After about 3 or 4 times, you can follow it exactly. The only thing I don't like is that there are no chapters and I can't fast forward. After I finished the DVD, I wanted to go back to do the ab part again, but I didn't want to sit there for 10 minutes to fast forward. Overall, a great, different, simple DVD.",1242345600,2,841,3.9529411764705884
3562965,4,B001F2HZHI,"I just got and did this workout yesterday. I'm 28 and yoga instructor. I really like Tracy's video which reminds me a lot of dance class mixed with aerobics (some moves) and Kundalini Yoga exercises. The video is not too long (I think around 45-50 mins) so I can do it twice in a day or at least squeeze in a day however I wish she had a little more narration to let you know that she has moved onto another exercise along with a different camera angle(like during the ab exercises) to show which way she is moving. But all in all, it's a nice change with some challenging control since she is changing it up a lot so you can't get used to the repetition. Add some ankle/wrist weights and this would be killer!! Would recommend for someone who wants to exercise/tone their body without all the equipment or time.",1242259200,2,812,4.348684210526316
3562966,2,B001F2HZHI,"I was extremely excited to get this dvd, and do like though it is not without its problems. The biggest problem is that Tracy doesn't give detailed instruction on the correct positioning required for the poses. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the camera angles are lousy, and shows her doing the excerices, from behind a chair! I am a yoga teacher and know how imperative it is to teach people correct positioning to avoid injury. Her uppper belly workout is far too advanced to teach without any instruction at all, but I think her leg exercises are easy enough to pick up. I also saw a separate video of her on YouTube where she says to up your repetitions to about 100 a day of each exercise. There is NO mention of this in the dvd. It's almost as if she's trying NOT to really let you in on her secret method.",1242259200,4,826,4.335483870967742

I didn't feel very sore in the legs after this one, which is usually how I know that my legs got really worked.  Can't speak for the arm section because I didn't use weights (all of the talk about the soreness in the arms kinda scared me away)!

I don't agree that anything over 3 lbs. makes your muscles bulk. I certainly don't think Madonna and Gwyneth got their lean bodies from this video alone. I think it is unrealistic you are going to do this 6 times a week because your muscles need to rest. If you workout alot this alone will not challenge you. The arms were good and the ab work was different. It is a good substitute vidoe. Not sure it was worth the $$$$.,1241654400,,546,4.20952380952381

3562975,2,B001F2HZHI,"I'll let you know how I liked this video when my back stops hurting (3 weeks so far).  I don't consider myself really fit or unfit. I ran for 25 years and now (due to running injuries) currently walk or use my versa climber a minimum of 3 times a week, so I didn't think I could injure myself so badly when I only did about one fourth of the repetitions performed in the video.

True it was not the usual exercise video with an annoying, yet effervescent instructor who never stops talking, but I think Tracy went a little too far in the other direction.  There is little discussion of which muscle group is being worked with each exercise and not much direction on proper execution.

I do however, think this may really work if you can get to the point where you can even partially keep up with Tracy.  My pain was in the small of my back right in the spot where your dimples are if you have them.  I know I'm not the only person who has had this reaction to the video because I read a review by someone else who had the exact same problem.

Word of warning, when first starting this video TAKE IT SLOWLY!!!!

I only gave this 2 stars because I don't think any reasonably fit person should not get hurt so badly from the first light run through of this video!",1241654400,11,1260,4.199170124481328

3562981,5,B001F2HZHI,"I ordered The Tracy Anderson Mat Workout after hearing all the hoop-la surrounding her training methods with Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna. I definitely wasn't expecting much from this video, especially after hearing she doesn't recommend lifting anything over 3lbs, but boy was I wrong. Tracy Anderson specializes in toning and shaping your body, rather than piling on muscle. She wants her clients to have a 'dancer's body' with long and lean muscles.
Her Mat Workout may be a little unorthodox as it seems to be a one-woman show you are watching: not a lot of interaction with the camera, she's quiet and doesn't need to yell at the camera to get her points across.
All you need for this workout is 3lb weights, a chair (any chair will do), and a yoga mat.
The workout is about 60 minutes and she focuses a lot of the smaller muscle groups. I was exhausted after this workout...and sore, but a different kind of sore. I wasn't in pain but more like a muscle fatigue.
She definitely knows what she is doing and I felt longer and leaner, even after one workout.

She changes positions and exercises often without saying anything, so if you are looking anywhere but the screen at ALL times (hard to do in many positions), you won't see that she's changed positions again.  She also fails to explain what exactly she is doing when she takes up new positions.  Most video instructors spell out how your body should be positioned, but she does not.

She seems to get lost in her own world of dance moves toward the end, so it's hard to follow, even for someone who used to dance often.

In short, the workout seems to be a good one, but you have to go through it several times to figure out just what you should be doing and when.",1240617600,,903,4.403614457831325

She seems bored and appears to roll her eyes during the workout.  She discourages users from doing any other exercises other than her dvds in order to achieve results.  I like to run and do other things so I didn't like the idea of limiting my activities.  After doing it four times, I tried to motivate myself by doing it to different music, but after that, I lost interest.  I could see a difference in my shoulders, but my arms never felt sore like Gweneth Paltrow talks about.

I like the workout designed by Jennifer Aniston's personal trainer, Mandy Ingber.  She uses yoga.  In the past I was hesitant to do yoga, because I thought it wouldn't give me a good workout, but I learned it really does and it feels good.  Mandy Ingber and Jennifer Aniston did an interview together for Self Magazine which is available on Mandy Ingber's site under ""press releases"", along with a video she did demonstrating the workout.

Tracy is informative, but NOT chatty at all. I actually really like that about the video.

You must fast forward thru each time to get to the segment you want. Also, her instruction is so limited, you must watch her every second to know when she makes any change, because she never tells you a count for any of the movements.

3563010,5,B001F2HZHI,"I learned about Tracy Anderson through Goop and I immediately ordered the mat dvd since it seemed exactely what I was looking for. And: I love it.
I have been doing the whole session every day now for two weeks and I already can see my body changing.
- It's a full body workout, Tracy also adresses muscles that are usually negelcted and thus avoiding the ""bulky muscle effect"" that does not look good on women, I already am leaner without dieting
- Tracy's background as a dancer is also showing in the mat dvd and makes the workout more dynamic and fun and therefore easier to stick to it
- Tracy has a very lovely personality which is important since you are supposed to do the dvd 5-6 times a week
- The workout is challenging but do-able; probabely it's a bit hard at the beginning for women who have never worked out before
- The production quality is excellent (setting, camera, light etc), the only thing missing are chapters within the workout session
- The dvd should be combined with some kind of cardio training
- You need three-pound weights for the arm training
With this dvd transforming your body is definitely fun, particularly as results come really fast!",1239321600,3,1173,4.563981042654029

FACTS:
Lost 2 inches off my bust, waist and hips in 1 month of doing this combined with the cardio 6-7 days a week as she recommends. I was also restricting my diet to 1200 calories a day and eating only fruits, vegetables and nuts.

If you need to drop weight fast, Tracy will do that for you! She is incredible.",1238976000,2,381,4.0131578947368425
3563013,5,B001F2HZHI,"therefore I can write an informed review. Please don't write reviews when you've only done the DVD once! It doesn't make sense!
That said, I've been doing this DVD and the Post Pregnancy DVD for the past 3 months, 4-6 times a week as Tracy recommends. The results are truly amazing, but it comes with a lot of hard work. The first week or so I was so sore- I never have been that sore in my whole life and I've been working out forever. It's the most motivating DVD I've done because Tracy's figure is ideal to me- fit yet very feminine. Plus, Gwyneth is GORGEOUS. In the Post Pregnancy DVD she uses classical music and focuses on the abs more, which I love. I hate the techno stuff in most workout DVDs. A lot of reviewers complain that she doesn't instruct enough- that's a plus for me. It doesn't get irritating and after a couple of times you get the hang of it anyway. I can't stand all of the motivational blather most workout girls do. She's very quiet- I love that. Her arm series are probably her strongest area. They are exhausting and most workout DVDs don't emphasize arms enough. Her warm ups/cool downs are her weakest areas- seems like she's just doing any old thing, but who cares? It's the workout that counts and she is amazing. I've trimmed down SO much and notice such a difference in my post-pregnancy belly (I've had an 11 pound baby and then twins- so my poor tummy has been through hell.) The Mat DVD is still a great workout but I don't tend to go to it as much just because the music is ultra cheesy and Tracy pouts and tries to act super sexy in it which can drive me crazy. I'm going to try the Cardio Dance DVD next- I've heard that ones hard to follow but I trust Tracy and will do whatever she tells me! She knows what she's doing!",1238976000,9,1762,4.262686567164179

3563015,5,B001F2HZHI,"This TA Mat Workout DVD is like no other home workout I have come across.  Before purchased, I did my research and read all the reviews, went on different sites, asked people I know if they heard of her.  Like all new workout DVD's I watched it full length first so I know what I was getting into.  She does recommend doing this video 4-6 times a week but personally for me, my workout experience is always trying to push myself for that last 3rd day of the week and that's it for me.  So that's what I stuck to, the first week I didn't feel any muscle soar like many reviewers had experienced but I did feel my muscle movements sometimes when I would move regularly.  Well after working out with this video for just 3 weeks doing it only 3 times a week, I couldn't believe the definition in my arms, legs, the slimmer waist and fat i've shed on my back area (you know that nasty chubby fat some of us see on our lower back area).  I am in my 30's, and have thick thighs flabby arms and like many of us a stomach, I needed to loose about 20-30lbs so before I came across the TA workout I did toning workouts with 5lb weights and as a result I started to see my arms toning but the problem I had was that they were getting bulky and toned instead of sexy, sleek and toned.  I'm so happy I decided to purchase the TA Mat Workout DVD because now I'm starting to see my body transforming into one I never thought possible. It has only been 3 weeks since I've been using Tracy's method and everytime I look in the mirrow now it motivates me more to want to do it consistantly.  I love this workout because everytime I get lazy to want to get my workout in for the day, I put the DVD in and the music, the atmosphere of the workout and the moves itself pushes me to want to do it, yes she doesn't instruct much verbally but it doesn't bother me because I'm paying attention to her moves anyway. I like her method because her moves are easy but she give alot of reps that make you feel the workout and work your muscles and that's what you want.  I like that each segment goes by pretty quick, the 1 hour is over before you know it and you feel great in the end.  She also recommends her Dance workout DVD which I have done some research so far and found it to be toucher and more time consuming but I am willing to give it a try if I know i'll have a better body as a result.  Thank you.",1238889600,8,2381,4.04468085106383

Though she doesn't explicitly direct on movement, it made me pay attention to her more in the beginning so I can make sure that my movements were perfect.  As for the flair and the dancing--I love it.  I've shared this DVD with all the girls in my college class and they love it.",1238889600,,429,4.132530120481928
3563017,5,B001F2HZHI,"I bought this in the hopes it would change my overweight flabby body into Tracy Anderson's body.  Well I think it will take more than a week, but in this first week (I did it almost every day)I can already see a big difference.  It is a ton of different exercises done in certain patterns to reshape the body.  And OUCH!  This one hurts and I still can't do it all in the order she does. I have to do the legs fast forward to the arms, then back to the legs, then abs, then arms, etc.  Some day I'll be able to do the whole thing from start to finish in the order it is suppose to be, that will probably be the day I look like Tracy.  Overall it is a great workout, my legs, butt, love handles, stomach, and arms have all gotten smaller and more toned.  My arms hardly flap in the breeze anymore!  I highly recommend it, just be prepared to be in pain and I usually end up yelling at Tracy as if she could really hear me through the TV but it helps me get through it!  Enjoy the pain, it gets results!",1238803200,,1001,3.965
3563018,2,B001F2HZHI,"This is possibly the worst workout video I have ever done.

Throughout most of the video she gives little to no instruction, with the exceptions of things like ""everything should be done with power"" and ""everything should be really alive, nothing should be dead"".

- In the warm-up section, she moves with the music and she doesn't give directions, so you don't know what's part of the move and what's her own expression of the movement. Also, she moves though the stretches at lighting speed, holding them no more than 5-6 seconds instead of the recommended 30, and she moves to the next stretch/move without giving you any warning, so if you are looking down like she is, you won't see her moving. I thought: ""ok, I'll just do my own warm up"" and then do the rest, but it doesn't get better:
- The first leg section includes good moves, but it's nothing you won't find in a number of other The Firm or any number of barre-inspired workout like Squeeze, Cardio Barre, etc. She gives no pointers on the position of the standing leg or protecting your knees.
- In the ""standing abs"" section she gives NO instruction. She just tells you to do what she is doing, which is moving her torso in different directions at the pace of the music, but she gives no pointed of keeping your core tight, breathing, protecting your lower back, leaving your shoulders down, nothing. You just have to try to keep up. If you do, you will notice that you aren't working your abs that much, and as far as ab work you could accomplish more by paying the Hula Hoop on the Wii Fit.
- In the unweighted arm section, again, she gives very little direction, you just have to imitate her. The movements are awkward and better cueing (or any, really) is really needed, along with any hint of which muscle you should feel it in so you can visualize... neither of which are provided.
- The weighted arm section is simply unsafe. She said everything should be really controlled, but that's the extent of her instruction throughout the section. She moves quickly in different angles and overextends her joints, both of which are really unsafe practices, especially when holding weights, even if it is as low as 3 pounds.
- The second leg section contains some good moves, but again she gives no tips on avoiding momentum, relaxing your shoulders or using your core to protect your back. The moves themselves are nothing new really, they can be found in Pilates videos, Squeeze and some even in old videos like Denise Austin's Butt, Legs and Thighs.
- The ab section is good, probably the best of the whole workout - however it's again nothing new, I have done the same exercise in videos from The Firm, Kari Anderson's Tone it Up!, David Kirsch.
Also, because the video is not divided in chapters, you will have to fast forward through the whole video to get to the abs - or any section towards the end, really.

I would absolutely NOT recommend this video. The poor cueing alone can be really frustrating, but the lack of instruction and the unsafe moves is really what makes it actually a poor example of a workout video.

If you want a video that hits those trouble spots but has good instruction and good cueing I would recommend Tracy Effinger's Squeeze, Pure Barre or even Cardio Barre, which includes also cardio in addition to muscle work.",1238803200,8,3314,4.583473861720067
3563019,4,B001F2HZHI,"I enjoy the workout. It is very challenging, especially
The standing leg workout. I'm still struggling with the leg workout, but it's getting better.
It will be about a month, since I started this workout, and I can already see positive results.
You'll need to stick with it to see a real change in your body.
The arm workout is challenging as well, I personally love it.
At the beginning it really hurts, since you're using the accesorie muscles.
It will take a few times to get used to it. Once you get used to it, it
Gets better. Not for beginners I would say to must be mid way fit to be able to

3563020,4,B001F2HZHI,"I was so excited when I had this workout waiting in my mailbox last night, so excited in fact, that I got up early just to try the workout. What I found was not what I had expected. For someone who claims that their method is unique and uncoventional, I would expect the entire workout to incorporate moves that I'd never seen before. I'll give her the arm sequence: it was killer and completely different than anything I had done before. As for the legs and abs segments, it's just isometrics. Nothing terribly unique or new about that. In addition to not being completely revolutionary, I was disappointed by the lack of instruction, and apparent lack of enthusiasm on her part. She seemed really bored.... One last gripe: she needs to learn how to cue. If you're going to change moves, let me know. I'm sure that I'll appreciate her lack of instruction/cueing once I do the workout a few more times, but just learning it would have been nice to have more instruction.

The last thing that I want to say, is that as annoyed as I was by this workout, I really did enjoy it. My abs are killing me, my arms hurt...I have pretty strong legs, so those aren't sore (yet). I will definintely be doing this workout again, and as I learn it, maybe I'll appreciate the intially apparent defects.",1238630400,7,1287,4.5
3563021,4,B001F2HZHI,"Finally a good workout DVD that is simple but surprisingly challenging. I could not complete the entire workout the first few times I did it, but it gets easier if you stick with it. Even my athletic daughter struggled to get thru the first time. You will definitely feel it in your arms and thighs after doing these exercises! The only equipment you need is a mat (or towel), chair, and small weights. The only negative is that Tracy Anderson does not do a good job of vocalizing the movements, it relies on visual, so when you are in a position that you can't see the TV, it's hard to know when to change position. Eventually you learn the moves, so I still rate it highly.",1238630400,,675,4.365079365079365

As soon as I received the DVD and tried it out, I have been hooked ever since. Her arm workout is very similar to Kundalini yoga and does build strength and form almost immediately if you can work through it regularly and hang on. Start out doing as much as you can than gradually you'll gain the strength to follow a complete sequence without stopping. I'm going to try out her Dance Workout DVD next and check out her studio here in L.A. to see if doing an actual class will be just as or even more beneficial.",1238544000,,620,4.3076923076923075

I really enjoy this workout.  She focuses mainly on the legs and the arms and it's very challenging.  I can't do the entire arm section yet, and I can feel my muscles burning while I do it.
She doesn't do any cardio work during this session, so I would recommend doing some to warm up before starting.  Her cuing on the ab section isn't great, but this isn't really an ab workout anyway.  I'd recommend getting the PP workout for great ab exercises.  Someone must have told her to work on her cuing, because it's much better on that DVD.
Other than that though, this is a great workout.  Enjoy!",1238371200,,733,4.385185185185185

The problem that I have with this workout is the fact she goes right into another position WITHOUT TELLING YOU!!! Are you kidding me????? You don't count while you are doing it, and if I am supposed to be doing these correctly then I should not be looking at the TV set. Tracy just does what she wants like I have been working out with her for years.  It is almost like she hates the cameras. It aggravates the hell out of me she does not talk you through the video enough.

I was surprised at how challenging this video is - I did not think 3 pound weights would be hard since I had been lifting much heavier weights.  There are alot of dance elements to this routine so if you are uncomfortable with that you might not like it.  The lack of instruction and cueing can be frustrating at first, but once you have done it a few times it is fine. In fact it is preferable.

Tracy does not give instructions most of the time, without telling you she changes positions, she does not give instructions on how to do the exercises properly so you do not know if you are doing it effectively, she is very quiet, has no personality and does not motivate at all, when she tries to motivate it sounds very fake.

She goes into a segment where she moves her ribcage around, she does this for awhile and just says to follow along, you have no idea what shes doing and she doesn't tell you. It looks silly and you have to stop and laugh. A waste of time.

The arm segment is ok, the part where she stretches the arms is hard to do, I got through the whole thing, but honestly lifitng weights on the arms is much better exercise.

The work she does on the floor is hard to follow because the way its shot you can't see what shes doing.

Then she brags how this took her 8 years of research to put together, etc, her workout seems like a scam to me. Theres no way you would get in shape with this workout. Maybe if you never exercised before.
Hard to believe she is Madonna and Gwenthys trainer.

Waste of time and money!!. If you want a good workout go with the 30 day shred by Jillian Michaels, who is a professional",1237420800,10,1446,4.146428571428571
3563043,5,B001F2HZHI,"Like everyone else I saw Tracy on Oprah! I ordered the Mat Workout after reading other reviews. My arms are now teeny tiny and I have NEVER had small arms EVER! It's not hard to do and I like that all the leg work is done while standing and holding onto the back of a chair - these are exercises usually done on all fours and usually KILL my knees. The arm workout is KILLER! After one week of the Mat Workout, I noticed these two 'dimples' on either side below my belly button. My husband said it looks like your belly is getting smaller along with your waist, so I went to my computer and ordered Tracy's cardio dance routine. I now do both of them every morning - takes a TOTAL of 1 hour and 40 minutes. The cardio is much harder as others have reviewed (which kept me from buying it when I bought the Mat Workout) but I knew I would get better results if I did both. There are 8 songs so I concentrated on learning one dance routine a day and now I can do all 8. I start really sweating after the 3rd song. I own all the exercise DVDs - Ab Jam, Core Dancing, Biggest Loser - but it was Tracy who CHANGED MY BODY to a much smaller form!",1237420800,12,1139,4.0
3563044,4,B001F2HZHI,"As a fitness professional, always wanting to learn new ideas, I was very skeptical to get this video, simply because of the negative reveiws.  But I decided to give it a try just because I was curious.  I must say, that it was a great workout to target those little muscles we often leave out as trainers in a gym.  My only complaint is that her cueing, especially during the warm-up, is horrible.  You just have to watch the screen to know what you are doing.  Would I recommend it?  Yes",1237420800,,488,4.3076923076923075
3563045,4,B001F2HZHI,I really liked this video.  It is challenging and fun and keeps you interested.  The moves are new and different and that makes it fun and hard at the same time.  I wish it was a little shorter as I have a hard time finding the time to get in the one hour with two little girls but it is a really good workout.,1237420800,,310,3.8125
3563046,5,B001F2HZHI,This mat exercise is awesome.  It will kick your butt!  It may take awhile to complete the entire DVD.  It works as long as you are committed to working out every other day.  It is a high endurance routine and may take a few days of working thru it little by little to get thru the entire workout. I do recommend this product.,1237420800,,326,4.126984126984127
3563047,5,B001F2HZHI,"I'm new to this DVD and I love it.  Lots of variety. Tracy gives us detailed instruction and explains how she invented this method to help herself.  She found that it will help anyone who is willing to do the work.  We also have an interview with Gwyneth Paltrow to inspire us.
I'm 83 and I think it's working.  Thank you, Tracy !

3563048,5,B001F2HZHI,I really like this work out.  It's definitely hard though.  I've been doing it 3 days a week for about 3 weeks and I'm definitely stronger and each time I do it the exercises are a little easier and I don't have to stop and rest as often.  She (Tracy) recommends doing it 6 days a week but it's definitely too hard for me to do it that often but maybe once I get stronger and better at it I'll do it more.  I think 3 days a week is a good start for anyone.  It's definitely a different kind of work out and it makes you feel like your dancing so it's kind of fun (almost!).  I also got the cardio dance workout which is much harder for me just because I'm not very coordinated and it's taking longer for me to pick up the steps so I mostly still use my treadmill for cardio.,1237248000,,774,3.9294871794871793
3563049,1,B001F2HZHI,"Really, all I can say is I still haven't gotten through the first 3 standing leg exercises because it's not motivating and very boring. Overall, I'm sure the excercises are beneficial, but, Tracy does nothing to rev up energy and motivate you to finish.  Also, there are times where she goes into a new position and doesn't tell you what she's doing.  She obviously has a dancing background, but she presents the exercises as if you know what and how to do it already.  Also, some of the stretches are definitely for a more advanced group, but that's never mentioned, so hopefully nobody hurts themselves trying them at home.  If I can ever get through the whole program without falling asleep, I'll put my own music to the moves.",1237248000,6,730,4.635658914728682
3563050,4,B001F2HZHI,"This womens workout philosophy is new and fresh, but I feel it could have been filmed better. There are no cues between each new move. You have to do it a few times to learn it. I feel for the money it could have been produced better. I also don't like her ballet/ dance stance she is always in. I am not a dancer and she does not explain how to do the stances or wierd arm moves.",1237161600,,380,3.8846153846153846
3563051,3,B001F2HZHI,The good... exercises are challenging (arm section is a killer!) and you feel like you are definitely working if you do them correctly.  The bad... Tracy is not the best teacher.  There are large periods of time where she says nothing and with many of the exercises she doesn't really explain how to do them or what you should be feeling.  She also doesn't give any reminder cues (i.e. keep abs pulled in or specific cues to the movement).  It's basically follow the leader and if you have a background in dance or pilates you'll fare better.  The standing abs section is particularly difficult to master without any real teaching help from Tracy.,1237161600,,647,4.6902654867256635

I will purchase her cardio workout DVD next.,1237161600,,303,4.490909090909091
3563053,4,B001F2HZHI,"I am loving this DVD.  I have been doing it along with my active lifestyle 4 or 5 times a week for about three weeks now and have seen some major improvements in some old trouble spots.  Her arm section is amazing.  This DVD is not for the faint of heart, it's a lot of workout but it gets easier the more you do it.  She has a unique approach to body sculpting and fitness that would be helpful to anyone interested.  You get a much more lean/evenly muscled body than with other work outs where you are only working a few muscles.  She has a dance sensibility that I think is fun.  Speaking as a yoga instructor that has done a lot of pilates and traditional cardio/mat/weights workouts I felt like a learned a lot from Tracy Anderson and my body is looking more amazing than I thought it could.  Thanks for the fine tuning Tracy!",1237161600,4,831,4.248407643312102
3563054,2,B001F2HZHI,"I can't really say whether this workout will give you the results Tracy claims it will -- she says you will get ""amazing"" results if you do it 4-6 times per week.  Honestly, I think it is too boring to do that frequently.  It basically consists of a million leg lifts and a bunch of arm circles and an ok core workout.  While the leg lifts will tire your leg muscles out, I think this workout is overall too long for the results, I did not feel much of a burn after doing it or the next day.  I also prefer toning exercises that have some cardio component tied in (like Amy Dixon's dvds for Women's Health or vinyasa yoga).  This does not provide that, you will not breath heavily the entire time if you are in decent shape.

Tracy is not annoying, which is definitely a plus in exercise DVDs, but she also does not provide much instruction or discussion at all.  Considering that this is kind of an unusual program, I think a little more instruction and discussion would have been appropriate.

In summary, this DVD seems fine as something that is part of a rotation, and I might incorporate some of Tracy's varieties of leg lifts into other routines, but overall, this tape is only ok, and it is a big time commitment for something that does not provide a complete workout (i.e., no cardio).",1237075200,6,1293,4.4033613445378155

Never again.",1236902400,4,146,3.59375
3563056,4,B001F2HZHI,"This workout is definately in a category of its own. If the word dancing scares you, I don't recommend this. This isn't for those who are cue dependent - several times I realized Tracy had moved on to another move.  Tracy doesn't describe the movements in anyway that would help those doing this workout for the first time.  She does hit smaller muscles that most workout dvd's don't focus on, which is why I really like this.

The arm workout is unreal! I recommend this DVD to anyone whose major problem area is arms.  I've struggled with my arms since junior high - never able to achieve sleek, defined arms...just bulk. Do this workout and you will feel the burn and see the results!

The standing ab section is best described in the background music that plays while Tracy does this section... ""crazy"".  It is about impossible to follow her movement. I just improvised and am hopeful that one day I will mirror her movements =)

Tracy is focused on not building bulk, and puts down ""traditional"" forms of fitness. Her views on body shape imply that having muscle is a bad thing.  The long lean look is what she is all about, which is why she recommends only doing her mat method and dance cardio. I don't agree with her on this.

Both of her DVDs are great ADDITIONS to anyones workout because they do target different muscles and offer a nice change of pace.",1236816000,,1364,4.512195121951219

3563059,4,B001F2HZHI,It is worth buying this if you want to tone your legs and arms. And unlike the first (dancing) DVD by Tracy it doesn't require masses of space to do it in. You will only need a chair and some small hand weights. I find the workout rather unconventional but worth a go. I've only been doing it for a couple of weeks but i do feel it is making a difference especially to my legs which feel trimmer. I'm really going to stick with it for a few months because I do believe it will help me to shape up.,1236729600,,497,3.9306930693069306
3563060,5,B001F2HZHI,"I just received the `Mat Workout' last week and I love it. I know that with her fitness level, that I can't keep up 100% on my first few times of working out to the DVD but it's a nice goal to set myself up for.

I have to agree that, Tracy needs to breakdown some of the exercise moves, even if there was a special chapter to explaining the exercises. Also with the chest slides, she needs to say when she's changing directions because the front view does no not help with figuring out what direction she is sliding her chest.

Other then tweaking what's mentioned above, I love the DVD. I hope that with using it 2-3 times a week along with my other exercise classes at the gym, I'll notice some nice changes in my body.

Thank you Tracy for sharing your workout that the mega stars pay a fortune to have a private session with you. I fee like I have my own personal workout with you any time of day at my own convenience & without the mega cost of a personal trainer.

I hope you come out with more DVD's!!!!!!",1236729600,,1013,4.153061224489796
3563061,1,B001F2HZHI,"This video is certainly for advanced DANCERS!  Tracy provides so little instruction that it is just frustrating.  You just have to keep up, she give no instruction on how to position you body-it is left to you to try to figure it out.  She is very dull and seems bored.  Her expression rarely changes at all during the entire boring DVD.  If you are not a dancer, don't get this DVD.  It would be fine if she actually taught you how to dance and do the moves but she doesn't.  This is by far the worst workout video I have ever purchased.  If you are looking for motivation or inspiration any way, this is not for you.",1236643200,14,618,4.222222222222222
3563062,4,B001F2HZHI,"...then you will like and appreciate this DVD.

I was a semi pro ballerina for a long time (eons ago), and our daily barre work was much like Tracy's ""chair"" work.  I can tell you that if you stick with this, it really will work.  It takes time and repetition - just as ballet is a very disciplined sport, so is working through this DVD.

The arms are the same way.  It's amazing how painful that burn gets even without weights!  It's the repetition again.  In a lot of ways the arms were similar to ballet movements as well.

The hardest part for me was understanding the standing abdominal work.  The first part is easy, but when she switches it up it gets a bit confusing and hard to follow.  But by watching / doing the DVD several times I am certain it will come.

I received the DVD yesterday and used it when I got home from work.  Don't remember the length, but it wasn't overly long or overly short.  I can tell you that my butt and hips were KILLING me last night before bed, and while I assumed my arms would hurt too, they actually stopped hurting when I stopped the arm exercises.  Maybe my arms were in better shape than I thought.

Anyway, coming from a woman who is extremely active - I am a runner and I work out in some form or fashion 5 days per week - I can tell you that this DVD definitely worked some areas I wasn't working.  It really will work IF YOU STICK WITH IT.  Certainly, there is no cardio, so it's for shaping and toning only.  If you aren't already slim this won't get you there.  Only cardio and proper diet can do that.  But this absolutely will get your muscles in great shape.  It will tighten, tone and strengthen.",1236643200,14,1653,4.217252396166134
3563063,4,B001F2HZHI,"I really like doing this video.  However, the only problem is that Tracy just does the movies; she never lets you know when there is going to be a switch in arm exercise or something.  Also, there isn't a lot of explanation to make sure you are doing it right.  She has a great program but does a bad job of ""coaching"".  When you are doing the stretches (facing the floor) she doesn't indicate when she has come back up.  It is that type of stuff that makes it difficult to use.  However, it really does work muscles one doesn't realize they have.",1236470400,,547,4.262135922330097
3563064,2,B001F2HZHI,"I have had this video for over 2 weeks and it is so hard to get the hang of this, nearly impossible. Tracy and her supporters gave me such high hopes for it but there is literally no instruction with the moves and she doesn't give you any idea that she is moving onto another move until she is already into it. It is annoying and extremely hard to get your body into the propper alignment with no instruction on what (or why) she is doing a particular move. I would not recomend this DVD to anyone, which is a shame. It is too bad that I don't have bookoo bucks to pay Tracy to be my trainer, then I can see someone getting results, because she would actually be there SHOWING you exactly. But NOT with her dvds. I really don't know why everyone is giving these such good ratings. It is not deserved. Sorry, Tracy, please make a new DVD where you can take your TIME and TEACH!

I've only done this workout 5 times and I already feel stronger and can see positive changes in my body shape. (I've lost an inch off my waist already!!)
The first time I did it, I thought I would never complete it without stopping... it's a hard workout for a beginner. But by the 5th time, I was able to complete every sequence without resting (or screaming in agony!) I haven't progressed up to the 3 lb weights she recommends, but I'm sure I will in a month or so.
As difficult as it is, I actually look forward to doing it because of the results I'm seeing already.
Tracy's manner is quiet, but I like that. There's nothing worse than watching a workout dvd with so much talking you have to hear the same stupid comments every day. My only complaint is that you have to watch the screeen constantly, as she doesn't tell you when she changes a movement, but I'll get used to it the more I do it.

I am a fit person but at 5'2"" I bulk up really easily whenever I weight train. I've always just had to stick with cardio if I want to lose weight, but still it never keeps me very toned. My wedding is in 3 months, and my problem area is my arms, so I figured I'd give it a shot and purchased the DVD. It's my only workout DVD that I own and in 2 weeks, I've received more compliments on my figure than I could have imagined. I noticed that I'm leaner in the mirror, and my shoulders have more definition, but I didn't think it was noticeable to anyone else. The feedback has been very encouraging, and the results are pretty amazing. I do the workout 5-6 times a week first thing in the morning. At first, my form wasn't very good... the leg and arm workouts are brutal. But after a week, I noticed that I'm able to control more, and really get into it. For the first time this morning I actually completed the arm workout without stopping, which was a huge accomplishment for me. There are some annoying things that she does, like not really count or keep track of how many reps she does, and one side may get a few more reps than the other. So I have just learned to alternate... one day I start with my left, and the next it's my right, so hopefully that evens out. I would recommend this workout DVD for anyone who is really looking to tone up without bulking. I would not say it's the only form of exercise you need to lose weight, you still need to do cardio and eat well, but I'm pretty sure you'll be amazed with the results in a short time.",1236038400,13,1684,4.184615384615385

You wouldn't think that only using 3 pound weights would make you burn but when you get to the second arm workout where you actually use the weights, you are begging for one pounders or no pounders at all.  This workout is different and will definitely become an essential part of my weekly routine along with the Fit Channel's Namaste Yoga and Bodies in Motion with Gilad.  I like to keep it interesting.  This mat dvd is definitely working and waking parts of my body that I haven't used in a very long time.  And my arms do appear smaller!

3563069,5,B001F2HZHI,"I believe the previous reviews were extensive and I will not rehash what has already been said...for the most part :-)  I did the workout for the first time and right now my body feels like jello.  I really believe this workout is for all fitness levels but for those who have never worked out before or have been on a long hiatus you may have to reduce the reps or slow down some of the reps so that you don't tire quickly and come to a dead stop.  I probably own the worlds largest home dvd workout collection. I have everything from Turbo Jam to Tae Bo to Yoga Booty Ballet to Hip Hop Abs to numerous Yoga/Pilate tapes, Slim in 6, P90 etc. etc. etc. B/c of that I think I truly appreciate the less is more approach when it comes to chatty instructors.  It may be frustrating to some that Tracy does not talk a whole lot or she doesn't cue for every movement but I certainly prefer being able to listen to the music after doing the workout 4, 5, 6+ times than to listen to the same tired, corny remarks from the instructor.  GIVE IT TIME! I found that with most of her moves she actually did it in a particular sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1...etc.  once you catch on to that you won't need to be cued for every move. But regardless some people (as has been made evident by some of the reviews) need/want more direction and you certainly will not find it in this dvd.  I will also note that Tracy gives minimal advice for posture and technique.  The one thing to remember with a workout like this is it's not static, it is fluid. No part of your body should ever be locked even if it is not moving. The music in the workout is great! I actually loved it (for those who are interested on the back of the dvd box it tells you where you can go to get more info about the artist)! The only things you need for this workout are 1 to 3 pound weights, a mat, a dining room chair, water and a towel. You will sweat and YOU WILL BURN! Seriously! I will try to report back in about a month to update on my progress... although my workout routine contains alot of variety so it may not be useful now that I think of it....Oh another nuance...although the DVD is called 'mat workout' you seriously spend about 10-15 mins out of 57 mins on the mat so the title is a little misleading but I would not trade my DVD in for the world.

For example during her standing abs she moves side to side then back to front then all around without a word.  There didn't seem to be a count of any kind . I pretty much had to watch her dance in place.  Maybe once I learn her routine I will like it better.  It take a long time to do her mat work and I've had better workouts, targeting the same muscle groups, doing yoga. It's not worth the money.",1235865600,3,617,4.247863247863248

3563074,4,B001F2HZHI,"By now I am sure everyone has heard about TA's workout philosophy, so I won't reiterate here. What I will share is my experience of the using the DVD.
Pros:
Definitely a good full body workout

Cons:
This workout is geared towards people who can do the entire workout with the expectation that we do it 4-6x per week. There is no mention of ""working up"" to completing all the reps, or building up to being able to do it EVERYDAY. Which lets face it- a very small percentage of people purchasing this DVD will fit into this category. This is not for the beginner AT ALL. I am in good shape with both strength and cardio and this was a challenge for me. She offers No modifications.

Not enough verbal direction of the moves, which is to me a serious flaw because you have to have your eyes on her the entire time or you won't have clue what to do, and its not the kind of workout where you can learn what will happen next because its like she is winging it on the spot and you just have to follow. Often Tracy will change moves (like while we are stretching with our hands on the floor and can't see the TV)then she is off doing something else without calling it out. Forgivable if this kind of thing didn't happen frequently.

Then the odd time when she does cue ""5 more of these"" leg lifts and you are counting (because it feels like 5000 reps) and she goes on for like 10 more! Maybe one of the production crew could have gotten a counter for her to remember what count she is on.

She adds these little dancy-type flare moves in between, which of course to a dancer is just a natural part of their movement, but as an instructional exercise video its very difficult to follow or emulate, and sometimes I wonder how essential it is to follow every nuance of her moves because if it was wouldn't she make it easier to follow?

Overall: I think with the ""backing"" she got to make this video and what she is charging for it, she could have made a better DVD- even in post production to add a voice over to help cue the moves or SOMETHING! If you can overlook the flaws- it sure is a hard core total body workout.",1235606400,2,2111,4.215346534653466
3563075,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have an extensive collection of work out DVD's and most just don't deliver -- they are based on whatever the latest fad is, packaged for mass appeal. As someone who is average height and already athletic, many work outs are designed to build muscle, just the opposite of what I want -- sleek, toned lines and a tighter overall form. But this workout delivers. I usually rotate workouts daily, but decided to give this one a true test -- Tracy Anderson encourages using this workout 4 to 6 times a week to see the changes she promises, so that's what I did. In a month, my legs were tighter, and my arms looked fantastic. Serious arm work is a forgotten art in most of the current workouts, except for those that drill you like a weight lifter and you end up with bulky shoulders, less neck and still have flabby underarms, which is why I just don't do them anymore and my arms did suffer. The seemingly endless repetitions of this program will give great definition without bulk -- you'll want to wear sleeveless shirts every day. I should also add that this is the only thing I've ever done that helps the tendonitis in my wrist. I have read criticism here of her style -- she seems very shy, doesn't count out repetitions, often looks off camera, and once, during the leg work, changes the pattern. To me, her style helps make this a work out you can do over and over to pick up on what is going on, sequence your own counts, and concentrate on what you are feeling rather than the pratter of a perky instructor. I personally do not like the music, but it has grown on me. Eventually, however, I will probably turn down the sound and play something more to my liking in the back ground. I don't know why someone would doubt the ""10 years in the making"" -- after all, there is nothing truly new in any program, but this comes close, in the variety of angles and ingenoius sequencing. The warm up is nothing new, but at the very least these are interesting twists on old favorites.  There are standing legs and mat legs. There is a standing ab routine that is reminiscent of the only belly dancing class I've ever taken, and I really am not sure if it is doing anything for me, since I have flat abs already, but it is fun, and it is the only break your going to get in what is a very demanding workout. These are long sets that build on each previous move, then wham! take you in a different direction. The first time you do it, don't get discouraged. It doesn't get easier, but it begins to make sense. I wanted a workout that would help me shape up after the Christams season, keep me interested in doing it, and tone but not build. I am really thankful I found this, even though I hesitated to pay so much for a DVD sine I ususally do them  a few times and retire them forever. Many workouts I ""fall in love with"" the first few times I do them, then either get bored or just don't get any results. I have never done a Kathy Smith workout more than a month or two, which can give you an idea about me and how to rate this review. This work out is a keeper.

My only negative is there are very few teaching points or prompts between moves and so you do have to constantly watch the screen to know when Tracy has moved on to the next exercise.

I was so excited to finally get a chance to try this program that has been raved about. I can only imagine how much Tracy Anderson is making from her clientele as well as her outrageously overpriced videos. Her method is said to be developed from scientific research that spanned a 10 year period. HUH??? I'd love to see this research!  If you've taken ballet, pilates ,yoga, or any dance in general you will be familiar with almost all the moves. The video is poorly done she doesn't seem to take into account that people from all exercise backgrounds will be attempting these exercises. There is hardly any instruction and the music is painful. It's by far the most expensive exercise video I've purchased and easily the one that is lacking the most. She rarely explains what benefits certain exercises are helping you achieve which is in my eyes the point of the video.

3563082,5,B001F2HZHI,"This DVD really is life changing (at the risk of sounding overly cliched!). I'm almost 30 and recently began to see major changes in my body that I did not like, particularly in my thighs. I've been a gym member for years, but I was never motivated to really take my fitness too seriously...I never really liked working out...until this DVD.

The results are fantastic and quick. After only about 2.5 weeks of doing the  Mat DVD for about 6 days per week, with a little bit of cardio (barely any) and not having really changed my way of eating (although I am a vegetarian), I lost inches off my abs, waist and hips. I have been doing the routines for almost 2 months now and the results are fantastic - I've moved up to her cardio DVD and am attending her studio in LA. Up to this point, my upper body is toned and my arms are also tighter - it looks like I trimmed 5 to 7 pounds off my frame, when I have not really seen much weight loss.

This method is so interesting that it makes you feel almost addicted to the moves and you end up looking forward to doing them each day. When you skip a day, you feel awful! Which is great motivation. I can't stress enough that the way this DVD makes you feel is relaxed, stretched out, tight and very much worked out.

My mother started using the DVD (she's 50) and has seen changes in her body as well, in just week's time. She's loving it as well. The moves were definitely tougher for her, especially the abs, but she's getting better the more she performs them.

My arms are small and defined and my legs are long and lean. I forgot my body could look like this! I've been doing the workout since last November and don't bother with any other videos.

After only 4 weeks of doing it 4 times a week, my body is amazing. Yes, I can say that!! My tummy is flat and my legs are shapely and lean. My diet is far from perfect, so I know it is Tracy's magic moves.
She doesn't ""talk you through"" a lot of the moves, so it is best to watch the whole routine first before trying it. But I actually look forward to when my son naps so I can run to the basement and workout.
I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants a truly different approach to toning their bodies--I mean if it is good enough for Gwenyth and Madonna--shouldn't we all have a copy?",1235001600,12,848,4.053571428571429
3563095,5,B001F2HZHI,"This dvd has great music, great sequencing of exerices, and really makes me feel stretched out and stronger after I'm done.  I spent a period of time doing just cardio and Tracy Anderson (mostly her Mat Workout but occasionally her Post Pregnancy Workout) and I noticed that my butt got firmer and A LOT higher than where it used to be. My outter thighs slimmed down, my abs got definition but a differnt sort of definition than what I've experienced with more traditional ab work.  My arms got really small (maybe a little too small for me), but the did look quite toned and defined. The only weakness I see in the workout is that it kind of ingores the quads, while I recognize that a lot of people think they're quads are too big and would therefore not want to work them, I think Tracy could develop exercisizes for the quads and calves that would be similar to way she does for the arm.
This is really an enjoyable workout.  She basically is inviting you to workout with.  There is no class, no constant cueing of the moves, so you're really just doing it will her.  After I finish this workout, I always freel geat!
Things to consider:
IF you like traditional approaches to fintess, heavy weight for strength wrok,this DVD will not like fit you well.
If you like a lot of cueing, this DVD doesn't really give you much of that.  Of course, I personally find that less cueing is better, and so it depends on you personal preferences.",1234915200,3,1437,4.465648854961832
3563096,1,B001F2HZHI,"I've just deleted my old review where I left 5 stars and commentry that it was good if you've got 'sore bits'. I'm really sorry if any of you relied on this as I've found out that it's actually hurting me more than it helps and I didn't realise at first. My physio made me stop doing it 3 weeks ago and my hips and lower back have at last stopped hurting. Basically, the leg and hip movements were stressing out my smaller muscles too much and they were spasming as a result.

If any of you feel worse if you miss doing the workout for a day, the reason is that doing the DVD seems to give temporary relief from the cramping that the exercises actually cause.  Apparently this kind of thing is common in 'hyper mobile' people (if for example you can bend your thumb close towards your wrist, you might have extra elastin in your joints and this means you need to be careful about doing these kind of exercises).

I still love the look and feel of the video and will resume doing the arms part as it's absolutely amazing and it didn't seem to cause problems with my shoulders.  The reason I've marked this down is to flag to people that there could be big problems ahead for you if you do this workout lots and you're hypermobile. I have been in a lot of pain as a result of these exercises and they gave me sciatica!!

I'm really sad about not being able to do the whole workout anymore to be honest as like I say I love her style. Tracy please take what happened to me on board and bring out another DVD with plain old boring lunges and squats, I'll be the first to buy it.",1234915200,93,1574,4.1644736842105265

3563098,4,B001F2HZHI,"I am pretty fit and fairly strong and this DVD is tough.  Nobody should expect to be able to do this straight off, you are definatley going to have to work at it and be patient.  She works to the principle that she exhausts the large muscle groups first and in doing so the smaller accessory muscles kick in which is what trims the body down to a 'teeny tiny structure'.  She hits your muscles from lots of different angles or 'rotations' and you don't stop between each excercise, hense exhausting the larger muscles first.

My only critisicm is that she doesn't explain what the moves do as you are going along and she does change the rotation without telling you.  You have to persist and learn the rotations, so if you have no patience this is not for you.  I am also a Davina Mccall DVD fan so am used to lots of fun banter and encouragment.  Tracy works out on her own and is very quiet in comparison.

Other than this, the DVD is definately worth it and I am now mixing Tracy and Davina on alternate days.

This kind of exercise (waving weights around endlessly) with her lack of attention to form will eventually lead to arthritis or injury.  She may not believe this, but just check on her in 10 years.

I am a ballet and pilates instructor with the ""teeny"" arms and the lean abs, etc. that she was talking about, so I think my comments are valid and coming from a place of experience.

I give it two stars ONLY because the idea of extending out and using the lines of energy is exactly where it's at--too bad everything else is incredibly second-rate.  Even for a super-experienced exerciser this DVD is ridiculous to try to follow.  And where are the modifications?  Where are the alignment tips?

3563108,3,B001F2HZHI,"I just tried this workout for the first time after hearing rave review's about Tracy's methods. First of all, I should say that I loved the exercises. I have a pilates/yoga/dance background, so they were variations on a familiar theme. I think it's a very effective workout and I'll do it again.

Having said that, I really can't recommend this DVD. Tracy seems more interested in showing you what she can do rather than teaching you to do it yourself. The program was not well-designed. Here are some of the problems:

* Almost no verbal cues. Seriously. You have to watch her every second because she randomly alters her movements in the middle of a segment WITHOUT SAYING A WORD! I found this particularly annoying in the ab section where it's difficult to look at the screen the whole time. I'd glance over to find her doing something completely different.

* Movements are not always performed to the beat of the music. Sometimes, she ignores the music completely.

* No defined choreography. She doesn't do an exercise for a defined number of beats, doesn't do the same number of reps on each side, etc. Sometimes, she seems to be randomly doing whatever she feels like and we're supposed to just try and follow along. This seemed incredibly lazy to me. I mean, if you're going to put out a DVD and charge $20+ for it, at least take the time to plan the choreography so that your viewers can follow along.

* No mirroring of position. For example, she said ""start with your right foot behind you"" and then puts her actual right foot behind her. Most exercise teachers understand that the viewer will be mirroring you, so if you say ""start on the right"" the teacher actually starts on the left so she'll match the viewer.

Some reviewers have commented about Tracy trying to ""dance sexy"" while doing the moves. It's odd for a teacher to do that and I found it a bit cheesy, but it didn't put me off the workout.

Overall, I'd say that if Tracy took the time to plan out the exercises and coordinated the music, this DVD would be a MUCH better investment.",1234396800,13,2059,4.548648648648649

If you're watching your own form, she might have switched through two different movements - without saying anything - and you miss it. The other thing that's a bummer is that you can't skip to different parts of the workout. She says in the video that if you want to feel more challenged - repeat the sequence - but you can't skip forward or backward - you have to start the mat routine all the way at the beginning. Kind of a waste.",1234396800,,529,4.408163265306122
3563110,3,B001F2HZHI,"While Tracy has some great exercises, she is lacking in the way she teaches them.  I've done tons of other videos and DVD's presented by quaified trainers and their cueing is usually excellent. She seldom tells the viewer what position their body should be in which might be difficult for a lot of people to follow especially if they are new to exercising.  Her method is intense which I find to be a good thing, but she assumes, for example, that everyone knows what an ""attitude"" position is. I think she is on to something different in her exercise approach, I just wish she knew how to put that across instructionally on the DVD.",1234396800,9,633,4.543859649122807
3563111,3,B001F2HZHI,"Overall, I liked this workout and found that even though it is very low impact, the sequences were challenging and my body was quite sore the next day (especially in the upper arms)

However, I feel I have to voice my critiques, which pretty much echo those recurring criticisms about instruction and technique. Tracy needs her own lesson in aerobics instruction. Throughout the video she seems to be in her own little world, forgets to give a heads up when she changes a move (like when you're facing upside down in the warm ups and she never indicates that she is up and onto the next move. It's a little hard to follow when you're not facing the TV). She fails to give proper visual context as to how the leg movements are done and exactly how the body is aligned--instead you're on your own to figure it out by pausing the video (should my hip be turned up or down?) and the standing ""ab work"" is a joke, really. Also, the counts she does on all the moves are different and sometimes not the same number on each side.

The truth is that it's a fundamentally good workout, but I think this freshman effort at a Workout DVD falls short of being great because the instruction is so bad. I'd suggest redoing the DVD with careful consideration to technique and vocal instruction. And lose the standing ab sequence. It's useless and one just sort ends up wagging their torso back and forth.",1234137600,2,1388,4.482213438735178

She does alot of reps too, so someone who is just starting an exercise program will find that a bit of a challenge, as well.  I think if you stick to it though, as Gwyneth Paltrow attests to, you will definitely see results.

Tracy advises doing it 4-6 times a week, well this is quite allot and I only manage 4 times a week but I can see and feel the difference. When I didn't do it for 2 weeks I also noticed that its sooo much harder when you try to get back into it.

It's broken up into different segments that focus on the legs and bum, arms and abs and all together lasts for an hour. However don't feel like you have to do them all at once, some days I only do the arms and it's still effective. One thing though, although it's called the mat workout you only actually use the mat during 2 segments.

The commentary is minimal which is quite good when you need to do it 4-6 times a week, but sometimes it's too minimal. For example when you are swapping legs or sides and she doesn't mention it - if you have your eyes closed or look away, you can end up doing too much on one side, and then of course you need to compensate when you switch sides, so you do more than what was really required!

3563114,4,B001F2HZHI,"I have been experimenting with different types of exercise for 22 years. I gain muscle easily which can make me look bulky, and is multiplied by the fact that I am short. So I am always looking for toning exercises that do not bulk.

Pluses: First I had tried some of Tracy's exercises that I found in a magazine. I liked them enough to try her dvd. The exercises were similar to the exercises in her dvd, but high reps of 50 to 100.  The types of exercises in this dvd use multiple muscles, high reps, and low to no weight, are perfect for toning without bulk. I have several pilates type dvds that are good too in that they do not bulk. But this dvd seems to work a wider range of muscles than the other dvds. On a superficial side, I like her studio and the choice of music as well.

Minuses: I would say that if you need instruction, and/or are not in tune with your body enough to feel if your body is in a safe or beneficial position, then this is probably not the dvd for you.",1233964800,,983,4.109375

My arms look amazing and feel very graceful--I am becoming more graceful with each time.  I am so happy to have found a match for my wants--I want a very tiny feminine body .  THe one I had when I was 16--now I am very close to acheiving that goal thanks to the unique techniques Tracey introduces here--Just remember to breath when you feel like you are not able to do another rep its because you aren't breathing-The arms routine is ridiculously difficult and I have been able to do a lttile more each time .  I like the challenge--I just swing my arms out to stretch when I can't bear the pain during the arms--and each time I find I can do a little more--Don't get discouraged about the arms--view it as a challenge.

i got it because i read about her, and heard about gweneth and madonna and it looked ""different"" like everyone else did. as a supplement to your serious workout routine, or for women who are already tiny but just want a little more tightness or definition i could see this working. but i feel sorry for anyone who has serious body work to do and buys this thinking her ""method"" alone is going to do the trick. keep in mind--she has her celebrity clients using a special resistance band technique non-stop (she did not put gweneth paltrow's workout on here okay) so your at home results could vary...good luck.",1233360000,2,1176,4.444444444444445

3563124,4,B001F2HZHI,"I purchased this video after having my 2nd child so I can get back into shape and workout my abs.  Prior to my pregnancies I worked out 5-6 days a week at the gym lifting weights and doing cardio and I was in very good shape.  It's been over 3 years since I last worked out so getting back into it was hard but worth it.  I've been using this video now for the past 3 weeks and I must say it's a challenging workout but I think it's great.

Tracy starts out with a brief warm up, the abs then legs, and then the arms and a brief cool down.  The workout is about 45 mins long and I find it perfect if you're at home with 2 kids. I squeeze this workout in when both my kids are napping.  The excercises are a bit challenging at first but as you do it more it gets a bit easier.  She gives you alternative movements if you can't do the difficult ones (most people won't be able to do those right off the bat).  I find my self sweating after the workout and I feel pretty good too.  The video is tastefully done and she plays classical music in the background.  There's a short interview with Gwenyth Paltrow and Tracy at the end.

I find it motivating and look forward to my workout.  It's hard to get out to the gym and workout with 2 kids so I find this perfect to fit into my lifestyle at the moment.  I ordered both the mat DVD and the post pregnancy one and will probably order the Dance cardio too.  Since I don't have any cardio equipment at home, I need something so i can do cardio with.  I eat well and workout to this video and a workout program my husband made for me (he's a personal trainer) and have lost some weight.  I don't know how much cause I didn't weigh myself prior but I can fit into my pre-2nd baby jeans again and wear my wedding band.  I'm looking forward to getting back into the jeans I wore before I even had kids...still a long way to go.

The price for the DVD is okay to me, but the cost of shipping was hard to swallow, and with the exchange rate, I ended up paying a bit over $100 for the 2 DVDs which I think is a bit steep.  I also wish that Tracy could have given instructions as to how we can increase the intensity (either how many more reps, etc) after one gets use to the workout.  That's my only complaint.",1233100800,8,2247,4.0067415730337075
3563125,2,B001F2HZHI,"This workout is interesting but she doesn't verbalize enough. She changes what she is doing (often quickly) without cues and it's often not clear what she is doing specifically enough to follow. It is kinda of odd at times like she is doing the workout for herself rather than to teach. For me a lot of what she is doing is totally new and unfamiliar (I think that is part of her purpose - its her unique workout approach) so I don't have any previous instruction to fall back on as one might with more typical workout routines.

I'm used to yoga instruction where you can focus on your own movement and follow basic verbal cues from the instructor and not have to decipher what is going on.",1233100800,8,691,4.3984375

3563127,5,B001F2HZHI,"I love Tracy's method!  Tracy focuses on accessory muscles (smaller muscles) to avoid bulk and to pull in skin and larger muscle groups for a tighter, dancer like, long lean toned look.  She is trainer to Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna and I think that says it right there.  If you like Gwyneth's slim toned look, this tape is for you.

Her style is a little different and may not appeal to everyone.  It has a ballet/pilates - like feel to it but is still different than the two.  She uses some dance terminology but not enough to confuse those who wouldn't be familiar with it.  The music is really cool and relaxing yet energizing and she doesn't talk too much and not the least bit annoying (like other fitness instructors).  She gives direction but doesn't over do it so if you're someone that likes someone to constantly talk to you about what you're doing, you might not like her style.

When I first saw her exercises/moves, I wondered if they would do anything or would they be that hard.  Let me tell you, her moves are challenging and they burn in a different way.  I was definitely using muscles that I don't normally when I work out.  I'm very excited to see the results and I would highly recommend this workout to try something new for strength and toning.  Definitely worth the price.

PS. You need 3 lbs. weights (trust me you wouldn't want any heavier for her moves) and any regular dining room chair.",1232755200,9,1416,4.5019607843137255

I think if you enjoy the gym doing the body pump and more aerobics type of classes then you will probably not enjoy this video much, as it is a different exercise style.
There have been complaints about the lack of ques or explanation, but I love that she talks very little.  That is one of the reasons why you can do this video day after day.

I was so excited that I put it in asap. I have found that most workouts are way too hard on my joints and leave me feeling as if I have been ran over by a truck, not this one!

I kept waiting for the DVD to get hard or to come to a point where due to my joint damage, I would be unable to continue, never happened!
I am so thrilled with Tracy's method and look forward to sharing my results with everyone. Although she does switch moves quickly, I found her easy to follow.

Overall, I'm glad I got it.  I can use it in conjunction with my fitness regimen.

I'd read the reviews before I bought, so there were no surprises - I could enjoy it for what it's worth:  a good change of pace, very 'dancer-ly'.  It reminds me of portions of the dance classes I took in high school / college, so maybe that helped me.  The concept of ""accessory muscle"" training makes a lot of sense, and I can incorporate that into the rest of my fitness.

After doing the workout three times in nine days, I'd actually noticed some toning.  It's a much more fluid form of movement and exercise (than, say, step aerobics or kickboxing), and therefore helps my poise and core.  As a disclaimer, I hadn't done much training in a couple months, so probably MANY kinds of resistance training would show results.

I mostly appreciate all of the arm sections (REALLY works my shoulders).  Unique, fun moves.  I also find great value in the unique horizontal ab moves.

 As many have said, there is VERY minimal instruction, and that can be frustrating and laughable.  Much of the time, you can figure it out - but it will require you to really look closely and really connect with your body.  If you want a lot of guidance, just pass on this video.

For me, lack of instruction is especially a problem on the leg work, because there seem to be more variables in form -  (feet pointed?  knee in or out? how to align leg? back twisted?).  You really have to go through trial and error to see what details work best.

With Ms. Anderson's lack of skill as a group instructor (perhaps she's fabulous when you are gwyneth and doing one-on-one training ;P ), there should have at LEAST been more close-ups, video angles, or even text guidance.  For something that's being marketed as ""high end"" you'd think they could have made more of an effort.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, DVD chapters would have been great when you want to mix it up.

Also... girl shoulda worn her hair pulled back!  Sometimes it's hard to consider her form when it looks like she's shrugging her shoulders throughout with all that hair.

I always work out with a Polar heart rate monitor.  It was nice to find that I burn around 300 calories from doing this hour long workout.  (I'm 31 years old, 5'4"", 120 pounds, in good shape).  So in addition to toning, you'll get a little cardio and calorie burn.

The 3 pound weights used in this video's sequences are challenging.  However, it irks me that Tracy Anderson claims women should NEVER lift more than 3 pounds. I think that ""bulking"" is a myth depending on how well you balance your training. Ms. Anderson should better define what she means by bulking - it's irresponsible to lead women to believe they'll look like Arnold if they lift light dumbbells (5-12 lbs) !",1231027200,502,2990,4.549718574108818
3563142,4,B001F2HZHI,I did this work out for the first time yesterday and I am definetly sore today.  There were a few exercises that will take some time to nail and she really doesn't give you ANY guidance on form so if you are inexperienced or just starting to workout this isn't for you.  If you have experience with pilates or yoga you should be fine.  I feel like if I do this 4 or 5 times a week with some added cardio I will get results.  :),1230940800,,427,3.9302325581395348
3563143,5,B001F2HZHI,"I am in my 30s and have been a lifelong on and off exerciser(gym, treadmill, mostly The Firm videos)...  About a year ago, I had an a-ha moment and realized that I was having a hard time ""sticking"" with working out, because with my Firm videos I wasn't really seeing good results and they were boring me to death!

That's when I switched over to yoga/pilates/barre workouts which I have truly enjoyed and have provided me with results...however, I had plateau'ed and was (coincidentally) thinking of how I could supplement with dance cardio when I saw Gwyneth Paltrow and TA on Oprah.  After some research I ordered the TA Dance Aerobics (older dvd) through her studio...and enjoyed it so much that I decided to go for it with the Mat WO as well, even though I had promised myself to not spend any more $$ on tapes for a little while.

This has to be my #1 favorite DVD I own now.  I have been doing it about three times a week and also doing the dance aerobics dvd.  I have lost some inches over the past month even though I took a lot of days off and haven't had the best diet due to the holidays.

Here are some things I wanted to point out to anyone considering purchasing the Mat DVD:
* This is an intermediate-advanced workout.  Newbies should expect to take it easy and definitely don't plan to be able to do this 4-6xs a week at first!  You could hurt yourself (I am thinking mainly with the arm/shoulder portion) due to overtraining.

* The arm workout is a ~~standout~~ feature of the TA method.  I have very rounded shoulders, I believe due to poor posture and bad genes.  It took me almost one month before I was able to get through the unweighted arm session (I think this is a sign of how weak the smaller muscle groups were in my upper body).  I see more change in my arms/shoulders/chest/back than I have ever seen doing any other kind of workout.  Thank you, Tracy!

* Weighted arm section, most likely you will need 1-2 lbs to start regardless of your strength.  I could use 10lbs with Firm tapes but could barely get through using 1lb weights at first.

* The leg exercises really require a lot of concentration (as Tracy says herself during the workout).  Due to the large range of motion, you can easily just swing your legs around(momentum) and not really use the muscles properly.  I try to imagine I am pulling a weight with my toes and envision my leg is following an imaginary line to help keep control and the leg portion has become much more difficult the more I control it.

* I must say...I do not endorse doing 2hrs ~or the two tapes~ a day unless you are an more experienced exerciser and know your body well and know about overtraining.  With that said, this tape will provide you with great results doing it 3-4 times a week along with cardio and I personally find Tracy (her philosophy and body type) to be inspiring fitness-wise.

**Edited to add:
(I thought it would be helpful to add this one last thing)

WHY IS THIS WORKOUT DIFFERENT:
Tracy Anderson's Mat Workout really does take different components from other exercise genres and combines them to make a very unique workout.

For instance, she uses the Fluidity principle of trying to engage as many muscles as possible in movements...  An example of this would be traditional floor hip-thigh isolation work from Firm workouts, she does similar moves but while standing behind a chair, so you are working the moving leg but also the standing leg and additionally you are engaging the muscles in the arms while holding the chair and the core and back.

She also incorporates Pilates elements into her exercises (stretch and strengthen types of movements, larger ranges of motion).

Many of her standing leg ""rotations"" seem to me to be a variation of the Callanetics/Bar Method's Pretzel (which targets the outer hip/glute area).

Lastly, because it is such high repetitions, lots of motion, I feel I am keeping my heartrate up during much of the workout.

I have added 10-30 minutes of Dance Aerobics before doing the Mat WO to warm up and my body feels as if it every single muscle has been exhausted from head to toe but leaves me also feeling invigorated with a ""workout high"".  Happy Exercising!",1230768000,"1,339",4192,4.550666666666666

3563205,1,B001F2HZHI,"I was sold on Gwyneth's testimonial and even saw a video of her working out with Tracy. The exercise video - huge huge disappointment. I'm going to echo some of the other comments on these reviews but it needs to be stated. Tracy doesn't conduct this video like an exercise video, it seems to be more like she's performing or dancing around on stage. Her moves are hard to follow and she tries to maintain this sex kittenish thing that I both find annoying and embarrassing. Her abs part doesn't seem to work the abs at all and she throws in this hip wiggle thing at the end that seems to be a way to show off her hip bones (I'm really not understanding how that move has anything to do with abs). And her ""teeny tiny arms"" and ""muscular structure"" bit - I don't think she knows what she's talking about. I've weight-trained since I was a teenager and have yet to bulk up from living heavy weights. I also thought it was too much for her to expect us to perform the non-weighted arm exercises as well as the 3-lb weighted ones. And I'm not sure about you all: but the only part of my arms that was sore the next day were my shoulders. So much so that I thought I had pulled something. Her movements are not easy to understand - she pulls her leg behind her and twists and contorts in a way that's not easy to follow. I am continuing to do the work out, because I paid $30 for the video. I'll see if it transforms my body into the ""teeny tiny"" vessel she talks about so glowingly.",1229040000,25,1479,4.192982456140351

I don't usually like home workout DVD's but I thought i'd give this one a shot. Well, I have to say I am completely disappointed-and it's not the workout, it's HER. She is a TERRIBLE instructor. She hardly talks or explains what to do and she doesn't count down to let you know when you should change. There is a section on the DVD for standing abs where she rocks back and forth and every which way. Well whomever shot this DVD needs to go back to workout video school because a lot of the time it is shot over her head so you can't see which way she is rocking and she doesn't bother to tell you where to go. She simply says, 'this takes time to figure out but you'll get it.' I mean, they could have at least included paper instructions for some of the exercises. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out a workout video, but for $29.99, I'd expect a little bit more. I mean-who cares if she trains Madonna and Gwyneth.

I had been stuck at an eight for so long, but this method has worked for me, reducing inches from places I never dreamed possible at 44 years of age.

My body slowly fell out of shape over the past 10 years even though I went to the gym all the time. I also had a baby 9 months ago.  After three weeks of doing this video, my body was already starting to feel like it did when I was dancing.  The music is cool, not annoying.  She gives minimal direction which can be good if you are capable of copying what she does by watching and if you are aware of what your own body is doing. This was easy for me (and most people probably), but I can imagine that it could be tricky for some.  I like the fact that she doesn't yell ""you can do it!"", all the time with a fake smile.  That kind of stuff grates on my nerves by the 20th time.  You can tell she is there to work, just like you.  you do need to add some cardio to this work-out though.

I can't say it is the worst workout dvd I've done yet there were some definite negatives. Her cuing is essentially nonexistent. She looks painfully bored throughout the dvd. Also, it is clear she has no background in being a certified personal trainer given some of the moves with the weights were straining my neck so not exactly safe. I've made my own variations. After doing workouts with excellent cuing by people who clearly have the education and experience to demonstrate they know what they are talking about (Gunnar Peterson, Cathe, Joni Love for example), this dvd is a supplement, not my end all be all dvd to workout with.",1228694400,3,724,4.62015503875969

Tracy moves from one thing to the next so quickly and doesn't even tell you what she's doing - This was hugely frustrating and her lack of instruction was evident throughout the entire hour of the DVD.  There is a segment on abs and moving around your rib cage that is just ridiculous (I am a salsa dancer and have some experience with rib cage work)...but this was hilarious.  Tracy is moving all over the place at different angles with her rib cage and she doesn't say a word to the viewer about which way she is going, preparing for what's next, etc.  She just doesn't have a strong instruction component.  I felt her personality was really introverted.  She didn't really inspire or pump me up at all!  I had this DVD week for a couple weeks, did the routine three times and just sold it on eBay last week.  I think it's boring, but who knows - maybe it works if you stick with it.  It just isn't the workout for me!!",1228608000,53,962,4.2707182320441985
3563213,4,B001F2HZHI,"I love at home work out DVDs.  I'm not one for gyms as I like to be able to work out whenever I have the time to squeeze it in - whether it be while something is cooking in the oven, late at night, whatever.  I thought I'd give this one a try since I saw that it was highly reccommended (and the Madonna/Gwyneth Paltrow endorsement didn't hurt either).

I really like this routine a lot. Why?
Great music - most workout DVDs are filled with the cheesiest music that I just have to tolerate.  This music is really good - so good that I wished there was a listing of what was used included in the DVD so that I could seek out the artists and download the tunes! That has NEVER happened to me before on a workout DVD.
Friendly and likeable instructor - there are some fitness gurus that I just can't stand because watching them and hearing them is unbearable.  Tracy Anderson is calm, soothing, and sweet.
Doesn't need a lot of space - I wish I would have had this when I lived in an apartment. Not only does it not take a lot of space, but since you aren't jumping around or anything you wouldn't disturb downstair neighbors.
Effective routine - the routine really challenges my muscles to the point of fatigue.  She doesn't move on too soon to the next thing.  I really feel my muscles work.  And the best part is that the moves themselves are not hard to master.  The moves are actually all pretty basic - it is just the exhaustion of the muscles that really makes it work.
No real extra ""materials"" needed - Do you have a chair?  Do you have light weights or at least something you can sub as light weights (water bottles)?  Then you're set to go.  She has a mat, but the mat really isn't necessary.
Length - To me this DVD is the perfect length. It isn't too long to where I get bored and feel I'm using excess time I don't have.  Nor is it too short where I feel like I'm not doing enough.  Great balance of time.

My only complaint I really have with this DVD is that I wish Tracy would talk just a bit more - specifically when she changes moves on the floor ab part.  Because she doesn't audibly say she's starting something new with each move or side, I have to physically try to watch the TV while doing these.  I'm assuming that's not the most efficient/best way to do it since usually I like to focus on the ceiling or something to keep my form in check.  If I'm turning to the side to see what she's doing, then I'm not really focusing on what I am doing.",1228262400,4,2465,4.175475687103594

The exercises are very different from all the other exercise videos in my collection and I think that makes it refreshing.",1228262400,2,293,3.9
3563225,5,B001F2HZHI,"I chose this dvd for its reputation of delivering a dancer's physique.

 Tracy's method reminds me of callanetics, except that its choreographed to good music, and it has an excellent arm workout. Even with the newer callanetics, I felt I still needed more armwork.
 Tracy has arms to die for. While you are following along, its hard to not notice what gorgeous arms she has. People have noted that she doesn't say much, which I personally am grateful for. Watching gorgeous arms is far more motivating. I keeps me from taking breaks...just watch the gorgeous arms, keep going!

She explains at the beginning of the dvd that she is going to work out your larger muscle groups first and then all the smaller supporting muscles to obtain that dancer's look. For example, there are rib isolations, like belly dancer drills. She has you rotate working them from different angles, so its not just the top or the sides working out, but all around, underneath. Places you didn't realize you had muscles, like the ribs! I had sore rib muscles!

 I have bad knees-- bone to bone pain plus a ""trick knee"" which means the knee cap itself will slip without warning and make me fall. My physical therapist wanted me to do lunges and squats, to strengthen the small muscles around the knees to support them, so they don't scrape and don't slip. But I can't do them because my bones are scraping! Dilemna! (Glucosamine Chrondrointan helps tremendously, but I still need muscle.)

 When I saw Tracy doing a few ballet moves, with bent knees, I thought I was going to have to skip that part, but It turns out its gentle yet deep and effective, again, like callanetics. I can do them.

Each day there is less pain and ""creaking"" noise in regards to my knees. I used to use my arms to get out of my daughter's sports car. Now, after two weeks, I get out like everyone else. A small miracle!

 The workout is mindful, graceful, artistic, and uplifting-- Even a little sexy!  My glimpses of myself in the mirror working out to check form and posture surprise me--instead of having an internal dialogue at how disgusting I look, I look like a dancer! ;)",1228176000,5,2131,4.608465608465608

3563228,4,B001F2HZHI,"I've been working out with Tracy's DVD's for a few months now and I can tell you that I like what I'm seeing! First of all, I am a 33 year old man who up until recently LOVED to jog regularly. Then I discovered Tracy's Dance Aerobics DVD. Then, she came out with this line of workouts and I was thrilled. I definately see a difference. As everyone knows, Tracy trains Madonna and Gwyneth. So I kinda feel like I'm getting a bargain of what those two pay. I bet Madonna would love to only pay $30 to workout with Tracy. I have to admit, I was not going to write a review for this product because I already wrote one for her dance cardio dvd and I felt that was enough. But after reading a few negative reviews about Tracy, I wanted to come to her defense. First of all, I agree- Tracy cannot cue if her life depended on it!! But I noticed something odd today. I live in Manhattan, with paper-thin walls and a new neighbor was moving in next door. I found myself NOT reaching for the remote to lower the volume because since Tracy doesnt cue, I didn't have to worry about my neighbors being up in my business. I let the music play. They probably thought I had the radio on. The other thing is that I think Tracy intended for us to memorize these workout (which we will inevitably do anyway) thats why theres very little cueing. Come on, admit it, doesnt it get on your nerves hearing karen voight, kathy smith, denise austin, tamilee webb- day after day saying ""and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4!"" ""lift the leg higher!"" "" kick! and jump! and turn! and clap!"" I don't care how sweet they sound, it gets annoying day after day. Especially if theres a mistake in the video. With Tracy, I don't have that problem. As for Tracys weight training beliefs- she has said from day 1 that she wants to work the small muscles to death so that they pull in the big muscles. Giving us a thinner look. Just give it a try. Obviously it works for Madonna, Gwyneth and me :)

While there are some great innovative exercises that will tire your arms and legs quickly, I fault the DVD in that the instructor does not elaborate much (or talk very much at all for the entire HOUR the DVD runs!) on the exercises.  She really only offers a few tips here and there for a few exercises she does, and fails to deliver on giving tips to improve form, efficiency, and otherwise ""coach"" during the workout.

I would suggest to anyone purchasing this DVD to be prepared to be BORED quickly and feel somewhat disappointed for spending $30 in a DVD when you it would be much better spent on either a monthly membership at a gym or two other DVD's where the instructor actually conducts the video in a ""class"" format. I felt more like this DVD was a session of Tracy working out on her own, rather than catering to the viewer.

The bad ones, the instruction is almost non-existent (watch me and do as I do), she pouts and moves a bit too sexy for my taste and she talks about ""reengineering muscular structure"" and ""teeny, tiny arms"" in a way that makes me cringe a little. She wants you to commit to doing her workout 4-6 times a week to get results.
The dvd is chaptered but there are only these sections: mat intro, mat routine, Gwyneth interview and Tracy's interview. During the workout itself, you cannot jump to the arm series but have to FF.  The workout clocks at 57:20 min divided into a gentle warm-up 5:48, a series of leg lifts using a chair for balance 15:12, followed by a series of rib-cage isolations 4:00. Next come two different arm series: one without weights 7:11, and one using light weights (3 lbs or less.) 8:10.

3563335,4,B001F2HZHI,"This is an option for me on days I need a little variety. I weight trained 4 days a week and have used this tape on my cardio days. This really cranks your muscles on especially the legs workout. But other than that, if I was to do this 6 days a week, I would be very bored. I don't mind having muscles definitions larger than the message indicated on this DVD, and using weights no more than 3 lbs is suitable for this type of workout. I've weight trained for the last 25yrs and have never bulked up. As a petite person and to be teeny tiny isn't what I prefer. I've worked hard to have a certain look  and I like my muscles definitions. I would never give up my training regimen, but this Mat Workout adds to my cardio routine. Would recommend if you have 60+ minutes a day. Most days I can only disciplined to 45minutes of hard training and have to go make money.",1225497600,2,866,4.124260355029586
3563336,5,B001F2HZHI,"Tracy's approach to working out has done for me (previously a size 6.) Her DVD has done what no one else could do, make me a 4 with out dieting! Please look beyond preferences on DVD workoout instruction or her personality (all of which I actually like - alot!) and go for what truely works, and that is her method!! I just bought the post pregnancy even though I have never had any kids, because I read it is even harder, and I figure because I am hooked on her routein, my body will soon get more used to it, and I need to keep mixing it up. Whatever else she releases, I will buy. A++++ I am 28 and was starting to feel like I could not fight time, and would no longer look like I did at 21, and was really sad about that, and almost ready to give up, and only look good in my ""skinny"" jeans. My arms are tiny like she promises, my legs have never been this skinny, my stomach is hard and feels great, my face glows and I don't look so tired in the morning, and I really feel more graceful. They say is if you want to look like a body builder, lift weights, if you want to look like a dancer, dance! They are right! :) Tracy has given me back that confidence, and that youthful extra something something, and for that, I am forever thankful, as this will transfer over to all other areas of my life.

In exercise I mean. A great compliment to ballet or yoga. I have gotten so stiff in my lower back from my day job so I have absolutely no interest in lunges with heavy weights and high impact bla bla bla to keep my weight down.

3563403,2,B001F2HZHI,"I am a professional trainer and was very much looking forward to learning something new from such a reputable, results-oriented trainer.  However, if I did not have the background I have, I would not be able to reap the benefits of this DVD.  I do, have the training, so I enjoyed the routine.  I am just very concerned for people who are just trying so hard to re-shape their bodies, and are actually putting themselves at risk for injury doing this DVD.

1. Tracy gives very little audible instruction - practically no modification options, and she rarely cues the student during transitions from one movement to another.

2. She doesn't instruct at all during the ab section, and just expects students to pick up what she is doing from watching her.

3. She doesn't define what she means when she says ""pain"".  There is acceptable levels of discomfort, and then there is PAIN!  Sometimes pain means STOP!

If you have experience, and you can take care of yourself, you might find this series to be wonderful - you will feel it for sure.  But if you don't have experience, and you choose to do this work out, WATCH first, and then try it - respect your body and proceed with caution.

It seems to combine a variety of exercise styles, so the moves are familiar in many ways and none are particularly difficult in and of themselves, yet the high reps combined with the sequencing make for a challenging routine. If you are someone who requires a lot of verbal cues, be forewarned that on this DVD Tracy Anderson does not provide much commentary but rather relies heavily on the viewer picking up on her form visually. I actually like this aspect of the DVD a lot because I find it forces me to focus and keeps boredom at bay.

It looks like a homemade DVD, there is hardly any instruction and what there was poor. Tracy seems to love herself and her dance ability, it is a shame she does not spend more time teaching. I am sure the method would be effective if you were able to see what she was doing. I am glad I didn't order the cardio DVD at the same time as I, am sure I would be hospitalised.

I was sore the next day, so it did work my muscles.  I am not cordinated AT ALL and there are some moves that are rythm or danced based which I found difficult.  She goes right into each exercise without much explantion or example. This workout is not for beginners.  After beinf disappointed in this workout I did some research and decided to order The Bar Method and I really enjoyed this workout.

The arm workout really surprised me, I did not think I would feel the ""burn"" with 3 pound weights but I truly did.  The only thing that I would suggest is more cuing and showing you how to do certain routines/movements the correct way by the instructor, especially during the standing abdomen routine----I felt like, ""what I am suppose to do here"" and it was like watching Tracy doing an audition.

However, Tracy takes for granted that many of the people who may be trying her video are novices and she doesn't call out what she is doing or count reps etc.  It's basically a routine where you watch her and mimic what she is doing.

I have already noticed a difference after 2 weeks of doing it 3-4 times a week--and the only motivation I need is watching Tracy--she is lovely, has a calm demeanor--not bubbly and hyper as some videos can be, and the setting is lovely--I belive it is Gwyneth Paltrow's workout room, as they were on Oprah together.

Tracy is warm and personable; her cuing is subtle but very specific.  She does not talk a lot, but she definitely gives good instructions and pointers where appropriate.  The music is engaging without being overwhelming, and the setting is very serene and lovely.

As to the workout itself, you begin with a gentle warm-up, and then go into a series of leg lifts using a chair for balance.  Then there is a series of rib-cage isolations (these are a bit hard to follow, but even if you just keep doing basic rib cage isolations rather than Tracy's more complicated ones, you'll still get a great workout).  Next come two different arm series: one without weights, and one using light weights (3 lbs or less.)  Then it's on to the floor for leg and butt work, and finally a floor ab-series and a cool down.  All this comes in at just under an hour.

I am a healthy, fit, exercise DVD junky, and I have NEVER done anything quite like this workout.  I've done similar workouts, but never ones as immediately effective as this.  And I have done some of these moves before, as some of them are taken straight from traditional dance classes, but again, never have I done a collection of exercises put together like this, and I loved it.

Since I cannot find the ab section on the video either I do that one from memory.  Below was my originial review.

At fifty-something I enjoy working with this video.  I finally figured out her rhythm especially at the parts where I cannot see the video - i.e. during the warm-up.  After you do the video a couple times you know what Tracy is doing next.  At first, I also was wondering about the correct way to move but found that watching where her arms and legs movements begin and end, the quick camera shots of different angles, her extra movements, I had no problems.  I also enjoy the standing ab work - she states it takes time to get the hang of it and I have found it quite ""moving"" trying to get to that point.",1223510400,3,1058,4.067632850241546

Not in a dripping sweat kinda way, but in a total muscle fatigue sort of way.
You don't need a lot of space...believe me...I don't have any.  You'll need a chair for support...I use a tall barstool!  The weights can be anywhere from 1-3 lbs.  You could easily do it without the weights and still feel the burn!!!  It's great.  I love that it is just Tracy doing the work up close and personal.

Although I work out in a gym with weights, this dvd helps you stretch and strengthen, and elongate your muscles, much like pilates or ballet, to give you a toned, balanced, but not bulky, physique.",1223337600,2,375,4.582089552238806
3563580,5,B001F2HZHI,"I work out all the time and purchased this video for a change of pace. Well I don't know where these comments are coming from where people are saying that they couldn't feel their arms during the arm portion of the video, because I truly fatigued mine! I could not even lift them after a certain point. They are still sore, and I did this dvd in the morning today. If you like videos without cheesy smiley instructors who's voices become innerving after a certain point, then purchase this video. Watch it first before you do the workout and then you will be more comfortable doing it afterwards. This is a good workout, It's different and you really do feel like you are working out different parts of your body.",1223251200,4,713,4.492307692307692
3563581,5,B001F2HZHI,"I bought this dvd after seeing the segment on Oprah. I decided to write this because of the people who wrote bad reviews and didn't even watch the dvd. Let's get the cons out of the way first. She doesnt explain all of the routine that well. But it was so easy to follow along. It's very simple to follow espically if you are fimilar with Callentics.

Pro's
-great music espically for an exercise dvd !
-barely any equipment is needed a chair, and 3 pound weights
-little space is needed
-an intense workout that is completed in under an hour

Seriously Tracy hits every major muscle group without the use of weighs ! Yes even the arms without weights and you can really feel the burn. She shys away from most traditional moves so most of these moves were new to me and really hit my trouble spots. There is a segment when you do use weights but they are light and after doing the arm routine without the weights sometimes 3 pounds can be too much. And I used to lift weights hardcore at the gym. She gets the arms done in less time than the gym. And the standing leg segment is killer.

The dvd starts out with a warm up, then standing legs using a chair, then standing abs which burned it was a lot like dancing, then arms without weights, arms with weights, lower body on the mat then finally abs on the mat.

I now this dvd is a little more pricy than the usual dvd but if you have purchaseed Turbo Jam or something along those lines you know you have to pay more for a excellent exercise dvd. It is worht the money you spent. There are no lunges and squats which get old and boring. The music is mellow but good (I actually liked most of the songs) and the routine is about an hour long. If your not certain after this review that this dvd is the one for you read my other various exercise dvd reviews to see if we like the same type of workouts. But this one is good if you want an intense workout that does not take long and leaves you winded and sweaty.",1223078400,61,1961,4.16622691292876
3563592,4,B001F2HZHI,"I purchased this DVD mainly for its arm exercises, but I'm not sure if I'm working the right muscles because Tracy barely gives any direction.  I don't feel sore in my biceps or triceps, so I know I'm definitely not working those muscles.  Instead, my shoulders (deltoids) are killing me.  Do others find this too?  Are we doing her exercises correctly?

All in all, the DVD is a good workout, but I agree with the other reviewers, more direction would have been appropriate and helpful.",1222992000,,487,4.682352941176471
3563593,5,B001F2HZHI,"I have done it all for 25 years and this is the best thing I have ever done for my body.  I have three kids and my body was in o.k. shape but I could never get it to where I was happy with it no matter what I did. I tried pilates, yoga, spinning, step.  None of them did much for me and they bored me to no end.  Tracy is the best and this video is incredible. I love that I don't have to leave my house. Someone said they needed more instruction from her and that she doesnt talk enough. I disagree completely.  She tells you just what you need to know and its very easy to follow. I can concetrate on the work and not her talking to much.  I cant say enough about how much I LOVE this video. I would love to take her class. I hope she comes out with more videos. I would buy them all. But Really this and the dance video is all you will ever need. Bye bye weight watchers!",1222992000,5,874,3.8066298342541436
3563594,3,B001F2HZHI,"I think the dvd is very expensive and for this should be more professional.  There is very little cueing and I find myself in the warm up bent down and Tracy is up into another move.

After the arms warm up she says if you find it not hard enough do it a second time, this would be good to do.  However to do this you would have to go back to the beginning of the dvd and redo the lot.  I think it should be sectioned.  I don't like the standing abs and really don't think it can be terribly effective.

However I do like her leg exercises and think with more direction it could be a good.",1222992000,3,589,3.907563025210084
3563595,4,B001F2HZHI,"Very different from other exercise videos in that Tracy doesn't act like a drill sergeant commanding you to do the reps, she doesn't smile cheesy smiles of encouragement.  She just does the work, all by herself.

There are problems, mainly with the direction and production choices.  There is no cueing.  You will have to watch it first a couple of times to see what she is doing.  She is wearing black and mainly against a black background so during her standing leg exercises it is hard to see whether she is extending her leg behind her or keeping it bent.  Eventually there is a camera angle from the side but until then it is impossible to know.

She doesn't count the reps but will occasionally say 'two more' or 'five more' and that's useless.

There are familiar, old, standard exercises here (standing donkey kicks, hydrants, lots of leg lifts). There are NO lunges, NO squats and only a few plies.  The leg exercises reminded me of those you see in issues of Shape mag or Fitness mag.

I love the arm section.  You have to decide whether you want cut, defined arms (think Jillian Michaels) or arms like Tracy. There are NO triceps dips, no kickbacks.  Lots of variations on arm circles. It's too soon to tell how effective the arm work will be but it feels great (and a little painful) to do.

The section with standing ab work is short.  The movements are very precise and you have to concentrate on the muscles you're using or you will just flail around and it will be useless.

The mat ab work isn't the best I've seen and I will probably end up substituting different ab work during that section.  As another reviewer said, it does look like Tracy is lifting her head with her hands.  You don't want your chin to go as close to your chest as hers does.  When doing ab work like this it helps to visualize holding an orange between your chin and your chest and to pick a point on the ceiling to focus on.

At $30 it is expensive but I can't think of another exercise video that has the same kind of vibe.  There is something serene and sensual about the workout that makes it enjoyable to do.  If any readers know of any videos with a similar vibe, please post the titles in the comments.

Also... if anyone has purchased Tracy's post pregnancy workout and the mat workout please post how they are different/similar.",1222905600,6,2329,4.456264775413712
3563596,4,B001F2HZHI,"I really like Tracy's mat workout. I love that there isn't lots of equipment required, and that the workout can all be done in a relatively small space. The background is spare and she is alone, giving the feeling of a private, personal session. Many reviewers noted that she doesn't talk very much, which I really like. Where other workouts rely on lots of people, loud music, and lots of chatter to give a sence of energy, Tracy's simple instructions and quiet direction feel calming and are an excellent compliment to the intense energy you expend trying to keep up with her. Because she is not constantly instructing, you quickly get a feel for what she wants you to do so as you get better, you could do it with the sound off if you wanted. The workout is difficult for me at my current fitness level (I am in fair shape, not great), so this DVD will challenge me for quite awhile. I would recommend this video to friends and look forward to further installments of her DVD series.",1222905600,4,986,4.483333333333333
3563597,3,B001F2HZHI,"I have a whole library of workout DVD's and this is by far the most expensive.  I think it's great at the most $15 but not $30.  She doesn't have anyone else in it.  Usually most DVD's will provide another instructor to show modifications if you can't do the actual move.  She doesn't lead you into the next moves and just goes there.  I'm sure after repetition of the DVD that won't be a problem.  I am sore after the workout so I think it is a good addition.  She says to only do her dance and mat 4-6 times/week but for someone who says repetition is a bad thing, I don't understand how doing the exact same workouts each day is going to make a big change.",1222905600,4,659,4.1015625
3563598,5,B001F2HZHI,"I go through a gym burn out phase every couple of years and this came along right at a good time for me.  Personally I thought it was a fun, different, and complete workout.  I do agree that a clip of the DVD's on her website would be great.  I just purchased the Dance Cardio DVD and hope I will like that as much.",1222819200,4,315,3.890625
3563599,2,B001F2HZHI,"Tracy Anderson may be on to a good thing but fails terribly in helping us know how to do it. She gives very little instruction on where to focus our movements, where we should be feeling the strain, where the movement should go. We need more information on every move so we know exactly what to do, not simply follow her endless repetitions & figure it out for ourselves. She could have provided a training session before the workout, explaining the method and movements. During the workout, she's very quiet where she should be talking and instructing those of us who have no idea of her method. It seems most good exercise programs come with lots of instruction, either in print, during the session or before the workout, such as Callanetics and Tae Bo where we are informed exactly what to do for best results. This type of information is crucial for a good work-out, especially something so different as Tracy's is. I took the chance and bought this DVD & hope I can figure it out but am irked that for the high price it wasn't more well done. Beware, it's not as good as it could be by far. She should have at least, for that price, printed a workout sheet diagramming the movements.

Another point Tracy doesn't get across is that one could be injured by overdoing the work, which is what happened to me. I've pulled or somehow damaged a muscle in my lower back which now makes walking painful. She stresses in parts of her workout to keep going regardless of how tired you get. This is not sensible so if you get this DVD, be mindful of how much you can do and listen to your body, not to her. Again, most expert workout instructors remind us not to exceed our limits. I forgot that. Tracy starts out the DVD by telling of her years of observation and work at perfecting this method so I trusted what she said was okay. And I got the idea that many repetitions of motion without weights wouldn't cause injury.

I hope also that this DVD will be redone to include chapters so that when one wants to focus on abs or arms, one doesn't have to fast forward the long way to the section one wants. For the high price, this should have been included.

This DVD is not Digital.

Overall, from my experience, this is not a good workout and you'd be better served to try something else.",1222732800,39,2283,4.402843601895735
3563600,5,B001F2HZHI,"I am so happy I ordered this.  I have known about Tracy for some time and after seeing her on Oprah was pleased to see there are DVD's available.

It is only Tracy doing the workout, which makes me feel more like I have a personal trainer.  Her directions and comments are appropriate and the music corresponds well to the moves.  The changes can be quick but with repeated viewings, I don't see a problem in picking them up.  It's much more graceful than any run-of-the-mill workout.  In fact, I would go so far as to call it ""purposeful movement"" rather than exercise.  I can definitely say it's something I will look forward to doing rather than dreading.  Also, there isn't a lot of babble and bubbly encouragement, which I'm grateful for.

I can't imagine a muscle that isn't worked during this routine.  It is a challenge and if you're just starting out, just do what you can and work your way up to it.  It will take me some time to be able to do it as effortlessly as Tracy does.

The contents of the Disc are: Mat Intro - 1:02, Mat Workout - 57:28 (Includes warm-up and cool-down), Gwyneth Interview - 0:56, Tracy Interview - 2:56.  You need a basic mat sized area, mat if you are on a hard surface, 3 lb weights and a chair. It starts with warm-up then standing legs, standing abs, standing arms, standing arms with weights, mat legs, mat abs then finishes with cool-down.

One caveat - During the floor ab work, make sure that your hands are simply supporting your head or there for placement rather than lifting it.  She does keep a distance between chin and chest and mentions it, but if you're not familiar with the move, it may appear that she is lifting her head with her hands a bit. Lifting the head rather than the upper body won't target the proper muscles and more importantly can cause neck strain or injury.

*I don't think there is any further instruction needed, the moves are simple & basic but the combination and amount is more than effective.",1222732800,280,1971,4.4636871508379885

She targets muscles you didn't know you had, not the typical biceps, triceps, quads and hammies.. all the tiny muscles that connect them - which when you think about it - is totally genius. The workouts are really tough, you will sweat - but you will also see great results if you stick with it. You can break it up and do the whole thing, or separate the workouts by target area, arms, legs, abs, etc. Totally works - the TA hype is REAL!
