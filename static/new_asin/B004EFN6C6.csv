4337005,5,B004EFN6C6,This is another great group that can bring a smile to your face when you hear the music. I was amazed that you can purchase one single whenever you want it. I am glad that amazon offer this type of service it is very convenient and not expensive. They also have the latest music in a lot of different varieties. Great music!!!!!!!!!!!!,1348704000,,335,4.419354838709677
4337006,5,B004EFN6C6,"This has to be one of the best works yet of the Rance Allen Group.  I bought  ""The Live Experience I"" and love it and thought it was the best, and I bought it for ""Something About the Name Jesus"", and there are so many other great songs on it as well.  I bought the ""Live Experience II""  for ""You that I Trust"" with Paul Porter and it is phonomenal and so are the other songs and artists such as Shirley Ceasar and Vanessa Bell Armstrong.  What can I say my grandchildren 12 & 15 watch this DVD all the time, we have to see who can get to it first. The spirit of this group you just cannot put into words.  Highly recommend the DVD and CD.  They just know how to celebrate the goodness of Jesus and help you renew your faith.",1322438400,,725,3.9930555555555554
4337007,5,B004EFN6C6,"I love the Rance Allen Group.  I have been listening to them for years.  My mother had a lot of
their albums, which I used to listen to when I was a child.  I always liked to listen to them
because their songs are always meaningful and speak to your soul.  I love the music as well.
Watching the Rance Allen Group perform is intriguing.  I would highly recommend this dvd because
it is verying uplifting and inspiring.  You will never get tired of looking at it!  The group knows
how to pull the audience into the experience.",1301011200,2,525,4.295918367346939

4337009,5,B004EFN6C6,I LOVE THIS NEW CD. IT GOES ALL THE WAY TO MY HEART AND SOUL.,1297123200,,61,3.1333333333333333
4337010,5,B004EFN6C6,"When the weight of the world sits hard on your shoulder along with your own personal distress, you won't go wrong owning this one.  The RAG has done it once again.  ""THIS LIVE EXPERIENCE II"" has left me spiritually reborned and motivated.  Now more so than ever, I ""FEEL LIKE GOING ON.""  I also enjoyed the wonderful anointing sounds of other gospel greats such as; Shirley Ceasar and Vanessa
Bell Armstrong just to name a few.  No one does it quite like The RAG.  Superbly Done!!!  This is truly a blessed combination of uplifting music.

Congratulations on 40 PLUS!!  May the Lord continue to bless your music ministry while you continue to keep a ""SMILE"" in our hearts.  Your's in Christ.
