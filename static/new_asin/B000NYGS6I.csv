I was a 15 year old gearhead and I fell in love with the '64 Chevelle in the movie. Years later, I could still remember the figure 8 street race and the long distance road race against a Porsche, a BMW, and an Alfa. The car went from primered street racer to full modified racer in the course of the movie. I didn't remember the acting or much of the plot, but I remembered that car. I searched for this movie for a long time and finally bought a used VHS. The car is still cool. The acting is ok. Veteran actor Logan Ramsey put on the best performance. The characters are painfully southern. I say that as a born and bred southerner and not in a negative way. Other southerners will understand. The plot is minimal. However, this movie has some of the best modified stock car racing scenes you will find anywhere. If you're a gearhead like me and you like get down and dirty vintage racing, then do yourself a favor and buy this tape.",1179619200,,1032,4.217171717171717
