8097073,5,B000CCD1XE,what a strange man.  I did not know that he was the one that owned the chateau where the Duke and Duchess of Windsor where married.  This dealer sent quickly.,1456790400,,158,4.233333333333333
8097074,5,B000CCD1XE,This is a fantastic true story and one you won't find in the history books. You won't be sorry you watched it; much better than the junk coming out of Hollywood today.,1407974400,,167,4.25
8097075,5,B000CCD1XE,More should be investigated on Charles Bedaux. Seems he knew what U.S. companies conspired with the 3rd Reich. Seems he may have been hidden from history on purpose.,1362441600,,165,4.928571428571429
8097076,4,B000CCD1XE,"I did enjoy learning some interesting stuff about what the political climate was really like during that time. It is amazing to think of nazis and jews and opposing sides all mixing together at social events in a kind of neutral ground, this guy's estate. and the rest of it is pretty bizarre and fun. ok i guess it was pretty good actually, but I wasn't blown away. also all the stuff about how he influenced the industrial system and helped to objectify the workers as basically machines was pretty fascinating. If you're biographical stuff and historical interest this is a hidden gem.",1360195200,,588,4.718446601941747
8097077,5,B000CCD1XE,"This is a look at a man that the history books have avoided including. He was a traitor and his name and story implicate too many companies.  A Canadian documentarian had the film and the courage to make this.  Badaux played the Nazis, the abdicated Duke of Windsor and the U.S all.  A real meglomanical and true character.  Highly Recommend.",1305072000,,342,4.65
8097078,5,B000CCD1XE,"This is a well detailed look at a very important man who is today all but unknown, yet who made a huge impact on the globe during his lifetime. The film intercuts the story of Bedaux's life with newly discovered film of a weird overland trek through Canada before his subsequent misadventures in WWII. The connection between the two events is scant, though, and the film doesn't really make enough of an effort to link the two. Still, this is an entertaining look at someone who lived a privileged life and who died under mysterious circumstances when he could have exposed the extent of US industry's involvement in subsidizing the Nazis.",1236902400,,639,4.7657657657657655
8097079,4,B000CCD1XE,"Describing a part of the incredible life of Charles Bedaux, it shows a lot of fabulous archive and relevant interviews.",1168473600,,119,5.0
