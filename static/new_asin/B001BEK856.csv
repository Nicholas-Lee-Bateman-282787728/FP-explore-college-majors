3490305,5,B001BEK856,"I was not that thrilled to buy yet another Thomas movie, but we are Pierce Brosnan fans and my three year old loves Thomas so I wanted to give it a try and I was not disappointed.

That said, I do think the beginning of the movie is a bit off.  Mr. Brosnan sounds a bit monotone, but he seems to pick up the pace and after a while you get caught up in the story about the great discovery (finding the town of Waterton).  They introduce a new engine named Stanley (so you can add that train to your growing collection) that my son has not stopped talking about since he saw the movie.  Also, the Thomas Theme song at the end is updated and is pretty catchy.  A good buy for any Thomas fan.",1224201600,2,688,4.029411764705882
3490306,5,B001BEK856,"This is a great movie!  Pierce Brosnon is an excellent narrator as well - you can tell he has read these to his children!  It is a very good story line about the old town of great waterton, and such great and amazing perils that Thomas goes through.  Very exciting and fun.",1223856000,3,273,4.211538461538462
3490307,5,B001BEK856,"My daughter is six years old. She is a giant Thomas fan. This movie is the greatest. We both loved it. We also love the music cd that came with the dvd. It is so neat. My daughter listens to the music while playing with her trains. We are very, very pleased with this product.

3490308,5,B001BEK856,"Definitely a must have for thomas the tank engine collection, Pierce Bronson does a superb narration, the stories and the direction was great, and the music was AWESOME!  Whoever is singing the song at the end of the dvd has completely changed the familiar thomas the train song and gave it a catchy hip-hop tune which fits perfectly with the musical genre of today.  Must buy it, you won't be disappointed. (^o^)",1221696000,12,413,4.722222222222222
3490309,5,B001BEK856,"I was reluctant to buy another Thomas movie for fear that my 4 year old will make me watch it over, and over, and over...but I'm glad we got this! It's a great movie and I just LOVE the song at the end! Pierce Brosnan does a great job with all the voices. I'm VERY glad we got this and look forward to watching it again and again...(which I'm sure I'll have to!!)",1221436800,22,363,3.9863013698630136
3490310,5,B001BEK856,Great movie both my sons love this movie they can't stop watching it. I have to say i even enjoy watching it and i usually don't care to watch movies by Thomas & Friends. It was a great story and the music was really great my boys love to sing along. I recommend this movie to every Thomas & Friends fan.. I give it 5 stars..,1221264000,,325,3.9393939393939394
3490311,5,B001BEK856,"We saw this movie in the theater (it is showing in July in various states).  The screenplay was really well written and the movie was really well done.  Pierce Brosnan is a superb narrator and does some really great engine voices; he is the best Thomas narrator yet.  Even my husband enjoyed it, and he generally dislikes watching Thomas (I think it was partly the James Bond connection with Pierce, and partly how well the movie was done).  The storyline: Thomas accidentally discovers an abandoned town on Sodor. A new engine (Stanley) is called in to do Thomas' work while Thomas supervises the restoration of the discovered town ...Stanley is a really nice, fun, hard-working engine and doesn't mean any ill will whatsoever towards Thomas....and Thomas ends up becoming very jealous of Stanley and how well he works and gets along with the other engines & characters (including Percy and Annie & Clarabel).  By the end of the movie Stanley and Thomas become friends and both can see how the other engine must have felt.  Great starting point for discussing jealousy and how to handle it with your preschooler.",1216512000,61,1113,4.862433862433862

It has the models and the narrator (Pierce Brosnan does quite well). The storyline, while full of lapses in logic, was entertaining for all of us. It was nice to watch a Thomas movie without the pathetic dialogue that we discovered in the newer ones (King of the Railway, Blue Mountain Quarry, or even the more recent episode collections). The Great Discovery is worth watching again!",1446163200,,532,4.731182795698925

3490473,4,B001BEK856,"This is one of the last non-CGI Thomas productions, and one of the last to feature a single storyteller instead of a voice cast for each character. This captures the traditional charm of the show and feels more authentic. It's like your imagination bringing a story to life as it's being read, as opposed to a CGI adventure.

The story is strong. Thomas overcomes his jealousy of a new, popular engine with the usual unlikely-but-not-impossible story elements. It's a journey tale, both of self discovery and literally across (and under) Sodor.

This is one of my children's favorite Thomas stories, and show. It's a good length at about an hour. The songs won't drive you crazy when little ones sing them on and off for days and days.",1398729600,,735,4.734375

If I'm forced to watch a kid's movie, I prefer it to be Thomas the Train over many of the other crappy cartoons/shows out there. Our son isn't a huge fan of the ""non talking"" Thomas but really liked this one. The story was very good- Thomas stumbles upon the abandoned town of Great Waterton and is then put in charge of it's restoration. Stanley, a new engine, is brought it to take over Thomas's branch line. Thomas becomes jealous of Stanley and his friendships with the other engines which leads to trouble. While trying to be a ""really useful engine"" again Thomas gets lost down an old mine and is eventually found by Stanley. A great message overall. The updated song at the end is pretty catchy too. The downsides to this movie are Pierce Bronson and the songs. Pierce does a good job narrating but is terrible with the engine voices. Too dull and boring. I'm not a fan of the narrated episodes in general though. The songs during the movie are cute but far too long. The movie could be much shorter and too the point without the songs dragging.",1359244800,,1131,4.390476190476191

Now he has to ask me why whats wrong. Why does everything, be it kids commercials for toys or cereal, or whatever, have to have rap in it. Its forced down everybodys throats from hollywood and families that don't want their kid exposed to that style of music are subjected to it. Well, I am ashamed of HIT for this decision. It could have been placed in ""special features"" and to top it off, it loops over and over until you do something with the remote.

With that said, we own about 8 of these and this one is by far the best!!! I can't stress that enough. Two new songs we haven't heard before and video of movie with the songs after. My three year old ask me to dance with him everytime the main song comes on. HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES this one the most. Lots of action and a great storyline as well.

Well, The Great Discovery held his attention for about 15 minutes, then he walked out.  I can't say I blame him, really.  I was dissappointed, to say the least.

First, Pierce Brosnan.  He's a great Bond, but a lousy narrator.  After listening to him, my wife said, ""It sounds like he's being forced to do it.""  In my opinion, he tried too hard to make it work.  Sadly, it didn't.

Some parts of the movie were just downright phony.  An engine falling into the water and doesn't sink?  An engine flying across a chasm?  Oh, and just happens to skid to a halt next to a railroad track?  (How convenient!)

The plot worked, although it did get a bit mushy in places.  Sir Topham Hatt declaring an island-wide State of Emergency after Thomas disappears? That's a bit overboard.

I did like the minature work the producers did on Great Waterton.  The models were very impressive.  The new engine Stanley is a good addition.  The other engines are marking time.  Jeremy the Jet makes a cameo.  Personally, I think the producers were just cranking out one last Thomas in minature until they perfected their CGI.

I could do without the Rap version of the Thomas theme song.  The last thing we need gangsterized is Thomas and Friends.

Give 2-year olds credit.  They know what's good.  Unfortunately, this DVD now makes a great bookend.

Save your money.  Buy ""Hero of the Rails"" instead.",1272153600,11,1600,4.574468085106383

Though longer than the usual Thomas my 3 year old did not get bored and amazed me by sitting through the whole thing in rapt concentration.",1235433600,2,402,4.302631578947368

3490727,4,B001BEK856,"I waited for this movie and my son and I went and bought it the first day it was out! We wanted so much for this to be the best Thomas ever. Well, it's good - I mean really good, but I'm sorry, Pierce Brosnan is not the right person to do the voiceover. OK, that's just my opinion and I'm not even sure whether my 3-yr-old agrees or not.

Brosnan sounds like he is doing toddler Shakespeare. He is a little over the top for me. There are moments when this works and others where it would be nice to be a little more ""story-like."" What do I mean? Well, it's the difference between a good actor and a great actor. I don't want to think about the narrator while I'm watching a Thomas episode. I want him to just BE there, reading it really well. Even Ringo pulled this off and I never thought it possible.

All that said, the movie is great - lots of thrills and plots. And of course we all learn great lessons as we resolve the issues of the day. I wouldn't miss it for the world; I would just prefer another narrator.

We have seen the current PBS episodes, with the new computer graphics, and Brosnan is not the narrator. Does anyone know the story?

3490731,5,B001BEK856,"When I saw this in the theaters,I was amazed at how Thomas toppled over and went through the mine. Overall,the movie was the best in the series. Pierce Brosnan was a CLASSIC narrator for Thomas. He added a lot of warmth when he narrated the story. The Thomas You're The Leader song at the end of the movie was an awesome song! The song was a hit with me! But the whole movie did make me wonder,why did they treat the Thomas model so bad?!?

But if your a Thomas fan out there,BUY THIS MOVIE!",1229299200,,491,4.168421052631579
8282915,4,B001BEK856,"This movie was a major improvement from Calling all Engines. This movie had a good narrator (Pierce Brosnan). The plot was good and reminded me of Toy Story which was the feud between Woody and Buzz. This the same only with the feud between Thomas and the new character for the movie Stanley. Stanley is still bland and does not do much to this day. This movie had good scenes like the mine scene. The songs are good at best and bad at worst. Thomas and James are racing was a good song. Where oh Where is Thomas is not good, Especially for the line ""The children get a day off school to hunt for you know who"". What kind of Education does Sodor have right there. Jobs a plenty and Thomas Your the Leader were good as well. However when Thomas returned from the works, Sir Topham Hatt said Stanley will be in charge while Thomas will help him. Who found Great Waterton. (By the way Great Waterton looks Great). It was Thomas.  Just because Stanley did a good job while Thomas was away, Sir Topham Hatt said Stanley will be in charge, that was rude. Aside from that The Great Discovery was a good movie, not the best but still good.",1505606400,,1131,4.309859154929577

But they meld them all into a single cohesive story.

The animation is the older style of Thomas with the actual model trains. But the camera work is a step up from the earliest Thomas episodes that used static cameras. This one has moving camera angles so it brings more depth to the animation.

It's a really good 1 hour Thomas story. My kids enjoyed it for a special movie night. The actual run time of the movie itself is 55 minutes. Past that it's the Thomas theme song again then credits.",1480032000,,934,6.1692307692307695
