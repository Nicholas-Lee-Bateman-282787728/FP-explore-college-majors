3762675,3,B001Q3KR8A,"I DID NOT ENJOY THIS DVD AS MUCH AS I ENJOYED THE ONE DONE BY CBS. THIS ONE SHOWED TOO MUCH OF THE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE INAUGURATION, NONE OF THE PARADE ROUTE WAS SHOWN.  TOO MUCH TIME WAS SPENT ON WATCHING BUSH TAKE OFF IN THE HELICOPTER, THEN THE TAPE ENDS ABRUPTLY.",1238976000,,270,4.09433962264151
3762676,1,B001Q3KR8A,"I bought this because I recorded it live on my DVR and wanted to have it in my collection rather than saving 7 hours on my DVR.  However, CNN did a very poor job in the transfer.  The picture clarity is poor, it's not in stereo, nor are the captions complete.  Most of the captions are clipped at the edges.  One would think that with the money CNN has, they'd do a better job transferring video to DVD, especially with a monumental and historic event like this.",1238716800,6,462,4.275862068965517
3762677,3,B001Q3KR8A,The video runs less than two hours from arrival of Bush and Obama at Capitol Hill to departure of Bush on helicopter.  Would have preferred if video had been longer and covered more pre-inauguration activities and/or part of the presidential parade.,1237420800,5,249,5.073170731707317
3762678,2,B001Q3KR8A,I was extremely disappointed.  The coverage began in the middle of a conversation.  There was no prologue or introducation.,1236470400,3,123,5.421052631578948
3762679,1,B001Q3KR8A,Obama DVD weak and not very good quality. I saw better news clips during the campaign. I expected a more in-depth look and should have just burned the DVR home version...my husband creates a more creative and professional DVD.,1236211200,7,226,4.82051282051282
3762680,5,B001Q3KR8A,A very good job from Amazon once again. I wasn't able to see the inauguration LIVE so this CNN coverage is great from all angles.,1235520000,2,129,4.2
3762681,2,B001Q3KR8A,"I previously sent in my review, as did a number of others. All pre-Feb 18 reviews have been removed by amazon.com",1235001600,3,113,4.428571428571429
3762682,4,B001Q3KR8A,"I received my copy of the CNN inaugural coverage and it was fine.  Pristine, clear copy and many of the touching, poignant moments were captured, so I say GOOD JOB as always, AMAZON!  As for the extensive coverage of PRESIDENT OBAMA, blame the media or GET OVER IT!  Those who think he's the anti-Christ need to really search history and their own souls!  To paraphrase what the President himself says - ""...what the naysayers don't seem to get is that it has never been about ME; it's about you (meaning us..we, the people).  Try becoming a part of the solution - no one man can do it alone, but we should give our new President some support or some viable options to consider (without the malice and hatred!).",1234915200,21,711,4.5234375

8334969,1,B001Q3KR8A,"Well, President Obama has been elected  TWO  TIMES,  so unknowingly I ordered the above Inaurugation of Barack Obama on CNN.

I t wasn't until I received it and started watching that I realized some smart alec was selling the inauguration from four years ago to idiots like me.",1361923200,,277,4.708333333333333
8334970,5,B001Q3KR8A,This video captures the historic events of the Inauguration of Barack Obama.  I really enjoy watching it.  A great video to keep.,1360454400,,129,4.818181818181818
8334971,5,B001Q3KR8A,CNN's coverage of the first inauguration of President Barack Obama is superb!  Plan to buy the 2013 version as soon as it is available.,1358726400,,135,4.625
8334972,3,B001Q3KR8A,"If you just want to see the inauguration without any foreword or in-depth historical significance, then you'll probably be satisfied with this DVD.  The entrance of all the major political figures to the platform (about 1/2 hour before Obama arrives on the platform) is shown.  However, if you wish to have more commentary of historical signifcance and a review of the importance of this election to African Americans and Black/American history, then you'd also want to see the USA Today DVD of inauguration.",1245715200,,508,5.108433734939759
8334973,2,B001Q3KR8A,"Poor production, lots of missing pieces. Besides Obama's speech, everything else is incomplete. The seven minutes ""Obamas' walk"" during the parade was also cut half. I was really disappointed by CNN's poor production based on what I saw on CNN doing the inauguration day. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.",1243296000,2,292,4.979591836734694
8334974,1,B001Q3KR8A,"not worth the time or money. considering the amount of coverage by cnn
this dvd was amature and poorly done",1240012800,,107,4.4
8334975,1,B001Q3KR8A,"I was very shocked that CNN did not create a better video for DVD release of the events on Inauguration Day.  THe DVD begins somewhat awkward and it also ends awkward and abrupt.  There was no coverage of the parade or any of the Inauguaral Balls.  The DVD copy I received also stops several times during play.  I was very disappointed in this purchase.  I also purchased the DVD's from CBS, ABC, NBC and USA Today which were better than the CNN DVD.  I must say the USA Today DVD was my favorite.",1239667200,10,497,4.290322580645161
