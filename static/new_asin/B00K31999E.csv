8655521,5,B00K31999E,"As a fan of the HTTYD franchise I actually enjoy the tv series.  While the quality doesn't match that of the movie the story line is quite enjoyable nonetheless.  I've seen all the episodes on tv and on the internet, but I wanted to get my hands on the DVD set just for the sake of supporting  Dreamworks and also its nice to own HD quality version of the episodes too.  The idea that the first season came out in one bundle and in an adorable case was just a huge bonus for me and the main reason why I bought this particular product was for the Toothless case alone.  Pretty neat, how you can fold his wings and tail out and stand him up on the shelf for display.  Very unique in itself since I've never seen another DVD set pull off something quite as awesome as this one.  Great show overall and can't wait for the DVD release for season 3 to come out.",1444694400,,856,4.120481927710843

8655526,5,B00K31999E,"The whole family enjoys the Riders of Berk as well as How To Train Your Dragon 1 and 2. Riders of Berk, Complete First Season was purchased for my grand son as a Christmas gift.. It comes in a ""Toothless the Dragon"" case. The dragon's tail pulls out to allow the case to be placed on display... very clever and very cute. My grand son,after opening many gifts,seemed particularly delighted with this little case and its contents. This would make a great collectors item too.(7-6-15)I wanted to buy the same item for myself and finally did just that a couple weeks ago. The little Toothless dragon is on display next to my bedroom TV. Both shipped quickly and with no damage.",1420156800,4,674,4.578512396694215
