8247867,5,B0012TZPDA,"I really enjoyed this movie back when it came out.  It's a collection of interviews of many of the interesting characters living in Everett Massachusetts.

I wish it were available so that I could see it again and watch it with my friends.

I did not grow up in Everett and have probably only been there a couple times, yet I still enjoyed this film, just as I enjoyed ""On the Road With Charles Kuralt"", and ""Roadside Stories"".  They introduce us to interesting people we'd not meet otherwise.",1511740800,,493,4.568181818181818
8247868,5,B0012TZPDA,"This movie was made long before ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" made its popularity. Midburb is the original, hilarious look at how we live and the traditions we stand for. I laughed from the beginning to the end. The best part is, the characters are real people!",1217376000,,258,4.51063829787234
