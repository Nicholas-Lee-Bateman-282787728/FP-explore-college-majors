3946665,3,B002LFPAGQ,"Great source of background and information, but the video presentation looks like something of a high school project. If you can get by the ""easy"" frames, the content is worth absorbing.",1379548800,4,186,5.032258064516129
3946666,5,B002LFPAGQ,This dvd has a really interesting concept: a background profile on a fictional character. I wasn't sure what to expect but I must say the film makers did an admirable job that kept me interested for the duration.  Sherlock Holmes has always been fascinating and this brought yet another dimension to the stories,1368835200,4,311,4.867924528301887
3946667,5,B002LFPAGQ,"I always liked the Holmes stories although I can't say I have read every one of them. This was a cool video that explored the back story and theories about Watson. Is he Doyle's alter ego? I don't know, but this was entertaining.",1367280000,,229,4.348837209302325
3946668,4,B002LFPAGQ,I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan so this video holds a special place in my heart. This fills the void of information on Dr. Watson in an impressive way. They hit the ball out of the park here.,1357516800,,189,4.0
3946669,4,B002LFPAGQ,"Being a true Sherlock Holmes fan, I enjoyed this video a lot. There are some great film clips here and they really go in depth. I woiuld recommend it to my fellow fans.",1357084800,,168,4.121212121212121
3946670,2,B002LFPAGQ,"This was not a story or interesting material, it was more of a film history lesson Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, DR Watson. It would be great for a film history class at a university. Interesting for the first 15 minutes then it went down hill. This is the second video I have bought that were not as advertised. If you have the money has time to waste go for it.",1325548800,,357,4.114285714285714
3946671,4,B002LFPAGQ,"When I really like a subject I try to learn all about it, which is why I watched Elementary, My Dear Watson: The Man Behind Sherlock Holmes. I've always loved watching Sherlock Holmes films on TV.  This great detective could probably find a dead flea and find out exactly how it died, who did it, and what weapon was used!  But...he wouldn't have been nearly as interesting without his sidekick Watson.  Without Watson to ask questions or be there to bounce ideas off, Sherlock Holmes would have been only half as great.  Watson always reminded me of the little voice inside everyone's head that urges them to think deeper, find other answers, and uncover the truth.

Although Watson is a fictional character, for Holmes lovers he's as real as the next person.  The film also goes into the possibility of Watson being Conan Doyle's alter-ego, Holmes' use of mood altering drugs, and other interesting facts, along with a lot of great footage and clips.",1274486400,10,952,4.774390243902439
3946672,4,B002LFPAGQ,"It's a bit odd to watch a biography of a fictional character, but that's exactly what this is, a bio of Sherlock Holmes' side-kick, Doctor Watson.  I'm also not sure how important or even interesting it is to try to figure out who the inspiration for the character was in real life.

But that aside, this DVD is a joy to watch, with ample clips from a wide variety of Sherlock Holmes movies.  There's Nigel Bruce as a stiff, bumbling Watson, and later attempts by other actors to rehabilitate the character.

Conan Doyle wrote four novels and 56 short stories about Holmes and Watson and most are narrated by Watson, so it's not surprising that Conan Doyle and Watson are closely related in the reader's mind.

The similarity between Watson and Conan Doyle himself is remarkable.  They were both physicians and both served in the far corners of the Empire.  To some degree all of the characters in a novel are the author's alter-ego, so I'm not sure Watson is Conan Doyle any more than Holmes is.

The DVD doesn't shy away from Holmes' use of mood-altering drugs, nor of Watson's facilitation of Holmes' habit.  And since there were some 260 movies, ballets and musicals made from the Holmes/Watson characters, the DVD spends some time separating the original novels from the material made from them.",1272758400,19,1300,4.742222222222222
3946673,4,B002LFPAGQ,The disc arived in a timely manner and appears to be in good condition.  It is for a gift so I have not watched it yet.,1261267200,,119,3.576923076923077
3946674,4,B002LFPAGQ,"This is a really cool, well-produced look at the lesser known but ever-present character of the Conan Doyle novels. Lots of film clips and detail culled from the novels and short stories.",1258761600,11,187,4.875
8372925,5,B002LFPAGQ,"I really enjoyed reading how Sherlock and Dr. Watson met and how they worked together on their cases.""",1484697600,,102,4.722222222222222
8372926,3,B002LFPAGQ,"Good information, old fashioned film with really annoying score. I think their special effects person got carried away.",1459209600,,119,5.666666666666667
8372927,3,B002LFPAGQ,Not a really good addition to my Sherlock library.,1458604800,,50,4.666666666666667
8372928,2,B002LFPAGQ,overly edited with amateur graphics and animation. Unnecessary anti-climatic music playing constantly. A decent baseline of facts presented but not much else worth watching for. No interviews with critics or researchers of Doyle/Holmes. Only Narrator present.,1457913600,,259,6.222222222222222
8372929,5,B002LFPAGQ,"Very interesting. I am a big, Sherlock fan",1454544000,,42,4.375
8372930,3,B002LFPAGQ,I love Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson history and information about the characters and their author.,1454112000,,100,5.3125
8372931,4,B002LFPAGQ,Interesting documentary for those who like Sherlock Holmes and his creator,1439078400,,74,5.818181818181818
8372932,1,B002LFPAGQ,"If you're looking for an in-depth documentary into the influences and personalities behind the creation of Dr. Watson, keep looking.  If you're looking into the influence of the Spiritualism movement on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, you've found the right spot.  Heavy on artsy photography and music.  Lean on documentary information.",1419811200,3,328,5.52
8372933,2,B002LFPAGQ,Poorly done,1418083200,,11,5.0
8372934,1,B002LFPAGQ,"This is not about Watson. The producers try to make the case that Watson is basically A. Conan Doyle, then go on and on, frequently repeating the same points, blathering about Doyle and his interest in the supernatural. This film co. seems to be all about psychic/mystical phenomena, UFO, conspiracy theories and the like (to judge by the montage of their other titles I had to sit thru before the movie started) and they spent far more time talking about Freemasons and Rosicrucians--indeed, more time on Houdini--than they spent talking about Watson, and what they did say about him was sketchy and baldly stated without any reference for substantiation.
A lot of ""Could it be that...?"" with little attempt to prove their points.
My reactions as I watched alternated between ""This is news to no one"" and ""This is utter twaddle,"" or words to that effect. Far from satisfactory.",1388188800,9,878,4.899328859060403
