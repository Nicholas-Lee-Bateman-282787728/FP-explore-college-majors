8405265,5,B003TLMORO,This is an interesting show that unfortunately is been edited to a duration less than an hour. With that in consideration the quality of the Music and Sound is really Nice.  Steve starts opening with Camino Royal from album Highly Strung then plays songs of the album Guitar Noir which was touring at the moment . He also plays some very nice acoustic set and ends with classics Genesis track and Clocks in an Awesome performance ! All I can say is a very pleasant dvd but the listener Wishes there were more songs included on this dvd ! Conclusion buy with confidence if you are a real fan of Steve Hacket the Maestro !,1331424000,3,620,4.391304347826087
