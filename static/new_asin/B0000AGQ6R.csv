1905398,5,B0000AGQ6R,"Man this movie was so frikin funny!  Man I'm glad I got there early cuz this movie got soled out!
MTV's Jamie Kennedy plays Brad Gluckman, son of a wealthy man (Ryan O'Neal) who is running for governor. Brad and his friends are posers (sometimes known as wiggers) who adopt the clothing, slang, and outlook of black rappers from the poorest and most violent communities. He insists on being called B-Rad, and has made a demo album called ""Mali-booty.""
This is an embarrassment to the campaign, so the candidate's political advisor (Blair Underwood) hires two clasically trained actors to pretend to be real gangstas and ""scare the black out of"" Brad and turn him back into acting like Richie Cunningham (from television's ""Happy Days""). The actors (Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson), despite the fact that rap style is even more foreign to them than it is to residents of Malibu.",1050710400,4,878,4.8533333333333335

1905551,4,B0000AGQ6R,"Wow, Jamie Kennedy is good...almost too good. From vocal mannerisms, to actions, Kennedy's imitation of black thug culture is devastatingly accurate. He comes off looking like a brainless buffoon.

Meanwhile, many blacks in this movie are the voice of reason. Thank God! Even though I was amazed and impressed by Kennedy's portrayal, it gets tiresome eventually simply because thug behavior is naturally tiresome.

In the end, we learn that Kennedy is indeed dumb, ghetto, but of course has a heart of gold. OK, I'm a sucker for happy endings.

It's a bit dated, but still funny. Give this movie a try. you'll like it!",1377734400,,618,4.923076923076923

Jamie Kennedy gives classic comedic performance, and great comedic memes, ""...traffic, traffic, looking for my chapstick...""  Bo Derrick and Ryan O'Neil are a great supporting team as Jamie's parents.  We love Jamie's Malibu crew, Chandra is perfection, and the premise is silly enough to keep us coming back for more giggles.",1376697600,3,489,5.0875

1905555,4,B0000AGQ6R,"Clearly I'm the target market for this film...a 55 year old white male :) But Jamie Kennedy as B-Rad brought out his hilarious inner black man, and mine!  Ryan O'Neal is perfectly cast as his estranged and very white father, Bill Glickman, who is running for the Governorship of CA. B-Rads insistence that he is a gangsta rappa and belongs with his ""homeys"" in the hood is very embarrassing for the campaign. In an attempt to make him realize what a poser he is, the campaign has him ""kidnapped"" and brought to the hood by Sean and PJ (Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson) actors who have no business in South LA either. There outtakes are worth the price of admission. Love interest Shondra (Regina Hall) is fun as Kennedy's ""straight man"". My favorite scene is B-Rad talking over his problems with the mouse.",1374105600,,806,4.636363636363637

I don't think anyone actually looked at the trailer for this film and thought that it was destined to be hilarious. I mean, I wanted to see it and even I knew that there was a very large chance I was going to cringe at every joke and basically hate this movie.

The thing is, it really works.

The basic plot is pretty familiar. A political candidate is ashamed of his white son's fixation with being black. Brad (known to his peeps as B-Rad) wants to be ghetto and so he throws around slang words and wears his pants at his knees and pretty much shames his entire family. So, his father hires some actors to pretend to be `from the hood' and scare Brad into being white again. Things backfire when Brad gets the upper hand and actually starts pitting their own game against them. Toss in some real gangsters and you have a pretty funny farce on the craze affecting many young ones today. Some of the jokes don't land as well as others (the `8 Mile' spoof scene was ill advised and ill executed) but the majority of them hit pretty hard actually.

Jamie Kennedy is hilarious here, and Anthony Anderson (always been a fan) and Taye Diggs nail their roles as effeminate actors who are posing even more so than B-Rad.

It's a fun ride with some great jokes that makes this film far more than expected. Sure, this isn't a smart comedy by any means, and while it tries to present us with a message or moral of sorts, it's not like this is one of those comedies that really `says something' but for a mindless romp through racial stereotypes that actually colors those familiar jokes with some resemblance of class, `Malibu's Most Wanted' fits the bill rather nicely.",1354147200,,1743,4.454545454545454

I wanted to comment on the packaging. MMW was originally released in Warner Bros' awful cardboard ""snapcase"", where the whole right side is a plastic hinge (and gets in the way of whatever DVD you have next to it). So I bought this version, which is in the standard ""keepcase"" or clamshell with the art insert under clear plastic.

And while I'm sure most people who like movies like this could not care less, I just wanted to tell you that the keepcase version (provided by Frugal City) is Canadian, with French translation all over the art. So it says ""Le Truand de Malibu"" next to Anthony Anderson's head on the front and on the spine, and the synopsis paragraph and review quotes are also translated.

That's it. Disc/movie is the same: widescreen; English or French dialogue; English, French or Spanish subtitles; commentary, deleted scenes, alternate ending, trailer.

However, if you were after a film with a shred of dignity or a drop of coherent comedy, then you might want to search elsewhere.

Mostly we witness a stream of sex jokes, anatomical references, and unfunny observations about how people of different ethnicities relate to one another.  Really, there is nothing here that hasn't been done before, and with a lot more wit.  Jaime Kennedy's performance is especially bad, to the point that he almost seemed high during much of the filming.  The part where he was speaking with Tony Hawk, especially, came across as pointless and muddled, with Mr. Hawk carrying the dialogue.  You got the impression that Mr. Kennedy wanted to be somewhere else, anywhere else.

Even scenes where it felt as though the film was backing into an attempt at social commentary were almost always ruined by cheap gags, such as the spoof on video-gamers masturbating to game characters.  Quality humor this is not.",1308873600,,1154,5.068783068783069

This was a rather simple, formulaic film reminiscent of Hollywood in the 80s. However, I was completely surprised that I enjoyed the film, and found myself laughing at several points.

I don't want to come off as being bigoted, but I'm very, very puzzled as to why some cultures immitate, if not emulate, others - especialy when what the imitating culture is doing fits them about as well as a size 2 dress fits a four hundred pound woman. I don't think for one second that Jamie Kennedy believed that ""B-Rad"" was exactly who he was, even though the film ended with what seemed like acceptance. It was a complete mockery of said imitation, and Kennedy did a good job of demonstrating how poorly he (and thus an entire culture) wore his ""behavior"" because, simply put, he just looked silly.

That said, we know that B-Rad was K-Fed. And K-Fed is, frankly, the biggest joke on the planet. That did increase the enjoyment considerably.

I wonder if K-Fed knew this character was modeled after him, and that it was mocking him. I doubt it. He's not that smart.",1112400000,5,1067,4.6
1905602,3,B0000AGQ6R,"Jamie Kennedy nailed this one on the head.  ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" exposes a part of our society that has become increasingly annoying over the years:  White kids with wealthy parents who think that just because they wear ""urban"" clothes and listen to hip-hop, they are somehow ""street.""  Others have picked on Eminem for doing this, but that guy actually lived in a rough neighborhood in tough confines.  He has ""street"" cred.  Most of these other punks wouldn't know what it's like to be poor, untrusted, even hated, because of their social status or skin color.  It's these same kids whose parents bail them out every time they wreck their Navigator or Escalade they mommy bought for them.

In this social comedy, Kennedy plays B-Rad, a wealthy Jewish kid whose father is running for governor.  B-Rad ""drops rhymes"" and ""represents"" the best of Malibu.  He thinks he's ""street,""  all the while driving around in a vehicle with vanity plates, a fancy sound system, etc.  He hangs out with his ""crew"" at the Malibrew coffee house.  B-Rad's father entrusts his son's unusual behavior to his campaign manager, who promptly hires two professionally trained actors to ""scare"" B-Rad white again.  Unfortunately, the dynamic duo he chose are perhaps ""whiter"" than B-Rad.  They are played with great comic timing by Anthony Anderson and Taye Diggs.  Some of the best parts of the film are when these two play out the stereotypical ""white"" side of hip-hop by asking the DJ at a hardcore rap club if he has any Will Smith to get ""jiggy"" with.  Another hilarious scene involves a Korean family protecting their shop in Compton.

The obvious intention of this film is to expose racial stereotypes and make them comedic in the process.  For instance, when B-Rad's crew decides to go save him, they each go home and get their parents' biggest gat.  It's funny when the Arab character comes out with a bazooka given to him by an uncle back in the homeland.

Perhaps unintentionally, this film shows that just because a person is black or just because they are poor, doesn't mean that they aren't aware of the world around them.  When a gang, the ""I-9's,"" abduct B-Rad, they mention that they are voting for his father in the election.

In all, this film makes some very valid points about stereotypes.  It also shows the viewer that just because someone is a certain color or race or religion, never underestimate what they are capable of.  It is also very funny.  It utilizes stereotypes in a comedic fashion just as much as in a social way.  Lastly, it shows people just how silly they look when the pretend to be something that they aren't.",1109894400,7,2630,4.763274336283186

1905610,4,B0000AGQ6R,"Jamie Kennedy is the bomb! Malibu's Most Wanted could have used some work but Kennedy plays the lead character with style and keeps you laughing when the film gets its worse.  I've always liked Jamie since Scream because of his unique comedic style. He never ceases to amaze. In Malibu's Most Wanted Jamie gives the audience a lot to think about AND laugh at.
B-Rad ( Kennedy ) becomes the subject of a brutal joke. His father ( Ryan O'Neal ) inlists his campaign manager ( Blair Underwood ) to help him deal with his son. The problem is O'Neal's running for office and B-Rad's hip-hop antics are costing him votes. Thus, the kidnap plot of the year begins. And may I say it was a very funny and unique plot. We present Anthony Anderson and Taye Diggs ( two of the most popular black actors today ) playing actors. They know as much about the 'hood as B-Rad does so when they are hired to play gangstas and kidnap B-Rad the comedy really starts. They bring in a sistah, Shondra ( Regina Hall )to tempt B-Rad and she does just that. He ends up falling head over heels in love with her. Shondra finds herself attracted to him as well and why not? Jamie's hot whether he's white or black. I thought the transformation Anderson and Diggs did from actors to criminals was one of the funniest in the film but stands behind B-Rad hands down. Jamie rocked the house and though the film was cliched and stereotypical, you get a lot of laughs. I was hoping the film would stay original but it ended up being another Bringing Down The House, except Malibu's Most Wanted had more intelligence when it came to its audience. It didn't try to insult by having a bunch of black people do stupid things. What it did was educate in its own way showing that hip hop can truly be a culture of many flavors and can be used to bring people together. It may seem sappy but in the end you get a nice, multicultural comedy filled with interracial romance, rap stars, talking rats, bumping and grinding and all around fun.  In the end B-Rad learns more about himself than he thought he would and so do we.
I think this film is worth a look and believe me, I love intelligent films. This film may not be the calibur of Hamlet but it wasn't supposed to be. I think people forget that this was a COMEDY, a film to watch to have a good time. You don't always have to have a film that's socially and politically correct. I'm a black woman and nothing in this film offended me. I appreciated the effort and loved the fresh spin on how blacks and whites relate to hip hop. This may not be your cup of tea and that's fine. But as Jamie Kennedy says in the film "" Don't be hatin' "" which is a fine line if you think about it. Especially if you haven't given the movie a true chance.  I'd just watch it all over again for Jamie if nothing else. He is so fine.  Give the film a chance and draw your own conclusions.",1081641600,2,2878,4.2655677655677655

I wouldn't own it, but my kids do and it's not all that bad of a flick.  It's mostly a coming of age morality tale and the message it sends is mostly good and wholesome.

1905616,4,B0000AGQ6R,"Malibu's Most Wanted was for the most part silly and rather dumb but it was hilarious and for that I give it 4 stars, the one star deducted is for the amount reasonable silliness in this film.
  Jamie Kennedy plays B-Rad, a white kid who thinks he's a rapper and is not whtie.  He thinks he's slick, cool and gifted, yet he's horrific when it comes to rapping with his bad rhyming and pathetic lyrics.  His father, a candidate running for governor of California doesn't want his son to ruin his campaign and so he requests his campaign manager (Blair Underwood) to hire two actors (hilarious Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson) to scare the black out of his son and simply make him white.  Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson try to be two ganster-like characters from the hood who are trying to make B-Rad realize that he can obviously never be black or be a rapper.  Regina King plays Anderson's counsin Shondra and soons becomes the love interest of B-Rad, which could set a bit of distraction.  The premise of this movie does sound rather unintelligent and is the least bit clever but it's an amiable farce loaded with laughs.  Director John Whitesell can coax out laughs here.  The main charaters behind the immense laughter here are Diggs and Anderson,  who pulled off there characters well and did look a bit convincing in their roles.  Kennedy alongside has his laughs as well.
  Malibu's Most Wanted is rated PG-13 for Sexual Humor, Language and Violence.  The language is rather excessive with the frequent use of a certain b-word.  There is a sufficient amount of sexual innuendo, not explicit though.  The violence is infrequent and understated, mainly some bloodless gunplay and brief fistfights.  Worth owning, or atleast renting.  DVD includes deleted scenes, trailer and commentaries.",1064102400,2,1793,4.861386138613861

But the answer is yes, buy and watch this movie over and over again! Kennedy's portrayal of his character, B-rad, is nothing less than perfect. B-rad will make you laugh, make you feel sorry for him, but in the end, he'll make you see that people will love you for who you are. A great family movie,not too much violence, at all, and what little violence there is, has a comedic edge to it.  B-rad's ""DON'T BE HATIN"" logo sticks in your head for a long time after you've watched the movie, and if anything this movie helps to promote less gang violence and activity by shedding a different light on racial matters. This movie is just the beginning for a truly talented Jamie Kennedy, who displays that he is not just an actor and comedian, but an awesome writer.

1905623,4,B0000AGQ6R,"Brad Gluckman (Jamie Kennedy) is a wannabe gangsta (his nickname is `B-Rad`) from the notorious hood of Malibu, CA. B-Rad's father, Bill (Ryan O'Neal) is running for governor, and doesn't want his son to appear with him on the front pages of the papers. Bill's staff hatches a plan to get two classically trained African-American actors (Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson) to pose as gangstas to try and scare the hood out of B-Rad. Trouble is, B-Rad doesn't understand that the situation is a sham, and attempts to prove his street cred as they make their way through Los Angeles's more notorious suburbs.
The marketing won't say it, but `Malibu's Most Wanted' comes from a character Kennedy plays on his poorly rated, but uproarious hidden camera show on the WB, `The Jamie Kennedy Experiment' (or `JKX' for short). I think there are about 10 of us out there who've seen Kennedy run through this B-Rad shtick before, and it was always a highlight on the show. However, `Malibu' puts B-Rad out there front and center for 90 minutes of silver screen time, threatening to take this funny character miles away from entertaining. Thankfully, `Malibu' complements the character more than tires him out. The film isn't exactly on the pulse of today's satire (Sacha Baron Cohen, with his flat-out brilliant white boy gangsta character `Ali G,' has beaten B-Rad to the punch by a couple of years), but Kennedy and his screenwriters (including hysterical stand-up comedian Nick Swardson, who also appears in the film as one of B-Rad's posse) still find ways to send up the current street-hop nation, all the while keeping the proceedings delightfully silly and buoyant.
The production gets a lot of mileage out of B-Rad's gangsta style, even going so far as to try and implement a new catchphrase with `Don't Be Hatin'.' B-Rad's adventures also take him to a Korean grocery store, a rap battle straight from the set of `8 Mile,' and a run in with a rat that sound surprisingly like Snoop Dogg. The material has fun with the intermixing cultures theme, and never degenerates into distinctly hateful stereotypes like `Bringing Down The House' did. Though it won't win any NAACP awards, `Malibu' is a nice forward thrust toward the played-out gangsta/mall-kid culture that too many suburban kids subscribe to.
Since he's lived with the character for a couple of years now, Jamie Kennedy has the B-Rad moves down in every detail. This is a terribly funny performance, with Kennedy playing up B-Rad's blissful ignorance of how his privileged upbringing directly interferes with his urban dreams. It goes beyond simple caricature, with Kennedy avoiding making B-Rad into the butt of every joke. Counter Kennedy's performance with that of Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson. As the two `wanksters,' the actors couldn't be more out of their realm. They try far too hard to make their material funny, and they lay on the `we are classically trained!' horn a little too long. Every time the film features these two actors, you can see it trying to be a comedy. But with Jamie Kennedy, the effort isn't nearly as noticeable.
You don't have to be a fan of `JKX' to fully enjoy `Malibu's Most Wanted.' This is appealing satire, and it hits almost all the right notes.",1058832000,2,3241,4.8945454545454545
1905624,4,B0000AGQ6R,"Although filled with every possible word that ends with ""izzel"", Malibu's Most Wanted has some funny stuff. Jamie Kennedy's delivery is rather funny and he understands how to play the character; he doesn't need to go out of his way to make his character look ridiculous, because his ridiculousness speaks for itself. There was a funny moment on the tv commercials about a hot dog and bun that was inexplicably was taken out; hopefully it will be somewhere on the dvd. I also hope the dvd also has the marvelous Coors television commercial (""You oughta see the ice in my cooler; you'd think I was a jewler!"").

1905625,4,B0000AGQ6R,"I was pleasantly surprised by ""Malibu's Most Wanted""! It actually turned out to be a very funny movie. I was a little skeptical at first, but I can't deny that there were moments where I was laughing very hard.
The story revolves around Brad (a.k.a. B-rad), a rich kid from Malibu, who has completely taken on the thug lifestyle. Although he's never really left Malibu and gone to the real ""streets"" of L.A., he still feels that he's from the hood. Brad seems to be hurting his father's campaign to become governor, so two actors are hired to scare Brad ""white"".  What happens to Brad, the actors, and an ambitious young lady will have you rolling!
Not only was Jamie Kennedy very good in his role as Brad, but I especially liked Taye Diggs' and Anthony Anderson's portrayals as actors trying to find their motivation for acting like thugs, which was very hard for the classically-trained characters.
Although the critics have been somewhat harsh while reviewing this movie, I would definitely suggest it. It's a cute movie that you can see when you want to have a good laugh. See for yourself!!![.]",1053561600,2,1099,4.723958333333333

1905629,1,B0000AGQ6R,"Jamie Kennedy's character, B-Rad G, is a wanna-be ""gangsta rapper"" from ""The `Bu"" who laments that his life is hard. After all, he has to contend with things like traffic and having too much money. His father is running for governor of California and B-Rad's behavior is ""embarrassing"" and costing him votes. Tom Gibbons is one of two black staff members and is also B-Rad's father's campaign manager. He and his staff devise a plan to kidnap B-Rad and have the ""black scared out of him.""
Enter Sean and P.J., a pair of feminine, black, classically trained actors, who are as unfamiliar with ""the hood"" as B-Rad is. They have to study a hip-hop dictionary to learn the correct phraseology to use on the streets and will be paid $30,000 to carry out the scheme. P.J.'s cousin, Shondra, who actually lives in the hood, enters into the scheme so she can make a quick buck and open a chain of beauty salons. Do the writers really think the only way black people can get ahead in life is by ill-gotten gains and duplicitous methods?
Being a black woman from Los Angeles I struggled with whether or not to see this movie. Since the basic premise of the movie deals with hip-hop, I thought it would glorify the elements of the genre we are bombarded with on BET and MTV such as the ""video girls,"" the bling-bling, etc...",1051056000,5,1313,4.544303797468355
1905630,3,B0000AGQ6R,"Jamie Kennedy has shed his identity as Brad Gluckman, son of wealthy Malibu residents Bill (Ryan O'Neal) and Bess Gluckman (Bo Derek) to become LA pseudo gansta-rapper B-Rad. When his father runs for governor of California, B-Rad's unscripted appearances at his campaign rallies (supposedly to help his father appeal to the less priviledged voters to whom B-Rad claims that he relates) cause great embarrassment to his parents and consternation among the members of Bill's campaign staff. Blair Underwood, Bill's chief aide, then hires two black actors who appeared in a campaign commercial to ""scare B-Rad white"" by kidnapping him and holding him hostage while posing as gangstas from south central LA. They accomplish this by enlisting the help of the beautiful Shondra (Regina Hall). While there are some clever rap parodies and occasionally funny dialog in the first half of the movie, it drags a little while setting the scene for the hilarious second half.
The kidnappers, Sean (Taye Diggs) and P.J. (Anthony Anderson), are clueless about the gangsta culture they supposedly represent and thus have to prepare for the assignment by rehearsing their lines just like any other acting job. Then, things get complicated when B-Rad catches on to the scheme but doesn't realize that the script has changed and that he is in actual danger when Shondra's jealous ex-boyfriend Tec (Damien Dante Wayans) attempts to kidnap him. Snoop Dog even gets into the act as a gangsta rap version of Stuart Little.
Some of the rap parodies are very funny, even to viewers such as myself whose musical taste doesn't include hip hop. And the satire is at times right on, such as B-Rad rapping about ""Living in the Bu"", the varied members of his group, and the unsuccessful efforts of Sean and P.J. to mimic the attitudes of boys from the 'hood. In the words of one reviewer, some of the scenes are downright looney and incredibly funny.
Quite surprisingly  (undoubtedly to earn a PG-13 rating), the profanity is very limited and innocuous and there are only a couple of incidents involving sexual innuendo. The movie is the more enjoyable as a result because to keep the viewer's interest it has to rely on real humor and parody rather than shock value. There are a few very violent sequences in the latter half of the film, but they are completely stylized and involve substantial mayhem and destruction rather than sustained tension; there is no real gore and or death.
As the New York Times suggested, in some ways this is a subversive film by suggesting that B-Rad is no more phony than the black gangsta rappers who he mimics. I  enjoyed its feel good ending; although it was obviously a cop out the outcome was in keeping with the lighthearted nature of the story. So, if you want to see a combination romantic comedy, musical, and political satire, you will probably enjoy this film. However, to feel that it deserves more than three stars you probably have to be younger than I am and also a hip hop fan.
As a final aside, it was very interesting to have a movie starring older white actors (O'Neal and the very well preserved Bo Derek) in stereotypical roles, a white Kennedy playing against racial type, while the black actors Underwood, Diggs, Anderson, Wayans and Hall variously played with and against stereotypical roles implicit in the story. This was very effective and hopefully will help attract a racially diverse audience and cause  people to think about the movie's message as they laugh at the antics on the screen.",1050710400,10,3520,4.882943143812709
