8379420,5,B002SKIKSY,"Being a resisdent of Lake Forest for more than 10 years, I was curious to see what this movie had to offer.  I was pleasantly surpised of how entertaining the film was.  Typically, documentaries are not my first choice when it comes to watching movies.  The history of Lake Foreset had me completley intrigued and wanting for more.  The film captured yearly celbrations, beautiful scenery and interviews with residents that have made an positive impact for the town and our country.  This film should be a required viewing for all grade school children in the area, so they get another great opportunity to learn the history of Lake Forest.  This film is great for all audiences.",1255392000,2,679,4.810344827586207
8379421,5,B002SKIKSY,"Having spent the early years of my life in the Far North suburbs of Chicago, I was amazed at the history and beauty of Lake Forest that was portrayed by this movie. The documentary was enlightening and entertaining. The cinematography is truly amazing and keeps you wanting more. And there is no one better to narrate a documentary than Bill Kurtis. A must see for the family and especially anyone who is from the North Suburbs of Chicago.",1255392000,3,439,4.641025641025641
