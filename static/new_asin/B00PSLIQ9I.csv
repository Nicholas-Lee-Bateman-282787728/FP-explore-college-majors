6821164,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"I don't have the blu-ray yet so I can't re-view anything about it except the movie itself, which I saw at a screening last summer.

As an ardent fan of James Rolfe and the Nerd character I was thrilled when he announced he was working on a movie, though I was afraid of getting my hopes up because I truly didn't know what to expect: Would the Nerd be able to carry a feature-length film? Would two hours of Nerd jokes be overkill, or alternatively would James stray too far from what became a perfect formula for the Nerd episodes and produce something entirely unfamiliar and hollow?

After what seemed like an eternity of anticipation my best friend and I took a road trip to see the premiere Chicago screening and all I can say is that when the credits rolled at the end I was left with one thought above all else: James (bleeping) NAILED IT!

The film has a b-movie feel to it, so if you are looking for a big-budget Hollywood production look elsewhere. The effects are physical and optical - no CG here! The casting and acting were spot-on; my favorite performance was that of Stephen Mendel in his role as a demented general - HILARIOUS. The writing was perfect and while the story was fantastic (as in, ""un-realistic"" or ""incredible"") - just like many of the Nerd episodes! - who cares? That's the point of the thing! It was engrossing and truly pulled you in and made you care about the characters. No (bleep).

What else is there to say? If you know and love the Nerd you will love this. If you don't know the Nerd you need to find him like Jesus.",1418601600,22,1557,4.377162629757786
6821165,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"The nerd on blu-ray. What more can you ask for. If your a fan of James this is a must have for every collection. Spent twice the price to see it in theatres now we all get to enjoy it I'm our own homes.

6821166,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"Thirty bucks for a Blu Ray loaded with possibly over fourteen hours of footage in a new product, is a really good price. The special features of the behind the Scenes are perfect to watch if you are an inspiring film maker or someone who is just curious. Then you have the features, telling of one man's journey to get a film like this off the ground and going is a story worth listening to.

I remember, I was in Afghanistan when James pitch to us on Indiegogo trying to get funding. Hell I sent him 200 bucks out of my pay just so he can get him film off the ground. And now that this film is completely finished, it is worth every cent.  Money well spent.",1418515200,84,658,4.1328125
6821167,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"Man, it feels like just yesterday when this movie was first announced.

Well, I have to tell you right up front that I have been an AVGN fan ever since 2008 but admittedly, I was very skeptical. I'm by no means a ""fanboy"" and admit that the quality in videos have been a bit inconsistent in the past few years. However with that said, I am happy to say that if you are in fact a fan of the AVGN, it seems unlikely that you wouldn't find something to like here.

There are a lot of laugh out loud moments, many of which caught me off guard. It has a great sense of adventure and mystery, even if you already know the outcome of the ET landfill true story. There's a lot of really goofy and crazy moments, some of which are so absurd you can't help but laugh, specifically the big showdown at the end. There are also A LOT of cameos and throwbacks to the AVGN universe (?) References to previous episodes, characters from other online video game series, basically a big in-joke that works. It never felt like he just threw in these cameos repeatedly. There are a lot of them but they're spread out enough throughout the movie that when a certain someone shows up, it's actually funny and not just ""oh, he just stuck him there like he did 5 minutes ago.""

For an independent film like this, it actually looks very good. I mean it's not a Hollywood production but the way its shot is a notch up the average indie film. The effects are laughable, in the nicest way possible. Obvious miniatures and low angles are there and they're so obvious, you can't help but laugh out loud. They're great. The fun that the crew were having making the film comes through to the audience. It's been a while since I've seen a new film and thought to myself during it ""wow, I'm actually having a fun time watching this.""

I did have a few problems with the movie. The biggest that comes to mind is the runtime. The movie is almost 2 hours and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little bored in the middle. There's a lot of fat that can be cut out here and by shortening it to an hour twenty to an hour and a half would have been a very big improvement. Also, some of the editing is a little awkward at times. Some scenes will end with a joke or someone just walking away and the way it transitioned into the next scene had me scratching my head a few times. Also, while there were a loud of laugh out loud moments, there are a lot of jokes that fall flat. I saw this in theaters and the audience went from a big belly laugh to an awkward chuckle from a few people.

I'd be interested to read or hear a review from someone who has no knowledge of the AVGN and are watching this as just an independent comedy. I can only speak for myself. I watched this movie part as a fan, part as a movie goer. I wasn't going to give it a pass because I was already a fan and was just ready to love it. I can admit when AVGN has a bad episode and there are quite a few I don't re-watch. I have some big problems with the movie and admittedly, not everything that was intended works. But with that said, this is a movie made for the fans funded by the fans. It's a lot of fun to watch and if you just wanna watch a real silly and off the wall movie, check it out. It was worth the wait.",1418515200,39,3246,4.09748427672956

6821170,3,B00PSLIQ9I,"Whether hardcore or casual, most gamers who are also film fans have seen such big budget pictures as Pixels and Wreck-It-Ralph. However, theres a thriving indy video game movie scene as well, exemplified by such fun but relatively obscure features as Nintendo Quest and King of the Arcades. A standout in this category is Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (starring YouTube sensation James Rolfe), which is noteworthy not for its quality but for its lack thereof. Adult in the most juvenile sense of the word (Rolfe is famous for his expletive-laden tirades), the movie is so bad its good.

This movie is a departure from the episodes though since it follows an adventure instead of him just reviewing a game.

That doesn't mean that the casual movie viewer looking for a decent bit of comedy can't get into it, but watching some AVGN episodes in order to get a feel for the humor style doesn't hurt much. As far as the budget goes, it's about the same as a current Sci-fi channel movie, so don't go in expecting a multi-million dollar masterpiece. Also, as a long time AVGN fan, I wish a big fight between the main giant monster and Super Mecha Death Christ would have been awesome!",1502841600,,557,4.314285714285714

No.  That's why it lives up to the low expectations you will have.  Reasonable acting and a convoluted but very funny story line, I heartily recommend this for a number of belly laughs and the dozen or so shout outs to classic movies like King Kong, Godzilla and others along with a fine japing of those who find video games a waste of time and those who love them.

If you've watched and enjoyed the famous videos, you'll find a lot to like about the AVGN Movie, which if nothing else is a silly romp whose worst offense is being about 30 minutes too long.  Everything about this movie is stupid, but I mean that in the most endearing way possible -- The AVGN Movie never takes itself seriously, and shamelessly flaunts its many flaws with gusto.  It's clear a lot of love and intense effort was put into this modern-day B-movie, which was made for an astoundingly low $325,000, with director / lead actor / writer James Rolfe (The Nerd) doing nearly all the editing himself.  This is a movie for fans and no one else, and viewed outside that context it's just weird and confusing.  Watch for a number of surprise cameos featuring YouTube personalities and a couple of real celebrities, particularly the show-stealing brief performance by Eddie Pepitone.",1499817600,2,1060,4.67741935483871

But movies like this are meant for a niche group. A group called nerds. The rest of you aren't going to get the humor, you're not going enjoy our weird love of the very horrible special effects.  Basically, you're going to have a very bad time if you watch this.
 But... if you know what Nintendo is, Or Atari. If you've ever been so frustrated by a game you literally want to throw the game controller out the window, well.. You're going to find this hilarious.

6821202,2,B00PSLIQ9I,"I enjoy the AVGN web series enough to have watched every episode about three times, which is what brought me here. However, very little of what I like about the web series is in the movie, and instead it's just creator James Rolfe's love letter to B-movies. This might be okay for some people, but not for me.

This movie doesn't star any of the characters from the show other than the Nerd himself. You only get brief cameos of characters you might recognize. The Nerd doesn't even get a proper introduction to people who haven't seen the web series, nor is his character developed in any interesting way. The Nerd ought to begin the movie with a full game review to at least give non-fans a genuine dose of what the character is about. Surely some indie game developer would have been happy to let him use their game in the movie for that purpose. Instead, you just get very brief glimpses of the Nerd reviewing made-up games, and that's just not enough to explain to anyone who's new to the series why it's so funny and beloved. There is finally a review during the credit roll, but it's one of his least humorous.

The web series, despite being a comedy show with occasional fantasy elements, usually still informs the viewer about games and game history, and a lot of the humor stems from the fact that the Nerd character knows what he's talking about. In the movie, very little is factual, even about the E.T. game. The premise of the movie revolves around the fact that the game was buried in the desert, but even that history is altered for the plot of the movie.

I would have much preferred a mockumentary like Spinal Tap to a B-movie with corny monsters and explosions and poorly-written dialogue.

There is some praise to be given, though. The soundtrack is excellent. They clearly worked hard on the project and did a lot with a small budget. It's just that I'd much rather watch just about any episode of the web series than the movie.",1491091200,10,1949,4.5127478753541075

This movie was pretty boring, and felt like it was dragging in places.  I had to stop watching at parts because I was falling asleep.  Considering all of the interesting ideas that the movie had, you'd think it would have been more engaging and interesting than it turned out to be.  The one thing I can commend is that the acting was well-done, and James stayed surprisingly in-character throughout the film.  Otherwise spoken, it was a dull, overly long snoozer.  I wouldn't recommend it.",1478131200,2,662,4.663793103448276

6821240,2,B00PSLIQ9I,"As much as I love the AVGN series and pretty much all the other things that James Rolfe does on his Cinemassacre site, I was disappointed in the AVGN movie.  Granted, I expected next to nothing, but I got little more than that.

The humor was generally OK, and I get the fact that it does not take itself seriously at all, but the cheesiness of the plot and writing goes completely overboard in some places.  Worst yet, the pacing just drags.  There were plenty of scenes that should have been trimmed or completely removed since they served no purpose whatsoever.  This would have worked better as maybe a short, or at the very least something far less than almost the 2 hrs running time.  His normal AVGN web episodes are far superior because they are short and to the point, with just enough of everything to get the humor across and sort of tell a story.  In that regard, the AVGN movie suffers from the Saturday Night Live ""syndrome"" where short sketch comedies rarely translate well to full-on feature length cinema, with the original Blues Brothers being the rare exception.

If his goal was to make an Ed Wood style ""so bad it's good"" type of film, then he completely succeeded. I give James an A for effort, and think he is a really smart and talented man, but in the end it just didn't really make me laugh.",1475625600,,1317,4.458333333333333

6821259,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"I can kind of see where the hate/disappointment comes from, but I guess that's the pattern with crowd-funded movies/games: They get so hyped to the point where people get excited beyond reason. After two years of it's release, I FINALLY got around to seeing it and I LOVED IT. I think the thing is people wanted it to be more of a nod to video games, but it ended up being more of a nod to films. It's one of those films that's really not meant to be taken seriously (especially since the opening includes the Nerd throwing a game into a trash can and the trash can explodes.)

I loved the film, and it does have a few moments with bad green-screen (mainly Cooper's introduction) but the rest of the green screen is REALLY well-done, and all of the moments that look bad were MEANT to look bad. It's a self-aware comedy, but not the kind of self-aware that  the Scary Movies pull and looks at the audience, winks and says ""Yes, this is stupid."" AVGN The movie just lets the craziness happen, and I LOVE that about it. It's meant to be a fun comedy that never takes itself overly serious, and it's immersive in it's plot and story-telling.

The effects are also pretty good for a rather small budget. Yeah, there are moments where it's obvious it's a miniature or a guy in a suit or a dummy being thrown, but that just adds to the comedic charm, and speaking of comedy, the film does a good job of THAT, too. There were moments where I almost threw up from laughing so hard. There's even a moment in the audience reaction track (yes, I actually watch those. Shut up) where people were laughing so hard you couldn't even hear the next of dialogue in the film.

In the end, I may have loved it, but it could just be another one those films that's truly appreciated by fans and film-makers, but I'll be up on the cinematic barricade of indie films with a musket defending this film like Jean Valjean. (Yes, that was a botched reference.)

Besides, it's better than pretty much every YouTuber movie made by YouTube Red.",1468540800,,2014,4.403225806451613

The musical scores were amazing expecially for an indi film and it really did make the movie my advice to you if you like avgn and your not one to complain if its not citizen Kane then get this and help support a great man.

This part is to the people who obviously either don't watch the movie or have no respect for film making. Its hard to make a movie its not easy at al

I did enjoy some of the effects, they were cheap, but they looked good for being cheap. That being said, a lot of the miniatures are pretty bad. James has done FAR better on a lot of the episodes of AVGN. I personally think the Nerd is the best part of the film (as he should be). I was expecting this film to be ""so bad it's good"" but looking at everything, it was just alright. I will say that as a film maker myself, I do respect James for going out and making a film he wanted to.",1452384000,3,606,3.8951612903225805
6821329,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"I technically own this movie times three! I bought it when it was first available as a digital download. Then I bought it on DVD. Now I have it on Amazon Prime! 3 copies! I also have the film poster, signed by James Rolfe.

Not only do I like The Nerd, but I like James Rolfe even more. It warms my heart that his fans and hard work made his dream of making a feature film come true. But on top of that, It's a good movie!
The transition from short internet videos to a feature has been well made, with new characters and settings that make it worth the effort. The film is weird and goofy with impressively quaint special effects. I wouldn't have done it any other way. The performances are nuts. The story is nuts. I'm nuts for it.

I do have some problems with it, however. I understand that the story and characters had to be expanded for a film, but it's odd how little of that continuity carries over to the series. But I guess it doesn't have to. Also, I wanted to see more Mike and Bootsy! Not just cameos! I love those guys.",1452384000,3,1033,4.16
6821330,5,B00PSLIQ9I,It's a funny movie. I enjoyed it. Watched it for free on Prime...what else is there to say. If you are looking for a drama about video games you should check out another movie.,1452297600,,176,4.205882352941177

6821332,2,B00PSLIQ9I,"Besides featuring the AVGN character, the movie is nothing like what you would expect an AVGN movie to be.  The AVGN character typically reviews bad video games, but this movie makes him out to be some kind of adventure movie star, and is completely out of place here.  He is paired with two sidekicks who we barely get time to know.  One sidekick, you would swear that he and the AVGN go way back, but he was never featured in the AVGN series before or after this movie.  The story is very confusing and hard to follow.  Towards the end of the film, there are multiple, barely-related subplots occurring at the same time.

Worst of all, it is just a very boring movie.  You don't find yourself cheering anyone on because, aside from the poor story, you just don't have any kind of connection with the characters.  The movie just doesn't give you a reason to be excited.

What prevents this movie from getting one star are the effects. Something James Rolfe does well is the B-movie-type special effects using models, people in costumes, and pyrotechnics.  It is a good use of ""so bad, it's good,"" and is a great throwback to mid-century sci-fi films.

Overall, it's very hard to recommend this movie.  It might be worth checking out if you're a fan of the AVGN, but don't expect the same kind of laughs that you would get from a standard episode of AVGN.",1452038400,3,1355,4.508196721311475
6821333,3,B00PSLIQ9I,"Back when the original 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' movie came out in 1990, Roger Ebert gave it a positive review because he felt it was the best possible movie that could've been made based on the source material. I feel that this movie IS NOT the best possible movie that could've been mad out of the AVGN character. The plot is incoherent, the characters are annoying, and its way too long.

However, it is still charming as a monument to self-expression. You can tell that a lot of hard work went into the movie, the special effects in particular, and that it was a total labor of love. I only wish they would have spent as much time polishing up the script as they did working on the SFX. A fresh set of eyes during the editing process probably wouldn't have been such a bad idea.",1452038400,6,787,4.390410958904109

6821335,2,B00PSLIQ9I,"I appreciate the time and effort that went into this film.  James Rolfe and all of his counterparts obviously worked hard.  Unfortunately, the script is a big, unfocused mess.  Lots of new characters that we barely get to know.  The humor falls flat.  The villains are played as buffoons so there's never any tension or a sense of real danger.  So much of what happens in the film feels unnecessary.  Personally, I'd have rather gotten a handful of AVGN episodes over this movie.",1451865600,3,479,4.698795180722891

I got the jokes, got the references, and you can tell James and his crew put their heart and soul into this puppy. How can you tell? The insane amount of bonus features jam packed into this thing. I think only Kevin Smith's releases are more comprehensive. And they're candid, too. Rolfe isn't afraid to be self-deprecating, and even lets Doug Walker's Nostalgia Critic ream the movie a good one. Shows a lot of maturity in a filmmaker to be able to know what kind of movie they've made and be perfectly okay with it.

6821347,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"I enjoyed this movie. I was disappointed that the DVD release didn't have as many special features as the Blu-ray one but I'm used to that from other movie releases. I would have liked to have a copy of the Nostalgia Critic review on my DVD, I've only seen it on ChannelAwesome.com and I'm a big fan of both AVGN and the Nostalgia Critic. I do recommend finding the Nostalgia Critic anniversary films for ThatGuyWithTheGlasses.com, you should be able to watch them on YouTube and Channel Awesome if you can't get them on DVD. James has a cameo in each one, though it's only his voice in the second one. The titles are Kickassia, Suburban Knights and To Boldly Flee. Anyways, back to this movie, the Nerd has a sidekick/manager which is kind of funny but I don't really like him that much. I don't mind that they added a new character but I think I would have rather seen Mike in the movie more instead of just a short cameo. Now the General, I don't know why, but just about every time he's on screen he makes me laugh. I don't know if it's the way he's always yelling or getting hurt but. I just found him really funny. The monster with the satellite dish on his head (sorry I don't know how to spell it's name and I'm pretty sure they say it a different way each time in the movie) was pretty ridiculous even for the Nerd. Especially the part with the bologna sandwich. I did like the alien that they made for the movie. I'm not really sure why, I guess I just thought it was funny looking. I didn't really like the way the female lead ended up with the sidekick at the end instead of the Nerd but then I guess the Nerd really couldn't have a girlfriend because they would have to try and write it into his future videos. I'm running out of things to say but I do recommend seeing this movie. If you can't buy a physical copy then try and get a digital one.

6821356,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"Well, to be honest, I don't love the movie. I think that James is a very talented man who made over 200 movies and started very early as a young kid. I really love all his personas, the AVGN, the bull**it man, Board James etc. In addition to that I like his videos with Mike, Kyle and all his other friends. (From video game review to movie review!)

There are also some ""documentaries"" about James himself and I learned, that he really cares about those old school movies he grew up with. Therefore he chose to add some special effects in the movie, that a lot of people would describe as ""cheesy"" or ""lame"". But in fact, that is the way he prefers it.

In my opinion the movie is quite long, about two hours, and there is a lot going on. I didn't have very high expectations of that movie, because I knew, that he only had a tiny amount of money to make the movie and it is pretty much work to get it done. If you're interested in the making of, there are videos on the official cinemassacre channel on youtube!

I can't review the movie just by itself, because I think there is more to it. A lot of people worked their A**** off to produce the movie and I like to support James and his friends, because I like the way he does his videos, for example his humor and all the friends he includes there.

I agree with other people on that point, that the side kicks in the movie seem to be random. I would have prefered a movie just about the nerd himself too. Maybe James wanted to merge all his visions and dreams about making a very ""big"" movie into this one, because he always wanted to be a movie director and now he had a great oppurtunity.

If you are a fan of James' work in gerneral, go ahead and watch the movie. It is pretty OK and has some good jokes, but it is not a super hyped blockbuster. Be aware, that this is some kind of a B-movie and if you don't like this genre at all, you'll maybe be disappointed.

I chose a 5 star review because I think James is a very good movie creator and I want to appreciate his efforts in general. The movie itself is an OK movie.",1444003200,,2077,4.116049382716049

6821358,1,B00PSLIQ9I,"I have seen almost every episode of AVGN.  I really like the webisodes.  I even like ""Board James"" and the other series at Cinemassacre even though I think James' friend Mike is creepy and should not be on camera (ever).  James Rolfe really has something -- even though the early films (pre-AVGN) are kind of unwatchable IMO.

All that said, this movie was terrible.  TERRIBLE.  I could not watch more than about 30 minutes of it (the part where they find the game developer's house) before very disappointedly turning it off.  WOW.  As in, the ""I want my money back"" kind of terrible.

They omitted almost everything that made the web series funny and appealing.  Instead, we started out by hearing for twenty minutes about how famous the nerd is.  PLEASE.  The only people watching this movie are people who know the series, so there's no need to introduce him.  James, I seriously love most of your work, but AVGN is not going major league via this movie.  Instead, all of these monuments to the nerd's Internet fame came off as really conceited and very alienating.

My guess about why this movie came out so bad was that, rather than experimenting with what worked in a movie-length format and going from there, James came up with an idea, hired a bunch of C-list actors (WHY SPEND BUDGET DOLLARS ON THIS, SERIOUSLY WHY), started filming from a top-down position, and found out it didn't work, but was already trapped in a corner and had to follow through due to contractual and other obligations.  It really didn't work, but almost all of the webisodes do.  Why is that?

I think the real reason was that James aimed way too high on this one.  Instead of keeping the movie's tone similar to that of the web series, only more expansive, he shifted gears completely, overshot by a mile, and tried to throw in the kitchen sink.  A swing and a miss -- and then the batter spun around and fell down in a big pile of dog crap to boot.  What was he thinking?

Still, I loved ""Seaman,"" so it's not like he's lost the talent.  This was just a poorly conceived effort IMO.  Try one where AVGN is just walking around his neighborhood and home town.  Start smaller.",1443830400,14,2159,4.5310880829015545

6821366,2,B00PSLIQ9I,"The Good- The plot of the movie (as ridiculous as it is) is actually interesting and somewhat intricate. Some of the modest effects work well and even when they don't it's funny anyway. There are a few genuine laugh-out-loud moments here.

The Bad- This movie is at least 20-30 minutes too long. Story arcs languish horribly instead of moving from point A to point B. The quizzical move to insert some generic sidekick instead of longtime friend Mike Matei is beyond me. The chemistry would have been far better had they gone that route. The jokes come at you like a tired pitcher's fastballs, no zip on them whatsoever. It's basically patch work AVGN phrases slapped together in a different order. The script could have used some tightening up and the dialogue could have used a lot of work. There are some interesting set-ups that could have been funny but they let those opportunities go by the wayside. Also, he doesn't really seem all that angry here, it's more like the grouchy video game nerd.

The Deal- If you are sick in bed with the flu, then this wouldn't be the worst way to spend your time. It's ironic that he dedicates the movie to his fans and gives them a diluted version of the character. It is impressive that he got the movie made at all. And you can see James's influences throughout the film. The passion is there. However, the ability to pace a movie is not (somewhat surprising). It's not an awful movie, but much like a senior citizen with a walker, it takes awhile to get where it's going and when it does it's not sure what to do. Or, in the spirit of AVGN, it's like being constipated on the bowl for a half-hour and when you finally crap it comes out slower than words out of a post-retired Muhammed Ali's mouth. I think the AVGN well has been tapped.",1441929600,3,1781,4.476923076923077

If you are looking for an AVGN movie, this has the character, but not much else from the show at all. I think the movie would have been better if it had actually more to do with the show. Now I'm not saying I want an hour and 50 minute episode, but at least some of the characters could have appeared (like Super Mecha Death Christ, or the Glitch Germlin). Also the plot was all over the place, and very inconsistent. For a first movie by the director, it was pretty good, but it did not meet my expectations at all.",1438819200,6,600,4.093220338983051

I love the AVGN, me and my brother watched all of his episodes countless of times, and this movie is a huge insult to the series:

(SPOILERS MIGHT BE AHEAD...if you want to watch this piece of s***)

-No characters from the AVGN series like Kyle, Mike, Glitch Remlin, Rob, Bugs Bunny and so on..., instead random weird stranger character who are lame and were never seen in the AVGN episodes.
-The plot is ridiculous and makes no sense. The E.T. review at the end of the movie sucks also, it's unlike a Nerd episode, which it should have been in my oppinion to begin with. He goes way to easy on this dreaded, so overly anticipated ""worst game of all time""
-The special effects are just plain BAD. I know this is a very low budget, independend movie but some of those effects are just an insult to humanity. They are an insult to James as a film maker. I know he can do better!
-The movie is boring most of the time and the jokes are not funny. If you expect the movie to be as funny as the AVGN episodes with the same kind of humor and action, you will get dissapointed. It's just a weird mix of strange characters and boring scenes, and it goes on for way too long.
-Some known characters like the NC, Mike, Kyle only make a 1 second appearence at the end of the movie, while they should have been there the whole movie!

I don't know man....like what were they thinking? How could they do this to the AVGN franchise? They take the role of LJN, except LJN ruined a lot of video games, and James ruined his own movie. But something tells me that it is not James fault. I believe he knows better, and he can do better.
James has such a broad knowledge and expertiece when it comes to movies and staying loyal to fans. Just watch his movie reviews, look at his AVGN episodes and look at board james. You can tell James made those with passion, but the movie...not. It feels odd, as if he didn't do it, but someone else. Maybe someone got him by the balls, who knows but I don't believe James is happy with his own movie either.

No matter if you have high expectations or low expectations (or no at all), no matter if you expect it to be faithful to the AVGN series or not...
YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED. This movie is just a huge fail, it sucks so hard it doesn't even matter if you are a huge fan of AVGN like me or you are completely new to him.",1437091200,16,2531,4.1676891615541924

This film is a poor representation of what makes the AVGN web series great. The script is bizarrely unrelated to the web series and the film is bloated and slow. Most jokes and set pieces fall flat due to the sloth like pacing of the film. A full half hour or more could be cut from the film and it would play much, much better.

I liked it thought it couldve been better but I'm not an actor or a producer of anything but music so I got to give him props because its a film he would make. Its his style. Id love to see him do a movie with mike, bootsy and the gang about they're backgrounds and how they became friends and how he got to doing the games. Or a movie about how bad dr.jakyl and mr.hyde is since that seems to be his worst rated game over and over again. I think people need to keep in mind this guy also has a family and im sure he has an actual job. If you always trying to do what critics want you to do as an artist ect. you loose the passion for what your doing when your trying to please everyone. I liked it James good job.

6821388,3,B00PSLIQ9I,"It's bittersweet to finally see this movie. I dearly want to rate it higher but 3 stars seems about fair. James loves his craft and you can tell he really, honestly tried to deliver the best movie he could for his fans, perhaps to the detriment of the movie itself. The references to his show are many and oftentimes feel forced. From a fan's perspective, who knows all these quotes by heart, this was not necessary and feels off somehow. His fans will know all this stuff by heart and there is no need for it. The strong point is the story, which I won't spoil but is very clever. The acting is uneven ranging from bad to decent. Where this disc shines is in the extra content. James has always shared his love of movies with his fans and this disc is no exception. It's bursting with extras giving you a peek into what it must have been like to take on a task like this for the first time. This one is for the fans and as fan myself, I can't find it my heart to hate on this movie even though it is far from great. It does have it's moments though. This one's got heart and I do hope James gets to make more movies and hone his craft. I'll be there if he does. If you do not know who the Nerd is, this movie is likely to fall flat for you and I would not recommend it.

6821391,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie is an interesting blend of polished film-making and Cinemassacre's characteristic, shoestring style.

For fans of James Rolfe and people he's worked with, this movie will be filled with all sorts of satisfying references and cameos. For people who aren't familiar with the AVGN web series, there's a pretty good introduction to it in the beginning of the movie. However, the movie's plot is a bit messy at times and The Nerd feels a little out of place in the world of the movie, which are the reasons why I couldn't give it five stars. That being said, though, Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie is enjoyable overall and probably won't disappoint fans of old video games and nostalgic people who were born in the 1980s.

Here are my personal highlights:

- All the references and cameos.
- The intentionally crappy parts of the movie, which are so fitting for its Cinemassacre origins.
- Cooper, Mandi, General Dark Onward, McButter, Mr. Swann, and the Alien (voiced by Robbie Rist, who also voiced Michaelangelo in all three of the original live action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies).

If you follow him closely, subscribe to his youtube channel, and keep up to date with all his most recent videos I think you'll be pleased. It wasn't the best movie I've watched. There were plenty of flaws and bits that could have been better, but I was happy with the results. I thought it focused a bit too much on AVGN's celebrity, but then again the plot wouldn't have worked without it. I thoroughly enjoyed all the practical effects, but a couple things that bothered me were simple bad composites. Right off the bat you can tell AVGN's sidekick was green screened into AVGN's room. There were a couple instances like that, and it bugged me. I mean all the 3-D and 2-D effects were very polished, so why slack off for a couple of what-should-be simple composites?

What impressed me the most was watching the Special Features. That gave me a real idea of how much work went into this little film. There are PLENTY of extras on the Blu-ray to sift through. Overall, it's really something unique to AVGN fans and more specifically Cinemassacre fans alone. I admire that about James. He could have created a dumbed-down script to appeal to the masses, but he didn't. He stuck to his guns, and made the movie HE wanted to make.

It isn't a perfect film by any means, a few of the jokes missed the mark and dropped into the cheese just a bit too much for me, however not enough to give this a poor review. Some of the jokes had me laughing very hard and it's just one real long episode.

I saw a few complaints that there wasn't enough Nintendo in the movie, but you have to understand what a difficult process it is to get rights to that stuff, especially decades after they were released. I think anyone familiar with the AVGN will get the references in the re enactments just fine and theres kind of a nice charm to how he represents his character in a slightly different medium.

6821415,2,B00PSLIQ9I,"First up, yes, I was a fan since James first started as The Angry Nintendo Nerd... I really enjoyed his Youtube reviews of old games, however, after a while, they did begin to get a bit stale, and only now and then are any of his reviews as classic as they once where.

James announced sometime ago that he was making a movie out of the Nerd character. Sure, I too got excited... I knew it would be low budget, but James Youtube channel began to demolish my expectations of this film being any good... probably because he stopped working on the AVGN videos that made him a youtube sensation, and instead kept posting annoying James and Mike Monday videos. They aren't funny, they are boring, and I lost a lot of respect for James as he kept uploading those, I just can't get my head around how someone could care less what two guys playing a game think? I don't even care to watch friends play games without myself being involved, so just because it's the guy who plays AVGN I'm supposed to care or find that entertaining? I call it cheap filler and I don't get why so many die-hard fans of his would praise him for spending 20 minutes regurgitating into a microphone, slapping some effects on the video and passing it off as entertainment. It's along the lines of people who watch other people on youtube who are just sitting there playing a video game; you can't see the game itself, you just watch them play it. Why that appeals to some people I don't think I will ever know?

Anyway, enough pointless gibber, onto the movie...

The first good thing about the movie is that Mike is not a character in it. He does appear in a brief cameo, but thankfully he has no role in the movie. But low and behold, that's about the only good thing I can say about the film!

I too can enjoy low budget films, so I don't give the film a low score because it's cheaply made and doesn't contain Michael Bay style explosions etc...etc.... Some parts of the movie I could see where almost humerus, I could see what James was going for, but like 99% of the jokes in this film, they just did not work.

So the story of the film is every AVGN fan has asked when he will review the ancient Atari game E.T? What is agreed is one of the worst games ever created. Now James finally has to do it when he is approached by someone with a dumb name that wants him to take a trip to New Mexico and uncover the buried E.T games to see if it's a myth or not that Atari had every copy they could get back buried beneath the desert? He goes along with his female lead, and an annoying side kick that has come out of nowhere, but is basically trying too hard to replicate Kevin Hart's character from Scary Movie 3 and 4. It just came across as annoying and not funny.

The military get involved when they think James and his friends are trying to uncover an extra terrestrial, while looking for E.T games to review. They end up on the run from the military and find themselves in a predictable and boring plot with very little humor to it.

Sure the movie stays true to AVGN, as a few references to old reviews and things pop up, but even the attempt at new ways to cuss out a game just fail in this movie. It honestly felt stale to me, not nearly as funny as earlier reviews by James this title is derived from, and it painfully tried too hard stay nostalgic while forgetting to keep it funny.

There is just too much mixed humor, which doesn't work well I don't think. It reminds me of reading a 3rd graders creative writing story. It was at parts Looney Tunes style humor, in particular Road Runner and Coyote, but then you get blood and gore for no reason at all?

Honestly, I was expecting something along the lines of a Troma film, but even this film failed to even hit that expectation. The only decent idea was the story behind the E.T game and why it's so bad, revealing a fictional history to the game that tells an interesting story, and will probably stay in many peoples minds forever as to why the game is so bad... but that doesn't excuse the rest of the film and it's lack of humor and plot for what is labeled as supposedly being a comedy.

James should really just stick to doing what he does best... which is something that is not nearly as popular as it once was, and growing pretty thin. If this is the result of what he can do with this kind of budget of filming, I don't hold much hope for his future movie making career. I just wish some of those die-hard fans would step back and really look at this guy through honesty, and not just praise his name and rate everything he does as some sort of brilliant mind creating ingenious little films for generations to come. Lets face it, he's posted up more filler video in the last 3 years than the videos that made him what he is today in the first place. People can hang onto someone bringing back memories and saying things out loud we all thought when playing those games ourselves, but unfortunately, the 15 mins of fame has passed and it's only a matter of time before people wake up and realize his best days are behind him, the proof is this movie here, being the very best that this man can achieve!",1432080000,2,5144,4.277492291880781

6821417,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"First and foremost, ignore all of the incredibly nitpicky negative reviews of this film.  Is it perfect?  Absolutely not, but what art doesn't have it's flaws?  If you go in with the right mindset, this film is terrific.  I think the flack that this movie has received is simply a lack of understanding.  If you get the humor of movies like ""Spaceballs"" you'll understand, but I would say It's style is more derivative of a film you might see from Troma (and yes this movie even has a cameo by Troma's own Lloyd Kaufman).  A big part of the humor in this movie is the fact that intentionally tries to be bad at times (i.e. campy jokes and practical special fx that are intentionally non realistic).  If you're expecting a drawn out episode of AVGN then you're going to be disappointed.  This is Rolfe's way of fulfilling the dream of making a feature length film and creating it as a love letter to his fans in the process (the film even has appearances from a number of his fans).  But this doesn't mean that the things that make the Nerd character aren't present because they are, you simply get to know him on a more personal level. In summation, this film is funny, creative, imaginative, and ambitious.  It's a small scale project with a limited budget and for what it is... it's incredibly entertaining.  The DVD is nice, the Blu Ray is packed full of informative extras, if you don't want to spend the money on either of those I would suggest at least finding the digital download to give this movie a shot!  Bravo!",1431734400,,1522,4.494545454545454
6821418,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"I've been a fan of the Nerd and Cinemassacre in general since 2006, when he first started gaining popularity on YouTube. His sense of humor is very much on the same wavelength as mine, and I've pretty much enjoyed everything he's ever produced with only a tiny handful of exceptions. This film, however, is absolutely NOT an exception. When it was first announced, I really had no idea what to expect, but I supported it 100% because I believe in James Rolfe and even look up to him in some ways. I was glad to be a part of making his lifelong dream come true.

I was lucky enough to see one of the handful of screenings for it in the summer of 2014, in Atlanta. That day I drove 500 miles round-trip, just to see this film. And I would do it again tomorrow if I could. It was the first time I'd ever been in a room filled with fellow AVGN fans. The movie was non-stop laughs the entire way through. It was one of the best experiences I've ever had in a theater, and I'll never forget that day.

I bought the Blu-Ray as soon as it came out, and was excited to see it again (I could have paid to stream it, but chose to wait for the physical release). I was a little worried that it wouldn't be as good watching it at home without the benefit of a theater full of fellow fans. Luckily, my fears were dashed, and I found the film just as fun the second time. There were even quite a few lines I had missed in the theater, because they'd been drowned out by lingering laughter from a previous joke. I was surprised how plentiful the special features were. It took HOURS to get through them all. The director's commentary was also very insightful and entertaining, and I learned a lot of interesting tidbits about the production. I could go on about the special features, but to sum it up, they are fun, informative, and entertaining.

As for the film itself? It is a wild and crazy rollercoaster, and a melting pot of many film genres. Yes, the special effects are intentionally, and hilariously, bad and cheap-looking (with a couple of surprising exceptions). Yes, the script is very much in the style of a 1950's sci-fi B-movie. But these are what make the film so much fun. The film utterly embraces its own cheesiness, and never shies away from it for a second. James Rolfe is a huge fan of movies, and this film gave him an outlet for that. It's a treasure trove of references, lampoons, and shout-outs to various other works, including quite a few to his own work. Possibly one of the biggest audience reactions in the film was inspired by a reference to his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III movie review from 2007, and it was a GREAT gag. It makes fun of everything; nothing is off-limits. It even takes a stab at GameStop, and the state of modern gaming. There are also quite a few subtle background gags, similar to something you'd see in a classic-era episode of The Simpsons.

Directors James and Kevin, and the rest of the cast and crew, did an absolutely commendable job of making such an ambitious project a reality. It is truly a labor of love, and absolutely pays off. I could understand casual fans who only visit Cinemassacre for the AVGN episodes not being as crazy about it as I am. The film is NOT a two-hour long review of E.T., which I guess is what some people were expecting. Fans like myself, who enjoy the wide variety of work James has done on Cinemassacre over the years, and who enjoy poking fun at movie cliches, should feel right at home with this film. I'm proud to have this in my collection.",1431648000,,3523,4.382262996941896

6821428,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"I bought this movie to support AVGN. I have watched his videos for years and enjoyed them, for free. If you are a fan I suggest you support his efforts by purchasing the movie.
The actual movie...well, its OK. He has a weird choice of sidekicks; instead of using his real pals that were involved in the project, he has a young, frail looking black guy as a best friend. That's fine, but we have never seen the guy before and he just plain doesn't fit here. He is a good actor, he just doesn't fit the film. It should have been Mike or one of the other guys that worked with him. That alone throws off the tone of the movie into an odd tone and pulls you right out of the story.
There are some excellent parts if you are a fan of the movie, like the part about why ET was made, etc., and I think the movie would have been great if they were the only parts, with some of the filler removed.
So, the movie has some good parts, but like I said, the story and actors do NOT fit well.
Buy it to support the Nerd!",1430697600,,1006,3.985148514851485

6821430,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"Its James F*ing Rolfe...what more needs to be said?

If you are a fan of the AVGN then this is a no brainer.  If you have no idea what AVGN means then get on youtube and find out...seriously.  Anyway the nerd that we all know and love is the star of his own movie.  Of course there is a plot, and yes it involves E.T. by Atari.  It starts with the nerd making his videos and working in a game store.  Being an internet celebrity with all his followers buying everything he reviews, a corporate game company decides to target him to review their new game ""Eee Tee 2""; a game that is intentionally designed to be even worse than the famous Atari flop about a certain extra terrestrial.  As the movie progresses we follow the nerd as he goes on an epic adventure to discover if the Atari landfill is real or not...all in order to avoid reviewing the original game.  Of course I won't give away anything more.

If you like the nerd and his love of B movies and practical effects, you'll love this DVD.  There are a ton of jokes that the fans will truly appreciate and there is also no shortage of cameos!  If you are debating your purchase due to the price all I can say is: Bonus Content.  The Blu-Ray comes with a TON of bonus material including footage from the live showing of the trailer and the movie.  A built in review of the movie by the Nostalgia Critic and yes the ET review is part of this.  Plus much, much more!",1430438400,2,1421,4.214814814814815

This movie is like a nod back to the B movies of the 90's and is meant to give you laughs which it does in spades.  If you are a gamer you will love this movie.  The only reason I took 1 star is that the movie becomes stretched thin towards the end of the film since it is 2 hours long.",1430179200,,420,3.75
6821435,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"I bought this simply because i felt i owed James Rolfe at least $25 bucks for all the entertainment I've gotten from his AVGN reviews and all the other great content on Cinemassacre. Plus, he's from Jersey too and it always feels good seeing someone from neck of the woods do good.
With that said, I went into this movie expecting a train wreck, but it ended up being a low speed car accident. No real damage, but not the highlight of your day.
The movie stars James Rolfe and the black kid from the Bernie Mac show. (I didn't want to go off on a tangent but, i still can't believe someone as awesome as Bernie Mac is dead, but Tyler Perry is still alive and well. It's bulls***.) The premise of the Movie is that the Nerd is going to look the buried copies of the E.T. games, or rather proved that they aren't there at all. Simple enough. If you go into this movie expecting the same type of humor you'll find in the rest of Rolfe's work, you'll be pretty disappointed. There are a couple of great scenes that do pay homage to the web show, but they're few and far between.
So why the four star rating, right? This is what i like to call a ""hangover"" movie. It's a movie perfect for putting on in the morning after a long night of drinking. It's relaxed pace and campy feel will make you feel like you're watching an early 90's Nickelodeon show, with swearing and violence. And that's where i found the movie to shine. It's really hard to capture that kind of feeling in this day an age, and Rolfe does a great job of it ( whether he intended it or not). The movie just feels GOOD. Between the low budget effects, and the cheesey jokes, it becomes a pretty enjoyable experience if you go into it with the right mindset. The Death Mwauthzyx scenes were the highlight for me being a big Toho movie fan. How can you Now enjoy watching a giant monster break through well made building miniatures? The whole movie itself is filled with an energy and fun spirit that is rarely found in movies today. Sure, a lot of the jokes miss their mark, and there aren't as many references to the web show as i would've liked toi have seen. But at the end of the day, you can see all the hard work that went into making it, his love for cinema, and the appreciation has has for his fans. I only hope that the next movie Rolfe makes will be a horror movie. I think he would knock it out of the park.",1430006400,,2381,4.200873362445415
6821436,1,B00PSLIQ9I,"I like the AVGN webisodes, but this ""movie"" plain sucks!!!! The acting sucks and at no point did I laugh or crack a smile. Only at the very end of the movie does he give his long awaited review of the E.T. game. I ended up fast forwarding the last 30 minutes just to say I finished the movie. It sucks, it's boring, and a waste of $25 bucks.",1429920000,10,341,3.9565217391304346
6821437,3,B00PSLIQ9I,"I wasn't expecting too much when I ordered this very pricey Blu-Ray. I knew from comments I read on YouTube (and even from James Rolfe himself) that it was a low budget film with cheap, phony effects etc. But wow, I don't think I've EVER seen THIS cheap of effects in anything I've watched since the original Land Of The Lost (such as a toy car that's supposed to be the nerd van they're driving, and a doll that's supposed to be Mandi). But cheap effects isn't my biggest complaint.

My BIGGEST complaint is the actors and story. Where did James Rolfe dig these people up? The actors caused the movie to feel boring. James' friends Mike Matei and Kyle Justin (singer of the AVGN theme song) only made one cameo appearence near the end of the film. Instead, there's this super dainty guy (Jeremy Suarez I believe) who's the nerd's sidekick, so-to-speak (and totally does NOT fit in). This should have been Mike Matei (or someone portraying Mike Matei). Then there's Mandi (Sarah Glendening) who plays the reporter, who pretends to be a nerd. Which I actually liked better when she had the glasses on. Overall, I didn't mind her. But then again, WHO IS SHE?  Even though (in the web series) I can't remember the nerd ever having a female guest star. Which he definitely should start doing.

I don't mind the story about the nerd trying to find the Atari dump site with the E.T. cartridges. That was a cool concept. But nothing went the way it should have. I lost my interest about half way through the movie.  Everything just got really confusing and plain STUPID!  The movie should have been based more on the AVGN web series. But it had little to do with it. The evil Death Mwauthzyx alien robot-thing that tried destroying the earth (or whatever the heck he was doing) should have been R.O.B. The Robot. I mean, who the hell IS Death Mwauthzyx?

Even though I had little expectations, the movie failed even my smallest expectations. Oh, and the green, rubber, alien character they made to portray E.T. (or, Eee Tee) looks flat IDIOTIC!

Bottom line: It was good seeing the nerd playing in an actual fan-funded movie. But his web series is MUCH funnier and more entertaining. Even giving this 3 stars is rather generous. Many people say the movie ran too long. But it's only 114 minutes (an hour and 54 minutes). Basically the standard length of any movie. And yes, there are hours and hours of bonus extras, such as cast interviews, behind the scenes, bloopers, deleted scenes etc.

You have to be very easily amused to think this movie is great. I can't believe how many people rated this 5 stars. I'm a huge AVGN fan, and I own all of his DVD's. But this movie was a real letdown.",1429660800,4,2684,4.542443064182194

Sure it is not Oscar bait, nor is it high tech in it's visuals, but the dedication of the Filmmaker/Star James Rolfe and the many who helped put this together show through.  The script is surreal to the point of National Lampoon and Troma having a baby (fitting since Lloyd Kaufman makes a Cameo) who then has Mel Brooks as their Godfather.

in addition to a fun movie, the real jem is the special features including the documentary telling how this film got made, and what a wild ride it is.

This is the movie EVERYONE who loves the AVGN has been dying for to see and it shows. The quality is really great, reveling in the Director/Star James Rolfe's obsession with classic cult films that used Practical Effects but also showed there's a place for the new age visual effects as well co-mingled in one fan-driven product. The amount of content this blu-ray has alone is WORTH the price along with shipping. Maybe more so than the price is which is even better. The numerous Outtakes, Deleted scenes, behind the scenes (which by the way a testament of making behind the scenes fun to enjoy again i haven't felt that need to see the behind the scenes of something in a long time, kudos Mr. Rolfe) and extra features like an exclusive ""review"" by the Nerd's in character nemesis the Nostalgia Critic (played by the also hilarious Doug Walker) and Audience reaction track of the movie premiere made me feel i was watching the movie with the fans. Add in Vlogs, Interviews and more, it might even rival the Lord of the Rings Extended edition content (for an indie film project anyways)

Do not let the price bring you down it is really great, the service is really responsive and in the end you too can enjoy the greatness that is the culmination of the hard work of the devoted crew and cast and the massive budget that was achieved with the one thing the Nerd thrives and lives by: The Fans.",1428019200,,1518,4.52

6821464,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"Myself, I consider this to be a B-movie. It is a comedy with very good little bits and pieces that make it a very good, solid film that does NOT in any way disappoint from the average viewer. I have been an AVGN fan ever since I first saw his videos on YouTube back in 2007. His videos have been very funny and more often than not something that I could relate to, as I've been a video gamer my whole life ever since I was 4.
But with that besides the point, watching this while not knowing exactly what to expect, I can say that from start to finish, the story was good - not the best out there, but definitely better than I ever imagined; the acting and special effects were good - for a ""low budget"" film, it HARDLY showed until very late in, when the final fights and battles were happening, and some things became noticeable. But even then, that just added to the charm that this was NOT a ""big budget Hollywood"" film that ANY film studio can just pump out every year. I sat here in the comfort of my own home, in the background for all the years that this was being worked on, and I can honestly say that the amount of work put into this was tremendous, and is very rewarding for this long of a wait.
I've seen SO MUCH WORSE B-movies, that they make this look like a Michael Bay production, and that's considering I am NOT a fan of the direction he's taken certain franchises.
No, I did not see this in theaters when it premiered, as much as I wish I could have. Instead I waited for the Blu Ray release, and when it finally came, it is the best way to experience the film. You not only get the theatrical ""main feature"", but there's so many good ""Special Features"" to go along with it, you'll hardly find yourself running out of things to watch for a good day or two.
It's a ""road-trip"" style movie, it's a ""what do you believe in"" type of movie, it's a ""let's save the day while treating the fans to what they've been asking for, for so very long"" film!
I think if I had to gripe about anything, is that many of the known people that work behind the scenes of the actual AVGN online videos, such as Mike Metai, Kyle Justin, Kevin Finn and so on, didn't have much of an appearance or characters in the film. The former two did have cameos, but I felt like that was bad, considering they were there right from the start, or well, Mike Metai was anyway. If it wasn't for him, James Rolfe would not have even created the first two AVGN videos.
But I mean, it's not something that would take away from my rating of this film; it could just be that's how they envisioned the film being written and made, and if they're happy that way, then I am too!

Overall, if you're a fan of ""good"" B-movies, then you'll like this, whether you're a fan of AVGN or not. If you're a video gamer, you'll like this take on the story behind the Atari E.T. game and it's creator, Howard Scott Warshaw. AVGN fans will like this.",1425513600,,2910,4.18716577540107

If you're reading this, its because you're a fan. I too am banana sandwich about the nerd, but this movie was nothing remotely close to the web series. My favorite episodes would be Super Mario 3, Spider-man, Bugs Bunny, Big Rigs etc. James was my inspiration to starting my own Nes collection, but this movie had nothing to do with game reviews or the web series. It had characters not relevant to the series (mike and the guitar guy should have had main roles). Most of the games talked about where all made up. There was no Fred  the developer guy. It was random people forcing James to do a review (what?), of an Atari game. James started with Nintendo games; why not make the movie about Nintendo games? And when did James become famous in the web series? When did he start working at a game store?
Maybe this is all just too much to ask of the guy. Im sure with copyright laws and whatnots, it must have been impossible for it to actually have real games, let alone Nintendo. The jokes were indeed funny, and the effects were just what I expected form him.

TL;DR
Characters weren't relevant to web series
Plot was not relevant to web series
Not enough music, felt kind of empty in some parts, (not sure if that was an intended effect)
No Nintendo games
No game reviews (The one during the credits does not count)
No guitar guy (GET THE POWER _ NINTENDO POWER)
No mike
No power glove
No Jesus Super Mega Death Christ 2.0 Beta",1423353600,8,1526,4.369718309859155

6821507,2,B00PSLIQ9I,"I first heard of The Angry Video Game Nerd many years ago around the time that his videos first became very popular (back when he was The Angry Nintendo Nerd), and I've kept up with his videos ever since. James Rolfe, creator and star of the Nerd videos, is very talented and funny, and anybody who knows his work outside of AVGN probably also knows that he's a huge movie buff. He not only has a vast knowledge of movies, he's also been making his own low-budget and no-budget movies for practically his entire life and career. So I was excited when the idea of a slightly-bigger-budget AVGN movie was first floated a couple years ago. But now that the Bluray is finally here, I'm very disappointed to say that the movie turned out to be pretty bad.

The problem with this movie is not the special and practical effects which were very crude but also charming, nor was it any of the technical aspects of filming, all of which were actually quite impressive. Rather, the entire problem stemmed from the awful script. Everything about it was just plain bad: a confusing premise, boring supporting characters, an illogical plot, awful dialogue, and terrible jokes. A good screenwriter would have been an asset, and a tough editor should have been a requirement - cutting 20 minutes would have made it much more bearable.

There is an inherent difficulty in turning a short-form series of videos into a full-length movie, as the long list of failed SNL movies can attest (excluding at least 2 that I can think of). But I'm very confused at some of the decisions Rolfe made with this movie. First, The Nerd has very little personality here ( should we call him The Mildly Annoyed Video Game Nerd?). Second, the humor lacks any subtlety or intelligence, sticking exclusively to over-the-top gags or extremely cheap jokes (that's not a RETINAL scanner, it's a RECTAL scanner!). Third, many plot elements seemed to be crammed in with no rhyme or reason. The giant city-destroying robot seems to enter and exit the movie for no reason, and seems only to exist because Rolfe wanted an excuse to include a giant city-destroying robot. It really adds nothing to the plot, but it sure wastes a lot of time. I could go on and on, but I think the point has been made.

I really wanted this movie to be good, and it gives me no pleasure to say that it's not worth your time or money. If you find that you do enjoy the movie, the Bluray itself has some A+ bonus content: commentaries, vlogs, interviews, auditions, etc. Also included is a review of the movie by The Nostalgia Critic, probably my favorite part of the whole experience. I wish I could have better things to say, but you're better off just re-watching old AVGN videos than buying this movie.",1423008000,47,2739,4.620123203285421
6821508,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"Following the Angry Video Game Nerd's rantings since 2006, his news of a movie about this Youtube character was something I honestly scratched my head a few times, to say the least.

Flash forward in 2014 and AVGN fans can finally get their hands on the blu-ray... and what a filled-to-the-brim edition that is. James Rolfe understands what some fans love. I'm a sucker for extras, but having 10 hours of that is just plain amazing. You get deleted scenes, interviews, auditions, trailers, outtakes, VFX before and after, video blogs, audio commentary, Q&As, and more. Some studios charge full price for barebones editions. James Rolfe understands it best: he filled the thing until there was no more capacity. Like a Kevin Smith, Peter Jackson, Edgar Wright or David Fincher, ""AVGN the movie"" comes packed.

But I digress... on with the movie.

The Angry Video Game Nerd does his usual rants/reviews and gets MANY requests to review the ONE game he doesn't want to ever play... E.T. on Atari 2600. At the same time, a video game company develops a sequel to E.T. (their goals: to make it worse than the first... no easy feat). For the publicity, the company goes to the Nerd and disguises one of their employees as a sexy female nerd to accompany the Nerd and his friend on a road trip to the rumored landfill where the unsold cartridges of the E.T. game have been buried a long time ago. On his path, the Nerd finds many challenges to overcome: military, aliens, demons and more, on his quest as he tries his hardest NOT to play the ""worst video game of all time"".

Quirky, funny, deliberately campy, the movie has its own reality as much as the rest of the web series. It IS a nice change of pace to see the Nerd leave his basement and go out in the real world. The movie was well-written and for a first-time directing, there are very ambitious scenes, music (Bear McCreary: Battlestar Galactica, Walking Dead) and sets that have been incorporated into the script. Some actors deliver doubtful performances (I'll let you judge for yourself without naming him/them), at times exaggerated, but as some Ed-Wood-esque special effects point out, the acting and most of the movie, cannot be taken seriously. This wasn't intended to be Iron Man or an epic to end all epics. AVGN knows what it is and plays it very well to a knowing audience, rather than take the easy road and alienate most of its fans.

Overall, the film does suffer from a long runtime of 115 minutes, but it does make for a more than capable entertaining piece that makes this reviewer wish James Rolfe's future gets even better.

If you're a newcomer to the AVGN character, you may want to check a few episodes to see if the character grows on you. And if he does, chances are you'll like the movie.",1422921600,4,2767,4.625254582484725

Not a bad movie, full of AVGN moments, AVGN fanboys will be pleased... real dissapointment not to see known characters actively participating in storyline, just some s***ty cameos... the storyline feels ""rushed"" at times (so much going on in very short time!), and at others the argument feels ""stuck"" and redundant... many bad jokes not worthy of even a chuckle... not bad for an amateur movie though... nicely made visual effects (consider is low budget)... but if I had to choose between the internet episodes and this movie... I would bury the movie in the middle of some huge desert, around, New Mexico, for instance... along with all the copies, so others do not get scarred for life, or even worse, dissapointed for life... just sayin'.

When you consider the bowel movements that Michael Bay puts out that are in the tens of millions to produce, James did alot with so very little. The film itself was full of sophomoric toilet humor and cheesy special effects.... it was brilliant!  The pacing of the film felt good the characters were likeable, and the nerd was...well, the nerd.

6821523,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"A great fun entertaining movie just for the fans. The amount of things that happened in this is just amazing due to the fact that this was all fan funded. Car chases, giant monsters, a tank, the locations, animatronics, list goes on. Music done by Bear Mccreary is awesome with the 8 bit and 16 bit music mixed in with orchestra. This movie is simply for Cinemassacre fans so I recommend if you just watch AVGN and not any other of Jame's work you might not understand on why there's some scenes in the movie which only fans would notice (ex: board james, munky cheez reference and more). It really shows that anyone's dreams can come true and you don't really see any kind of indie movie like this since majority are around 20 minutes and are dramas or comedies. This in the other hand has it all with crazy over the top cheesy goodness and the effects on it when they actually try are pretty nice! The special features on the blu-ray are nice. They're 720p though but the movie is in 1080p which is most important. Oh yeah and when you order the blu-ray it comes with 3 stickers of some of the characters. Overall it's worth the money with the amount of content you're getting. I recommend watching it with some friends who are also a fan of AVGN. Alone is still a good experience but this really is a reaction type movie. I don't know why so many people giving this such a negative review, majority don't even do any research before assuming things and took the movie too seriously as if they were expecting some kind of serious hollywood drama type movie.

AVGN The Movie was a project a long time in the making and is a movie made possible by the fans, for the fans.  I can see where the writers were coming from in this aspect, but at the same time I feel more of an attempt could have been made to appeal to an outside audience not familiar with the nerd character.  The beginning of the film feels like that attempt was made, but by the climax and conclusion, I can see where an outsider would be lost (especially with all the other web cameos such as Pat the NES Punk and the Nostalgia Critic.)  The budget is low and the movie doesn't always make an attempt to cover this up, but as Rolfe is a fan of the classic, campy, ""B"" movies it has a certain charm.  I have read plenty of 1 star reviews from other ""fans"" on Amazon but I must question the authenticity of these people as they make citations and references to his online episodes but quote things incorrectly.  It would appear to me that a majority of these 1 star reviews are people who jumped on the bandwagon and haven't truly been watching for a long time.

6821554,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"If you're around long enough, youll get your haters, and James Rolfe and his most well known creation The Angry Video Game Nerd is no exception. Theres also going to be negative reviews for any movie, from independents to multi-Oscar winners, and unfortunately this film has a few misguided ones. Is this movie perfect? No. But, what it is is a genuine effort, ten years in the making, filled with heart, whose end result is a flat out entertaining film. A great one in fact!

First off, its impressive for what it is; a $300,000 budgeted movie, funded solely by fans.  His dedicated fans knew the style and quality of film that James would deliver and it doesnt disappoint. Also, being an independent film, it came out surprisingly fast. Due to his passion for film and his fans, it only took 2 years for this beast of a film to come out, even with its small crew. And it takes superhero movies much longer to finish, at times! And speaking of Hollywood films, James doesnt rely on big name actors or overwhelming special effects to sell this movie.

Does AVGN The Movie has special effects? Yes. BUT! The digital ones are used sparsely and only when it makes sense. For everything else, for most of the movie, its real selling point are all of the practical effects. They help make the film more genuine and it helps do what he does with every episode of AVGN; take us back to the past. With its miniatures, men in blocky robot suits, and rubber aliens this film reminds us why its better to be looking at real objects then a hodgepodge of CGI. It reminds us why we fell in love film to begin with.

The comedy is absurd and dead on. Its everything a huge production version of AVGN should be. James compared it to Waynes World and the sketchs movie and it lives up to that comparison. The characters that were not used to, as in everyone NOT AVGN, do not ruin the movie like other reviews think. Then again all reviews are opinion, so who am I to say they're wrong?

My only issue with this film would be that it, like most films, has a strong first half then slows down a bit towards the end, but not for one second was I bored or wondering when will this film pick back up. Every second of this 2 Hour masterpiece is enjoyable.
Do you have to be a fan of AVGN to enjoy this movie? Being a hardcore Nerd fan, I cant say, but for those who haven't seen it they do a nice recap in the beginning to set up the story and character. It has plenty of in jokes for Nerd fans and plenty of easter eggs for the fans of the rest of his short films on his website Cinemassacre.com
To be honest, Im one of the people who donated to this film and even drove far out of my way to see it in theaters and theres not one penny or measure of distance that I regret putting into seeing this movie.

6821560,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"'Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie is a film possessing the sure dollar mark, which distinguishes every daring entertainment venture that is created by a workman who is a master of the technique and mechanics of his medium. It is a two-hour show, filled to the last minute with brilliant incident unreeled in method and effects that sparkle with originality and invention. Within the trade, The Nerd will stimulate keener creative efforts by Hollywoods top directors.

Although the public generally will find it wholly satisfactory as living up to its unusual advance ballyhoo, the film is a job of picture producing that will make indelible impress on contemporary production. It might have been of conventional design and still qualify as a big grosser. It happens to be a first-class film of potent importance to the art of motion pictures.

Audiences, of course, will seek in the films story of a multi-millionaire newspaper publisher, polltical aspirant and wielder of public opinion such incidents that may be interpreted as uncomplimentary to James Rolfe, since the protests against the film release, which have been kept alive for the past three months, were made by executives and employees in his organization. There is, in part, a parallel of the exciting, early years of Rolfe's career and the adventures of his hero, The Nerd. But any observer of the film who possesses some slight knowledge of the private life and business activities of the publisher can scarcely interpret the screen character as a deliberate, unkindly handling of the Eee Tee Review. It cannot be denied that Rolfe has played an important role in the American scene for the past half-century, which is the period of the films story. And it is accepted generally (or, perhaps, soon will be) that the era which produced such colorful figures as the Nerd and a score of other hardy and audacious individualists in American life, is swiftly passing into history. The central character of the film is a composite, rather than either portrait or caricature.

One cannot help but wonder what all the shooting was about.

Swift moving world events since before the turn of the century until the present furnish the background for AVGN: The Movie. Story is credited jointly to Kevin Finn and Rolfe. its unfolding is unusual and original to films, inasmuch as it is related through the experiences of five separate characters, other than the main figure. It is a narrative technique not infrequently employed by novelists. Wilkie Collins told the story of The Moon Stone after this fashion.

Thus the early, rebellious, youthful years of the powerful Nerd are described by the family attorney, who neither understood nor had any deep affection for the young man. The thread is picked up by The Nerd's faithful business manager, then by his second wife, by his only earnest friend and finally by his butler. Each account spans an extended period of time, providing a different point of view and varying estimate of character. Pieced together, like a jigsaw puzzle, the parts and incidents omitted by earlier narrators are supplied by others.

When completed the authors conception of the Nerd is a man who had every material advantage in life, but who lacked a feeling of human sympathy and tolerance. It is a story of spiritual failure. While the case is well drawn and relentlessly expounded, the over-emphasis of harshness and selfishness militates against complete audience enjoyment. So intent is the effort to prove the Nerd a frustrate that no allowance is made to picture him as a human being. On this account he is not wholly real. Neither he nor his associates is blessed with the slightest sense of humor. There aren't half a dozen snickers in the film.

Rolfe portrays the chief character with surprising success, considering that the picture marks his debut as a film actor. His associates are selected from his Cinemassacre actors, few of whom have had previous screen experience. It would seem that their marquee obscurity might react unfavorably among prospective customers. The contrary is more likely, because whatever else AVGN: The Movie  may be, it is a refreshing cinematic novelty, and the general excellence of its acting is not the least of its assets. Outstanding performances are given by Jeremy Suarez, Sarah Glendenning, Stephen Mendel and Time Winters.

Technically the film benefits by The Nerd's fine photography and special effects, which include new uses of montage. Musical score by Bear McCreary is dramatic. The professional polish which brightens the production indicates that the Skinny Pilgrim studio is capable of the highest standard of output.

Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie is a triumph for James Rolfe, who overnight, so to speak, joins the top ranks of box office film personalities.

6821564,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"I have been a fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd for a few years now. I originally downloaded the movie on Vimeo when it first became available. After learning of the bonus content included on the Blu Ray release (and of course being a long time fan), this purchase was a no-brainer. The bonus content alone is well worth the $25 price tag in my opinion. While some of the videos were available on Cinemassacre.com (home of the AVGN), it is great to have them all in one place along with hours of original content.

This is truly a work of passion, and the contagious enthusiasm from the cast and crew only add to the experience. If you're an AVGN fan, you probably already own this. If you aren't a fan but are interested in the creative process that goes into an independent movie , this is also a must buy. The practical effects are fun to break apart and figure out how they were created, and the included commentaries, behind the scenes features and movie logs act as a sort of ""independent movies for dummies"" guide.",1420416000,,1020,4.425531914893617

6821567,1,B00PSLIQ9I,"tl;dr version:

Film is based entirely on James self-aggrandizing himself, with nearly every scene showing fans drooling over him. There are also politically correct characters that make no sense (random black guy shows up and a gamer girl who have no connection to the AVGN character or the web show) as well as actions such as in the end when a black guy kisses a white girl. That has NOTHING to do with an angry nerd who plays video games. This movie is awful.

Full review:

I really think James overdid the AVGN movie. It should have just been a fun comedy movie starring the nerd, Kyle, and Mike. It shouldn't have had all these special effects, giant monsters, and other nonsense.

The ""girl gamer"" and ""token black guy"" ruined the movie.

The movie was made for a 97% white male audience. Stop. Suppress your pavlovian response for a moment and please see the absurdity and unfairness of this. The two main characters were politically correct tokens inserted by some producer, and it ruined the film. AVGN is about Mike, James, and their guests.

I still don't know why this side kick just appeared out of no where to puppy dog James around. Why didn't you put Mike here instead? Someone that was actually in the AVGN videos? Instead he's downgraded to a small barely noticeable cameo while some nobody that no one has ever seen or cares about takes his place. If Mike didn't want to do it, then get the guitar guy to be your side kick. At least he was in some of the videos. It makes just as much sense for a partner for James to come along on this adventure. It just reeked of James, and Doug for that matter, being in a meeting and someone going...""look you need to diversify your audience."" Which is cool. I could dig on a black dude and a woman side character if they had any history to the nerd and the show. But they didn't. We got them shoved down our throats for the entire film.

And COMEDY. James turned this into a B movie action flick. Yes stuff blows up and action is present in AVGN episodes but that's just an afterthought. This entire film is about chases, blowing up stuff, and strange plots instead of video game reviews and how angry he is with game developers and his gaming experience.

I was enjoying the first half, but then they brought in this retarded looking green puppet and giant monster out of no where for no logical reason within the plot. The plot went from being silly to entirely nonsensical on a whim because they didn't know any restraint or focus much on the writing. As soon as the general nukes the mountain (again for no reason once so ever), that's when this movie spirals straight downhill. They just crammed in as much as they could for the sake of special effects... kind of like the modern CGI movies he's bashing in the first place. The plot should have shown more restraint and just used a guy in an alien suit with no magical out of no where giant monster senselessly smashing around. But James, loving Godzilla, couldn't help but try to make a monster movie as well, even when it doesn't belong in the movie he went through all the trouble of shoving it into.

The WORST parts about this film? The parts that make me CRINGE?? Here are a few:

In the beginning, when James is at the video store, a gamer guy comes up to him and James refuses to sell him a crappy game, so he spits on it. Then, the gamer guy gets all giddy and says, I cant wait to tell my friends I bought a game that AVGN spit on. Come on now. Are you that concerned about inflating your ego so much? This was awful.

At the end, when the black kid kisses the white girl and the politically correct crowd goes ga-ga. Uh, this is not a rom-com or some take-your-gf-out movie where theres a happily ever after. This is a movie about an angry gamer who wants to rant. Why is this scene even here?

It's a real shame Kevin Finn was allowed to co-write the film and tamper with what the plot was going to be. Finn totally ruined what made the show so good by trying to make it go Hollywood.

Consider this film to be MJ's (Jordan) years with the Washington Bullets/Wizards, Kobe Bryant going 0 for 10 or something in buzzer beaters, or Derek Jeter in his twilight years with his grandpa play. These things just don't match what the players do/are actually known for. Similarly, if the movie did not have the title ""Angry Video Game Nerd,"" you would not know this was based on that character. That's how detached it is from the awe-inspiring AVGN character.

James Rolfe has written an awful script that focuses completely on self-aggrandizement and serves up the film as a historical documentary on a video game. That would be fine but the film isn't funny because it's uncharacteristic of the nerd's character who always has ""s***(@ being blown up in his face while getting MIFFED at the game devs and/or game characters that show up in the skit."" Instead, we get the nerd who is constantly shown as a god in the film who is asked to do a game review which he doesn't want to do. Neither of these hold true about the nerd. the nerd is a common gamer like all of us who DOES like to do game reviews of terrible games.

To make matters worse, James got two actors that have no relation to the show while at the same time completely removing Mike Matei and the guitar guy from the film. the cameo for about 3 seconds was just needless footage. Overall, this entire project was a disaster. terrible choice for casting, a completely unacceptable script, and so boooooring, wow. I actually think that the 19 year old James Rolfe would have made a funnier film than this 34 year old who has so much experience.

I laughed at maybe one or two scenes and not hysterically like I did in his Super Mario 3 webisode where he calls in Jesus Christ Beta 2.0 for help in fighting off Satan or how he beats up bugs bunny and poos on him. Nope. I laughed because i felt obligated to laugh...kinda.

Was a good movie, only thing I have to say is that some of the things felt cheap (like the rocket launch [going to Mt. Fuji] to kill the nerd was from a colander) but if you watch Nostalgia Critic you'll get some of the bad editing in the movie. (like when the military woman fell to her death) It is about the nerd playing the E.T.2 video game, and they go to the legendary E.T. burial site.

It's not supposed to be an Oscar-winner nor does it conform to the style of comedy present in big-budget Hollywood comedy-movies.

6821572,1,B00PSLIQ9I,"Excited is a word that I'd use to describe how I felt when I heard they were making this movie. Dumbfounded is a word that I would use to describe my emotional state after seeing it. I have enjoyed watching the Nerd and Cinemassacre's web videos for years. I was looking forward to a film filled with winks and nods to the series and a bunch of inside jokes;and while this film does that, it also botches the delivery of that service on almost every level. This is a film for fans, there is no reason to watch it whatsoever if you're not. So, if you were thinking of renting this to support independent films or comedies, don't. The film takes the angry, bizarre character of the nerd and makes him the voice of reason in the film. He's drug into a universe where almost every person he deals with is weirder, angrier, or more mislead than he is. What's left is a strange angry loner, going on a unwanted, absurd adventure, with people he doesn't really care about to investigate a story he really doesn't want to tell. It's boring and the jokes fall flat at almost every turn. Once you get past the midway point of the movie and some of the big action sequences start, it really feels rushed and like they just gave up. The best part of the film is the end credit sequence where *SPOILERS* he actually reviews the game. The film is an endurance trial and needed heavy re-writes and edits if not a complete overhaul of the entire concept of the film. Perhaps, and this is only a perhaps, the film itself was supposed to be the motion picture parallel of the E.T. game. Maybe in order to do a motion picture review of the ""Worst Video Game Ever Made"" they decided to make the film an ""equal"" experience. The film isn't the worst film I've ever seen, there are worse to be sure; it is however something that i think amongst some groups of AVGN fans will be that ""Thing that never happened.""",1420070400,20,1888,4.3664772727272725
6821573,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"So let's start with the obvious - this movie will probably never be looked at as being a good movie, but it wasn't trying to be. This was made with the idea of being a low-budget B grade cheesy movie, and in that sense the movie succeeded. TheNerd has a niche audience, and this is very much a labor of love for them.

The movie has an absolutely crazy story, several plot holes, bad costumes some really bad green screen effects and some awful CG, but it was made that way on purpose. I fully understand what James was going for and the movie excels at that. He is not just poking fun at video games here but is giving a loving homage to bad movies.

The movie is destined to become a cult classic.

Now, once you realize what James is trying to accomplish here, you see just how talented he is. I do not think that I can think of a single director who would take on something of this scale as a first movie. The cast chemistry is excellent, the camera work, shot composition, directing, cutting and editing is brilliant, the soundtrack is wonderful. The miniatures used in Vegas are stunning and actually are on par with some of the better Godzilla movies.

Video wise this looks great as well. The team clearly understands lighting and how to use a camera colors are beautiful and natural. There is some really bad digital artifacts in some of the shots, but I don't think this is an issue with the transfer,but rather with the source material and the budget on the equipment they were using.

The special features are fantastic, and has one of the most unique features I have ever seen - an audience reaction track that was recorded at a screening. Very interesting

If you have never seen AVGN, or if you are looking for a good movie you may be disappointed. But if you want a fun movie by someone whom we are sure to hear more from in the future, and am a fan of his webisodes, pick this up - its a ton of fun in a mindless sort of way.",1420070400,2,1942,4.277929155313352

The movie is, however, aimed squarely at fans, who will love it.  If you've never seen any of the Nerd's videos, you're probably not going to care for it.

6821580,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"I have been following AVGN way back since 2007 and when the film project came about I really didn't know what to expect. Could be cheesy? too bad is good? a train wreak?
I consider myself to have a more or less attuned taste in movies and shows I watch, and The Angry Video Game Nerd movie actually surpassed any expectations I had for this project.
One can feel how James Rolfe (Angry Video Game Nerd) not only cared about this project but about his fans.
I could list flaws or things done great by the movie but that is not the point of my 5 stars review, that goes to the effort and care of those who worked on the project.",1419811200,,626,4.139344262295082
6821581,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"To me, this movie felt like one long campy, funny, over-the-top AVGN episode.  I personally loved it.  I have been a fan of the AVGN for quite some time now, so I was excited when James announced there would be a movie.  I helped back it when it was being crowdfunded, but after reading some of the negative reviews for it on IMDb, I was a little concerned.  Again, this is just my point of view, but I think James and the crew nailed it.  The music and practical effects were all well done, and for being an independent film, the acting was decent.  I thank James, Kevin, and everyone else who helped make this film a reality.  I'm proud to have it and James's autograph in my collection.",1419724800,,689,4.294573643410852

I personally found some scenes portraying the nerd in a way I personally don't think fit him well, but these scenes are few and don't interfere much to a point where I can't dislike the movie. The extras were nice, I especially liked the auditions and the Nostalgia Critic review. Glad I waited patiently for the physical release rather than download the movie. If you don't like the AVGN web series or never watched it, don't buy the movie. If you have, then I say either buy the blu-ray or buy it digitally.",1419638400,2,575,4.485714285714286

6821584,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"It actually was an ok movie. Think alot of people expected this to be a 2hr review of ET. It had alot of cameos like pat the nes punk and nostalgia critic.

Im a fan of his work and what he does. Been a fan since 2006 when I was youtubing old nes games. Could the movie have been better? Yea.. prob.. but it is what it is.. was a low budget independant film.

 It had alot of corny stuff in the movie.. they obviously couldn't get the rights to ""ET"".. So they used Eee tee.. and the ET alien they used was kinda cheap.. plus I didn't get the over the top general for area 51.. he gets his arms blown off and rides around in a 1 person tank.. plus the ending bad guy just takes off after destroying las vegas.. think if I could find something to complain about, it would be that they crammed alot into 2hrs and the movie itself is all over the place.

But overall they did put alot of work into the movie and if your a fan of his work and the avgn show.. you will like the movie.",1419552000,,978,3.9242424242424243

6821587,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"Talk about fan service.  The Angry Video Game Nerd movie is a loving tribute to retrogaming, sci-fi b movie tropes, and to fans of the nerd.  The movie's all over the place with genres with a road adventure, sci fi, and monster movie rolled into one.  The acting is b quality, but clearly intentional. It's also filled with great one liners (my favorite being, ""Even my dreams are low budget."")  In the era of you tube celebrities, the Nerd is my favorite, in part because James Rolfe has adopted a fun character in the nerd and his real life persona is genuine, showing a love Gore the craft and for the fans (who else would jam 14 hours of extras into their blue ray).  Is this the movie to end all movies?  Probably not, but it's definitely a movie for the fans.  I hope James Rolfe has a budding career beyond the Nerd though because he does bring a certain degree of fun into filmmaking.",1419552000,3,892,4.36969696969697
6821588,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"When you understand James Rolfe, you would be able to understand his special effects choices for the movie which was a reason this film got some hate.  If any of you read my tv.com review of James Rolfe, you'd know that James Rolfe is my hero and I watch him for more than just AVGN.  He is a movie buff and most of his favorite films come from the fifties and some had cheesy effects.  I admit that some of the costumes were fake and I don't care.

I really enjoy the story and this has 10 HOURS of bonus content because James himself stated he hates when a movie is released years later with the bonus content.  James has even said the movie is actually mean to inspire other people to make their own independent films.

Overall if you love AVGN and truly understand James Rolfe, this movie is worth owning.",1419465600,2,809,4.2894736842105265

6821592,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"This movie was a step up from the regular AVGN episodes.  It contains a full E.T. review (and pieces of other reviews), but most of the runtime is spent developing a plot that is as entertaining as it is silly.  The production values were much better than are available to a regular episode, and the acting was good.  In short, if you like the Angry Video Game Nerd, you'll love this movie.

My only criticisms are pretty small:  too much time was devoted to nerd fans, a good scene was cut short and the ""killer robots"" scene had awful-looking robots.  If you don't like campy movies, then that'll be a negative for you (but then it wouldn't be a proper nerd movie if it _weren't_ campy :).",1419379200,2,691,4.4015748031496065

6821595,5,B00PSLIQ9I,Now the angry video game nerd movie is finally on blu ray. I mean James took his time with bringing out the film to blu ray now i didn't get the chance to see in the theaters. So i went and watched it on demand. And now i can't Walt to own it i mean i watched it twice and loved it. How he works at gamecops instead of gamestop and plus the ET inthere is Eeettt and plus it's a different box picture then the original so check it out.,1419292800,,434,3.78021978021978
6821596,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"Okay, I rate this movie for what it is.  It's an Indy Movie done with a short budget and driven by fans.  The movie is an homage to all the people that want to make movies and can't.  The fact that this movie was produced, brought in Theater and now available in Blue-ray is amazing.  James never tried to make a classic, he never tried to make the next ""star wars"", he made a parody of his own style.  He produced a movie with crappy special effect for the sake of it, he wrote a script that while doing the job don't have anything too special about it.  James Rolf gave a movie so bad that it's good, acting so bad that I was smiling at it and a story so crazy that it works (but it's a dumb story).

This movie is the story about a guy that review crappy games for a living, he has no friends, no social life and no girlfriend.  How do you make a good movie about a guy like that?  The awnser is easy, you don't.  You make a movie that gives hommage to all the geeky buziness out there and you make it fit in the most ridicule story you can think of.  So to make sure that everyone get the joke you put all the most low budget special effect ever.  Glue everything with over the top acting and you have what you asked for, a movie about one of the most famous Internet Character of all time.

I understant why some people will gives this movie 2 or less stars, in fact if you take it at face value this movie doesn't deserve to be on DVD and much less Blue-Ray.  Some direct to DVD movie has better production than this, but they have like ten times the budget that James Rolf had to produce it and sometime they have a whole lot of investor, directors and studios behind them.  James had his personnal equipment, his investor were fans and the world was his studio.  Like I said, what he did is amazing and a sign of hope that we'll see more Indy movies in the futur, movies that will kill the hollywood recipe that we all came to hate and be disapointed in.

So I give this movie 4 star, because for a movie that cost 300 000$ to produce, which was produce by an amateur and is about a character that is over the top in the first place, it's a good movie.  I take away 1 star because the movie is a little long, it would have benefited from more editing and some part of the movie are really weak (balloney sandwich... come on at least use it later in the movie).  This movie is what it is, a parody of all the movie we (geeks) though in our head but could never produce.",1419292800,5,2476,4.047227926078029
6821597,2,B00PSLIQ9I,"The Nerd should stick to what he is famous and known for - short video reviews. This has little to nothing to do with those except is an extended aspect on the character. Medicore writing and typical indie based actors, drawn out in a long ordeal.

I've seen this before someone has a fanbase for one thing and over extends it to another. This film was fan-funded so guess for James was worth making, but between the Political Correctness factor which is very obvious and the 5 year old writing style ""Eee Tee 2"" this is not worth a BD release or buying.",1419292800,8,554,4.378640776699029

Yeah I know that it was an independent movie on a small budget but the story just sucks. It doesn't remind me of the AVGN show on YouTube an  doesn't stay true to it. I really wish there where more refrences to the show instead of this film trying to be something it's not. An  on top of that it's full of very UN funny jokes an  the pacing is really slow.

6821599,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"I saw the film in Westwood with an audience, and we had a great time with it. The movie is a mix of Wayne's World and WarGames, with over the top characters and lines that make no sense except they are cliches and tossed in for that reason. The new sidekick is there for two reasons... 1) Mike Matei (his real sidekick) is no actor, so he didn't want to do it, and I suspect 2) to show that any proper Nerd likes everyone and isn't racist. Would have been a rather lily white film otherwise. As an homage to the AVGN web series, it does run a little long, but is otherwise note perfect. The Eee Tee puppet is awful, but fits with the AVGN universe. The Death Mthausx stuff makes no sense except that we needed something to put the world in danger, coz otherwise this would be a boring film. Oh, and the score by Bear McCreary (THE WALKING DEAD) lifts the film up as well.

That said, I have no idea how this movie would play to AVGN newbies, hence the 3 star rating for strangers.

I put it at near perfect for fans because the ten hours plus of extras are great. It's everything from casting to the premiere, and as James said on his site, he hates it when you buy a disc and then you have to buy it again to get the extras. Some of the extras get a little close to being overbearing in their self-love for people on the production, but it is at least clear that this was a fun thing to create.",1419206400,,1395,4.087591240875913

Sure a couple of parts were weird and some of the characters seemed like they belonged in different places, like Kyle's guitar guy isn't behind the couch or others coming completely out of nowhere like his boss and Cooper. Nearly the entire movie takes place outside of Nerd's basement so we get to see more of his world, but it still feels authentic like your watching a really long Nerd video.",1419206400,2,565,4.4423076923076925

I think a lot of scenes went under appreciated, that is just my opinion though. I will say that there were some things that I thought were funny just from being a fan, so it might not have that grand of an appeal to everyone and maybe I'm just more forgiving.

I don't feel like he stole our money making this though, it was clearly shot well, this is still a low budget movie by all means and I can tell a lot of work went into it, even the cheesy CGI (which I'm glad they kept)

Was a fun movie for AVGN fans, unless you go into it with a cynical attitude.",1419033600,3,722,4.041958041958042
6821605,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"This movie is a real treat for fans of the AVGN web series. It's got everything you love from the show, upscaled into a giant movie! It run time clocks clocks in at 1 hour and 54 minutes, including the 7 minute ET review during the credits. I kinda wish the actual ET review was a little longer, but the focus wasn't ET itself, but rather the adventure and mystery behind it presented in the film. The special effects are old-school, very little CGI is used, giving it a very B-movie feel.

The characters are very likable, the jokes are spot on (from Nerd standards) and the film features plenty of camoes from other internet superstars. Again, this is a film for AVGN fans, so if you don't like the web series, you probably won't like the film. If you've never heard of the AVGN, this film isn't a good starting point since many of the jokes are inside jokes. You'd be better off watching this web episodes and forming an opinion there.

The Blu-ray is PACKED with bonus features, so you are really getting your money's worth here. Some of the features, especially the outtakes, are just as funny as the film. If you're also a fan of the Nostalgia Critic, his review of the film is included on the disc.

6821608,2,B00PSLIQ9I,"Of course I'm a big fan of the series -- I've been following it and all of Rolfe's side projects for years. He is the voice of a generation of frustrated thirtysomething-year-old gamers -- a voice that is smart, thoughtful, and displays a rare talent for cursing. Underneath all the ""anger"" has always been a certain joyfulness -- which is why I was so disappointed to find this film so joyless.

Interestingly, the first thing the film suffers from is a major faux pas that Rolfe often rails against in his reviews. Fans have come to enjoy and know Rolfe's cast of friends and sidekicks in his videos. Where are they? Instead, in the film we have Cooper and Mandi. Who are they? They are the Tokka and Rahzar when we wanted Bebop and Rocksteady.

The plot is promising -- the Nerd goes to dispel the rumor that there are ET cartridges buried in the desert, and instead finds out that not only are they there, but that they also contain area 51 government secrets. The problem is there are also around thirty other plots as well. It's a dense, inscrutable, and plodding nightmare of writing. You'll find yourself not caring about the numerous subplots, bored, lost, and eagerly awaiting the next clever reference to hang on to.

And there are a few clever references in here. When the movie re-creates absurd real-life scenarios of old games, you'll wish more of the movie was like this. When the film allows itself to be absurd, it's great -- the problem is it spends the rest of the film playing it joylessly straight -- playing it by the formulaic rules of ""bad movie.""

The bad special effects are here. The bad acting is here. The paint-by-numbers villains are here. It has all the ingredients for the ""bad movie"" it yearns to be. Except, as a student of film, Rolfe seems to forget the first lesson of bad movies -- they aren't made intentionally.

As a director, I trust Rolfe. There are many inspired and artistic sequences in the film. But please, for your next film, hire writers!",1418947200,12,1990,4.594366197183098

6821616,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"All the people that have been leaving hate comments and overall stupid comments that are far from being constructive/useful criticisms should have their comments removed because none of them are providing an actual review of the product.

I personally LOVED his production, anybody who's a fan of James's work will love this movie as well, I admired him for taking the chance to make his dream come true as a film creator.
Yes, many of his fans only know the Nerd, but I've watched ALL his material, if you're not into film making then a lot of the things he posts that are not ""the Nerd"" will be boring, for those of us that do like film in all it's ways, this movie pretty much culminates all his effort over the years.

Yes, this is an INDIE movie, it's a low budget movie, but it does have all the essence of the Nerd, making a movie IS NOT AN EASY TASK, those idiots saying that he stole the money from his crowd funding project DON'T know what they're saying, these idiots don't know that you need money to pay actors, crew, vehicles, location, equipment rentals, travel, etc, so don't believe what the haters say.

I saw this movie at it's screening in San Diego, I have to say I didn't know what to expect of it, only that it was going to be centered around finding the infamous E.T atari game. The acting is pretty decent, the jokes are great, there are A LOT of Easter eggs in the movie itself for those of us that have followed all his Nerd Episodes, the plot was very good, it didn't have any lose ends, it had a great beginning, development and ending, some of the effects do look a little cheezee but it's part of the movie itself making homage to old godzilla movies that James loves as well as classical horror movies, so if you like the Nerd, give this movie a chance! remember that James was always a 1 man crew when doing his reviews, so making a movie will obviously look a little strange because of what you're costumed to watch, still, well worth it.

The extras inside this blu ray should also be well worth the cost, I love watching the ""behind the scenes"" of any production, and if you do too, then buy it! I haven't done it yet, but plan to do so when I get paid next week!
And if you're not into buying the blu ray, there's always the digital download at 10 bucks, any of the 2 you choose, you're still supporting the guy that makes you laugh.",1418774400,8,2370,4.307174887892376

I have liked the Angry Video Game Nerd since he was the Angry Nintendo Nerd. James has obviously put 150% into this project and it comes across as a labor of love. You can tell the cast is genuinely having fun and it just the right amount of ""over the top"".

The extras are awesome too. You can really see how much fun they're having. If you do not like this film, then I guess you're just full of unfulfilled dreams and can't appreciate someone else realizing theirs. This is a movie made by a nerd with a vision. I dare anyone reading this to do better!",1418774400,10,719,4.286764705882353
6821623,4,B00PSLIQ9I,"This review is based on the movie itself, not the bonus features or blu ray. I have always appreciated James and his attention to detail and classic use of special effects.  This almost seems like a homage to the pre CGI days of our youth!  The cheesy effects add to the humor and that's what I love most about it.  The story itself is quite unique.  Many films of today are remakes or movie adaptations of popular teen books.  This is an original script that you won't find anywhere else.  I found it very entertaining.  This is a movie for the fans. It is quite clear with the amount of cameos and references to some of the nerd episodes.  This was a low budget, independent film fueled by fan donations and the directors determination to complete a feature length movie.  If you have enjoyed the AVGN series then purchasing this would be a great way to show your appreciation!",1418774400,3,879,4.477987421383648
6821624,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"It's an inspiring movie for independent movie-makers out there. I've been a fan of James Rolfe's work for almost ten years now, but that's not why I think this movie is good. It's good because not only does it put in all the ingredients that made me and all the other fans laugh for the last years, but also because it was made with a LOT of work, dedication, effort and sacrifice, and that James has shared that with his entire community of fans all along. Everyone was able to see the long, tedious process that it is to make a movie from the ground up, and we were all able to learn a lot about what to do and not do. That's why this movie deserves 5 stars, because it's not ""just"" a movie, it's an experience that was shared by many people.",1418774400,17,744,4.173611111111111

6821626,1,B00PSLIQ9I,"I've actually saw this for free on youtube(due to users uploading it on youtube) because I wasn't sure if the movie would be worth buying. I think people should actually try to see this before buying to judge for yourself. Now I know I wasn't expecting some high budget movie, but this movie makes the Super Mario Brothers Movie look like The Godfather in comparison. That's how bad it is. With all the cliches thrown in and bad jokes, it made not care about the movie. Think of it this way, it feels like an Uwe Boll movie. It's way over the top and it seems like James Rolfe is stroking his ego with this movie. Plus all the cheap crappy effects are very apparent, the script was just awful. Was it suppose to be funny? Because I didn't get a single chuckle out of this. You'll have a better time watching his videos on youtube than to watch this ridiculously cheesy movie that simply isn't worth your time or money. Die-hard AVGN fans will most likely buy this, along with the AVGN video game. But for the average fan like myself, this one isn't worth your hard earned money.",1418774400,14,1078,4.395

6821628,1,B00PSLIQ9I,"This movie is horrible. The nerd would of been better off just doing some reviews. Instead we get this unfunny, way to long pile of garbage with no plot what so ever. Please do not waste your money!!",1418774400,11,199,4.2631578947368425

6821630,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"James Rolfe just has a way of mixing your childhood and adulthood in the best way. Now to be straight forward I love the character of ""The Nerd"" and this movie just topped everything that has been done so far with the character. The movie itself has everything, a great fun story that is hilarious through and through, military conspiracies, old school practical effects, extra terrestrials, Kaiju, sexy woman on woman fighting scenes,  zombies and even a fun ""educational"" moment in the very beginning of the film... but don't worry it's not THAT educational haha. If you love not only the AVGN series but also action, comedy, sci-fi, gaming and much more this movie is definitely for you!

Now the Blu-ray itself is packed to the BRIM with special features and actually has a high quality overall design to it. First thing I noticed when I opened the case was 3 fun little stickers that kind of just said ""Hey, here's a little something extra for the fans"" which to be honest I really appreciated. When you pop the blu-ray in the menu comes up with the painting of the Nerd (as seen on the case cover) surrounded by a fun 8-bit aesthetic, the AVGN theme as heard in the beginning of the feature and clips showcasing the feature film in a fun overall environment. I found this was surprising because I was kind of expecting the menu of a dollar store DVD, bare and straight to the point! But no they went ALL OUT. Easy to navigate the main menu comes up with a play movie option which has multiple audio options including a fun commentary that has a ton of factoids and fun little side notes from the days they were shooting, a scene option and of course a bonus feature option. All of the bonus features (vlogs, cast interviews, music and sound production, post effects, etc.) are edited very well, feel like a high quality documentary and there is a TON OF IT. I mean their are so many bonus features with such great content it might as well be the 50th anniversary edition of the blu-ray. I have to say I was in love with this movie from the beginning but the blu-ray just added a whole new crazy dimension to the experience and I have to say it is seriously my blu-ray pick for the year. Do yourself a favor and pick it up RIGHT NOW!",1418688000,15,2238,4.442822384428224

6821633,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"If you are an AVGN fan you'll like the movie. I don't work for cinemassacre. I enjoy their media. Is it a blockbuster movie? No. It's way better than any Michael Bay film i've seen in the last decade though.  As a big fan of James and cinemassacre I waited for this movie. I bought it digitally as soon  as it was available. Is it an amazing movie? No. However, watching all the updates and seeing all the set backs  and all the effort that was put into making this thing... It's an inspiration. I have watched a man fulfill his dream of making a movie. I love it.",1418601600,34,564,4.155963302752293
6821634,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"Even the music composer of The Walking Dead TV series was so excited about this, that he contributed the soundtrack to this campy, crazy, and totally retro independent movie.  The Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie has it all: miniatures, visual effects, fake blood, puppets, F16s, zombies, 8-bit games, lasers, explosions, a gigantic foil ball, and an even bigger Japanese robot.  All of this is centered on the Angry Video Game Nerd's quest to disprove that a bunch of ""Eee Tee"" videogames were buried in the desert decades ago.  Grab a Rolling Rock beer, relax, and enjoy the awesomeness of this crowd-funded masterpiece.  For part 2... what's at the end of the LJN rainbow perhaps?",1418601600,13,683,4.913043478260869

8689095,5,B00PSLIQ9I,"James is a rare artist in a sea of people pushing content to simply generate views, subscriptions, and revenue. I've been watching him since one of my best friends showed me a few of his videos he downloaded in 2006. He's one of the few who values the story, the laughs, and the art that is cinematography. Once you finish this series and watch the AVGN Movie, make sure you watch his commentary and behind the scenes video. His special effects and camerawork are a fantastic throwback to the 70s and 80s style that brought so many people to the theaters and made cinema synonymous with popular media. This series eschews production value for engagement, CGI for laughs from the audience, and chasing the almighty dollar for having a fanbase who loves what he loves to do. I cannot recommend this enough.",1530057600,,804,4.669014084507042
8689096,1,B00PSLIQ9I,"Look i love the avgn. I really wanted to like this movie but its boring, not funny, not enough video gameplay...yea copyrights right? I know james worked really hard on it, but the weird uninteresteing characters, and boring plot (although nice plot premise about the atari landfill) just makes this a pass. Mike matei is bearly in this movie. I wish he replaced the black kid, and don't get me started on the general. So much cringe. I'd rather have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in my ear then watch this movie again.  Atleast that nerdy girl is hot",1528934400,,552,4.52
