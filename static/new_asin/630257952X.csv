7827881,5,630257952X,"I thought Susan Lucci played a good part in this movie,  but of course all of her movies are really good.  I thought it was a real thriller, and i am going to buy it now.  Susan Lucci is my favorite actress.  I think this is the best movie that i have ever seen in my whole life.  And thats the truth.  Whoever wrote the scripts did a wonderful job!  And of course all of the actors did a wonderful job as well.  Well hope you like my little comment about the movie.
Sincerely,
