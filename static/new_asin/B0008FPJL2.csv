2258741,2,B0008FPJL2,"""Kodocha"" was one of the first manga series I bought, and it's always been one of my very favorites.  I knew there was an anime, so of course, I was very excited when I heard that it was coming to the US.

I'm not one of those people who hates anime based on manga because it's ""not as good as the original"".  But I really did not like ""Kodocha"".  The first problem was the voice acting.  Sana was fine in the English, but Akito's voice was way too deep.  In the Japanese, I didn't like Sana's voice very much.

My biggest problem was the way Sana was portrayed.  They made her way too silly and obnoxious in my opinion, and it's really hard to take her seriously.  She was a little air-headed in the manga, but I really think the anime overdid it.

Overall, I would advise you to just stick with the manga.",1122768000,,807,4.181818181818182
2258742,5,B0008FPJL2,"Kodocha consists of total of 102 episodes and is divided into 3 seasons

I highly recommend this show if you haven't seen it before, the show and book is similar in some way and differ in some way

In my opion i like the manga better than the anime, the anime was a bit dissapointing, espically the ending (sorry about the bad spelling)

you should give the anime a try, but i also sugest reading the manga if you planning on watching the anime

i seen the anime in japanese but i'll probuly plan on getting it in english also

you might like the show if you like funny movies, i also recomend marmalade boy, ultramaniac, super gals, kaleido star, and fruits basket if you like kodocha, hope this review help",1122163200,3,708,4.374045801526718
2258743,4,B0008FPJL2,"As a long time fan of the show back to its original airing in Japan nearly a decade ago, I am glad to finally see it in America.  However, most anime fans are purist.  First of all, the name was changed from ""Kodomo No Omocha"" or ""Child's Toy"" to the shortened ""Kodocha"".  Kodocha was the name of the fansubbers who subtitled the series.  So it took me awhile to even realize it was in America.  Second, like everyone else, I noticed the fabulous rock/pop opening sequence from season one was deleted.  This may be because in it, Hayama (Akito) was groping Sana-chan in one scene.  That brings about the bigger problem.  Though the show is hilarious, it also has a tendency to deal with some issues using kids that might make parents uncomfortable.  This may be the reason for some heavy handed changes.  One of the most glaring changes I noticed was dialogue, especially in the dub.  In the original, Sana likes to call her manager her pimp and talk about him like he's her lover because she's too young to understand what is happening when she gives him her money or that he leaves her room after she falls asleep.  Also, when he goes to her room, the mother gives him a strong warning about appropriate behavior that was changed in both the english and japanese versions.  Another change is when Akito's friend helps Sana-chan.  He likes her but Sana thinks he's gay and hits him.  Because they completely changed that conversation, now you don't know that he has a crush on Sana-chan.  Since it comes up again in future episodes, there will probably be even more changes to dialogue.  Still, this treatment of ""Kodocha"", does not lose the heart of both the first episodes of the series or the original OAV.  It is still the tale of how a wacky little girl and her unconventional family are able to help people with serious problems that are not as fortunate.  While I do think it's nice that such a wonderfully entertaining show is now in America, I do hope that producers will allow the original brilliance to show through without any more changes to the story in future DVDs.",1148515200,2,2081,4.575675675675676
2258744,3,B0008FPJL2,"As stated in the title, I thought it was so so. The first reason I even looked at this anime was beause the characters looked so much like the main characters from Marmalade boy (an anime I love)

overall

sound 4.1

plot 7.3 (thats saying alot)

characters 7.1

packaging 5.1

extras 5.0 (what I usually expect from Funimation)

2258745,1,B0008FPJL2,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Seriously.

My first clue that this DVD release was botched should've been the company that released it: FUNimation. You know, that same company that butchered Dragonball in its various forms. So I expected a few edits, especially that Sana-chan would likely not refer to her manager as her pimp. Sadly, that seems to be one of the few things they got right.

First thing I noticed was the ommission of the original S1 opening, ""Juu-kuji no News."" Supposedly this is due to licensing issues. However, a scene was omitted as a result of this, and the opening they used contains minor spoilers for much later episodes. Also, the Jp audio cuts out in multiple places, which is jarring and slightly painful given the show's frenetic pace.

I was unable to get beyond the first few minutes of ep 2, as the sound cut out for the third time and I just gave up. Thankfully I still have my fansubs.",1133827200,7,923,4.514970059880239
2258746,4,B0008FPJL2,"If I were you guys, I would go and buy the japensese version, and read the english subtitles on ebay. That's what I did and plus its the whole set not just a part of it so you don't have to wait for it to come out",1131580800,2,213,3.5531914893617023
2258747,3,B0008FPJL2,"This show is completely bizarre, but I think it's great. It's about eleven year old Kurata Sana and her school work (she's a popular actress). She lives with her mother, an author, and her manager, who she found homeless on the streets.

This show is although totally weird, really good. If you get a chance to watch it do so.",1127952000,,326,4.433333333333334
2258748,4,B0008FPJL2,"I've been a fan of Kodomo no Omocha through fansubs for years, and am happy to actually be able to buy it on DVD.  It's a great show, tons of fun.

However, the DVD release is horrid.

The first thing I noticed was - that's not the first season opening sequence and song.  It's from a later season.  And that's the attention to detail that carries on.

There was a short sequence in the japanese track on the first episode (where Sana meets the singer of the theme song (that no longer exists)) where the audio no longer exists, and there's no subtitles.  That's a problem.

They put a lot of effort into trying to americanize it for the dub, but messed up on the basics.  I'll still buy the rest of the series - but watch it on my fansub versions.",1124668800,10,748,4.211267605633803
2258749,5,B0008FPJL2,"I came across this series several years ago and have watched the whole thing since. The first half especially is charming, wacky and new. the second half of the series or Junior High school, is not very good at all, not because the Author of the seires loses her touch (in the manga) but because this long TV series neglects to follow the original story line in the second half. This means a whole lot of filler and no content. What miho obanna did wonderfuly in a `10 volume manga is done teribly owning to the second half in a `102 episode series. It is not alltogether the fault of the japanese producers of this tv series. originaly Miho Obanna was planing to make the series go on for 8 volumes instead of ten. that is what the TV producers were counting on. The change of plan led them to change parts of the plot and screw up  the wonderful ending to the manga. It is because of the bad ending as well as the large amount of completly taseless and juvanile filler that this series is disapointing. Although the first half is much better, the firs half of the actual  plot of the manga is completly exausted by episode 30 or 35. the first half is more true to the original plot and the filler is much better.

I predict that by the time the second half of the series gets out, loyal fans will flock to buy it. they will soon realize however that after a while they are watching dvd after dvd of filler. It is prety aparent where the plot diverges and becomes tastless.

I know anime is expensive and that is why I recomend buying the ten volume manga at a good price. It is SUPERIOR in quality.  you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars to buy a long series that will disapoint you and your wallet in the end.",1124150400,,1718,4.257668711656442
2258750,5,B0008FPJL2,I came across this series as a fansub of the OAV about 7 years ago and quickly fell in love with it and found the fansub for the whole series.  Marmalade Boy on crack is the best way to describe this series.,1123372800,,207,3.9285714285714284
8055990,5,B0008FPJL2,"ANYTHING KODOCHA IS AWESOME!
I just love this anime and the manga is even better.
Everyone should check this out. Trust me.

8055991,5,B0008FPJL2,"This anime is an adorable anime and it's quickly become one of my favorites. I wish it was showing on tv though. (At one point it did, but I missed it). It's really cute.",1384387200,,170,4.029411764705882
8055992,5,B0008FPJL2,"Sana is an 11-year-old TV star. Her show, Child's Toy, is very popular. You would think that a girl that's a TV star would have a wonderful life. That's true, until she gets to school. Akito Hayama, aka ""the Money Boss"", is causing all sorts of trouble at school. Learning is impossible with all the boys raising hell. Sana hatches a plan to rectify the problem. After her school is a healthy environment, Sana learns more about Akito and his sad living situation. She then decides to turn his life into a happy one.

This anime is so off the wall. I haven't seen one quite like this before. It has good animation (for 1996), great voice acting, and a fun soundtrack. I think that my favorite part of this series is Laura Bailey's voice acting job. She does an excellent job. I think it may be one of the better voice acting jobs I've ever heard.

There are plenty of cool characters in Kodocha. There is also a good mix of comedy and drama. Although this anime is ridiculous most of the time, it does have some serious situations, and some dramatic moments. It's totally fun. It's a shame that it's so expensive. Most of the time, you can get out of paying a high price for anime if you shop around. Unfortunately, I don't think you can avoid it in this case. I still recommend it, and I think it's a show that every anime fan can enjoy.",1358899200,,1338,4.348
8055993,4,B0008FPJL2,I bought Kodocha vol. 1 cause I used to watch it when I was younger and I loved it when I was younger and I still do. Kodocha is pure humor. You don't know what's gonna happen. Sana is a surprise though out the whole thing. Her songs that she sings is so hilarious. Akito Is this trouble one that you seem to hate but find yourself loving his character. The dubbing is awesome. I love the actors in it and this series Is a fresh of breathe air.,1313798400,,444,4.0
8055994,5,B0008FPJL2,"I saw these episodes online (first) and absolutely loved them!  It's even better on my T.V. now.

This DVD features Sana as she deals with classroom troubles (namely Akito and his cronies.)  It introduces the characters very nicely, and after watching later episodes (which you will want to see,) you can see the growth.  Character development is done so naturally and believably (???) that it keeps your interest.  You see her back at school from missing it due to work and trying to get her studies straight.  She gets sick of the chaos in her classroom from the boys and starts obsessing over how to get them to stop (yes... all 4 episodes feature this plot in different ways.)  Sana finds herself getting involved deeper and deeper into the personal life of her classroom rival (Akito.)

The classroom plotline quickly takes a back seat after these episodes.

Now for my favorite part... the comedy!  This is a very funny show if you're into family-type sitcoms.  The humor is relatively clean (This DVD has less content/language issues than future episodes, but if you can tolerate language and content in the show Friends, this is nothing far from that in that respect.)  Sana is hilarious!  She has such a unique way of thinking, so even though something may start to look predictable, she turns it in unexpected directions.  Her rapping is always fun to watch.  In this DVD, she's the main source of the humor. (although Akito continues getting funnier as the show progresses.)  Her energy is refreshing and can make even the dramatic parts fun to watch.  The voice acting was done perfectly for her!

Rei can be funny too.  He's Sana's ""manager, boyfriend, and pimp!"" as she puts it (not knowing what a pimp really means at her young age.)  He tries to be there for her, and lets you know that he won't let anything drastic happen to her.

As far as the individual episodes go, episodes 1 and 3 were my favorite on this DVD (14 and 15 are my favorites that I've seen.)  Episode 1 made me really like the characters, so if it dropped into some drama in other episodes, I knew humor was on the way because of how the characters were presented.  Episode 3 had Sana getting way too cocky (figuring she had a way to beat Akito) which was fun to see how she handled getting knocked down a notch.  It also had a very funny ending.  Episodes 2 and 4 were still very funny (2 had one of my favorite parts, as well as my 5-year-old son's favorites.)

All the episodes kept me wanting to see what happened next though, and seeing the characters finally interacting a little differently in episode 4 than episode 1 let me know that character development was taken very seriously (in a funny way.)

It plays out like a sitcom with a good growing story.

Some people may not like the hyperness of this DVD, but it adds to the fun carefree attitude Sana tries to carry with her.  This is a character trait that matures in her, so if that's the reason for not watching it, then know that it becomes more selective at all the right moments.

This DVD is good for kids and adults.  I love it as well as my 8-year-old daughter and my 5-year-old son loves when Sana is crazy or singing.",1218499200,,3175,4.517543859649122

8055996,5,B0008FPJL2,"This anime series is great.  I'm glad Funimation dubs Kodocha.  They do a great job, and honestly if it was someone else, this series would get cut up pretty bad.  The only major change is in the opening sequence...  They could not acquire the rights to the 1st season opening, so the 2nd was used in it's place.  The Kodocha DVDs are dubbed & uncut, and feature lots of laughs, some serious drama, and a nice art style.

The only disappointment is there's only 4(!) episodes per Volume.  Don't you think they could fit more on a DVD than that??  Keep in mind, this is a show 102 episodes long.  That comes to 26 volumes at the rate they are going. -_-;;  Well, be prepared to part with your money -- you're going to love this show.",1164758400,8,732,4.2773722627737225
8055997,5,B0008FPJL2,"Kodocha is just so funny and fantastic and wonderful.  It's one of the few shows where I laugh out loud during almost every episode, yet it also maintains an air of poignancy that sometimes moves me to tears.

A lot of people are complaining about Funimation's release of the series.  I am not.  I never even thought there ever would be an English language release of such an ecletic series.  This is a nice starter box for your collection, and it comes with a Babbit purse which I must admit I find terribly adorable.  The sub stays true to the original series, and the only place it deviates is with an early scene in the first episode where a guest appearance is made by a member of the band Tokio.  Tokio did the opening song for the original Japanese version, which has been cut out of the Funimation version.  This is because Tokio wanted an excessive amount of money for Funimation to be able to license the song for the use of the English release and they apparently weren't willing to bargain.  Funimation chose to remove the song entirely from the series rather than continue negotiations with Tokio.  I think the removal of the song takes away from the series, but it's still better to have Kodocha without the song than to not have it at all.",1158796800,6,1254,4.484581497797357
8055998,5,B0008FPJL2,This is one of my favorite series. I enjoyed fruits basket of course (didnt everyone) though this is different (much more humorous) it has the same humor that gets me crying Im laughing so hard. I never saw it in Japanese so like the other reviews I don't know what Im missing but I don't care because I love this anime. I just got done watching the 6th DVD and pre-ordered the 2nd box set and I cant wait to get it. Take the time to watch the first DVD Im sure you will love this one. Sana is adorably whacky. The characters are all a riot this is one of the funniest animes ever! My friends and I who don't always see eye to eye on anime all love this one!!!,1155945600,5,660,4.007575757575758
8055999,5,B0008FPJL2,"The first disk in this series is suitable for all ages.  However, the second and third disks of this series contain some questionable language.  Therefore, I recommend that parents view each of the first three disks in their entirety before deciding whether to allow children under age 14 to view them.  Please note that the language is not purely gratuitous.  Rather, it is a small part of the plot.  The lead character, Sana, is a rambunctious 11 year old with a habit of using words that she does not fully comprehend.  Further into the story, she is very ubruptly but tastefully corrected.

Other than the language issues, the series is quite entertaining and perhaps even educational.",1152921600,2,689,4.887931034482759
