The American sites in Massachusetts and New Hampshire were built with existing rocks and the terrain was different from that of Stonehenge on the Salisbury Plain, which was fairly flat with few trees. Both sites include markers which mark the summer solstice and other events in the heavens. See Stonehenge Decoded from Nat Geo and Secrets of Stonehenge from NOVA.
Let's compare the native America religions with the Christian religions extant then and today. If you read Zeitgeist: The Movie you will find that the Christian religion borrowed heavily from the Egyptians and other ancient cultures which were heavily influenced by astronomy. The Catholic Church converted aspects of sun worship to worship a son of God named Jesus and ignored astronomy. And Zeitgeist says that there is little evidence that our son of God actually existed.
The Native Americans had a religion that was based on spirits who lived on the land and believed that people should not own the land, which was sacred. The Christians believed that God lived far away in the Heavens and did everything they could to convert the Native Americans to Christianity, which did not appeal to them.",1383091200,,1328,5.013574660633484
