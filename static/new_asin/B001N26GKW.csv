8322890,5,B001N26GKW,Great dvd that captures the essence of DI live. For sure the best thing to ever come out of canada...well maybe except the fur traders.,1253664000,,135,4.44
8322891,5,B001N26GKW,"I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for this instant classic. These ""Quebecois"" (i.e. Canadian) deathcore masters have released the best live DVD I've seen in a long time. Watching the drummer do 200mph blast beats and hyperblasts is impressive enough, but the whole band really puts on a great show and plays almost flawlessly all the way through. The surprise guest appearance (I won't spoil it) is VERY cool, too.

I already liked these guys a lot, and after watching this show... I think I have a metal crush on them. Buy it!!!",1242518400,,535,4.752688172043011
8322892,5,B001N26GKW,"So far one of the best DVD concerts I've ever seen. Despised Icon shows in this performance why they separate from others groups of its own genre. Just imagine songs from previous releases being played EXACTLY as they sound on record, accurately agressive blast-beat on drums and wall-smashing riffs. Perfect as if it were a playback, BUT IS NOT! Is Despised Icon bringing the mosh to an excited and out-of control crowd. This particular show was so great not only for the brutal performance and setlist they gave, it was also one of the last shows for Sebastian (bassist) and shows the appearance for former members, playing some old school stuff that will show you how brutal this band was from the beggining. Documentary disc shows stuff from the road, the tours, videos and stuff every fan from DI would love to know. F*** buy it and f*** enjoy it! It worths its price!",1239840000,6,873,4.675324675324675
