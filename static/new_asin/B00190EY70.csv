The Eiffel Tower information was slightly more indepth compared to the almost non-existent Empire State Building information.  The repective DVD's about the Eiffel Tower and Empire State Building seemed more like a Chamber of Commerce approved tourist logs. The Eiffel Tower DVD was slightly more informative but only just so.  There was lots of useless footage of stupid human interest stuff that had nothing at all to do with the actual buildings.  The DVD's never get into anything technical or interesting about the buildings.  I am a technical geek sort of guy and this DVD told me absolutely nothing about either the Empire State Building or Eiffel Tower that I did not already know.  This treatment of the Empire State Building and Eiffel Tower is more cute fluff than anything remotely interesting regards the study of the design of either building.  I tried to like this DVD but, to qoute Men On Film \ In Living Color this Empire State Building and Eiffel Tower DVD just left me flat.  This is the kind of DVD a boring teacher would pick for their class to watch.  This DVD about two exciting Marvels is about as fascinating as drying paint.

So why did I give the DVD 3 Stars you might ask?  Well even if its contents are presented in the most lack luster boring ways, we are still talking about the Empire State Building and Eiffel Tower two awesome technological acheivements for this or any age.  Yeah Yeah the Burj is taller but we in the United States built super tall buildings first and all the terrorism in the world can't take that from us. :)",1354579200,,1736,4.637254901960785
