(Fellow-Goon Harry Secombe appears in the ""Envy"" segment.) The large cast also includes one of ""The Two Ronnies"" and skin mag publisher Bob Guccione.

A fine concept, short humorous pieces on the seven Biblical vices is diluted by a total lack of directorial continuity. Each segment has its own style, much to the detriment of all. Fans of Benny Hill's girl-ogling skits as well as those who favor late-60s BBC-TV comedy may find much to like here however.
