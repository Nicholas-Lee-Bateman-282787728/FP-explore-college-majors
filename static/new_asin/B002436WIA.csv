3843106,2,B002436WIA,"This was easily the weakest ppv effort from WWE thus far this year.  It wasn't a horrible show, but it was not very good and I did not enjoy it.  It was very overbooked and the last few matches felt rushed because they were pressed for time.  While their was one outstanding match, I definitely do not recommend spending your money on this dvd release because one match isn't worth it.  If you want to see it rent it, but don't go further than that.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. Scramble Match for the ECW Championship (by order of entry)
Christian vs. Jack Swagger vs. Finlay vs. Tommy Dreamer (c) vs. Mark Henry

Decent opener that had its moments.  It really became a cluster by the end and there were a few botched spots, but overall this was entertaining.  Crowd was really behind Christian but Dreamer retains.  **1/4

2. Mask vs. Intercontinental Title Match
Chris Jericho (c) vs. Rey Mysterio

Excellent match, the best of their series thus far.  Just too many great spots to mention including tons of tremendous near falls.  I thoroughly recommend finding a way to see this match, it was one of the best WWE bouts of the year thus far.  It's arguable that this has been the best fued in wrestling in 2009.  ****1/4

3. No Disqualification Match
The Great Khali vs. Dolph Ziggler

Match was pretty bad but it was kept mercifully short.  Khali sold most of the match and you needed to see it to believe it, just horrendous.  Kane returned at the end and beat down Khali with a chair allowing Ziggler to get the win.  Why this was on the card taking up time I have no idea.  *

4. Triple Threat Match for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship
The Colons (c) vs. Cody Rhodes & Ted Dibiase vs. Edge & Chris Jericho

The match was originally booked as Priceless vs. The Colons but Teddy Long came out before the match started and added Edge and Jericho (no complaints here).  Still, this was pretty much the match that was originally scheduled because Edge and Jericho were literally in the ring for less than 10 seconds combined.  That being said, there was no heat for anything that the Colons or Priceless did, but it was a well worked match.  Edge hits a distracted Carlito with a spear to win the titles for himself and Jericho.  This has an upside because Edge and Jericho are great and will probably make a really fun team, and they now have the option of fueding with all 3 brands as the Unified Champs.  **

5. WWE Women's Championship Match
Melina (c) vs. Michelle McCool

Not bad for a women's match, but nothing to write home about either.  Michelle gets the relatively clean win with the Styles Cla...excuse me, the faithbreaker.  This didn't need to be on the card.  *3/4

6. World Heavyweight Championship Match
CM Punk vs. Jeff Hardy

Dissapointing Match.  I was expecting a really great match with these two but it was merely above average.  It started slow and it felt as though they were building to something good, and then the match ended.  Hardy got the pin but Punk's foot was under the rope so it was restarted, and then while ""blinded"" from an elbow, Punk kicked the ref for the DQ.  Creative finish that helps build Punk as a heel, and allows for the fued to continue.  Match itself was a letdown, though.  **3/4

7. John Cena vs. The Miz

This just angered me.  This was nothing more than a glorified 5 minute squash match.  The story of the match, I kid you not, was that Miz was not in Cena's league.  Cena OUTWRESTLED Miz at every turn, with some of the worst technical wrestling I've seen in quite some time.  And they wonder why their young talent doesn't get over.  Miz taps to the stf with both hands like a 12 year old girl, and in the process was buried about 20,000 leagues under the sea.  I hope this isn't the end for him because he has great potential, but this was really distressing to watch.  *1/2

8. Three Stages of Hell Match for the WWE Championship
First Fall: Standard Match
Second Fall: Falls Count Anywhere Match
Third Fall (if necessary): Stretcher Match

This was pretty much a Stretcher Match, because they were pressed for time and got the first two falls out of the way in about 5 minutes.  There were some interesting spots and I thought they used the stretcher well, but the match wasn't all that interesting.  If you're looking for a really brutal match, you won't find it here.  This fued is impossibly stale and it gets harder and harder to watch these two perform, despite the fact that they were working hard.  The match was pretty good but no where near as good as they matches they had for free on television.  Orton retains with help from the rest of Legacy.  Yee Haw.  **3/4

One fantastic match does not make a good ppv.  Granted, I have seen far, far worse shows than this, but this wasn't even up to par with the rest of the ppvs WWE has given us this year, most of which have been very good.  Rent this for the IC title match, but skip the rest, it'll be forgotten by everyone who saw it in less than a week.",1246233600,3,5000,4.4144736842105265

8350223,2,B002436WIA,"ECW Champion Tommy Dreamer Vs. Christian Vs. Jack Swagger Vs. Finlay Vs. Mark Henry (Championship Scramble Match) - This was a decent opening bout but more importantly, a heavy step down to the last ECW Championship Scramble match. The match was nothing past the fans being behind Christian all the way, Jack Swagger continuing to be dominate in his ""rookie"" year, and Tommy Dreamer retaining his title in the end. Decent opener but nothing to write home about. 3/5

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho Vs. Rey Mysterio (Mask Vs. Title Match) - Amazing Intercontinental Championship bout between these two. With each individual prized possessions (Mysterio's mask & Jericho's title) up for grabs in this match, you knew these two were going to up their game and put everything on the line here. This is a great back and forth match with excellent wrestling and a strong aerial display. Like they previously done at Judgment Day and Extreme Rules, these two delivered a classic. 5/5

Dolph Ziggler Vs. Great Khali (No Disqualification) - This was nothing more past making Dolph Ziggler the new number 1 contender for the Intercontinental Title and the return of Kane. 1/5

WWE Unified Tag Team Champions Carlito & Primo Vs. Legacy Vs. Edge & Chris Jericho - The duo of Edge and Chris Jericho being thrown into the mix came about after a few backstage segments involving Teddy Long interacting with Edge, Jericho, and Mr. McMahon earlier in the night. Even though the match was advertised as a Triple Threat match, Jericho and Edge was in the ring for no more than 10 seconds as they left Legacy to battle Primo & Carlito all of the match until the end. In the end, a decent tag team match but a horrible triple threat bout. 3/5

WWE Women's Champion Melina Vs. Michelle McCool - This match is a shocker IMO. These two actually went out there and put on a pretty good divas match for the Women's Title. Alicia Fox was in the corner of Michelle's but nothing is heard from her in the match. Overall, an entertaining bout between Michelle and Melina with their rematch at Night of Champions a month later being just as good. 3.25/5

World Champion C.M. Punk Vs. Jeff Hardy - Not ever competing in a match before that I know of, CM Punk and Jeff Hardy blended in well together that showed CM Punk still making that full ""heel"" turn around. The match went back and forth with a nice series of reversals and counters with Punk able to ground Hardy to stop him from using his aerial offense. They told a good inring story that displayed Punk not able to put Hardy down which forced Punk to use dirty tactics to keep his title in the end. Some might be disappointed with the end but IMO, it was a good way for Punk to make that transition into a ""heel"" while leaving room for this feud to continue. In my book, this was a good and entertaining match. 3.5/5

John Cena Vs. The Miz - I guess this was a way WWE tried to get fans to cheer for Cena or it was a way to elevate the Miz's status. Either way you want to look at it, the match flat out sucked! Cena ""carried"" the Miz the whole time while using ""wrestling holds"" to do so. In the end, Cena hits a mega F-U then proceeded to lock in the STF-U that made the Miz tap out like a little girl for the win. This is a match that should be erased from all wrestling records! 0/5

WWE Champion Randy Orton Vs. Triple H (3 Stages Of Hell Match: Straight Wrestling, Falls Count Anywhere, Stretcher Match) - This was the conclusion of the McMahon/Triple H and Orton feud, so this 2 out of 3 falls bout was made out to be this hellicious and brutal confrontation but the bottom line is after the number of times HHH and Orton have competed against each other over the years, this bout came off stale and boring. And with the match being made just a week in advance, this match recieved no hype at all. The first two falls ended in a matter of minutes which forced the match to go to the 3rd fall very quickly. The two utilized the stretcher very stragetically and offensively that saw the match coming close to being over a few times. Legacy interferred and helped Orton to retain his title in the end. So overall, the Stretcher Match came off as an entertaining bout but the whole 3 Stages Of Hell Match came off rather stale and disappointing. Their Last Man Standing Match that occurred on free TV was better than this. 3/5

Over the years, The Bash has not been a very good event for the WWE which is probably why the Pay Per View is no longer with us. This is one that I do not recommend. You can catch the Mysterio/Jericho bout on the ""Greatest PPV Matches 2009-2010"" DVD because this event is not worth purchasing just for one match.",1280707200,4,4678,4.450408401400233
8350224,1,B002436WIA,This PPV failed to live up to expectations largely due to bad booking. The 3 Stages match between HHH-Randy Orton was nothing compared to thier match they had on the Monday before The Bash and it was stale as month-old bread. The Miz-John Cena match had pretty much the worst finish and it failed to help elevate Miz as a viable competitor. The match of the night and the ONLY good match was the mask vs. IC title match between Y2J & Rey-Rey mainly becuase they had great chemistry with each other. The rest were also stale. I give this event a 1 and a half out of 10.,1278028800,,568,4.220183486238532
8350225,4,B002436WIA,"I'm put in a strange situation:
""The Bash 2009"" is surely going to be one of the most disliked events of the year.  So, I tried to join the crowd and just trash away at it.  But I have to be honest, and admit that I enjoyed myself.  I never once felt like turning off my DVD player.  So, I guess I'll plug away at the review, and see what happens:

1) ECW Championship Scramble
---In case you don't know the rules, basically two wrestlers compete for a few minutes, and then another one enters.  After all five guys have entered, the 5 wrestlers only have a few more minutes to compete.  Whoever has the last pinfall or submission victory before the time limit expires will walk away as the champion.  Christian and Jack Swagger started things off, and worked very well together, like they always do.  Finlay is always a reliable performer.  I hope WWE realizes the value in having a hard knocks worker like Finlay with their company.  Tommy Dreamer (the champion) and Mark Henry did what we expected them do as the hard-working veteran and giant athlete, respectively.  I guess my overall reaction is that I enjoyed this Scramble Match, especially when all five men are...well, scrambling to get the title with very little time left.  However, as the WWE's fourth Scramble Match, I didn't get into this quite as much as the first three from the ""Unforgiven 2008"" event in Cleveland.  But that's just nitpicking.  Bottom line is that ECW's only match on the card got me into the mood for the rest of the event.
""7.0 / 10""

2) Mask-vs-Title
Chris Jericho (Intercontinental champion)
v. Rey Mysterio (Must Unmask If Defeated)
---If you can forget that Rey was demasked 10 years ago in WCW, then you can get into this match like the rest of us.  Don't you hate it when everyone seems to love a match, and you're wondering, ""What's the big deal?""  Let me assure you, just like everything you read about HBK/Undertaker from ""WrestleMania 25"", this seesaw classic is the real deal.  Jericho and Mysterio play off their previous matches, by adding more counters and twists, just like Rob Van Dam and Jerry Lynn used to do in their ECW contests.  There's really nothing I need to say to persuade you to check this out.  Even if the ""Judgment Day"" or ""Extreme Rules"" showdowns weren't your cup of tea, I beg you to give this one a chance.  If you know what Jericho is capable of, and you know what Mysterio is capable of, then you need to at least YouTube or rent this DVD just to watch this match.  At the time I'm writing this review, we've got a few months before 2010 hits us.  But so far, I haven't seen a better match this year.  Watch it immediately!
""9.0 / 10""

3) No Disqualifications
Dolph Ziggler v. The Great Khali
---This match got its own video package?  O...Kay.  Now, like everyone else who watched ""SmackDown"" leading up to this, I just knew that Kane was going to ruin everything for our beloved Punjabi Giant, giving the cocky Ziggler his 3rd ""win"" over Khali.  However, I had some fun watching this.  There's something about seeing a giant just manhandle the tar out of a smaller jackass that I just love watching.  I mean, come on, don't you like seeing Ziggler pounding and trash talk to Great Khali, only to have Khali's palm smack Ziggler's chest?  I can't believe I'm sticking up for this one, but I have to be honest, and say that Ziggler really worked his tail off to make this fresh.
""6.0 / 10""
___________________________________________

4) Unified Tag Team Championships
Carlito & Primo (champions)
Ted DiBiase & Cody Rhodes v.
v. Edge & Chris Jericho
---Alright, this is one of the crazy things from ""The Bash"" that I won't stick up for.  You see, Edge & Jericho were last-minute additions so that ""SmackDown"" GM Theodore Long could shake things up to keep his job.  That's cool.  But, the whole match basically has the Colons and Legacy duking it out for the gold, as if it was the original advertised match before Y2J & dge were added.  Now, the commentoators and WWE try to spin this as a storyline, because Edge & Jericho do nothing until the very end.  But just because you're letting us in on the joke doesn't make the joke funny.  In fact, the original two-on-two suspense was taken away from me, and I didn't even get to see my two favorite working Canadian wrestlers participate in the action.  What a ripoff!  To be fair, Legacy & The Colons had a decent match together, but I felt just as screwed as they did when Edge got the pinfall.
""5.5 / 10""
___________________________________________

5) Women's Championship
Melina (champion) v. Michelle McCool
---To my surprise, I really enjoyed this match too.  Melina and Michelle McCool are Divas who usually try to throw different things into their performances, the former more high-risk, the latter more technically diverse.  The Sacramento crowd didn't getinto this match much, which is common for women's matches in the WWE.  But I still enjoyed watching McCool and Melina put on their aggressive battle.
""7.0 / 10""
___________________________________________

6) World Heavyweight Championship
CM Punk (champion) v. Jeff Hardy
---One of the highlights of 2009 is definitely going to be CM Punk's slow gradual turn into a villain.  At this point in time, he was merely an opportunist rather than the self-righteous Straightedge Superstar he became.  When it came time for Jeff Hardy to challenge Punk for the gold, they both put on a very good match.  The two men complement each other quite well, especially because Punk seems to show off his skills more than he used to in the past few years.  This man is an ROH veteran, you know.  I also was a bit late to the Jeff Hardy wagon; he really is a reliable and entertaining singles competitor.  This ""Bash"" title bout, like Punk's character turn, takes its time to put the piece together, but doesn't test your patience.  It's just a solid back-and-forth affair.  What'll frustrate some people is the cheap finish in which Punk got himself disqualified.  I say that it's alright to be ticked off once in a while, because we can't have justice 100% of the time.  We'd have no storylines!  The ending helped the storyline and was well-executed.
""7.5 / 10""
___________________________________________

7) John Cena v. The Miz
---Like everybody else who watched this match, I was disappointed to see 4 months of Miz's trash ta,lking result in a glorified 6-minute squash.  I naively hoped that Miz would get to look like a million bucks, and move to the next level.  Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be.  However, just like Ziggler/Khali somehow managed to entertain me, I can't say I was bored.  Sure, if I paid $40 for this PPV, I would've been harsher.  But from the DVD viewing, I guess I'm grateful that it was longer than most squash matches, and admire seeing some unusual offense from both men.
""6.0 / 10"" (most will rate this lower)
___________________________________________

8) 3 Stages of Hell - WWE Championship
Randy Orton (champion) v. Triple H
---Like many hardcore fans, I'm tired of seeing these two work together.  Over the past two years I've seen these guys in a Steel Cage, three Last Man Standing Matches, two title matches in a single night, home invasions, family assaults...what else could they do?  Unfortunately, this 3 Stages of Hell Match probably won't please most people.  It lacks the feeling of a long gurleing battle, like what Steve Austin and HHH put together at ""No Way Out 2001"".  Even the ""Armageddon 2002"" HBK/HHH showdown (overrated in my opinion) had a lot more intensity.  This 3 Stages of Hell Match was entertaining enough for me, but I have a feeling I'm just the forgiving type.  The first two falls end in a matter of minutes; WWE would call it storytelling, I call it time-crunching.  The rest of the match seems to be WWE's new definition of brutality: If both guys are fatigued, it must be a brutal match.  But for a match with the word ""Hell"" in it, this one was a little soft.  But like most other matches on this card, I never got restless, and I somehow enjoyed it.  I like this match, but I won't recommend it to anybody else.
""7.0 / 10""
___________________________________________

""The Bash 2009"" really shouldn't get a positive review like this.  But if I like something, I'm gonna say it, even if there are a lot of conventional reasons why I shouldn't.  ""ECW"" has had a good PPV year so far, and their Championship Scramble was another good match.  It was nice to see ""SmackDown"" stay reliable as the wrestling show, with an incredible IC Title match, and solid Women's & World Heavyweight Championship matches.  Even Khali/Ziggler wasn't too bad in my book.  ""RAW"" is sadly becoming the weakest of the three brands, with barely passable PPV matches like what we saw from this PPV.  It's also too bad that the Unified Tag Team Titles seem doomed to be an afterthought.

I understand why most won't like ""The Bash 2009"", but I bought it on a whim, and I'm glad I did.

8350226,3,B002436WIA,"Championship Scramble ECW Championship Match: Tommy Dreamer (Champion) vs. Christian vs. Finlay vs. Jack Swagger vs. Mark Henry (with Tony Atlas)
I enjoy this kind of match, though Christian and Swagger started out kind of slow since we've seen them wrestle against one another three straight pay-per-views in a row. Finlay and Tommy Dreamer added a lot to the match and made it the most exciting, though Mark Henry didn't do too bad of a job. Towards the end of the match, Dreamer managed to pin Christian following a Dreamer DDT, and then everything just got a bit sloppy, and the lack of any weapon usage was a bit disappointing considering it is technically a No Disqualification Match, but overall, it serves as a good opener and a fairly entertaining and interesting match. Winner: Tommy Dreamer. Match Rating: 4/5

Mask vs. Title Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. Rey Mysterio
Another classic match-up from these two. There was a ton of back-and-forth action, though things started out kind of slow. Jericho whipped Mysterio head-first into the security barricade and then the action went into Jericho's favor as he kept countering all of Mysterio's moves. Mysterio regained the advantage soon enough though, but missed a 619 attempt. Mysterio hit a series of high-impact moves like a tornado DDT though Jericho continuously kicked out. At one point, they both kept rolling each other up, and then Mysterio kicked out of a Lionsault by Jericho. Mysterio powered out of the Walls of Jericho twice, which Jericho applied after countering a hurracanrana, though Jericho countered a springboard crossbody into a Codebreaker. Mysterio STILL kicked out, though when Jericho tried for a Super Codebreaker, Mysterio pushed him off the top turnbuckle and jumped at him. Jericho ripped off his mask, but Mysterio had another mask on underneath! Mysterio hit a running insiguri on Jericho, followed by the 619, and capped off with the Swan Dive to get the victory and the IC title. Winner: Rey Mysterio Match Rating: 5/5

No Disqualification Match: Dolph Ziggler vs. The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh)
Ziggler's pay-per-view debut is a No DQ Match against Khali. Not the best odds I'd say. Regardless, Khali was relentless in his attacks, chopping Ziggler so hard that it made the poor guy fall to the ground. When the fight spilled to the outside when Khali dumped Ziggler over the top turnbuckle, Ziggler dodged a chop that sent Khali's hand SMASHING into the steel ring post. This gave Ziggler the advantage, who hit some pretty unique offensive maneuvers, including a Fameasser, before Khali started getting the advantage again. Ziggler brought a steel chair into the ring and went to attack Khali, but Khali punched it away. Khali chopped Ziggler down and called for the Chokeslam, but then Kane suddenly entered the arena! Kane grabbed a chair and beat Khali down with it, capping off his assault with a chairshot to the skull. This gave Ziggler the opportunity to pin Khali. Not very exciting or amazing, but it was still entertaining with some nice chair shots to see. Winner: Dolph Ziggler. Match Rating: 4/5

Triple Threat Unified WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Carlito and Primo (Champions) vs. Chris Jericho and Edge vs. Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase)
Edge was pissed that he wasn't on the pay-per-view card and Chris Jericho was pissed about losing to Mysterio yet again, so Theodore Long made this match triple threat. While it was hardly a triple threat match, with Jericho and Edge being in the match for mere seconds, it was still a good showing by Carlito, Primo, and Legacy. Primo was grounded for most of the match though, which was a shame and a bad move by the competitors in my opinion. The match got a bit confusing during the end, but what happened was Edge got the pin on Cody Rhodes while Jericho brawled with Primo and DiBiase on the outside. Carlito didn't know that Edge was the legal man and hit the Backstabber, followed by a cover. When Carlito turned around, he ate a Spear from Edge, who then pinned Carlito to win the titles. The ending was confusing and the match wasn't really what it was advertised to have been, but it was still quite entertaining. Winners: Chris Jericho and Edge. Match Rating: 4/5

Women's Championship Match: Michelle McCool (Champion) vs. Melina
This match was okay. There wasn't really anything of note that happened, just some basic women's offense from both competitors, and nothing we haven't seen before. Michelle McCool managed to pick up the win without much of a battle after hitting the Faithbreaker (or whatever it's called nowadays) on Melina to end the ""eh"" match in a particular sweet fashion. Winner: Michelle McCool. Match Rating: 3/5

World Heavyweight Championship Match: CM Punk (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy
This match was actually very well done. Both men hit their usual offense, with Jeff being grounded for part of the match thanks to Punk's submission holds. Punk even pulled out some pretty interesting submissions, including a Figure Four Head Lock (no joke). Hardy hit the Twist of Fate and even the Swanton Bomb, after powering out of the Go To Sleep attempts by CM Punk, but Punk's foot was under the rope, which is a technical rope break. A frustrated Hardy tried to attack Punk some more, but Punk hid behind the referee after a short struggle and then kicked the referee in the side, prompting the ref to call for the disqualification and end the match in a very poor manner. Winner: Jeff Hardy. Match Rating: 4/5

John Cena vs. The Miz
Another bad match from John Cena. Go figure. Anyway, Cena was actually dominated for the majority of the match, with Miz hitting some nice offense moves as well as some high-flying stuff. The match did drag on like crazy during this portion though, with Miz applying very boring submission holds and hitting Cena with basic strikes. In the end, Cena hit the ""Attitude Adjustment"" (yes, they changed the freaking name of the only thing Cena was really good for), and then applied the STF, forcing Miz to submit. Lame match with a lame ending. Winner: John Cena Match Rating: 2/5

Three Stages of Hell WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Triple H
The only real problem with this match is that Triple H and Orton have wrestled a ridiculous amount of times over the last few years and that the match ends up not being what was advertised. Regardless, the match starts out as a regular wrestling match, with some nice offense and signature stuff from both men. However, Triple H nailed Orton in the head with a steel chair out of nowhere to give Orton the win via disqualification for the first fall. This gave Triple H the advantage though during the Falls Count Anywhere Match that followed. Triple H beat up on Orton with the steel chair and then hit a Pedigree on the outside to get the pinfall! The stretcher match was a little more exciting, with brawling all over the arena and some wicked shots into the security barricade and such. Towards the end of the match, Triple H hit the Pedigree to Orton on the steel and nearly had him rolled over the line, but Cody Rhodes ran out! Rhodes prevented Triple H from making it across, but Triple H quickly eliminated Rhodes from the competition. Just when Triple H was about to win again, Ted DiBiase ran out, prevented Triple H from winning, and then he and Rhodes beat up on Triple H. However, Triple H pulled a steel grating off the stage floor and pulled out his sledgehammer! Triple H went to town on Legacy, hitting them with his sledgehammer multiple times, but Orton smacked the steel grating Triple H took off the floor right onto The Game's head. This knocked Triple H unconscious and gave Orton the chance to roll him over the line and retain his title. An angry Triple H then nailed Orton in the face with the sledgehammer after the match. This is a greatly entertaining match with the perfect pace, but there is a serious problem with the lack of brutality here. Winner: Randy Orton Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
The Bash was okay. It wasn't as good as a pay-per-view should be, but it wasn't really disappointing either. The Cena/Miz match was a big letdown, though the main event did deliver, and the rest of the card was pretty good, save for the average women's match. It's not going to win any awards, but it was still an interesting pay-per-view that just fell short of being something you would want to spend your money on without blinking an eye.",1250985600,,8492,4.803693570451436

I havn't seen the other scramble matches so I can't compare but this is was a good way to open the PPV it was action from the start there were a few botched spots but nothing major everyone in the match won the title except for Christian i think they could've finished the match a little better it got very cluttered but overall a good title match
2)Chris Jericho vs Rey Mysterio Intercontinental Title 10/10
This is the match of the night it started out a little slow with Jericho dominating the match but once the match gets going it doesn't stop back and forth action counters galore and plenty of near falls this match will have you on the edge of your seat i liked the ending it was done well another great match in this fued
3)Dolph Ziggler vs Khali 4/10
Yawn...sorry this match is a snorefest but thats what you expect from a Khali match he does his chops and thats about it Khali stands there while Ziggler gets in some offense this match would be totally useless if it wasn't for the return of Kane to start the Kane and Khali fued which didn't work 2 years ago so it im guessing it won't succeed now
4)The Colons vs Legacy vs Edge and Jericho Unified Tag Titles 7/10
The addition of Edge and Jericho didn't really have an effect on this match until the end it's basically just an average Tag Match if Edge and Jericho had been more involved this could've been a match of the night contender but it is funny seeing them begging to be tagged in the match the ultimate opportunist strikes again
5)Melina vs Michelle Mccool Womens Title 5/10
This is another disappointing match Mccool basically dominates this whole match working on Melina's leg Melina gets in a few shots but nothing to shift the momentum you get a little interference from Alisha Fox Mccool makes history after hitting the Faith Breaker AKA The Styles Clash and becomes the first Diva to hold the Divas Title and Womens Title
6)CM Punk vs Jeff Hardy World Title Match 7/10
I was really looking forward to this match but it let me down Punk grounds Hardy with some submissions after Hardy crashes and burns on the outside then Hardy gets disappointed again after the referee reverses his decision when he sees Punk's foot under the rope and restarts the match then Punk gets hit in the eye and purposely kicks the referee to get disqualified bad ending to a mediocre title match
7)John Cena vs The Miz 6/10
Everyone knew who was going to win this match but i was hoping Miz would at least get a chance to show some of his skills and he did for a whole 2 minutes this was a relatively short match which was another disappointment Cena dominates Miz in this squash match and makes him tap like a baby what a shocker
8)Randy Orton vs Triple H WWE Title 3 Stages of Hell 9/10
This is basically just a stretcher match which turned out to be a good thing the first fall lasts about 7 minutes until Triple H gets intentionally DQ'd and destroys Orton with a chair quickly Pedigrees him on the floor to win the second fall the third fall is fought on the floor pretty much the whole time its extremely physical with both guys taking some hard shots with Triple H nearly winning twice the interference from Legacy doesnt hurt the match much because it's short lived Orton hits Triple H with a part of the stage and quickly pushes him across the line before getting blasted with the sledgehammer",1250121600,,3446,4.497607655502392
8350228,3,B002436WIA,"Scramble Match: ECW Champion Tommy Dreamer vs. Christian vs. Finlay vs. Mark Henry vs. Jack Swagger - This was just alright match but nothing about it really stood out to me past Swagger continuing to deliver impressive performances for his ""rookie"" year in WWE.  This picked up towards the end but was easily the weakest ECW Championship match in almost a year & a heavy stepdown from the ECW Scramble match last year.

Mask vs. Title: Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs. Rey Mysterio - The feud of the year (IMO) continues here as they used the motto ""it it ain't broke, don't fix it"" as they used the same formula that's worked before & even had some counters to moves in their previous matches (watch out for that Codebreaker in mid-air).  Just like what this feud was based on, the mask did come into play at one point but it was another creative finish here that again delivered the match of the night.
And as a personal sidenote, I'm glad to see after this 3 PPV match series (4 matches total if you include their final match on SmackDown around a week later) elevate the Intercontinental Championship back to what it's suppost to be since the beginning...the championship that revolves around the ""hardest workers"" in the company.

No Disqualification Match: Great Khali vs. Dolph Ziggler - This was the obivious dud of the night that was only here for two reasons...to setup Dolph as the next challenger for the Intercontinental Championship and the return of Kane but past that, you can easily skip this one.

Unified Tag Team Champions Carlito & Primo vs. Legacy vs. Edge & Chris Jericho - If anyone wants to know how Edge & Jericho got added to the match, pay attention to the backstage skits with Teddy Long all night.  However, don't let the title fool you as this was really the Colons vs. Legacy featuring Edge & Jericho as this was a better match than expected as both teams did have a well worked match & also told a great story in how they kept Edge & Jericho out of the match by avoiding them the whole time to the point where the blind tags in & out between them & Legacy/Colons were almost comedic and their facial expressions for being shutout of the match were almost priceless (no pun intended).  At the most, Edge & Jericho were probably in the ring for less than a minute combined (maybe even less than 30 seconds) but it was actually a good match if you can value the story being told here.

Womens Champion Melina vs. Michelle McCool - This is one of those matches that it's either good or bad depending on what your looking at because this was below the level that I expect from Melina but one of the better McCool matches that I've seen with McCool targeting Melina's leg throughout the match.  This is watchable & not bad but nothing really memorable either past the fact that McCool became the first to hold the Divas & Womens Championship using a move that I've swear I've seen some other guy use on a Thursday night.

World Champion C.M. Punk vs. Jeff Hardy - For two guys who I can't recall ever facing each other before (the Extreme Rules PPV doesn't count), they had a good match as it went back & both match here as both men vibed well against each other here.  I know some are disappointed with the ending but it as a good story told based off the story told throughout the match that Hardy proved he could beat Punk while Punk just couldn't put Hardy down & out while still building to his full ""heel"" turn.  A good match overall.

John Cena vs. The Miz - Flashback to 1998 when Chris Jericho called out Goldberg for months only for it to end with Goldberg kicking the crap out of Jericho very quickly in one forgettable segment & that's it...then fast foward to 2005 when Christian called out John Cena for months only for them to finally have a match where Cena beat him & that's it...now let's jump to today where it was complete ""deja vu"" as Cena out-classed, out-wrestled (with some ""technical"" wrestling if you want to call it that), and quite frankly just completely dominated Miz to the point where when Miz was tapping out, he screaming & acting like he was a 5 year old getting spanked on the butt by his parents.  This was either a comedic squash or a huge burial...depending on how you choose to look at it.

3 Stages Of Hell Match (Regular, Falls Count Anywhere, Stretcher): WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Triple H - This match was just like the Tag Team Title match earler in that you don't let the match ""stipulation"" fool you as this was really just a stretcher match as the first two falls went by really quick & could have been left out because that ended up hurting this match more than helping in the end.  This was your typical Triple H/Orton brawl as it went in the ring, through the crowd, and made it's way onto the stage with a few nice spots with the stretcher with a nice story of Orton focusing on Triple H's bad leg throughout the match.  Overall, just like how their WrestleMania match wasn't a bad match but it wasn't at the level you would & should expect for a WrestleMania main event...this was a good stretcher match but a horrible 2 Out Of 3 falls/3 Stages Of Hell match which was the match advertised.

The only DVD extra here is Tony Atlas trying to cheer up Mark Henry backstage in what I believe is Tony Atlas' last appearence due to Mark Henry going to RAW without him right afterwards.  In the end, this was really just an average but watchable PPV so this is one where you should get it as a rental & make your call because there are some things on here that some people will like that others won't.",1249862400,,5589,4.44574780058651
8350229,2,B002436WIA,"1. ECW Championship Scramble Match: Tommy Dreamer(c) vs Christian vs Jack Swagger vs Mark Henry vs Finlay
All in all, a good match. Lots of action and very exciting! Rating: 4/5

2. Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho(c) vs Rey Mysterio (Mask vs Title)
These two always have a good match and this is really good. In the end, Jericho tried to rip the mask off, but Rey had another mask under it and hit the 619. Rating: 5/5 MATCH OF THE NIGHT!

3. Dolph Ziggler vs The Great Khali
I don't even know why this was on the PPV, worthless match
Rating: 1/5

4. Women's Championship Match: Melina(c) vs Michelle McCool
Just a women's match, nothing special. McCool becomes the first woman to win the Divas Championship and the Womens Championship. Rating: 2.5/5

5. Unified Tag Team Championships: Carlito and Primo(c) vs Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase vs Chris Jericho and Edge
Very surprising! Teddy Long put Jericho and Edge in at he last minute and become the new champions.
Rating: 3/5

6. World Heavyweight Championship Match: CM Punk(c) vs Jeff Hardy
It could've been great, but it wasn't. Punk faked an eye injury and kicked the ref to screw Jeff of winning the title. It was just stupid when the ref said Punk's leg was "" Out of Bounds"" Rating: 3/5 and I'm being nice

7. John Cena vs The Miz
Why would you have this match on a PPV? It lasted not even 10 minutes. It was kinda funny, but that's it.
Rating: 2/5

8. Three Stages of Hell Match for the WWE Championship: Randy Orton(c) vs Triple H
I was really looking forward to this match but it was not great. Triple H had the win but stupid Legacy had to interrupt. Could have been great though. Rating: 3/5

Not a great PPV at all. It's pretty bad when the Intercontinental Championship Match is the best one, hopefully Summerslam will be awesome.",1249257600,,1813,4.556923076923077

Good opener any time you throw 3 or more guys in a match like this it's bound to be a little good B-

Chris Jericho vs Rey Mysterio
These two have had the best matches of 09 and possibly the best feud of 09. This one is no exception another classic match  A-

Great Khali vs Dolph Ziggler
Khali should never wrestle on a PPV it's going to suck no matter what. Ziggler may be a future main eventer but Khali should be gone. Nice to see the return of Kane at the end and Ziggler tried  C+

Carlito & Primo vs Legacy vs Edge & Jericho  C+
Nice addition with Edge and Jericho at the last minute but they had little to no involvment yet won the titles which is stupid and more proof that Vince doesn't and hasn't respected tag team wrestling for a long time.

Melina vs Michelle McCool
Not bad for a women's match but feel both women could do better C+

CM Punk vs Jeff Hardy  B-
Good match here with a cheap ending. They want to do cheap ending on Raw or Smackdown that's one thing but a cheap ending on a PPV??? Stupid Vince. I'm glad Punk is champ though or at least until Night of Champions

John Cena vs Miz
Pointless to have this match on the PPV... Why? Cause the Miz sucks. Miz has no good attributes in the ring at all. No good moves, no strength, no high flying he just flat out sucks and would be better suited as a manager or announcer before a wrestler he's not getting any better but Cena made it somewhat entertaining  C+

Randy Orton vs Triple H
3 Stages of Hell match but I just can't get excited about any match between these two because they are always mediocre. The first two falls were a joke the stretcher portion got better but still nothing special plus ANOTHER cheap ending with Rhodes & Dibiase helping Orton.

The PPV had a few good matches but some bad and pointless ones too but I'll give it 3 out of 5 stars, more like 2.5 but I'll be generous.",1248998400,,1920,4.142857142857143
8350231,4,B002436WIA,"The Bash was an excellent PPV Showing by WWE. I will run down each matches pros and cons.

1. The ECW Scramble Match- Nice Opening contest. Everybody had there moment of glory. Tommy Dreamer retains in a very good match. 4 stars

2. Mask vs. Title Match, Chris Jericho vs. Rey Mysterio. Incredibly Awesome match and a wonderfull effort by both men. It was one of the best matches of the night. Out of their three matches I liked this one the best. *****

3. Dolph Ziggler vs. The Great Khali- I thought that this match was just okay. I liked it when Kane returned though. I like the way that WWE is pushing Dolph Ziggler. I Hope that he becomes a big star because hes cool. ***

4. Unified Tag Team Title Match- Due to pressure from Vince McMahon, Teddy Long made the title match a three tag team title match with the third team being Edge and Jericho. Throught the match Legacy and Carlito and Primo wouldnt tag in Edge and Jericho and neither were legacy. It was a nice swerve by the WWE and there was excellent ring work by both teams. **** 1/2 stars

5. Women's Championship Match- Michelle McCool vs. Melina. I thought this match was excellent for a Women's match. Michelle McCool won after a faith breaker a.k.a Styles Clash. It was a very good showing by both Melina, Michelle McCool, and Alicia Fox who interfered in the match at the very end. ****

6. CM Punk vs. Jeff Hardy for the WHC Championship- Awesome Match. CM Punk should have turned heel over here. Everybody thought Jeff Hardy won but Punk held on to the rope so the ref restarted the match. Punk then kicked the referee in the back and got disqualafied "" unintentionally"". Hardy gets screwed again! ***** ( for the match) -***** for the screwjob

7. John Cena vs. The Miz- Biggest Waste of Time Ever. NEXT! -******

8. Triple H vs. Orton for the WWE Championship- I am incredibly sick of Randy Orton facing Triple H at every WWE PPV event. Its really annoying. This match was a Three Stages of Hell Match. Orton won after Legacy interfered and weakened Triple H enough to put him on a stretcher so Orton could win the match. Pretty good match. ****1/2",1247011200,,2122,4.4370179948586115
