3698456,5,B001MLVKUK,"I just wanted to stress what some others have mentioned. 1. This video is not for beginners.  You should know the basics before you attempt this. 2. The price of this video is well worth the shimmy section alone, and the two performances at the end are an inspiring bonus!!!",1232841600,8,274,4.48
3698457,4,B001MLVKUK,"This is one of the best belly dance practice video on the market. Aziza, a wonderful teacher and dancer, teaches a small group of ladies of different levels, ages and shapes so you can see how the same movement looks on different people. The lesson includes a warm-up, then drills for the arms, the torso, the hips and shimmies. At the end, Aziza's performance is so outstanding that it deserves 5 stars, but I gave the video only 4 stars because I found it a little short and maybe not varied enough considering its promising title ""Ultimate belly dance practice companion"". Maybe a second volume for more advanced students would be a good idea. I am really looking forward to it.",1217462400,,681,4.636363636363637
3698458,5,B001MLVKUK,"I must admit to some hesitation in buying this item.  The reviews are few and the cost is high.  So, based on the few reviews I bought anyhow (thank you reviewers).

I really like this DVD.  I worked out to it for the first time yesterday and the former review about the shimmies is dead on.  I was exhausted and sweating.  You shimmy, shimmy, and shimmy; I'm not sure how much longer it went on cause I gave up after awhile.

So, anyhow the warmup is excellent.  A lot of ballet like terms.  This has been the best bellydancing warm up thus far and I have many dvd's.

Arms, strangely enough not a lot of snake arms, but I wasn't disapointed.  I think the menu break down is introduction, warm up, ribs, arms, hips, and performances.

All in all I loved the dVD I would say it's intermediate but possible for beginners.  Replayability is excellent.  I plan On using this every other day since it is heavy on drills.

My recomendation is it's worth the money.  Better than Michele Joyce.  Her legs are clearly visible.  Visuals and audio are excellent as well.  She is more expensive than others but this is definitly a must buy.",1208131200,2,1129,4.419512195121952
3698459,5,B001MLVKUK,"I just went through this DVD with a friend this weekend and BOY am I sore! If you are looking for a great practice companion DVD, look no further. Great drills that really work your muscles and really work the isolations, and of course her famous shimmy section. She has you spell out the alphabet with your hips while shimmying! I couldn't go that far, by then I was ready to pass out and I was just lucky my hips were still moving at all. I couldn't imagine how much you could improve or polish your skills practicing this DVD regularly.

A must have for all belly dancers! Also, Aziza is so charming and adorable...you'll love her to bits!",1203292800,15,642,4.394957983193278
3698460,4,B001MLVKUK,"Aziza does not actually teach steps or choreography in this video. But as a practice enhancement it is a wonderful addition to my collection. She uses what I would call ballet terms. She doesn't explain some things; she assumes you have some background.  I am in my 20th week of a belly dance class and there were a couple of things I said ""what?"" to. But for the most part a basic understanding is enough.  I find the 'choo choo' a bit challenging. I love the Jumanna (sp?) points for chest and hips. She does the Egyption straight-legged shimmy which I wasn't used to, but my shimmy has improved (I think). She is facing you in the video, several students have their back to you.  When says ""your right"" she is actually using her left. I find that helpful. Overall, I love this view and Aziza is her usual charming self. At the end she performs two dances.",1202428800,6,858,4.417721518987341
3698461,5,B001MLVKUK,"Aziza is such a gem!!!  As someone taking bellydance classes from a teacher, DVD's typically aren't challenging.  This is not the case with this one.  The defining moment for me was the shimmy drills!  Get your water bottle & a towel ready for this part!  Aziza's charm & wit shines through the entire program and her performances are stunning.  This is a must buy for any dancer!!!!!",1198281600,16,384,4.656716417910448
3698462,5,B001MLVKUK,"Aziza' Practice Companion is like nothing else. A self-contained, intense bellydance drill practice and workout, it will make you want to throw all your other dance and exercise DVDs in the closet and just do this everyday. No, really.

First, the basics: the setting is a staged workshop, and you see Aziza over the heads of the participants, as it were. There are online clips of the video in which it seems as though Aziza might be hard to see -- expanded on the larger screen, this is never the case. Aziza mirrors you, calling left as she moves right. The student dancers are a nice effect: while they are skilled enough to keep up with Aziza, they still need her encouragement and correction now and then.

The practice is composed of 6 sections: a warm-up, ribcage drills, hip drills, arm practice, an insanely lengthy, never-give-up, shimmy drill, and finally, a cool down.

The warm-up is thorough, involves a lot of breathing, parallel-foot plies, gentle head movements, bends and arm work, and really does get you ready to practice. (To give you a sense of it, Ava Fleming suggests you do this warmup before using her own DVDs, so it's a keeper.) Posture is covered in detail, but relatively quickly. To jump to the end, the cool-down is even better, involving good leg and back stretches to stretch out the muscles you've just used. Aziza gives posture reminders throughout the program, and is careful to guide your knee placement and to encourage gentle movement of the head for safe exercise.

The ribcage and hip sections include what I find a very fun drill which involves moving the body part in question in six different directions, in a variety of different ways. You really have to use both your back muscles and (especially) your abdominal muscles to keep your posture and do the movement.

The arm section consists of a series of port-de-bras combinations. While still valuable, the arm section is the least unique and innovative part of the DVD. It does, however, have an exercise for learning to move your hands slowly while moving another part of your body quickly. I could imagine this being useful for flamenco dancers as well.

And then there's the shimmy drill. Imagine shimmying. Now imaging shimmying some more. Now imagine doing all sorts of movements with your arms, head, and torso while you shimmy. Now imagine making all sorts of shapes with your hips while you shimmy. Now choo-choo shimmy. Now shoulder shimmy. Oh, now back to normal shimmying, with increased force! Now repeat all the exercises from the ribcage and hip sections while shimmying. After enough time, if you just keep on going, your body enters this zen space where all it knows how to do is shimmy: that's where you start being able to layer things, and you almost don't mind. You think it's about to be over, and then Aziza makes you write the alphabet horizontally with your hips (while shimmying). And then vertically with your ribcage. And then you shimmy some more. And at the end, you find out you were shimmying for twenty minutes, and you can't believe it, because you know you never would even have attempted such a thing if you knew what was in store for you.

In case I haven't made it clear enough, this video is a gem: so is Aziza. She has charm and a sense of humour, and a kind of sadistic gleam in her eye when she's promised one more repetition and says, ""I lied! Another one on your right."" The two performances at the end are just the kind of flirtatious, playful Egyptian style bellydance I love, and it occurred to me as I watched them that trying to imitate those dances would be an entire other workshop! However, this video would really be good for anyone working on their drills, and Aziza's focus on driving the movements with muscles would probably sit well with many tribal or fusion dancers.

After such a glowing review, I almost feel it necessary to say that I don't know Aziza at all. I just think that this video has so much to give to so many different kinds of dancers that it's an unregrettable buy. I tried for a long time to find it used, and now I know why I couldn't: this isn't something you let go.",1196294400,44,4144,4.628571428571429
3698463,4,B001MLVKUK,"Why Amazon always asks me for my view? I may receive many attacks afterwards!

The teacher is a bit on the plump side; she is of the biggest build amongst all my DVD teachers but she is not obese! There are many new things I have learnt from her like moving the arms, wink, and dancing non-stop. She has a very attractive face and smile!

But I have grown through this stage. In comparison to 21 shimmies that I bought at the same time, it is not challenging enough! You can either have it or give it a miss, unlike 21 shimmies, which I would recommend everyone buy it!",1255132800,,569,4.2110091743119265
3698464,4,B001MLVKUK,"Although other reviewers have complained about the unusual presentation (filmed within what seems like a small space, with a multitude of students within arm's reach in front of her), I didn't find it too distracting. It would've been nice if there was at least a mirror behind her, but it didn't strike me as too much worse than being in a class in a small studio. Maybe it's because I was watching it on a 50""-plus t.v., but it wasn't horrible.

Aziza is charming as an instructor and I find her drills thorough and novel compared to others I've encountered in DVDs and live classes.

Nice and complete warm up and cool down.

The drills in particular can be challenging, but it didn't take long for me to feel a payoff as both a cardio workout and as a technical practice. I was also surprised when I realized that the practice is just over an hour, as it didn't feel that long.

I would not recommend it for absolute beginners at all, as she doesn't go into much basic explanation of execution for moves like shimmies (standard hip shimmies or straight-leg) or how to do an omi, for example.

If you've already taken a beginner-level class, however, you should find a good deal of benefit from adding this DVD into your practice repertoire, particularly if you want to learn to layer movements on top of shimmies.",1254096000,3,1317,4.563559322033898
3698465,5,B001MLVKUK,"Aziza is one of the best dancers and performers around.  Her technique is solid, and she is performer with ""soul"".

Many dancer have the technique but lack the 'soul' so they are simply boring after a minute or two.

A must-have!",1253664000,,229,4.536585365853658
3698466,3,B001MLVKUK,"I didn't care for this.

Content:  It's okay.  The pace is very slow, which bored me.  There is a nice section on arms, but everything else just lacks any excitement, and doesn't bring anything that a million other bellydance DVDs don't also offer.

Setting:  Not good.  She's facing a small army of students to are about six inches from her at all times.  Cramped and strange.

I felt this DVD, for me, was not really worth spending money on.  I think it could have been a lot better with different pacing and a better set (and no students!).",1252022400,11,543,4.448979591836735
3698467,5,B001MLVKUK,"I found this drill dvd from Aziza to be a bit more entertaining than most of my drill dvds. Most of us do not have time to complete 65 minutes of anything extra but this has been worth the extra effort. It began with an effective warmup which  lasted for about 11 minutes. Next is 8 minutes of work each for the ribcage, the hips, and arms/hands. Then comes the 20 minute shimmy section which moved very quickly. Finally there is a much needed 10 minute cool down which thoroughly stretches what was worked. My daughter even did this and she typically hates cool-downs!

The class setting was a little confined but not too distracting. I liked how Aziza interacted more with the students and didn't just stare at the camera. She really made the 65 minute drill session 'doable'. Plus I think shimmying out the alphabet with my rib cage and hips were a well worth it pleasant surprise!",1247875200,2,884,4.51875
3698468,5,B001MLVKUK,"Even after several years of dancing, non-boring drilling DVDS are hard to come by. I found Aziza's dvd to be inspiring. This isn't just because she is a great dancer. It is obvious that Aziza enjoys what she does.

There were times in the DVD when Aziza actually noted that certain moves do cause tension on the body. She actually noted how moves should feel on the muscles (and that it may not always feel spectacular). I liked very much that Aziza did not just stand there calling out numbers at the video camera but actually interacted with her students throughout. I felt more like part of the class not just a spectator. This has inspired me (and my daughter) to take a workshop with Aziza very soon.",1247788800,,705,4.5078125
3698469,1,B001MLVKUK,"I don't know why I tried this DVD, I guess it's because I always like to try new things and different artists.  But, I have to say just stick to Suhalia Salimpour and a few others.  The rest aren't even second best.",1242518400,,215,4.095238095238095
3698470,1,B001MLVKUK,"I purchased this dvd from a bazar based on the reviews on amazon, and my disappointment with its content made me write my first review on amazon after being a customer for years:

- The dvd is very much over-priced considering that it is a budget production & second-hand content. Notice how there is always a good review added here when someone has a copy for sale!!

- This dvd is recommended on Aziza's website for ""experienced bellydancers"". But its cover & title doesn't correctly represent the content. It is basically an exercise dvd, the content lacks originality if you are experienced in bellydance and in parts the repetitiveness is boring. It claims to teach ""stationary techniques"", but this is a cover up for the fact that it has been filmed in a small confined space. You can see if students and the teacher tried to move, they would trip over each other. Student' look more novice than experienced. Visually it hasn't got a nice presentation since in parts the teachers movements are obstructed by student's hand & arms.

- Special feature favourite music recommendations: the dvd was advertised for ""experienced dancers"", then your intelligence get insulted when two cds are displayed on the screen. There is no explanation about what type & style of music they are or how they are relevant to the ""stationary techniques"" taught on this dvd.

- Special feature live performance: You get to see more of the back of people's head than Aziza' dance moves. In parts, two third of the screen is covered with the audiences hair & shoulders. Although you can't rate Aziza as high as the likes of Sahra Saeeda and Shareen El Safi, her performances are ok. But on this dvds, Aziza dances as if she has been cornered. There isn't enough room for her to dance her usual style of moving from one side of the stage to the other.

- As for the fan club of ""Aziza is a gem and so is this dvd"", I am sure she is a lovely girl. But if you have studied the Egyptian style of bellydance, then Aziza is good but typical of her type: toned body and nice outfits with good technical display of an acrobatic sequence of movements while the music is being played in the background. Bellydancing is an art, not a ""challenging exercise"" routine (unless one is a couch potato). As for the word ""Ultimate"" in the title of this dvd, you just have to laugh at the arrogance of the person who chose to use it.",1242345600,4,2395,4.56046511627907

3698472,5,B001MLVKUK,"This is a great bellydance drill DVD. Aziza is charming and the drills are well planned. The shimmy drill lives up to its reputation and will give you better shimmy control as you practice it. Don't worry if you don't make it all the way through the first time, just keep practicing. Using this DVD a handful of times has made me more aware of my posture and has improved my dance technique. This is really a must-have for bellydancers.",1241568000,8,436,4.4625

8321491,4,B001MLVKUK,"This DVD consists of technique drills for intermediate and advanced dancers--if you are a beginner or if you are looking to learn choreography, combos, or culture--then this is not for you!  It's filmed with a weird circle of dancers surrounding Aziza--like they could only afford to rent a tiny room to shoot this DVD in.  The quality is not as high as Aziza deserves either. The unique style of this DVD could be a plus to you, though, if you have watched a lot of other dancers' DVDs--it's something new!

Aziza's two stunning performances make up for any shortcomings--she dances with such softness, grace, clever isolations, and JOY!  While belly dancing may seem like it is for men, women are primarily the ones who are spending money on DVDs, lessons, concerts, and costumes--it's nice to see a performer who has superior dance technique and isn't shaped like a pencil.

Aziza's physique is built for shimmying and seems much healthier for women to strive to attain than those dancers that possess a lizard-like slenderness.  I like that the students featured in the video came in all shapes, sizes, and ages.  I was happy to see Roula Said as one of the ""student"" dancers--I took a workshop with her in 2012--she shares Aziza's humor and artistry.  Overall, while this may not showcase Aziza's best talents (her balletic smoothness mixed with sharp isolations, flawless technique and engaging choregraphy!) it's great practice and inspiring.",1371513600,,1449,5.008333333333334
8321492,4,B001MLVKUK,"Aziza is my favorite belly dancer.
just seeing her on the video makes me wanna practice more.
however, that said, the movements are not shown in all angles so it's kinda hard to follow if you're not used to them.
Also her movements have certain flair.. so maybe you want to start with something else if you're an absolute beginner.",1329091200,,331,4.533333333333333
8321493,5,B001MLVKUK,"Aziza is a brilliant dancer with a wide dance back ground.  This is a great daily drill DVD which lets you choose which sections you'd like to concentrate on; It includes a warm up, ribcage isolations, hip isolations, arm work, a fabulous 22 min shimmy drill and a cool down.  Aziza is charming as always and her instruction is very informative.  I would not call this a beginners workout.  It assumes that the student has a basic idea of belly dance movements.  For an intermediate student this DVD is fantastic for working on range of movement as well as fluidity or as Aziza terms it 'pathways to the positions'.  I have found this invaluable in my daily belly dance workout routine and I highly recommend it.",1304294400,,712,4.611111111111111
8321494,4,B001MLVKUK,"I love this video for a great belly dance focused workout. Good warm up, great stretching exercises (though the ""stops"" happen a little quickly), and the ultra killer shimmy drill that will leave you stronger every time you do it. She has a great sense of humor and is upbeat the entire time, which keeps things fun. I barely notice that an entire hour has passed!

This is NOT a learning video - this is a workout/drilling video for those already familiar and/or experienced with belly dance.

Note: At least in my copy, there is a bad edit where she is doing Jumana points on the hips and it skips from one direction (ups I think) to the other (downs I believe) in the blink of an eye. At first I thought I missed something, then I realized it was a bad edit - she starts with ups and jumps to downs! It happens just as you see the camera crew duck around the class in the foreground. Be aware of this, pause the video, finish the ups, do the downs, and unpause.",1274140800,,964,4.262295081967213
8321495,3,B001MLVKUK,"I have had this DVD for 3-4 years now and I think Aziza is an excellent teacher, so I recently found myself wondering why I never use this DVD. I used it three times shortly after I purchased it, but I have not even looked at it since. This is a shame, since the drills are excellent and Aziza has a lot to offer.

First of all, the DVD was shot in a very cramped space packed with a lot of dancers. It is clear that the dancers barely have room to move, and that sense of being ""cramped"" has tainted the whole production.  There is no attractive background to give a sense of spaciousness or atmosphere to the DVD. While this may not sound like an important issue, it seems to have affected the attitude of all of the dancers. Neither Aziza nor her dancers look relaxed or spontaneous in their movements. They look like they are self-consciously rehearsing for a performance.

Secondly, Aziza's ""warm ups"" are essentially stretches, rather than vigorous moves to get the blood pumping and the muscles warmed up. The result is that I still find myself feeling tight when she moves on to the drill section, which calls for a lot of flexibility in the hips and torso.

Lastly, I feel that the drills would be more beneficial AND enjoyable if they were interspersed with some long relaxing stretches and an opportunity to ""lighten up"" and have fun. I am very serious about my own workouts, which I usually do for 1-2 hours per day 6-7 days per week. However, I always appreciate a little bit of humor, inspiration, and/or light-hearted encouragement thrown in on the part of my workout instructors.

The exception to this are those workouts which are so demanding that they require intense concentration, careful attention to form, and very good breathing technique. In those cases, the endorphins start pumping and there is no need for light-hearted banter, since the vigorous workout is so rewarding in and of itself. This set of drills does not feature anything vigorous or heart-pumping, however.

If you are looking for some excellent drills that will help you increase your range of motion, especially in the torso and hips, you may want to consider purchasing this DVD, or you might want to keep shopping. I usually look forward to my daily workouts, but I personally found it impossible to look forward to working with this dry and uninspiring set of drills.",1263772800,3,2363,4.6819277108433734
8321496,5,B001MLVKUK,"This DVD is one that has been in my collection for a long time. I will probably never get rid of it.
It is exactly what the title says, a ""practice companion"". It is meant to help with posture,and polish on the moves that anyone past beginner will know. I use it every once and a while to keep my posture and control in check. It is good for that. However, if you want a "" workout"" or to learn something new, or even to be mentally or visually stimulated,then skip it. This DVD is VERY different from anything else out there, which I think is a good thing.",1263600000,,556,4.110091743119266

Aziza is fantastic as an instructor and I really enjoyed her enthusiasm and teaching style.  They video is definitely what the title says though - you will not be learning new moves or combinations.  This is a drills dvd, but as such it is the best one I have purchased.  It is suitable for an intermediate dancer who is already familiar with the basic moves and is looking to expand range of motion and strength.  As for the way it is shot - it is a little weird at first and I understand why people used the term ""claustrophobic,"" but I actually ended up not completely disliking it.  Since there is no mirror, you get to see her students instead, which gives you a view from the back, and the position of the camera makes it seem like you are actually there in the class, so all in all - definitely a worthwhile purchase!",1262822400,,952,4.2555555555555555
8321498,5,B001MLVKUK,"This is a great, fun, drills workout due to Aziza's great body awareness, fluidity, unrestrained humor, analogies & true love of teaching dance & dancing itself.
Menu chapter choices & 2 performances.  It's set in a room with curtains behind, about 8 students partial bodies you can see. You can see her clearly at all times & it does zoom in on her when needed so you don't see the students. Good camerawork, I never felt irritated that it did/did not zoom in when I wanted. I had no problems with the production. The sound & lighting were great, the added music, even though added after is much better then nothing & actually nice fast beat that keeps you going.

Warm-up - 8 min
Posture - think of your breasts as eyes & keep them wide open ... eggs under your armpits ... piano balanced on your hips. I love her analogies.
Detailed & full head rolls & spots to stretch, shoulder rolls, shoulders/chest open/closed, snake arms w/wide leg stance, side stretches, torso rotations, spine rolls, standing fwd bend w/bending & straight legs.
Ribcage - 9 min
Jumana points - moving only the ribs (not the shoulders!) right fwd corner, side, back right corner, left fwd corner, side, left back corner.
Moving the ribs/torso  to the points, first just pushing/reaching in those directions & back,  scooping upward to those corners, scooping under to those corners, lifting to those corners, dropping to those corners. She also do 4 little locks to those corners which is very tiny & hard to do.
I love this, my torso felt so much looser & more free after doing this.
She always reminds you about your posture just when you need it.
Hips - 9 min
You do the same thing, but this time with the hips, though now they look more familiar as they are like hip bumps/thrusting, hip dropping, hip lifting, half figure 8s, etc. My hips felt looser here as well.
Arms - 8 min
Being more aware of your arms as you open arms, raise arms, arms to the side, 1 arm at a time, arms behind head, 1 hand up as other goes down, adding with a spin, adding wrist circles to the same movements. She reminds you of intention of not just focusing ahead of the pose, but the journey as well which gives the fluidity & body awareness. She adds some you don't see in other beginner bellydance dvds.
Shimmies  - 21 min
You are shimming straight leg ""knees to the back, back back, like your cold, like rubbing your knees together"" this ENTIRE time with only a few short breaks to do shoulder shimmies. She jokes to, ""if you lose your shimmy, start it back up like a lawnmower vaaaarrrroommoomoooommm"" ;-) As you are doing shimmies, she adds various fluid arm movements, arm poses (I love the ones she chooses, it's not the same you always see), shoulder rolls, rib isolations, undulations, hip isolations, choo choos (shimmy on tip toes), hip circles (""I lied, one more time around!""), etc. I did it, though I slowed down a bit here & there & then I couldn't feel my legs!
Cool Down - 11 min
If you can still move...  lunge stretch, reclined knees to chest, single leg stretch, reclined figure 4 stretch, reclined spinal twist, hands/knees cat/cow stretch w/hip circle after, downward facing dog & ends w/standing torso rotation.

During the Jumana (sp?) points the video jumps from doing one type of exercise on the left hip to another exercise on the same hip, thereby cutting out several minutes of workout.  It makes the entire demonstration uneven, so a viewer has to pause the tape and complete the missing exercises before going on.  Otherwise only one hip gets the complete workout.  This is an unprofessional mistake that should have been caught long before the DVD went to distribution.

On the whole, I find the presentation distracting.  A professional teacher uses a mirror, so that both sides of a move can be seen.  The presence of the other students seemed solely to show that she's popular and added nothing to the demonstration.

Also, most of the time there is music playing in the background, but she is not doing the moves to the music.  As a dancer and teacher I find that VERY annoying.  Either use the rhythm of the music playing or turn it off.

Having said that, do I still find the DVD useful?  Yes.  The continuous shimmy is challenging and I find the Jumana points useful in extending my range (with the missing section added).",1258675200,4,1210,4.624413145539906
