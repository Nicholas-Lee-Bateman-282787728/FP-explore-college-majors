8539524,3,B000ZK5SO8,"I'm a fan of vintage instructional / informative films, and this was a bit of a disappointment. This is definitely just a theatrical disaster movie. Maybe it wasn't picked up for distribution and got re-billed as a ""Telephone Equipment Line Repair Film"" to increase profits.
The picture quality was quite bad, so that may be a clue. It's a pretty quirky movie, complete with abrupt marriage proposals at the end, but I don't think it's entertaining enough in any aspect to justify the purchase.",1395273600,,494,4.892857142857143
