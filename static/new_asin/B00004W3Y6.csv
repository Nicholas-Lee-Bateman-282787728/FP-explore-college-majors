The quality of the filming is a very high standard and the video covers different aspects of freediving including diving deep, underwater hockey, spearfishing and recreation. The shots of monofinning with dolphins was great. A good overview and very encouraging to get in the water. Certainly a joy to watch and encourage anyone who is interested in this sport.

This is NTSC but I had no problems playing on a multistandard domestic video and TV.",1126915200,,477,4.9625
8602562,4,B00004W3Y6,"This video is what got me started freediving. It is filled with exciting  activities that make up the wonderful world of freediving. Even if you have  no interest in ever freediving you will still enjoy this show. Terry Maas,  Champion freediver introduces you to a world beneath the sea without the  ecumbrance of scuba tanks. Beautiful underwater footage of whales, dolphins  and other creatures. Other shows to watch in relation are: Freediving Made  Easy and Blue Water Hunters - narrated by Peter Fonda.",964569600,2,508,5.0602409638554215
