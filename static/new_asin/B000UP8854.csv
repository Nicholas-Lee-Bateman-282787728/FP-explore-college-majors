2923600,4,B000UP8854,"When watching and listening to these songs covered by some very competent musos, you soon realise how great that Capaldi-Winwood collaboration was.
It is a pity that ""Coloured Rain"" and ""Smiling Phases"" weren't included.
Nevetheless, a great buy.",1222819200,4,246,5.5
2923601,5,B000UP8854,"Astounding the number of friends that Jim Capaldi had, all the way from new wave (Paul Weller, who jumpstarts the show with ""Paper Sun"") to a guy from that forgotten-but-not-quite-gone/Shel Silverstein vehicle group, Dr. Hook, Dennis Locorriere, Eagle Joe Walsh, Bill Wyman of the Stones, Jon Lord of Deep Purple, Wix Wickens of Paul McCartney's newest band, Pete Townshend of the Who - and of course, Steve Winwood.  Winwood's newest ""Traffic Incarnation"" here is, for my money, the very best I've seen since the original Winwood/Capaldi/Wood/Mason(?) edition (and that includes that 90's thing). Mark Rivera of Ringo's band does a SPLENDID job as musical director here and as a musician, he is easily about 100 times superior to that guy who had the temerity to fill the ""faux Chris Wood/wind instrument"" role on the aforementioned ""Traffic Reunion"" tour.  Just one slight quibble, really, he shouldn't been one of the three voices (the other 2 being Winwood and Joe Walsh) on the show's closer, the sublime ""Love Will Keep Us Alive.""  I don't know who the guitarist of the ""house band,"" was, but I do believe he'll go to Heaven for his handling of the guitar solo on ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" - THAT, as part of the same song, drummer Simon ""Free/Bad Company"" Kirke's performance of ""Whale Meat Again.""  Kirke absolutely steals the show out from under everybody else (watch the DVD and see if you don't agree).  The only thing that mars this tribute is the presence of Elton Jann's screamingly moronic, over-reactive ""percussionist,"" Ray Cooper, who  cannot even whack a triagle or tambourine without pulling the stupidist faces or gesticulating like he's having a seizure; he almost ruined that multiple sclerosis/Tribute for Faces bassist Ronnie Lane-thing back in 1983, by doing the same thing.  Regardless - this is THE music DVD to purchase in 2008 - and, believe me, that most assuredly and ESPECIALLY includes ""Shine A Light,"" the movie that made people ask ""oh, are the Stones still together?""
Subsequently: I griped about Ray Cooper, surely one of the greatest wastes of oxygen imaginable.  But I was raving about this DVD to my guitar player, and he remarked, ""Yeah...I was curious about it; but then I saw were Yusef Islam was a part of it - and now I won't touch the thing!  Amen to that.  I have to flick the ""fast-forward"" thing whenever Yusef sticks this carcass into this thing - but them so for ""the Storys,"" who flagrantly ripped their name off from ""Brother Louis,"" Ian Lloyd and the Stories.  The backup singers solo sets are eh.......but it's all worth it for Steve Winwood's set, and Joe Walsh doing ""John Barleycorn.""  Try it and see -",1218153600,2,2666,4.873893805309734
2923602,5,B000UP8854,"A very strong tribute concert in honor of the late Jim Capaldi's time with Traffic and as a strong solo artist.
I agree that I wish Steve Winwood spent more time on stage, as well as Pete Townshend (Townshend couldn't rehearse with the all-star band because of The Who's ""Endless Wire"" tour, but turns in a stunning solo piece, ""No Name, No Face, No Number."" A great take.
Nice to see Bill Wyman on stage again, for a couple tunes, and Simon Kirke's voice and drumming are another  highlight. Love Paul Weller, too.
Proceeds from this DVD and the CD of the same show go toward a benefit in Capaldi's name - his widow, Anna Capaldi, has an orphanage for children that takes care of youngsters in need of medical help, food and love.
I strongly recomend this DVD to all fans of rock, Traffic, Jim Capaldi, Winwood, The Who and all of the other artists who participated. It'll help out children in need, and it will honor the late, great Jim Capaldi.  Thanks.",1197936000,22,956,4.488505747126437
2923603,3,B000UP8854,"This isn't a Traffic concert, but a tribute to Jim Capaldi. I too would have liked to see Steve Winwood on stage more, and with a little less artsy band. However everyone turns in good performances. Sure this is sort of like the typical house band plus guests type thing, but Paul Weller in particular turns in several good performances. If you don't have the Last Traffic Jam, by all means buy it first, but then come back and buy this. In addition to a few Traffic songs, you also get some of his best solo tunes, too.

Jim Capaldi was a really good musician and will surely be missed.",1195603200,6,587,4.336363636363636
2923604,1,B000UP8854,"This may have been a good concert to have attended, but overall the music was below par for the fans of Traffic. In my humble opinion, Steve Winwood should have spent much more time on stage. John Barleycorn in particular suffered from not having Steve Winwood sing and play guitar. So, unless you are a hardcore fan, save your money and use it to purchase The Last Traffic Jam instead.",1193184000,5,386,4.5285714285714285
2923605,5,B000UP8854,"This is one of the best rock concerts I have ever seen,these guys jam. The audio as well as the video are top of the line.",1192579200,4,122,3.730769230769231
8214196,5,B000UP8854,A great recording that was very well put together. Many musicians appeared to dedicate this show to Jim Capaldi and his family. I would highly recommend this DVD to all Traffic and or Jim Capaldi fans.,1388620800,,201,4.611111111111111

8214198,5,B000UP8854,This is a wonderful tribute with a long list of wonderful guest some are Steve winwood. Gary Moore. Jon lord. Cat Stevens. Joe Walsh. And a aperence by Jim. Capaldis brother. I loved the Gary Moore version of evil love and Steve winwood Joe Walsh and the.band do love will keep us alive. This is a awesome disk of rock legends honoring one of the own. Its in DTS. Dolby 5.1. Dolby 2.0. If you are a traffic of Jim capaldi fan or if you love great rock in roll music this is highly recommended A Rock in roll DVD collection is not complete without this wonderful disk,1368316800,,566,4.25
8214199,5,B000UP8854,"For me, while I have a couple of Jim Capaldi LP's, the focus Traffic-wise has always been on Steve Winwood.  This tremendous video helps me rethink that - not to detract at all from SW, but to INCREASE my understanding and appreciation of JC's contributions and personal values.  One could find fault with the individual perfs, but overall I would highly recommend this to any Traffic-JC fan.  Side note:  the percussionist Ray Cooper, seemingly ubiquitous on Brit concert videos, is here as well.  I don't think I have ever seen anyone have as much pure fun while performing!!  This guys really PLAYS his instruments....he always makes me smile.",1304467200,,646,4.935185185185185
8214200,5,B000UP8854,"This is a great dvd of an excellent concert, put together by Jim Capaldi's widow
Aninha. Musicians include Stevie Winwood, Pete Townsend, Joe Walsh, Bill Wyman, Jon
Lord, and Yusuf Islam. As well as the band: Mark Rivera, Ray Cooper, Simon Kirke,
Andy Newmark, Pete Bonas, Wix Wickens, and Dave Bronze-with Dennis Locorriere,
Stevie Lange, and Margo Buchanan adding some great vocals!

The arrangements of Jim Capaldi's tunes are excellent: Well-rehearsed and tight!
The camera is always where it should be, and the lighting and minimal effects
(combined with interesting camera work) make for great viewing as well.

For anyone who was/is a Traffic fan, or just loves laid back Classic Rock, this dvd
is really a must! I've already sent 2 to friends, and am preparing to order 2 more.",1283212800,,785,4.984732824427481
8214201,5,B000UP8854,"The Dear Mr Fantasy tribute to Jim Capaldi is one I happened on by sheer accident for under five dollars in a bargain bin at San Diego's Sam Goody music store. Fully aware that a lot of tributes are pure crap, I took a chance on this after seeing the all-star lineup and after some goading from a friend who bought the other copy that was in the bin.
Well, what a find! In the more than two hours of music you get, there are a whole lot of excellent Capaldi/Traffic covers and nothing at all that is unlistenable. Fans of Traffic who are unfamiliar with Capaldi's solo work will find a lot to delight them and that rare fan of Capaldi's solo work who is blissfully unaware of his work with Traffic should achieve the same level of musical satisfaction.
I could go on and on but I won't. Here are what I think are the highlights: Paper Sun, which aptly features Paul Weller as the song is so very Welleresque; Living on the Outside which features Joe Walsh, Bill Wyman and Jon Lord; Elixir of Life featuring Dennis Locorriere; Whale Meat Again, which features Simon Kirke; Joe Walsh's stormy assault on Forty Thousand Headmen; Yusuf Islam's plangent cover of Man With No Country; a tasty take of the title cut featuring Steve Winwood; the bluesy Evil Love featuring Gary Moore that I think is the DVD's best cut; a convincing John Barleycorn Must Die that features Joe Walsh; and the funky Rock and Roll Stew that features Dennis Locorriere, Margo Buchanan and Stevie Lange.
This flaming bargain comes with an attractive booklet packed with pictures, DVD info, the story of Traffic, and various tributes to Jim Capaldi from some of the key participants in the concert. If you are a fan of Traffic or of Capaldi on any level, then you should pick this DVD up soon. This is one tribute that does justice to the music of its subject.",1267401600,3,1829,4.5120481927710845
8214202,5,B000UP8854,"I bought this  DVD to see more of Steve Windwood. Instead, I got introduced to the genius of Jim Capaldi's music, and also to Gary Moore. Anyone who has never seen Gary Moore play Jim Capaldi's""Evil Love"" will be amazed and never forget it. That song and performance is in the top ten performances of all time in my opinion. I think that the only place to see it and hear it is on this video. Well worth the investment.",1265414400,,419,4.2375
8214203,5,B000UP8854,"Very impressive CD.
Traffic played at the first 'big' concert that I ever attended.
Capaldi was one of those majical musicians who are sorely missed.
Great music!",1240185600,,162,5.037037037037037
8214204,3,B000UP8854,"Just touching on the highlights, for me they were Paul Weller and house band performing a spectacular rendition of Paper Sun. The band and Paul hit all the nuance of the song, probably Jim and Traffic's finest moment.
Simon Kirk sings very nicely Whale Meat Again.
Joe Walsh, with Jon Lord on Hammond and Bill Wyman, bass, do 40,000 Headmen and John Barleycorn Must Die. Joe straining just a little with age to hit all them high notes pretty successfully.
But the most surprising highlight of this disc, one I did not anticipate at all is the appearance of the former Cat Stevens. After a very warm introduction to the song Man Without A Country I was very pleased that Cat/Yusef has not lost any range or delicacy in his singing. One of the last of the old guard that still sounds like his younger self. This performance made me a fan of this song of which I knew nothing prior.
And then Gary Moore, of whom I knew basically nothing other than name recognition. Turns out Gary sings with a very strong, gutsy voice and is easily one of the best guitarists today. After hearing Gary sing here,I'd love to hear the original version by Jim. Oh one small note....I couldn't help think of Dean Wareham who's book I had read recently in which he admits to frowning upon guitarists who make the ""guitar face"" when playing. Gary Moore and Joe Walsh are good examples of this.
Weller returns with a rendition of the little heard Traffic single ""Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush""-just delightful! I'm so glad he chose to do this song, it's a real treat. And the version Paul and the house band perform is spectacular. Definately a highlight. Well, that's why I'm mentioning it here now isn't it-because it was one of the highlights of this disc for me!
Pete Townsend's appearance is just him and his acoustic guitar singing ""No Face No Name No Number"" which is a beautiful song as done originally on the first Traffic album. Pete takes a valiant stab at the song but it just made me yearn to hear the original again.
Jim's brother Phil came out on stage looking rather like a cabbie or a dishwasher perhaps but I have to tell you, Phil sang really good with loads of feeling and professionalism. And the fact that this is Jim's brother permeated the atmoshphere like no other performer there that night could bring. A definate highlight.",1234483200,,2330,4.563245823389021
8214205,5,B000UP8854,"This is not only a salute to the brilliance of the late Jim Capaldi; it is a wonderful look at artists who truly believe that music can deliver special meaning for the young who are in need. The concert was held in January 2007 and covers the solo and Traffic careers of Capaldi, while raising funds for The Landmark Trust, a children's charity.

There is an incredible list of performers - including Paul Weller, Joe Walsh, Pete Townshend, Steve Winwood, Jon Lord, Gary Moore, Simon Kirke and Yusuf Islam - and each are given the space to shine. Truly, any egos are left at the door.

Capaldi was an artful lyricist, but is a vastly underrated drummer, who skillfully brought jazz elements to the British music scene. This is classic rock that is truly ""classic.""",1229817600,11,764,4.651851851851852
