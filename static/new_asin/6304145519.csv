7862573,4,6304145519,"Let's get one thing straight: even though I've given this movie four stars and declare it a good film for star Jeff Speakman, it is definitely *not* the Jeff Speakman film I would like to see.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Weapon/dp/B006A8XFUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Weapon</a>&nbsp;is Speakman's curse, being a high standard to judge the rest of an otherwise uneven solo career by. Martial arts fans want tons of cool karate fights from the man who popularized kenpo on the movie screen, and even though this isn't exactly what you get in ""Deadly Outbreak,"" it's still a good action-adventure.

The story: a terrorist group led by a murderous colonel (Ron Silver,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timecop/dp/0783225520/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timecop</a>) infiltrates an Israeli chemical plant to steal a devastating weapon, and the only man who can stop them is an ex-Special Forces embassy guard (Speakman).

Given that the movie was produced by the relatively young Nu Image company, one might assume that this film was never destined for a theatrical release, but that doesn't keep it from being Speakman's largest-scaled movie at that time. Like Steven Seagal in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege/dp/0790732238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege</a>, Speakman graduates from the grittier and more personalized street violence of his previous fare for a wider range of action and the big-budget feel. And like that Seagal vehicle, ""Deadly Outbreak"" is a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;rip-off, albeit one even more packed with action movie clichs. The formulaic screenplay pales in comparison to Hollywood's output of the same time, but in often undersourced the DTV market, this was/is pretty fulfilling.

...Though not necessarily when it comes to acting. Speakman and his sidekick/love interest Rochelle Swanson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Games-3/dp/6304810857/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Games 3</a>) snipe at each other as a matter of course for the palpable (and completely unfounded) sexual tension between them, and having their characters written this way doesn't let either of them act all that well. Ron Silver plays a villain so obvious that it's amazing anyone is duped by his halfhearted I'm-a-doctor charade, but his hamminess is enjoyable. The various henchmen are fun to watch on the same terms; my favorite is Kevin Jones, who speaks with a heavy accent but still drops American slang. I was pleased that, despite all the cheesiness, the movie seems slightly self-aware at times, like when Speakman's hero dives behind some flammable drums during a gunfight and sarcastically declares ""Good choice of cover!""

Speaking of gunfights, the action content here is pretty fulfilling, if not in the way that karate fans are hoping for. Jeff's first fight scene - against two thugs in a bathroom - is good enough to get your hopes up, but the next four merely remain level, entertaining casual viewers (especially the knife fight) though not necessarily impressing anyone who's seen Speakman at his best. The shootouts are ample and, thankfully, a step above the average: they definitely weren't filmed by John Woo, but director Rick Avery has a knack for pacing gunfights better than you'd expect even in most Hollywood features. Later, Speakman gets attacked by a wheel loader, surfs a speeding bus, and somehow manages a car chase in the tightest tunnel imaginable. You can definitely find worse varieties of solid action.

Clearly, this is the movie that Jeff chose to expand as an action hero beyond his ""kenpo guy"" image. There isn't a fan alive who doesn't wish he had remained with it, but this still a fun flick and allowed Speakman to hold his own in the DTV market. After this film, Speakman would assume more supporting roles than not and arguably never recaptured a high action standard, so in a way, this one's his last hurrah as a stellar action hero. Everyone from general action fans to worshipers should give this a look.",1406592000,,4299,5.92741935483871

7862575,2,6304145519,"Imagine a hybrid of ""Die Hard"" and ""Outbreak"" and you'll have some idea what to expect from ""Deadly Outbreak,"" a formulaic action flick that has martial-arts star Jeff Speakman filling in for Bruce Willis as the right man in the wrong place at the right time. Only undemanding genre fans will care.
 Speakman plays Dutton Hatfield, a Special Operations officer assigned to the U.S. embassy in Israel. He goes along for the ride when some visiting American VIPs visit a chemical-weapons research center. Unfortunately, the VIPs are impostors. Led by a former military official (Ron Silver), they take over the center to gain control of something breathlessly described as ""possibly the most deadly chemical warfare agent ever designed."" But even though they are heavily armed and highly trained, they are no match for our resourceful hero.
 Under the uninspired direction of  Rick Avery, ""Deadly Outbreak"" quickly devolves into a series of predictable cat-and-rat encounters, as the increasingly frustrated Silver repeatedly sends his flunkies out to kill the indestructible Speakman. Occasionally, Speakman tries to bring a touch of tongue-in-cheek humor to the repetitious proceedings. (When some goons try to rape scientist Rochelle Swanson, he shouts: ""Hey! That's not practicing safe sex!"") But Speakman seems much more comfortable when he is kicking butts or cracking heads.
 For most of the movie, Silver is reduced to sitting behind a desk, glowering at his underlings, and purring commands like, ""Would you be kind enough to go up to the second floor and bring me Hatfield's head?"" Later, he drops all pretense of being polite, and snarls: ""Gallo, bring me Hatfield's head!"" It comes as absolutely no surprise that, despite the best efforts of the bad guys, our hero's head remains firmly attached to his neck.",986860800,6,1818,5.237113402061856
