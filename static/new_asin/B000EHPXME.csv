8324117,5,B000EHPXME,Ras malai is my idea of going to heaven and I love all the others on this video. I cheat and use ricotta cheese hung in the frig to start getting the water out and then squeezing in a cloth. I have had a rosetta maker for years - often found at midwest fairs or lots of cooking sites. For those who already have aebleskiver pans you will have no trouble duplicating that Indian cast iron pan with wells. Lots of recipes to try and at a great price. There are recipes on the Web but no professionals from India videos that do what this one does so well.,1193270400,2,552,4.073394495412844
8324118,5,B000EHPXME,I have a terrible sweet tooth. I just love Indian sweets but they are so expensive when I used to get them at Sukhadias or Madhuram. I tried to make them by reading the books but it was a frustrating experience. I accidently stumbled on this video and I felt so happy when I made my own chum chum and rasagula for the frist time. This video has almost 20 different sweets being demonstrated by Indian chefs. Great presentation. Waiting for their second volume.,1142553600,9,460,4.488095238095238
