8495463,1,B0069RLBF6,"The DVD arrived promptly, however the disk will not play in my player, the format must have been recorded in a manner that is not compatible with US players.  It is useless unless I want to change the setting on my laptop and watch them that way, which I don't.  I prefer watching on my flat screen TV.  Very disappointed!",1349827200,6,322,4.333333333333333
8495464,5,B0069RLBF6,"I am so glad I bought a dvd player that can play dvd""s from all over the world. It was not expensive and well worth the money. I would not have this season nor season 8 if not for sellers outside of the US. I am enjoying season seven. As  season 6 the picture quality is not as good as some seasons, but acceptable. A few new actors. So glad Dex is still with cast. Same cat fights and lots of new plots. Well worth it.",1349395200,7,419,3.872093023255814
