3563197,2,B001F2JVSO,"I was really excited to recieve this video, but it really falls short.  I danced my entire life and still found this to be hard to follow. The way the video is set up is there's an instructional section that runs through the eight combinations. She does this without ever doing any of the combos to music (which for me actually cements the routine). Once she runs through the combo (once slow, once up to speed facing forward and once up to speed facing backward) she moves on to the next one. She does this eight times in a row. By the third combo, I have NO idea what the first two were, let alone the five to come. From here, you go straight to the cardio dance, wherein she says NOTHING, except for 5-6-7-8 at the begining. She doesn't talk at all through the routine, including to tell you which combo you're actually on.  This is a big disappointment.",1222646400,83,857,4.35
3563198,5,B001F2JVSO,"I loved Tracy's last DVD cardio workout and this one is great too.  I love how you can follow her from the back.  I am not a trained dancer but anyone that puts in the time and effort can learn this.  You just have to keep trying.  Just like you can't expect to lose weight or get in shape by sitting on your butt all day.  Everything worthwhile takes hard work!!  That being said, anyone willing to work hard will love this video.  It is loads of fun and kicks your butt!!!!!",1222646400,2,476,4.108695652173913
3563199,5,B001F2JVSO,"Great workout.  Easy to follow routine, even for the uncoordinated.  Worth the money!",1222560000,,85,5.461538461538462
3563200,5,B001F2JVSO,"I don't think this or the mat dvd is over-rated at all! It is definitely a hard work out, it is a little difficult to follow but once you do it a few times, its very manageable. Its the same with learning anything new, ""some people"" just don't have the patience and when they don't learn something right away they give up! Once you get the basics of the dances, and do it frequently you do begin to see great results! But you do have to work at it! As long as you are consistent, you will feel the burn in all the necessary places. All in all, I am going to give this DVD 5 stars because, it works out every part of your body, and if you keep with it you are going to be very pleased with the effort you put into it. And I DO NOT have any dance background, just a dedication to keep myself happy and healthy! Hope this helps.",1222560000,3,825,3.9759036144578315
3563201,2,B001F2JVSO,"this is so over-rated!  Unless you are a trained dancer, this workout is impossible to follow.  Even after the long instructional section, I found it extremely hard to keep up with.",1222473600,5,181,4.806451612903226
3563202,4,B001F2JVSO,"I love tracy's workouts! I come from a running background and there are days where I just don't want to do it. But with tracy, I feel like a teenager again, dancing in my bedroom (before I knew I was even working out!) My only gripe is that her first DVD was perfect in terms of teaching the dance styles. It gave you a breakdown of the dance, and she actually went over it a few times, then you got to dance it to the music, then it took you to the second combination. On this DVD she takes you through the first combination, then the second, etc... You don't get to dance them til the end and by then you've already forgotten  the first 6 combinations. I wish she would have structered this DVD the same way. HOwever, once you learn the dances, you are going to love it!! Dont expect to do this workout on the first day (unless you have 4 hours to learn the whole thing.)one other thing I loved about this DVD is that she has an option to dance with her facing you OR facing her back(which makes it soooo much easier to do the dances!!) Brilliant!!!This workout is high impact, but you do not need a big space do dance in. Enjoy!!",1222473600,8,1132,4.168949771689498
3563203,5,B001F2JVSO,Just wondering...Do I need a lot of area to do this routine? I live in a tiny apartment.,1221696000,5,88,3.9444444444444446
3563204,4,B001F2JVSO,"This workout is definitely doable, even if you don't have a dance background.  I just got this DVD today and learned the 1st combination up to tempo in 30 minutes - I'm just giving myself plenty of time to learn the routine.  I'm wondering if I have the same DVD as the other reviewer - there is an instructional segment, but my video only has 5 combinations that Tracy uses in a 45-minute workout.  There are no back-up dancers that I have seen.

So far, I love it.  It is just not a tape that you can pop in and go for it.  You have to learn the dance sequence by sequence before you can even attempt the full 45-minute workout.",1221609600,35,630,4.1652892561983474
3563215,1,B001F2JVSO,"Just a lot of jumping around.  Not fun, not easy to follow. I am a dancer, so I can usually pick up routines easily.  Not this time. More frustrating than anything.  Not effective as a workout.",1473033600,,193,4.305555555555555
3563216,2,B001F2JVSO,"Every time I try a new dance exercise class, I'm always astounded that instructors do not understand the basics of how people learn by watching. It's understandable that, in a class setting, instructors have to start each class by not boring those who have attended before, but in a video like this, I'm sorry, but there is simply NO EXCUSE for getting it right.

First, do NOT start a demonstration by facing the audience because that means that you are showing us a mirror image. ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, start by turning your back to us so that we can imitate what are you doing EXACTLY.

Second, do the first sequence of steps VERY, VERY, VERY slowly. Then do them again and again and again and again, until we master that sequence. THEN AND ONLY THEN can you go on to the next sequence.

For now, I'm throwing this DVD in the trash and going to search for an instructor who can teach properly",1472515200,,896,4.484662576687117

3563220,5,B001F2JVSO,"Just got this, so I'll maybe try posting again after I've done the workout for a few weeks, but so far, I LOVE IT!  Main reason is, she doesn't yap away.  She just dances, which means you keep moving and get a better workout.  Yes, the choreography is very hard to follow.  But I never focus on whether I'm getting the steps exactly right in any dance workout anyway.  The point is to move and to keep moving throughout!  Just keep moving, and try to keep up without getting frustrated.  As long as you are up, jumping, on your toes, grooving, who cares whether you get it right?  I guess for me, it's fun to try and keep up with her and to just let the music take me.  If you're someone who gets very frustrated about being able to follow every step, I'd say this isn't for you.  But if you like to shake it up, and don't worry too much about whether you're getting everything perfect, you'll have a lot of fun and be sweating in no time!!!",1453075200,3,941,4.177777777777778

Definitely has me intrigued for more Anderson workout dvds but not until I master my first. Lots of hopping, jumping, kicks and turns, keeps your hands up in the air.

3563236,1,B001F2JVSO,I have an extensive collection of fitness DVDs and have done 20+ years of gym classes as well as home workouts and this one would have to be the HARDEST to follow and I gave up after 35mins. I was so confused and lost and found it really didn't give enough instruction or practice and when she did the steps in the performance which you were meant to follow it was done differently to how it was taught and in the opposite direction! Will not be doing it again!,1425686400,,461,4.191011235955056

3563243,5,B001F2JVSO,"I ordered this a couple of weeks ago and am very pleased with the purchase thus far. These dances are just enough challenge and cardio workout I have been so craving for. I am not a beginner and was looking for something that would further advance my development. This is fun (I love dancing) and strenuous enough to give me a good workout! I read about this system in Self magazine, decided to try and am loving it. At first I thought I would do one dance at a time, but now I think I will learn them all just like the DVD plays them and then will be performing them from memory. I also found great DJ mix that has the same rithm to match Tracy's in the video, I just use that and follow her lead.",1414886400,,698,4.065217391304348
3563244,5,B001F2JVSO,"I am currently still using her other DVD's (beginner - which is GREAT ) and precision. Those are my favorites.. This one is still a bit advanced for me... so I've tried once, and will have to try again, in small bits...  This one is for those who are really familiar with her style and the body positions, and can remember things really well, without much instruction...

Her other products really work - (i've reviewed them, if you want to look).. I have an extensive background in exercise / fitness.. and her method takes the best of ""dance"" (which originated from Kung Fu, etc..) and other ""qi"" energy - deep inner work - type fitness - ancient methods, and takes them to a ""modern"" level for us...

It's great!  VERY Different, if you are used to the ""western"" (fast, more, heavy... utilize and isolate large muscles... )...  it works ones own body - and energy to get the most of ALL the bodies muscles, the deep inner baby ones, that are often never used...

Her style of teaching is also unlike most ""fitness"" DVD's...

The results are that I feel great, am comfortable in my own body, and learning so much more about my body than ever before, by challenging myself to do her programs...  little by little",1414108800,3,1213,4.532110091743119
3563245,4,B001F2JVSO,"Did this workout several years ago after my first child, and just came back to it again after my second. It's still a great workout.

In case you have weaker knees (like me), I did the routines out of order to accommodate for that (reason for the four star review instead of five). I found #4 and #6 to be the hardest on my knees, so I started with 4-8 and then finished with 1-3. My most favorite is #8 because I love the fast pace, and it feels more dance-y than jumpy.

If you are not sure about doing this or TA's Metamorphosis, start with this one if you are new to TA. The cardio in Metamorphosis might bring down your morale and cause you to stop doing TA altogether. But trust her and stick with this one - she will get you results.",1413763200,,740,4.096551724137931
3563246,5,B001F2JVSO,"This is a great fat burning workout. The moves hard to follow? Not if you do them five days a week they're not! I just pranced around for the first two weeks. I didn't care I was still burning fat and losing weight. By the end of the month I was a pro. However, if you don't like high energy dance, don't get this workout - it's hardcore.",1412553600,,338,3.985294117647059
3563247,5,B001F2JVSO,"Yes - this is definitely an advanced cardio workout.  The way the actual workout goes is like this: there are eight different songs.  The video and and music fades out and back in between each.  I was actually pleasantly surprised about that, because the way people were whining, I thought the workout was going to progressively turn into one long, complicated choreographed dance.  Not so - each song has its exclusive little choreographed bit, which you repeat over and over until the song/section ends.  I can see how this workout would be extremely frustrating for people who are not coordinated and cannot move quickly - the music is very fast and there are a lot of little fleet-footed steps in the routines.  Lots of jumping and leg kicks. There is a chapter where Tracy slowly teaches you each dance.  I didn't have all the time to spend learning each one, so after viewing the first one a couple times only half paying attention, I figured I would just go for it.  I currently dance and have a dance background after all.  I used the back view of Tracy - I don't think I did half bad, actually.  If you're a dancer worth your salt, you can pick up on the routine by the third or fourth repetition out of however many she does during the song.  Besides, even if you do a so-so imitation, you will still be dripping sweat and gasping for breath by the third song (unless you are a serious cardiovascular performer, in which case I bow down to you).  All in all I'm glad to have such a challenging DVD in my repertoire.",1412035200,4,1525,4.465703971119134

I would never buy one of her cd's again.  I ordered some of Gilad's and Leslie Sansone walk hits dvds, and I'm totally satisfied.  Great motivation and workout.  P.S.

3563256,5,B001F2JVSO,I have used this with the Glutecentric muscular structure workouts and lost 5 lbs and a half inch in 30 days (I only had 10 to lose and the last are the hardest). These are dance combinations with instruction from the front and back so you can mirror the movement.  I am not a dancer but I just jumped in and got the hang of it after watching the instruction twice.  This method depends on mind body connection and muscle balance and confusion so you just have to accept that.  The point is not to simply combinations - there is more going on here if you are familiar with TA's toning workouts.  I was sore and off balance the first 10 times I did this sequence and hadn't done any impact exercise for years (just barre and Pilates). Now I actually crave doing this (crazy) and am so strong from it. Totally sold.,1402531200,7,813,4.294117647058823
3563257,5,B001F2JVSO,"I am giving this dvd 5 stars, because despite its flaws, I am seeing excellent results and it is Fun.
I have 4 of the ""mat"" style tracy Anderson DVDs, absolutely love them, and decided to add in her cardio dvd to my rotation.  (I should also mention that I am a 54 y.o. avid home exerciser who hasn't seen fantastic results before because i can't give up my carbs).  I definitely saw great results with the mat dvds--inches, not pounds, but as soon as I added in the cardio component, the pounds started flying off.
The routines take some time to learn, but you just need to go through the instructional segment and dive right into the routines with music.  You won't achieve perfection right away (or even for a while), but you will get there.  Like many of the other reviewers, I worry about my knees with high Impact aerobics (and injured myself/knees doing jillian michaels), so I only do three routines a day followed by a mat workout (rotating the design series 2 & 3, toning and mat workouts).  I have been doing this for 6 weeks, and have lost 10 stubborn pounds while not modifying my diet much at all, and haven't hurt my knees.  Should mention that I stretch my calfs before and after the workout.  Don't be afraid to try this with modifications despite the negative reviews.",1399161600,5,1286,4.493562231759657
3563258,4,B001F2JVSO,"This is a great workout if you like to dance.  But it is dancing, and it involves more complicated choreography than you usually get in an aerobics class.  I focused on one routine per week, sometimes two.  That way I was able to learn the steps, not get frustrated, and enjoy the workout.  Even doing one routine over and over, if you put in the effort, works up a sweat.",1398297600,3,372,4.271428571428571
3563259,3,B001F2JVSO,"I'll admit, as a daily exerciser I love something that seems more like fun than a workout....Dance does that for me.  Oftentimes, I borrow dvds to try and feel like I really waste my time doing the instruction part since I am familiar with dance and have had some dance training.  I will say, don't get cocky like I did and just think that you would just go right into the dance section.  The footwork is intricate, fast and not easy to pick up even if you have no problem with most dance videos.  I think honestly about 4 times going through the instruction probably would have put me in a semi comfortable position in being fluid with the movements.  I loved that the cardio kept you moving and it was broken down by songs/routines.  This is one that I enjoyed, even though I didn't master at first.  I love dance and on a fun factor it was probably a 4 out of 5.  I got lots of steps in (I wore my pedometer), so even if I didn't do everything perfectly, I was still moving and getting some exercise.  I am not sure yet if I want to purchase this, but I do plan to borrow it again to see how long it takes me to perfect the dances.  It is very much like taking a dance class and I liked how she showed the dance from the front and from behind to help you master the steps.  Overall, if you like dance, have a little patience and like your cardio face paced and don't have two left feet, I would say give it a go.  If you don't feel like dance is your thing, or you don't catch on quickly to dance combos, I think this would be too much and especially not for a beginner.",1397606400,,1573,4.071428571428571
3563260,3,B001F2JVSO,"I gave a 3 rating because because she talks a little too long, I want to workout and not listen to directions for more than 10 minutes.

This is a great workout for people who love to dance. I had this one a few years back and it broke.  I liked it so much I bought it again!",1390608000,5,481,3.9791666666666665
3563276,5,B001F2JVSO,"I've been doing this 45-minute cardio routine for about a month now. I like this one better than the dance cardio DVD with her Metamorphosis workout--this one is just more interesting and actually dance-y with mostly-great music.

I am not a dancer but even I could learn these routines. Others reviewers say she gives no instruction which is bizarre because there is an ENTIRE section of the DVD where she teaches you every single move--no music, just Tracy's detailed instructions to teach you. I could never have learned the dance routines without that section. I just love Tracy!  I would watch the instructions for one routine (there are 8) then do it to the music. Then go back, learn routine 2, then dance to it until about a week and half later and I had learned all 8 routines. At first I would just do those 2-3 of the routines a day until I could finally put all 8 together. Now I am having fun everyday. My calves and ankles are still sore--this is a tough workout but loads of fun during the winter months when I can't go running. It really gets my heart rate up.

I'm already getting tired of her music (which is actual good music and not made-up instrumental like her meta DVDs) so I'm playing my own playlist which is even better. This would not be possible if you had to listen to Tracy blab her instructions the whole time. But that's why I love Tracy, she teaches you the moves, then shuts up and lets you listen to your own favorite tunes. Before you know it you've done all 8 songs and feel great. I skip the warm up as I do my muscular structure from Meta before this DVD so I am plenty warm but then I go back and do the warm up for my cool down.

Yes, there are some editing problems on this DVD but I love it so much I don't even care that some of the routines she skips parts or doubles up on other parrts. Tracy had made this non-dancer a lover of dance cardio.",1390435200,15,1888,4.26536312849162
3563277,1,B001F2JVSO,"I bought a DVD and really disliked the fact that there was too short a time on one move and it was too hard to follow. I kick myself for not returning it. When I emailed them I got a link to their return policy. If the DVD is unopened you can return it within 30 days. This is their UNCONDITIONAL guarantee. How can you determine if you are satisfied with the product unless you open it. This was the worst response to a customer service department that I have ever even imagined getting.

3563279,5,B001F2JVSO,"I purchased this dvd to use post third baby (I am also 28), along with her postpartum mat dvd, and some others.  I didn't start to use this until about a month ago til I felt strong enough, and I love it. For me personally, I just viewed the first cpl sequences beforehand and went straight into it. She repeats the same sequences repeatedly for each song and didn't take long to get. I also, personally, like the lack of cueing as I can just dance and not hear the same things over and over. There are extensive learning chapters from front and back if you do want to learn choreography beforehand, and workouts have choices of front and back, so I felt that was very accommodating for different ways that people learn.  It is challenging, but realistically doable, you might need to work up to have endurance for entire thing.  At first I was only able to do about 5 of the 7, but can now do all:) however, if you have bad knees or ankles,, this may not be best choice.lots of jumping and springing, almost non-stop.

It basically just her flailing around with no instruction at all, I didn't even break a sweat!  The food plan is completely unrealistic and normal people cannot possibly expect to stick to it.

3563285,5,B001F2JVSO,"This DVD is for someone who isn't scared of bouncing around your apartment. I have never taken professional dance classes but I am not scared to go straight into the routines without learning the moves first; Yes, I look like I am flailing around like a chicken, doing a spin or a jumping jack whenever I get lost, but I don't mind. You pick up the moves and memorize them the more you do them, and even though I don't know them by heart right now and have only done half of the songs, I cant wait to learn them in full... I know it will be that satisfaction you get from finally being good at something you have practiced diligently, like being good at Math after it finally ""clicks"".

I personally cant stand traditional workouts, so I seek out cardio DVDs that have dance incorporated in them; There is no traditional strength training which is a huge plus for me. This one is by far the best one I have found, if you are looking for something more advanced that will really make you sweat, and the mood of the DVD is more uplifting and fun than it is corny.

One thing I will warn is that doing this barefoot on my hardwood floors really tore my calves; I had to walk like a penguin for a day, and had never had that kind of injury in my life--yes, I've had sore calves and muscles, but this was really something else. I've been trying to work up to doing the DVD without shoes so I don't drive my downstairs neighbors crazy but I would really advise to get some kind of sneakers for this workout unless you have calves of an Olympian.

This downside is not Tracey's fault, though! Preview the DVD before you go straight into to so you know what you are getting yourself into! I would advise to edit the moves by just lightly bouncing instead of doing a full jump that could lead to overworking the calf muscles, ESPECIALLY if it is your first time doing the DVD.",1382486400,3,1867,4.28328611898017

It would have been a great workout if I had been a client of Tracy Anderson and known what her workouts were like, but because I was new to her style, I was confused almost the whole time as to her timing and movement.  It is completely inconsistent and she doesn't count out her position timing so you find yourself bending and twisting to see if you are still in the right position only to find out 90% of the time, you are not.  She also doesn't tell you what moves and positions are coming up next until you are already supposed to be in them.  I was pretty disappointed because I really wanted to enjoy this dvd workout.

It was annoying having to fast forward through combinations 1, 2, and 3 when I was trying to learn combination 4. There are a total of 8 combos.

I like the idea of a several dance routines but there is a lot of jumping and entirely too much twirling for my taste. The work out is hard on the knees and I am only 35 and in ok shape, but could do without the twirling. Plus, when you're twirling you can't see what move she's on. They got creative with the camera work, but that doesn't really help when you are trying to imitate someone! I'm not sure why she bothered to teach some of the steps. Seems to me she should start out by staying ""Try to do what I do and keep up."" LOL Half the time I was doing a galloping/pony dance in place trying to see what she is doing. I'm going to stick with it because even though I may not be doing exactly what she is doing.. I am moving and burning calories and I did feel it the next day. Maybe a few more times I'll be able to do more then 2 steps per song. There is great benefit in a video that has more then one ""leader"" because then you can watch another person for modifications.

I highly recommend Turbo Jam. Chalene likes what she's doing and keeps the energy up. With this video I felt like I was at a dance off that I was failing miserably at.

UPDATE: After 2-3 weeks I am able to keep up with the first 3 songs and have learned to get some of the moves. The dances are still hard on the knee and I do some modification through the twirling because I just can't twirl that much (without feeling super dizzy)I am enjoying the workout and it is definitely intense. I did purchase the MAT workout but have not tried it yet. Still hoping to master this dvd.

Even when you're not lifting weights you feel the burn all over you.  This dance DVD, however, is a good one but the dance moves are far too complicated.  Like everything else, it gets better with time and energy devoted to doing the moves.  Quite honestly, as someone who has never been all that graceful when it comes to dancing of any kind, it moves too quickly for the average person.  It is a dance cardio workout, like it says, and I guess she felt that she had to do some kind of supplement to her other workouts.  If it went slower it would not be a cardio workout, so it's a Catch 22.  Probably a more adept or experienced dancer would be able to keep up.

It took a while to get the first dance with a lot of pause and rewind, but eventually I got it, and the rest of the dances were easier to pick up. They all follow an 8 count. I would learn one dance at a time, then add a new one once I mastered the previous dance. I really liked the mental challenge because it prevented me from getting bored.

I have no dance background, but I am not a beginning exerciser. I bulk a lot in my legs, and I have trouble with weight fluctuations, so I thought this would be an ideal workout for me. Within 2 months or so of doing it, I have dropped a pants size and I am leaner in my torso. It really works. I took me about 2 weeks to get all eight dances, and sometimes I still pause for breaks in between dances. It gets a little hard after the 4th and 5th dance to do them full out. You have to listen to your body, and know when to take breaks, or just modify a routine.

Yes, it does cause physical discomfort at first. However, I have played sports, and there is no workout worth it's salt that doesn't cause some sort of soreness until you get used to it. Athletes get sore muscles, so do dancers. This is normal, and means you are actually exerting yourself.

Tracy's method is unorthodox. I don't know how anyone, especially a beginner, can commit to both DVDs in a row six days a week. It's not necessary. Just eat healthy, pace yourself with the dance cardio and you will see results. This is coming from someone who has a real struggle maintaining a lean figure.

It's as if Tracy Anderson expects everyone who buys the DVD to have their own dedicated empty room in their home to do her ""exercise dancing"".  You need at least a 12 by 12 foot empty dance studio to even try to do the ""routines"" that Tracy tries and fails to teach you.

Most exercise dvds have a section where the basic moves are isolated, shown and taught before they are incorporate into a routine.  Not with Tracy Anderson's DVD oh no. You're suppose to read her mind and instant pick up on the routine that she changes on a whim.

The dance cardio workout also requires a large moving space as you are literally leaping and pirouetting around your space. Adding to the difficulty; she gives few verbal cues, and her dance sections are long and complex. She does not start slowly with one section and then adding sequentially until you are following along with a stream of movement - she simply begins with the long stream of movement and (despite your previous practice) you are sort of ""playing catch"" trying to keep up with her. I was a ballet dancer (15 years ago, yes, but I didn't think I lost all my skills) and this is very difficult and honestly felt like a waste of time. I can think of a handful of alternate workouts I would suggest prior to attempting this one.",1365724800,2,1050,4.50261780104712

Like other reviewers, I didn't want to bother with the tutorial, so I started using this by just repeating one song at a time, until I learned the routine for that song.  At each subsequent workout, I've been adding on one new song.  I'm slowly learning the whole thing, and it's been a fun process.

Be sure to stay on the *balls* of your feet when doing this; if you put your foot down flat, you'll get a lot of shin pain.

The songs are also really fun to dance to, and I've been loving how graceful I feel doing these routines.  If you have the patience to take your time with the songs, this DVD is definitely fun -- and challenging!",1364428800,,881,4.271084337349397

If you're patient, after the third time through, muscle memory will kick in and you will be dancing away!  I religiously wear a heart rate monitor to track my calories.

3563412,5,B001F2JVSO,"I'm one of those people with a dance background who thought the routines were too complex at first but I found a way to make the DVD work for me and now I love it! Whatever you do, you're going to need a wood floor. I don't think carpet is a smooth enough surface to execute the turns. Your foot will stay in one spot while the rest of you tries to twist around and your knees will bear the brunt. Also, you need a good pair of shoes. I went through three pairs before I settled on Nike Shox. To really make good use of the routines, you need to understand how to utilize the ""pause"" and ""rewind"" features on your remote control. Tracy doesn't take up space on the breakdown by going over the same thing repeatedly. You're going to have to rewind and do that for yourself. When you factor in the momentum that is actually in the routines as they are ""performed,"" some moves look different. So in addition to learning the choreography in the breakdown section I would watch, pause and rewind in the performance section to really understand what you're supposed to be doing. Thankfully you have ""front"" and ""back"" views to chose from. If this all sounds like a lot of effort just to learn a routine, take heart: the mental challenge is a big reason why I look forward to working out. I still don't always get everything 100%, especially considering that there are editing flaws. But eventually you remember those little differences as well. As a result of engaging your brain and not just your body, 48 minutes of Tracy's cardio goes by FAST. There is a lot of bouncing so I would employ a technique dancers use called ""pulling up."" Essentially you are using the muscles all over your body to hold up your skeletal structure so you are at your tallest. I find that this lengthening, heightening posture keeps your weight from settling at your knees.",1361836800,5,1847,4.483679525222552

Ok, it's noted that yes, it's not going to be for everyone, but I'm seeing hundreds of dancers complaining due to the fact they've been dancing for 20+ years and still can't grasp it. That's fine, but EVERY dancer is different, im 21 and have only danced for 13 years which I've noticed is less than a lot of people who've  written reviews. Some peoples coordination skills will be better than others, regardless of how long you've been trained.

My point is, this DVD is fantastic, the results are beyond my expectations, I do the whole thing 5-6 times a week and feel healthy and fit. My flatmate wanted to get fit and has never worked out once in her life, she's got 'two left feet' as she said and with time she can easily complete these dance combinations. It's going to happen over night, it took a few weeks to memorise everything to be able to perform it to the full potential, but have patience and if your serious about it, you will find it's fun, challenging and the results are fantastic. Have sone faith guys, this really is a great work out!",1359244800,2,1155,4.469194312796208
3563420,4,B001F2JVSO,"Like many other reviewers, my initial thoughts on this DVD were that the dance combinations were too hard for a non-dancer to learn.  I am not a dancer, have limited experience in dance aerobics classes,  and am familiar with ""8 count"" moves, but after spinning like a crazed whirling dervish on my first few attempts, I gave up.

But that little voice inside encouraged me to try again.  That's when I noticed that the DVD menu offers two options for viewing the workouts - front (what I'd been trying) AND back (feels like you're in a live workout with instructor in front of you).  I wish all aerobic DVDs had this helpful option.  I used the back option and nailed the first dance routine, which turned out to be the hardest to learn for me.  In fact, the routines actually became fun, especially #4.  This is an excellent workout in all aspects.

Tips: you will need at least a 10 x 10 unobstructed space to utilize this workout.  You need room to take 4 skipping steps front to back and side to side, and room to basically roundhouse kick without damaging walls or furniture.  If you have downstairs neighbors, bring them a bottle of wine and politely ask when would be the best time for you to stomp for an hour without disturbing them.

Maybe a tip: the only clear 10 x 10 space in my apartment is carpeted. I found it very hard to perform the DVD dance moves on carpet while wearing sneakers.  Too much friction.  So I just do the workout in socks and have not experienced any knee or ankle pain.

Interesting: I suffer from severe lower back pain due to a car accident that is worsened by climbing stairs, running, and even using elliptical machines.  I don't experience any back pain with this workout, which is much more intense than traditional exercise.

The trick to this DVD is to pace yourself slowly.  Watch the first dance instruction section repeatedly, then try the workout.  Once you're comfortable with it, try the next routine.  You'll find that Tracy repeats many dance steps so the later routines should come more easily.  The routines involve a great deal of jumping, kicking, skipping, and spinning.  I found myself getting more exhausted as I became more experienced with the routine, and I figured out that I was able to focus on kicking higher and working out more intensely when I did not have to focus all of my attention on the choreography.

I have to dock a star because of the poor DVD formatting.  There are no chapters for the individual combinations, so it's rather annoying to spend several minutes fast-forwarding and rewinding to find and practice the 8 combinations.  (Yet there's a special chapter where you can listen to Gwyneth Paltrow discuss how having children and a job isn't an excuse not to work out, because she has them too!  Wow Gwyneth, you're just like all of us.)  You can also hear people coughing and talking from time to time, and some of the repeated footage is incorrect.

Bottom line: give this DVD a chance and I think you will like it.  And no matter how ridiculous or bad a dancer you think you are, trust me, no one on the planet looks sillier than I do while performing this workout.",1359072000,5,3153,4.570409982174688

The first copy I received had non-working audio, but +1 to Amazon for replacing it within two days.
Once I was able to use the DVD, I was disappointed. Even though Tracy claims she can take ""anyone"" and do this, having no dance background makes using this effectively pretty much impossible. She runs through the steps slowly at first, but really only one time, and then it's full-out. Then, as the actual workout dance part occurs, it's basically just watching her do all the moves perfectly with hardly any encouragement, reminders, counts, anything.

3563439,4,B001F2JVSO,"**1/30/13 Update** I suggest using the ""back view"" than the ""front view."" In the back view, she is pretty accurate. The front view, she misses a bit of the steps and can throw you off, especially while learning. Just a note. :) It threw me off at first, but I've got the routines down enough now where it did not bother me.

I am not a dancer.
Never have been.
I can dance out at clubs, parties, but following along with instruction, I'm not very good.
I grabbed this DVD and thought I'd try it. It took me a while to get the hang of the first dance routine. After about 3 separate times, I think I've got it. I find Tracy's method is about following along with the music, having fun, and doing the best you can. She has great style and I'm sure I look chaotic doing these moves, but I'm having fun and challenging myself.
The second sequence is a bit easier to follow.

The moves got a bit easier for me with each routine. There are 8 dances and for me personally, I found the moves more manageable from 2-8. Not sure why...

**Be sure to watch and follow the breakdowns of each routine!** If you go into each track and try to follow her, you will get frustrated and frustrated quick. Take the time to really learn the moves and have fun. :) I also enjoyed the random coughing dude off-set during one of the breakdowns. ha! :)

For those having a hard time: keep trying and don't give up. Don't focus on trying to do exactly what she does or look exactly like she does because that will take a lot of time. Follow and feel the music and have fun. :)",1354838400,4,1550,4.191275167785235

3563455,5,B001F2JVSO,"I love this DVD so much. I think the main reason why people dislike Tracy Anderson's Dance Cardio DVD is because you need to exercise patience when learning each dance. I have no dance background at all, and I found learning the first dance the hardest, but they became quicker to learn as I went along. I really enjoy engaging my brain as much as my body in this workout, as it keeps me from getting bored. I think it took me two weeks in total to learn all the dances.

It's so much fun to be able to do all eight dances one after the other! I love that no-one is barking orders at me during the workout either - I can just dance. This IS a high intensity workout, and it will strip fat from your body very effectively and build lean muscle in its place, guaranteed. However, I'd suggest you cultivate a moderate cardio fitness level before attempting this, and if you have any pre-existing knee or ankle injuries, perhaps skip it or consult your doctor. Having said that, I think the key with this DVD is to stay light on your feet as dancers always do. If you land heavily on your feet you are bound to encourage injury.

I actually look forward to doing this DVD every day, and like to combine it with Tracy's Mat DVD, which is genius too. It's a hell of a workout, but that's what we're all here for, right?",1338163200,4,1313,4.248
3563456,4,B001F2JVSO,"I just really do not know how many stars to give Tracy sometimes. I have so many praises and criticisms for her. I am critical of her method in general; her expectations of us to workout 2 hours a day 6 days a week with ONLY her products. And as I stated on my review of her mat work, I did just that for 7 weeks last summer-except after boredom and burn out took over, I reduced her method to 4 to 5 days per week and had such small results for so much work.

First of all, the 4 star rating is really only how I rate it for me; the dance cardio is probably not a four star rating for the average exerciser and especially not for someone who has 2 left feet or is a complete beginner. I love her dance cardio routines because I adore dancing and it is the only thing I have in my collection of DVD's that really gets my heart rate going and enjoy myself at the same time. I just dread the typical high intensity workout videos that have no fun to them. I love dancing so much; but why does her music have to suck? Tracy has a few OK songs, but generally I find most of the routines interesting and only like a few of the songs. Again- I am critical of her, but I still find myself going back to her dance routines to get a good workout. But I do not only do this video- I mix this DVD with her youtube routines, and with her first dance cardio that she released in 2006 perhaps. I am not sure if you can still get her first one online somewhere, but I liked some of the songs and routines from the older video and mix up my favorite ones with this particular DVD. Luckily, I do not really get too many shin splints from her routine, but my cardio is rarely good enough to do all 8 or 9 songs. I often get through only 6 songs. She wants everyone to do her mat work first- which is what I used to do- but it left me no energy for the cardio. I was only able to get through it if I did her dance cardio first, or only do it without the mat.

Criticisms-most of us want and need to just dive into a routine- with her it is almost impossible, you must learn the choreography first-which can take alot of time. I took the time because I had so much of it last summer and because I was so eager to learn the dances. Most people will just get intimidated and give up. At first you must do the tutorials and learn the moves while doing some other type of cardio. As another reviewer stated, you can use the tutorials as a mini-workout-actually the tutorials did get my heart rate up a bit and is not a bad idea for a beginner who loves to dance to use this as their primary workout. A beginner cannot do this at all IMO until they build their legs and cardio, they can only do the tutorial. I am at an intermediate level in the cardio area, but with Tracy, I still have trouble doing all 9 songs. And yes, some of the songs are hard to learn, but their are a few songs with fairly easy choreography- actually not much choreography at all, just bouncing around and I do not like those particular numbers at all. The particular numbers will also be dangerous for those with weak knees, ankles, and will be prone to shin splints. If someone is very heavy, this cardio routine is also too much and will cause injury.

Summary- Tracy, I like you and your routines, but not the method in general. I will buy any future economical DVD's with fun and easier dance routines and would love for you to make a ballet DVD. And get some better and more motivational music! I have seen that a new beginner dance cardio DVD has been made, so perhaps she is listening to her viewers and on the right track. I think that some parts of her method are great but need revising. But I still believe that her DVD's should be used in a rotation and many of us need to build more muscle to lose weight faster; many of us also do not bulk up.",1335657600,4,3809,4.0625

I tried really hard to like this dvd, I did the instructional part about 4 times in a week (the first few times I thought that the instructional part was the workout! I got sweaty enough just doing it).  I thought I had the routines down, but when I went to do the actual workout, I was completely lost and felt like I was just jumping around in circles.  I didn't give up and kept trying, time after time.  I have had the dvd about 2 months now and still can not get through the entire thing.  It definitely is a workout, but I guess I am not coordinated enough even though I take dance classes, yoga classes, and horseback ride.  I would much rather do the 10-minute solutions that are free on my netflix instant or my gaiam yoga tapes.  They are a lot easier to understand because of the instruction and uncomplicated moves.

3563461,4,B001F2JVSO,"okay so I did this for the first time today! and it went great...
i watched the first 3 routines last nite, then i gave it shot this afternoon!
it took about 15-20 mins for me to learn the 1st routine without errors, counting myself out, and up to tempo!
instead of going to the part where tracy dances full out all the routines back to back, i just repeated 3 times where she demos facing toward you and then away from you for a total 30 mins workout about.
i think most people can do this workout.
i'm 5'7 need to loose 25-30 lbs. in the past i've had dance as a child and track and field in highschool, but being in my 30's and a complete bookworm, i still managed to p/u the choreo and get thru the 1st a few times then i did the mat dvd (that was way harder, but good! it's over an hour long and my arms burn, i didn't think i would make it to the end but i made smaller movements and finished).
i would recommend having enough space to move freely and just go over it and over it at your own pace until you get the steps, then like tracy says get in a zone a perform the dance.
also, the lack of cues and excess babble is really a gift! bc i was doing kettleworx and swore at that man everytime he said something bc it was all so annoying and repeated twice over word for word, BORING!
overall, this workout was pretty cool!",1322870400,2,1330,4.003759398496241
3563462,3,B001F2JVSO,so i truly wasn't sure how to rate this bc if you can pick up things quickly it is a true cardio and would give it a 5 star but i'm not very coordinated..wish i was but this takes time.  you really have to learn the moves. she goes over three dance moves and just learning one for me was complicated bc she moves  very quickly once you have learned the steps.  its truly like your dancing..not the average cardio classes. if i could get the moves down..wow it would be fun! what i do so i don't get frustrated is spend about 15 min going over the first dance move..this has been going on for a week. i still haven't learned the other two as im still struggling on the first. so enjoy if you want a dance challenge..but for the dancers out there already this should be a piece of cake for you. might not enjoy the repetition as that is what she does.,1320710400,,849,4.102409638554217
3563463,3,B001F2JVSO,I have been doing her work outs for over a year and I am very happy with the results. As far as this dvd goes in my opinion it was ok. It did take a while for me to learn the moves and I did get frustrated quite a bit. But it did not take me long and once I got it down it was easy.,1319500800,,282,3.287878787878788
3563464,5,B001F2JVSO,"I bought this from somewhere else a little less than a month ago. I really don't consider myself a dancer at all and things never click with me the first time around. So far I have still only learned the first four segments, because I don't have a lot of time to spend learning them. It is true that when you have a limited amount of time to exercise, it is hard to justify spending hours learning the steps in slow motion, but even if you just learn one of them you can easily get a good workout by playing it over and over. Until this weekend, I would just keep rewinding the DVD and doing the first two routines about three times in a row, so that amounts to about 30 minutes of exercise. I have yet to do the warm-up. I always start it around the 5-minute mark, watching her from behind. I spent a couple of hours yesterday learning the third and fourth ones - the fourth is my favorite so far. If you ""sleep on it"" it makes more sense the next day. It actually seems more complicated and awkward when she does the moves slow, and of course it is okay if you mess up here and there. If you are like me and don't learn very quickly, just keep playing back the instructional parts over and over and don't try to learn more than one at a time. There really is something kind of rewarding about finally ""getting it"". I don't think I have done the DVD enough to lose weight, but I am definitely drenched with sweat after each session. I don't have any shoes like hers so I just do it barefoot - not sure if that is a good idea.",1316304000,,1526,4.107023411371237

Did anybody review this video or direct her because she is acting like a twelve year old jumping around her house. Who was the target audience, it certainly couldn't be anybody above the age of 19. She is jumping around, on the balls of her feet yet, in what appears to be segment, after segment of freestyle dancing. Oh better yet, all to a techno beat---really Tracy? I don't think I could give this away. It's hard to believe anybody with any production or media know-how allowed this to come to market. Most people do not have a livingroom the size of a gym where they can romp and prance like a free-style maven. I think only Tracy could be in love with this farce of a cardio workout, the only people who could safely and effectively carry out the myriad of moves would be another dancer. Now, this is no reflection of her Mat video which I think is awesome.",1315353600,3,928,4.369942196531792
3563466,1,B001F2JVSO,"Please do not waste your money unless you have formal dance training.  These are not workout tapes but a series of camera shots of Tracy Anderson jumping up and down.  Truly she is a terrible instructor for workout tapes because she does not breakdown the moves or steps.  In one segment she literally says not to worry if you can't follow along but just jump up and down...and in a few weeks you should be able to follow her moves.  Impossible to catch on with no explanation, for the untrained person it looks like she is having muscular spasms.  Trust me I have bought numerous workout tapes with excellent instructors unlike these!",1313107200,,635,4.633928571428571
3563467,4,B001F2JVSO,"I used the TA Mat, Post Pregnancy, and Perfect Design Series workouts for about a year and a half combined with running for cardio.  The results over that time period were great, but I began to plateau and wanted to be in the best shape possible so I decided to try the dance cardio dvd.

Learning the combinations took the most time and I had to dedicate a little more than a week to get them down. I was pretty surprised at how winded I felt after just 7 minutes, but after a two weeks I really started to notice my body transforming and could see how combining the cardio DVD with the more technical workouts really takes things to the next level.  I prefer this cardio DVD over some of her other ones and use it whenever I'm stuck inside.  I'll also swap it in when I want to have a longer cardio segment than the 30 minute disk from the Metamorphosis set.

I definitely recommend this if you don't mind learning dance combinations, prefer to workout at home, and enjoy the other TA Method workouts!",1312329600,2,1003,4.342245989304812
3563468,4,B001F2JVSO,"What I love about this video is that she has a chapter where she teaches the moves to you and ""breaks them down"". Then, you can choose to follow her back or her front when doing things at the regular speed.

I should preface this review by saying I studied dance for about 15 years while growing up, but haven't danced in about 15 years (as an adult). That said, I can understand why non-dancers would be very frustrated with this video. Tracy is the typical dancer in that when she breaks down the routines and teaches them to you, it seems reasonable. But then, when she is dancing the routine at the regular speed, the moves morph into something not exactly like what she teaches. This is very normal in the dance world. Also, the musicality on the first routine is especially tough to follow if you're new to dance because some moves are on the ""down"" count and some are on the ""up"" count.

I like this video because it is challenging. I love dance and the process of learning a routine. I like that Tracy isn't constantly counting out or yelling the names of moves at you. Yes, you have to take the time to learn the routines. Just learning them will kick your butt! Learn the first one from her break down chapter and then have your TV remote ready to pause and go back while watching her do the dance portion at regular speed. It took me 45 minutes to learn the first chapter - watching her carefully to see how she ""danced"" the parts that I couldn't seem to keep up with when doing them as per her break down instructions. You kind of just have to ""feel it"" and figure out how those moves translate when ""danced"" versus being walked through.

I also like that there is room to grow with this DVD. I will not be bored any time soon. I like that you can learn the first routine and then do that workout. When you have time, you can work on learning the second, third, etc. So, you can build up your brain and your body!

Bottom line - if you used to dance, you will get it and you will be fine. You'll feel those old dancer muscles working and you'll be thoroughly excited at the results you KNOW you're going to get. If you have never taken a dance class and have zero patience, then you should probably try something else. After all, if you don't like the workout type, then you're not going to do it and then what's the point? Maybe try one of her Metamorphosis workouts? I've heard they're great.",1311120000,3,2406,4.29295154185022
3563469,1,B001F2JVSO,I have never written a bad review for a workout DVD before but this one deserves a bad review.  I like to dance but this will just make you down right mad.  I have nothing good to say about this video.  I am getting rid of it ASAP!,1310947200,,231,3.7708333333333335
3563470,5,B001F2JVSO,"I bought it at Ebay for a sale, anyway a lot ppl complain it is hard. It is not hard for a dancer like me that just hit a choosen menu ""dancer cardio combination"" she will goes both low and high moderstaion (speed) sometimes I have to catch my breath for 15 mins and drink water sitting before going on.

I remember a woman from TurboJam said to stay low moderation if you are not used to high speed , high really don't help you lost weight. It is the moves. I lose over 30lbs.

She kept explaining abt how to do the dance and why it did begin. She did talk a lot in every menu esp. for intruductory, it is the hours of talking no dancing!

I can't believe ppl say she doesn't explain dance, I am deaf- (can't hear or talk) ...there is no subtitle on dvd. I had to watch when she begins danciong then I copycat. That how is I keep up.

 She does talks a LOT before the dancing , and explain how to do ""elf"" dancing or whatever in the beginning of Dancing cardio. It really doesnt matter what menu u choose. I chose dance cardio combination. But later on she stop talking too much and starting danceing a lot... That is how I like it better.

HISTORY (Where did she get Dancing from?):

You may have heard she went college stuying on dance , but the truth that night when I was watching Beyonce's 4th year
talking about her world and how she dancing . I been dancing for 2 weeks to Tracy A. dvd. I noticed Beyonce's dancing tutorial from African guys chorographed . I think it is probably where Tracy got from , I am no expert. They just seems to have the same footwork in some way. I know it was not her orginial dancing working. She must have copycat and added up some dancing try make us confused. It aint gotta work. hahhaha I can spot some footwork.

Be sure to go google on Beyonce of 4 or youtube and look at her dancing taught by two black guys.",1310601600,,1852,4.110803324099723

3563493,1,B001F2JVSO,I have Tracey Anderson's sculpting dvd's and I think they are great. I think the cardio was done poorly. The dance instruction is overwheming at the beginning.

3563494,2,B001F2JVSO,"I already have Tracy's Mat Workout DVD and I am very happy with it. It's well put together and you can pick up the moves fast to make it effective for you from the very beginning.
Quite contrary is the truth regarding her cardio workout. She goes first through 8 different series of movements which itself takes probably half an hour. There is lots of turns and fast transitions between the movements. In short, it's complex for someone who has never done aerobic dance. The DVD requires a lot of time to learn. I was just disappointed because I am a busy mom and for me to find an hour every day is not always easy. To spent few months learning the routine is not simply worth it for me. SO I am giving it only 2 stars.",1306454400,,720,4.22463768115942

Also, you burn calories and work up a sweat just learning the steps.  my advice is to learn one dance and do it over and over and over again until you have it totally memorized.  Then learn the second one and do the first one and the second one over and over again for thirty minutes.  keep on adding the routines.  before you know it, you will have learned them all. I never do all of the dances.  I just do 6 routines, so that is 30 min of cardio and that is enough for me. Also, now i dance to my own music and it is so much fun.  I always work up a good sweat and most days i look forward to the workout.  This is saying a lot b/c i hate doing most types of cardio.  if you have the patience to learn the routines, you will love this workout!",1303776000,9,904,3.806451612903226
3563496,5,B001F2JVSO,"I am a workout video freak - I've done tons of different types.  This is very choreographed dancing, but it is so fun once you get the moves down. You have to go through the breakdown section to get the gist, then you have to practice and practice and be patient -because Tracy is very skilled and makes it looks easy. You will sweat!  It works out every muscle in your body, including your brain, because you have to think about how you are moving at all times. Each song (there are seven I think, I'm still learning #5)has a different dance to learn, but she demonstrates a fairly long pattern which you repeat throughout the song. I think this is a great way to give you a chance to learn the moves and perfect them (which I'm not even near close to ""perfection"" yet.)  I've had to add one song at a time, and do it at least three times semi-successfully before even thinking about adding another one.

I'm a new fan, and I definitely plan on getting more Tracy Anderson videos.  I would not recommend this workout to anyone with super weak knees or ankles, unless you take it very slow. I'm thrilled that I feel like even those muscles are getting in great shape now because of the turns and jumps -

Dancing is only half of what Tracy recommends, she also teaches ""muscle work"" to help develop the muscles and body awareness you'll need to be successful with the dance part - it's all good stuff! I'm over forty and FINALLY seeing some changes to my body that I've been hoping to see :)

You do need an open space, and a hard floor would work best - but you can do it on carpet if you can pay attention to what you are doing. I didn't have hard flooring, but its working out great but I have to stop if my one of my kids or husband talks to me, because the turns and jumps require you to be light on your feet!",1303257600,2,1815,4.198275862068965

I really wanted to like it, as I do a lot of Yoga and Pilates and I wanted to incorporate some dance moves in my workouts for fun, but I found it to be very boring and repetitious, in spite of finally learning the dance moves and being able to actually follow her and synchronize with her.  You just jump around like an Easter Bunny to very upbeat music to get your heart rate up, something you can accomplish for free with a jumping rope.
I gave up on this DVD as I got bored fast.  I found that Cindy Crawford work-out DVD's , as old as they are, to be way more fun than  Tracy's DVD's. I'm so mad I bought into all the hoopla surrounding Tracy Anderson and wasted my money on this DVD! And it is not cheap either!",1302825600,,765,4.019736842105263
3563498,1,B001F2JVSO,Tracy Anderson has no accreditation in any sort of physical training or physiological training. Her methods involve eating less than 1000 calories a day. With such a gross calorie deficit you could lose weight no matter what your workout routine was like. She demonstrates basic gym class type flailing that will elevate your heart rate but is not worth the money. Stay away!,1302134400,5,375,4.968253968253968

3563500,2,B001F2JVSO,"While this workout will definitely get your pulse rate up, I was looking for a straight forward, one hour, high impact aerobic workout that I could pop in the DVD player and then be done. As a busy mom of two toddlers, I just didn't have the time to learn each combination (there are 8)and then put it together in order to do the entire workout. While I realize that it makes the most sense to learn each combination gradually until one coordinates the moves, and getting up 2hrs earlier or going to bed 2 hours later is an option in order to accomplish this goal, I have so much more I need to do in addition to working out 1.5 hrs a day. I'm just not willing to invest that much more time in to learning dance combinations in order to actually feel like I had a good cardio workout. With that said, Tracy's mat DVD is great for toning and a much better investment than the dance cardio. I've been better off just going to a one hour kickboxing class at the gym.

She is lazy when it comes to cuing.  She just doesn't do it. Maybe she is just too cool for that? The tutorial is complex but at least she breaks it down. I tried doing it after only one viewing of the tutorial and didn't make it very far past the warm up. I am not one to give up, so I'll keep trying. The moves are kinda cool.

I really like the Mat workout a lot.  It's different from anything I've ever seen, and I'm already seeing results after a week.  Then this video came in the mail.

Pros:  Great music, visuals, and I like that she does the routines from the front and back so you can follow along whatever way is good for you.

Cons:  I'm almost 43 years old and don't have the strongest back.  Bouncing up and down for 45 minutes is not gonna happen, at least not right off the bat.  I think this video is good for intermediate to advanced level women who have a dance background.

Also, if you're expecting to master it quickly, think again.  It takes some time to learn the routines, so if you're a very busy individual, I suggest trying something else.  I watched the breakdown of the first routine then went right into the routine itself.  I did this until I mastered it, then moved on to the next.  I think the important thing here is to go at your own pace; it is a high impact, heartpounding, blood pumping workout.  Also, I'm not sure what the big deal is about her not doing counts during the routine itself.  She does a complete breakdown and I mean COMPLETE breakdown, from the front, back, left and right.  What more do you need?  She expects you to know it before starting it.  Have a little patience and actually watch the breakdowns.  I personally appreciate the fact that she's not blabbing during the routine.  I enjoying hearing the music.

I have done P90x.. jillian.. pilates.. jari.. and probably own every DVD you can think of. I had a gym membership.. canceled that.. don't get me wrong though I am in pretty good shape but have never gotten the results her method has gave me. This DVD is hard and not for people who give up easily. It is for someone who wants to change their body and introduce a new lifestyle to their daily routine of exercising. Before this I always worked out two hours a day so that aspect is cake.. I find it hilarious when people say 30 min a day will result in drastic weight loss and a banging body.. I mean maybe if your the lucky 1 out of 100 who have a great metabolism but the rest of us must work and I mean work for it. Anyway long story short sorry I blabbed... but honestly Tracy knows whats she's doing and you should trust her. put down your 20lbs and grap those 3 pounders and concentrate on your muscles and control. and up your reps. and that goes for any exercise you do.

3563541,4,B001F2JVSO,"Before I started doing the dance cardio, I had been warned by other reviewers that it wasn't for non-dancers and that the instruction was limited.  But I was so interested to try something different, I didn't really care - so what if it's hard? What if I look stupid? I'll get used to it.  I am an AWFUL dancer and am not graceful.  I have rhythm but I am by no means a ballerina, and I get dizzy with spins.  But I am a runner and I'm fit.  If you're in terrible shape and have no ability to dance and are extremely overweight, then no, you shouldn't do this video.  Isn't that obvious?

When I put the DVD in and started with the first dance, I knew right away that I would have to learn dance by dance and not try to learn them all within the first day.  The key to this program is patience, which no one has.  Once I learned the first dance, which did involve watching 50 times, I was stoked to have memorized it and be able to dance and actually get a work out without counting or worrying about form.  Granted, I only did one song.  I did the same thing the next two times I did the video- just the first song and I did that over and over again (so that I got a total of 20 minutes of cardio).  The repetition was a little boring at first, but I got good at it.  Then I moved onto the next song and so on for the rest.  I can do all 6 songs in a row with the choreography memorized.  But this did take WEEKS not HOURS.

Honestly, after you've done this for a few weeks, you are so thankful that she doesn't talk.  I've done P-90X and Slim in 6 and all these others where they just babble the entire time and it's like shut up already.  You do not need instruction after you've learned the dances, which is what Tracy says.  Trust me - you just have to be patient.

Here are some tips for getting through her videos with some modifications:

-You do need a lot of space.  Particularly if you plan on doing all of the jumps, turns, and traveling movements to the full extent, don't try to do this in a small bedroom.  That is the one downside.  Luckily I have a large living room and I'm not in an apartment, but I imagine if you're in a building, the people below you will be pissed at the stomping.
-Stretch your calves.  I'm a runner, so my calves were already used to bouncing.  If you're not, this video will do you in.  Stretch them out, soak them in hot water, do what you can to keep them from locking up.  It's a lot of hopping, jumping, skipping, and bouncing around.
-Avoid the spins if you get dizzy - every time she spins, I do a jumping jack.  I am not a coordinated dancer, and the turns were just too much, so I skip them.  Easy.
-Stay casual - particularly in the third dance, she messes up and doesn't keep the choreography perfect.  You can even tell where they edited the video to repeat her moves over again.  Just be easy.  I've read people complain that the dance wasn't perfect and THAT'S why they stopped.  Please.  The woman is incredible, so cut her some slack and just go with it.  So your dance is a little interrupted - cry me a river.
-Do the cardio BEFORE the mat workout, not the other way around.  You want your muscles warm during the mat stuff and you don't want your legs to give out during the cardio.
-Dont' quit, just skip a series - if you get tired, just bounce in place during a full combination and jump back in when you can.  Don't give up - the cardio is totally doable for someone who is in moderately good shape.
-Watch those hips - esp if you do this with the mat workout, your hips might lock up.  If your hips start to hurt, lower the intensity of kicks or jumping jacks to minimize the range of motion.

So yes, Tracy is not the best dance instructor in the world - but this is not meant to make you a better dancer, it's meant to help you lose weight.  The dancing part is just means to the end, so don't worry about whether or not the combination is perfectly taught to you.  I read reviews all the time from people complaining how she's a bad dance teacher so they stopped doing it - that just sounds like laziness to me.  Yes the program takes at least 1.5 hours/day 4-5 times/week, yes it's a time commitment.  But guess what - no one gets toned and sexy doing nothing.  It requires hard work - so if you're not willing to put in the time and effort and patience, then try jogging for 2 hours/day or stop eating.

I wrote this about her mat video, too - the moves are not straight forward. Just watch it over again to learn it, but don't complain that the video didn't magically make you drop 5 pounds instantly.  Tracy is not a genie.  It is challenging, hard work but it gives results.  I went from size 6 to size 2 within 2 months.",1283644800,301,4695,4.12348401323043
3563552,3,B001F2JVSO,"I bought this workout a couple of weeks ago along with the mat workout.  I found the cardio dance workout to be too time consuming to learn and am not getting the cardio in because I spend more time watching what she is doing then getting the steps down.  I could get them when she was walking through the steps but once she put it to music I was lost after the first couple of steps.  Maybe it would be easier if she was facing away and doing the steps. I have tried to do dance #1 for a week straight and still no luck.  I have no back ground in dance and now I know I am not very cordinated.  I am 38, a runner and weight lifter and am in shape and was hoping for something fun to stay in shape while my herniated disc heals up but I just can't get her steps down.  I found myself just hopping around through it to work up a sweat but wasn't doing everything she was.  Looking for something that is quicker to learn so I can get my workout in.  Might just have to go back to the elliptical.  I do enjoy the mat workout and my shoulders and arms really burn through the entire segment.",1283212800,2,1087,3.9723502304147464

3563555,3,B001F2JVSO,"This workout is doable given the time and energy. It does take some effort to dance to her choreography, but that is not the greatest challenge this video poses. The movements are very hard on the knees, even for someone within the healthy weight range. Maybe not for a teenager, but for women in their thirties and maybe even twenties, it might be too much of an impact on the joints. I was really excited when I first started to do the dance moves, and even more excited when I mastered three or four of them in a row! Of course, I had to take breaks in between, and was heaving and ho-ing, but I was proud that I had taken up the impossible task and was dancing along with her! However, it is not realistic to do this kind of routine on a habitual basis for most. Because of the knee vulnerability, and because it is so tiring, that if you are not really an advanced exerciser, or athlete, then you can get turned off and feel like a total failure for not being able to complete much of it and not pursue exercise at all anymore! (extreme case, I know, but it can happen to the best of us at times) Motivation needs to fueled by mini spurts of successes every now and then, and this video will always leave you feeling that you are not able to do more more more....enough enough enough...It's a very challenging Cardiovascular workout.",1280534400,3,1338,4.334661354581673
3563556,5,B001F2JVSO,"I read many reviews of Tracy's cardio DVD before purchasing it. I own and love the Mat Routine and have seen beautiful changes in my body after 1 month of solidly committing to it. So.. to I decided to give the Method a try and took the cardio plunge. My background: I am a fit female with strong legs, no knee injuries and no dance experience. For cardio I typically run 2-6 miles at a time, 2-4 x week.  When I started the first dance i was a bit worried. It was difficult and confusing to get but after watching it about 7 times I was getting the hang of it and feeling really good about myself. It kinda makes you feel like you have accomplished something and it makes your body feel good to be coordinated. Yes, she does goof a bit on choreography in a few dances but its no big deal. After I learned the second dance picking up the next 4 was easy. I have only gotten to six and I have had it for a month. I sweat bullets and crack up at myself all the time when I'm doing this workout because its just plain entertaining. It is a ton of jumping and has an 80's flare to it. If you have problems jumping rope do not get this DVD. If you are fine on the balls of your feet for extended periods of time than this is great. Cant wait to get to the last 2 dances and pretty soon I will be using my own music because hers is getting a little old but its not bad. One last thing, I skip the warm-up and cool down so dance 1-5 straight take about 25 minutes of good heart-pumping cardio. For the high energy type of woman who needs a break from spinning and running.",1278892800,5,1565,4.016025641025641
3563557,5,B001F2JVSO,"I read at least half of the reviews here before I actually took the plunge and bought the DVD and I'm SO happy I did. I personally love it.

This is how I reccomend you go about it...

There are 8 different routines and you're absolutely crazy if you just try and jump in and follow her. She is FAST. Crazy fast. So I reccomend you learn each routine and master one at a time. Not only will you have fun learning but you won't get bored because you'll constantly have more to learn. Once you have the routine down, then go and try to follow along. You'll quickly realize she is faster than you'd thought she'd be and is more fluid than what you learned. That's OK. Just keep at it, stay on your toes(literally) and bounce through best you can. Continue working at this until you can do the entire first routine with her(she does it about 8 times or so, I haven't completely counted). Then repeat with rountine number 2, then 3, then 4, and so on and so on. It's a blast!! I've found it so easy to spend an hour learning it everyday and this is coming from someone who absolutely hates working out and is usually dreading every minuted. Before I know it the hour is over, i've sweat a lot, and am even a bit soar the next day.

If this sounds like fun to you too, then buy it. But if you're one of those people who likes to pop it in, follow along like a clone from minute one and do it then you'll be unhappy. It's a learning process. Like literally being in dance class. Sound like fun? It is! but if not, then it's not for you.

Another quick tip. I used to dance so I know how to count(1-8 like typical dance steps) so I assign numbers and learn each count of 8 at a time. So i watch her instructions a couple times, then i'll pause it and go back and forth until I've got it down. Focus on getting each part, then put it together, then watch her do it the fast way and learn to be bouncy and fluid like she is. It's a process and if you like that, then enjoy. I sure love it. :)

Good Luck!",1278720000,3,1994,4.050761421319797
3563558,1,B001F2JVSO,"I was really excited to try out the Tracy Anderson method, but when I got the Dance Cardio DVD, it was nothing like what it said it would be. The dance combinations are difficult, and you need to spend time learning all the combinations before you can even start the workout. It is a total waste of time and a total scam, since they mention nothing about this on the DVD or on the website. I tried to return the DVD but the customer service is horrible here. They took over a week to get back to me, and then said they cannot return OR exchange opened DVD's. But how the heck would someone know if they are happy with it before even opening the package? Beats me! Total scam if you ask me. I'm very bummed that the customer service is so awful. You are much better off spending your money on something from a store where you can return it, or buy a workout DVD that actually provides a workout, not a bad dance instructor and false advertising.

3563560,5,B001F2JVSO,"I'll start by telling you that I used to dance when I was younger, I stopped at 15, and now I'm 20 years old. I wasn't a professional dancer by any means, it was just a 2 to 3 times a week hobby. But I'm really lazy now, and I tried many classes and I did go to the gym before, and nothing was good enough for me, I was bored with everything, and this DVD changed my life basically. I purchased this DVD in the beginning of 2009, I saw it, and gave up... I thought it was to difficult to me. I was wrong, I can tell you right now, you don't need to be a dancer to do this correctly, just give it time. With any cardio work, you have to give it time, especially routine-oriented dance cardio dvds, because you'll have to actually learn the routine.

I'm going to give you some of my tips to doing this correctly and have fun with it:

- First, I tried to learn the first routine to a T, by doing over and over the break-through chapter, when I got it right, I'd do the whole routine with music, from the back. It took me one day to learn it, so for the first day, I only did the first combo and it took me 45 minutes to learn it and perform it.
- On the second day I learned the second combination, it was easer for me.. so after I learned it I went straight to the run through chaper and did the two routines
-Third day, was the same, I learned the third combo and then performed the three combinations, because I learned the third combination a lot faster before the 45 minute mark on my watch ended, I put some up-beat songs on  my stereo and performed the three combos with my own twist
-fourth day, I didn't learn any routine, and just focused on doing the three straight through, it was though!  But I did it

And basically I'll just learn a routine and the I perform the ones I already know, until it hits the 45 minute mark on my watch. I have to tell you that it's really though, and I do a break through every song... I never did the 8 combos straight though, but I'll get there.
You do jump a lot in this DVD so if it bothers you, or if you feel like you can't do it anymore sometimes, just don't hop or jump and instead do the arm work or shake your booty! If you don't like the music, which I do like it a lot, especially the third one, put some music you like, once you learn the routine, and put your own twist in to it, you're gonna love it!

I have to tell you that this is a really though workout, and I usually don't sweat, but whenever I do this work, I sweat until I have no water left inside my body, it's crazy!!!! But it's totally worth it! You'll see differences on your body just a few weeks later...

I do this workout in conjunction with the mat workout, post-pregnancy and the web-episodes. I switch every ten days just like she always tells you to do, and I'm AMAZED with the results. Try it! You'll love it!!",1274832000,7,2838,4.0212765957446805
3563561,4,B001F2JVSO,"The Dance cardio DVD is really hard work!!!!! I like it; she jumps around all the time...I'm not up to her level but I try to follow her....

3563582,1,B001F2JVSO,"Look, I've taken a lot of dance & exercise classes and I own an extensive library of these types of DVDs as well, and Tracy Anderson ranks unequivocally as the worst instructor ever. She does a slow-version breakdown of the dance combinations but she fails to ever put the entire combination to a slow count before she does the whole thing to music so that you can see the various parts and pieces connected in a counted sequence. I had to stop and back up the DVD about a dozen times before I realized that in the first combination, she failed to mention two steps she takes in the up-tempo-to-music version of that same combo. Thus, even though I'd invested an hour in learning the combination as she did it in slow-pace, when she did it uptempo to music, I kept getting thrown off. This is just a big NO-NO! You don't teach one version at a slow pace, never put the whole thing all together to a continuous count, and then add a couple extra skippy little steps in the final, up-tempo version to music! Guaranteed to frustrate even the most adept dancer.
And I wholeheartedly agree about the risk to your knees and all your joints. No doubt, Tracy A. is cute and tiny and looks better skipping than most people look on their best day. But a dance instructor, she is not. A personal trainer, perhaps. But on DVD, she falls WAY short. If you are buying the big hype on this (remember Gwynneth is business partners here, so she has a vested interested in touting Tracy), be prepared to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to learn the combos IN SPITE of Ms. Anderson, and then having to figure out where she's mis-directed you, to boot.
And if you are thinking of buying any of her OTHER DVD's of Tracy's, think monkey-see-monkey-do. She's no good at cueing and likes to make it up in front of the camera, often without balancing the exercise to both sides. Your challenge is to mimic her without benefit of instruction, which means you are going to spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure it all out before you can actually do what she does. If that's what you want, good luck, and best wishes with the knee replacements. If you really want to learn and develop, get some DVDs from some good teachers who have more than just a whole lot of cute to offer.",1274227200,26,2272,4.437799043062201
3563583,4,B001F2JVSO,"I bought this DVD along with the mat workout, and while I find the videos a bit overpriced (which is why I rated the product 4 stars), I am entirely pleased with both with the product and the results! These are, by far, the best workout DVDs I've ever used.  I have been competing in running, cycling, and triathlon events for the past four years and wanted something that I could use inside during the cold winter months.  I was also intrigued by Tracy's concept of slimming rather than bulking, which is something I struggled with during my training...hours and hours of running and cycling had left me feeling like my legs were bigger than they had been before!

I have been using the mat and cardio DVDs for about a month now, and have already noticed distinct results! One major complaint I have with the other workout DVDs that I've tried is that they never get and keep my heart rate up.  Not a problem with this workout!  I definitely break a sweat and feel like I'm getting a good workout in.  The choreography is complicated, but I see this as an asset!  I get bored with workouts easily, and the challenge of adding new sequences kept me interested.  Until I was able to do all of the dances, I would just repeat the ones I knew to fill the time. Now that I'm familiar with all of the sequences, I turn the volume on the DVD off, turn my own music on, and enjoy my workout! I really appreciate that this video is for people who really, truly want to work out.  It is challenging and therefore rewarding.  As I mentioned earlier, I am already noticing results, especially regarding the slimming and defining of areas that were being neglected by my tri training.

I would not recommend this workout to someone who is just starting to exercise; it would probably be a bit too intense. Someone else compared the sequences to jumping rope, and I couldn't agree more.  You will be jumping pretty much the entire time.  While I find it fun and challenging, it could be hard on knees and ankles.  In addition, both the mat and cardio dvds take about two hours to complete, which is more time than most people want to devote to working out on a daily basis.  The cardio routine does require a bit of space as well...I perform the workout in my garage so that I have enough room.  Yes, I feel a little goofy doing the routines and hope that passers-by don't peek inside, but the results keep me going!

Overall, I'm very very pleased that I purchased Tracy's DVDs, and am already thrilled with the results I'm seeing, especially the slimming and definition in my legs (which are my particular problem areas).  Yes, the price is a bit much; but I would recommend these two DVDs over countless other, less expensive, workouts that I've tried.",1270771200,4,2742,4.493951612903226

But her Dance Cardio killed my knees from the get-go.  I am fit and pretty small (5'2"", 105 lbs), and have been working out regularly for over 20 years, and I have never had knee pain until I did this workout.  As others have stated, it's extremely high impact.  My favourite cardio workouts incorporate jumping rope, so I am no stranger to high-impact, but my rope-jumping workouts have never hurt my joints like this.

I want to like this DVD: yes, the routines are challenging, but I can see that the workout can be fun if you stick with it and learn the moves (I was picking up the routines fairly quickly), but I won't ever know for sure because of the knee thing.  If you don't have a fitness background I would absolutely steer clear of this DVD--unless you are a teen who is invincible!  For those of you who are already quite fit and experienced with working out, give Dance Cardio shot, but remain ever mindful of those knees!

3563589,5,B001F2JVSO,"This video series is great. I consider myself a moderate exerciser. After I had kids, I really couldn't get time to go to the gym. I started with the post pregnancy video. I would recommend this for anyone beginning with Tracy, even if you're not post partum. It's a less intense workout than her other videos, but it will help you learn her style and you will see amazing results if you do it as she recommends.

I moved to the dance video next. You absolutely must watch the break down section. I used that as my workout for about 10 days over 2 weeks. After that, I did it full pace from behind. It moves fast, and I did forget some moves sometimes. But after about 2 weeks, I not only could keep up, but I had the moves memorized enough that I could do the video while I watched something else! Don't get frustrated - it seems impossible to master in the beginning. Once you get the hang of it (which is fairly easy), you'll be fine. I am hopelessly uncoordinated, but I caught on. Again, the results are amazing.

The mat video is also great. Overall, the music is great, and Tracy is great. With other videos, I always had the sense that the person in the video was giving a watered down version of their workout. This is Tracy's (and Gwyneth Paltrow's) actual workout. Also, there's no random people in the video working out too. Tracy's manner is very gentle and sincerely encouraging. Watch each chapter of all the videos before you begin. Also, for the post partum and mat workouts you'll need a yoga mat and 3 lb weights.

Tracy recommends that you do mat & cardio 4-6 times per week, and each video is about 50 minutes. I modify the workouts a bit so I can fit it into about an hour and 15 minutes - I start at 5 AM before the kids get up. Gwyneth Paltrow made a comment on Oprah about the kids running around while she works out. I thought she was crazy, but if my kids (who are young) wake up while I am still exercising, I give them a snack and some toys. They know this is Mom's non-negotiable time, and they even do the exercises with me. My oldest ""inherited"" my 2 lb weights when I moved up to 3 lbs!

I do the mat workout and the dance cardio 2x a week along with running, kickboxing, ballet classes, and traditional weight training. The workout is fun and it really works! I am an advanced exerciser and my legs and stomach and arms have never looked so toned. SERIOUSLY. I know she has a lot of negative media surrounding her, but her workouts WORK.  It's obvious to me, a dancer, that she has really good dance training and her workouts are really good for dancers because they work the same muscles dancers use and ignore the ones you don't want to overtrain. I highly recommend her videos for dancers that want to do cardio, but don't want to lose their line and dancer's build. I really, truly, strongly feel that her workouts have made me look better than ever and really given me amazing definition. Plus, the workouts are fun and I look forward to them. Since I am a regular exerciser and in really good shape I do a two mile run first and then do the dance workout.  yes the choreography is hard, but you will learn all 8 combos.  Yes, the editing of the video is a little messed up and sometimes you don't do the same thing on both sides.  After learning the combos just do them the right way. The best way to do the video is like any video: watch her from the front and copy her (so when she's using her right foot you are using your left, you know?).  I highly reccomend this video.

There are a few routines done from the back where she makes mistakes in her choreography, but I just follow the mistakes, it makes it easier to get back in the flow when she gets back in the proper routine. I have never watched the sequences where she would be facing the viewer as I think it would be much more difficult to follow. I learned about 2 routines a day and perfected them before starting the next 2 and it worked great for me, even though I was completely lost at the beginning.

3563606,1,B001F2JVSO,I too was excited to have purchased this DVD and when I ordered and tried it - I was like oh my gosh I wasted my money. It is going to take me 1 month to get the dances down pat and who has time to do this? I just want a workout I can plug and go.,1264636800,2,247,3.2758620689655173
3563607,4,B001F2JVSO,"First off, this is a very high impact workout. You bounce, turn, jump - it's basically pylometrics on steroids.

If you are seriously overweight and not in shape, this probably isn't for you unless you modify it greatly.  I think it'd be too frustrating for those overweight.

If you do not have a decent space to do this workout, preferably on wood type flooring due to the impact, don't bother with this DVD.  You'll get frustrated with the lack of space.

It took me over a week to master the first combo.  I have never danced, and I'm not very co-ordinated - but it can be done with lots of analysis and watching it on slow-motion a zillion times.  If you aren't stubborn and/or patient, I can see why you'd give up.  It looks impossible the first time you watch it at speed...  IMO, Tracy's tutorial isn't super helpful as she changes her steps slightly at speed - it takes work to figure out how she transitions the moves so fast at speed.  If it wasn't for slow-motion, I would have never figured it out.  But it can be done and it's quite rewarding once you figure it out.  You do feel like a rock star and even one 5 minute song is one heck of a workout!

I worry about injuries with this DVD, especially knee ones.  You need dance-type shoes, not walking or running shoes.  I think people need to start this in moderation unless they dance already - even running doesn't prepare your joints for the direction changes and the impacts those demand.

Do it 2-3 a week for 20 minutes at first.  Do some drills if you want to add time to it (I practice one or two steps and go across the room with those steps, then do another move back).  The drills helped me get my balance at moves at speed.

Do interval training until your body adjusts to the impacts and direction changes that are hard on your knees and joints.  For instance, I'll do  2 repeats (she repeats the same moves in the song over and over), so I'll do 2 repeats on the left and right twice then walk while Tracy dances 2 repeats, then I'll re-join for another two.  Trying to do the whole song right away is probably not wise for your cadiovascular system or joints - it's a totally different workout.  Overtime increase it until you do the whole song and then multiple songs.  But to it slowly...

Definately do rest days inbetween. At least 1 rest day, but if you notice pain increase it to 2 or even 3.  Do other cardio on your rest days.  Your body needs to adjust to the demands, slowly - and it will.  Plyometric workouts are usually only done 1-2 a week and this is a tough one.  I imagine it would take at least a year before you could do it 6x's a week, and even then I'm not convinced that's a good idea.

But it's fun and different and TOUGH!  I like it.  I think over time you can do the whole thing multiple times a week, but be wise about it and use moderation.  Buy the right footwear.  Try to find good flooring.  I plan on using this because I can see the usefulness of it - it does challenge all the muscles.  Do drills until your body figures it out.  Practice bouncing and the moves, practice stepping back and leaping.  Practice the puddle jump.  Then practice transitioning from one move to another.  Just the practice drills make me sweat like a pig.

But be careful with it.  You'll either burn out, get frustrated, or injure yourself.  Start with one or two combos at a time to minimize your frustration with it.  Master them.  You'll be so proud when you do.

I would recommend this to certain people who know fitness and are smart about it.",1263945600,10,3539,4.310030395136778
3563608,5,B001F2JVSO,"I think this is a terrific DVD, as is the mat DVD. I have done both--it is very hard to fit 2 hours of fitness into the average person's schedule, but if you can do it, you will truly see the results. (Luckily I don't have kids. I DO have a job that goes over 8 hours a day sometimes.) I can't always do 2 hours, I love food, and I just turned 40, but this series still helps keep me in good shape.

Here's the thing. When I first got this DVD and put it in the player, I thought, There is no friggin' way I can do this. Then I tried going through the instructions, in which I got lost, and I thought, There is no friggin' way I can do this. Then I just jumped into the dance part, and I thought, There is no friggin' way I can do this.

But you can do it. Here's how to do it.

Have patience and take absolutely as long as you need to to go through the instructions. I just kept rewinding nearly every dance move and it took me forever to learn them. However, I did eventually learn them, and when I finally did (it took a long time), it actually WORKS. You will work up a sweat, you will tone up, and you will look great. You just need to have patience. I find that once you've done it a few times and get more comfortable with it, you notice more details and get better at it too.

My one and only complaint, and this is probably somehow my fault, is that both this DVDs and the mat DVD have stopped working in my !@#$ DVD player. The dance cardio DVD looks scratched now so I know that one's my fault, but the mat DVD doesn't look scratched at all and I haven't had that one that long. Has anyone else had this problem? If so, the DVD quality itself may not be all that great. If not, I am tough on DVDs, which wouldn't really shock me. Anyway, I think this is an unusually effective DVD and well worth the money.",1263686400,2,1817,3.9562841530054644
3563609,2,B001F2JVSO,"I first ordered the mat dvd and loved it so much that I ordered her post pregnancy dvd and this dance cardio dvd.  I loved the other two dvds, but I really disliked the dance dvd.  Unless you are trained in dance - well, I would not waste my money.  It is crazy fast paced and no real instruction.  I put the dvd in and literally could not do it.  I do one or the other of her dvds 3 or 4 times per week and love them.",1261094400,,418,3.7045454545454546

For reference, I am an advanced exerciser who runs, spins, kickoxes, etc. - but I like to use exercise dvds as a way to mix things up, but I have found it VERY challenging to find exercise DVDs that raise my heart rate at same level as usual routine. It does take a while to learn the routine, but stick with it - for one week, each day for one hour, I played the instructional section several times and learned 1 or 2 routines - then added on doing the actual dances (with Tracy's back facing viewer), gradually building up until I could do the whole thing.  Even then, each time I do the video I feel like I learn something new in the dances or I master a move a little bit better - it is motivating! She does not talk incessantly through the video, another huge plus! I just ordered the mat dvd since enjoyed this DVD so much and use it a lot.",1260921600,4,869,4.136094674556213
3563611,5,B001F2JVSO,"I have been doing the mat workout DVD for only 3 weeks now (4 to 6 times a week as suggested) and I have already seen huuuge results. I am SO impressed. I have been getting compliments from everyone - without even telling them I have been working out. A friend of mine asked me yesterday how I am looking so toned - I told her and she hopped right on the computer and ordered one for herself.
Before starting Tracy I had a 4 pack at the top of my abdomen - not my ideal shape as it's a bit too bulky and masculine. But tracy's variety of crunches has given me new, feminine lines that I would not have imagined possible in just 3 weeks. I still drip with sweat everytime I do this workout and feel 100% better for it.
The only thing I will say is that you should do your own stretches at the end and hold each of them for atleast one minute. Focus on your hamstrings, shoulder blades and arms - especially after the first time of doing it because you will hardly be able to walk the next day otherwise.
I give this work out 5 stars - I don't care what anyone says! I love your method Tracy! Thankyou for sharing it! :)",1260403200,12,1118,4.04054054054054

Tracy Anderson needs to face the facts, read the plethora of disappointing reviews, and get over herself! This DVD offends the reader's intelligence and fitness experience. As an experienced Dancer I was really offended and disappointed to find that Tracy thinks she does not have to follow the most basic-basics of dance (like an 8-count or calling out the dance moves that people are supposed to be following.. duh, here's a quarter, go buy a clue!). The audience is at home and this DVD should cater to the audience at home, which it clearly does not. Read the reviews. This does not meet even the most basic requirements of a workout DVD's and is a complete waste of money (not to mention risk of injury!)...I do not recommend this DVD to anyone. In fact, I recommend a DO NOT BUY.",1260057600,2,888,4.591194968553459
3563613,5,B001F2JVSO,"I decided to purchase Tracy's Cardio and Mat workouts after putting on some unwanted pounds, I had not worked out in seriously almost 10 years. When I first viewed the video I thought Wow this is impossible! I am not working at this time so I did the breakdown part of the songs for about a week which is really vital unless you are a Vegas dancer or something for myself I am not a dancer and still need to view the breakdown part to pick up on some of the moves (I have only been doing this about 1 month). I then went on and did the whole video she says to do as many as you can. During the warm up I am fine but those first 2 to 3 songs I am hurting then something wonderful happens after that my muscles warm up and loosen up and I can do it just fine. The more you do it the easier the moves become and it is fun surprisingly so! I cant believe I am doing it you feel so good about yourself not only because you decided to workout but because of the fast results. She is working so many muscles its really impressive I think she is very skilled. This is coming from a girl who has always absolutely hated to workout, going to the gym getting on a treadmill or eleptical and then making up some random weight lifting exercise that always seemed like agony to me I would be counting down when I would be finished. The cardio and mat workout are like an 1 hour and 40 min but the way I look at it if I dragged my butt to the gym and worked out it would be that long round trip. Plus it is in my home no more excuses for me. The video is high intensity like I said your muscles loosen within 10 minutes and there are periods that are less intense the way she hits muscles from so many angles sculpts your body keeps your heart rate up and you will sweat. Running in my opinion is very high intensity and you never get a break you are just pounding your feet and ankles and knees constantly. I went to Las Vegas for 4 days and walked and did the eleptical while there and that type of cardio if you are trying to sculpt is not going to get it done. Tracy is about 5'0 tall like me and she has such a fit figure, I am glad I found something I like after being inactive for so long my boyfriend can tell a difference already and has increased his workouts as well. As with everything you have to find what works for you! Like the title says you have to be patient and really take the time for some reason I did not become frustrated with the video I don't think its impossible anymore. Nothing is for free you just need to decide that its a priority. Hope this helps!",1259712000,4,2566,4.003898635477583

3563615,3,B001F2JVSO,I enjoy doing Tracy's Matt dvd every other day but the Cardio dvd is a little too advanced. I do other cardio dvd's by Chalene from Beach Body that are challenging and less technical. I wish that Tracy had varied the routines to include some fun routines that are a bit less technical along with the more technical routines that you can eventually build up to. The bottom line is it is difficult keeping up with Tracy on this dvd as she is a professional dancer. I will probably do the breakdowns of the routines but it will take a lot of practice and many months to do the routines along with Tracy. This can be a bit discouraging when you're trying to get your heart pumping and you don't really want to be so focused on foot work which slows you down. Good for all of you who posted that these routines are easy. I didn't find that to be the case for me but I will perservere and keep trying!,1258329600,,895,4.209302325581396

I wasn't used to a workout video that was comprised of such creative, very modernized dance steps. So I went at it the next day and made it through the end of the choreography. Now it was time to perform it following her from behind without cueing. It took me a few goes, but let me tell you, it's worth the patience and practice to learn the steps and perform the dances. It requires alot of jumping, hoping and spinnning around with one leg so make sure you have limber knees and ankles.

3563618,5,B001F2JVSO,I love this DVD!  Wish I would have found it sooner.  The DVD offers a break down of all the combos so you can rewind and repeat over and over until you have them down pat.  Your not going to get them right of the bat so take the time to rehearse and then perform.  Anyone can do it if your willing to learn!  You don't have to be a dancer.  Let Tracy teach you.,1256774400,,362,3.76
3563619,3,B001F2JVSO,"I'm a 30 year old, in-shape woman who had no injuries before. I've had this DVD for 10 months and have been exercising with it regularly (3-4 times a week) until I started feeling pain in front of my shin. And my shin was very sensitive to touch. Since this was my only workout, I thought it might have caused it and I stopped doing it. I was feeling great after a few weeks (no more pain) and started this DVD again. Guess what, a few weeks later, same problem! I stopped doing it again and the pain was gone. This is a great cardio workout and you burn a lot of calories (that's why it gets 3 stars) but I think it's high impact on your legs and joints. I've done latin dancing for 6 years (which is also pretty intense on your legs) but never got injured. So, beware and listen to your body! I don't think it's worth hurting yourself, I'd suggest other dance cardio DVD's that will not cause injuries.",1256688000,,904,4.2011494252873565

3563621,1,B001F2JVSO,"I had read all the reviews and thought that the bad ones were just people that hadn't put in enough effort, but believe me I've tried really hard.  I still cannot master the first dance, and I tried for over two weeks.  When Tracy does the dance at the full tempo it just doesn't seem to match the moves that she had broken down for you to learn.  They're only small differences and I'm sure someone with better dance experience or more co-ordination might be able to do them.  I think if one could master the moves it would be great and therefore I am truly dissapointed that I haven't been able to get to grips with it.

However I also have the mat workout and her post pregnancy dvd and they are both brilliant.  Obviously they're not cardio, but they are really good at toning your trouble spots.",1255392000,4,800,4.3355704697986575

My verdict: I really like it.  It's not for everyone though.

If you just want to put your workout DVD in the player and follow the instructor's commands, then this DVD is definately not for you.

However, if you are prepared to put effort into learning routines then you will probably enjoy it.  The start of the DVD she goes through each dance combination step by step.  Basically you can just keep rewinding and playing back until you get it.  When doing the main workout she doesn't call out the next step or instruction - therefore you need to have spend the time learning the routines.

The routines do take some time to learn, but with repetitions you will get them down pat.  I have some dancing experience but not a lot.

I like it because it's a bit different and fun to do. It's pretty high intensity cardio.",1254873600,,1010,4.370967741935484

The music is great and the surroundings on the set are beautiful.  I find Tracy to be a pleasure to listen to as I am not constantly being shouted at.  But, if you have minimal to no dance experience, it takes some time just to master one dance sequence, much less all eight.  If you are expecting to ""pop"" in the DVD and be able to immediately work out, try again.  I'm hoping that I can get all of them down.  But I worked on one of the sequences today for nearly two hours and still didn't have it completely down.  And I'm not completely uncoordinated either.  I found it somewhat discouraging, especially since I am so eager to have a body change.  Hopefully, it will get better....",1253059200,,815,4.452702702702703
3563625,5,B001F2JVSO,"So I felt the need to write this review because I was so completely confused on weither or not to purchase this DVD based upon the reviews I read (Amazon, Internet, etc). I did a lot of research before buying this workout as all the comments were very mixed, some liked the workout others dispised it. I would like to defend Ms. Tracy Anderson and her workouts, they are amazing. I personally have never had results like this before with any of the other workouts I've done, or have seen results as quickly! I started with the Mat Workout several months back, and of course, fell in love with it. My body was already changing into a leaner look by doing just the Mat exercises, but you need to have cardio to get maximum results and do be healthy in general.

So after much deliberation, I purchased the Dance Cardio. It does take work, there is no denying that. BUT, it takes the same amount of work that you would give to most cardio workouts. There should be some time taken to learn the dances, because after all, it is a dance workout so there will be some routines to memorize (this is common sense which many reviewers seem have been puzzled on or have not taken dance classes before).

I would like to say that I am not a professional dancer but grew up dancing when I was younger, so there have been several years where I was not taking professional lessons. You do not have to be a dancer to understand this video, you just have to have the slightest bit of rhythm and be willing to put a little time into learning the dances. It will take a few times before you can keep up with Tracy as she does go fast and throws you right in. BUT this is a good thing, as this video was made for you to grow with and will keep you from getting bored and throwing it into a pile of junk.

Honestly, I don't know why some of the ""professional dancers"" have so many issues with this video. If the masses can dance with Tracy why in the hell can a seasoned dancer not get it? There's some irony there (or again, lack of common sense).

In conclusion, this is a great way to get your cardio in (instead of running or doing basic, dull cardio forms), build a leaner body, and loose a bit of that extra weight you always wanted (I've already lost 8 pounds). If you are willing to put in the time, you can do the video. Hope this helps.",1252540800,55,2326,4.231981981981982

3563629,1,B001F2JVSO,"I am so bummed. I have the mat workout dvd and i LOVE it i've been using it for almost 2 months. I wasn't sure about her cardio dvd at first but after reading some great reviews and since i have now become a HUGE fan of tracy i decided to order it last week. And so anyway, i got it in the mail today, i was so excited! And so as soon as i got it i opened it and tried playing it on my dvd. It didn't work... i thought it was weird since it had never happened before. I thought ""maybe there is something wrong with my dvd player"" so i tried a different dvd just to make sure. The other dvd worked fine. I thought maybe i need to clean the dvd... i did and it still didn;t work. I tried playing it on the other 2 dvd players in my house. It didn't work on any of the 3. Finally i tried playing it on my computer. And that is when my computer informed me that i had just entered a blank dvd!

Thats right! I got a BLANK dvd in the mail!

I'm so sad because i REALLY want the dvd but now i'm scared to order it again... what if i get another blank dvd?
I don't know what to do!

3563631,4,B001F2JVSO,"I was very hesitant about this video.  I have the Mat and the Post Pregnancy Workout, both awesome.  Love them!  I read so many mixed reviews about this video and I am a RUNNER, really just like to to run and an occassional bike ride.  So, I was not going to buy this video.  However, a friend let me borrow it, so I decided to try it out.
Okay, first day resign yourself to hearing no music and just learning her choreography.  This took me about an hour and a half of doing the moves slow motion followed by up to tempo, a little boring, but I felt like I needed it, because, again, I am a runner, not a dancer.  The next few times I went straight into the music part, which has - NO CUEING.  So, if you are not willing to learn the boring part, don't even bother with this.
I have been doing this video about twice or three times a week for about 3 weeks now, and can do the whole video.  I wouldn't do it in public, because I am sure I don't look graceful and svelte like TA does, but it is a good workout.  I am a little grounded from running during the week until my older child gets into school next week, then honestly I will probably go back to running more than doing the video.  I have a toddler that goes in the jogger.  However, days that the weather is just too yuck, or the little one doesn't feel like going out for a jog, I will defintiely use this video.  It is a great workout, the ONLY thing I can do at home that comes close to intensity of a run.  It also really works my calves, which I like. So far, no problems with injuries, which was a concern for me, because I don't have the greatest knees.
So, I guess the bottom line is, you can do this without dance knowledge or coordination, but you HAVE to put in the time to learn the moves at the beginning of the DVD, take as much time as you need, you will still work up a sweat, and once you get to the music it is fast and doesn't stop. I do recommend some dance sneakers, I got mine on Amazon, you get the air cushioning, but the bottoms allow you to turn (a little hard in running shoes:).  Oh, and lastly there is no cool down, which still horrifies me, her other two videos have it.  I keep thinking I will find it on the DVD one day.  So please, do the warm up again at the end as a cool down, might cut down on some of the injuries people are experiencing.",1250553600,,2336,3.989247311827957

The dances were not too hard to learn within a couple of weeks and I love that once you learn the dances, you pop in the DVD and dance the entire time and don't have to repeatedly listen to the instructor re-teach the same moves and call the steps every single time you do the video because this would really get old after the 5th time you do it!  This is a great addition to my running/ weight training workouts that I was beginning to get bored with!  If you are already in decent shape and have some type of dance coordination- this is the DVD for you!  I would not, however recommend this DVD to my mother who is in her 60's as a supplement to her walking routine because it is alot of bouncing and spinning and I do see how someone could injure themselves if they were not already used to intense workouts!",1249603200,2,1244,4.1625
3563644,4,B001F2JVSO,"Tracy Anderson has changed the way that I exercise 100%. I started using her mat DVD 6 months ago and have all of her webisodes; I am a major devotee and have the results to show :) That being said, even with my dedication to her workouts, I have still yet to master the routines featured in the DanceCardio dvd. I blame my lack of coordination and obv not being a dancer, though I have master her treadmill dancing routines (FAVES!). I will not give up on DanceCardio though, it may be exhausting to learn, but even just trying to learn these routines is a FANTASTIC workout. Overall this is an excellent exercise dvd, it just takes a little committment, determination and lots of motivation!",1249516800,,693,4.552
3563645,5,B001F2JVSO,"I am a HUGE fan of workout DVD's because I much rather work out in the comfort of my own home. For about ten years I have been doing Tae-bo (I am pretty sure I have every series that Billy Blanks put out). As much as I enjoyed them, they all focused on the same types of moves. I needed a change. I saw Tracy on E! and was sold. I ordered her DVD's the next day (both the Dance Cardio and the Mat Workout). I decided to try the Mat one first. I thought I had strong legs (I run six miles a day) but after doing her leg series, I realized even though my legs were strong, they weren't strong in the right places. As for the arms, I noticed a difference in my arms in about a week. The standing abs take some time to get used to but all in all, this is a great workout. The Dance Cardio...definitely learn EVERY SINGLE COMBO before you do the routine. And when you are ready to do the routine, go to the Chapters portion and select Dance Routine Back. That way her back is facing you and it makes it easier. Be warned, she does each combo for 4-6 minutes each. You may think that isn't bad, but just wait. I love the dance DVD though, it is so much more fun than your typical workout and is one of the HARDEST cardio workouts I have done because of the way you are constantly moving and jumping. Every single part of your body is engaged. Even though I have never had a baby, I'm going to purchase the Post Pregnancy Workout as I have read reviews that say it is good for your mid section and has similar arm rotations and leg workouts as the Mat one does.",1248825600,,1554,4.016129032258065

3563647,2,B001F2JVSO,"I tried some of Tracy's other workouts (not cardio) and I really liked them, so I bought this one. I think it is probably a great workout if you are already a dancer or someone who picks up on dance moves easily, but for the rest of us she goes waaaaay too fast and combines too many moves in each section. I am pretty disappointed and plan on returning my copy",1248393600,,361,4.098591549295775
3563648,4,B001F2JVSO,The dances are difficult initially but once you learn the routines it's a super fun challenging workout. It took me 3 weeks before I could get through the routines but I did it. Can't do the dance workout every day though because it will take it's toll on your calves. I alternate between running/elliptical and dance cardio workout. Def recommend it if you've already been doing some kind of cardio and need to step it up a notch.,1248220800,,431,4.538461538461538

I still have a couple more sequences to learn...the dances keep me engaged and I sweat like I'm in a bikram yoga class. Give it a try!",1247875200,,364,4.185714285714286
3563650,4,B001F2JVSO,"I disagree with anyone that says this dvd is only for professional dancers or someone with some type of dance background.  I have a zero dance background.  I don't even dance in front of people.  I was able to eventually do this workout.

I agree with those that say you have to learn the dances first.  I think it took me like a week to learn them.  I believe there were 8 dances.  Yes, the dvd can be frustrating because there can be a lot of rewinding when trying to learn the dances.  I found it easier to learn the dances following the routine with her back facing me.  As she says that is the way you would learn if you attended one of her classes. I didn't learn the dances all at once.  It seems like the most I can do was 2 a day.  I would build up to learning more dances as each day past by.  After I got all the dance routines down and attempted to do the workout, I honestly was only able to do the workout half way the first time. It was the second time trying this workout that I was able to do the full routine.  Yes, I messed up when trying to follow the dance routines, but I forgave myself and kept going. I try to pick up on the routine where I can or just keep on moving til I can get going again.  You do sweat a lot, but just keep going.  Walk in place if you have to.  Don't worry about being prefect at it because I think eventually the more you do the workout the better you will get.

I have to say that from the chapters on the menu page of the dvd I choose the routine with her back facing me and I was actually surprised there wasn't a cool down after the workout. I don't know if the front routine has one cause I haven't checked.  I guess maybe she wants you to jump into the Mat Workout after doing this cardio workout.

Overall, I like this workout.  The songs are catchy, if you like that kind of dance music.  It's not easy at first.  If you are determined to learn it, you should be alright. Like I said, if you can't follow along, just keep moving any way you can. I have to say also that I was again surprised that for each song that played it was just one dance routine done over and over until the song was over, but to look at the bright side at least you get to prefect the dance routines every time you do this dvd.",1247875200,2,2259,3.973333333333333
3563651,2,B001F2JVSO,"You need a lot of space to learn and perform these dance routines. I had to lend this to a friend who can clear more space than I can. I don't know if she's tried it yet.

I'm a dancer and I found this DVD really frustrating because I had to learn the routines with DVD remote in hand rewinding over and over. The routines are not taught in an intuitive manner. They're taught broken up in strange places that make it tricky to get the rhythm. She teaches you the steps starting off one foot, then the other. Then she performs routine facing you and again filmed from behind. I found that when she's reviewing the routine, sometimes she'll only do it starting from one foot and not the other  - very unhelpful.

I thought it was smart of Tracy to film all the routines from two points of view so that you can choose to follow her while facing her or from behind - like you would in a dance class.

I certainly got the aerobic aspect of this DVD, once I learned the first 2 routines. Performing them got my blood pumping. I love to dance, so I think this would be a really fun way to get a good cardio workout.

My main criticism of the actual dance cardio section is that the music fades out when you're only part way through the second side  and then she's on to the next song/routine. Complete the dance on both sides, please Tracy!",1247443200,2,1334,4.211764705882353

If you are dance inclined it is probably great. I sent an email to her personal website and explaining my situation and asked for some suggestions but never got a response. I feel I spent $60.00 for the 2 dvds and would have loved some feedback. I was hopping the little people in this world mattered but I guess not.

But due to bad knees I have been looking for a good alternate. I am not a dancer and have had a difficult time learning the routines. I only have an hour a day to work out, so it's frustrating that it is taking so long. I feel like I am not getting a solid cardio workout and usually stop to do something else.

I do think if I could actually learn it more quickly, it would really give a great workout! So, if you are a dancer, give this a try. I think you will love it. If your not a dancer...be ready to spend a lot of time learning this.",1246665600,,754,3.986754966887417
3563658,3,B001F2JVSO,"I started out LOVING this DVD when it first came out last year!  After learning all of the dance moves (which took about a month) I was doing it consistently for four months and loving it. It's an entertaining workout and forty minutes of very intense doable moves that really motivated me to do it four times a week as she says (I don't have a dance background-far from it). While doing the workout I wasn't even thinking about when it would be over because I was concentrating too much on the moves! After several months I got a stress fracture on the heal of my foot, had to stop for a month, went back to it and then got another stress fracture on my other foot (the two within six months).  I was determined to get back to it but after I healed from that I got a knee injury from it.  I am not overweight and I'm very active (workout six days a week). I was very active before I started the DVD (running and lifting weights six days a week) and have never had an injury before doing this DVD. My physical therapist who I had to go to treat the injuries said that most women are shaped a certain way that makes them more vulnerable to these injuries and in conjunction with jumping for 40 minutes straight and dealing with fatigue from the intensity of the workout injuries are way more susceptible. Physical therapy helped build intrinsic muscles to handle the workout but when I recently tried it again I just had to listen to my body and stop. Regarding the knee injury, when I went to an orthopedist he asked me if I could touch my thumb to my wrist which I could and he said that there are many people who can do that and that those people are more susceptible to knee injuries due to the hypermobility of the bones and joints.  You can test it out for yourself whether you are more susceptible to knee injuries. The jumping is not straight jumping jacks etc.- the jumps are from all angles with various body positions. By the way, TA's mat routine DVD is really great.",1246406400,7,1978,4.309139784946237
3563659,5,B001F2JVSO,"So I borrowed this from a friend who had said it was too hard for her to follow thinking sure why not, I'd give it a shot. Later I found out that she'd only tried it maybe twice, so no wonder it was difficult for her! I'm a mom to a 3 year old and a 1 year old, so like other people, I have had a hard time trying to make room for exercise from day to day. With that in mind, I am telling myself that exercise HAS to be a priority because without a healthy body and life, I can't be the best mom for my kids. I decided that I would do this after they go to bed to get the best benefit from it and no interruptions (unless there's a nightmare or something that means they need mommy).

I watched it through all eight combinations before I actually tried anything so I had an idea of what to expect. You definitely have to go through the section where Tracy teaches you the choreography step by step. There is no way you can expect to just be able to do it with the music once the workout starts. With that said, I actually started doing the cardio dance workout tonight and didn't even make through all eight exercises. I only made it through the first five before I had to call it quits!  I'll admit, sometimes I felt like I didn't know what I was doing, but just like she says, it takes some time to learn all of the moves. With practice, I think this will be a fun video to really learn and be able to do, but I don't expect that I'll be able to get through all 8 combinations any time soon. I gave it five stars because there is no doubt in my mind that this workout will do what it promises it will do after doing what I did tonight.",1246233600,,1637,3.9575757575757575

First, I was disappointed that the DVD I received did not work, but I returned it and ordered another.  The second one actually skips a little so, the quality is not great.  However, my major complaint is the difficulty in following her during the routines.  You definitely need to have at least a little bit of a dance background.  Also, it takes a long time and a lot of paying close attention to learn the routines.  It helps if you have a large open space in front of your TV/DVD player because she moves around a lot.

I love the mat workout, but Tracy Anderson wants you to do both in combination for the results she promises and recommends no other routines.  So now I'm not really sure what to do.

U have to learn the dance routines first which take some time. However once you do it a few times you build up to it, and her energy, and body keep you going, and motivated. No pain, no gain!

The excersise portion of this is the dances put to the music and it's fast paced.  I will definitly need to work on the moves for a while before I am able to do the video. Not everything is qued, but it seems easy enough to follow.  She includes a lot of ballet moves into the workout along with jazz.

Before buying, I had read the previous reviews, but I didn't realize how much floor space Tracy's dance routines would require. She choreographs about 5 different dance segments, with spoken instructions. Then, the viewer is able to watch her dance the entire segments to music. This part is nice because she doesn't talk, and so I feel encouraged to dance along, and to improvise if I don't know the steps.

I work out in my basement, and I don't have enough room to prance around as much as Tracy does. Most of the time during this DVD, I have to reduce my movements, and even to dance in place. The studio that is filmed in the DVD is larger than most people's spare bedroom! Though her studio is pleasant and inspiring to look at, I can't move around as freely as she does.

For improvement, I wish the producers of the DVD had separated the dance segments into chapters. I like some of the segments more than others, and I wish I could just skip to the parts I like. This is not a beginner's workout. The dance moves are not complex, but her dance music has a fast tempo.

That said, Tracy's dance routines are diverse and fun once you get the hang of them and I think it'll take me a long time to get bored from this workout. The routines are hard, but energizing!

Definitely spend the money to buy the mat routine as well - most days I do about 25 minutes of the Dance Cardio and then 20 minutes of the mat work. I alternate that with doing the entire mat routine alone. It's a nice combination, especially if you're sick of the traditional weights and step routines.
Also, my original Dance DVD had a skip in it and the company addressed the problems very quickly.",1241740800,,738,4.23404255319149

Isn't that related to genetics and other factors? Fine, work muscles in new ways but this is not the way to do it. Her cuing is non-existent, her choreography is awful and high-impact in many places and it's NOT fun. This video is just a stupid ego trip or something. She needs to take a lesson from the whole library of workout videos and learn of all the ways that this dvd fails. Plus, it's not safe. Her stretching is a joke, too. What a mistake I made in buying this. Spare yourself the $$.",1241654400,,645,4.295081967213115

You have to rewind over and over again to get the steps..I really wish it was done in chapters for each combo so you don't have to manually skip through...Thats the only thing I don't like about it,1241568000,,494,4.2105263157894735

It really is ground breaking and awesome as long as you are willing to take the time to learn the dances.  I struggled at first but now that I know the dances I am getting a much better workout than if I had someone talking and cuing all the time.  You can just listen to the music and let yourself go.
If you are serious about your commitment to your body then get this one.  If you are a beginner, don't have much space or don't like dancing much don't get it.  Also, this is high impact for those with bad knees.",1241136000,2,680,3.963235294117647

3563701,5,B001F2JVSO,I love this workout!!! It's very motivating.  The music is like 80's dance music which I love and because you're dancing it doesn't feel like a traditional workout.  You have to put in the time and learn the moves so don't skip the intro cause it's well worth it.

3563703,5,B001F2JVSO,"I've been reading through these reviews and am really shocked that so many people give up because they can't memorize the dances right away...

I started this workout two weeks ago. It took me TWO DAYS to memorize THE FIRST combo (there are 8) - now I can do the first combo in my sleep.

It took me an hour to learn the second combo. Now I can do the second combo in my sleep.

The third took me 20 minutes to memorize.  And the fourth was even easier. Now I have the first five combos memorized and plan to work up to the last three in the next few days.

I am uncoordinated and a TOTAL BEGINNER and 100% out of shape. When I first started, I felt like I was going to die after 2 and a half minutes. The next day I made it to four minutes.  Today I hit 25 minutes. And good God, IT IS FUN!!!!  I still have a long way to go, I think the whole workout is 45 minutes long - I'll be SO PROUD of myself when I get there.

SET GOALS FOR YOURSELF, DON'T GET FRUSTERATED! She's adorable and totally fun - the moves AREN'T that hard and the ones that are, well, you'll love them more once you actually DO get the hang of them!

I'm down ten pounds in two weeks.

Buy this and DON'T get frusterated when it takes you two days to get the first combination! Your brain gets accustomed to memorizing dance combos after a few days and they get way easier to memorize.",1240876800,101,1356,4.007434944237918

3563705,1,B001F2JVSO,It took less than 5 minutes for me to be convinced that this was not the exercise program for me. Anderson shoots out a long series of moves that only a professional dancer or a person with a photographic memory can follow. She does not explain how or why these moves help you. People who buy work out videos do so in order to get fit. They do not spend their money to memorize ill-instructed routines.,1240358400,,402,4.302631578947368
3563706,1,B001F2JVSO,"This is my first review to ever post, but my first thought after doing this video was, ""Someone has got to stop people from wasting their money.""
The chick looks awesome..clearly in shape. So you think, ""sweet! This girl looks like she knows what she's doing."" She actually does, which might be a downfall. Not a good teacher. I love dance, my  mom was a dancer, and I have taken quite a few aerobic classes. I know how to move, and this video was fun for like the first 10 minutes. It was like craming for a test and having to learn all the information the night before. She teaches you 5 routines..which I forgot the first one by the time the third one started (and laughed out loud when she started on the 5th..).
Then she just starts dancing to the music w/ no instruction options whatsoever. The moves are fun, but like any dancer knows, looks different up to speed than in slow motion. It was hard and not very fun when actual work out time started.  I don't think this is a good idea for..well anyone unless they really want a challege. (Not in the can-you-tough-it-out kinda way, but the good-luck-learning-it kinda way) This is the kind of video that makes you give up in the middle of trying. Not good for workin the body.

I am a mom of 2 young children, so I was hoping to find a fun workout that gave me a lot of bang for my buck.  I hesitated to buy this because of the cost, but bit the bullet and went for it.  I also bought the mat workout, which I still haven't received...that was almost 2 weeks ago.  I got the cardio workout right away, so I was so excited to try it.

The intro section was even too hard for me to follow.  I could probably manage this workout if she performed the steps as slowly as she does in the teaching section.  Once I switched over to the actual workout, I just had to laugh out loud at how fast she was moving.  The choreography is way too difficult for someone like me who has limited dance experience.  I know that people have said it takes time, but I truly don't have lots of time just to learn the steps before I could even think of actually doing the workout...it would take me MONTHS to learn these routines.  Not to mention, she doesn't talk you through the steps at all during the workout.  I think that would have actually helped me out a great deal.

I wish I had listened to my gut and hadn't bought this.  It is for sale on Ebay if anyone is interested!  I am just going to continue with yoga...the best workout of all time...oh and it's free!",1239667200,,1342,4.091954022988506

She does a great job breaking down the routines, but you have to practice practice.  The mat workout is a little bit easier to learn (not easier on the body by any means)If you like to dance instead of running on a treadmill this is the workout for you.  The music is really different too (kind of like Madonnas techno pop-electronica-new age) I think its great.  It definitely makes you sweat",1239494400,2,511,4.761363636363637
3563723,4,B001F2JVSO,"The routines presented are approximately 8 counts of 8 over and over, just switching feet. They are not difficult, but can be challenging to remember if you are not a dancer...I have both taught and taken dance classes, and this dvd reminds me exactly of most of the dance classes I have taken.  I love doing the routine from the back, as that is how I learned at the studio.  You know exactly which foot to step on at what time.
 I recommend doing one routine a day until you master it, then moving on.  Once the routines are learned, I like being able to just run through all the dances, much like a show.  If you are just a club dancer or dance for fun, you probably won't like it...but if you have taken dance you probably will. This is a very vigorous workout, you will be breathing heavy and sweating.  I really like how she doesnt cue you constantly, but if you are used to hand-holding in your exercise regimes, you probably won't like it.  I give it 4 stars because I personally think it is great, but not for everyone.

An side note: There are many review of Tracy and her personal problems online.  In particular one from a former partner, some of which may be true, some of which I don't believe.

FACTS:
Lost 2 inches off my bust, waist and hips in 1 month of doing this combined with the mat 6-7 days a week as she recommends. I was also restricting my diet to 1200 calories a day and eating only fruits, vegetables and nuts.
It's a great workout but is very intense. I would not recommend the cardio if you have any kind of knee problems as I do not  and mine were killing me for the first 3 weeks due to all of the jumping and hopping that you are required to do in all of the combinations of dance.

But the point is - it gets my heart pumping and I sure do work up a sweat. I've only learned the first 2 dances and I know this dvd will keep me challenged for many months  - probably years to come, so it's fantastic.

I can't even imagine getting through the entire dvd without resting, but it's given me a goal to work towards.

Trouble is if you aren't coordinated and dancing isn't your thing don't buy it.  It is all high energy dance routines and it makes you work!  You also have to really learn the routines and it takes quite a bit of room in front of your TV, not for the very small living room.

I live in NYC apartment and even after moving some of my furniture out of my living (which is a decent size), I still find it hard to move adequately enough to do this workout without getting frustrated. It is a great workout if you have the patience to learn the dance moves first and have enough space. I have the mat workout as well and that requires far less space to perform those moves.

3563743,5,B001F2JVSO,"I love this because it is challenging mentally as well as physically!!  For an exercise DVD, this type of workout is long overdue.  It is not for uncoordinated people, or those who rely heavily on cues. I recommend this to those who have had some dance training in their life - even if it's just a little....otherwise, you will feel extremely frustrated.

I did the breakdown/instructional part of the dvd (with her back to me) for two weeks - 3 or 4 days each week.  Each day, I started at the beginning - taking as much in as possible.  By the 3rd day, I did the run through of the first three with minimal mistakes... so I began concentrating on the fourth. I took a couple days off - but I would run them through my head...that really seemed to help them sink in. I did this when I couldn't sleep, so it was killing two birds with one stone =)  The second week I started with the fourth, and things seemed to click faster than the first week.  I was able to learn the remaining dances over the next 4 days. There were a couple days that I did this for 3 hours...I had no idea I was working on it that long b/c I enjoyed it!

The third week, I decided to try the actual cardio workout.  I definately had my moments/mistakes, but just kept on going - she repeats the dances so much, I kinda wished I had started the workout sooner. You will need a bit of room to move around - not good for small apartments. I recommend doing the warm up after the cardio is over, she just stops and heart rate is HIGH - the warm up is a great cool down- especially if you enjoy the music (badassjackson).

One big issue I had with this was footwear.  I have wood floors, and trying to do this workout in sneakers caused me to twist my knees.  I ordered Bloch dance sneakers and now my movement is continuous/flowing, a much smoother experience =)

This is an excellent cardio workout!!  Give it a few weeks to learn the moves, and you'll love it.  You will sweat big time, and feel energetic afterwards.  I look forward to more from Tracy.  All the posts about her past are just silly.  We all have pasts,plus look where she is now! I don't agree with what she did but karma will come her way.

Yes, the steps are challenging to learn, but it's such a great feeling of accomplishment when you can finally keep up with her!

I saw Tracy Anderson on Oprah, dancing with Gwenyth Paltrow --having fun, looking healthy. I've had years of ballet training, I'm in good shape, and, I respect Gwenyth's lifestyle choices -- so, I bought the DVD. The method may be effective, but you've got to be able to learn the routines. It would have helped the presentation and been more professional to have presented the steps by name (either French, e.g., glisade, jete, or English, e.g., slide, change). Then, after allowing students to break it down with your back toward them [which TA does do], it would have been fun and effective had each routine been set to music as students ""perform"" up to speed. Instead, all 8 routines are presented first -- each one viewed from the front, the back -- slowly, quickly -- and without music. The beginning of the DVD (trying to learn the routines) feels like practicing calisthenics slowly while a coach counts from 1-8 over and over -- it's boring and it doesn't doesn't feel like dancing. I never learned the choreography  past the first routine. I tried skipping ahead to the dance portion (with music) but never having done the routines to music and not having the names of the steps called out, I couldn't keep up and never reached a cardio workout.",1237593600,10,1351,4.652719665271967
3563752,4,B001F2JVSO,Everyone who reviews this DVD says it's too hard to follow. That initially kept me from ordering it when I got Tracy's Mat Workout. I don't get why people say it's hard to follow. Tracy breaks down every dance routine several times. She shows you how to do the steps in small groups and then shows you how it looks from the front and then you can follow along with her when she show you how to do it as you watch her from behind. She constantly calls out the beat and which step you should be doing in the instruction portion. I watched and followed along the instruction part twice and then each day learned a new routine so after 8 days I could do the entire routine - not WELL as I don't have a dance background but I can still do it. You can choose whether to do the workout with Tracy facing you or with you watching her back. Do the routine from the BACK - with the complicated steps you need follow from behind. I really start sweating after the third song and - in terms of cardio - this is the most heart pumping workout I have ever done. The SONGS are really good and I would listen to them on my IPOD.

It takes a while to learn the steps properly in order to benifit from the workout.  I do not recommend this product unless you have a dance background.,1237420800,,271,4.4
3563765,4,B001F2JVSO,"Firstly, I am not a dancer, nor an active dancy type person.  I ordered both this and the mat workout.  This dvd is difficult to follow BUT, like other reviewers have said, I also recommend to take it slow and steady with this dvd.  It is hard to follow, but I am mastering each routine very slowley, but getting there and it is definately worth the money.

It is important that you take your time and really stay patient with learning the routines and have fun.  Even if it is one routine only to start with and then go onto the mat routine.  That is what I have been doing.  I also find Tracy enjoyable, she is not annoying constantly screaming her head off, if anything you actually feel like you are having you own dance class.",1237334400,,731,4.291970802919708
3563766,3,B001F2JVSO,I got this DVD along w/the mat workout and I have only done the cardio a couple of times because it was hard for me to pick up the steps but just trying is a workout.  I still mostly use my treadmill for cardio and once I get better w/the mat workout (which I love!) I'll try this one again.  I'm sure I'll get better at it the more I practice.,1237248000,,344,3.8309859154929575
3563767,4,B001F2JVSO,"This is a fun workout. Take your time, you won't learn all of the combinations in a day.  Actually this is something that I like.
You won't get bored with this workout quickly.  It is dancy, so if you don't like learning dance combo's then this is not for you.  It would have been nice if each combo was broken into chapters so you could go right to the combo you're trying to learn.  However, you have to fast forward to get there. Hopefully, Tracy will change this on her next Dvd.
Overall, I am glad I bought this. It is a nice complement to my other cardio dvd's.",1237248000,,567,4.174311926605505

3563769,5,B001F2JVSO,"After purchasing both the Dance Cardio & Mat DVDs and attempting to do them both, 5-6 times a week as is recommended, this is a no-nonsense work out for sure. Anyone who works out that hard (almost 2 hours!) is going to see results. I danced 10 years in my youth and was thrilled to get back into it for weight loss-that is until I rolled my ankle hard during the dance DVD, week two.  This was my fault for not warming up enough- I do think the warm-ups could be longer and stretch the muscle groups deeper-just pause it and stretch at your rate. For anyone who loves to dance, the Dance-Cardio can be challenging, especially if you're out of shape. Stretch deep, because once you learn the moves, it is fun!",1236902400,,709,4.330827067669173
3563770,4,B001F2JVSO,"I wanted to write a review from someone that had been doing Tracy's workouts for more than just a couple of weeks, because I feel like that was clearly missing from the reviews I have read in the site so far, so here it goes...

I mostly recommend this workout for people that have had some dance background or enjoy dance type aerobics classes at the gym or have done other dance workout dvds. If that's the case this is for you! If you consider yourself clumsy and not a dancer then really, what are you thinking? Find something else. So for you dancers and dance inclined people out there here's the scoop...

You are going to have to resign to the fact that this is a choreography oriented workout. However, this is not darren's dance grooves and she's not going devote the entire time to counting out and teaching you the dance because I think her point is you learn it and then just pop the dvd in and get straight to it. She breaks it down for you and I recommend you watch that part, but that doesn't really help you learn at all you'll forget once she starts at full speed. Use the format where she faces away from you. For sanity's sake the best way to learn this dance is to take 1-2 dances a week and learn them by just trying to follow along. So do warm up do two routines then stop it and go to the mat workout. Yes you will mess up but if you've gone to any dance class you know the key is to keep moving and then jump in again. She repeats the same choreography over and over throughout the song just switching sides so eventually it sinks in. After six weeks you should be able to get through six dances and some of you might linger here because after dance six it gets a bit difficult to get through all of this. That's ok eventually add the last two. By this point you will realize that her lack of cueing is actually and advantage because it makes the video less irritating.

Also, I must state that this is a bit of bouncy workout so if you are not a runner or a jump roper your calfs might not be ready for this. From my time doing this I have found that if you give yourself more than two rest days your calfs will get even more sore on the second day but doing the dance helps release some of that lactic acid so its best to just keep doing and eventually your calfs will be up to it. Also, some parts where there's a lot of jumping (plie-jacks for example) you might have to substitute doing another move in order to manage getting through the routine. This is a good rule of thumb if its too hard move from side to side or do something simple for that move and then get back in the routine until you build up the stamina.

What's the catch then? Well, it is hard to do both workouts 5-6 days for a total of two hours a day. Who has that time? So if you go for this goal you will not keep it up and your money will go down the drain cuz you'll shelve this dvd in no time. But in the beginning just alternate them each day for five days. I wish her mat workout had chapters, which would help only do legs one day and arms another. I fast forward (and catch my breath) and do this for a 1hr 30 min workout (skip her mat warm up after doing cardio, you are plenty warmed up). This works best for me and is worth trying.

Basically, the best way to lose weight is to do her cardio 5 times a week. If you can get through the entire thing and do the cardio 5 times a week for two weeks, while eating healthy (nothing drastic) you can lose 2-5 pounds in that time. Her mat workout is important though because working out your muscles not only tones but helps you shred more calories faster, not to mention I sweat tons doing her leg series alone. I have the mat workout and not the post pregnancy but I wouldn't buy both just buy one of these and save some cash. I'm sure either will get you slim in no time to start with.

Lastly, the music is not the best I KNOW but it helps you keep pace... just try not to think about it too much. After you get the moves down you can try them to other songs you like (mute tv/blast radio). Like she says, don't over think it, just get in your zone (kind of like running) and you'll be done before you know it.

Hope you find this helpful.",1236902400,677,4195,4.077575757575757
3563771,5,B001F2JVSO,"I love this video. Yes, it's hard to learn the sequences. She breaks the video down into instructions vs. actual speed. I took another reviewers advice and just played one instructional sequence a week until I got it down. I changed a couple of moves because of my knees and there are times she deviates her arms from the routine, so I do my own. If you aren't coordinated this video will be too difficult. I'm not a professional dancer, but I love to line dance. I sweat more during this workout than running, treadmill or anything else I've done. I've had it for about 6 weeks and still don't know all the routines. I also bought the post pregnancy workout and saw results within a couple of days. It's hard work, but totally worth it! Take your time and don't get hung up doing every little thing perfectly.",1236643200,,810,4.442953020134228
3563772,1,B001F2JVSO,"If you live in a dance studio and dream to be part of Chorus Line, well buy this DVD and good luck...otherwise, dont!

Too hard to follow, need a lot of space to move, the combinations are hard to remember and don't expect a lot of explanations.

Its for advanced dancers and still, i'm pretty sure they have some problems too.

I'm very dissapointed and its too bad that i cant have a refund because i would ask for it!",1236643200,2,420,4.225
3563802,1,B001F2JVSO,"This is the first time in my ENTIRE life that I am leaving a review on Amazon - after having bought dozens of books and dvds EVERY month for YEARS from here, I had high hopes for this dance cardio workout; knowing Madonna and Paltrow are followers of the plan definitely gives Anderson crendentials for those of us who would have never heard of her otherwise - but this dvd and peek into her technique leaves you feeling sure that Madonna and Paltrow ,... AND any member of the general public - would get just as good result with ANY other program, as long as the hours were put in.

For all of Tracy's schtick about ""my goal is to give anyone who wants it the body of a ballet dancer"", I have to say that the most annoying thing of all is perhaps the fact that SHE herself DOESN'T have one, - regardless of how in shape she is or how slim certain parts of her are.  A dancer, at BEST, in the sense of a backing dancer type peron/body maybe.... but never in a million years does she have anything even vaguely approaching the ultra lean strength and grace that top ballerinas have.  Her shoulders are really massive - in relation to how tiny the rest of her is, and in the way that ONLY someone who has at some point overworked out their upper body too much has.  Too strong, too muscular on top, and not ecshewing in the least that which she says she is.  Not the most important point - but niggly all the same.

As for the video itself; I will echo what another reviewer said; it is NOT a good setup, to show each combination of moves at the beginning in the way they are presented.  Definitely useless without ANY kind of music whatsoever, in the same way it is not only useless, but also totally unprofessional, for the workout itself then to have not one single, word, cue, direction, or even statement of which routine it currently is.

MOST annoying of all however, is how when it goes to the workout itself, the cameraman stays on her for a few seconds, and then pans and gives you a close up of say,... her calves.  Or her sneakers.  Or her abdomen.  I'd like to know how she ever thought in a million years when they were editing that this would be in any way conducive or helpful to the audience following this any better.  Indeed, all it does is ensure that you fall a further step behind if you don't already know the routine inside out.  And like another reviewer said; expect to spend at least 30 min on EACH of the 6 or so sequences of moves she presents.  Yes, this would be with no music, slo-mo, and BEFORE you can do ANYthing on the workout itself.

Lastly, I have to say that the soundtrack to this DVD, is - honest to god- , THE most APPALLING thing ANYONE could have ever put together.  First of all, it sounds like really bad, failed, pop,...but DATED.  I would say like failed 1991 pop.  Sample lyrics just to tickle your funny bone before you shell out for this; ""No I know what my rights are, I'm not in pre-school.  No one can stop me from moving my body, music connects me the feeling protects me....ooooooooo....oooooooooooooh"".  Please.

I'm so disappointed, I can't even tell you.  Because I really, really wanted to find something to LIKE. ANYTHING, to make it worth keeping.  But out of over 100 workout dvd's,... many of which are obviously not so outstanding,...this is the FIRST one EVER that is SO bad that I am getting rid of it.",1236384000,6,3368,4.33652312599681
3563803,2,B001F2JVSO,"I love the mat workout so I was excited to try the dance dvd.  I never got it too fast of pace, didn't feel like I got a workout at all.  Stick to the mat workout its great.",1236384000,,173,3.526315789473684
3563804,2,B001F2JVSO,"I am 26 years old, apple-shaped, and 5'3 with big calfs and arms, so I got this workout in an attempt to have that dancer's body. It's about 45min straight of fast-paced dance performance cardio. No wonder pop stars are so toned and skinny. It's hard to do that for 45 min straight. The only thing is they must have really good dance instructors helping them get the moves... This video is like trying to learn every move Britney does in her high-impact dance moves just by watching. It will take quite a while, but I guess it's doable.

I'm giving this 2 stars, because she doesn't cue you at all during the dances. During the section that she teaches you each dance slowly, you never actually do it to music two times in a row to get the feel of the transition. Also, when you do difficult transitions in slow motion, it looks and feels completely different than the actual real-time dance moves.

Great workout if you can learn it. I think I'll keep trying begrudgingly bc I want a dancers body. Let me know if you know a cardio workout that would give me lean calves and arms...

Her mat workout is awesome, though.",1236297600,,1119,4.422330097087379
3563805,2,B001F2JVSO,"I just got this workout after recommendations from another forum and an interest in something different than the grapevines, steps, mambos and other things that have made up my cardio workouts for the last 25 years.  Good thing I previewed it first.  It will take forever to learn the combos following the DVD as it is presented.  PROS:  Good production values, lighting, beautiful set, good music.  CONS:  Like other reviewers, I'm annoyed that she doesn't use a mirror or mirror cuing, and that the instructional sequence is bundled at the beginning of the DVD before the warmup.  By the time you get to the actual ""performance"" part, you've already forgotten what you've learned before.  Also many if not all of the moves are high impact and some of the turns look like it would make it easy to hurt a knee or ankle, especially for those used to low impact or running.  I'll probably end up just dancing along to my own moves and modifying like crazy, which is why I have to give this (very expensive) DVD a mediocre review.  I'll look into Turbo Jam, Hip Hop Abs or some other dance cardio to use with her other workouts.  The other Tracy Anderson dance DVD got much better reviews.",1236297600,,1186,4.6
3563806,3,B001F2JVSO,"I work full time, have an hour drive and an 18 month old.  This is a very difficult video to fit into my schedule.  I started to learn the first combination and got the moves down in about 40 minutes, however when Tracy brought it up to tempo, it was really difficult.  I think she might have added a step or two in there, so it's a little hard to do it fast.  I think the moves are easy and not that difficult in slow motion. I can see where, once you learn the combinations, it could be a good cardio workout.  I need to loose 30lbs of baby weight, especially around the middle and was hoping for something I could follow and get done.  This video is not it.  I will learn the moves, but save it for the weekend, if I have time. I ended up doing the slim and six series, cardio sculpt and cardio core, great 30 minute workouts...I just need plain cardio and don't want complicated 80's aerobics...hard to find.",1236297600,,912,4.177142857142857

If I had the time to learn each of these moves one by one, this would be a great addition to my regimen.  It simply is not realistic for most people's schedules.  It would take me an entire month to learn this if I did it everyday and then I would not be getting any exercise done because I would be spending that time learning dance moves in the broken down segment part of the dvd.  I recommend getting a different dance dvd like Bollywood Booty or Dance the Chakras.  Her other two dvds are awesome though, they are the best!  Get the mat one if you need more work done on your butt and thighs and the post pregnancy one if you need more work done on your stomach area, although both are an entire body workout.",1236211200,,837,4.12962962962963

3563809,4,B001F2JVSO,"I was looking around on the web for fitness ideas, and came upon Tracy's DVD.  Her physical appearance made me super curious as to the effectiveness and method that she touted.  She has (in my opinion) the ultimate fabulous body.  I purchased the video and have spent a total of 8 days on it.  The most important thing about her DVD is that it takes MANY days and much review to get the dance moves.  I have spent 6 days (one hour per day) reviewing the dance sequences before I could actually perform the moves to tempo.  I would say that I am reasonably coordinated, but have no dance training whatsoever.  They are real dance moves, and when done to tempo will have you huffing and puffing.  I know, that is the point.  Unless you are in terrific cardiovascular shape, be prepared to have to progress gradually.  I was in low to medium cardio shape, and I could only get through 25 minutes the first day.  If I can get to the full 60 minute workout, I will undoubtedly lose tons of weight.  It is an intense workout!  I crank up my iPod and dance along with Tracy.  Overall, it is fun and a great way to get in top physical shape.",1235606400,,1133,4.283018867924528
3563810,1,B001F2JVSO,"I was excited to get this video, I love to dance, what a great way to exercise right? Ummm, not so much. She said if you want a dancers body then dance. But she didn't say you had to be a professional dancer in order to do this video. I can follow choreography and am very coordinated - but his DVD made me feel like an uncoordinated idiot. The breakdown section has oh 4 or more dance routines that she teaches back to back- a lot to take in, the ""average"" person would require many sessions just to learn the steps. Honestly, you would have to practice this section alone for weeks before you could follow the actual routine. Then try it at the full pace- which looks like you are watching her on fast forward the pace is so crazy fast!! Unless you get the super fast moves down pat you are just hopping around with flailing arms trying to keep up. I have only made it through 24 minutes of the dance routine for 2 reasons, the routines feel too complicated add that to a super fast pace and I just feel screwed. I have to see if I can still return this video. But I'll keep her mat video and find something else I can actually dance to.",1235606400,,1139,4.158371040723982
3563811,2,B001F2JVSO,"I bought this DVD and Tracy's mat workout. I LOVE her mat workout and find it one of the best I've ever done. I got her cardio workout because I love to dance and thought, ""What a great way to lose weight!"" Well, I never expected the to have to learn 8 very complicated and difficult routines to follow before I could even dance to it! Not to mention the fact that one really needs a lot of room to do some of her routines. I noticed in the video that she is using Gwyneth Paltrow's own personal gym (I saw it on Oprah when she shared her workout with us) and I couldn't help but think while I was attempting to learn the moves how nice it would be to have a gym like Gwyneth's to dance in! Even after I moved every piece of furniture out of my living room, I STILL didn't have enough room to do the dance without hitting the walls and door.

My other biggest complaint against this video is that though Tracy's method is great, she doesn't do very well at teaching it. Even during the mat DVD, she hardly talks and doesn't cue when she's going on to another move. She barely takes the time to review each routine before she moves on to doing it at full tempo and when she does do it at full tempo, she doesn't follow the moves she just taught exactly and it throws one off!

I'm pretty upset that this DVD isn't working out for me and I'll be checking out other cardio DVDs as I know I really need to get my hour in. I'm not sure who I'd recommend this DVD to... maybe someone who is REALLY great at dancing, picking up routines, and who has a personal gym like Gwyneth's!",1235520000,3,1573,4.103896103896104
3563822,3,B001F2JVSO,"I've been using this video for about a month and find it that definitely works up a sweat and is fun to do.  She teaches you the choreography in the breakdown section.  Then after you've learned the choreography, you do the combinations set to music.  Each combination gets its own song and you do the one combination over and over again until the end of the song.  Next song--next combination.

However, I've noticed that she makes a bunch of dance mistakes in that she doesn't follow her own choreography.
- For example, in combination 2 she does extra jumping jacks.
- In combination 3 she makes another similar mistake in that she doesn't do enough jumping jacks and hops.
- In combination 4 she does the wrong move entirely--she was supposed to hop forward but she does leg kicks instead.

I bet there are other bloopers that maybe some other people can report.  Tracy Anderson is clearly not a perfectionist.  Come on, edit your own video!  Don't you want your product to be perfect and professional?

I have her strength training tape also, and I love it. You know it will work for you if you make the commitment to do it 4-6 times a week.
What I have to say about this dance cardio tape is I wish I could keep up, remember the movies. I am not a professional dancer yet I love to dance and do it often. I just find it VERY difficult to follow this tape. I really think you need to learn the movies in a studio from a live teacher and even then I would need a few classes before I would be able to flow threw it.",1235433600,,594,3.7983870967741935

I don't believe she was ever a professional dancer.

If you are looking for a quick cardio workout that you can just put in, do easily, and not have to think too much about what you are doing... this is not for you.  While the moves are not highly complex, it does take a few practice runs before you have the moves down (and I am a dancer).  However, if you have some coordination, and are willing to practice the moves a few days before you can actually get a good cardio workout in, then this is a fun way to get some cardio in your routine.

3563829,3,B001F2JVSO,"This entire video is extremely high impact and it's like jumping rope for 45 minutes, only without the rope.  Reminiscent of 1980's beat-em-up aerobics.  Of course a person would lose weight doing plyometrics for 45 minutes 4-6 times a week, because it develops fast-twitch muscle fiber, which burns a lot of fat.  High impact plyometrics done six days a week for 45 minutes also will certainly bring on the knee surgery so I hope you have good medical insurance.  Plyometrics are normally done only 20-30 minutes once a week as part of a balanced fitness program for weight loss.

There are less joint-damaging ways to perform the high intensity exercise to develop the  fast twitch muscle fiber so important for serious fat loss.  I highly recommend cardiologist Dr. Al Sears' book and dvd on his PACE program.  It's very educational regarding the most effective protocol for maximum fat loss and heart reserve capacity.  You can buy that on Amazon.  If you like to dance, I highly recommend Soul Sweat Dance dvd (available on Amazon), as well as Cardio Barre.  The Cardio Barre book is available on Amazon and the dvds for introductory through advanced level are available from their website.  Their personnel are very positive and customer service oriented.  For a comprehensive fitness and fat loss program for every fit or unfit level, I highly recommend the book Ready, Set, Go! Synergy Fitness for Time-Crunched Adults, 2nd edition, by Phil Campbell, also available on Amazon.  It's a step by step manual with abundant programs and illustrations.

If you are in love with this video, a more sensible way to use it for fat loss is to do one or two songs in the morning and another song or two in the evening, instead of attempting to slam through it at one go.  That keeps the metabolic rate high while minimizing potential body damage.  You could also use it as part of an interval training set, doing a song, then walking, doing another song, then walking, until your 30 minutes are up.  Then you can go do your muscle strengthening exercises.

If you have bad knees or ankles, or more than 20 pounds to lose, just use the instructional section extensively before going to the actual songs.  When you do go to the songs do it full speed, but modify it by eliminating the jumping and hopping.  The steps are done quickly enough while you're swinging your arms around that you'll still get a good workout.  IMO, it gets rather monotonous watching somebody continuously bouncing up and down like a circus performer or cheerleader.  However, Tracy does a good job of putting together step patterns to try to give you something to think about besides the fact that you're essentially jumping rope for 45 minutes.  Once you get familiar with the repetitious movements, you can easily dispense with the video and do them to music of your choosing.

She uses the same movements repeatedly:  Skipping front, side and back; hopping on one foot while swinging the other leg back and forth or back to front in a half circle; crossover steps; leaping from one foot to the other while swinging the other leg in back and repeating to the other side; high kick to front or side; and so forth, all while doing the obligatory hopping.  People who are upset about the complicated ""choreography"" are just over-intellectualizing this video.  It's not rocket science.

Technical:  There was one small scratch which caused a momentary glitch in the video but it's not worth it to me to send it back for that.  Shipping was fast, just a few days, no complaint there.  And yes, it could have been chaptered for each song on the dvd; perhaps Tracy will do better next time.  The music is good, I liked it.

I was extremely disappointed.  AFter going thru the 1st routine, I realized it was going to take me so long to actually learn it, without really getting any kind of workout before, during, or after I learned it, that it was simply a frustrating waste of time.  This gal doesn't cue worth a flip, and changes moves at any given moment.  There are never repetitions for you to really get the move down and then put some intensity into it.  I stammered around on the 1st routine for 30 minutes and never broke a sweat.  So I switched over to my Turbo Jam DVD and got my butt whipped as usual in about 40 minutes of non-stop cardio moves with good instruction.  If you want to do a great cardio dance-type class, keep moving, and burn lots of calories, checkout the Beachbody.com DVDs, or Billy Blanks.

3563873,5,B001F2JVSO,"Tracy Anderson has created an excellent workout for anyone who loves dance. I agree that if you're uncoordinated or lack rhythm, this would be a difficult workout and perhaps not the best choice. There are lots of fun, more straightforward exercise dvd's out there. But this is a great workout if you're willing to put in the time learning the combinations.

Most people expect to pop in a new dvd and get a great workout the first time around...that is probably not going to happen with this dvd for 99% of the population. I did the entire practice session, followed by the actual cardio routine, three times over a week. You will most likely need to practice the instructional portion several times--not just once. If you get frustrated just remember it's going to take some time to get it down. I would also recommend doing the workout several days in a row when you first begin so that you don't forget the routines. Once you've gotten it down, you can obviously take breaks from it.

This is a fun, challenging workout...I definitely recommend it!",1233446400,2,1052,4.711956521739131

The combos are not difficulit. Once you learn the first one or two the other seem easy and they are. I've covered 6 of the songs and now i have to learn 7 and 8. Honestly i didn't think this would work. I'm a retired volleyball player - i have an athletic type of body, meaning when i go to a jym and workout i build muscle. Before puberty i was skinny, but after i starter gaining wight and was hard to loose it. I've never been over 59 killos but i'm not that tall so it didn't look good to me...i have tried dieting and regular jym, but results were never what i wanted - so when a friend went to the US i asked him to get the Dance DVD - i live in a small small app, but found the space. I'm dancing for three weeks now - the results are amazing - i see my body changin and i'm happy - ALL my friends are asking me what the heck did i do to change so fast. I ordered the Mat workout - while waiting i did Tracys workout that i've seen in videos on YouTube or her site. Yesturday i got my DVD - great workout - easy to follow once u know her style - she explains enough - overall - for me it really works...i haven't stopped eating",1233360000,,1305,3.801470588235294

I like the Mat DVD for the arms section and the leg section thought the ""standing"" ab section where Tracy is dancing without any instruction is strange.  This dance DVD is very difficult to learn.  I guess after a few tries I had the first segment learned but I found myself concentrating too much on what came next and was I doing it right to actually get a work out.  The second half of the video Tracy puts all the dance segments together and repeats them and she looks great doing them-- I truly envy her.  But for me to get to that level I would either need mirrors, a dance studio, and human instruction.

Regards to all,
Glynn Barber

It is quite interesting that both of you, Gwyneth and Madonna, have endorsed Tracy Anderson as a product and neither of you, with all of your resources, did any due diligence before doing so. I hope at the very least that this gets the attention of a few fact finders and attorneys within your organizations, before someone gets hurt and demands the studies and research materials trying to prove negligence.

I do not want either of you to suffer any significant loss or repercussions stemming from your association with Tracy and Eric Anderson.

I encourage anyone, everyone, to investigate these facts and the Realization's I have provided and attempt to discredit even one.

Do you realize the real story here is sad? A young woman, so warped, so insecure of her abilities and inabilities, that she resorts to trying to ruin the lives of philanthropic and caring human beings for the benefit of only herself.

Do you realize I promote the success of others as a way of life and I wish you Gwyneth, you Madonna and even Tracy Anderson, success attained legally and honestly and with integrity.

This isn't the place to go into detail about my journey while I've been associated with Tracy Anderson. This is a brief reality of a day in the life of one of Tracy and Eric Anderson's many victims.

3563877,5,B001F2JVSO,"First of all, I love this DVD!  But I see some negative comments so  I figured I'd comment on a few of the critiques.  First of all, if you are hopelessly uncoordinated, I would not buy this DVD.  The DVD consists of dance routines that are good to learn one at a time.  I'm not sure what the one review is talking about saying that it's so fast and you can't keep up or learn it.  Did you see the instructional section?  She breaks the routine down into short segments at slower speeds so you can learn them.  That being said, if you've never taken a dance class ever, I'm not saying you shouldn't get this DVD if you haven't,  but it helps.  You can't do this DVD mindlessly because you actually have to learn steps.  Once you learn one of the routines you can move on to the up to speed section with the music.  It's not really that bad, she keeps repeating the same routine during a given song.  It's a great workout and it keeps your interest and it's fun because it's dancing instead of just jumping on a treadmill.

Bottom line, if you have no coordination or if you don't want to think at all, do not buy this.  Otherwise, give it a try!  I really like it and I think her method makes a lot of sense.  If you are always doing the same rotations with your muscles (i.e. running, cycling), you are going bulk up those muscles from overuse of the same large muscle groups.  Dance cardio/aerobics is always providing different angles for your muscles, utilizing accessory or small muscles,  and I am sore in muscles that I didn't even know I had (particularly from her Mat workout too which is awesome).

Answer to how much room you need and hardwood floors....I don't think you need hardword floors but it would be difficult on high or thick carpeting.  You probably need a room or space at least 8x8 feet but you could make it work with slightly less by modifying some movements.",1232755200,3,1885,4.359195402298851
3563878,4,B001F2JVSO,"I just bought both of the dvd's (mat and cardio) a week and half ago, and I have actually done both of them every day. I really love it.  The dance routines are VERY HARD. I am a total beginner, but if you just focus on learning one routine per week--and be patient--you will really get a good cardio workout. I'm only up to the second routine, but if you do it like she says, 4-6 times/week, you will get better at the routines. It was so satisfying as a ""non-dancer"" to finally be able to keep up with her for a whole song. The constant challenge is really motivating; this is the first workout routine I've actually looked forward to doing every day! I highly recommend it.",1232668800,2,676,4.28125
3563879,5,B001F2JVSO,"I have to say I am really glad that I didn't look at the reviews before buying this.  I have to say the negative reviews made a few good points.

Mainly this is hard and yes it will take you a while to learn the combinations.  You won't learn the choreography the first time but I really wouldn't blame her for that.

I think it is expected that you'll run through the routines several times slow before you tackle them fast, hence why she doesn't call out the moves in the fast version.

As far as people who said it was overpriced I look at it this way, I spent about $30 a month when I had a gym membership and $10 a class when I took dance classes.  So if I use this DVD for a month and/or 3 times it has already paid for itself.  I've already ""made up for the cost"" so I'm happy with my investment.

That being said if you're looking for something you can just follow along without thinking (I used to be a huge step aerobic fan) I'd suggest something else.  But if you're looking for a challenge I'd go for it.",1232582400,,1016,4.065326633165829

I have a dance background and honestly, the routines aren't difficult (though some are kinda wacky) but there's no music while you're going through 40 minutes of walking through the routines.  For me, this reduces the value since it's the music that gets me going and makes it fun! Tracy herself doesn't seem to be having fun either. Maybe if she had Gwynneth or Madonna join her it would add some energy to the DVD.
All of that said, I would buy Tracy's oufits if they were for sale.  Very original.",1232582400,2,630,4.491228070175438

If you are curious about Tracy Anderson you can go to the Goop website and download a lower body workout for free.  I am giving it two stars because once you invest all of the time to learn the routines it's a decent workout.  However, I could have spent the time doing a much more efficient workout and going about my business.  I also think the price is entirely too much for what you get.  I googled Tracy Anderson after I received my workout because it didn't seem like she was that experienced.  There is a lot of shady stuff surrounding her business practices, I don't know if everything is true but it is interesting.

3563895,4,B001F2JVSO,"I love to dance and would take dancing over a treadmill or elliptical machine any day, so this video is great in that respect. Only problem is that since I haven't taken formal dance classes in 20 years - it's a little challenging to learn the routines.  You really do need to take it routine at a time and go from there.  Really work on routine 1 (which goes with song #1) get that down and move on to routine #2 and so. You'll still get a good cardio workout trying to learn it one dance at a time - it's very reminiscent of dance class as a kid where each class you somehow got tired after doing the same 8 count for an hour.  To me this video keeps my attention way more than going to the gym since it is something totally new and a challenge to learn and master the moves.
Bottom line: If you have the need to be able to master a workout after 1 time of doing a video, don't even bother trying this one unless you were a dancer most of your life. Otherwise, give it a whirl and good luck.",1232323200,,993,4.005050505050505

When it's 30 dollars for just this dance cardio, I think you're better off picking something else.

I found the Tracy Anderson workout hard and a little intimidating when you stare at her on the screen doing all the moves so easy, it is very fast so you've really got to learn the steps off by heart first.

I haven't had any dance experience but I have done a LOT of different exercise videos. This one is great because it is hard - never lets up - and it take awhile to master the combinations.
I first did the instructional for a week before even moving to the combos. That being said, it's still tough to put all the combinations together but that's also what makes it FUN. That means every time I come back to it I put a combo better together and it's not just going through the motions which most other videos become for me.
The key is not to get discouraged - keep at it. To me, it's fun to workout and learn new steps - that way it stays from being the same old video every time.
It'll keep you moving the whole time. i don't mind that there's no talking involved. I ususally try to master a video to the point where I can do the video and listen to my own music or audio book or even watch TV while performing it.
Don't give up - slow down for some of the combos if you need to. The other KEY thing that helped me is doing the cardio routine with her back facing me. Much, much easier that way I think.",1228953600,5,1217,4.075

The only caution I'd give is that it takes a lot of space to really do it the way she does. Forget it if you have a tiny apartment.

My other criticism is that during the cardio warm-up, Tracy changes what she's doing and doesn't verbalize enough what she is doing.  For example, you are stretching your hamstrings with your head hanging down (so you can't look at the tv), you're in that pose for awhile, then you glance up and Tracy's doing something else...What the ???  She didn't even say she was moving on.  I just feel she is not very good with details.  I noticed this in her Mat DVD, too (very frustrating in that DVD).

The workout is very fun! And I love the fact that she doesn't talk throughout the actual workout. I had been doing Jillian Michaels routine prior to getting Tracy's DVD's, and to be honest, after the first couple of weeks of Jillian I knew each word she was gonna say and exact second of when she'll say it. It became boring and I felt like I was in the army. Tracy's workout is very different and makes you feel like a woman! I feel sexy doing it.

It wasn't easy, but it is fun now that I know them, I would just learn one or two at a time and rewind it and do it over and over to get in my 45 minutes of cardio and now I can do the whole DVD. I do it about 5 days a week and the mat one like 2-3 times a week. I do see changes in my body, I am (was) a runner, about 6 miles a day, but I want the long lean legs instead of a bulkier runners legs (which are still beautiful) I just wanted the longer leaner look, like Tracy!

It may take some practice, but even if your execution is not perfect, you will reap the benefits.  My only complaints are that you cannot skip around from song to song and she skips a move or two in the beginning of the first combination.  It would be great if this dvd allowed you to navigate around all the combinations -- I learn each individually and then try it out after learning it.  If this is the 3rd combination/song then I have to fast forward through the first two - I can't just forward arrow ahead. Other that that, this is a very fun and rewarding workout.",1227052800,2,730,4.306569343065694

I've had it for about a week and i've done it every day.  I didn't think the combinations were too difficult to learn.  A great thing about this dvd is that you can learn the combos separate from the workout.  The actual dance workout is much better that way.  I really like Tracy alot and I hope she continues to put out more workouts.,1226707200,3,514,4.01980198019802
3563952,2,B001F2JVSO,"I've taken aerobic classes, dance classes, kickboxing and so forth all my life, and loved every minute of it....This Dance Cardio DVD reminds me of routines we had to endure in cheerleading camps in high school. I find this somewhat hard to follow, and having to think too much when trying to keep up with all of the dance steps was a real turn off. I gave the DVD away to a friend and she didn't even attempt to finish watching it for the same reason. The DVD is now being passed around among all my friends and seems like no one wants it. Additionally, having to move my whole entire workout room to make space, and I still don't have enough to accomodate for some of the moves was very annoying. I guess I need a studio like Tracy.
This would be great for a dancer who is familiar with step techniques, but not for the average folk like me who enjoys the good ol' fashioned, effective but simple routines without too many dance steps to memorize.",1226620800,,949,4.337078651685394

I am looking forward to getting her other DVD's.  I don't have a huge area to dance in and these combination's have been really easy to fit them in the size room I have.  This is definitely well worth the money.  If you are on the fence about purchasing it, you should!",1226448000,,401,4.2105263157894735
3563956,3,B001F2JVSO,"There are various pros and cons to this DVD workout.  One good thing about it is that it's not as hard to learn the routines as some people have indicated on here.  There are 8 combos, but each combo is one song, so you don't have to learn all 8 to do a lot of the workout.  If you only have time to learn a few, you'll still get a good workout in.  However, the actual workout is just crazy (no wonder you'll lose weight)!  Since the dance is so fast, after about 3 minutes I was drenched in sweat and dying!  I usually work out 5 days a week and danced for 19 years, and there is NO WAY I'd be able to dance like that for 45 minutes straight.  You'd pass out!  It's basically like doing a dance routine full out over and over again.  For those of you who have danced, you should remember how winded you'd be after doing your routine 3x in a row.  The instructional portion is still a good workout, so maybe people can start off with that.  But I'm thinking I can do the actual dance for 10 minutes MAX and will need to get on the elliptical.",1226361600,5,1043,4.014563106796117

Though the dance choreography is not easy to learn and does take time, it's well worth it. It's a great workout that doesn't take all that much space to do. Skip through the breakdown where she  does the routine to the front--the sections where she faces the back is much easier to follow. It's well worth the money.",1226188800,,423,4.3544303797468356
3563960,3,B001F2JVSO,"Despite the choreography tutorial in beginning of tape, the lack of instruction during the intervals makes it very hard to follow and ultimately, hard to stick with. In a class the instructor reminds students what to do next like double knee right side. There is none of that here. It takes a lot of endurance to get through the intervals and you need ample room to move around, I like the matt video better and do it frequently while doing something else for cardio.",1226188800,,467,4.571428571428571

I am going to keep practicing and hopefully I'll get it. To anyone looking at this product- it is not a dvd that you can just throw in and workout to. You have to watch all the preview moves and practice them several times and then when you do the video you will need to practice that seveal times before you feel like you are really using your time to workout.",1226188800,2,527,4.176470588235294

It's amazing the stamina you need to get through this workout.  It seems as if it would be easy, but it's quite challenging.  I also spin and ride 10 miles.

3563963,2,B001F2JVSO,"I purchased both this and the mat workout. I returned this one because it was a little too advanced for me. I put in the dvd and was ready to go but first you have to learn all her dance moves before you can actually exercise.  Also when you get to the part to actually workout, she does not talk. It is just music and her dancing the different moves so you need to know everything or keep watching to remember.
Again not for me but if that is your style of exercise and you are a quick learner, go for it.",1225843200,,506,3.9607843137254903

It takes a while to learn the combinations, but if you learn the first 3 and then do them and add another each day, you can gradually extend to the full 8.  My only complaint is that Tracy actually messes up the combination in song 4 and then again in song 5, so it is a bit annoying because you are hopping into jumping jacks and she is moving on. But on the whole it gives me a great workout. Because the learning takes time, she would benefit by making the learning the combinations part have chapters so that you don't have to fast forward each time you are tackling a new combination. Petty issue I know, but this disk is $30--make it perfect!",1225411200,2,720,4.294117647058823

In exercise I mean. A great compliment to ballet or yoga. I have gotten so stiff in my lower back from my day job so I have absolutely no interest in lunges with heavy weights or high impact bla bla bla to keep my weight down.

After 2 weeks I'm still trying to get down the first 4 dance routines out of 8, so should keep me interested for a while. Plus, I sweat more after 15 minutes of this routine than I ever did in 30 minutes on a treadmill. Definitely recommended for those who want an intense cardio workout and have the patience to learn some complex dance steps (well, complex for novices anyway).

Today was the first day I used the Dance Cardio video.  I watched it all the way through without actually trying any of the combinations.  After viewing, I watched the tape again and tried to learn Combination #1. At first, it was very challenging.  Since I am not a dancer, I don't have any of the conceptual buckets related to dance that I assume dancers must have.  That is, I imagine that when dancers learn a routine, they see the routine as a combination of patterns that they can identify and that the rest of us are not familiar with.  So, to compensate, I decided to create and write down my own verbal cues for the elements of combination #1 in the order they are done in: 1/2 circle, Plie, hop back, wrap, twirl, water hop, paddle, Jacks. Once I did this, I was able to learn the combination very quickly. I practiced without the tape a few times, looking at my list of cues, until I got it down.  Then I visualized the combination throughout the day to further solidify it.  I started doing this with combination #2 as well and, again, piece of cake.  For those of you who are having trouble mastering this, I suggest giving this method a try.  It made all the difference for me.",1224979200,59,1391,4.440944881889764

I just started off slow, spending each session with just one or two combos and repeating them until I reached my 40 minute goal. Then, the next time I'd add another combo. I'm just an average girl with not a lot of coordination and I can do this video.  People who say it's too hard just don't have the patience that it takes to learn the steps. But, if you do and give it a shot you'll see it's a really great cardio workout that gets your heart rate up there and has you sweating like nothing else.",1224979200,3,734,4.311594202898551

If you have a dance background and are in shape this is a great workout for you; however, if you are not, just be patient with yourself.

However, I decided to stick with it and just do the review portion of the DVD for a few weeks and see if I got better. That alone was a workout for me.

It seems as if she is really just doing her own thing and if you are a quick study you can get in the game, but it is too easy to get frustrated with her method and her music is not good and I wish I could get my money back.",1224720000,13,529,3.8

This DVD was designed for the long haul, for a great workout that uses all your muscles -- IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO TEACH YOU ALL THE COMBOS IN ONE VIEWING.
The eight routines are unique and fun and I'm SOOOO glad she doesn't litter the actual workout section with instructions (don't you get sick of hearing the ""beginner instructions"" everytime you work out with other DVDs?).
Yes, it takes time to learn, but it's not hard IF YOU SPEND TIME DOING THE INSTRUCTIONAL SECTION (which is actually fun!).  Now that I've mastered the combos, I can just do the dances and get in a killer workout.",1224460800,2,814,4.348684210526316

I have been a professional dancer for almost 30 years now so this seemed like it would be perfect for me... So I ordered both of the videos.. the Dance and the Matt workout. There is a lot of cool things about this video but more importantly, I think the Dance workout is dangerous. No wonder Gweneth threw her knee out.. although I'm not sure if it was from doing this workout but I think it would be very easy to get injured performing this class. It is a great challenge just to complete all of the dances in a row and follow Tracey but this kind of workout is better done in a class with a live instructor and mirrors where you can see all angles as well as a proper floating floor to help you withstand all the jumping and direction changes. Tracy's cueing is not great either and that can be very frustrating as well as her constant pouting into the camera.
I am such a big fan of Karen Voight and The Method Pilates workouts with percise timing and cueing and a no nonsense aproach, that these workout DVD's left me very disappointed.
You WILL work up a sweat and the matt workout is great but I think you could do a much more efficient work out in one hour (rather than 2 with Tracey)with the same results if not better with Karen Voights ""Slim in 10"" dvd workout... as well as prevent yourself from being injured!",1224460800,383,1428,4.273062730627307

3563994,5,B001F2JVSO,I just got this DVD and learned the first two combinations. I haven't danced in years and find most workout videos boring. Not this one! The moves are very dynamic and the workout is engaging. Each count of eight builds to the next so that you have incentive to keep going no matter how tired you are. Wonderful workout. Great music. Can't wait to learn the rest.,1224288000,,363,4.432835820895522
3563995,2,B001F2JVSO,"Denise Austin or Kathy Smith fans beware............I am a healhy 37 year old who exercises regularly to fitness videos and I find this video difficult.  There are a lot of arm movements and holding your arms up which put a lot of stress on the shoulder and neck muscles.  I find myself tense and sore and I eventually end up with a headache from the over-strain.  I love music but I also find the choreography to be difficult to follow unless you have dance background.  Also, there is no instruction or calling out of movements, it is basically trying to follow Tracy as she dances along in her studio.",1224288000,4,604,4.513761467889908
3563996,5,B001F2JVSO,"This is a great workout.  Contrary to what others have said, I received all her videos on time and in great working order.  Thanks Tracy!",1223942400,,137,4.44
3563997,1,B001F2JVSO,YOU DON'T WANT THIS INLESS YOU HAVE SOME DANCE EXPERIENCE  THAN YOU CAN CATCH ON QUICK IF NOT IT WILL TAKE YOU A YEART TO LEARN,1223769600,4,127,3.8846153846153846
3563998,4,B001F2JVSO,I ordered both of her videos and first off I have to say that I am so uncoordinated! I have to date only learned the first combo and then started doing the 2nd one last week. I want to learn all of the dance routines down pat before going to do the entire routine. It is frustrating at times but even gwyneth paltrow said that it took her a good year (i think that is a little exagerated) to learn the routine to where she felt comfortable doing it! I think with more practice and repetiion I will get it down pat and I have to say that I am glad I ordered it because it get's boring doing the treadmill and all the other cardio equipment too!,1223596800,4,643,4.03125
3563999,5,B001F2JVSO,I just received this DVD about a week ago and immediately started learning the combinations. It was more challenging than I thought it was going to be but after repeating the combinations I am now able to do the first 3 dances up to tempo. I usually do this workout for about an hour and a half. It's so addicting and fun! If it wasn't so challenging I would probably get bored. There are two different sections of the DVD. The first part is where she slowly goes over the combos and the second is where you have already learned it and can get started. I love the music and the fact that she doesn't talk during the dance portion. I can't wait to master the whole thing.,1223424000,4,670,4.2421875
3564000,5,B001F2JVSO,"I am so glad I ordered this DVD!  However, there are some things you should know before ordering it, if you haven't already.  This is a tough workout.  It's unlike anything I've ever seen for doing at home.  I danced for a few years when I was younger but I see this is going to be very challenging.  That is what I find so exciting about it, though.  I'll be lucky if I master the entire thing over the next 2 months.  I'm taking it one or two combos a day over the next few weeks in order to learn everything, slowly doing them together until I get the whole thing.

I understand that some people will be overwhelmed if they are expecting something they can master in a few sessions.  If that is what you want, this isn't for you.  This is challenging and requires a lot of time and hard work.  That is what makes it so worth the money, though.  I don't expect to master this in less than 2 months time but when I do, I will be in the best shape of my life.  If you are willing to work for it, it will be the best 30 dollars you've ever spent.",1222992000,22,1045,3.9903381642512077
3564001,4,B001F2JVSO,I have been doing home exercise DVD's for a long time.  I mostly follow the Firm DVD's and recently started the Lotte Berk ballet DVD's (Kelly Rippa promotes those).  So I got excited about Tracy Anderon.  I got the DVD's last week and it's taking me forever to learn the first combo and to be able to do it to the music.  I am going to stick with it and keep trying it 4-6 days/week along with the mat and hopefully will get better at it and see results.  It's a hard workout and different from anything else I've done.  The negative is Tracy gives no cues.  I have to constantly look up to follow her and she's already onto another move. It's as if she's freestyling the whole thing-mostly the mat DVD. It's frustrating when you are trying really hard to get the most out of this workout.  Does anyone know the name of her other dance DVD and would they recommend it?,1222646400,4,869,4.2560975609756095

8300800,5,B001F2JVSO,"You have to understand Tracy Anderson philosophy before you can understand and enjoy her workouts. When I first purchased this DVD a few years ago, I thought it was just nonsense and jumping around,  especially when she said it will tighten your skin to your muscle. Yeti did put it to the test and did it 2 weeks straight, 6 days a week and the results was amazing. Yes I felt my skin,  especially around my stomach more firm and tight. It not just dancing, but she puts moves that actually targets specific muscles. When you first start, you will experience splintsplints a lot,  but don't give up. When I want just cardio,  this is the workout I go to and I do burn from 700 to 800 calories with me wearing a heartrate monitor depends if I take breaks during the dance session. I highly recommend it.",1510704000,,803,4.405405405405405
8300801,1,B001F2JVSO,"Extremely complicated . I am a working mom with not a ton of time on my hands and i just cannot justify spending the time to "" learn"" her complicated moves . Might be a good workout but i couldn't make it past the instructional video . I bought Simone de La Rue's - Body by Simone  Signature Classes dvd instead , it fits my workout style/ regime better . Another annoying thing with Tracy's dvd is the pouting in front of the camera . She really should consider targeting a different audience , i am a straight female just trying to work out . Need good music and a solid routine , pouting doesn't do anything for me .",1492300800,,619,4.158333333333333
8300802,5,B001F2JVSO,"I'm not very coordinated and struggle with holding a beat.  I hesitated in buying this because I wasn't sure if I'd be able to follow along. After doing the practice session twice and following Tracy in regular time 2-3 times I found it fairly easy to keep up.  I wasn't doing a perfect job of keeping up but I didn't feel lost at all.  I also wasn't very consistent in how often I practiced, maybe over a month or two. It was a very effective cardiovascular work out which I typically do not enjoy but I enjoyed this DVD. Give yourself a good amount of room to move around. I think I have 8 ft by 6 ft in my living room in which to freely move and it was enough not to bump into anything.

I'm in decent shape because of my build and genetics and I almost never work out. I found this DVD challenging but doable.",1485475200,,813,4.09433962264151

Do not like, period and end of sentence.  .  I,have not purchased anymore of her workout dvd's I just do not like her so I am of the opinion none of her workouts are good.  This one has 4 different step intervals.  She's does not teach the steps clearly, concisely, or for enough time.  Good luck getting the steps down.  It does not appear like it would be challenging.",1483315200,,393,4.22972972972973
