7580771,5,B019R8P2VW,I've been collecting these movies since the first one came out and I will until the end of the sixth generation!,1458259200,,112,4.380952380952381
7580772,4,B019R8P2VW,"I kinda enjoy this movie, overall. Retuning Legendary Pokemon gave memory chills. The Sinnoh Legend were my favorite, Kyurem was there, it'll be cool if that's the same one who talked over from Keldeo Movie. Arceus, which I was hoping for Battle against Hoopa Unbound, would've been Epic. I'm also glad that Hoopa VA sounded better for second try than the earlier that was in the trailer. So cute. But what went flaw that amount of time for this film was too quick, because of Pikachu short took away it's time limitation and disappointed that the trailer scene was never shown in this one. 35 mins of battling and had too much focus Besides showing other gangs screen time. And when Ash possessed, There was no Amourshipping  (Ash X Serena) c'mon. For all, I think it's a good film. Sigh",1457740800,,788,4.628571428571429
7580773,3,B019R8P2VW,"The movie was sort of overhyped. It has all your favorite legendaries like Rayquaza and Zekrom but that was it's main selling point, to show all of your favorite legendaries. And in the trailer it showed a clip with Arceus but that clip is not shown in the movie at all. The movie is slow and boring. Here is the summary of the movie.

Hoopa Unbound is like a genie pokemon with 6 rings, one on each of his 6 arms. He comes to a village, the village gives him food and everything he needs. He then in return releases legendaries in the village and fights them to prove his power. Then someone creates the prisom bottle and seals hoopa unbound in there and now hoopa is now in his cute form. There we leave off to Ash. Ash and the gang are heading to a city to go eat donuts(Ironicly they want a lot of ring jokes in this movie)and hoopa shows up and takes some food(Every Pokmon movie now has to make a joke about the guest pokemon stealing food)from ash and ash follows through the ring the gang makes it to the city through the ring and then the prisom bottle shows up and unbound gets released and posseses hoopa and it releases legendaries and then they fight for 40 minutes and that's the movie. Its not good",1457395200,5,1213,4.251082251082251
7580774,5,B019R8P2VW,I enjoyed this movie it was a great story and once again featured Ash doing what he does best being a brave young man facing any obstacle that comes his way and Hoopa was an interesting Pokemon and fun to watch and his story was nicely done......,1455840000,,246,4.25531914893617
7580775,2,B019R8P2VW,"As a keen supporter of TPCI dub of Pokemon over the later 4Kids dub (Advance Generation in particular) this was a bit of a let down. There was nothing wrong with the voice cast, they've all been fine for year, but my biggest grip with this movie is the music score.

For some reason since XY The Series, the English dub has replaced most of the original background music, As to why they've switched from having a good chunk of music from the Japanese score to barely anything at all is baffling. For the series and previous movie, the scores have been acceptable but in this movie, it is very bad. When compared to movies 4-16 which kept all of the Japanese score in-tact, this one sounds very inferior when compared to those movies, let along the Japanese score for the movie. And yet the credits still have the nerve to include Shinji Miyazaki, who has produced amazing scores for the movies and yet has to be associated with this dub's poor score. It's very off-putting when watching this film.

As for the rest of the film, it's not too great sadly. This was the lowest performing Pokemon movie in its homeland after the previous movie performed not so well before and the fact they've thrown in so many legendaries to get more attention shows it desperate act. Many of the Legenday Pokemon outside of Hoopa are just there to battle and nothing else. No story, no real connection to their previous movie appearances, just ""Hey look! It's the Pokemon from that other movie!"". Even Arceus, the Pokemon that created the universe and such only gets a mere 10 seconds of screen time near the end! As far as Hoopa goes, boy they gave him such an annoying voice, its pretty hard to sit through the first time watching and only bearable the second time. The story would probably have been okay had it not been for this huge problems.

Overall if you're a huge Pokemon, you'll probably see it anyway. The casual fan might want to just wait and hope this year's movie fairs better (And the fact it's screening so near to a One Piece movie in its homeland will no help matters) or for movie 20 when hopefully better treatment and more effort will be made.",1453593600,8,2148,4.5167095115681235

Then when my replacement came it was in perfect condition and it came on time. My little sister and I love this movie, my sister just can't stop watching it.

8745899,4,B019R8P2VW,"Lets be honest. If youve seen one Pokemon movie youve pretty much seen them all. Ash and friends come across a legendary Pokemon. They develop a relationship with the legendary Pokemon. The legendary ends up in a battle with a much larger legendary which takes up half the film and everything is resolved with the power of friendship. There are some pointless cameos from Team Rocket and inevitably we hear Ash say, Pikachu, use thunderbolt but in the end each film is pretty much the same and generally they are intended to tie in to a free Pokemon that can be downloaded when Japanese movie goers buy their tickets.

In this case the legendary Pokemon du jour is Hoopa, one of less than a handful of Pokemon I haven't captured in the game. Thanks Nintendo for making him available for half a second. It turns out that the protagonist and antagonist legendary in this film are BOTH Hoopa. The true Hoopa is a massive, incredibly powerful and somewhat aggressive legendary. However, a wizard of sorts manages to create a prison bottle that is able to contain most of his power leaving Hoopa very tiny and docile. This is the Hoopa that befriends Ash and crew. Unfortunately, even in the prison bottle Hoopas power can still exert influence and much of the movie is a no holds barred battle between the two Hoopas.

Legendary vs legendary is obligatory in Pokemon movie but in this case both Hoopas are capable of bringing in other legendaries to battle for them using their teleportation loops. In this respect Hoopa may be the most powerful Pokemon ever short of Arceus (the God Pokemon). The powerful Hoopa shadow ends up summoning to his aid Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Dialga, Palkia, Giratina and Kyurem. Anyone with even a modest knowledge of Pokemon would realize that that is a RIDICULOUS amount of power. Its one heck of a fight but I confess I got a little numb after awhile to the continuous attacks and explosions. There is no restraint in this one.

I think it would be marvelous if the Pokemon movies would actually try something daring and new but as always the film sticks to the series tight template. If piles of Pokemon battles is all it takes to keep you happy then this movie is for you. I looked up on Wikipedia and every film since number 13 Zoroark: Master of Illusions ($71.1 million) to this film ($22 million) has generated a smaller box office gross than its predecessor.  Even the film after this, Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel, has continued the trend earning just $20.2 million. They absolutely need to try something new and not create the same movie over and over again ad nauseum. As Pokemon movies go this one is fine and the animation is very nice but its as forgettable as all the other Pokemon movies.",1488585600,,2747,4.669421487603306
