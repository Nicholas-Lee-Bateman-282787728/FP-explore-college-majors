8419627,5,B004A8TCVG,Combining God and yoga! A dream come true. Wonderful challenging poses and praise filled music. Highly recommend. Such a sacred time on the mat.,1353628800,,144,5.041666666666667
8419628,3,B004A8TCVG,"I love the idea of Christian Yoga, and had great expectations for this DVD.  Unfortunately, it is not great.  The initial relaxation is way too long, and the practice is too short. The teaching is pretty good, although I had pain in my elbow after doing this practice, and that does not typically happen to me after doing yoga.  I will try this again, but it is not a favorite.",1315785600,4,377,4.357142857142857
8419629,5,B004A8TCVG,"This dvd is a great way to rid toxins... Its a challenging workout of a variety of yoga poses but the teacher guides you through each pose in a Christ Centered way,  It is awesome and the love I feel when I do this is amazing.  I do this dvd every other day and I do their gentle journey dvd on the days I do not do this one.
If you like to be challenged in yoga this is definitley a great dvd for that.
I absolutley love both of their dvds..
They open with a verse from the bible and end with the same verse, it helps me throughout the day to remember how wonderful our God is...  and they end with a prayer full of love and hope...",1308268800,4,633,3.853846153846154
8419630,4,B004A8TCVG,"This practice prefaces being intermediate to advanced in your familiarity with yoga. If you are new to yoga I suggest observing first so you can SEE the transitions and variations before practicing at your pace. Enjoy the serene settings as you are gently talked through transitions. This practice inspires and encourages you to challenge yourself where you are today with grace.
The finish is relaxing as it began with the meaningful encouraging Word. Make it your own and flow in the joy.",1296086400,,490,4.987804878048781
