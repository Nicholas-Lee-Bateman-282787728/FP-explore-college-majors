2582431,1,B000FQIRZ4,"It makes zero sense to spend $198 on this 6-season package, when buying the individual seasons separately would run you $106 at their current price.  Save $92 and buy them individually.",1220659200,18,185,4.967741935483871

2582437,4,B000FQIRZ4,"What can I say, this is almost what I was waiting for.  The only problem was that each season is individually boxed as if I bought them separately.  I was hoping for an individual box.  But other than that you have every episode of the series, including the Christmas episode, and something that was missing for years, the opening sequence following the credits that was always cut for time in sindication.  Still a must have.",1178928000,31,426,4.64

2582439,4,B000FQIRZ4,"This collection is GREAT and brings back fond childhood memories for my wife and I each time we watch them with our daughter who ALSO loves them.

Only a few complaints a few complaints are what brought my/our rating to a 4 versus a 5...

The set was marked as ""NEW and Sealed by Manufacturer"" though the boxes that contain the DVD's had some rubbing and bumping which made them appear as used or as having sat for some time and possibly moved around a little carelessly.

Haven't gotten through ALL of the set, but at least 1 of the disks from the first season does not have the animated artwork labeling as the rest.

Would have loved to have had the original commercials included with each episode to display as original.

With that said the Amazon customer service department took care of us and was very friendly and helpful to offer various paths of resolve in the two separate conversations regarding the issue(s) and made good as to a satisfactory partial refund and never gave a bit of hesitation nor disbelief.",1429747200,2,1020,4.582417582417582

2582445,4,B000FQIRZ4,"This review is for the Flintstons DVD Season sets.  I really enjoyed seeing these cartoons again.  Im not an expert on the Flintstones  so I can only review what I see on the DVDs.
I have noticed one thing about the shows that I had not noticed when I was a kid.  That is the loud annoying music that plays through nearly every episode.  Sometimes it is hard to hear the voices.  Tho I have noticed that on other cartoons as well.  I bought the season sets because they fit in the shelf.  I don't really like most of the fancy boxes they come up with for some tv shows.  Not sure why the first season had to have the flimsy plastic cover.  But it is what it is.  All in all a good time.  Brings back memories.",1399075200,3,709,4.057971014492754
