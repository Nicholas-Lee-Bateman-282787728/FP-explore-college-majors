8377258,5,B002PQQR5E,"Very informative and interesting series. I liked watching Billy and Sully considering all the invention ideas that came their way. Some were obviously not very well thought out, while others were hits. Even more interesting is the interaction and obvious competitive friendship between Billy and Sully, and the antics that result. Sadly, Billy Mays passed away just as the first season was ending. I was (and am) a fan of Billy's commercials, so I scored an unopened set of this series on ebay for only $5.99! Billy himself would have been proud of that.",1450656000,,554,4.904255319148936
8377259,5,B002PQQR5E,"This short-lived series was among the best shows on The Discovery Channel (TDC).

This 3-disc set has all of the episodes from the first season, with the exception of the Billy Mays memorial episode (the set had been released before Mays' death). There is also a gag/blooper reel, which is not especially funny, but is interesting nevertheless.

This set was available only from the network and was quickly pulled after Mays' death. TDC gave the green light to produce a second season of Pitchmen, starring just Sully, but without Mays, the magic was gone, and second-season episodes were not regularly televised on the network.",1308960000,,628,5.028846153846154
