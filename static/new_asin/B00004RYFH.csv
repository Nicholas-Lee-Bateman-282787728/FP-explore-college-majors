1345395,3,B00004RYFH,"UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE MINISERIES. THERE ARE TWO SCENES DELETED PRIOR TO AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST SUPPER. THIS GERMAN RELEASE IS NOT UP TO PAR AS FAR AS VIDEO QUALITY. MEXICAN VERSION, STILL CUT EDITION IS MUCH BETTER",1386720000,9,241,4.627906976744186
1345396,3,B00004RYFH,"Since many fans consider the Jesus of Nazareth TV Mini-Series released in 1977 to be one of the best films about the life and ministry of Jesus Christ you may be disappointed if you import this 4-disc German Blu-ray release. The total running time is 371 minutes which is chopped from the full 382 minute broadcast. So this is not the ""Complete Miniseries"" because some key scenes are missing (most importantly the beginning of the Last Supper). While the picture and audio quality are a marginal improvement over the DVD release they are fairly average overall. No bonus content is provided. A deluxe US Blu-ray with a good remastering and 3 hours of supplements is badly needed for Jesus of Nazareth. This is a 5 star film in a 3 star package. Ensure you have the appropriate equipment to play this Region 2/B release if you decide to purchase it in the US.

1345397,5,B00004RYFH,"I have to agree. Why is the best version of the story of Jesus (with the exception of ""The Passion"") being held up for Blu-Ray?? We are all waiting for this movie to be released and it would be an instant purchase for me.",1376784000,6,221,4.045454545454546
1345398,5,B00004RYFH,"It is way past due for this film to not be in Blu-Ray format. I have been waiting forever for it to be made available. what is the hold up? I can't understand why it hasn't happened. Finally, get it done. Please.",1365552000,13,212,4.071428571428571
1345399,5,B00004RYFH,"With the new mini series The Bible  receiving such  high ratings, maybe now Lyonsgate, the owner of Jesus of Nazareth, will finally make this movie available to the US market in Blu Ray. This is considered the best movie ever made about Jesus. It has an international all star cast with some fantastic scenery (filmed in Morocco) and great acting. I just don't understand why they don't make it available in HD. I see some pretty low budget, bad movies on Amazon Prime (Don't get me wrong, I love Amazon Prime!!) that have been made into Blu Ray; if they can do that to such bad movies I can not understand why Lyonsgate won't do it, unless there is an underlying  political motive; hard to believe though if they can turn this into millions of more money for them. Please release it soon, it is already available in Mexico and Germany.",1363737600,18,836,4.52317880794702
1345400,5,B00004RYFH,"This is the best movie of Jesus' life ever, true to scripture, so well done.  I have it on VHS and can't wait to have it on Blu-ray. It brings all the characters at the time of Jesus to life. I've loved it since it first aired on TV and nothing can compared to it ....",1362960000,14,268,3.7857142857142856
1345401,5,B00004RYFH,"Please make this movie available soon. Aside from the occasional television special during Easter...I've waited 36 years for this to come out on DVD/Blue Ray. The all star cast alone makes it all worth it, especially Olivia Hussey, a beautiful and talented actress. I trust that Amazon will make this happen.",1360368000,13,308,5.0588235294117645
1345402,5,B00004RYFH,"For years.. years, we waited for the DVD, now we wait for the Blu Ray..With Easter coming up this would be the perfect time to release this to us here in the US! I encourage you , strongly! If there is on must have for every believer it is this piece of art, period. HURRY!",1359417600,24,273,3.981818181818182

7921652,5,B00004RYFH,"I agree with previous reviewers.  What is the problem here?  We've had to wait YEARS to see this issued in Blu-ray, and now that it finally is, it isn't available in the U.S.!  Who's asleep at the wheel?  The U.S. population is listed on the internet as being between 73% and 78% Christian.  Why isn't this movie available HERE in Blu-ray?  Ludicrous!",1397433600,4,351,4.580645161290323
7921653,5,B00004RYFH,"YES, I AGREE WITH ALL HERE. IT IS WELL PAST TIME THAT THIS TITLE WAS PAID THE RESPECT IT IS DUE BY A PROPER FRAME BY FRAME RESTORATION INTO A HIGH QUALITY BLU RAY VERSION - WITH LOADS OF EXTRAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALTHOUGH OVERTLY OIRISH CATLIC IN NATURE; (MANY UNBIBLICAL SCENES, TOO MANY TO POINT OUT - AFTER ALL, THE MAN WYT' THE FUNNY HAT IN ROME DOESN'T GIVE HIS APPROVAL TO EVANGELICAL PRODUCTIONS, NOW DOES HE), THIS IS STILL A PRETTY SOLID DEPICTION OF THE LIFE OF JESUS, (THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF THE ONE TRUE LIVING GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC & JACOB; MESSIAH OF ISRAEL AND SAVIOUR OF WHOMSOEVER WILL BELIEVE).
THE ACTING IS PRETTY GOOD, (FOR A 70'S TV GIG); THE PHOTOGRAPHY IS QUITE DAZZLING IN PLACES; AND THE 6 PLUS HOURS IS ACTUALLY WARRANTED, GIVEN THE IMMENSE SCOPE OF THE NARRATIVE.
ALTHOUGH CAREFUL WHEN WATCHING HUMAN DEPICTIONS OF THE ANOINTED ONE; I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS ONE RANKS AS PERHAPS ONE OF THE VERY BEST SO FAR ACHIEVED; BOTH REVERENT AND VERY, VERY HUMAN IN ITS PORTRAYAL. AN ALL-STAR CAST THAT MOSTLY SHINE IS ALSO A HIGHLIGHT HERE.
THE REASON I REMAIN CAREFUL CONCERNING MOVIE PORTRAYALS IS BECAUSE THE BIBLE ACTUALLY COMMANDS US NOT TO MAKE PHYSICAL DEPICTIONS OF THE LORD; THE REASON SO MANY CATHOLIC DEPICTIONS ARE IN PRINT, (THE PASSION; THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST; KING OF KINGS; THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, ETC. ETC.); IS BECAUSE THE WRITERS OF THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM HAVE SEEN FIT TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE SECOND COMMANDMENT WHICH IS ALL ABOUT NOT MAKING GRAVEN IMAGES OF ANYTHING IN HEAVEN ETC.; AND SINCE JESUS IS NOW ACTUALLY IN HEAVEN STANDING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER IN INTERCESSION ON BEHALF OF BELIEVERS; THAT MEANS MAKING NO GRAVEN IMAGES OF HIM EITHER; WHETHER THEY ARE STATUES; STILLS, OR MOVING PICTURES; WE ARE WARNED AGAINST DOING SO.
SO HOW DOES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH COVER UP THIS REMOVAL OF THE 2ND COMMANDMENT AND STILL GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEIR FLOCK IS STILL FOLLOWING TEN INSTEAD OF NINE?
SIMPLE; KEEP THE 10 AS IS IN THEIR VERSION OF THE BIBLE AND CHOP UP THE LAST COMMANDMENT CONCERNING COVETING INTO TWO IN THE CATECHISM; NOW YOU HAVE `DO NOT COVET ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE' AND `DO NOT COVET ANOTHER MAN'S ASS, (DONKEY)'. WHERE THE BIBLE, (THE REAL BIBLE MAKES THESE TWO ACTUALLY ONE COMMANDMENT; THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM BREAKS THEM INTO TWO. AND SINCE WHEN ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN TAUGHT THE CATECHISM ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN SO INDOCTRINATED AS TO NOT ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE 10TH COMMANDMENT, (ONE OF THE FEW THINGS GOD HIMSELF ACTUALLY WROTE WITH HIS OWN FINGER), BEING MESSED AROUND WITH; IT WON'T MUCH MATTER IF THEY LEAVE IT AS IS IN THEIR PER-VERSION OF THE BIBLE. (NOW WE CAN ALL BOW DOWN TO STATUES OF WHOEVER HAS A HALO ON THIS CENTURY AND GET AWAY WITH SELLING ALL THOSE GLOW IN THE DARK EVER-VIRGIN MARY'S TO PROMOTE SUPERSTITIONS GALORE AND STILL GIVE THE MASSES, (EXCUSE THE PUN), THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE CHRIST OF THE BIBLE INSTEAD OF THE MANY CHRISTS OF THEIR IMAGINATION; YOU KNOW, THE STAIN GLASS BRAD PIT LONG HAIRED EX-HIPPY LOOKALIKE WHO IS SOFT ON SIN, RATHER THAN THE ONE DESCRIBED BY ISAIAH AS BEING OF NO COMELY APPEARANCE THAT WE SHOULD DESIRE HIM...)
ANY-WHO...
ALL THAT ASIDE; I STILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE AND DO BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE GIVEN THE PROPER BLU RAY TREATMENT BY LIONSGATE.
LONG OVERDUE.
HOPE IT HAPPENS SOON.
IT IS A 5 STAR FILM AND SHOULD BE GIVEN THE 5 STAR TREATMENT.
WOULD IT MAKE IT'S MONEY BACK?
IS THE JESUIT WITH THE FUNNY FISH-HAT CATLIC!
THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH OF HIS FOLLOWERS HANGING OUT TO SEE THIS MOVIE AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN.
THESE PEOPLE AT LIONSGATE WILL BE SNIGGERING ALL THE WAY TO THE ATM!
AND THAT...
IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT!!!
