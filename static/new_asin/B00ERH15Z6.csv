Special kudos to Barbara Bain who is remarkable in the part of a strong women who has some problems of her own, having to do with health and family. I would highly recommend this movie to any woman who is struggling -- or just fans of Miss Bain and Karen Black!",1399334400,,407,4.368421052631579
5934952,5,B00ERH15Z6,"This is a sincerely wonderful movie that touches on so many things. All performances, particularly by Barbara Bain, are superior and the simple yet not so simple story about a lonely young woman, her mentally ill mother, and the friendship developed with her boss is tender, funny and also includes some thoughtful drama. Recommended.",1390176000,2,334,5.203703703703703
5934953,5,B00ERH15Z6,"I read some reviews and totally agree, no car crashes and no bombs, just a great story line carried by great actors in this independent film.  I don't think anybody has broached the subject of Bi-Polar disorder or how frustrating it can be to deal with someone inflicted but this movie hit the nail in the head, great scenes and great acting.  I heard this was Karen Black's last feature role before her death and you could see how hard she worked on this.  What a great career and what a great exclamation point to put on her work.  Great writing and great acting.  Of course Barbara Bain was great too, this movie was worth the time to watch, i just wish i could wipe my memory clean and see it again.",1388188800,,703,4.295454545454546
