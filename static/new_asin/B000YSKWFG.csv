3035223,5,B000YSKWFG,"Little People Big World

This is an educational TV series which follows the Roloff family through their eveyday lives.  Both parents Matt and Amy are little people they have four children. A pair of twins,Jeremy is average size the other twin Zach is also little like his parents. Then comes Molly and the youngest is Jacob both are also average size. Sometimes you kind of forget that they are little and you just start seeing them as what they are normal human beings. This family through the magic of camaras let us into their home to show the world that little people are just like everyone else, the only difference is found in their physical struggles. I have learned a lot about little people through this amazing series.  The Roloffs also take their viewers to their conventions which opens our eyes to the need for more advocacy for this special community.  I highly recommend season 2 because it contains inspiring stories, a great vacation at Hawaii, and moving moments that will make you laugh and cry. The Roloffs are able to move mountains through their faith and resiliency.",1294617600,,1089,4.776595744680851
3035224,4,B000YSKWFG,"I love this show. Some people consider it voyeristic to watch this type of reality show,but is human nature to wonder how other people live in general. With this show, you will meet a family in which the mother and father and one of the children are little people. They have a condition called Dwarfism. Previously, little people were called midgets, which is an offensive term to them ( I learned that from this show). I also learned that people born with Dwarfism can not get health insurance because they have a preexisting health condition. The Roloffs pay for any doctors visits by going to their bank. That was an eye opener.
I thank the Roloffs for allowing people to see the day to day struggle that they overcome to live in a world that is not geared to their size. It is interesting to see that they struggle with the prejudices against their size. In one episode, a man pats the son on the head. The boy is 15 years old and it was inappropriate for a  stranger to walk by and pat this teenager on the head and laugh, just because he is a little person.

If you enjoy seeing how other families live, or want to know the struggles the Roloffs face or see how they persevere to live a very happy and loving life this show is for you. I love this family.
I give this only 4 out of 5 because I do not care that TLC is breaking the show into volumes. Just give us season 2 not season 2, vol. 1. They did this with LA Ink as well.",1231632000,2,1434,4.192028985507246
3035225,5,B000YSKWFG,"According to the packaging of Little People, Big World, Season 2 is in two parts, but I can only find Part 1.  Don't know if there is a part 2.

I can't say why I am drawn to this simple show, but maybe because we have the ability to examine our ""neighbor's"" home and life.  And the reality show is a departure from the numerous ones on TV that we can't truly connect with.  The average person didn't grow up or observe little people, hence the fascination.

And it is not just the Roloff's whose lives we are privy to, we get to observe some other little people's lives in their hometown.  In this season, you can enjoy the DAAA, an athletic program for little people to compete with their own skill level.  We learn the story of ""little Zack"" , a fast moving little guy whose big heart is revealed when his Dad leaves for Iraq.  There is also footage of another Little People's Convention.  You will also envy the Roloff's as they venture into Hawaii and Matt (being Matt) is inspired to recreate a ride that zips a person across a cable.

Another interesting fun segment is the visit from both families of Amy's and Matt's for Thanksgiving.  In the episode, with a few days before all the families converge on the farm, Matt, (being Matt) decides to have the old wood floor torn up.  And, per usual, the farm toys are spotlighted when another mule (farm vehicle)is purchased. You will be amused at the trebuchet, the pumpkin skyrocketing gadget.

Regardless how much money is spent, (remember folks, they earn money from a TV show), the fun is in the watching.

The episodes:
Twins At Sixteen, Organizing Amy, The Greenhouse Effect, Get Out Of Town, Roloffs In Paradise, Aloha, Roloffs, Road To The DAAA, Game On! and Little Fort, Big Deck.

All Decked Out, While Amy's Away, Zip To My Lu, A Roloff Thanksgiving Part 1 & 2, A Whole Lotta Little and A Big Little Conference.

A Twin Experience, Little Farm, Big Apple, Mad About Mules, Twin Trouble, Matt On A Mission, Farm Overload Trebuchet Trouble.

8234011,1,B000YSKWFG,"Watched season 1 and most of season 2 long ago and wanted to now come back and binge watch the rest of the available series only to find it's not available.  Watching tv shows and movies long after they've aired or gone off tv is one of the main reasons people prefer things like Amazon Video.  Lately, it seems only the latest episodes and movies are available while older ones are gone.  Don't know if this is an issue with the television/ movie studios or television providers but if not corrected, people, myself included will find their entertainment elsewhere.  Used to love the variety of content Amazon Video and Amazon Prime provided because they had newer and older content as well as the more obscure hard to find movies and tv shows. Doesn't seem to be the case anymore.  Would like to see responses in the comment section as well (as that's where most people look for actions being taken) to at least know an issue is being looked at or a solution worked on so those reading comments can be informed without having to do one on one emails which only inform the sender.",1483228800,,1081,4.523076923076923
8234012,1,B000YSKWFG,"It does not matter if you are big or small, disabled or not no one needs to treat a wife the way matt does. No matter what she wants to do or how she  wants to do it he is such a A$$. Run girl run far run fast. Don't stay anywhere near him. You can go buy a farm of your own and know what it is like to be happy without his negativity. No one needs someone like him in their lives. People like him are not happy unless they are hurting other people's feelings in some way. He needs to get over himself and realize other people have a right to be happy and he doesn't have the right to nay say about everything.",1482192000,,610,3.8031496062992125
