5185545,2,B008VPCL6M,"I ordered this item because of the Tex Avery MGM cartoons included in it. Wow! ""Red Hot Riding Hood,"" ""Swingshift Cinderella"" et al on Blu-ray! Sharp, brilliant high definition! Imagine my disappointment when the product arrived, I loaded up the disc containing said MGM Avery treasures, and it looked like I was watching them on VHS. Thanks for making it clear, Product Information, that these Avery cartoons are in ""standard definition"" (though they look even worse, with those intermittent comb-like parallel black lines that appear occasionally in the image in certain digital videos). My excitement face-planted to disappointment just like that.

Caveat emptor... suckers!",1350518400,72,677,5.509615384615385
5185546,2,B008VPCL6M,"Warner Home Video insists on packing these blurays like sausages... Full of recycled supplement filler from previous DVD sets. But with this one, they hit a new low. A large chunk of the cartoons on this set (everything labelled as ""bonus material"") isn't in 1080p. It's standard def. All those great MGM Tex Avery cartoons? Yep. They just shoved a DVD on a bluray disk and tried to slip it by you.

Here is a clue for Warner Home Video... Why would a cartoon fan buy this set? Odds are, he already has all the DVD sets... He's buying it for HI DEF CARTOONS. We don't need hour upon hour of repurposed mumbling commentary and rah rah cheerleader animation historians telling us how GREAT! everything is. We want HI DEF CARTOONS. We ESPECIALLY don't want cartoons in DVD quality as some sort of booby prize ""bonus"".

If Warner gave us what we want, and lots of it, they would get five stars. But the filler on this set that they charged me for and I don't want cuts that in half- 2 1/2 stars, rounded down for the stupidity of whoever decided that bluray customers want blurays filled with DVDs.",1350345600,22,1094,4.465
5185547,3,B008VPCL6M,"Not only this will be the first time the post-1935 black and white Looney Tunes will be on Blu Ray but also 10 shorts will be new-to-DVD all remastard on this release:

with its original opening titles restored - **
with its original opening ringss restored - ***

*What Makes Daffy Duck? (1948, Art Davis) Hilarious
*Birdy and the Beast (1944, Bob Clampett)
*Home, Tweet Home (1950, Friz Freleng)** Funny
*The High and the Flighty (1955, Robert McKimson)
*Porky's Hare Hunt (1938, Ben Hardaway) My favorite
*Hare-um Scare-um (1939, Ben Hardaway and Cal Dalton) This version will have its original ending remastard back to the cartoon.
*Prest-O Change-O (1939, Chuck Jones) My personal favorite
*The Lion's Busy (1950, Friz Freleng)** Hilarious
*Strife with Father (1950, Robert McKimson)** Funny
*A Horsefly Fleas (1947, Robert McKimson)

Note: the previous released cartoon ""Canned Feud"" is remastard with its original opening ringss unlike LTGC Vol. 1 which had the Blue Ribbon reissue version.

And 11 Tex Avery directed MGM shorts will also be on this release, but only on Blu Ray and they're not remastard unfortunately:
*Blitz Wolf (1942)
*Red Hot Riding Hood (1943)
*Screwball Squirrel (1944)
*Swing Shift Cinderella (1945)

*Bad Luck Blackie (1949)

*Wags to Riches (1949)
*Symphony in Slang (1951) Hilarious
*Magical Maestro (1952) Hilarious
*Rock-a-Bye Bear (1952) My favorite

I only recommend this for those new-to-DVD and Blu Ray cartoona. And it's only for those who want to have the previous release shorts from the Golden Collections and Super Stars on Blu Ray in HD instead.",1345593600,52,1641,5.224334600760456
5185548,1,B008VPCL6M,"Let's review what Warner has released in the past deacade:

*Golden Collection-6 volumes (first DVD edition; contained new cartoons, but not in their original order)
*Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection-7 volumes (contained some of the cartoons that appeared in the Golden Collection)
*Looney Tunes Super Stars series -6 collections (3 of them contained unrelaesed before film cartoons)
*Essential series- Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck (mostly released before cartoons, with one new cartoon for each collection)
*Platinum Collection-2 volumes so far (first blu-ray edition,mostly relaesed before cartoons)
*Showcase (contained some of the cartoons in the Platinum)
plus there are probably at least half a dozen Bugs Bunny collections with previously released before films.

Summary: to date, No Collection conatines the full Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies filmography (even though the Golden Collection was supposed to be a 'collectors' collection'. I Guess I understand that term different then what it means to WB). That goes even for the Laserdic and VHS collections of the 90's.

Since the end of the Golden Collection, only the Super Stars collections contained new material and it was announced even this series will end (but recently, it was apprently going to continue). The only really new collection to appear in 2012 is the ""Chuck Johnes mouse collection"", a very small silver lining on a hugh cloud.

I am no DVD market expert, nor am I an expert in the restoration process. But the way I see it, for each new 'collectior's edtion' you end up paying more and getting less. So I suggest to WB (in a vain hope they will listen):
A *real* Golden Collection-everything from 1930 to 1969, and for all i care, charge us a 100$ per volume (the way youv'e been going, it will actualy be cheaper than buying the incomplete collections).
Alongside, you could release smaller and cheaper charachters collections-the best of Bugs, Daffy, Sylvester, Tweety, Foghorn, Roadrunner, etc. though even these collections would better be released with new to DVD cartoons and in their original order.
How about it, WB? will you *finally* do the decent thing with your cartoon legacy?

*post thoughts: After a certain commentator repeatedly attacked me (with some poor insults,some of which were deleted and on whom I do not care to waste any more comments) I thought I ought to make something clear.
Using the Amazon review system for an item I do not intened to buy (for the reasons given above) is in my opinion justified, just like reviewing items ahead of a release date.
I do not belive you have to buy or own an item to write reviews (or comment on other reviews), except in cases of discussing subjects as shippment or technical quality which do require more then basic knowledge.
It is anybody's right not to agree with me (or even call this a lost cause) and comment, but in a respectable way - which unlike buying items, I do consider mandatory in this system and elsewhere on the web.
Finally, I only wrote this review (and some like it before) beacuse of dissapointment (shared I belive by many, but I take sole responsibility) with the Warner marketing system, which repackges (or 'double dippes') in a blu-ray edition a collection mostly released alreday On DVD, while making unavailable a full collection, or at least one that will continue where the Golden Collection (which I did buy and own) stopped.
I am not against repackeging in principle (and anybody can decide for themselvs wheter to buy them or not) but I am against ingnoring those who want to see a complete Looney Tunes collection in this generation, which Warner should be proud of making so that everyone could enjoy a classic cartoon series.",1345248000,55,3706,5.0
5185549,5,B008VPCL6M,"Even though I own all six Looney Tunes Golden Collections, I bought the first Platinum Collection, and I plan to buy this second Platinum Collection. The fact that most of the cartoons on this new release already appeared on the Golden Collections does not bother me. I like to be able to see the cartoons in different orders. Also, these double dips are the best of these cartoons. I also like the fact that there is more variety on these discs, as opposed to having an entire disc devoted to just one character. I like the fact that these have a lower price, so hopefully, more people will buy them, and it will continue well beyond six volumes. It is precisely because of the double dips that the price of this is so much lower than the Golden Collections. Remastering cartoons is expensive. Because most of the cartoons on this release were already released on past releases, the cost of including them on this release is approximately zero. Think of it this way: we are basically paying for the 10 or so cartoons that are new to this release, and everything else here is like a bonus. Please keep the Platinum Collections coming.",1344902400,24,1134,4.5911330049261085
5185550,3,B008VPCL6M,"When it has came down to Warner Brothers and the Looney Tunes cartoons, for over 70 years they have definitely been some of the most innovative and influential cartoons in the world. From hilarious highs and lows, they have definitely to what has been so revered in animation beyond whatever words could be expressed. But over the past few years, Warner Brothers has kind of lost their way in making great DVDs and videos that have reflected their best in animation. The past several years, many of their collections on video are ones that have featured cartoons that already have been on video, with little change of pace. They did deliver well with their Pepe Le Pew DVD earlier this year from the Looney Tunes Super Stars collection, but other than that, not much has changed. Now that Looney Tunes has decided to go ahead with their Platinum Collection, many were skeptical if it was going to deliver. Mostly it did, but not in regards to doing enough. Now their sequel is set to be released, but is it worth the money? Well, not really.

The Looney tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2, picks up where the first one left off. Many cartoons have been on video before, without anything that has appealed to die hard Looney Tunes fanatics. The collection is a 2 Disc compilation of cartoons before from the Looney Tunes Golden Collections Volumes 1-6, without anything new. The first disc includes cartoons that have been on video before, with few new to DVD or Blu-Ray, Disc 1: A Wild Hare, Buckaroo Bugs, Long-Haired Hare, Ali Baba Bunny, Show Biz Bugs, The Wise Quacking Duck, Book Review, the brilliant Chuck Jones Sherlock Holmes parody Deduce You Say, Porky In Wackyland, You Ought To Be In Pictures, Porky In Egypt, Back Alley Oproar (which makes its debut on Blu-Ray and DVD for the first time), Little Red Rodent Hood, Canned Feud, Gift Wrapped, Birdy & The Beast, Home Tweet Home, Going! Going! Gosh!, Zipping Along, Scent-Imental Romeo, The Foghorn Leghorn, The High & The Flighty (also new to Blu-Ray & DVD), Tobasco Road and Mexicali Schmoes.

Disc 2 also contains one that have been on DVD before, but little change from the Golden Collections before. The collection of cartoons also highlight their most influential in animation, but still more could've been chosen. Here is the lineup for Disc 2: Wabbit Twouble, Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning, Duck! Rabbit! Duck!, Drip-Along Daffy, My Little Duckaroo, Barbary-Coast Bunny, Tortoise Beats Hare, Tortoise Wins By A Hare, Rabbit Transit, Porky's Hare Hunt (new to Blu-Ray & DVD), Hare-Um Scare-Um, Prest-O Change-O, Elmer's Candid Camera, Bugs Bunny Gets The Boid, The Bashful Buzzard, The Lion's Busy, Strife With Father, An Itch In Time, A Horsefly Fleas, Hollywood Steps Out, Page Miss Glory, Rocket-Bye Baby, Russian Rhapsody, Dough, Ray, Me-Ow.  Overall, the collection does include some good ones remastered, but others that should've been recognized. They could've just brought more to make it worth while.

Overall, The Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2 is not a buy for anyone whom is new to watching these delightful cartoons in animation. While it doesn't stand out as much as the first Platinum Collection was a stronger lineup for beginners to the Looney Tunes, there are some interesting choices here. I still honestly recommend The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volumes 1-6 which might cost a little more, but it is worth every penny. I wish more hilarious cartoons could've been chosen here than what has already been on video before. Hopefully, if there is a third volume on the horizon, Warner Brothers can definitely have a better job of getting it right.

Disc 3 TEX AVERY MGM CARTOONS COME TO BLU-RAY (although in STANDARD DEFINITION)!!!! But sorry DVD fans, they will not be in the DVD version.

Since Hi-Defenition transfers were created when restoring the Looney Tunes cartoons for the Golden Collection DVDs it is easy for WBHV to re-issue these on Blu-ray.  This doesn't mean that no further restoration work was done, it only means that most are the same film transfers.  It will not be like comparing the old Laserdisc & VHS tapes to the Golden collection DVDs. However they will have better resolution than the DVDs so an improvement will be seen.
The ""New to DVD"" titles will show the most improvement.

It was such great fun to go from Bugs to Tweety to Speedy Gonzalez to Foghorn Leghorn, and so on all morning long.  What were they thinking?  If you want any shot at variety with these Blu-rays, you have to play one short at a time, returning to the menu to pick a new short every 7 minutes.  Are you kidding me?

Then, there's the overall selections.  I can't really complain too much.  They did a decent job of gathering mostly essentials, but they were so close to nailing JUST the essentials that they should have gone ahead and done it.  In the first (and only, it seems) three Blu-ray Platinum collections, they really should have just gone ahead and gathered the best 150 - at least a collection that COULD have passed as someone's reasonable Best 150 - Looney Tunes shorts.  They did get what most reasonable fans would consider about the best 75-90 worked into it, so I'm thankful.  But dang, they were so close to having something so great.

Oh, well.  Five stars anyway.  Because Looney Tunes rule.",1490832000,6,1566,4.645985401459854

5185584,4,B008VPCL6M,"I picked this up on Amazon for just under $20. If I didn't already own the previous Looney Tunes Golden Collections, I'd say it's a great bargain for that price and a worthwhile purchase. However, I see no noticeable improvement in picture quality in going from DVD to Blu-ray, at least not for the vast majority of cartoons.

The real reason for buying the Blu-ray over the DVD is the added 3rd disc with lots of bonus (again, mostly previously released stuff) and the extra Tex Avery cartoons. Looney Tunes fans have long wanted a proper release of Tex Avery cartoons, but here it's a mixed blessing because these were not remastered and do not look as good as the other cartoons. Also, if you've already got the previous collections, there are only about 10 ""new to DVD"" cartoons here.

The Golden Collections had 60 cartoons per set and lots of bonus features. These Platinum sets have only 50 cartoons each but are priced lower. However, most of the cartoons were already released and few are new to collectors which makes it hard to justify the cost. A new, third Platinum Collection is due out soon... from what I've read on-line so far, it doesn't seem worth buying as it has hardly any new to DVD cartoons. Again, if you don't already own the Golden Collections, these platinum Blu-ray collections are good when you find them on sale, otherwise wait for the sale.

5185587,5,B008VPCL6M,"In 2012, the DVD AND Blu-ray versions of volume 2 of the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection came out at the same time, in time for Christmas! This volume contains 10 shorts never before on DVD, authorized at least, in the case of The Lion's Busy and Prest-O Change-O being in the Public Domain, only here the former has its original opening and ending credits reinstated! It's a shame the DVDs never came with 3rd discs full of bonuses, since the Blu-ray version contains 11 shorts from MGM directed by Tex Avery himself. Even with such solid-gold goodies in it, volume 2 never sold too well on either format, causing the WB to run out of moo-lah to restore any more Looney Tunes shorts that haven't been on DVD before, after volume 3 and the Hippety Hopper Super Stars DVD. All 3 volumes in the Platinum Collection contain 50 shorts apiece, all restored and remastered in HD, each with a handful of shorts never before on DVD. Heaven knows why volume 2 didn't sell too good; it contains Bugs Bunny's prototype period, including the completely uncut version of Hare-um Scare-um, right down to its original extended ending cut out for theatres (the staff thought that ending was too similar to that of Daffy Duck and Egghead, so that's why it never surfaced until here in 2012)! Like I keep saying with classic Disneytoon DVDs, just be thankful for what you have (it WAS close to Thanksgiving when I typed this)! Sadly, with volume 3, ""That's All, Folks!"", unless the WB and Jerry Beck reconsider what they said about running out of dough for more Looney Tunes shorts never before on DVD. Luckily, it had no effect on other classic toons being remastered, like Tom and Jerry's Gene Deitch era, the Peanuts gang's non-holiday Emmy-nominated/-winning specials, and the whole series of Atom Ant AND Secret Squirrel for their 50th anniversaries!",1447632000,4,1838,4.783018867924528

5185606,4,B008VPCL6M,"After seeing the pros and cons of this set, and after buying a $70 Blu-Ray/DVD player, I decided to buy this set, not only for the Tex Avery cartoons, but for some of the other cartoons that I didn't already have. While the cartoons on Discs 1 and 2 are perfectly clean, don't expect any shorts on Disc 3 to be remastered. The Captain and The Kids cartoons look somewhat restored, but some of the Tex Avery shorts look like they were either Turner broadcasting prints or simply remastered from the master elements (THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REMASTERED AND RESTORED. Remastered is when a new copy of the cartoon is made, whereas restored is where the image and sound are painstakingly cleaned up.) Not only that, but the Mr. Hook cartoons, as well as Friz On Film look like they were taken off VHS (If they were the only versions available, I understand.) Nevertheless, I will say that even if it is expensive, having the Tex Avery cartoons on Blu-Ray (although in SD and not in HD) as special features is (to an extent) better than not having them at all, unless you want to settle for the MGM/UA VHS and LaserDisc releases.

As for the Looney Tunes cartoons on the first 2 discs, you know how good they are.
Disc 1 has most of the stars we know and love: Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety and Sylvester, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Some of the iconic cartoons include: A Wild Hare, Buckaroo Bugs, Book Revue, Porky In Wackyland, You Ought To Be In Pictures, as well as Academy Award Winners Tabasco Road and Mexicali Shmoes.
Disc 2 includes the entire Bugs and Daffy Hunting Trilogy in chronological order, as well as the complete Nasty Canasta, Bugs and Cecil, Beaky Buzzard, and A. Flea, as well as the early Bugs Bunny prototypes and select one-shots that represent certain eras of the studio's history: Hollywood Steps Out (reflecting the many Hollywood film and celebrity parodies), Page Miss Glory (representing the many music-driven Merrie Melodies, and a stand-out for its Great Gatsby-esque art deco), Rocket-Bye Baby (one of many Chuck Jones greats, this one set in the space age), and Russian Rhapsody (an amazing example of the many Warner wartime shorts).
Disc 3 (ONLY on Blu-Ray) is nothing but special features and bonus cartoons that will most likely appeal to cartoon buffs. In addition to documentaries surrounding Tex Avery, Friz Freleng, and Private Snafu, there is also ToonHeads: The Lost Cartoons (with rare cartoons, commercials, and feature film animated sequences), some early black-and white Looney Tunes, hilarious behind-the-scenes footage of the Warner Bros. studio staff ""at work"", as well as Private Snafu cartoons (made exclusively for the Army), Mr. Hook cartoons (made exclusively for the Navy), 5 Captain and The Kids cartoons (Friz Freleng's MGM cartoons from the late 30's), and last but not least, although in SD, a selection of TEX AVERY'S MGM CARTOONS, INCLUDING BLITZ WOLF, RED HOT RIDING HOOD (regarded by many, including myself, as the best cartoon ever made), SCREWBALL SQUIRREL, AND KING-SIZE CANARY!!!!!

Again, the 4 star rating was due to poor copies of Private Snafu and Mr. Hook, but like the headline says, this has a little bit of everything for the animation aficionado.",1428796800,2,3226,4.8743169398907105

5185620,5,B008VPCL6M,"Before a review or critique of these cartoons can be made, the viewer of this material MUST grasp 2 facts about the material:
1) The content was NEVER intended for Children to be the main audience. A lot of (mis-directed) criticism has been thrown towards Warner Bros. for the violence and racial comedy in these cartoons. Although the cartoons are (mostly) appropriate for all ages, the original intended audience was the adult American movie goer. These cartoons were created to be shown at the movie theater, on the big screen, before the main show. it was in the 1940's, 50's & 60's considered to be part of an 'evenings entertainment"" at the cinema.
2) To ""whitewash"" or to pretend that some of the material is obviously racially insensitive and abusive is to ""whitewash"" and ignore the reality of American culture of the time period when these films were created. America at that time was a racist and segregateonal society. This is an undisputable fact and any attempt to downplay or ignore this is an affront to the victims of the abuse.
Racism is wrong, has always been wrong,
But to act as if it has never existed in our culture is even more wrong, it's insulting.

With that out of the way, this wonderful collection of cartoons has to be among the greatest film treasures for ANY fan of comedy. If you are from my age group (mid-30's) then you will no doubt recall some of these cartoons from your Saturday mornings.
When I was young, these cartoons was hilarious. As an adult, the same cartoons are even more funny, and for all different reasons. The ""gang from termite terrace"" were some very funny and clever fellows, and it shows all through this collection.
The blue-ray HD quality of the films is AMAZING. Especially when you compare it side by side to the old TV Show quality. Breathtaking.

And did I mention that these cartoons are SOOOO FUNNY!!!! I am looking forward to sharing these treasures with my newborn son when the time is right, and hopefully, my grandchildren in the future.

5185658,3,B008VPCL6M,"Okay, for starters I think it's swell that these cartoons are being re-released in an optimal quality format, even for those who have already invested large sums of time and money in earlier compilations. And the bonus documentary material is probably fascinating viewing as often as twice. But has anyone else grown a tad weary of being treated only to the cartoons that Leonard Maltin or Jerry Beck thinks you should see? Or at least in their order of relevance?

I get that life is short and it's plain greedy--not to mention expensive--to want everything. But is there any reason why we can't order a la carte? We can download individual songs; why not cartoons?

If Mssrs Maltin and Beck were genuine boosters of the genre and not (however subtly) themselves, they could give us the choice by creating a database of every available title in the library--which hopefully would be all of them--with a brief synopsis and perhaps a 15-second preview clip. That way, viewers could not only amass their own favorites (I still say that the best Warner Bros. cartoons, or any other kind, are the ones you enjoy the most, not the ones Leonard and Jerry pick out for you) and fill out their previous collections, but ""discover"" relatively unfamiliar titles and wonder ""Wow, where have you guys been all my life?"" Perhaps, for an added fee, the customer's choices could even be made into a professional quality Blu-Ray DVD; don't tell me that's not possible in this day and age! Give the customer more choice at a reasonable price--even at Amazon's discounts, it's not much of a bargain when half the cartoons in the collection don't grab you--and everybody wins. Why not?

In the meantime, it's nice that this second Platinum volume majors in 1940s cartoons, despite the highly arguable consensus among animation historians that the '50s Warner Bros. cartoons are the best.",1356998400,7,1868,4.886435331230284

as for the disc contents, much like the 1st volume a good amount of the shorts have been already released in the golden collection DVD's however i would like to merely point out that this is the 1st time these shorts have found their way on to Blu-ray. and yes the video quality might be grainy but as i said in my review for vol 1 that considering how old these cartoons are and the different conditions i've seen them in i give WB a standing ovation for doing as excellent of a job as they did restoring them. i will complain along with everyone though about the shorts on the 3rd disc being 480p SD, why can't those be 1080p HD too? all in all though it's still well worth buying",1353974400,4,1064,4.428571428571429

These are great cartoons that I would like to see released. Now if Universal would only release the Andy Panda and Chilly Willy cartoons in a set along with there other cartoons it would be great. The same goes for MGM. All they  ever released was Tom and Jerry and the Droopy cartoons.

5185668,5,B008VPCL6M,"I remember when Looney Tunes was being announced for Blu-ray.  I waited, and agonized for it for several months, until it came out, and while it wasn't my intention at the time to buy the Collectors Edition, the store in which I bought it from was doing a special $20 off promotion for the collectors edition, making it the same price as the regular edition, and I couldn't resist myself, and bought it.  I was pleasantly surprised by detail put in to the release.  The box, while not very sturdy, and significantly larger than most blu-rays, felt like it was intended for collectors, with that little push that just made it feel special.  So it came to no surprise that I was very disappointed that the second collection would just be in one edition, and not only is it in one edition, gone is the nice hard case, and the nice detail on it.  While aesthetically it is very similar to the first collection, instead of being in a nice hard book, it's instead in a regular old blu-ray case, with a regular old O-card (aka sleeve).  This is probably the biggest concern I have with the release, which is more than made up for in the fact that the Bonus features are much better than that in the first collection, and the cartoon selection is some of the best, including some of my personal favorites, the celebrity cameo cartoons.  I am really hoping that future collections contain more of the historical cartoons, because to me they are some of the most interesting cartoons produced by the Looney Tunes.",1352851200,5,1503,4.565055762081784
5185669,1,B008VPCL6M,"Okay, WB. I've tried to be patient with you, but now you've crossed the line.

Here I am, a huge fan of ""Looney Tunes"" that's trying to get all of the cartoons on DVD. And here you are, WB, who is making it rather difficult for me to achieve that goal. First, you cancel the Golden Collection DVDs. That's okay. I knew you weren't going to stop putting ""Looney Tunes"" on DVD that easily. So, you release the Super Stars DVDs. Okay, they're kind of a downgrade from the Golden Collections, as they are only single disc and have no special features, but I can live with that. Then, you release the Platinum Collections to both Blu-Ray and DVD, and this was the straw that broke the camal's back.

First of all, I don't get the whole Blu-ray craze. There's nothing wrong with DVDs, so why are you trying to get me to use more money to buy movies when I can get them on DVD for a cheaper price? Why?

Second, ""Looney Tunes"" weren't filmed in HD, so you're kind of alternating history when you remaster them in HD.

Third of all, why all the freaking double dip!? I could understand if you repeat one or two cartoons, but only having eight cartoons that are new to DVD out of a fifty cartoon collection?! Sorry, WB, but that's just pathetic.

Fourth of all, Tex Avery is my favorite cartoon director of all time. I've  been waiting YEARS for a proper release of all of his cartoons on DVD... So, what do you do, WB? You add SOME of his MGM cartoons as bonus features, exclusive to the Blu-Ray, and don't even remaster them in HD... Why!? What was the point of making them exclusive to the all mighty Blu-Ray, if you weren't going to make the cartoons HD?! What the heck is wrong with you screwballs?! Beaky Buzzard could put together a better collection cartoons than you hacks.

So, WB, I have some suggestions for you.

1. Cut out the freaking double dip and only release new-to-DVD cartoons.
2. Make the DVD versions of these collections exactly like the Blu-Ray versions.
3. Make a legit collection of all of Tex Avery's MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons.

5185671,3,B008VPCL6M,"Blu-ray Disc(tm) packaging alert!

First off, let me say that I love the Looney Tunes franchise and Warner Bros. did another outstanding job with the content transfer to BD.

However, once again, WB has decided to change the packaging format of a ""disc series"" in between releases. For those of you who have not yet purchased this set, just be advised that the discs are now packaged in a standard multi-pack Blu-ray Disc(tm) package, and not the metallic-looking hard-cover book used for Volume One.

Now I have no objection to the new format, in fact, I prefer it. But whoever is handling the preparation and packaging of Warner Bros.' box sets, should be fired! I don't think I've ever purchased a single WB TV series or disc set on DVD or Blu-ray that has managed to stick to one format throughout the life of its release. Whether it be ""The Walton's"" [Packaging: Digi-pak > Slim box > Multi-pak DVD // Disc Format: Double-side > Single-Sided > 7 discs > 6 discs > 5 discs > 4 discs, etc.] or a series like ""Knots Landing"", where the releases were cancelled after a mere two seasons (and both volumes were packaged differently, BTW).

That said, Warner Bros. should take a note from Paramount on how to release consistent AND timely box sets.",1350604800,9,1246,4.65
5185672,2,B008VPCL6M,"Who's in charge of these ? Is it you, Jerry Beck, as we were lead to believe? And if so, how about fulfilling your promises and opening the vault? And treating them in a manner that befits their classic status?
I love ""Looney Tunes"" and I love my Blu-ray and I DON'T MIND paying again for these classics to be remastered so I can see them in 1080p. It's awesome! But to take one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) cartoons of all time, ""Red Hot Riding Hood"" and slap out on the bonus disc in a standard VHS copy is insulting to me and all the other fans out there. Actually NONE of the content on disc three is in HD so it's NOT a Blu-ray! It's a DVD!
Look, I understand the realities of marketing and customer demand; You can't put all Bugs or Daffy on one set because no one (or very few) would buy Porky or Sylvester. You can't put them in chronological order because the average consumer wouldn't buy the black and whites. I don't expect you to remaster all the documentaries or featurettes BUT the cartoons themselves? There's no excuse except a money grab.
The packaging that Volume two comes in doesn't even match the first one! It's completely different.
I honestly don't understand the WB's complete indifference to the Looney Tunes collections and the Looney Tunes collector. It's a rabid fan base. And as proven time and again there is quite a market for deluxe sets. Why not issue deluxe collector's versions? the Complete Tex Avery!! The Complete Chuck Jones!! The Complete One Shots and Minis! Hell, Just do The Warner Bros and the complete MGM! To big? break 'em down! Complete Looney Tunes 1930-1942, Complete Merrie Melodies 1931-1942.....
All cartoons ReMastered??In 1080p? You'd make a fortune and the fans would be happy.
