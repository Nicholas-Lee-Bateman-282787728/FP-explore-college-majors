1996360,5,B0001FVDXC,"If you grew up in the 1950s as I did you will know that a movie such as WAR ARROW was made strickly for entertainment and garnering money for the studio. Don't look for a message, and that trite phrase ""political correctness"" did not exist back then.

This is a low budget movie with several stars of box office draw showing the ""west"" as Hollywood saw it. Yes, it is western history according to Hollywood and that 'west' was never the actual west. Don't attempt to make more of this DVD or less than it was and is: it was and is pure entertainment and that is it. If you don't like B-westerns then watch something else, however, if like me you grew up with these movies and enjoy revisiting old films you saw as a kid, then watch on. Many reviewers were not alive in the 1950s and have no idea whatever concerning the times or the movies that played at the local Bijou, and trust me, in the 1950s era westerns ruled. And WAR ARROW is no better, no worse, than most. And it was shot in good color, which many were not.

1996361,3,B0001FVDXC,"This is a good movie for those out there putting a Maureen O'Hara movie collection together. The story moves along well and you might even recognize some other upcoming stars in supporting actor roles. The bottom line ? Maureen O'Hara looks great and has that ""spark"" that set her well ahead of the pack.",1174262400,8,304,4.648148148148148
1996362,3,B0001FVDXC,"""War Arrow"" opens with major Jeff Chandler arriving at Fort Clark, Texas, and discovering that Colonel John McIntire openly opposes the government endorsed plan to make use of displaced Seminole Indians to stop the bloody Kiowa uprising on soldiers and settlers...

In fact, the only person at the fort who is friendly to Chandler is Maureen O'Hara, the attractive widow of Captain James Bannon...

All the action leads to a tidy end: Chandler discovers Bannon is very much alive (at least at the climax of the movie) and is really the renegade white chief of the Kiowas...

In the small assigned action-packed moments in this slight entrance, the pillaging Kiowas are totally controlled... For a rare change Maureen had some harsh competition in the fascinating department, which was supplied by Suzan Ball as the passionately sensual daughter of the Seminole chief...

The film is more of an excuse to show that excellent guys, always end up with excellent girls--even when the best guy resists authority and tries to match one tribe of Indians against another... All right! But not very imaginative... don't you think?",1162944000,,1121,5.076086956521739
1996363,4,B0001FVDXC,"War Arrow is one of those Westerns that has fallen through the cracks over time. One reason is that there were so many of them. Another reason is that its male star, Jeff Chandler, was still in the early stages of superstardom before his untimely death in 1962. Another reason may be that War Arrow would never be considered one of the all-time great Westerns.

But War Arrow is also a very fun, entertaining Western with a great cast and top-notch execution. Chandler plays a cavalry officer sent to an outpost surrounded by besieging Kiowa Indians. Joined by fellow soldiers Charles Drake and Noah Beery, Chandler immediately annoys the fort's superior officer (played by John McIntire with his usual solid but natural acting style). Chandler accomplishes this by suggested that neighboring Seminole Indians would make a perfect weapon against the warring Kiowas.

Chandler also immediately becomes smitten with O'Hara, a widow of a recently killed cavalry soldier. O'Hara veers wildly from being madly in love with Chandler to being confused about being a widow in love so soon after her husband's death.

Chandler begins to train the Seminoles to fight, all the while realizing that McIntire is a rival for O'Hara's affections. Meanwhile, the Kiowas are working toward an attack on the fort.

The plot moves along crisply, with a number of nicely staged action pieces. Everyone does their job well and War Arrow is more than worth a Western-lover's time.",1141171200,63,1458,5.037344398340249
1996364,4,B0001FVDXC,"Okay, this vehicle for Maureen O'Hara and Jeff Chandler isn't top drawer; still, it's nicely entertaining and filled with rip-snorting action. Universal-International put a lot of good production values into their '50s Westerns, and their output with Jimmy Stewart, Audie Murphy, Rock Hudson, and even Rory Calhoun, is admirable. War Arrow has those good values, and some decent acting, as well. Not maybe in the league with NO NAME ON THE BULLET or CANYON PASSAGE or some of the other Universals of the period, but still worth the relatively inexpensive price charged.",1086652800,23,569,5.195652173913044
1996365,2,B0001FVDXC,"While ""B"" westerns died out in the early 50s, with the rising popularity of television, Hollywood continued to make dozens of ""A"" westerns with name stars and more adult situations. Some were true classics like ""Shane"" and ""The Searchers""--some were just ""product""--something to fill half of a double bill. ""War Arrow"" falls into the latter category.
Jeff Chandler stars as a US cavalry officer who tries to use a ""good"" Indian tribe--the Seminoles--against a ""bad"" tribe of marauding Kiowas. Let's not get into ""political correctness""--the film is over 50 years old. Not only does he have his hands full with these Native Americans, the commanding officer of the local fort, played by a gruff John McIntyre, resents his presence and ""progressive"" ideas. A beautiful ""widow""--Maureen O'Hara--is trapped at the fort, and she soon has Jeff practically drooling over her. Since John wants her too, the ""rapport"" between the two men plunges further downhill. The movie toddles along for about an hour, before a climactic attack on the fort by those nasty Kiowas--led by Jay Silverheels, taking a break from his ""good guy"" Tonto image !
Jeff Chandler, with his piercing eyes and prematurely grey hair, gives the film more dignity than it deserves. He was a good actor, and his early death deprived the movies of a fine leading man. Maureen O'Hara has always been a stunning woman--that red hair, those flashing eyes, the fiery ""Irish colleen"" personality--yet, in this film, she seems to be going through the motions. Perhaps after ""The Quiet Man"", movies like this were not exactly inspiring for her. Comic relief is provided by Noah Beery as one of Mr. Chandler's sidekicks--Charles Drake is the other. Suzan Ball sizzles as an ""Indian maid"", while Henry Brandon is solid as her father, the Seminole chief--not the first or last time that Mr. Brandon would play a Native American. Another member of the tribe, with totally understandable ""hots"" for Ms. Ball, is played by Dennis Weaver--not too well--a good thing that ""Gunsmoke"" was just around the corner ! ""B"" western actor, Jim Bannon, is also featured--he may bill himself as ""James"" here, but his acting is as wooden and one-dimensional as ever.
The DVD exhibits a colourful, if slightly hazy, full-screen picture, and mono sound.
I bought ""War Arrow"" because I like westerns, Jeff Chandler and Maureen O'Hara--but sometimes, even with a lot of good ingredients, you can wind up with a second-rate stew ! I would file this one under ""disappointing"".",1086566400,38,2502,5.045893719806763

1996369,3,B0001FVDXC,"The setting of 1953's ""War Arrow"" is Fort Clark in West Texas near Brackettville during the Indian Wars of the late 19th century. Major Brady (Jeff Chandler) arrives from D.C. to utilize a small band of transplanted Seminoles to aid the US Army against the marauding Kiowas. Brady conflicts with the Colonel of the fort (John McIntire) and romances a redheaded widow (Maureen O'Hara) while a Seminole woman takes interest in him (Suzan Ball).

Chandler was 33 during filming and is great as the masculine protagonist with Hollywood looks, but his greying hair makes him look at least a decade older. Sadly, he'd be dead in less than ten years due to a botched surgery. McIntire as the by-the-book and jealous CO is odious, but maybe redeemable.

The women, O'Hara and Ball, are another highlight. Maureen was 32 during filming and looked great, but she's one of those women who became more exquisite as she got older (to a point, that is). In the early 60s she was one of the most beautiful women to walk the face of the planet. In ""War Arrow"" she hadn't reached her voluptuous peak yet and she was hardly a good actress at the time, but it is interesting to see her when she was younger. Just as beautiful - and perhaps even more so - was the rising brunette Suzan Ball. She was only 18 during filming and is just stunning as the Seminole Avis. Sadly, she would pass away a mere two years after ""War Arrow"" was released due to cancer.

Another positive for me is the Agoura, CA, locations, which - surprisingly - are a decent stand-in for West Texas. In any event, the film has a great Western ""look.""

Unfortunately, the film loses points due to using white actors in the main Native roles, like Dennis Weaver as the Seminole brave who loves Avis and Henry Brandon as Avis' father, Maygro, not to mention Ball as Avis. But this is forgivable since this was the standard practice of the time and there were no Native actors available. Less forgivable is the stereotypical portrayal of the Indians (the haltingly way they speak English, dancing around the fire and the music), but actually it's not as bad as you would think.

The biggest negative is the old-style of filmmaking of Westerns at the time. This is clearly a Hollywoodized portrayal of the Old West that could never be mistaken for reality. Yet there are a number of Westerns that broke out of the these limitations of the era, like 1950's excellent ""The Sundowners"" (not to be confused with the 1960 film of the same name) and 1956's ""The Last Wagon,"" both of which rank with my favorite Westerns of all time. I point this out to show that some Westerns rose to the top in the 1930s thru 1950s, but ""War Arrow"" wasn't one of them. Still, it's certainly worth catching for the positives noted above. For me, it's like going back in time and is enjoyable for this alone.

The film runs 78 minutes.

8011938,2,B0001FVDXC,"I bought this film because of Jeff Chandler.  I just watched about half of it and realized I was trying very hard to enjoy it.  What prevented me from
enjoying it was the poor production and even worse direction.  The film is loaded with talent, but they were not given good lines, there was absolutely no effort made to cast even one real Indian (unless you can keep a straight face watching Dennis Weaver trying hard to convince us he was an Indian)  To watch this, one has to keep in mind the decade in which the film was created, but even that failed to create any illusion of reality.  You can almost see the actors trying to make the best of the material they were given to work with.

So sorry to disagree with all who love this film.  It might work for children, but I felt nothing but disappointment to see so many fine actors wasted on a weak story line and essentially no support from the writers, producer and director.

8011943,4,B0001FVDXC,"Another excellent Western from the decade of the 1950s when the Western was king. This is a Cavalry Western, starring Jeff Chandler as an innovative Major who uses Seminole warriors to augment his troopers to fight the Kiowa. He runs afoul of the commander of the commanding Colonel (John McIntire) of Fort Carson where he's been assigned as a troubleshooter...and meets and falls in love with a beautiful widow (Maureen O'Hara). That will set the stage...watch it to see how it plays out. The fiery Irish redhead plays second fiddle to Chandler in this, one of her many Westerns; but her character is still very prominent...and it turns out she may not be a widow after all. Chandler performs superbly, as he always did before his untimely death after a botched surgery at the age of 41. Also look for Charles Drake and Noah Beery, Jr as Major Brady's right hand men; Dennis Weaver, in his pre-""Gunsmoke"" days, as one of the Seminole warriors; and Jay Silverheels (Tonto in ""The Lone Ranger"") as the Kiowa Chief, Santanta. Westerns are my favorite genre and I love this one...if you feel the same about Westerns, I'm betting you'll love it too!",1477785600,4,1145,4.758793969849246
