8191174,5,B000PGKZUE,"If this is the 1973 movie originally titled Nippon Chinbotsu, it is considered one of the best disaster films by critics. The 1975 American release of the film titled;""Tidal Wave"" dubbed in Lorne Green in scenes and was a flop to critics. You would be best viewing this original version with English subtitles if you like and see the movie as it was meant to be. The newest a few years back is not even worth seeing. The plot was about as amazing as a kick in the pants.",1456876800,,470,4.292134831460674
8191175,1,B000PGKZUE,"Yes, I bought this flick from other site for 1 cent plus shipping. Yes, I hoped for an entertainment of some kind--mistake, instead it is perfect propaganda of ministry of....Sure, government is trying to convince me they doing best they can and have resources and ability and desire. Hm, does reality support this idea? Never. Should I rely my expectations on my life experience or on propaganda? Avoid.",1393545600,,404,4.955882352941177
8191176,4,B000PGKZUE,"I enjoyed this movie. Like the  modern disaster films it focuses on a small group of characters, which you get to care about. The special effects are very good. It is in Japanese but it also comes with English subtitles among others languages.",1356912000,,243,4.651162790697675
8191177,2,B000PGKZUE,"I watched this film before reading the novel and already then I didn't like it much - but once I read the book, I realised that the director completely changed both the story and the message which figured in the novel, and it was a change to worse.

As it is rather clear by simply looking on the cover, this is the story of a great cataclysm, which threatens Japan - and it is so serious, that the very existence of the country can be jeopardized! The governement and the citizens struggle to find ways to react to this threat, but the time is short, and as the story progresses, it is getting even shorter.

Now, I was maybe too spoiled by films like 'Deep Impact"", ""Day after tomorrow"", ""Dante's Peak"", ""The last day of the dinosaurs"" and ""2012"", but the cataclysm in this film didn't impress me much. Such a monstrous event should be filmed with more means and more effects, or abandon the effects and focus entirely on human side of the tragedies - but the director tried to show the cataclysm clearly without having both the budget and the know-how and the result is poor. As for the human dimension, it is even less well shown, due mostly to the wooden performance of most of the actors and a rather poor scenario.

I found that the film lacked the tension which is almost unsufferable in the novel and also didn't give enough screen time to the politicians who in the novel play a much more important role. The efforts to evacuate Japanese population abroad, and especially to find FUNDS and MEANS to not only transport 120 million people but also provide them with at least a modest capital to start all over again in foreign lands were an important element in the success of the novel and it was possible to film some of those very dramatic negotiations and plots without much budget - but the director decided against it. Which is a pity.

For reasons which I can not comprehend, the director also decided to completely change the vision of politicians. In the novel they were shown as rather average and sometimes even mediocre people, who nevertheless in the time of unprecedented crisis do their job the best they can and some of them, considered usually as weaklings and puppets, find a surprising force and nobility in those circumstances. The film takes a radically different approach showing amongst some of them an almost irrational level of bad will and incompetence, like in the worse moments of cheap Hollywood disaster flicks. The character of completely incompetent acting Prime Minister Nozaki is here particularly mistreated, as in the novel Nozaki was a discreet and very average, almost grey and dusty bureaucrat, but who nevertheless negotiated efficiently the resettlement of Japanese in a great number of initially rather unfriendly countries.

A little detail about the cover - yes, there are some fighter planes taking off regularly during this film - but what exactly are they supposed to do against volcanoes and tsunamis, I am unable to say. Nobody tries to stop the evacuation, therefore the regular repetition of scenes with the fighter planes is just a waste of screen time.

The political correctness asked for introduction of a female minister, Takamori, who must be (of course!) the only competent politician. Also, Reiko, who in the book is a rather troubled, lazy and spoiled young heiress, here is transformed in a daring helicopter pilot...)))

The ending is totally and radically different from the one in the novel and in my modest opinion it hurts this film most cruelly.

So bottom line, as far as my personal taste is concerned, this film failed mostly as a disaster movie and failed TOTALLY as adaptation of this great classic of Japanese SF which was Sakyo Komatsu's ""Japan sinks"".",1348617600,3,3734,4.778294573643411
8191178,5,B000PGKZUE,"This movie is well done, very good story line, special effect well done, acting some of the best. This one of the best japanese movies that I have seen. The only problem is the subtitles, some times you can not read them they fade into the movie backgrown. I give the movie 5 out of 5 stars",1335571200,,290,4.105263157894737
