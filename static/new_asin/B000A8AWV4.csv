8076316,2,B000A8AWV4,"Based on Mary Higgins Clark book, one expects better.  Director did not do a good job.  Eastwood gets confronted by Svenson's character with a gun and she does't even react.  He shoots her in the shoulder and she grabs her stomach...can't act her way out of a paper bag.  Old pros Margot Kidder and Bo Svenson are very good, given what they have to work with",1411862400,,358,4.378787878787879
8076317,1,B000A8AWV4,"This movie didn't do justice to the book, nor the acting ability of Alison Eastwood.",1279843200,,84,4.666666666666667
8076318,1,B000A8AWV4,"It deserves absolutely NO stars!  The acting is atrocious.  The heroine speaks in a monotone, ho-hum voice throughout the entire movie, whether she's discussing running the dude ranch w/ her mother, identifying a dead body, or being attacked by a maniac.  She would have been a shoe-in for a role on NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.
  Her mother looks like she must have had her when she was about four!  And talk about homely!  No wonder the missing dad had another family living in Arizona (ugh!)  Apparently he was also messing around with some old German hag from his workplace, too (who the mother actually calls ""beautiful"" when she sees her picture in the paper).
  The so-called hero-boyfriend had actually broken up with our heroine a couple of years before and married someone else, whom he now refers to as ""the mistake.""
  The list could go on, but I'll close with saying that my copy of this movie is in the trash where it belongs.",1221523200,,930,4.672839506172839
8076319,5,B000A8AWV4,"This was a wonderful movie and I enjoyed it.  I've read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books, so this was a bonus for me seeing it on DVD.  I'd love seeing more of her books on DVD.",1219536000,,178,3.7837837837837838
