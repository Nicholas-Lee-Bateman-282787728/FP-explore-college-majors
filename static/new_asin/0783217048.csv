46024,5,0783217048,"I'm embarrassed to say that I'd never even heard of this movie until recently when reading Patrick's book ""The Time of my Life."" He said he had an amazingly fun time making this movie and getting in touch with his feminine side.

I can see why.

Being fully supportive of the LGBT community and absolutely loving drag queens and Patrick Swayze I had to give this movie a look and I'm glad I did. I laughed more than I have in months but there is a lot more to the story than just three men dressing up and pretending to be divas.

It's hard for people to get accepted for being who they truly are and want to be and no matter ever you go, there'll always be someone who will not accept you simply because of this or that. This movie can be very uplifting for people like that. It'll even melt your heart and put a tear in your eye in some scenes.

Swayze and Snipes win a drag show as a tie to go to California and run into a crying Leguizamo who idolizes them.  Swayze and Snipes decide to turn their plane ticket into another way to get to the pageant (all 3 of them).  They finally end up buying an old convertible which breaks down near a town that looks deserted.  The part to fix the car will take several days to come in so they are welcome to stay at a bed and breakfast until then.  A policeman is after them and has 1 shoe of a very large size to try to pin one of them.

I'm pretty sure he really is a hot Latino woman.  Julie Newmar looks more like a drag queen than they do!

46195,5,0783217048,"I remember this from when I was younger and its still hilarious today. Patrick Swayze does a fantastic portrayal and is absolutely gorgeous, John Leguizamo is so beautiful as Chi Chi that the first time I saw this movie when I was in high school I thought they'd gotten an actual woman to pretend to be a drag queen, that's how gorgeous. Wesley Snipes just adds a level of comedy to things that is amazing, because he's proof that no matter how much you might want to be in a dress, unfortunately, some men, are just built in a way that it's entirely too obvious and almost comical. The three characters together and their journey which is doomed from the moment they pull out of the used car lot is just hilarious.

For its era, it paints a picture of things that we're still dealing with. Fear, lack of understanding, homophobia, and acceptance. And the last one is key, because acceptance comes from a place and from people that seem the least likely in the world to ever be accepting of things like homosexuality and drag, but that's what makes it great, they're painted as being back waters, different, country, and simple, when in reality, it's these 'simple' people that have the greatest understanding of what friendship and acceptance means, and that's a message that is worth listening to, along with the hilarity.",1470096000,2,1324,4.682403433476395

46426,5,0783217048,"Unexpectedly stranded enroute on a cross country trip, three drag queens discover the inhabitants of a small southern town are more than meets the eye.

If you've seen Doc Hollywood, you largely know the base plot for this move. It's a little more edgy of course.

A redneck sheriff becomes proactively determined to wipe out ""the freaks"" from existence. He's originally was be played for laughs. But against both recent political attacks and heightened concerns about law enforcement conduct, these scenes are quite chilling.

The only person who really cannot pull off this movie is John Leguizamo. Yes, he gives it his best shot. And he shows what people might go through as gender identity develops.  But he largely gives the impression of a hooker who is selling his body on a 'old' Times Square street corner for something.  I don't care how enthusiastic he was about the role.

No way Vida (Patrick Swayze) would associate with the likes of Chi-Chi. Sorry, it's just not going to happen here. Swayze is apparently the 'leader' of the gang, perhaps because he looks the most comfortable in drag.

The only extras are deleted scenes. I was really disappointed they did not include more. This was a really good film about building bridges in difficult situations.",1440806400,,1267,4.92018779342723

46479,5,0783217048,"Fabulous darling, this movie is simply fabulous. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a comedy with more intelligent humor than a kick to the crotch or people running into sliding glass doors, not that that isn't hilarious. With actors like Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo youd think this would be an amped up action movie loaded with guns and gore. Its actually quite the opposite. To Wong Foo, thanks for the memories, Julie Newmar, or simply to Wong Foo is a comedy cult movie in which you get to see these macho actors trade in their guns for glitter and gore for garters. Thats right ladies and gentleman, they're drag queens. And if that wasn't enough they play it off so convincingly youd think they always had boas on their biceps. Ive watched this movie several times with different people and many of them from time to time forget that the actors are men. I still forget that they are men from time to time.
  The story in its simplest form is about three drag queens well two drag queens Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) and Noxzema Jackson (Wesley Snipes) accompanied by a drag princess Chi-Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo), who go on a road trip together from Manhattan to Los Angeles to compete in the Miss Drag Queen of America beauty pageant. Along the way, however, high-jinx inevitably ensues. They have a run-in with the antagonist cop Officer Dollard and soon after their car breaks down leaving them stuck in the middle of nowhere until its fixed with nothing to do but fix the problems of the local residents and paint the town red. Almost literally but most assuredly, fabulously.
  Some basic information you might want to know before going into this movie is that its rated pg-13, is considered a comedy, and has of course, drag queens. This movie is 1 hour and 49 minutes in length, being just long enough that its not a rushed movie and not too long that those with a shorter attention span start to wonder if the movie will ever end. In truth, though, its one of those movies that you wish wouldnt end. The movie was also directed by Beeban Kidron, if that means anything to you.
This movie is hilarious. If you liked The Bird Cage you're going to like this. Its comedy is a little more toned down as it seems to focuses a little more on the story than The Bird Cage, but I think its still more fabulous anyway. I know it might seem immature to some, but drag queens make me laugh. Nothing against them, I adore them, but they do, they just do. So in the comedy department To Wong Foo with Jonh Leguizamo in cha-cha heels beats out the already flamboyantly feminine Nathan Lane, as comical as he was.
What I like most about this movie though is that it touches on issues most movies like to shy away from, starting with the obvious gender issue, it covers abuse, and even touches on prejudice in the police force. The characters are very much the image of, Im here and Im queer so get used to it.  But they aren't always an invincible pillar of confidence and energy. They get shaken up, they get scared, they get and sad. They tear themselves down but also lift themselves up, they love, they feel, they get angry. The movie did an excellent job of, without blatantly saying it, conveying to the viewer that even though they are drag queens they are people. They struggle but they persevere, they grow as people yet still remain who they are. They each have their own personalities and backgrounds and morals and unique reactions to the same problems we encounter, simply in a different form, in everyday life.  This movie makes you want to meet and get to know these characters personally.
  Plus just watching it you can tell the actors had loads of fun making this movie; you can see it in almost every scene. Especially Wesley Snipes: you know he had a great time the whole time. That itself is an extra bonus, when I can tell the actors had fun, that energy sort of pings in me and I share the fun with them, making the experience that much better.

46766,5,0783217048,"This is a favorite whenever we need a big laugh and a peek at some of the best actors in Hollywood in totally off-the-wall roles.  In particular, Robin Williams' just-over-two minute appearance as John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt almost walks off with the movie, but the three stars are fabulous as are the ladies of the small town their car is towed to for repairs.  Blythe Danner and Stockard Channing are always perfect (how do they look so unchanged after all these years in movies?  A little nip-and-tuck, healthy living, doing what they love and are so good at?  Share, ladies.) as are all the bit players.  The cop with his own difficulties with sexuality is wonderful as the obsessed hunter, as are the young actors who play the residents of the village.  The final denoument with Julie Newmar herself couldn't be more appropriate, and the movie is a welcome treat over and over.  Watch it sometime alongside ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert"" and appreciate its gentleness by comparison.  If you're a movie buff, there is much to enjoy as well, and the pop culture references are totally perfect.  Don't miss Patrick, Wesley and John as the best drag queens ever.

Swayze brings a genuine sincerity to his role, one that couldn't be pulled off by someone simply mocking the idea of a drag queen. It's a simple story pulled off with lots of make up, class, and je ne sais quois with lots of nods to Hollywood's past. I loved it.

Stalled at a small town, they teach the townspeople how we are all human and we should overlook our differences.

I will never, ever forget my first viewing of To Wong Foo, as we call it in my house.  I laughed often, and felt good afterward, and knew I had to own it even though (and maybe because) it was a wee bit campy.

My kids, who are now 18 and 21, also love to watch this movie again and again, we pull it out every 3 to six months and enjoy it just as much as in the beginning... even though we can all recite most of the lines.  ""Oooh, girl... did you just do a U-ie?!"" Can't help but adore Wesley Snipes as Noxema Jackson.  :)  The same is true of Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo in their respective roles - the guys were firmly ensconced in their manly man archetypes, and they took a chance on doing something so completely out of character that it was possible it could kill the public perception of them forever.

  I have an extensive movie collection.  As might be expected, some stand out ""head above the crowd"" as favorites.  TO WONG FOO THANKS FOR EVERYTHING  is one of two I put at the top of the (light/funny/ease the stress) list.  Patrick Swayze is absolutely one of the most memorable women I've ever seen.  He is not a man playing a woman....he IS a woman.  (It reminds me of a scene in the Broadway show RHINOCEROS, when I saw the actor sitting in front of an imaginary mirror putting on his stage make-up - and he did not turn himself into someone pretending to be a rhino - he BECAME the animal.  This is like that.  Memorable.  The other actors also do an incredible job.  Wesley Snipes is as funny as I've ever seen him.  And ""the little Latin boy"" is just as amazing.  Perfect casting in a funny movie that carries a worthwhile message - and makes you laugh while it's giving you something to think about.

47141,5,0783217048,"A must have favorite, inspired by, and in competition for ""who can make the best drag queen movie"" I think, ""Priscilla: Queen of the Desert"", an Aussie film, and IMO, this movie outdoes it's predecessor by miles. Personally, I didn't care for ""Priscilla"" at all, as it was too campy, and the storyline, and plot were very weak, unlike 'To Wong Foo...', which features a truly moving theme, plot, storyline, character insight, everything that I felt Priscilla just didn't quite live up too.

One, Leguizamo is a natural in himself, *the ""little latin boy in drag""*, and Swayze and Snipes are phenomenol.
Leguizamo truly proves his acting chops in this movie, taking his character to areas I've never seen him go. He really put his heart into this character, I can tell, and did so seamlessly, against the backdrop of vertaran co stars, Snipes, and Swayze.
The premise of the movie, albeit a comedy, has plenty of drama, suspense, and I feel although not a film for everyone, especially the conservative ""Christian"" Right Wing, still, it touches on everyone's everyday lives.
Not too outlandish, but a few scenes being a bit far fetched, yet with a campy comedic relief, to let you know it's purposeful, the movie has an excellent storyline, and plot.
In a brief synopsis:
3 New York drag queens, 2 that have been tied for 1st place at a GALA pageant, essentially a ""Miss America"" pagaent, drag queen style, decide to take along the 'little latin boy in drag', as they have named him, as a protoge, and wind up purchasing an vintage Cadillac for the trip cross country, from New York to Hollywood. Well, of course the car breaks down, and then the real fun starts, as they find themselves rescued by a young man, who drives the stranded ""career girls"" home to 'Snyderville' Nebraska, population...about 10. LOL...
Well, with the one liners, the other supporting cast with their own identities, and problems, including a battered wife, an alchoholic, and an elderly woman who is by all appearances, deaf, dumb, and well...you'll see.

Over the course of a weekend, the 3 'career girls' take Snyderville by the horns, and turn it onto it's side. By the end of the movie, you're left with a warm feeling in your heart, that drives home the fact that while we may all have our differences, the human spirit, nourished by the power of love and humanity, overcomes any and all obstacles. Even when you trip up on your size 13 high heels.",1288051200,8,2429,4.739952718676123

Patrick Swayze pulls off his role with stunning ease, making you forget that there is really a man under the make up, women's clothes, and wig. Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo tackle their roles with the same enthusiasm and manage to be equally as charming and convincing.

The movie tackles domestic violence in an understated fashion, showing a woman who is cowed and bullied but eventually, with the help of three ""women"" who have a courage she lacks, finds that courage and stands up to the coward that abuses her.

There's a little bit of romance, a little bit of action, more than a little drama. There is, quite literally, something for everyone in this movie. It's great for a lot of laughs, a couple of tears, and just a really great movie night at home.

47226,4,0783217048,"""To Wong Foo"" presents a rose-colored view of the world in which all of our problems can be solved if we just tap

into our inner fabulousness! Why, even the problems of  seriously abused housewife CarolAnne (Stockard Channing) are cheerfully swept under the rug. I am not blaming the movie for its optimistic life view and colorful hues. It helps the poor abused Carol Ann that drag Queen Vita Boheme (Patrick Swayze) appears as her ""angel"" and lays some serious smack down on her pig of a husband (Arliss Howard).

 Three drag Queen ends up stranded in some un-named fictional, backwater Podunk town  when their Convertible breaks down en route from New York to Hollywood. The ladies, naturally, end up transforming the lives of everybody in town over the course of a single, magical weekend. The ladies are pursued by racist, homophobic Sheriff Dollard (the late Chris Penn) who, we discover in a funny bar scene, is a major closet case!

  The premise is slight, but the performances are outstanding. Your enjoyment of the film may depend on how  you respond to the leading (heterosexual) men playing the leading (gay men in drag) ladies. Snipes (as Noxemi Jackson)  and Leguizamo are especially excellent at  bringing their inner Drag Queens out. John Leguizamo is outstanding as Chi Chi Rodreiguiz.  The role of Vita Boheme represents a major change of pace for Swayze, previously known for macho roles in ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""RoadHouse."" Swayze is only half as convincing and successful as Snipes and Leguizamo, but the good news ladies and gentlemen is that he is every bit as sexy and attractive as Lady Vita Boheme as  he is as a man (himself). Hey, I'm not asking Swayze to give me the moon here. He really is very good. Robin Williams also makes a fun and funny cameo appearance.

  ""To Wong Foo"" is so optimistic it might as well be a Disney movie, ""The Wizard Of Oz"" or ""The Sound Of Music."" I'm all for films about self-esteem and self-empowerment, as long as the viewer realizes that this level of rosy self-empowerment can be achieved in movies but seldom in real life. This is a perfect movie to watch if your feeling depressed. This movie made me smile and laugh when I was experiencing severe depressions.

 I cracked up in uncontrollable laughter when Swayze said, ""Oh, what in gay hell?"" (is this? as Penn's car is seen behind them on the road). ""To Wong Foo"" is gay in every sense of the word (emphasis on bright, sunny, colorful, happy) and there is certainly nothing wrong with that.  Say ""Amen.""",1177804800,2,2521,4.727688787185355

The movie can be empowering, funny, touching, and/or intense, depending on your perspective. An abused woman finds a friend in a most unlikely individual. Knowing full-well ""she"" was really a man, and yet she allowed a friendship to grow. Cool! An old woman in a dinky tiny town, who had given up on life, found friendship in the tallest, muscle bound, gentile black woman (Wesley Snipes), that she had ever seen (or ever would). If you think about each and every character in the small town, you realize what those three drag queens symbolically brought and left with them.

47232,4,0783217048,"This is Pricilla: Queen of the Desert set in Texas. But gosh...this movie's just so cute. Attacking this film is like going after a defenseless bunny with a bazooka.  Most of the jokes are funny and the actors actually sort of look like women. Sort of.

Actually, Leguizamo as the Latin cross-dresser Chi-chi is so feminine it's insane. His performance is reason enough to see this movie, seriously. He got all the mannerisms and body movements spot-on. Chi-chi gets all the best lines (I got more legs than a bucket of chicken) and just steals the whole movie. Buff action hero Wesley Snipes, prancing around a stage trying to look like a woman. He could be the greatest actor in the universe and I still wouldn't buy him as a drag queen. In fact, with his bulging muscles he's pretty ridiculous. He's still better than I expected (Swayze is worse). There's this drag queen competition, and the winner gets to go to the drag nationals in Hollywood. Vida (Swayze), Noxeema (Snipes, don't ask) & Chi-Chi (Leguizamo) all enter but the winner comes out at a tie: Vida and Noxeema are both going to Hollywood, baby. Sorry Chi-chi.

After an encounter in a stairwell with Chi-chi, who is pouting like a sad chihuahua, Vida decides on a whim to bring Chi-chi along for the trip. Since they're short one plane ticket and Noxeema is too big a diva to be seen riding a bus, they all go out and buy the crappiest Cadillac you've ever seen and sort of hope it will get them from New York to L.A. The trio gets pulled over (again, in full drag for some reason) by a seedy sheriff (Chris Penn) who tries to feel up Vida and as a reward gets bashed in the face. If he stood five inches from Patrick Swayze in drag and just said ""Dang, you're tall"", then he deserved it. Predictably, the Cadillac breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and the drag queens all have to flee to the nearest town until it gets fixed and they can get going to Hollywood. The town of Snydersville is smaller than my high school gym. It's a bunch of wooden ramshackle buildings that look like they were airlifted in. It's full of classy actresses like Blythe Danner and Stockard Channing who act like total hayseeds.

Leguizamo for his part is 120% convincing as a loser drag queen. I almost sniffled a little too at the Coca-cola scene. He's the only one I bought as a woman, which is funny because he's supposed to be the most inexperienced of the three, and the other two (who are dogs) keep lecturing him on how to graduate from 'drag princess' to a queen. Chris Penn's retarded villain is the only low point. Robin Williams is in there, awesome as ever, even though he only gets one scene. Highly reccomend, if only to rent it once (Then if you like it, rent Pricilla afterward). Go ahead, it won't make you less of a man. I think.",1156204800,4,2797,4.45703125

47249,3,0783217048,"For the first 1/3 of 'Wong Foo,' the film delivers a gender-bending road trip at a brisk pace.  Everything from the moment gal pals, Vida(Swayze) and Nozema(Snipes) meet drag queen-in-training Chi Chi(Luguizamo) to the instant car trouble forces them to stay in that dusty western town is funny and magical.  To that point, it's all about these three, and they are undoubtedly the most interesting characters in the film.  The second 2/3 aims at being heartwarming and even a tad philosophical as the trio improves the drab, even desperate, lives of the inhabitants.  Maybe that's why I wished that the road trip would have continued and that their break-down was brief; as a glitzy, campy drag show on wheels (a-la 'Priscilla, queen of The Desert), wong Foo is a wonderfully entertaining comedy but as a mini-drama, its pacing and humor are as stalled as that old yellow Cadillac.  On the whole, Swayze's Vida is a believable-looking and acting drag character played with depth and sensitivity.  Snipes' Noxzema is somewhat less believable in looks and mannerism, and is limited to acidic quips and drag platitudes.  Leguizamo's Chi-Chi is high camp, even for drag queens, but her girlish enthusiasm and petulance is well-developed. The music, costumes and characters are colorful and interesting, despite the overly-long breakdown sequence.

This movie shows the true depth of Patrick Swayze's acting! He is fabulous in this movie; Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo also did a very good job. This movie is primarily a comedy with some touching moments thrown in. A look at life from a different point of view. Well worth seeing more than once!!

  ""Too Wong Foo"" is more than worth watching, especially for the performances and the countless cameos. Kudos to all the stars for taking the risk and bringing this story on screen, and for giving performances that dare Hollywood stereotypes about ""star image,"" when there was no Will & Grace. John Leguizamo walks away with the movie, effortlessly. If Naomi Campbell was a dragqueen, she'd be Wesley Snipes -- sure enough, she's the one who taught him how to walk in heels, rumor has it. Patrick Swayze has great moments, at times elegant, and then at times reminds one of Jack Lemon in ""Some Like it Hot."" What can you say about Stockard Channing except that she wins your heart.  Among the most memorable cameos, the innimitable Robin Williams. And if you watch the camera pan in that same scene, you might chuckle as you catch a glimpse of none other than George Costacos.

Patrick Swazye, Wesley Snipes, & John Leguizamo star in this outrageously hilarious comedy entitled, TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING! JULIE NEWMAR. where Girls Just Want To Have Fun & Attitude  Is Everything.

  VIDA BOHEME (played by Patrick Swazye) & NOXEEMA JACKSON (played by Wesley Snipes) are two ""girlfriends"", who appear to be drag queens, competing in New York's ""Drag Queen Of The Year"" competition. Competing with Vida and Noxeema is the Latin-flavored, CHI CHI RODRIGQUEZ (played by John Leguizamo. Announcing the winner of the competion is RACHEL TENSIONS (played by RuPaul). Turns out, there is no winner. There are two winners. The winners are...Vida Boheme and Noxeema Jackson. Their prize is two all-expense-paid plane tickets to Hollywood, CA, where they will compete in the Drag Queen Of America contest.

  While walking up the stairs of their apartment building, Vida and Noxeema meet Chi Chi face to face. Chi Chi is upset because ""she"" feels that ""she"" is not pretty enough. They decide to take Chi Chi with them to Hollywood as their protege. They stop at a diner for some food, where Vida sees an autographed picture of Julie Newmar. The autograph reads: ""To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar"". Vida takes the picture with ""her"" on their trip to Hollywood. They trade in their tickets and buy a 1967 Cadillac Convertable and head out on their way.

  On the way, the ""girls"" stop in Bala Cynwood, PA, Vida's hometown, where they stop outside of Vida's old home, where ""her"" parents are still residing. His mother looks out, becomes ashamed, and turns around. A little spiff sturs up between Chi Chi and the others, leading them into informing Chi Chi that ""she"" is not a drag queen, but just a little Latin boy in a dress. They pretty much name ""her"" a drag princess, having to go through four steps of becoming a full-fledged drag queen.

  Late that night, they are pulled over by SHERIFF DOLLARD (played by Chris Penn), pulling them over for a broken tail light. He takes Vida out of the car and begins feeling ""her"" up, until Dollard feels a little something more than he should have felt on a real woman. Vida knocks him out, where she and the others flee the are in a heartbeat.

  They pull over into a rest stop, get changed, and head out on their way, but their car won't start. Chi Chi wants to leave, but the others won't let ""her"", forcing Vida to take Chi Chi's Princess Points from passing the first two steps. That is when Chi Chi decides to hitch hike. Hitchhiking should be easy since Chi Chi claims that, ""...I'm the Latina Marilyn Monroe. I got more legs than a bucket of chicken..."" Chi Chi finds a ride with BOBBY RAY (played by Jason London). He is a resident of Syndersville. They pick up Vida and Noxeema, and head out to Snydersville. CAROL ANN (played by Stockard Channing) and VIRGIL run a boarding house, where Virgil is a mechanic. Virgil will start work on their car in the morning, while the ""girls"" spend the night. The next morning, the whole town is outside, looking at the three queens. Virgil reveals that the car won't be finished until the forthcoming Monday, forcing the three to remain in Snydersville over the weekend.

  In this town, they meet, BOBBY LEE (played by Jennifer Millmore), who is Carol Ann and Virgil's daughter, BEATRICE (played by Blythe Danner), MERNA (played by Melinda Dillan), CLARA (played by Alice Drummond), who befriends Noxeema, since they love the old films from the 1940s, LORETTA (played by Beth Grant), and KATINA (played by Marceline Hugot). Vida befriends both Carol Ann and Bobby Lee, where Chi Chi falls for Bobby Ray. During the afternoon, Vida and Noxeema help the girls plan their strawberry social for the next morning.

  That night, Bobby Ray goes to ask Chi Chi to the next morning's strawberry social. Bobby Lee is upset at that fact, since she is also in love with Bobby Ray. Chi Chi and Vida argue bitterly about it, until Vida goes upstairs to stop a fight between Carol Ann and Virgil, for Virgil is abusive. Vida gives Virgle his own medicine and kicks him out, where Carol Ann, Vida, and Noxeema celebrate with each other for Vida having done what ""she"" did. Chi Chi decides that it is more important for Bobby Lee to be with Bobby Ray, where Vida and Noxeema let Chi Chi know that ""she"" has just passed step 3.

  The next day, Sheriff Dollard and Virgile enter Syndersville and plan to arrest the drag queens, but the town covers for them. They have their strawberry social, and they are on their way to Hollywood, after the car is finally fixed. Chi Chi wins the Drag Queen Of America contest. Presenting the award is...JULIE NEWMAR (played by Herself).

  This movie had me laughing my a** off from start to finish. Patrick Swayze was not that great in this film, but luckily, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo were the ones to help make the picture a laughing riot. Most people have reviewed this movie as garbage. Those people are afraid to say they liked because of how most people can be judgemental over others who like this movie, just because of three guys only dressing this way for the pay of the movie. Let me tell you that you don't need to be a woman to like this film. If you like this film, whether you are male or female, then you like this film. There is no difference.

Carolann(Stockard Channing) reminded me of other girls I knew who used to get beat up by their men. And I thought ""man I've been through this also."" I've been the one who wants to help them. And just having other gay friends who think only of themselves which is what Wesley Snipes character does. And i have been in the one to fall in love with a guy who is unattainable, like Chi Chi's character. And i usually have to give them up or leave them behind. So i can really identifiy with these characters. I am glad I got it and really got to understand it too. The only thing is I don't look that good in Drag ha ha ha!

I think it's incredibly fantastic that these three A-List actors had the courage to take on the roles of drag queens, because it takes alot to fill such glamorous shoes, especially when two of the three actors are known for playing such macho roles!

47281,5,0783217048,"This film, with an intriguing but somewhat unwieldy title, tends to be compared with another film with a very similar plot: The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Critics (especially Australian ones) love to point out similarities in plot, except that Priscilla does it so much better, and in a less sentimental, hackneyed and clich-ridden way. However, I really enjoy To Wong Foo..., and don't necessarily think of it as being inferior to Priscilla.

Two drag queens, Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) and Noxzeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes) jointly win the first prize in a local drag queen beauty contest in New York City - this wins them the cost of the travel expenses to Hollywood, California and back to allow them to participate in a national competition.

Another contestant, Chi Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo) is devastated that she did not win. Taking pity on her, Vida convinces Noxzeema to let Chi Chi accompany them - by trading in the plane tickets for a used car. Through the help of a cameo appearance by Robin Williams, they obtain an old Cadillac convertible with more style than substance (which you just know will break down in the middle of nowhere).

On the way, the stop by at Vida's hometown, join a ladies' basketball convention, and have a very close encounter with a red-necked highway cop - Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn)! Then, as you would have guessed, the car breaks down and the queens are left stranded until they get rescued by a ""knight in a shiny pickup truck"" - innocent wide-eyed Bobby Ray (Jason London) who hails from the small town of Snydersville.

Unable to get spare parts for the Cadillac over the weekend, the trio are stranded in Snydersville over the weekend. Gradually, they get to know the inhabitants of the hamlet, but will the local folks ever find out that the three ""career girls"" from New York City are not quite what they seem? In turn, how will the trio affect the lives of the various people, including local hotel owner Carol Ann (Stockard Channing) who is being abused and beaten by her husband Virgil (Arliss Howard)?

Part of the film's charm (or irritation, depending on your point of view) is its relentless ""wholesomeness."" Indeed, apart from a minor plot detail (cross-dressing), this could have been a Doris Day film. It seems eager to preach a message of tolerance and goodwill: tolerance/acceptance of alternative lifestyles, racism, small town vs. big city prejudices, relationships between men and women, and even differences across the generation gap.

I'm sure some people went to see this film just to find out how (through the magic of film-making and lots of make-up) three rather butch and handsome actors look dressed up as women. I must admit, they look darned good - and of course the film helps by making the ""real"" women in the cast look as dowdy as possible.

Many critics have commented on how studiously the plot avoids any hint of sex on the part of the three main characters, to the point where the film got awarded a PG-13 rating in the US (PG in Australia). We are supposed to believe that three red-blooded drag queens go on a road trip and ... nothing happens, apart from a bit of coquettish flirting from Chi Chi. Instead, the three somehow turn into relentless do-gooders that transform the lives of those they come into contact with.

Then again, maybe the critics are just simply not reading the sub-text of the plot hard enough. After all, the film pretty much articulates what I suspect is a typical male cross dresser's fantasy - to be able to dress as a woman 100% of the time in public, to actually look beautiful and draw the attraction of passing males, and finally to be accepted by society.

There are some nice cameo appearances by real life drag queen RuPaul, supermodel Naomi Campbell, plus the real Julie Newmar.",1103846400,7,3824,4.790591805766312
47282,4,0783217048,"""To Wong Foo"" seemed horribly miscast when you found out who was in it ... I mean, John Leguizamo had done drag before, proving himself to be very convincing and most definitely in touch with his ""feminine side"" -- but Wesley Snipes and Patrick Swayze??!  Two macho movie stars pulling off parts as drag queens on a road trip?
But then you saw the movie ...
The three men do excellent jobs, Wesley Snipes in particular a total surprise in his role as Noxeema Jackson, drag queen with Attitude.  Swayze, as Vida Boheme, is the ""lady"" of the trio who can get down and dirty when she has to -- and Leguziamo as Chi Chi Rodriguez is nothing short of perfection.
The plot is simple:  At New York's Drag Queen of the Year contest, Noxeema and Vida tie for the crown.  The title comes with a free airline ticket to Los Angeles, to compete in the Drag Queen of America competition, and the two ""girls"" couldn't be more excited.  But then they meet little Latin Chi Chi Rodriguez, whose drag queen self-esteem was not at all helped by losing this competition.  Vida, the kind of person who always believes in helping those less fortunate, talks a VERY disgruntled Noxeema into selling their plane tickets ... and using the money instead to buy a cheap car and drive to the L.A. contest.  The night of the win, Vida spots an autographed photo of Miss Julie Newmar on the wall of the reataurant they are dining in, and reads the inscription:  ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar"".  For those not in the know ... for years actress/model Julie Newmar, best known for her role at Catwoman on the tv series ""Batman,"" has had rumors floating around saying that she's a drag queen in real life -- not a woman.  She's just too statuesque, her face too strong on bone structure, to be a real woman!  When Vida sees the framed autographed photo on the wall, she takes this as a sign that the three of them will be blessed on their quest.  She also takes the photograph.
Halfway 'cross country, in Nebraska, the threesome is stopped by a racist sheriff who notices their tail light is out.  Taking Vide back toward his car, he comes onto her, thinking she is a real woman.  When he reaches under her dress and learns the truth, Vida tries to break free ... and knocks the sheriff to the ground, where he conks his head.  They drive off quickly, before he can come to and REALLY do them all some damage.
Soon after, their old Cadillac breaks down, and Chi Chi hitchhikes them all a ride into Snydersville, a town that makes Mayberry look like New York City.  Tiny and hick and populated with small-town minds as well, Snydersville seems to be the LAST place three drag queens would want to get stranded (if they want to live, that is), but when these three are stalled there for the weekend, until they get their car repaired, they decide to make the best of it by making over the town's women, addding some spark to a Strawberry Social - and, in general, bringing tons of color to an otherwise drab existence.  But little do they know that Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn) - who is less than thrilled by being knocked unconscious by a ""boy in a dress,"" is out to find them ...
The movie is uneven in spots - the scenes in the town go from hysterical to being too stage - but overall whenever Snipes or Swayze or Leguizamo are on-screen, you could never be bored.  Funny and with some VERY sharp one-liners, the movie comes close (especially in the end) to turning sappy with its ""why can't we all just get along"" mind-set -- but never quite pushes that envelope.  The three leads are EXCELLENT, and backed beautifully by a great supporting cast the includes Stockard Channig, Melinda Dillon, Chris Penn, Jason London - even ""Alias"" star Michael Vartan.  Ru Paul and Robin Williams add both class and style to brief cameos ... as does the one and only Miss Julie Newmar herself.

Julie Newmar"".  Like the Australian film, which featured a trio of drag queens traveling across the rugged Australian outback from Sydney to the isolated resort of Alice Springs in a pink bus, the American version featured its own drag queen trio traveling from NYC to Los Angeles in an aging yellow Cadillac convertible; but the similarities end there. The drag queen trio featured in the American version was Miss Noxeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes), Miss Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) and Miss Chi-Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo).  After Noxeema and Vida share the title of a drag queen contest, they invite (with Noxeema's reluctance) Chi-Chi to join them to participate in a national contest in Los Angeles.  Not having enough money for all three to fly to Los Angeles from NYC, Vida convinces them to instead use their winnings to purchase a car that all three could travel in.  The film's title comes from an autographed picture of Julie Newmar that Vida steals from a restaurant and places in the used yellow Cadillac convertible that the trio purchases.  Similar to the Australian version, the car breaks down along the way, forcing the trio to stay a few days in a small, languishing town.  There, they meet the town's assorted residents that include hotel owner Carol Ann (Stockard Channing), her abusive husband Virgil (Arliss Howard), Beatrice (Blythe Danner), the polite Bobby Ray (Jason London), Merna (Melinda Dillon), Loretta (Beth Grant), the aging Clara (Alice Drummond) and restaurant owner Jimmy Joe (Mike Hodge) to name a few. They also meet law enforcement officer Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn) who wants to arrest them.
Though arguably not as well made as ""The Adventures Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"", ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar"" is still a very entertaining and engaging film that is sufficiently different from the former to not be redundant.  Cameo appearances in the film include Julie Newmar, Robin Williams (as John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt), RuPaul (as Miss Rachel Tensions) and Naomi Campbell.  Memorable scenes in the film include the restaurant, the used car lot, Vida seeing her mother (Margaret H. Flynn), Chi-Chi earning rites of passage, Sheriff Dollard, Noxeema's interactions with townsfolk, the clothing store, the beauty parlor and the closing scenes.  Patrick Swawye received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical, and John Leguizamo received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor in the Comedy/Musical.  Sadly, Wesley Snipes did not receive a nomination for his excellent performance.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.

47297,4,0783217048,"Some may say it's a 'Priscilla - Queen of the Desert' rip off, and indeed 'To Wong Foo...' shares a very similar story line to Priscilla (drag queens embark on a road trip) and whilst it lacks much of the wit and charm of Priscilla, there is no denying that 'To Wong Foo...' has its own very special charm and sparkle.
Revolving around three drag queens (played by Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo), who set off on a road trip to Hollywood California. Mishaps happen along the way and they become stuck in a small country town.
It seems that all is well with the country folk unsuspecting of their true identity. Not is all well though and the three drag queens turn the country town on its heels so everybody benefits. So you could call 'To Wong Foo...' a fable of sorts. It's unlikely that such a town would be so accepting of three outrageous drag queens, but if you suspend your belief in the realities of the harsh world for a moment this movie will give you a very special message.
Wonderful performances from the three leads, with Wesley Snipes being an eye opener as a flamboyant drag queen. We are so used to seeing him in masculine action movies and it's wonderful to see him flex another side of his acting muscle. For me though the standout is John Leguizamo. When adorned in full dress and make up he actually makes a convincing female. We have seem him portray a variety of roles over the years and 'To Wong Foo...' is another string to his bow. Shame he is so underrated in the movie world.
The picture quality on this DVD is clear and crisp and hard to fault. The vibrant colouring really brings out the bold strong hues of the costumes. Sadly the only special feature is a series of several deleted scenes. Interesting to watch, but I would liked to have seen more effort made with the special features.
It may not have the charm, wit or personality of Priscilla, but be rest assured that this movie is a wonderful fable of how acceptance and tolerance is a better way of life than hate and inequality.",1058572800,6,2035,4.458445040214477

Patrick Swayzee is the demure Vida, an unsinkable optimist with a caring heart who is like the mother to this trio.

47303,4,0783217048,"The movie itself is still great (but not a great as The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert) but the DVD version is disappointing.
When I found out that it was going to contain deleted scenes, I was hoping that they would have been included in the movie. Instead they group them together as an extra. Granted after watching those scenes, it was understandable why they were deleted and/or changed. The only scene I would have added is when the ""girls"" are driving up the mountain and the car stalls and a truck was barreling down on them.
I have always enjoyed this movie. Wesley Snipes is hysterical as Noxeema Jackson (Jessie's daughter). His one liners and acid like tongue were perfect. Patrick Swayze was very matronly as Vida Boheme. The too tall drag queen that still has her driver's license with the name of Eugene on it. John Leguizamo was the most brilliant of everyone. He was so outrageous and razor edged funny (not to mention you had to think if it was really a woman playing Chi-Chi). He was the struggling would be drag queen who describes herself as the ""Latino Marilyn Munroe-I got more legs than a bucket of chicken.""

47305,5,0783217048,"I was hesitant to see this film, because I thought it would be an Americanized version of ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,"" which was a wonderful film in itself. But ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar"" was so much more! It was a delightful piece of heaven with three charming angels! :) Initially, I really didn't think such macho men like Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes could pull off playing refined ladies of drag, but they were FABULOUS! And John Leguizamo was great - as anticipated - such an incredibly talented actor! And the story, was charming. Such heart!

While most of the film was fun-loving and light-hearted, I was moved by some of the ""heavier"" issues as well: Rich boy Swayze is rejected by his family because of his drag life; Swayze is almost molested by a bad cop, who thinks to take advantage of a ""lady"" on the road; Snipes' character inadvertantly reaches out to a withdrawn woman, a small town turns a blind eye to a battered woman, but Swayze's ""queen"" cannot; and all three queens help the women of a small town to empower themselves and play in a world of glamor and beauty. It was very empowering to watch these men dressed as women make such a wonderful statement for so many communities (whether they intended to do so or not). As someone else posted here, it's mainly about acceptance and love and the power those things can have in one's life.

47306,5,0783217048,"I vividly remember the advance publicity surrounding this movie and thinking ""Gee, these guys must really be comfortable in their own space not to even worry about any repercussions!."" I love this movie more so because it was during this advance publicity that my own drag queen brother died; he was so thoroughly looking forward to seeing this movie. So from that standpoint, each and every time I see it, it is quite uplifiting for it reminds me of him. Even more so, neither Wesley, Patrick, or John made a mockery of drag queens but revelled in playing them to the hilt. Of course, the highlight was RuPaul, as last year's drag queen beauty winner, emerging at the contest in a confederate gown! I could imagine the South just having a hissy fit at that! But the movie celebrates differences and is warm. Those who claim it had a weak plot and it wasn't this and it wasn't that simply need to get a grip. This is a classic example of being unable to see the forest for the trees. Of course there are movies with stronger plots, better direction, more intense performances BUT WHO CARES????!... If you want a nice uplifting movie that teaches a lesson that we, in 2003, STILL HAVE NOT LEARNED, then the lesson itself can NEVER be trite. When you forget our differences and concentrate on our similarities, you'd be surprised at the progress we make! This is a really cute movie with wonderful performances which lift the spirit and really does make one think. If you are looking for a literary masterpiece, go get one - this ain't it - it's better - it is simply fun, something too many lose sight of in their quest to appear pseudo-intellectual!

47308,4,0783217048,"The premise of ""Too Wong Foo"" is very simple: three drag queens, the soft-hearted Vida (Patrick Swayze), the no-nonsense Noxeema (Wesley Snipes), and the dreamy, romantic Chi-Chi (John Leguizamo), travel across the country in a vintage Cadillac which breaks down in the tiny, idyllic rural town of Snydersville. Beneath its classic American small town facade, however, Snydersville is a place rent by domestic violence, alcoholism, racism, depression, and thuggery. Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi encourage the town's women to take control of their own lives, not through any particular magic, but by simply reaching out with compassion to their fellow human beings--Vida to the abused Carol Ann (Stockard Channing), Noxeema to the depressed, mute Clara, and Chi-Chi to the young Bobby Lee. The themes of the movie--that only women who have found their inner strength (and men who are in touch with their feminine side) can change society for the better and that ultimately beauty is not a luxury, but a necessity that can get you through the dark hours--give this film a surprisingly feminist outlook.  All three actors--men best known for their macho roles--give strong performances and although John Leguizamo makes the most convincing woman, both Wesley Snipes and Patrick Swayze are very believable. I became so accustomed to thinking of them as women that it was a shock to me when Vida's wig accidentally came off and she was revealed as a man. ""To Wong Foo"" has been repeatedly compared with ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"", but the two movies could not be more dissimilar. ""Priscilla"" is grittier, deliberately not glamorous and less thematically tied together. Although I liked the film overall, I was displeased by its demeaning portrayal of women throughout the movie. I do recommend both movies, but don't expect them to be mirror images of each other. ""To Wong Foo"" is the one most suited for a family audience. ""Priscilla"" has a great deal of profanity, sexual innuendo, and a very casual attitude to drunkness and drugs.",1039478400,7,2033,5.141993957703927

47372,3,0783217048,"[Add a half-star if you don't mind being manipulated.]
All during the summer, in seeing previews, I was worried about To Wong Foo... being an American version or rip-off of Priscilla: Queen Of The Desert. Trust me, there are a lot of similarities; however To Wong Foo... stands on its own as an enjoyable movie experience. In the audience I sat in, there was laughter and applause throughout and I found myself laughing and applauding along. (I hadn't expected to.)
Patrick Swayze is Vida Boheme, a drag queen from Bala Cynwyd, PA living in New York City. Bala Cynwyd is pivotal in his story. So is Noxeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes). Boheme and Jackson are friends competing against Chi Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo) and others for ""Drag Queen of the Year"". Well, as luck would have it, Boheme and Jackson tie for the honors and both win an all-expense paid trip to Hollywood.
Well, Boheme is a queen with a heart. She can't stand to see Chi Chi, who lives in the same building, so upset about not winning the crown; so, Vida bullies Noxeema into trading their paid-for airline tickets for a car and, together, the three set off to drive cross-country. Shades of Boys On The Side.
Early on, the trio is stopped in the middle of nowhere by a county sheriff (Chris Penn in a hoot of a role). What happens next brings more remembrances of Boys On The Side.
Eventually, our fun-loving ""females"" end up in Snydersville, a small hamlet where everyone seems to have a problem and our girls have a solution for every single one of them. Despite this manipulation, To Wong Foo... delights at every turn. It's laugh-out-loud funny and not at all subtle. Normally, that would be a criticism, but in this case, it turns out to be a refreshing change of pace.
Of course, all of the elements in the story come together for a schmaltzy conclusion. But, that's OK. You'll get all wrapped up in it anyway, just like I did.
