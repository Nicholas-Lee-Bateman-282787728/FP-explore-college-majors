There are just too many studies and you have to do more than read them...you have to understand them and determine whether they are scientifically valid. This takes a lot of time. He's always producing YouTube videos, lectures, books etc. When does he do all of this reading and evaluation? Next, are the studies in English the only ones contributing to our scientific knowledge? Is the non-English-speaking world dumb or what? Finally, I think what he does is look for study headlines that are sensational enough for him to use to get attention for himself. He's just another vegetarian pushing plants. And we've all gotten very fat on the plant diet.",1528588800,,792,4.788321167883212
