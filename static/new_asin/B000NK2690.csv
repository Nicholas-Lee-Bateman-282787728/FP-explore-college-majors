8178982,3,B000NK2690,"Another reviewer mentioned that the original print was longer than this Grapevine Video package. I'm new to Lubitsch, and have yet to compare the story with the history - which did seem extremely abrupt to me at the end.  The romantic story that is the main thread works well enough, and I generally felt that the screenplay was decent.  As with many early films, the camera tends to be static in scenes. Negri - whom I saw earlier in ""Die Bergkatze"" on YouTube - is charming and plays her part well.

This is a rather basic copy, with plenty of video noise and some skips. When it arrived, the DVD was rattling around in the plastic box and appeared to have a small scratch, but that wasn't noticeable when I viewed it.  The film is worth reconstructing, and the music could be improved: e.g. both this and Die Bergkatze used variations on the Pomp and Circumstance overture in a few places, and the organ in Mme DuBarry/Passion often felt too heavy and intrusive to me.",1389139200,2,971,4.531428571428571
8178983,2,B000NK2690,"This print actually clocks at 109 minutes, not 99. Unfortunately, maybe 15 seconds are missing at the end; perhaps they showed the beheading and might have offended the American audience.

Ernst Lubitsch could impart only journeyman direction to this German costume epic, for his natural proclivity was toward lighter fare as proven out in his subsequent successes in America. In Passion, scene after scene emerges rather flat, the performances not much particularized.

Darling Jeanne (Pola Negri) from a Parisian millinery shop has a student boyfriend, Armand (Harry Lieptke). But she catches the eye of an aristocrat, then marries Count DuBarry to facilitate the move to Versailles as the mistress of Louis XV (Emil Jannings). Thanks to her charms, she manages to save Armand from execution and to get him raised to officer in the King's guards. Then Louis XV dies of smallpox.

At this point, the scenario writers say to hell with history as they ruthlessly compress events. Madam DuBarry is exiled to a country estate beyond Paris. The Paris populace is raging toward revolution, with Armand's help. They assault the Bastille, arrest Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, as well as Madame DuBarry, whom the Tribunal condemns to death with Armand's assent. In a change of heart, Armand tries to help his former sweetheart escape but is shot in the head. DuBarry is trundled off to the public guillotine and as she, standing, is strapped to the vertical board the film, before the hinged board can be lowered into beheading position, jumps to a still of a wall sconce. The End.

The added soundtrack of organ music meshes OK with the scenes but doesn't much punch up our involvement. Details in this print--in costumes, wigs, sets--have faded with time. Strikingly, the producer, Projektion-AG Union, continued its prolific film output both during WWI and thereafter.",1270425600,9,1865,5.125
