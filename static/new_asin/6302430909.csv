466553,2,6302430909,"Since I loved the first Gate movie, as bad as this had looked when reading the liner notes in the back cover, I had to at least say that I saw it especially considering Louis Tripp returned from the prior Gate film (the only returning character if you don't count the house).

Basically a teenage Terry has become engrossed with his experience as a young kid when the Gate opened and Hell broke loose. Now, he has read much on how to resummon the demons and I won't ruin it for you, but he catches a demon that has the ability to grant wishes. The twist is that due to their evil source, the wishes take on an evil-like ability of their own. As the story developes, others make wishes besides Terry and somehow from all the bad that it has caused, Terry and his companion (I can't remember her name) help save the world again.

Pros:
It was interesting to see the Gate through the other side.
Funny in parts.
Opening credits identical to the first Gate except purple and the music is similar. You almost think it will be as good as the first.

Cons:
Not really scary.
Ending kind of sucked as somehow the dead rises with no real explanation.
Some holes in the plot on how the wishes worked. I did not see the king of the world.",1104364800,6,1227,4.280172413793103

466693,5,6302430909,"I spent a lot of $$$ for the DVD because I am a collector of Horror movies, and have lot's of passion for it! The DVD is full screen (Black Bars)  on the left & right side of the film, and the picture is also grainy looking but fairly good still! Upon hearing there is a Blu-ray release of the film I immediately pre-ordered this being that I am re-collecting movies from the 80's & 90's on Blu-ray to get the best picture and sound quality as I can get!

Gate 2 is a good movie in it's own for Horror buffs and will be sure to deliver the satisfaction desired!",1512432000,4,561,4.045045045045045

466699,4,6302430909,kind of a strange sequel but is worth the buy.  I love these 80s or early 90s sequel movies.  even if its cheesey does not mean its bad,1366848000,2,135,3.7857142857142856

466785,5,6302430909,"The story line was different and because I have the first one decided to complete my collection, Little monsters causing havoc and killing a house seems like a good idea, Now that we didn't get to much off. The cast played their roles fantastic and I felt like I was involved in the show with them. You never know what's next and what the nasty little things can do, A bit of comedy to lighten up the horror, Yes I think this movie is really great and I have given an A for the thought and ideas in this movie, be prepared and wait for the suspense as there is plenty to go around, worth buying and different to all shows I have seen since. Want more well I don't like spoiling movies for everyone and I rather let you decide for yourself. Buy your goodies sit back grab a pillow and enjoy a groovy classic.

466786,2,6302430909,This was a good quality DVD but not the best movie. It would have been better with Stephen Dorf. Stick to watching Gate the original.,1317513600,,133,4.36
466787,3,6302430909,"Terry becomes obsessed with The Gate after narrowly escaping from the demons five years ago. He summons the creatures once more, and manages to trap one of the minions which has the ability to grant wishes for its captor. Naturally, the wishes have ironic consequences, and each wish comes at a terrible cost. While the special FX do not fall anywhere near the same incredible level as the original, THE GATE 2 does offer much of the same stop-motion animation and forced perspective sequences that never fail to impress. Where the film does begin to show an immediate decline is in the sluggish pace and annoying characters (including the once enjoyable Terry). The recycled take on The Monkey's Paw fails to deliver anything new or interesting to the original story, and tries to substitute plot and character for a few gooey FX sequences. The climax of the film finds Terry and his new love interest crossing through The Gate in to the hellish alternate dimension in a final confrontation with one of the demon lords, but the scene is short lived and only delivers the most unconvincing special FX and costuming of the entire feature. After stripping away the childhood fantasy, terrifying mood, and likable characters in THE GATE, THE GATE 2 becomes just another watered down sequel that lacks most of the successful elements of the original.

466788,2,6302430909,"Not quite what we expected--however, it is playable.  Tape has been subjected to magnetic field(s) at some time.  Unusual amount of shelf dust which permeated the cassette itself, requiring inordinate time to recover.

For the price and the availability, it was worth the price.  We will lower our expectations next time for items of this genre and category.",1244419200,,358,5.120689655172414
466789,3,6302430909,"Remember The Gate?  A very fun and entertaining little horror flick that never achieved much popularity and was pretty much destined to show on HBO now and again back in the day.  Stephen Dorff's film debut by the way.  Director Tibor Tak&aacute;cs(who also made the underrated I, Madman) decided to bless us with another tale of The Gate, but unfortunately the (black)magic really isn't all there this time.
Terry(the secondary hero from the first film) is obsessing over what he had experienced in his neighbor's house two years earlier.  With his father on a downward slide of depression and alcoholism, he decides to conjure up the very same powers that nearly killed him and ask for help for his father, who needs to get a job and kick the sauce.  Along with two thugs and a new love interest, he performs the ritual in Stephen Dorff's abandoned house(Dorff's character had the smarts to move away after the incident.  Or maybe they just couldn't talk him into doing a sequel).  The ritual is botched due to one of the idiot thugs, and one of the ""minions""(those lovable little mini-demons we saw in the first film) ends up with a bullet in it.  Terry nurses the creature back to life and soon everybody involved in the ritual is getting everything they wished for!  But the problem in films like these is that getting your wish isn't always a good thing.  The wishes literally turn to poopy after so much time.  Terry sees the error of his ways(he managed to reopen that damned gate through his meddling) and with his newfound girl, goes to do battle with the forces of darkness to close the gate once more.
Could have been fun, but ends up being merely so-so.  Maybe I was spoiled by pleasant childhood memories of the first film, but there was nothing all that exciting or interesting here.  The first movie had a small army of the evil ""minions"", which was one of the best aspects of the movie.  Here we only get one.  Yes, only one.  Other than the four characters getting their wishes and having them ""poop"" out on them(one funny moment has one of the thugs leaving a tip for a waiter at a restaurant and the money slaps onto the bill as poop.  He's seen a minute later trying to wipe it off with a napkin and smearing it all over the bill.), not alot seems to happen until the final act of the film where we're treated to a bit of stop motion and rubber suit demons.  Too little, too late.
All in all, it's rather harmless, but it'll just make you want to watch the original again.",1222819200,9,2493,4.490022172949002
466790,2,6302430909,"Sadly, despite some decent creature effects ranging from an actor in a demon costume to old school stop-motion animation, Gate II offers very little to the viewer with it's sub-standard storyline and dull characters. One never really feels that the four teens are in that great a danger...and the low budget seems to have had a greater affect on the production this time around. A surprisingly disappointing sequel (considering that the 1987 original was so well done) that is recommended for the unwavering, die-hard Gate fan only. Gate II was filmed in 1989 but sat on the shelf for three years until the resolution of distribution problems earned it a limited (yet ultimately unsuccessful) theatrical release in 1992.

466793,4,6302430909,"Gate 2 is a better written and directed film than its predesessor simply because the character of terry is much more interesting than glen. The first one,which I love,was obviously made to cash in on the whole gremlins/critters craze,while gate 2 has a more focused storyline,and while the gate features great stop motion effects,gate 2`s equally great but sparse usage of them actually helps the film stand on its own as darker and more real life than the first one. All the actors,including louis tripp,who gives a quitely commanding perfomance,give the movie a realistic edge that the first gate couldn't graspe with its goofy scare tactics. All in all,a highly underrated horror film thats worthy of some respect",1119139200,4,716,5.076271186440678
