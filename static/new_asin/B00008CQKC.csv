For those of you who are actors trying to find another great product to add to the library or learn more about the business of acting...I have a few pieces of advice before divulging my review on the product.

Try to find used products...the sellers are very nice and personable and great to hear from in regards to the products I buy. It will bring up a point in a minute

Now...about Mr. Fenton's workshop.

I found a majority of the Business aspect to be quite accurate to what is happening today...although what I believed needs to be expressed is that this is a guy who is very much in touch with the tough nitty gritty bolts of the business...needs to update his philosophies about the new technology and business on line...had no clue to any of the small indie circuits...had no knowledge of how to really go after the smaller markets saying that the studios are easier to get into than independent films...that is downright absurd.

I feel indies are easier for starting actors. especially for people trying to obtain SAG status or any status for that matter.

Also, the price at certain places for the product was down right outrageous. Another $70 at a local store...if you can...try to find the used product of the workshop here. I was glad I paid 50% less than the asking price.

on a side note...Danielle Panabaker makes a cameo appearance before she got big in the studios. Thought that was awesome.

Hope this somewhat helps...Thanks and good luck shoppers.",1285891200,,1493,4.697318007662835

Most of the time Mike keeps referring to casting accomplishments he had 25 years ago as if it makes him an expert.  He even admits that when he was casting there was nobody else in the business and he had no competition.

The brutal reality is that the entertainment business changes at the speed of light.  Mike's ideas and philosophies are antiquated and trite.  To be perfectly fair, let us take a look at his more modern track record.  In the last 20 years he has not had a major or important project and casts obscure projects.  In short, I don't recommend this at all.",1285286400,,803,4.475862068965517
