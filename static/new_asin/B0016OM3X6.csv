3161952,5,B0016OM3X6,Best Friends is an amazing place and the DVD is great.  I hope it helps bring to light this wonderful sanctuary. You can buy this DVD (for only a couple bucks more plus postage) on the Best Friends.org  website and proceeds will benifit this great sanctuary.,1219881600,8,258,4.586956521739131
3161953,5,B0016OM3X6,"I really enjoyed seeing Best Friends for the first time; I've been a member for years. I could finally see people and places I've only read about. I couldn't have enjoyed the 3 included episodes more, and I'm about to order more of the Dogtown sets. I'd love to see a DVD about the cat side too, in case anybody with any clout to produce one is reading!!

BTW, there don't appear to be any subtitles on this title, so you'll want to keep that in mind if they're important to you. I can't vouch for presence or absence of closed captions because I don't have a chip.",1309305600,,565,4.231481481481482
3161954,5,B0016OM3X6,"To be at Best Friends helping these animals is something I may never experince in my life. But to watch these men & woman do the work their are so right for helps me at least see there are people who care about animals as much as I do.  To see the Dogs as they enter and happily leave Dog Town is a privilege that the film crew from National Geographic has been able to bring us to our homes.  This show is amazing but more amazing is the people who work with these dogs, weather it's a medical issue or a training issue the dogs have a second chance to be with a family.",1288396800,,571,3.9565217391304346
3161955,5,B0016OM3X6,"I checked out the New Beginnings and Second Chances from the local library where I live and when I was watching it I was in tears because it breaks my heart that all these animals were just tossed away like yesterdays garbage. I am a dog lover as well as a cat lover and all 4 of my dogs came from the shelter and I am very please with them. DogTown does an amazing job at training this dogs to be social and how to interact with other dogs and the dogtown staff showes all the dogs that they help that they are loved and all these animals ever wanted was a good home where they could be spoiled. My Alaskan Malamute was returned to the shelter that he was placed in for the second time and the lady at the shelter said that if he came back that they would have to put him down because he had been returned twice and I can say that I've had him for almost 7 years and he is so spoiled and just knowing that I saved him from that he has been the best friend I could ask for because when I'm upset he comes over and lays right by me amd gives me kisses as a way of saying it's ok. My Siberian Husky, and Border Collie were abandoned by their previous owners and when I adopted them they were a little afraid but once they found out that it was going to be ok they just kinda relaxed, and my last dog that I adopted was a Great Pyrenness and the owner of her dropped her off at a HIGH KILL SHELTER along with her 2 siblings I adopted her from a foster mom that had her for 2 months and when I got her the foster mom was sad because she had grown attached to her I sent the foster mom pictures of her and she was very happy that we could give her a good home. I was really sad when Dr. Dix had to put Bruno down because I know what it's like to have to put a dog down. I had 2 pitbull puppies that had the PARVO VIRUS and I was in tears when I had to do that but I knew in my heart that was the right thing to do because the vet said even with treatment it wouldn't prolong their lives. All I can say is DOGTOWN is very good at what they do. I enjoy watching the show when it comes on and I would recommend that if anybody wants to adopt a dog go to your local animal shelter there are good dogs there that are waiting for a chance to be adopted and have a good life.",1268092800,2,2263,3.8272921108742004
3161956,5,B0016OM3X6,"Wow.  This series came to my attention when I recently got ahold of the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DogTown-Tales-of-Rescue-Rehabilitation-and-Redemption/dp/1426205627/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DogTown: Tales of Rescue, Rehabilitation, and Redemption</a>&nbsp;that is due out in October.  Not having the National Geographic Channel, I bought this dvd.  I can't remember the last time I was so moved.  I think I cried three times.  I bawled my eyes out over Bruno dying.  I cried when a trainer had to part with the adorable Wiggles.  I shed a few tears over the terrified terrier, Animal.  I had to gather my own dogs onto my lap to comfort me!

This dvd is three episodes.  The first is about a chow named Bruno that is really old and having some nerological problems.  There is also a dog that had bitten an infant and rather than allow it to be put to sleep, Dog Town attempts to train it around kids and such so that it may be adopted.  The second episode covers a group of dogs that were discovered abused and neglected in a breeding farm.  I did not realize this, but apparently breeding farms that sell to pet stores often keep dogs confined in a 2 by 2 cage and except for breeding once or twice a month, they obtain no physical contact with other dogs or humans whatsover.  That is where the terrier comes in.  The third episode warms hearts by introducing viewers to Wiggles, a bulldog with a drunken walk and a bowel problem.

I learned a lot from these shows.  The next time I add to my family, I will getting my new family member from the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary.

Something that did bother me, however... I can't help but wonder how the Navajo Reservation is allowed to have numerous dogs and permit them to run around with mange and worms, but in the suburbs of Utah, we can only have two dogs no matter how pampered, spoiled, and well cared for they are.  I was wondering this throughout all of espiode one.  I certainly would not mind adopting one of these dogs in need.

Thumbs up to the people of DogTown.",1253232000,12,2084,4.814084507042254

The dogs from dog town have been through more
than some of us have been through.
Watching the recoveries from what would
have been the end of life without some
necessary changes, reminds me of us.

I can't honestly tell the difference between
what these dogs have been through and
us.  Some are dangerous when they
are in a place where they can feel their
