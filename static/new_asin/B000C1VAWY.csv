2451505,5,B000C1VAWY,"I didn't know what to suspect when I heard there would be an ""American Version""

of one of my fav. anime shows. I'm proud to say, that this is a great transition from the japanese language, to english. The voice acting is especially good, notably by ""Hikaru"" and ""Minmay"" (voice acted by Mari Iijima, who was also did the Japanese version!). She really caught my eye, because she still sounds sweet and young like the old show.  I found it fascinating that these voice acters kept the show as thrilling as it used to be! It was perfect! You must buy this if you are a fan!",1137196800,2,572,4.336448598130841
2451506,2,B000C1VAWY,"I've just watched 3 of the six episodes, of the newly dubbed version of the Macross (which for some reason in this version, everyone seems to refer to the ship as, ""Mecross"") and I have to say that I was VERY disappointed with the choice of voices that where used.

Firstly, okay, I see the significant of having the original Japanese voice actor of Minmey, reprising her role for the English dub, but here's the problem, instead of the young, teenage voice that she should possess (seeing as she is only 15 when the show starts, then is 16 for a good chunk of the show) we now have the voice of a 20 something, coming out of her mouth, which just doesn't work at all.

Then there's Misa (Lisa, for the Robotech fans) who is suppose to be an older character, but who's voice makes her seem like she's a teenager.

It's funny to listen to the commentary with the guy involved in the casting of the voice actors, explaining how he thought all of the voices fit, as he thought the voice actor for Misa sounded very mature (he apparently needs a hearing aid) and then he goes on to hint at the fact that the original voice choices for the Macross portion of, Robotech, weren't that good.

Well, they may not have been perfect, but at lease they did a better job of capturing the ages of each character.

As for the new translation, at least where the English dub is concerned, once again, I wasn't all that impressed, as I find that the original Robotech translations (although changed slightly in certain places to accommodate  the need to connect the other two series to it) was a much better dub, and even the Animego subs where nicer.

Another annoyance is the fact that the Japanese track is only 2.0 mix, and a very tinny, crappy one at that, so there's no hope in getting rid of the Animego set.

Also, it sounds like that crappy new sound effect mix (used for the Robotech Remastered set, has been carried over to this new set, which means that the gatling guns sound like machine guns, instead of the distinctively sounding weapons from the original Japanese series.

Even the extras aren't that spectacular, as there's only two commentaries, a short 8 plus minute, talk with the English translator, a short chat with the Japanese voice actor of Minmey (which we get to hear all over again during her commentary), and some notes (which look like some of the same ones found in the Animego version).

All in all, not really worth the effort of a purchase.

***Also of note: The Zentradi have lost their distinctive, vocal reverb echo effect, in the new English dub (which was present in both the Japanese and Robotech versions, as well as the Japanese movie version, Macross: Do You Remember Love) which makes no sense, and seems to me, to be due to laziness on the part of the people at ADV (I mean hey, they chose to replace the Veritech fighter's gun sound, from a cool sounding electronic gatling gun sound, to that of a standard machine gun sound, for their new 5.1 stereo surround mix in both the Robotech Remastered and now the Macross DVD's, so why would they put in the extra effort to give the Zentradi their distinctive reverb echo effect (which in all reality would be a heck of a lot easier to do today, with all of the computerized sound equipment available, then it was back in the early 80's, but they managed to accomplish it).

I honestly suspect that the people behind this new English dub, where stanch haters of the original Robotech dub, so much, that they chose to purposely do the opposite of every thing that was done, sound wise, in Robotech, regardless of if it worked for the new sound dub or not (I mean, the voice director does state in the extras, that he thought that the original voice actors for Robotech, pretty much sucked, in his opinion).",1136851200,14,3780,4.510233918128655
2451507,5,B000C1VAWY,"This is the greatest anime series of all time!!!
The original 36 episodes of the 1982 series:
Super Dimension Fortress Macross.
I like Neon Genesis Evangelion,and highly recommend that series as well.but it takes a back seat to this.
Any and all Anime fans absolutely must have this series!!!
it's going to be re-released by ADV. (get it!!!!)
The Animego release is no longer available.
This is to anime as the original star wars is to sci-fi.
Unfortunately,the later series of macross were quite lame.
Macross plus looks great,but the story is weak.
Macross seven and dynamite seven is horrible and quite childish even.the animation is better,but the story is stupid.and the characters are annoying.
after the original 36 episodes of Macross,everything else is just fluff!
Even the recently released Macross Zero.it looks fantastic!!but the story is very disapointing. I thought it was a prequel to the original series,but it strayed away from it from the beginning,and became a magic and special powers kinda anime.(typical).was waiting for a role playing card game to happen during this one! LOL
they bombed on zero!!
stick with the original MASTERPIECE!!
5 stars,absolute perfection.
Fantastic story,almost seems like it could actually be a probable reality. And not an impossible unrealistic story.

the original Macross series and yes...Neon Genesis Evangelion,are the two greatest anime series of all time. And must be had by followers of anime.

Weta workshop (creators of the lord of the rings trilogy) is currently in pre-production mode on a live action movie for Neon Genesis Evangelion!!!)

2451508,5,B000C1VAWY,"Originally AnimEigo had Macross, and in December 2004, their sublicense (from Harmony Gold) to it expired.  So then Harmony Gold sublicensed it to ADV earlier this summer.  The reason why AnimEigo's release didn't have a dub is because Harmony Gold didn't want it to compete with the dub on Robotech (as why Southern Cross and Mospedea still don't have a dub).  This release by ADV will include a dub, more accurate subtitles (including removing the Star Trekisms that AnimEigo put in), whatever extras ADV will include and will be on 7 volumes.  Also, the original voice actor for Minmay will be the english voice actor for Minmay.  Vol. 1 will have 6 episodes, the other 6 will have 5 episodes each.  In comparison, AnimEigo's release had 4 episodes per DVD spead across 9 DVDs",1132704000,,779,4.776119402985074
2451509,5,B000C1VAWY,"It's great you actually can edit your reviews.  I wrote the first review before the DVD was released.  I've seen this series growing up as a child.  So the Japanese series to me was always the true story.  Robotech was great for it's time, but really dumbified Lynn Minmay's character.  So I bought the first installment of Macross.  I too was dissappointed in the attempted to call Macross ""Mecross"".  In Japanese, although spelled Makurosu, still translates over to Macross, not ""mecross"".  However, Mari Iijima's voice acting really brings back the character of Minmay that Mari did in Macross DYRL?  The elegance and grace of the character is brought back.  I love the scene where Lynn Minmay fears that she would die without marriage, and how this was vital to the beginning of the relationship between Minmay & Hikaru.  Mari Iijima's commentary and interview on this DVD made this DVD probably the most sought after.  Everyone loved Mari in Japan for her role.  But here in the States, Mari hasn't been associated with Minmay in the same way yet.  Mari's expressed feelings towards the counterpart voice actor of Hikaru (Japanese) really brings meaning to each episode.  As Hikaru's voice actor is now deceased.  Macross will live on as the greatest Anime here in the United States.  Oddly surpassing Japan's greatest Anime ""Gundam Z"" as the most popular sci-fi drama.  Even my wife was impressed by this 20 year old series.",1132617600,4,1430,4.912133891213389
2451510,5,B000C1VAWY,"The main storyline of Macross  takes place in 2009.  Ten years of furious conflict and frenzied construction have turned an alient wreck into a human triumph, the colossal space battleship Macross.

  On the day of the ship's launch, the world waits for mankinds next giant leap.  Unfortunely, unbeknownst to them is that a merciless warrior race known as the Zentradi known for the destruction and conquest of planets have Earth in its sights.

  When long-dormant systems aboard the Macross suddenly fires upon the alien fleet, the ship meant to preserve humanity may become its undoing.  This leads to the war between the Earthlings versus the Zentradi.

  As I watched a preview DVD, I was amazed of how good the anime looks despite being over 20 years old.  And for audio, I was very impressed by the 5.1 mix and also the English dubbing.  Very well done!

  Of course, for fans of the original Japanese dialogue with English subtitles, they are also available.

  I know that there are many fans who have purchased the many available forms of Robotech on VHS or DVD and possibly the previous Macross DVD Box sets but with digitally restored video, uncut and now with a very well done English dub ala 5.1, it's definitely worth picking up.  Also, for the fact that Mari Iijima, the original Minmay doing the Engllish dub is just amazing in itself.  In my book this version of Macross is a must buy!",1220400000,,1403,4.706611570247934
2451511,3,B000C1VAWY,"I was one of those prejudiced by watching Robotech first.  In my defense though I was into Macross even before Robotech came out.  As a child, the times I saw the macross robots in books and comic specialty shops, I wished the show would come to America.
So how was it?  The English dub leaves much to be desired.  The acting & words are bad.  They don't follow the actual translation all the time when you read the subtitles.
If you watch the DVD with the original Japanese with the subtitles, its better than watching the English dub, which makes the show seem like its a little kiddie show.
Robotech may have also tarnished my opinion because the music for Robotech is vastly superior to the original Macross music.  Maybe its a cultural thing.  I thought the Minmei songs in Robotech weren't bad, but the Macross songs are full of that type of anime ""Hello Kitty"" fluff that its more like its appealing to little girls than to the typical male anime fan.
I do reccomend that purists & hardcore anime enthusiasts check this out because its one of the backbones of classic anime, but I wouldn't buy it.",1202601600,,1104,4.517587939698492
2451512,4,B000C1VAWY,"Yay, a fantastic reproduction of the show I love.  It helps that the voice actor who does Ed on Full Metal Alchemist also does Hikaru.  Minmei is a bit annoying at times, but definitely not to the point that I would not watch any more.

Very enjoyable...who doesn't like giant transforming planes/robots, giant aliens, and drama?",1187827200,,329,4.839285714285714
2451513,4,B000C1VAWY,"I love the image restoration and the remastered verson of the soundtrack in 5.1 dolby is excellent,but the dubbing on some parts is borderline ridiculous! Fokker is pronounced 'Fawker' and is almost like a running joke for the first few episodes. He is also somewhat of a douchebag in this series compared to the cool older brother in the original dubbing..he's just a little over the top,plus Gloval is a friggin' nutcase..he's just soo incongruent most of the time with the action and always a notch above the what's really going onscreen. I rather enjoyed the original Gloval though he usualy had some silly one liner he'd spurt out out of nowhere making him look kinda clueless. For instance,the control panel would get a message like' captain it seems as if the Zentradi are setting us up for a trap!' Glovals reaction would be like..'I see' then it'll freeze on his face for a few seconds before he says something else totaly disconnected lol happend alot on the original series,maybe I am just the only one to notice. The new ADV Macross looks and sounds better in terms of quality but the overall feel of it is nothing like Robotech,with the added sound effects and restored original soundtrack of the japanese version it seems a little more theatrical and dramatic..especialy with the over-reacting and melodramaticness of some of the scenes. Though I am only on the 2nd disc, I am interested to see how the storyline differs compared to the Robotech:Macross saga and how thy deal with the translations. Overall it's a different experiance then watching Robotech being that it dosen't have the same nostalgic feeling to it,but a whole new experiance overall. I think this is the best I have ever seen Macross restored visualy,also the soundtrack is soo cool! The opening is waaaay more cool then the Robotech verson.",1182643200,5,1825,4.871382636655949
2451514,3,B000C1VAWY,"Okay, here's the low-down comparing the ADV and Animeigo versions:

Picture Quality

Contrary to popular belief, ADV Films did NOT simply obtain and use Animeigo's telecine transfer.  While it's quite possible that ADV obtained the same FILM masters that Animeigo used, it's apparent that ADV created another (and inferior) telecine transfer for this release.  The issue here is with 3:2 pull-down cadence - you know, where a set of interlaced fields are supposed to be weaved together to form one clean frame.  The Animeigo version had excellent cadence, but ADV's version appears to have foregone proper cadence altogether.  This is most easily detected with a software DVD player, such as WinDVD.  The Animeigo version plays back flawlessly, with straight, smooth lines.  The ADV version exhibits aliasing throughout (ie. jagged lines) and other artifacts involved with incorrectly mixing interlaced fields into a single progressive frame.  Fortunately, my Faroudja-based Denon DVD player is able to sucessfully reconstruct the frames, but most other DVD players out there will be in for a struggle.

Sound Quality

I was quite impressed with the 5.1 English mix.  I was worried that the re-mix would sound a lot like the horrible Transformers box sets that Rhino released.  However, I was quite impressed with the fact that they didn't overblow anything or add blatant sound effects.  I can't confirm if this sound mix the same as the Robotech version released last year.

The Japenese track is very grainy compared to the Animeigo version.  Along with the video issues mentioned above, this further leads me to believe that ADV did not receive anything from Animeigo's archives, and had to obtain everything themselves from different sources.

Voices

Most voices are performed at average to very well levels, with the exception of two characters: Misa Hayase (Monica Rial) and Captain Global (John Swasey).  I think the other reviews on this site already go into the problems with Monica's rendition of Misa.  I will admit that I did start to sympathize with Monica after I listened to her on the audio commentary for episode 4, and how supportive she was for Mari Iijima (Lynn Minmay).  You can hear a sample of Misa's voice in a trailer at the ADV site: [...]

As for Cpt. Global, well, I think it's partly to do with the fact that I was so used to hearing him previously with a Russian accent, and that this almost-no-accent Italian version is quite the change.  Also, he tends to yell and overact too much on the bridge.

Value

I have to say that ADV should've spent more time planning this entire set.  Volume 1 is a set of 2 DVDs.  The first disc is dual-layered, includes the first 4 episodes, the commentaries, and the interview with Mari Iijima.  The second disc is single-layered, includes 2 more episodes, a restoration comparison, ""liner notes"", and an interview with translator Javier Lopez.

This leaves me scratching my head.  Why not have both discs dual-layered, and release more episodes per volume?  Also, why is the upcoming Vol. 2 set only releasing 5 more epsiodes, forcing the set to have to run over 7 volumes?

In comparison, Animeigo only released 4 episodes per disc, but that was because the discs were SINGLE-layered.  A dual-layer disc can easily fit 8 episodes.  My dream set would feature 9 episodes per disc, allowing the entire 36-episode series to nicely fit on 4 dual-layered DVDs.  Considering the strives in MPEG-2 encoding since the birth of DVD 9 years ago, I see this as a very viable option.  Most of the special feautres could be placed on a 5th disc, and the entire set could be released in one relatively inexpensive box.

The way ADV is currently releasing the series, I'm looking at spending a lot of money if I want to collect this entire series.  I wonder if ADV plans to continue releasing the other volumes in 2-disc sets.  Considering Vol. 2 will only include 5 more episodes, this seems like an extreme waste of space.

So you do you need this set?  Well, I would recommend renting it first if possible.  If you can't find it at the local Blockbuster, check out Netflix.  I rented it through Zip.ca, which is the Canadian equivalent of Netflix.  If you can endure the English dub, then go ahead and start shelling out your cash for what will eventually be a 7 disc collection.  I sat on the fence about this for a few weeks but finally decided to pick up Vol. 1.  Will I pick up the other sets?  Who knows...",1142035200,29,4468,4.810775295663601
2451515,5,B000C1VAWY,"As a long-time Robotech fan that has recently purchased and viewed this release, I'd like to give it a balanced review and clear up some obvious mistakes made by other reviewers.

First off, this is NOT a censored DVD. I'm not certain why this claim has been made by another reviewer, but rest assured, it simply is not true. The reviewer ""Peter Payne"" claims that the Minmei shower scene has been edited. It has not been. My only guess is that he really hasn't seen this release and is quoting hearsay. From what I've seen thus far, every scene from the AnimEigo release is included here (with the same outstanding picture quality).

Secondly, I've heard several others state that the sound FX are exactly the same as the revamped 5.1 sounds used in Robotech Remastered. This also is NOT true. Yes, there have been some alterations to various FX to make them 5.1 compatible, but the changes are not as widesweeping as those in RT remastered. I have that entire series, and I directly compared episodes 1-6 of it to this new Macross release (I know... I'm sick), and the latter clearly retains more of the original sounds (although, be warned, not all of them). Overall I think the 5.1 in this new Macross is an acceptable balance between the completely original mono sounds and the overly augmented sounds from RT remastered. Here again, I can only assume that those making the claims have not made a direct comparison. It is correct that the 2.0 Japanese track has all original sounds (although the quality is awful).

Many viewers have stated their disappointment concerning the subs. Overall I would have to say that the subs are mostly a success. The only voice that really grates on me is Roy's (too over the top), although it is true that Hikaru sounds too much like a SoCal dude at times, and Minmei's accent is quite heavy throughout. But in comparison to the original RT voices of Rick (too wimpy), and Minmei (too childish and annoying) I'd say there's been improvement, albeit not perfect. And, of course, Mari Iijima's vocals are vastly superior to those of Reba West, although you won't hear much of it until disc 2 comes out.

All in all, I'm quite pleased with this release and will be purchasing the rest. It's certainly not perfect, but where else are you going to be able to see the original Macross and be able to devote your full attention to the restored visuals? If you're not one of the devout ""anti-subs"" types, then this advantage is for you. The music also sounds spectacular in 5.1, which is a huge bonus for those who love the original Macross soundtrack. There are enough of the original sounds to be excited about, and there are some interesting extras on the discs (unlike the AnimEigo releases).

So it's not for everyone, but there's certainly enough here to even make some finicky fans happy.",1140480000,72,2827,4.6800804828973845
2451516,1,B000C1VAWY,"I was as happy as anyone to hear that Mari Iijima was doing her voice in the new Macross dub, and so I bought the disc. The dub is good -- they do a competent job, although you have to get used to new pronunciations of ""Macross"" and ""Fokker."" However, I will not be buying the rest of these, for the sole reason that they censored the DVD terribly by cutting out Minmei's famous shower scene from episode 4. That's right, one of the most famous scenes in 80s anime, which was left 80% intact by Carl Macek, yet they throw the whole scene out. This is perplexing, since they allow Misa to say ""Oh, S---!"" in a scene where she says nothing of the kind in Japanese. This, and their incessant translation of ""Unified Earth Military"" as ""UN Spacy"" (just to be cute) causeth me to rend my garment.",1139875200,22,791,4.28
2451517,5,B000C1VAWY,"I first watched Macross as ""Clash of the Bionoids"" - a travesty if I ever saw one.  The first Harmony Gold reissue appealed to the kids, but it was not as good as it could have been.  Mari is the original Minmay (something she fought long and hard to separate herself from before, but has now re-embraced the part, keeping it fresh), and no one could be Minmay quite like her.

The clean-up from the older tracks comes through nice and clean, and the dialogue was a whole lot better than the previous versions!  It's great that this will expose Macross to a whole new generation.

Also, if you are a fan of Mari Iijima, there is a nice interview on the first disc where she goes into how the whole ""becoming Minmay"" got started!

If you haven't seen Macross before, now is your chance.  If you have seen Macross before, now's your chance to experience it again....for the first time.",1139184000,8,883,4.447204968944099
2451518,4,B000C1VAWY,"Seriously, was anybody else waiting for the the character voicing Hikaru Ichijyo to say this?  Maybe he will yet...I just can't believe how over the top this actor gets sometimes.
I have mixed feelings about this release (as you can tell).

First off, I have the animeigo set and love them, but something about this translation just doesn't sit right.
The positive:  The visuals of the english release are just as amazing as the japanese, and without having to glance to catch subtitles,  I really SAW a lot more of the restoration work than I'd ever seen before.  I have seen these first episodes 40 times over in various formats, and I saw things with this I have NEVER seen before.  That's great and if you have the japanese release, just turn off the subtitles and you'll get the same effect.

On the other hand the voice acting was uneven at best.  I was delighted by some characters and frustrated by others.  As I aluded to above the actor who did Hikaru sounded like he last did the Teenage mutant ninja turtles and was have trouble getting out of charater.  Misa also gave me fits as it sounded like she was possessed by a 16 year old at times.  Focker was done very well, and most of the others did well too.  Minmay was sometimes jarring to listen to.  She at times sounded older than she did before, which is expected, but it still...The actress gets points for coming back to do the role.  If it wasn't her, and this character sounded the was she does, I think alot more people would have a problem with the performance.  It may be that these actors will come into form as they progress through these roles, but they aren't there yet.

Sound:  The sound effects for the english track, while in 5.1, are the same as that for Robotech Remastered.  In this Robotech Remastered release old sound effects from Robotech were replaced with new.  There were varying reactions to these changed effects, but overall it's not bad if you're not looking for them.  The old sound effects are still there but on the Japanese track, which is not, I believe, in 5.1.

Packaging:  Looks great for the box set.  The box is quality and the art is very nice on the dvd case too.

Extras:  include commentary tracks by the actresses for Misa and Minmay and another by someone involved in the production, which I have not listened to yet.  Also there is the original pilot, ""Space Fortress Macross"", (staring rick yamata) which has some of the actors from Robotech in their Robotech Roles.  This is kinda fun to watch.

Overall, it sounds like I'm being critical of this release.  I'm not, I liked it, but honestly it fell short of my expectations.  It's a good price for what you get, but if you're at all doubtful, rent it first to check it out.",1137974400,8,2737,4.504065040650406
