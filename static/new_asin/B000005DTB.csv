7903334,5,B000005DTB,"I have done Jazzercise for many years, both at classes and at home with tapes/cd's.  I have had this particular workout tape for 15 years now and it is still my most favorite workout.  I love the mixture of dance/aerobics, stretches, floor work and weight work.  The music is nice as well.  I also like that there are varying levels for your fitness level - just follow a particular person in the group! Judy is awesome.  I am 45 years old and have Parkinson's disease, but can still do Jazz!",1254355200,,492,4.4222222222222225
