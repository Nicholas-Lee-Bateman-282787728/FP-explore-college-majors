8062410,5,B0009K7S1K,"This is the best coverage of the Vatican of the several DVD's I have watched.  It is not the longest but that is one of it's bright points.  A & E covered all the same stuff and was able to hit all the major highlights and lowlights of the Vatican in 100 minutes.  The coverage is unbiased and so anyone who just wants to know a good bit about the Vatican, what it is, how it operates and what is the history of this place, will find the A & E production satisfactory.",1400025600,,468,4.010752688172043
8062411,1,B0009K7S1K,This movie has an agenda and it a poor excuse for a movie describing the Vatican.  It is obviously done by non religious people who take a look at the Vatican from a secular viewpoint.,1282867200,2,184,4.257142857142857
8062412,5,B0009K7S1K,"Obviously by the previous ranter's tone you can see that his true opposition lies against Catholisism and the church, rather than this extremelly informative program by A&E. How the word ""revealed"" might solely evoke ""murdering popes"" rather than examination of one of the great places of western culture and art is beyond my simple mentality.
I traveled to Rome as a student for the first time in a semester abroad program during my undergrad education back in 2002 and the summer before that i stumbled upon this video on my universities film library...I can only say that the narrative, story and insight it provides is fascinating for curious individuals and experts on the subject. It is one of my favorite videos because it does not omit insignificat details out of the story like many others and its masterly crafted, to the point that is enjoyable to listen without looking at the screen.
That said it is a historical account of the Vatican, centering mainly in its artistic output and secondly in its political influence through the ages, althoug omitting certain stances and ideas (often seen as disastrous, such as the ones that the previous reviewer was longing for). Nevertheless is an excellent informative resource, and a great piece of academic investigation.",1216166400,17,1275,5.04739336492891
8062413,1,B0009K7S1K,"The word ""Revealed"" in the title lead me to believe this would be a ""revealing"" documentary about the exploits of the many corrupt popes throughout history who have committed adultery and even murder, the hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people ""The Church"" has burned alive or killed in some other horrible manner, or an account of the ""Modernists"" priests who were excommunicated in the late 19th century for suggesting that portions of the Bible be revised to support the archeological evidence scientists began unearthing in the middle of that century.

This propaganda film gushes about how ""grand"" the Vatican library is, and while I certainly won't dispute it's aesthetic beauty, one commentator had the arrogance to claim ""the entire history of the world"" could be found in this library.  This man is either blissfully unaware, or choses to ignore, the Vatican's long history of destroying ancient, original manuscripts that don't support their dogma, therefore making it impossible for the Vatican library to contain ""the entire history of the world.""

And, of course, nothing is mentioned about the decades long effort, and successful one at that (until recently), to suppress the publication of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other archeological findings...more evidence they surely would have destroyed had they had the opportunity.

""The Vatican Revealed"" is an extremely biased propaganda film that was obviously directed, produced and narrated by devout Catholics. There is not one ounce of objectivity to it.  It's a nice, clean, rosey look at the Vatican that I'm sure every good, obedient Christian will enjoy watching...but if you're looking for a more ""revealing"" look at the Vatican, don't be fooled by the title.",1177891200,7,1738,5.259927797833935
