8577015,5,B00C3DIYJ6,"Love this series!  I saw the episodes originally on BBC America and have not seen them since.  Obviously it is not edited for TV.  That made it even funnier!  It is raunchy but there is nothing like this series on TV now.  Highly recommend if you liked ""The Young Ones"" or ""Monty Python"".",1519689600,,288,4.3584905660377355
