7853727,5,6303675042,"Oh What a Night! is a pretty standard nostalgic coming of age film.  One must really wonder, exactly why so many coming of age films take place between 1948 (or so) and 1960.  It must be because those years were within a time of peace and prosperity so driving the car and taking a young lady out ""to park"" is the central theme of gaining adult status.  A coming of age film in the 1930s and 1940s, or post 1965 seems to be automatically involving darker material, Depression, WWII, Vietnam, and after 1991 conflicts in the Mid-East and Balkans.

This film takes place in Ontario and it explores sex from various angles.  There is a dying mother who wishes to meet her replacement daughter-in-law, there is a lonely mechanic, expertly portrayed by Robbie Coltrane, and then there is Eric (Corey Haim) who is struggling with the full on force of sexual desire common in 15 year olds.  One day Eric discovers an older, married woman swimming nude and he falls for her.  The result is a mix of a sexual comedy, and an exploration of adult ideas.

This movie, while good, misses the mark for true greatness in the coming of age genre.  One can see the effects of substance abuse on Haim in this move.  He seems thin and the acting on his part is a bit forced.  He seems a bit of a wash-out compared to the better actors supporting him.  Despite this criticism, the movie is pretty enjoyable to watch.  It plays on common issues affecting all humanity as the develop and it gives one a pretty good laugh throughout.  The mix of serious issues with the slap-stick nature of powerful, nearly uncontrolled sexual energy in teen boys makes for a good story.",1416355200,,1648,4.523648648648648
7853728,3,6303675042,This is another movie I have been looking for for a very long time but it was the PG-13 version. There is a rR rated version I wish I could get,1352764800,,143,3.6451612903225805
7853729,2,6303675042,"Nice story however if there is one thing I don't like about movies is ""rewriting"". That's when they change the language or blur parts of it or cut parts of it. A big no no in my book!!!",1278979200,,185,3.8947368421052633
7853730,1,6303675042,"I have always been a Corey Haim fan and have recently been trying to collect all of his movies...Oh,What a Night happened to be one I was lacking. Usually, just having Corey in the movie is enough for me. I thought I had seen the worst with Demolition University, but this movie is the very worst of the Corey films I have viewed! Not like the Fast Getaway 1 & 2 movies or any other of Corey's movies..this one has no action, no comedy...Corey barely even moves in this film! During most of the movie, he is standing somewhere gazing at one thing or the other, or just into space...Corey doesn't even have a great amount of lines! I thought I had hit bottom with Fever Lake, but NO! Compared to this movie, Fever Lake rates 5 stars on your scale. Don't waste your time or money or your thoughts in thinking that ""something"" has to happen sooner or later to make this movie worth watching...That's what I kept telling myself as I yawned my way through this BORING(a word I never use to describe a Corey movie) attempt at acting. Just don't bother! Trust me!",1096761600,2,1056,4.392857142857143

Corey plays Sam, who get his eyes open for older woman Vera. A delighful movie with good cast. So if you a free a sunday evning, go and rent this movie.",1029456000,2,278,4.264150943396227
7853732,5,6303675042,"Just as I had given up on Corey Haim as a sensible actor he pulls
out his trump card.
This film is set in the 1950`s and is about Girls,Cars and first time love.
Corey Haim plays Eric,a 15 year old boy who works on his Dads
chicken farm.
Eric lives with his Dad and step mom and spends his free time at a lake nearby.
One day he see`s Barbra Williams taking a dip in the nude and starts to fantasize about her.
Eventually he gets closer to her,has a dance at the local fair
and then eventually has a first time experience with her in the Hay barn.
All scenes are very tastefull and rather charming and Corey I
have to say that this film is your best.
It was nice to see him returning to the quality of his earlier
performances such as Lucas,he needs to appear in more films like
this to restore his lost credibilty due to appearing in immature childish rubbish like Fat Getaway 2 and Watchers.
Well worth seeing",999993600,11,911,4.181818181818182
