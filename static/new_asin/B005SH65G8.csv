4884825,5,B005SH65G8,"[This set of DVDs is a companion effort to the Neil Hegarty book of the same name, which I have purchased, read, and reviewed separately.  I read the book first, and then watched the series -- which meant that I'd gotten a lot more historical detail than is included in the DVDs.]

Fergal Keane is a wonderful host and guide through the five hours of this series on Ireland.  The two-DVD series was produced by the BBC and RTE (the latter which is nowhere defined, but stands for ""Raidi Teilifs ireann"")

Along with the printed volume, I found this series to be very helpful in giving me a broad overview of Ireland from prehistory to the present (through 2011). Given how woefully ignorant I am of Gaelic language, British and Irish history and Irish culture, this combo set gave me just the right amount of (read ""dangerous"" amount of) information to predicate our trip to Ireland later this year.

The DVDs allow the producers to do something the text could not:  Bring in a wide variety of visual images about the topics, including places in Britain and on the Continent relevant to the story.  That was very helpful.

Keane also is able to interview a large number and wide variety of scholars and experts throughout the five Episodes.  I found almost all of those interviews helpful and enlightening.

My few complaints should not dissuade you from buying these DVDs.  The photographer had to be enamored with water and waves.  That, and shorebirds flying over water and waves.  OK, I know Ireland is surrounded by water, along with all the lakes and rivers and such -- but half the time spent on proving that photographically would have brought the idea home sufficiently.  At some point it just becomes monotonous and irritating.

The mileage on your DVD player may vary, but when I put in the second DVD (containing Episodes 4 and 5), what I was treated to (and couldn't for the life of me get out of) was an extended commercial from the BBC for their World War II DVD set.  That was unannounced, unexpected, and greatly unappreciated.  Just warning you.  Then again, maybe your DVD player will give you the option to skip.

I would recommend you get both the book (even with its insufficiencies as I've described in my review of it), AND the DVD set.  But if you must choose, I'd probably choose the DVDs.",1358208000,26,2315,4.641277641277641
4884826,5,B005SH65G8,"Fergal Keane starts this five part series on the history of Ireland by talking about how international it was. How it was always more 'connected' to the outside world than we may have previously thought and how it was connected to what was going on around it. How it's story cannot be merely viewed via an isolationist prism. This is a brilliant way of opening up the viewer to the nature of the story they are about to be told.

Effectively this is in many ways a straight telling of the history of Ireland from ancient times of the megalith builders through to Roman times and how Ireland has been so intertwined with that other island so nearby. And it's really Keanes ability to dispassionately discuss so much of the interaction between the isles that sit to the west of continental Europe that did so much to make this series for me. The way he shows the to-ing and fro-ing of peoples, ideas, armies and religions. Speaking on a purely personal level this is my first attempt at learning more about Irish history and I'm glad it was presented the way it was.

As time moves on the action moves more and more from the battlefield (Vikings, Normans, French and plenty of others 'had a go') to the political boardrooms and corridors of power the action does, obviously, become less thrilling from an outright excitement factor but there is a tension of a different kind as the many powers extant in Ireland jockey for position and power. The series bring us up to speed - circa 2010 or so - and at the same time as it is spending time on the political and social machinations you realise it is also taking time to discuss cultural achievements such as literature. The way the whole thing is blended together is extremely well balanced and well rendered. A bunch of talking heads and experts in specific fields are collared to give their opinion and the very physicality of Ireland is used well to provide visual backdrop. The series even takes time to look at the results of mass Irish migration - mainly in terms of the many Irish who went to the new world to try their luck there.

A highly recommended work. Now, it's only left for me to hope The Story of Wales and the Story of Scotland are similarly well rendered!",1357430400,19,2222,4.522388059701493
4884827,5,B005SH65G8,"Identity is a funny thing. Or not. Contentious issues like religion and politics can be polarizing, as is often the case in Ireland. Irish writer and journalist Fergal Keane appropriately begins his dialogue against a stormy Irish coastline, sea crashing against rocks, with the premise that Irish identity has always been less insular and more international than commonly believed. Historically, the ocean was easier to traverse than overland journeys were; many peoples landed on the island, ultimately creating a complex cultural heritage.

""The Story of Ireland"" is an intelligently written narrative, beautifully filmed, and deftly presented by Keane. Ancestors are mentioned: the U Nill, Brian Boru, Aoife MacMurrough, Richard De Clare (Strongbow), among others. Many if-onlys are explored: if only the Spanish and Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, had united effectively in 1601; if only the French had landed in County Cork with Wolfe Tone in 1796 (""We were near enough to throw a biscuit ashore,"" wrote Tone in his diary); if only Michael Collins had lived in 1922 instead of the prude-sycophant amon De Velara, who, as Keane points out, commiserated with the Third Reich via his condolences after Hitler finally committed suicide. Even the premise that the Irish are a defiant people is scrutinized, strong in confronting challenges from without, but then facing abuse from Church authorities. The advent of ultramontanism in the mid-19th century laid a foundation for later corruption under De Velara's government, with no division between Church and State.

Keane moves from the lyrical myth of St. Patrick, to the near past; recent ghosts haunt. Accompanied by a survivor, he visits an infamous orphanage where a forgotten class of the young, vulnerable, and poor were thrown-away into horrific facilities. It has been shown that these industrial-grade, autocratically run bureaucracies were bastions of abuse. He and Keane wander through a graveyard filled with the poignant gravestones of those victims who didn't make it, their humble grave-markers adorned with plastic saints and rosaries. What a grievous irony that this occurred in a land whose unique Irish Gaelic Christianity produced wonders such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-of-Kells/dp/0500277907/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book of Kells</a>, gentle spiritual leaders like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-Columba/dp/0140444629/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St. Columba</a>, theologians like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adomnan-of-Iona/dp/1846821029/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adomnan of Iona</a>, and those who preserved treasures of Western civilization in monasteries and abbeys. In any case, this series is an informative tromp through Ireland's tumultuous stories.

For a long time I thought Ireland started out as an independent country fighting battles with England to remain independent in reality it was controlled by the British and only after a major world war did it break free.
Also some detail commentary on how Northern Ireland influence the turn of events in Ireland itself. I am starting to better understand why Scotland recently took a vote on separating from England. There is a lot of rich history here about the make up the United Kingdom.

4884870,1,B005SH65G8,"Ireland is as mysteriously unknown as it is amazingly known. From this culturally and historically rich land comes some of the most tantalizing and beautiful, if not controversial, stories known to the pantheon of lore and history. Often a footnote and pawn to the powers that be, but not entirely without full autonomy and consequential self-awareness to the greater dramas of Europe and certainly beyond, Ireland is steeped and mired in stories that beg to be told. It is a land that prides itself in the ability if not the requirement to tell a good story. Their cultural music is as distinct as their gift for the gab. Whats more, the BBC is a leader in documentary. And yet, somehow, this documentary of this land, falls drastically, tragically short of being anything worthy of the story it tries to tell.
It is, ""a going with the motion,"" of sorts. The presenter is drab, the ambient music is dull, the story is hastened, and I am left desperately pleading for the documentary to hit its stride. It never does. It is a complete and total waste. You would do better, MUCH better in buying anything produced by PBS such as their NOVA documentary on the ancient peoples of Ireland or better yet, a book. Any book.
And if I am left with any questions on the struggle of Ireland, it is ""what did I waste more? My time? Or my money?""",1390003200,8,1334,4.5625

Likewise, there was much collaboration with the English.  Also, Henry VIII's decision to go protestant has had fateful consequences for Anglo-Irish relations to this day.",1372464000,,421,5.147058823529412

The first episode is particularly interesting as it explores the ancient sites found on Ireland, some of witch go back 10,000 years. While we know nothing of those whose ruins are left behind, it is still fascinating that such a small island could have such a huge impact on history.

The history is very current and comes within just a year or so of our present time. Highly recommended for its presentation and the wonderful use of etchings to tell the story.",1368144000,2,530,4.520833333333333

But then I saw a very different picture when visiting Dublin and learning more about the Potato Famine and the actions of England at that time and other times. The book's apparent attempt at neutrality misses the horrors experienced by Ireland
 and fails to give an appreciation for the English failure to act in times of profound crisis. The book also fails to convey the vehemence of the hatred between Catholics and Protestants.  Maybe seeing pictures and statistical summaries in Dublin that showed things like the paucity of Englush aid and the number Irish that the English sold into slavery presented things in a way that is more difficult to portray in a book, but my view is that the author writes in a manner that is too detached.
