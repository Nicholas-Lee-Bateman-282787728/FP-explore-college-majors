2563530,5,B000FFJYCA,"I must admit when my friend introduced me to this cartoon I thought it was stupid. Then after a few more episodes I started to get into the charters and the story more and now this is one of my Saturday morning necessities. I don't usually like cartoons that have a goofy bad guy but, Jack Spicer is hilarious. Some of his antics really do make me laugh. The villains are just as unique as the main characters. If you like cartoons with an ongoing evolving storyline, good character development, then this cartoon is for you. So gather up your shen gon wu, and get ready for a xiaolin showdown.",1147910400,8,594,4.409090909090909

2563533,5,B000FFJYCA,"I have been waiting forever for this show to come out on DVD. It is absolutely hilarious and very different from the average cartoon. It is about 4 monks who are brought together at a Xiaolin temple to learn the ancient art of the dragon. From there they must embark on a journey to collect ancient objects known as Shen Gon Wu which have magnificent powers. For more info on the show got to IMDB.com or TV.com

2563594,5,B000FFJYCA,"This series is among the greatest in cartoons. The show is advertised purely for entertainment yet it still delivers a message at the end of it all. You can tell the voice actors were just having a blast recording this. There was no getting accustomed to their roles; they WERE the characters. With brilliant writing, throughly explained plots, and authentic characters who grow and develop into these warriors, you cannot help but feel a similar growth in you. Hands down, a definite watch. I watched this show growing up as something to pass the time but watching it again years later, you can appreciate the time and effort the developers invested to deliver such a great product. They expertly blend Eastern mysticism and Western humor and the whole time you are immersed in this complete world, chock full of surprises and personality. The characters are distinct from one another and you see them interact with each other in their own unique ways. With high replay value, an amazing story, and a satisfying ending, Xiaolin Showdown can't help but rank among the best. If you have not seen this show, pick it up and watch it. You'll be begging for more after every episode.",1477785600,2,1178,4.807881773399015

Very sentimental; also the characters develop really well and great coming of the age. In addition, it is a very diverse cartoon. Love the last episode of the series.
However, after watching, please do not attempt to watch it's ""sequel"" Xiaolin Chronicles as it is horrible and demeaning to the original series.",1466640000,,471,4.686746987951807

2563657,5,B000FFJYCA,"I am an big fan of anime and I think the format itself has taken an interest for us to take advantage of it. It has led to heavenly influenced shows like Avatar: the last airbender, The Legend of Korra, and (personality my favorite) Samurai Jack. Xiaolin Showdown is no exception.

This show is about a group of teenagers living under the guidance of monks that are saving the world by collecting all the mystical items called the sen-gong-yu from evil forces of Yu-ya and Jack Spicer. And when two forces get the items, a Xiaolin Showdown happens. I do not want to spoil anything of the first season or the series in general because this show is pretty awesome.

I loved watching it as a kid and even as an adult now I still love show. Why because it has action scenes that have life in them, characters that you actually care about, writing that is tight as a seatbelt, and humor that actually works (including the dragon called Do-go, love him).

If you love anime as much I do, you may love this show. If you are looking some action cartoons, then I highly recommend you this tv series.",1464566400,,1090,4.412935323383085

- The film is colorful but it's not funny. It's also boring. I'm sure that's why it lasted only two seasons. Furthermore, Warner Bros never released season 2 on DVD.

To my backward way of thinking, peddling sex to kiddos is just not cool, and most anime does just that, with a few exceptions (think Kiki's Delivery Service and other such films - in my opinion, they are few and far between). This show doesn't do that - not even in an insidious way - nor does it pit friends against friends (think Pokemon). Perhaps it's because it's not strictly anime.  The humor is terrific. It's a show I can watch again and again with my kids.  Now that's saying something, anime or not.",1203897600,2,579,4.245454545454545
2563815,4,B000FFJYCA,"Warner Brothers really does have some good ideas. Xiaolin Showdown is noticeable deeper than most shows for children. The plot isn't terribly original (four kids fight evil and collect artifacts granting special powers), but the writing has a nice balance between smart, funny and easy to understand for kids.
The real gem in this series is the character development. Omi, the self-proclaimed leader, isn't like your typical good guy. He has moments where he's selfish and wants to be better than everyone, or thinks he can handle things himself. Raimundo argues with Omi a lot, and doesn't care about the missions a lot of the time, while Kimiko has to deal with proving herself as a real warrior. Meanwhile, Clay shows he knows more than a few cowboys puns. The three-dimensional characters really make you care about them because they seem so real. And did you know that this show's first and second season end with cliffhangers? Talk about taking risks.
All in all, Xiaolin Showdown is well recommended for kids and adults alike. Just know that there are lack of bonus features aside from some trailers, but you'll be too busy watching your favorites from Xiaolin's first season!",1185580800,2,1183,4.949748743718593
2563816,5,B000FFJYCA,This is a 2 disk set.  The COMPLETE first season.  Hours of entertainment for everyone.  My son loves this series.  I purchased this for Valentines day for him.

2563817,4,B000FFJYCA,"The first thirteen episodes, presented in this volume, ingratiate you to all the heroes, villains, and recurring characters that appear throughout the series.  If you're here, you likely already know the show, so let me get to the set.

The set is typical, with the thirteen episodes spread out over two discs.  The first disc contains the first 7 episodes, and the second disc has the last 6 episodes of the first (2003-04) season.  I was suprised to find (from the second-to-last episode, and purely by accident) that each episode has six chapters.  This is very unorthodox for shows like this (of 22 min), but it's good to have.

The menus are very simple and don't really seem to have much flow to them.  To tell the truth, most, if not all, of the menus look like they were derived from Kids' WB! wallpapers.

The casing is average.  The two discs come in a black plastic keepcase.  As for the cover design... it's a bit uninspiring, but at least there's new art on the front.  As you've likely heard, the character formation on the back of the case is not in continuity with the show.

With all that said, the best I can give this set is a four out of five.  The lack of extras was disappointing, as well as the fact that the thirteen episodes ended on a cliffhanger.  But, the best feature of this set (aside from the episodes in their crisp and clear presentation) is the inclusion of chapter marks in every episode (though, I doubt that I'll ever use them).

2563818,4,B000FFJYCA,"I don't usually write ""reviews"" (this is my first) but I felt compelled to do so in connection with Xiolin Showdown - Season-1.  I caught a couple EPs of this animated series on Sat mornings via my local FOX station and I always found myself enjoying the wacky world of 4 teens (or ""near teens"") learning the ways of martial arts from their wry humored Xiolin monk master.  The thing that truly caught my attention enuff to purchase the entire season was how much the series reminded me of the ""Shrek"" movies or even the ""neo-classic"" Disney stuff like ""Aladdin"".  The humor in this series reaches beyond gags funny only to kids to include things that ""grown-ups"" can appreciate too.  To seal the deal, the season-1 story arc traverses your run-of-the-mill action/adventure fare by bringing the teens to a place where they learn more than fighting skills to express important values like compassion, friendship and loyalty.  By the last EP of the season you feel like you've witnessed the middle movement of a serious drama where tragedy occurs and you're left longing for the resolve of the next act.  I think this series will take many grown-ups by surprise if they can sincerely devote some focused attention to it - and they'll be happier for the laughs along the way.",1168473600,,1272,4.759090909090909

2563831,5,B000FFJYCA,"It took me several days to write this review, seeing as how I'd have to admit to zillions of online strangers how much I love a kid's cartoon. I swear I don't usually watch this stuff! It's not my fault! I just can't stand any more reality shows!

All right, down to business. Other reviews have covered the basics so I'll gloss over them quickly. Four kids--Clay, Kimiko, Raimundo and Omi--are brought to a temple in China, to train as warriors and locate magical artifacts. These artifacts were de-powered and hidden all over the world thousands of years ago, but are regaining their magical potency one by one. The young warriors must find them before they fall into the wrong hands. Those hands belong to an evil boy genius, his nagging ghost mentor, and a host of other interesting villains.

The artifacts give powers to whoever is holding them at the time, and I have to applaud the creators coming up with such an assortment of pleasing  things. They can let you talk to animals, stretch yourself like chewing gum, summon a whirlwind, blast fire, or fool with the workings of space and time. Most artifacts require skill and discipline to use correctly. Some give you a new ability, but take away one that you already had. Others backfire. A few are too dangerous to be used at all. The characters have to think about using them; they can't just flail them around.

But the show isn't just about finding and mastering weapons--it's also about finding and mastering yourself. And while cartoons that moralize really rub me the wrong way, I approve this time. The characters learn to find the rational way to approach a problem, and even better, consider how their own strengths and weaknesses factor into a situation. A presence of forethought, more than skill or luck, is responsible for the good guys' victories. That's what sets Xiaolin Showdown head-and-shoulders above most other kid's shows.

Speaking of forethought, it has a glorious absence in the monks' adversary Jack Spicer, who is now my new favorite 'villain'. If this show was done live-action, I'd accuse Jack Spicer's actor of stealing the show. A cape-swirling, self-styled ""Evil Boy Genius"", Spicer builds armies of robots, grins and rants, chickens out, gloats and whines about the pitfalls he encounters on his lonely path to greatness. Brilliant yet foolish, egotistical, star-struck, greedy and impulsive, he is Daffy Duck trying his best to be Ming The Merciless. He's not much of a villain, but a perfect troublemaker and hilarious to watch. He's too haphazard--and a bit too nice--to be the evil genius he wants to be, but when he gets his act together, watch out. He has a little knowledge, and it's dangerous.

But Jack Spicer never stops to think about anything, and this begins and ends with him being chewed out by his ghostly sidekick, Wuya. Wuya is the squidlike, floating spirit of an ancient witch, who has teamed up with Jack Spicer for lack of a better partner. She's the brains of the outfit, but very much hampered by the fact that she's not solid and can't do things for herself. She can't force Spicer to do anything, just yell and egg him on, and she would clearly love to smack some sense into him.

None of the villains can get along with each other when they team up, and they double-cross, back-bite and dump each other constantly. The importance of compassion and teamwork is drawn clearly here--if you can't find a way to work with others, you're not going to get anywhere. And the good guys also do less-than-admirable things to each other, out of jealousy or anger, with similar results. Just *saying* they're 'good' is not good enough; the heroes have to learn to walk their talk.

The series explores the idea that humans are neither totally good nor totally bad, and yes, I know, it's just a simplistic cartoon...but the results are pretty interesting. Certain characters cross the good/evil line in either direction, and query each other or themselves on their true natures, especially after Volume One. This is the main reason WB needs to come out with Volume 2 on DVD. Ahem.

You can probably tell that I think this show goes beyond battles, but the fights are great too. When two people want to claim the same artifact, a Xiaolin Showdown is declared and the combatants fight using whatever artifacts they already have. But that, to me, isn't the interesting part; the battlegrounds are. Declaring a Showdown suspends the laws of reality while it's fought, and everything changes to a surrealistic landscape that never fails to amaze me with it's sense and creativity. These showdowns take place in space, in giant pinball machines, in a forest of impossibly tall trees--even a common haystack gets a fever-dream makeover. I love these sequences and, frankly, always wish that the animation was higher-quality so I could enjoy it even more.

Well, that's enough. It's a really good show with heart, brains, humor, a believable theme, magic shiny things and robots and stuff. Hang on for a good wild ride.",1158883200,47,5018,4.8311990686845165
2563832,4,B000FFJYCA,"""Xiaolin Showdown"" is an interesting breakthrough series.  Basically it's about four young monks travelling the globe for mystical artifacts called the Shen Gong Wu.  However, they must face a whole lotta bad guys in order to get the Wu, even if it results in an amazing duel known as the Xiaolin Showdown.

Here's the who's who on the show:

Omi - A young dragon-in-training who is confident in his training at the Xiaolin temple.  Unfortunately, he can't keep up with the times.

Raimundo - A hip Brazillian boy who usually plays it cool, although his attitude sometimes interferes with his teammates.

Clay - A down-home fella from Texas who is usually calm and steady in his training.

Kimiko - A Japanese girl who never wears the same outfit twice in each episode.  She's very high-tech and fashionable, though she's never taken too seriously.

Master Fung - The mentor of Omi and the others with lots of philosophy to boot.

Dojo - A witty, yet stubborn dragon who can grow gigantic in size for transporting the young monks.

Jack Spicer - A sinister boy genius with a love of robotics.  To me, he's really a wimp.

Wuya - The spirit of the Heylin witch who seeks revenge and get as much Shen Gong Wu as she can.

So join our young heroes in thirteen action and laugh packed episodes spanning their travels and their tribulations.  The two disc set is worth buying for, even if there's not much in special features.  Inevitably, this series is very nice if you like shows like ""Teen Titans"" or something like that.",1158192000,4,1520,4.632958801498128

Jack Spicer is my personal favorite just beacsue his combination of streotypical evil, signs of goodness and twists make him to be the most fun and likeable character of the series.
