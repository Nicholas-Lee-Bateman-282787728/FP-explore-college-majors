8463026,5,B0059V0IE8,"One of the great airports, but no longer in use.  The runway 12 approach with the checkerboard is amazing.  I worked for United Airlines and one our pilots told me about it.  He told me if I ever get the chance it is well worth the trip.  The Just Planes video is 6 hours long and well worth the $40 price.",1403395200,,306,3.9672131147540983
8463027,5,B0059V0IE8,"Hong Kong's Kai Tak International Airport was always a popular place for ""plane spotters"" to visit. Kai Tak closed in 1998, but not before the video team from ""Just Planes"" produced many hours of footage of this one-of-a-kind aviation facility. And the majority of that footage can be found on this 2-Disc DVD program, which was first released by Just Planes Videos on March 31, 2004.

The fact that the airport is now closed forever (replaced by the much more modern Chek Lap Kok International Airport nearby) makes any Kai Tak video or DVD even more of a collector's item, since no more video footage can ever be filmed at that wondrous single-runway facility.

This Kai Tak double-DVD set is one of literally hundreds of programs on DVD and VHS video that have been produced by ""Just Planes"" of Boston since they opened their mail-order  business in 1991.

So, if you find yourself in need of a Kai Tak ""fix"", look no further than this excellent DVD set. It contains six solid hours of non-stop action from one of the most exciting and photogenic airports of all-time -- ""HKG"".

Kai Tak was ""widebody"" heaven, with just about every type of heavy jet you can think of putting in an appearance at HKG, and making that sharp right turn at the highly-recognizable ""Checkerboard"" just before touching down.

There are countless views of spectacular and picturesque Runway 13 landings offered up during this mega Kai Tak program, including sixty minutes of coverage from the very last day of operations at the airport, filmed on July 5, 1998.

Also included during the ""Final Day"" segment is in-flight footage filmed from the cabin of a Boeing 747-400 while on final approach into Kai Tak. Great stuff.

And also get ready to witness some cool and crazy-looking vapor trails coming off the wings of many of the Boeing and Airbus jets as they descend on final approach. Hong Kong's often humid days made these fascinating trails of visible condensed air a common occurrence for aircraft bearing down on Runway 13.

Despite the fact that the HKG footage was captured many years ago (from 1995 to mid-1998, which was before Just Planes made the switch to digital camera equipment), the video quality on these DVDs is very good. In fact, in my opinion, it looks excellent for a non-digital video source.

On most occasions, you can even freeze-frame an image with very little blurring, which is nearly impossible to do when freezing a VHS tape. And the Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo soundtrack serves very nicely as well.

Each of the two discs is divided up into six parts (or chapters), with each chapter lasting approximately 30 minutes. The photograph used for the DVD menu background is the same one we see adorning the DVD cover and the physical discs themselves, only the menu image shows it in its full, uncropped form. It's a beautiful photo (taken by Lawrence Chiu) depicting a combination of jumbo jet, Kowloon Bay, Runway 13, and the lights of Hong Kong. A stunning image indeed, that looks all the better on a large-screen TV.

Kai Tak may have closed its gates and its one lone (and very busy) runway in 1998, but this unique and exquisite aerodrome will live on forever on the superior DVD format thanks to some stellar work from the people at Just Planes Videos.

Any plane-watching aviation fan, or anyone who wishes to keep the memory of the great Kai Tak Airport at arm's reach, will want to pick up this 2-DVD set while they still can.
