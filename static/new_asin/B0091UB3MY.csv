8534430,4,B0091UB3MY,"Great as usual.  I get the new Rock 'em Sock 'em every year.  I was, however, expecting more on the glorious return of the Jets.  There's not even a mention.  So bizarre.  I figured showing the opening night ceremony and a quick montage would be appropriate... oh well",1358294400,,268,4.5
