8550834,5,B00AFEOL06,"Few things in upland bird hunting compare to watching a great dog work-Hank never fails to astound-love the philosophy of Dez too, it s great to get birds but that's only part of the experience and story, being outdoors, studying the birds and watching a dog like Hank respond to Dez always inspires... but ""don't spoil your dog!""",1489363200,,330,4.706896551724138
8550835,5,B00AFEOL06,"I don't own this series but remembered watching it on TV back in the 2000s.  That was a few months after my husband passed away and at that time of my life, there was a lot of ""down"" time when I was trying to cope with change.  I'd sit and watch TV in the afternoons just to pass some time and found this great TV series.  My late husband was an ardent outdoorsman and huntsman and, of course, those thoughts were in my mind as I watched Dez & Hank hunt.  I later wrote a letter to Dez telling me how much sweet memories his TV program was bringing to me and he was so very kind to answer me back.  If you love the outdoors and grew up hunting as a young boy (or young woman), then this is definitely for you.  And Hank was one exceptionally fine bird dog - something my late husband would have enjoyed having so much.",1473724800,,818,4.018518518518518

8550837,5,B00AFEOL06,The show evokes a strong nostalgia for a disappearing way of life in this country. Makes you want to move to the country. It helped to spark my interest in hunting when I was just getting started. Thanks Dez!,1444694400,,208,4.358974358974359

8550840,4,B00AFEOL06,"Although always enjoyed the tv series with Hank and Dash I could do without some of the folksy sitdowns. I would  rather see more hunting.

It also appears that they hunt the easy terrain but are always tired after only one flush and shoot.",1394496000,,240,4.431818181818182
