4709755,5,B005ISRAEI,This really knocked me off my chair.  It was one of the best blues albums I have heard in years.  I really had never heard Cindi Lauper before I heard her sing on The View.  I just had to order it immediately and I am so glad.  It really rocks.,1324339200,3,244,3.82
4709756,5,B005ISRAEI,"I have followed Cyndi's career since the 80's... I have seen her perform in different venues (large and small) several times over the years.  She does a great job with whatever material she sings.  Cyndi sounds great on this DVD (and her backing band is excellent, too).  The lady can really sing the Blues... and she looks great doing it, too.  Highly recommended.",1323993600,3,365,4.746031746031746
4709757,5,B005ISRAEI,"Back in the 80s, I made a mix tape highlighting two of my favorite singers,  the great--though much neglected--Tracy Nelson and a then ""promising newcomer"" named Cyndi Lauper.  Why I saw any kind of link between the two would have been hard to explain.  Lauper may have been new on the scene, but she was already something of a pop phenomenon.  Nelson had been in the business for close to 20 years at that point and, at best, remained something of a cult figure.  And Nelson was very much of a traditionalist, musically--her tastes eclectic certainly, but her arrangemets never too far remove from basic American roots music.  Lauper's first record was glossy and synth laden, well done but not really what you might call trad.

But both singers were capable of packing an emotional wallop, and ultimately, that's what counts (at least as far as I was concerned).  I labeled the cassette ""TraCYndi"" and played to it til it it was stretched to the point of unlistenability.  So you can imagine how surprised and delighted I was last year when I learned that Cyndi Lauper had recorded a blues album (MEMPHIS BLUES) and had spotlighted Tracy Nelson's signature song ""Down So Low.""  I felt, well, vindicated and, if I might be allowed a little self-congratulation, kind of prescient, actually.

It's actually not all that surprising that Cyndi would be aware of Tracy's music.  She was a musically aware urban teen, catching all the great blues and rock acts at the Fillmore East. And like so many young people who came of age in the late 60s and early 70s, she was wide open to just about everything.  While blues purists tended to scoff at her statements, made at the time of MEMPHIS BLUES' release, that the blues pretty much provided the basis for everything she's ever done, there is a lot of truth in those assertions.  When Cyndi belted out songs like ""Money Changes Everything,"" or ""Boy Blue"" back in the early days, she evoked no one so much as Janis Joplin, and it came as no surprise to anyone with ears that among her earliest professional gigs were spots with a Joplin tribute band.  She cut her teeth on the blues-rock (which included the less well-known Nelson as well as Joplin) of the era, and like many of her generation, that music inspired her to dig even deeper into the blues.

Lauper's slightly raspy voice is actually quite well suited for the blues.  When she duets with Nelson on the live take of ""Down So Low"" included on this concert DVD/CD collection, it's actually a study in two contrasting blues vocals styles.  Tracy Nelson has always embodied something of the gospel tradition in her rich, stately vocals.  Cyndi has more of a ""whiskey voice,"" and brings a kind of earthy sassiness to her blues numbers, including ""Down So Low.""  The two singers provide an interesting counterpoint to each other.  You could almost describe it as a course in Blues Singing 101.

Lauper's other guest artists in this project include Jonny Lang, whose gritty vocals also complement Lauper's effectively and whose sense of showmanship matches the singer's own.  Expert accompaniment is also provided by such legendary figures as Allen Toussaint and Charlie Musselwhite.  The frequent close-ups of Toussaint attacking the keyboards are just revelatory.  I could watch him forever.

There's a confidence to the live performances included on this DVD that is particularly impressive.  MEMPHIS BLUES was a solid enough record, but after having toured and lived with this material for many months, Lauper and crew bring real authority to the live versions of the songs from that CD, as well as a few ""bluesified"" blasts from the past, including ""She Bop"" (a pop tune that always has a kind of sly and bluesy erotic--or, more accurately, auto-erotic--sensibility behind it), ""Change of Heart"" and ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun,"" as a closer.  These tunes aren't exactly ""converted"" into blues numbers, but the blues touches lend credence to those claims about the blues serving as a basis for Lauper's music all along.

And part of that basis is the level of conviction that Lauper brings to her interpretations of all her material.  Even at her poppiest, Cyndi Lauper was an emotive singer whose vocal gifts were always apparent and whose interpretive abilities placed her head and shoulders over the competition of the day.  She has only gotten better over the years.  Her largely ignored 90s albums, HATFUL OF STARS and SISTERS OF AVALON demonstrated her growth as a songwriter and interpreter.  Her more recent ""genre"" efforts AT LAST, THE BODY ACOUSTIC and the ""return to dance music"" BRING YA TO THE BRINK demonstrated a certain restless eclecticism that continued on into the more recent blues projects.  It all makes for an impressive body of work.

With every new project, it seems that more and more people catch on to the fact that Cyndi Lauper is a talented artist and  not just a popster who released a few novelty records over 25 years ago.  One of the OTHER differences between her and a neglected talent like Tracy Nelson is that someone who's enjoyed the level of stardom that Lauper has experienced also has to contend with the BURDENS of fame and all its attendant expections, stereotypes and absurdities.  She has often expressed her desire to be taken seriously as a musician.  Projects like TO MEMPHIS WITH LOVE offer ample proof that she deserves as much.",1321660800,20,5382,4.840437158469945
4709758,5,B005ISRAEI,"The sound quality on this DVD is not just good, it's almost too good. What Cyndi Lauper and her team seem to have chosen is to record each of the instruments at the live performance directly, then studio mixed the sound so that there's never a vocal fallout of a screechingly loud horn moment or whatever. The sound is beautifully modulated, so much so that it sounds too good to be live, if that makes sense.

At first, I must admit I was taken aback by it in a not-so-positive way. Then a few songs in I got used to it. By the end it almost seemed innovative. Every artist mixes their studio albums for perfect balance, so why not do the same for a live recording?

When you watch a live concert on video you have a certain expectation about the sound quality. This DVD will definitely surpass your expectation. Whether that's a good thing or not is up to you.",1320624000,17,862,4.314814814814815

8474987,4,B005ISRAEI,"I just saw Cyndi @ Honda Center in July. We were late getting to the concert ; had I been aware she could perform as she did , we wouldn't have. So, hence , I was PROMPTED to order Cyndis live dvd. It didn't  disappoint me. She is indeed phoenominal.",1408579200,,250,4.0

8474989,5,B005ISRAEI,Fast delivery. This was a great DVD. Great sound. Cyndi Lauper has a great voice no matter what music she singing too. This time it's the blues. Great band.,1406764800,,156,4.413793103448276
8474990,5,B005ISRAEI,"I had the Memphis Blues CD almost as soon as it was available and it is great.  I was thrilled when To Memphis With Love was released.  Cyndi Lauper has put together a great blues band and has great guest musicians including Allen Touissant, Tracy Nelson, Charlie Musselwhite and Jonny Lang.  Her voice is well suited for blues and she channels some of her early musical influences.  She takes the blues and makes them her own while still showing that girls just wanna have fun!",1403136000,,478,4.588235294117647
8474991,5,B005ISRAEI,"This import combination CD/DVD is a great package.  I love the songs, but wish there had been songwriter credits.  I loved the nutty Nilsson recording of ""Early in the Morning.""  Lauper rips through the tune with wild abandon, ""I ain't got nothing but the blues.""  ""Romance in the Dark"" slows the pace a bit and milks that classic slow blues burn, ""There's not one sound, just the beat of my poor heart in the dark.""  ""How Blue Can You Get?"" continues that slow smoking pace, ""My love is like a fire; yours is like a cigarette.""  Lauper's pairing with Tracy Nelson on ""Down So Long"" is a stunning performance with the two seeming to draw energy from the other.  Jonny Lang's guest run on ""Crossroads"" launches that classic track into the stratosphere, ""Standing at the crossroads trying to flag a ride.""  ""I Will Follow"" smokes totally and grabs you by the collar and will not let go.  ""Don't Cry No More"" also pops delightfully, ""Cry me a river, cry me a sea, then I'll believe without a doubt that you really love me.""  The set concludes with some Lauper classics adapted by this great blues band, ""She Bop,"" ""Change of Heart"" & ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.""  The DVD sounds and looks great.  Lauper is so involved in the music that she barely looks at the audience, but the shots show them dancing and listening with rapt attention.  This deluxe import is the red carpet version of this excellent set.  Enjoy!",1374278400,,1411,4.569721115537849
8474992,5,B005ISRAEI,"This is one great dvd! Cyndi has always been known for her great live performances and this doesn't fail any expectation! The behind the scenes insight is a nice plus! If you love Cyndi, you will love this DVD!",1367798400,,210,4.410256410256411
8474993,3,B005ISRAEI,"I love Cyndi and have seen her MANY TIMES in concert through the years. I understand that this is a 'concept' DVD (which also includes a CD); but it seems to lack the excitement that Cyndi is capable of eliciting.  It is what it is; a tribute to some of her favorite classic 'blues' tunes that she wanted to release in a 'documentory/concert' format.  I also understand that she has a confound interest in jumping from genre to genre; but sometimes I am confused by the song choices that she makes.  Fair or unfair; I like 'The Cyndi' who BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER--and gives a performance that is more 'over the top' than this one. Maybe my expectations are ""too high""; but it seems to me that based on her most unique voice--that, when she chooses genres that don't capatitalize on her vocal skills, I feel disappointed.  I wish that she made the songs on 'TO MEMPHIS WITH LOVE' a little more unique in 'more extremely' veering away from the melodies in order to establish herself as a true 'vocal stylist'.",1363996800,,1009,4.497267759562842
8474994,5,B005ISRAEI,"I have always enjoyed Cyndi Lauper,I've always loved the blues. When I saw this dvd. Cyndi Lauper sings the blues, how interesting,so I bought it only to find it fantastically great. Cyndi sang the blues better than I was hoping for. Although this is not a straight concert,with talking between some song. This is recommended.",1363132800,,326,4.945454545454545
8474995,5,B005ISRAEI,"A few years ago former Kweskin Jug Band vocalist, Maria Muldaur (remember her breakout single ""Midnight at the Oasis""?) turned out three tribute CDs paying honor to the great women blues singers. And all were terrific. Pop diva Cyndi Lauper is doing something similar here with the DVD/CD project. Recorded in a Memphis club in early 2011 - as a follow-up to her 2010 blues CD, Lauper held control over the project. You'll note that the DVD is subtitled ""A Film By Cyndi Lauper"". She called in some big names to add some power to her band - Allen Toussaint and Charlie Musslewhite - and holds her own on stage. The DVD contains some rehearsal footage and backstage banter and you can hear Lauper's well known squeaky (almost ""Betty Boop-line"") voice. But when she starts to sing she really does sound a lot like Muldaur. There's CD in the package too so you can just enjoy the music away from your TV.

The camera work is first rate and the image on the Standard DVD was sharp and clear on my 32-year old TV!  While much of the show are blues numbers, Lauper includes a few of her pop hits - ""She Bop"" and the Robert Hazard-penned ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" - which some may feel are out of place but I enjoyed hearing in the ""Memphis clothes"".

There are two ""bonus"" features as well. Both are studio performances of blues classics """"Wild Women Don't Have The Blues"" and ""Crossroads"".

I wonder what genre the multi-faceted Lauper will explore next?

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
