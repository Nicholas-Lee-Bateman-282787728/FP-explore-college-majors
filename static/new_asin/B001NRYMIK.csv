8327828,5,B001NRYMIK,"This movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I got a copy of this movie and wasn't sure what to expect, but I was blown away. It has everything you would want in a scary movie: ghosts, murder, a crazy father, and a spooky church. The movie really makes you think back to the 1980's horror movies that have the deranged killer haunting a family, but this movie takes it one step further. I don't want to ruin the movie for you, but trust me it is great.

The DVD has some great bonus material. It has a very in depth behind the scenes documentary with the writer/director that explains how several aspects of the movie were written and filmed. Definitely worth the price.",1240358400,2,691,4.2748091603053435
