8016523,5,B0001US5V0,"The series came from a concept by Hiro Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Totoro, etc), after starting work on it.  He moved from the project and was later taken over by Gainax director Hideaki Anno (who also worked with Miyazaki on Nausica of the Valley of the Wind) and other projects like Neon Genesis Evangelion.

The Story loosely follows Jules Verns 2000 leagues under the Sea storyline , following the travels of two Young teens, Nadia who does not know where she came from and Jean a young French boy.  As they adventure together to find the Secret of the bluewater which Nadia carries around her neck.  This is a good video for young adults or anyone who like the works of Miyazaki or Anime style animations.

The video quality is not as good as the new remastered video for Bluray and DVD.  But if you're like me and watched it first on VHS, still has the same English voice actors, used for this production.",1454025600,,908,4.539877300613497

Thanks,

8016525,5,B0001US5V0,"The title says it all. If you can get past the old style of animation you will enjoy this anime's story and characters.

Also, if you liked Last Exile you will find that Nadia is just as good, if not better IMO.",1182816000,,211,4.023809523809524
