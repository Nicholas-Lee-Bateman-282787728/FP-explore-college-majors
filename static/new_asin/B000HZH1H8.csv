A gunfighter, gambler, civil war spy, Indian fighter, peace officer, Hickok was said to have killed more than 100 men but the real total was closer to 10. Widely recognized as the man, who won the first classic gunfight on the streets of Springfield Missouri in 1865. He was shot dead in Deadwood South Dakota ten years later. This DVD explores the man, the myths, and his legends like nothing else you have ever seen.",1212796800,,502,4.588888888888889
