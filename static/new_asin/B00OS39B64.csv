8684679,5,B00OS39B64,"I visited the school in 2016 and witnessed The Rule in action. Powerful! The students respond to the leadership from teachers and students alike. ""When one hurts, we all hurt"" is the school motto and it shows. For many of the students, this is home and a good replacement to the gang life. The monks could have chosen to live in a rural setting but they chose to live in the inner City of Newark. I was blessed to see the school first hand.",1458345600,2,440,4.25

8684682,3,B00OS39B64,"This film wants to be excellent, but it doesn't quite make it. It's a bit too long & seems to lose focus. Is it about the school? Or about the monastery? True, the monastery & the Rule sets the agenda & pace of the school. But some of the quasi-romantic monastery vignettes draw the focus away from the focus on the school. As for the history of the school's reopening the film lacks accuracy, partially due to some monks telling only part of the story. How are they able to sustain their mission financially? It's certainly quite admirable & deserving of praise. But if it can't be sustained it has a major flaw. And are the 13 monks who left racists? There were several reasons why they left & some had nothing to do with race. When the school closed the monastery's viability was in serious jeopardy. And there's also the implication that the difficulties the students face at home are urban problems. While they may be more common in urban settings they certainly exist in the suburbs. They are human problems.",1437609600,2,1014,4.576923076923077
8684683,5,B00OS39B64,"Sadly this ended up being a ""farewell gift"" to a teacher in my school. I wanted him to see this as it reminded me of the great way he reaches/teaches to the whole student. Very inspiring. Very.",1435536000,2,193,4.243243243243243
