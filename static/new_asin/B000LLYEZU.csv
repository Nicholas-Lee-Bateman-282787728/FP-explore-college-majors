2710193,5,B000LLYEZU,"This drama has no sex, violence, or even foul language. But it is one of the greatest romantic dramas you will ever see.

It was a huge hit in Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Phillipines, and even North Korea (smuggled in through China). This drama almost single handedly started the Korean Wave (Hallyu) throughout asia and has led the way for other Korean Dramas gaining a huge fan base and viewership.

Although this drama is now over 6 years old, the theme of this drama is eternal. You can watch this drama many times without being tired of it, which to me, is one of the best tests of a good drama.

The music of this drama is heartwrenchingly beautiful. The soundtrack of this drama was also a big hit throughout asia.

So what makes this drama so special?

I believe the producers went through great lengths to depict true love. For example, the producers filmed the drama in a remote village where people have a strong sense of community and humanity. The village is surrounded by beautiful trees, clear rivers, and wide open spaces. It is not so surprising a love of innocence and purity can be formed between two people in such a surrounding.

The child actors in this drama were unforgettable. They were even better than their adult counterparts!

This drama propelled its 3 main actors into stardom in Korea. It also propelled one child actress (Moon GeunYoung) and one supporting actress (Han ChaeYoung) into stardom.  Song Seung Hun (Joon Suh),  was the veteren actor at 24 at the time. He was by far the most polished of the actors. Won Bin (Tae Suhk), who was only 22 at the time, also acted well. Song Hae Gyo (Eun Suh), who plays the main female character, was only 18 and it was her first role. Her lack of experience on center stage was little bit apparent in many scenes. But she still did a commandable job since her role was a very demanding and complex one.

Contrary to popular opinion, I do not believe this drama is overly sad. Although you will cry throughout this drama, it is only because the happy moments are so touchingly beautiful, and when sad things happen to people who were so happy, the sadness becomes more compellingly felt.",1171324800,37,2183,4.603092783505154
2710194,5,B000LLYEZU,"By far the BEST Love story I have ever watched EVER. Song Seung Heon was fantastic; so charming, so emotional, a romantic & just electric. I could NOT keep my eyes of his every line in the movie. I cried through out the entire movie. Thank you so much for the English subtitles. USAfan.",1337904000,2,286,4.314814814814815
2710195,3,B000LLYEZU,"The English subtitles are pretty awful. For instance, ""tie seat belt,"" ""father him knowing cancer have long time"" and ""I will fetch you"" when they mean I'll take you there. But if you have a sense of humor, it's all part of the experience and actually quite fun coupled with a real tearjerker.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AUTUMN-IN-MY-HEART-KOREAN-DRAMA-8-DVDs-with-English-Subtitles/dp/B000LLYEZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AUTUMN IN MY HEART KOREAN DRAMA 8 DVDs with English Subtitles</a>",1313452800,2,537,7.151515151515151
2710196,3,B000LLYEZU,"I thought Id give one of these Korean dramas a whirl for my wife.  We also have a couple of boys 7 & 13 at the time.  We were all hooked, and enjoyed watching the series.  However, somewhere around disc 7 or so, the drama got a little too dramatic; too many barely missed connections, too many tradgedies, too many misunderstandings.  Perhaps if you are a fan of these thats what its all about.  The great thing for us is that we have new family soundtrack! Its amazing how many simple situations in life can become quite entertaining when accompanied by a few hummed bars of the Autumn in my Heart theme.  Miss the bus? run deperately behind it arms outstreached while humming.  Goldfish died? da.. da-da-da de da... etc, etc.  So, Im probably not going to watch this again, but Id probably buy it again if I had it to do over.  Your tastes may vary...",1279497600,4,853,4.382165605095541

2710198,5,B000LLYEZU,"This was too good and horribly sad. I mean SAAAAAADDDDD! If you're feeling down and just want a good cry, buy this video. If you want a good love story, buy this video. I won't say anything more because all the other reviews will tell you about the story. Just know this... ITS WORTH BUYING.",1218585600,4,291,4.3090909090909095
2710199,5,B000LLYEZU,"This is the first Korean drama that I saw back in the day.
I think this drama has all, great actors, great OST, and great story.
As I saw all the 4 Endless Love dramas, I think this is the best, second will be Winter Sonata.
This is not a long drama, so really suitable and great for any newbies.",1216944000,2,296,3.95

2710202,5,B000LLYEZU,This is a good story and a real tear jerker. If you like to cry watch this story. When we first got the DVD we stayed up all night watching because we were interested in what would happen next. This kind of expectation can only be captured with good direction and story telling and with the right actor for the right part. I like all of the four season and this one ranks up high among them. Thanks again for the good music.,1183420800,5,424,4.120481927710843
2710203,5,B000LLYEZU,"This is one of my most favorite Korean drama series! It is an interesting story of hardship and love that utilizes many K-Drama themes (rich vs poor, love triangles, and fate).  Despite using such conventional themes, it is unique, touching and beautifully done.  In addition, it's stars are some of the most attractive ever!

Warning:  Do not watch unless you have a huge box of Kleenex.",1182038400,9,388,4.833333333333333

I was aggravated with it a couple times for getting mellow dramatic in an unrealistic way. Overall the story and the acting was very good but very, very, sad.",1396828800,,319,4.161290322580645
8162084,4,B000LLYEZU,"Yoon Joon-suh and Yoon Eun-suh are very close siblings in a loving family. But Eun-suh's family and another's worlds are turned upside down when a car accident reveals that Eun-suh's blood type is different from the rest of the family. Turns out, Eun-suh and her rival classmate, Choi Shin-Ae, were switched at birth. The parents make the painful decision of switching them back to their respective households. Shin-Ae moving into a wealthy family and Eun-suh moving into poverty. The parents and siblings of each family's personalities are quite the opposite too. Shortly after the switch, the Yoons decide to live abroad, leaving Eun-suh behind in Korea.

Many years later, as adults, the once brother and sister are reunited along with their families. But this time, Joon-suh and Eun-suh are falling in love with each other. The forbidden love between these two crosses so many lines that neither family or friends are willing to accept it. But just as these two and their loved ones are desperately trying to work out their problems, something horrible and unexpected happens. Eun-suh is dying from cancer and only has a short time to live. What will happen now?

Autumn in My Heart is the first installment of the Endless Love series. This series is based on the seasons. The other three Endless Love dramas are: Winter Sonata, Spring Waltz, and Summer Scent. None of these four dramas stories are related, other than in mood and feeling. Each tell a different story with different characters.

This was an entertaining and interesting story line that pulled me right into the drama. Two once siblings falling in love with each other touches a unique and conflicting topic. I just had to keep watching to find out what happens next. It's extremely sad though. I cried through the entire drama and I'm not much of a crier. It's a very emotionally exhausting drama. I didn't watch the other installments of the Endless Love series right after, just because I need an emotional break and have the need to watch something happier and funny. The way Autumn in My Heart ends is sad, but heartfelt, shocking, and unexpected in some ways. It was very well done. If your interested in these kinds of dramas, I highly recommend watching it. But you might need a Kleenex box beside you at all times.

(16 episodes) (Many talented popular actors star in this drama, like Song Seung Hun, Song Hye Gyo, Won Bin, and Han Chae Young.)",1388275200,,2423,4.831325301204819
8162085,4,B000LLYEZU,"Autumn In My Heart is a profoundly sad and deeply moving story of one man's love for another woman amidst circumstances that continually drive the two apart.  The overall plot contains cultural implications of incest even though, technically, no incest exists.  This creates deep dramatic tension as the conflict evolves from a secret to common knowledge between family and friends.  Romantic interests become confused and the relationship between main characters begins to deteriorate.  The final resolution to the story's main conflict parallels the concept of fall acquiescing to the inevitable stillness of winter, which brings natural closure to the life that once was spring and summer.

My wife is Chinese and she first saw this series while living in Nanning, China before coming to America.  She and her sister lived together while raising her sister's daughter, who was too young to follow it at the time.  She tells me it is perhaps the most painful story she has ever watched and she and her sister cried incessantly through the sixteen episodes.  Sometime later she watched it again, which proves its staying power in holding up with repeated viewings.  My wife is not one to watch the same show over and over.

After arriving in America, she introduced me to Korean dramas.  I was skeptical that I would actually enjoy them but found that some of them are really quite good.  I've watched a number of them, my favorite are all of Yoon Seok-ho's installments, of which Autumn In My Heart is one.

Autumn In My Heart is the first of four serial dramas Yoon Seok-ho created in his Endless Love tetralogy.  Each follows the seasons both thematically and symbolically.  Along with Autumn In My Heart (2000), he also created Winter Sonata (2002), Summer Scent (2003), and Spring Waltz (2006).

It had been a number of years since my wife has seen this series at the time that I played the first episode on Netflix.  When the first episode started and the opening theme song began, she put her little hands to her delicate lips and said, ""Oh tian a!"" (""Oh my God!"") as her eyes began welling with tears.  Just hearing the opening theme, which she had forgotten, had caused her to react.  She remembered all the painful emotions attributed to this longsuffering series.  We watched every episode together and she cried her way through it once more.

While she intensely loved this series, I liked it.  I'll give you my perspection, as an American male.  I've seen all four of the Endless Love installments.  After seeing each one, to me, Autumn In My Heart seems less polished all the way around.  The production quality increases as you work your way through the Endless Love series.  My favorite was Spring Waltz, which I thought was excellent.  My wife's favorite was this series, Autumn In My Heart.

With that said, I don't mean to downplay this series.  It is very well done and a groundbreaking series in the world of Korean drama.  It has many deeply moving scenes that will pull at your heartstrings.  If you're moved by emotional serial dramas that are driven by love and relational conflict, then this series is worth viewing.  If you like it, then you have three others to enjoy that, in my opinion, build wonderfully on the production quality, directing, character development, and acting.  The soundtrack for each of Yoon Seok-ho's dramas is very well done and each has been released on CD.

Autumn In My Heart is a study in human emotion under intense emotional duress.  It analyzes the deepest depths of the human condition and the feelings of personal loss.  Profound and moving, it is a series that set a new direction for Korean serial dramas.",1360713600,9,3668,4.822115384615385
8162086,5,B000LLYEZU,"This series started it all for me...I've never seen or watched any korean drama until Autumn in my Heart and now I am forever hooked. The series was beautifully done...really sad at the end.  But the love that they have for each other is truely what inspired this series.  Wow, I wish I have two guys fighting over my love, lol.  And also the love of the parents are so sincere and heart warming especially the mom.",1354924800,3,415,4.363636363636363

8162088,2,B000LLYEZU,"After sitting through 12 episodes and crying in each one, I decided to check Wikipedia to see how it ended.  I could not sit through the remainder if the ending was sad.  Sure enough, it was extremely sad.  This movie, in my opinion, was a real downer.  I deleted all the episodes.

If you want to see a thoroughly entertaining and funny movie, watch ""Pasta"", another Korean movie.  The actors are wonderful, there are many funny moments, and best of all, the ending is so satisfying and happy.",1342569600,2,494,4.556818181818182
8162089,4,B000LLYEZU,"So, I have watched lots of K-drama's and have used the Korean verison of Boys over Flowers as my benchmark of a true 5 star show. I give this one a solid 4 out of 5. Since it is the typical young girl in love/ rich boy story line, I really liked it.  It is very sad from the get go and remains that way.  It's more realistic than the typical K-dra story line.  I would recommend for any K-dra fans.",1341878400,2,398,3.888888888888889
