2630638,5,B000H7JCFA,I thought these episodes were hilarious. It's too bad they didn't make more!,1173312000,,76,4.923076923076923
2630639,5,B000H7JCFA,"This show is so funny, I cannot believe that it didn't last long. The same people that created South Park made this so you know it's gonna be hilarious. It used to come on Comedy Central late at night but I haven't seen it in a while so I decided to buy. It's fun to make fun of the president.",1171065600,,293,3.9
2630640,5,B000H7JCFA,"I love the way the episodes come off like a cheesy 80's comedy only to provide a surprising amount of disgusting and somewhat offensive humor.  That's what makes That's My Bush so great.  The theme song is something *very* close to a show like Alf or Night Court, or some other 80's show.  But when the show actually begins, and the storyline and characters arrive, you quickly realize this is certainly not a rip-off of some cheesy 80's show.

The actors that are supposed to look like George Bush and Laura are pretty decent, though not the best lookalikes I have seen.  The guy who imitates George Bush occasionally on the Jay Leno show would have fit the part better, in my opinion.  Still, this Bush is a pretty good pick.

I think the best thing about That's My Bush is how there's actually stories surrounding all the characters, and it's not just your typical ""Bush is dumb"" jokes (which is the kind of humor most people are known for when it comes to insulting President Bush).  Don't get me wrong, Bush is portrayed as a dummy more often than not, but it's NOT the only thing the storylines focus on.

I love the Dick Cheney and Barbara Bush characters.  Dick acts just like his first name, and Barbara is a super ""b-word"" when it comes to trying to accept Laura as George's wife.  It makes you wonder if Barbara and Laura really DO get along in real life.  George Bush's character can be dumb sometimes, but not ALL the time.

The writers do a great job mixing in other characters so not all the attention centers around Bush.  There's also a cheesy laugh track in between all the jokes to again make the show feel like we've warped back to the 80's.

A great, catchy theme song with jazzy instruments suits a very good, overlooked, and short-lived comedy show.",1170460800,,1772,4.49375
2630641,5,B000H7JCFA,"Not many extra features, but still worth the money. A very funny look at what was to come, no wonder we're stuck in Iraq.",1169337600,,121,4.083333333333333
2630642,4,B000H7JCFA,"A hilarious spoof on George Bush's life in the whitehouse as president.

All 8 episodes made are on this 2 disc set. I'm glad they where all there, but they really could've done these on one disc. Trey and Matt's commentary was a waste of space i.m.o. They do talk some interesting stuff about the show but they only talk for about 2 minutes during the start of each episode.  The entire 20 mins of commentary isn't really worth a whole audio track to take up space on the disc and would've been better to just show them talk about about the shows for 20 mins instead of just talking for 2 mins then they leave and it just has the audio of the show.

I turned the cast commentary off after 2 episodes, it was just the usual ""haha, you where so funny there *laugh*laugh* oh whats his name? I saw him last week at K-mart buying toothpaste"" ...Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

All the shows are there, it's too bad this show didn't run longer then it did.

Great laughs, great comedy, great DVD buy except for the sh** commentaries.",1163548800,2,1012,4.361702127659575
2630643,4,B000H7JCFA,"If you're looking for hard-hitting political satire, save your money. Although it has actors playing George W. Bush, Laura Bush and Karl Rove, ""That's My Bush"" is not remotely about the real Bush administration.

Rather, the show is a parody of formulaic television. The premise is a standard family situation comedy about an ordinary doofus whose job just happens to be President of the United States. Tour groups walk through the living room during family fights. An obnoxious neighbor walks right in whenever he likes. The laugh track is one of the most important elements of the show, over-reacting to deliberately lame jokes and supplying dirty hoots whenever the president's dumb blonde secretary walks into a room. There's a tagline (clearly inspired by The Honeymooners) repeated at the end of every episode, with the ""audience"" joining in: ""One of these days, I'm gonna punch you right in the face.""

Each episode combines a serious topic with a timeworn TV situation: drug control and trouble with the mother-in-law, or missile defense and an illegal cable-TV hookup. Don't expect any light to be shed on the serious topics. It's all played for laughs.

If you're easily offended, save your money. There aren't many subjects Matt Stone and Trey Parker consider off-limits. The show isn't as scatological as South Park, but if you're prone to offense-taking, Stone and Parker are out to get you, and they're almost certainly going to succeed. If you can take it, there is some hilarious stuff here.

It's good there were only 8 episodes -- many more would have run the risk of turning it into one more goofy situation comedy.

Each episode includes an audio commentary track with Stone and Parker, and another commentary track with the entire regular cast. But, if you buy DVDs primarily for the ""extras,"" save your money. Each commentary lasts only a few minutes at the beginning of the episode. There are no other extras.

If, in spite of all these warnings to save your money, you buy this anyway -- well, I think you'll enjoy it. I did.",1162166400,36,2049,4.890489913544669
2630644,5,B000H7JCFA,"One of my favorite episodes of this short series is the when Prez. Bush bands all guns and gets an attack bear to protect himself from a death omen from a fortune teller. With a gun-crazed Carliton Heston thrown into the mix, the show was an instant classic. The show had potential before 9-11. Hopefully, Comedy Central will breath new life into this series.",1160870400,5,359,4.625
2630645,5,B000H7JCFA,"Let's not forget that Parker & Stone were planning this series well in advance of the 2000 election, with the intent of using whoever ended up in the White House as their lead character.  Which means that anyone who is offended by it being a show about Bush would probably have loved it if it had been THE EXACT SAME SHOW, only with Gore instead.

Or, as close to being the exact same show as the scripts would allow.

Five stars for the series itself.  I'll rate the DVD after I see it.",1158969600,7,487,4.204301075268817

Fans of Southpark might have to be a bit higher on the intelligence scale to understand some of the jokes but, for those of us who have gotten older and still appreciate this duos still going strong famous show...well...it's time to graduate.  Sadly this got cancelled before it could be even more relevant.  Not only is the president presented as a bumbling idiot...he is presented as a bumbling idiot who tries not to be.  Episodes mock all of the current hot button issues of the time while at the same time making a mockery of all 2 camera sitcoms in general.  Enjoy the cheesy-ness that is Golden Girls and any other vapid 'teen' sitcom with hollow characters?  Then this one is for you.  Annoying neighbors, smartass maids, and ditzy sexpot blondes; they are all here!  Enjoy what is soon to become a solid cult classic with the dvd release.

The only bummer is that the commentaries from Matt and Trey are only a few minutes at the beginning of each episode. Would have loved to hear them interacting with the cast but just happy to have the show on DVD with ANY extra features.

The show is a silly, over-the-top parody of television sitcoms but it's odd to watch it again knowing that 9/11 would happen about half a year later. It's only worth mentioning as this show, as silly as it is, never would have been made after 9/11. Watching it feels like a weird look back at a more ""innocent"" time.

2630673,5,B000H7JCFA,"Brilliant, Smart, Ergo Doomed to Fail!

Seems like anything smart, brilliant, intelligent, different, fresh, or innovative is doomed to fail without much opportunity to prove itself. At least, in the vast wasteland of television in America.

Perhaps it started with Star Trek, cancelled after only 3 seasons of 5 originally contracted, and hamstrung by a restrictive budget, the show never was allowed to reach full potential. The same fate suffered by the equally innovative and brilliant Firefly series that never actually got through their first season before being axed by short sighted execs. Both have spawned cult followings that have kept them from fading into obscurity.

That same fate struck this wonderful, quirky, funny series called ""That's My Bush!""
Ahead of its time, sassy and smart, TMB was doomed to fail because it dared to break the mold and boldly go where no comedy had gone before. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the brown coats of American media, left the cookie cutter notions of generic sitcoms behind and warped into uncharted territory. Breaking new ground in each episode, slaughtering sacred cows with gleeful impunity, they produced something that is destined to succeed as a cult classic beyond memory of the tripe produced for mass media consumption.

This series ain't for everybody. No doubt about that. But for those that grok the thing, it is pure viewing pleasure, and I give it 5 stars!",1382140800,,1423,5.094420600858369

2630695,5,B000H7JCFA,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone had a gem when this show was in play - and then 9/11 came and rearranged the way we were allowed to see the world. That's sad, too, because this show was unique in its own right and it made Bush seem (this is hard to type) likeable. Much like Norm walking through the doors of Cheers, Bush walking through the doors of The White House had that type of impact. There were the other characters that we needed, too: there was the Dr. of Death himself (Jack K.), their neighbor that always told a bad joke and always did something that got George in trouble (like stealing cable or filling his hollow head with painful question marks), Laura, Karl R., their housekeeper, and the eyecandy named Princess. It had a sitcom format, made people laugh, but had a political undertone that didn't overwhelm or preach but did pull a South Park on the viewer.

The issues were complex: Star Wars works and Bush accidentally hits the button. George talks to Ms. Cleo and she says he is in danger - so he bans the NRA and gets a visit from Moses. Pro-life/Pro-Choice - the horror of an abortion that lived versus a woman who says her body is her own. George and Laura's cat is ancient and they decide it is suffering, so they call in Dr. Death to help their cat go out in style.

There are only eight of these episodes and the plotlines are a little more complex than this, but the eight are a must see for anyone that wants a good laugh and doesn't want to be preached to in their political satire. In addition, there are a lot of extras on the disk that are funny and rewarding, making this buy a great buy for fans of Parker and Stone and for those who do not like them as well.
It is something different - this isn't one of their movies, is not South Park, and is even good to go back to when the day is young and you want to remember something better from 2001.",1216771200,6,1877,4.225626740947075

After watching one or two of the episodes, it almost takes the sarcasm out of the entire show, and Bush comes off as almost loveable (which i am sure wasn't intended), Laura Bushs character stays shallow, no surprises on any Parts to add a bit of depth. In parts, the signature writing of the south park team comes through, but in totality, it lacks the sting of borderlevel comedy that trey parker/matt stone have come to prove they have with south park/team america and their earlier full length features (orgazmo, cannibal the musical, etc).

8137412,5,B000H7JCFA,A fantastic series that didn't have enough of an airing. I suspect it was pulled after 9/11 having been made just before that.
