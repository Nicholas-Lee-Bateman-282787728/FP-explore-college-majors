5324980,5,B009GESJ4A,"Daniel Glass made a great joob. The history of the drums set, the relation with some facts of the USA history, the music are things that can make the knowledge about the american culture richer.",1398902400,,194,4.571428571428571
5324981,5,B009GESJ4A,I collect older drums and love this video. If you are interested in the history of drums and drumming you will probably enjoy this too. And Daniel Glass has some nice chops to enjoy watching and hearing.,1398211200,,203,4.513513513513513

5324983,5,B009GESJ4A,"This video spans two information-packed DVDs and covers on the history of US drumming and drum kit evolution. In a way it expands on Disc Two of Steve Smith's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steve-Smith-Drumset-Technique-History-of-the-U-S-Beat/dp/B00007CWI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steve Smith-Drumset Technique/History of the U.S. Beat</a>, which was a more cursory examination of the same material.

What I love about this video is how thoroughly Daniel Glass dug into not only the history of drumming and drum kits, but the social factors. If you've ever watched a Ken Burns documentary then you will have an idea of what I mean. The key difference is Glass does not appear to have any bias or agenda.

The best part of this video is Glass demonstrating playing styles and he does so with period-correct gear and drumming technique. Finding the gear was the easy part. Playing it properly was what impressed me. Hie press rolls are incredibly beautiful as is his brush technique. As the demonstrations progressed through to the British Invasion rock era his technique was updated to reflect that too. I had never heard of Glass before this video, but came away admiring his incredible chops, versatility behind the kit and passion for drums and drumming.

Along the way you are treated to a barrage of information. This  ranges from personalities who were major forces in the evolution of drum kit playing to factors such as why we now end a fill on beat one instead of beat four.

If you do purchase this DVD set and the vintage drums pique your interest you should also get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Traps-The-Incredible-Story-of-Vintage/dp/B009GESIP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Traps: The Incredible Story of Vintage</a>&nbsp;which is devoted to the drums and gear that are featured in this video.",1384819200,7,1899,5.792114695340501
5324984,4,B009GESJ4A,"I enjoyed this DVD, but I hate to say that I was expecting a little something more.  I just thought that there was a lack in production quality to the DVD and that maybe he shouldn't have filmed in front of a live studio audience.  I will admit, Daniel Glass is one snazzy drummer!",1378598400,,281,4.185185185185185
8541190,2,B009GESJ4A,"An interesting video so long as you don't mind some of the author's glaring historical inaccuracies in historical context.  Daniel Glass may know a lot of drumming history, but he's no historian.  Production values are poor and archaic.  The price is much too high for what you get here.  If you're a drumming fanatic, borrow this DVD from a friend.  But don't buy it yourself.  Not at this price.",1522022400,,397,4.681159420289855

8541192,5,B009GESJ4A,Excellent DVD! Daniel Glass made a complete history of the drum set after 12 years of research. Good music and drumming from Mr. Glass. Very educative material.,1497744000,,160,4.962962962962963

8541194,5,B009GESJ4A,"Awesome!  Everything you wanted to know about how the drum kit came about, along with demonstrations of the music along the timeline.  Very interesting and entertaining.  Great balance of history instruction and performance to demonstrate.",1481587200,,239,5.771428571428571
8541195,5,B009GESJ4A,"This would be good for people who aren't only drummers, but interested in music and its history.  Daniel shows in a very fast-paced and engaging way how music has progress from 1865 to 1965 - from the Civil War to the Viet Nam War - from Gettysburg to Liverpool.  A lot happened in that period of time and that includes musically.  Good for students of all ages as well.",1467158400,,370,4.333333333333333
8541196,5,B009GESJ4A,Awesome!! Just great,1464998400,,20,6.0
8541197,5,B009GESJ4A,"Daniel Glass has done a great job of researching, explaining and demonstrating (with a very hot band) popular music styles from 1865 - 1965 (Beatles era). The underlying focus is the history of the drumset - how the kit developed and transformed and affected the playing styles and music. He is obviously passionate about drumming and its history and all of the music, and he does a wonderful job playing these styles himself. It's very inspirational, making me want to practice brushes, ragtime, New Orleans, etc. all over again (with a better understanding now of why those drummers were so innovative and played the way they did). He stops at 1965 because all major drum making innovations of the modern kit, or their concepts, were created by then in some form; what we have today are often improved versions of those designs. Thank you, Daniel for doing this research.

While the DVD shows plenty of clips of Daniel and his band, the majority of time is spent listening to Daniel speak. It's like attending alecture, supplemented with photos, video clips, band performances, etc. There's a lot of information covered over the 2 DVD's; I suspect some people will want less talking and more playing, but truthfully Daniel really does keep it quite concise.

The DVD is well filmed, but don't expect a high defintion blu-ray experience. At $20, I feel there's a lot of bang-for-your-buck.

Daniel also has a companion 2-DVD set called Traps, in which he and guest John Aldridge display and explain drums, cymbals, hardware, etc. from 1865-1965. It's very informative, covering the same era but giving more depth than the Century Project DVD's. There's little playing on this DVD, and it could be tighter editted, quicker moving and fit on 1 DVD. OF the 2 sets, I'd highly recommend The Century Project to any drummer friend you have.

If you like this DVD, I'd also highly recommend Steve Smith's History of the US Beat. Similar idea, but this one came out a few years ago and is very well done. Steve's focus is the drum kit and popular music involving drum kits, therefore all from 20th century and beginning with Ragtime. He only talks briefly and his hot band demonstrates by playing a tune in that style. It's well filmed and delivered. It goes beyond 1965 to more modern styles, such as fusion. There's a lot more playing with the band and a lot less talking on Steve's DVD. Daniel's DVD does a more thorough job of explaining the history and how the kit developed and transformed and affected the playing styles.

Enjoy!",1455408000,,2529,4.791284403669724
8541198,5,B009GESJ4A,"What Mr. Glass accomplishes in The Century Project, is simply amazing.  He correlates the evolution of popular music in the United States from the perspective of a drummer, or better yet, the perspective of the actual drum set itself.  While there are some great books on the musical innovators of playing the drums, (see ""Swing Men"" by Burt Koral), nobody that I know of has presented the forces behind the change in popular music as it relates to the growth of the drum set.

In my opinion what makes this documentary so unique is, it's not just a bunch of sterile history facts presented.  You actually get to hear the change in the music courtesy of demonstrations of each musical styles by not only Mr. Glass himself playing on a period appropriate ""kit"", but selected musicians to accompany him.  This ends up being not only a history lesson in the written/visual sense, but an aural documentation that takes the viewer on a journey of a 100 years of contemporary music.

While this DVD is geared more towards drummers, and people interested in drums, Mr. Glass has also produced a documentary called ""From Ragtime To Rock"" which would probably appeal more to the general music fan.  Considering the quality of production, the enthusiasm for history, and the dedication to preserving said history that Mr. Glass displays, I am sure Ragtime to Rock is of the same caliber as the The Century Project!

Well done Mr. Glass, well done.",1449014400,2,1437,4.7894736842105265
8541199,5,B009GESJ4A,"It appears that this is marketed to drummers.  This is a mistake. The disclaimer here is that I have had drum lessons and have played drums and percussion in public, in front of real people.  However, I found this more interesting because the information given was given in light if the history in which the musical development took place.  Therefore, it is every bit to the person who is interested in music AND history, whether or not he or she has any interest in actually playing any kind of drum.  Mr. Glass demonstrates a capable knowledge of the history in which the music that he has an obvious passion for has evolved.  So I recommend this package to anyone who is interested in American history or music history.  I plan on getting TRAPS as soon as I amass some more points on my Amazon card.",1432252800,2,802,4.496551724137931
