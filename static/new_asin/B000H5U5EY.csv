8136382,3,B000H5U5EY,"Filmed. Low budget, but very interesting how a San Francisco psycho killer gets off.  Where did he go?",1425945600,,102,4.666666666666667
8136383,2,B000H5U5EY,"The city of San Francisco has had a long and distinguished history in the entertainment industry, as the setting for many classics in suspense and crime and genre.  Films like Vertigo, Dirty Harry, Bullitt, and Zodiac, as well as television series like Ironside and McMillian and Wife.  Written and directed by brothers Jose and Eduardo Quiroz, San Franpsycho (2006), which follows the activities of a serial killer, is a rather lamentable addition to this notable group.

The movie's title may be the most creative thing about the film, which opens with the unnamed killer (Jose Rosete) strangling a woman at Treasure Island, and then taking a Polaroid of the victim.  In questioning TV newswoman Rita Franco (Eleni C. Krimitos), police detective Bill Culp (Joe Estevez), discovers that the Killer has been sending her hand written letters about the killings.

Working with his partner Joe Alva (Victor Zaragoza), Culp has few leads.  As the Killer seems to have a fixation on Rita, the investigation centers around the reporter, and those in her life, like her boyfriend Barry (Elias Castillo), and her mother.  Culp assigns officer Eckersley (Todd Bridges) to keep watch over Franco at her home, and because the Killer's notes have a religious slant, a priest (Chris Angelo) is also consulted.  Soon it becomes mostly about Rita, as the Killer gets closer and closer to her.  When in a genius move, Culp decides to provoke the Killer and ""use his own methods against him"", there are some unexpected developments that put a violent close to the case.

While the Quiroz brothers (Death Row, The Damned) deserve some credit for the surprise ending, for the most part, their film is rather dull and plodding, with clichd by the numbers storytelling, and way too many unnecessary scenes.  Listless dialog, wooden acting, and unlikeable characters, may have you checking how long the film has left to run.  Except for a couple of brief scenes of graphic violence, this could probably pass for a made for cable movie.  San Franpsycho might be worth a watch on Amazon's Instant Video, but you may want to think twice before considering a buy.",1334448000,,2137,4.969101123595506
8136384,1,B000H5U5EY,"Bad acting, bad script, bad cinematography, bad acting, bad directing, bad soundtrack, bad acting, bad editing, bad dialogue flow, bad acting and bad acting. I thought for the first ten minutes that it must be a parody. There's nothing to laugh at though. If you and your friends get ripped out of your minds and you like making fun of bad movies you might watch the whole thing. I doubt it though. There's just not enough happening to make fun of besides the horrible script. To be honest and fair I only watched the first 15 minutes straight through. I then watched a few minutes at a time every ten minutes. Truly there are better movies on public access channels.",1319155200,,667,4.566666666666666
8136385,5,B000H5U5EY,"If you love a suspenseful whodunit, get comfortable and rent this thriller!!!

It meets all my criteria for a good horror flick:  the ability for it to be believed (which is what makes me resistant to alot of sci-fi) ; a good back story, something that could stand on its own rubber soles without the horror ; excellent characterization - people that aren't lightweight, but properly filled-in.

And I love the psycho guy!  I wonder if he was fooling around with his buddies, making his ""crazy faces"" and they said - 'hey, dude, seriously - we can make a movie outta this!'

This Jersey girl hopes to see more from these filmmakers!",1299715200,,632,4.607142857142857
8136386,1,B000H5U5EY,"San Franpsycho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. However, your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue.

First, much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliber thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest or an overbearing mother? Certainly, a city the size of San Francisco has a few professional actors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. Clearly, Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper or waitress they ought to be fine tuning.

Joe Rosete as the killer (yes the serial killer is simply known as ""The Killer"") is also pretty awful, in a mentally ill method kind of way, but I am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as his character is written with zero style or personality. A boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie.

In addition, the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an ABC Family movie of the week. There is no nudity or violence to speak of and the R rating clearly is for the adult style pacing. This move meanders like an 85-year-old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on. The only occasional horror comes from lighting Estevez's face with a glare that makes it look like his lower jaw was removed.

I was not expecting a great film when I rented San Franpsycho but I was not expecting mind numbing boredom either.",1258848000,,1743,4.559105431309904
8136387,3,B000H5U5EY,"Does every film have to have a great plot, a well-written script and talented Actors?  I think not.  I have no idea whether Mr. Estevez is planning on any future Acting Lessons, but as long as he maintains that hunk of a body and keeps the macho attitude, I'll watch everything (or should I say, anything) he makes.  I use my imagination frequently while watching his performances and enjoy every inch (oops, did I say inch, I meant to say, ""image"") my mind can produce.

Granted, the entire production could have been better in many ways (i.e.: complete nudity for Mr. Estevez's character whenever possible), but with a copy of this film and a few minutes of privacy, I add a little imagination and it becomes a wide-awake wet dream.

BRAVO!!!",1258848000,,744,4.648854961832061
8136388,1,B000H5U5EY,"Rarely has a movie about a serial killer been so dull and lifeless, and so horribly written and acted.  SANFRANPSYCHO showcases the absurd murders of a religious fanatic who is killing people to cleanse them.  As embodied by muscular non-actor Jose Rosete, this killer is so banal and unbelievable, one can only laugh at his histrionics...especially when he has a 60 second or more scene of masturbating over the heroine's coffee mug.  Joe Estevez continues to demonstrate he didn't get any acting lessons from brother Martin Sheen---he is awful as the police detective assigned to the crime.  There is hardly any action in the movie, and it just plods along to its ridiculous conclusion.  Avoid at all costs.",1163635200,5,709,4.97457627118644
