8473975,5,B005HY1P94,"I loved the movie so I was leery of the series but it was even better because there was more of a great thing.  Great actors, perfectly picked and acted, great writing so very funny, addicting and extremely enjoyable.  I've been waiting a long time to get to see the last few shows as I missed them on tv.  Finally, I was able to find an affordable version of the volume 2 and can't wait to watch them and then watch them again with my daughter.  Absolutely great series with young girls as the strong and smart heroines!",1455840000,,521,4.285714285714286
8473976,5,B005HY1P94,I really enjoyed this series it's a little bit different from the movie but modernised for the new generation to relate to!,1440374400,,123,4.636363636363637
8473977,5,B005HY1P94,I was surprised because they don't always make a good TV series that is based off a movie. They either are so far from the movie you wonder why it can even be considered based off a movie or it is so close to the movie they don't have any surprises or anything new to show. This one was the same concept on characters and storyline as the movie but had new things and surprises to add. I just wish they had kept going with the series. Sad to see it end.,1432857600,,453,3.9347826086956523
8473978,1,B005HY1P94,"My one-star rating is given to the DVD package, not the series itself.  I like the show a lot, and I'm disappointed that it was cancelled so quickly.  I'd give this a 4- or 5-star review if the DVDs were formatted properly.

Whoever is responsible for the two volumes of the DVDs really screwed up.  See my review for Volume One to see the problems with those disks.  Oddly enough, Volume Two has a completely different issue than Volume One does.  The disk package says that the disks are in widescreen format, enhanced for widescreen TVs.  This is the format Volume One is in, and is the format the show on TV was in.  BUT - in fact, the episodes in Volume Two are in full screen (4:3) format.  It is irritating, to say the least, that the 10 episodes in Volume One are formatted differently than the 10 episodes in Volume Two.

To make this more odd and irritating, the extras included in Volume Two are in the proper widescreen format.  So the actual episodes are in the wrong format, and the extras are in the right format.  It might be a little more understandable if the disk package said the shows were in 4:3 format, but it does not.  As I said, the package says the shows are in widescreen format.

Maybe this is why Volume Two is so hard to find; the studio was embarrassed at the error they made, and pulled the package.  Regardless, I wish the studio would re-issue both volumes, and correct the problems with the disks.  This is too good a show to be treated in this manner.",1369008000,4,1488,4.356363636363636
8473979,5,B005HY1P94,"Of course, I like Lindsey Shaw, but special mention should be made for Meaghan Jette Martin.  The two have chemistry together and the series should not have ended so shortly.",1356220800,,174,4.8
