8308774,1,B001HHUE5Q,Sorry folks! Absolutely horrid. It was bad even for something that was supposed to be a parody of a 50's sci-fi film. I would give it zero stars were that possible.,1288224000,,164,4.32258064516129
8308775,4,B001HHUE5Q,"While watching S4 I couldn't help but think of all the black and white horror type movies I grew up with. Even though it was a low budget film, I still found myself to enjoy the comical insight within the story. I thought the talents of these young actors showed as their acting moved fluently and mostly natural. I think these actors have a lot of potential to offer the more they evolve with experience and confidence. I wish the best to all of the actors in their future. I don't think this will be the last time we see these actors and look forward to many more of their projects. Great Job!",1284336000,,595,4.274336283185841
