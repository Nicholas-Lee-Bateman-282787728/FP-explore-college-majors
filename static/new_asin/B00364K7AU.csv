4072152,5,B00364K7AU,"This is the type of movie that after you leave the theatre, you keep thinking about the movie for days.
It meant so much more to know it is a true story!  The acting was excellent and well cast!
Take the whole family.  This movie is a winner!",1259798400,25,242,4.020833333333333
4072153,5,B00364K7AU,"I played Division 1 college ball and knew some basics about the Michael Oher story, so the trailers on TV were enough to make me want to see this movie. But my sister who works in the film industry in Hollywood (and is not a big football fan) said that the reviews were lukewarm - so I was having some doubts based on her assessment. Well, over Thanksgiving weekend we flipped a coin to see Blind Side or 2012 and we ended up watching one of the most moving and uplifting films I think I have ever seen in my life. Hell, I was in tears at one moment and laughing like a hyena the next.

I rarely get to the movies, as I usually wait for the DVD release - and I miss a lot of good stuff because I don't really keep track of what's going on even after they go to DVD (I'm still buying vintage discs after seeing something on TNT or BRAVO that I missed back in the '80s). So take this advice from the ""perpetually uninspired"" - go see this movie and/or buy the DVD when it becomes available. Sandra B. (who I have secretly lusted after for years) gives an absolutely amazing performance. And Quinton Aaron was born for his part. As for Tim McGraw in the role of Sandra's husband, I sheepishly have to admit that - as big a country music fan as I am - I didn't recognize him, and only realized that he was in the movie after hearing about it on the local country station a couple of days after seeing the flick. The boy can actually act!  And his verbal banter with Sandra is nothing short of hysterical.

Go see it if you haven't already done so. As much as I love football movies, the director of Blind Side kept it in perspective and didn't allow the sport to dominate or overshadow the human elements of the story. There were a TON of opportunities for the director to screw-up by diving into Oher's early life, his experiences in college, his mother's drug addiction, etc.  But all of these elements were addressed in just enough detail to keep the movie clean and crisp (pardon my 'theatrical analysis' but you learn a few buzz words when you have a family member ""in the industry""). My sister even walked out of the film remarking that the ""timing"" and ""sequence"" of the storyline was impeccable (whatever that means...). BOTTOMLINE: If you're like me, you'll be on the waiting list for the Blue Ray in the blink of an eye. This is a movie the whole family can rally around!",1259625600,6,2377,4.299107142857143
4072154,5,B00364K7AU,"I go to see movies all the time while they are still in release.

At this time of year we have high profile movie offerings like A Christmas Story, New Moon (same vampires), and the world coming to an end with 2012.  So. it's easy for this movie to get lost in the shuffle.

It would have been so easy to miss this movie, and such a mistake to do so.  For, this is one of the best movies of the year, and one of the few I recommend whole heartedly.

Sandra Bullock gives probably the best performance of her career, playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, a tough business like mom, who sees big Mike, a young oversized kid who never had a role model, and who never did well academically, because he had no reason to believe in himself.  He is the underdog we love to root for.

The Tuohys take him in to their plush house, and we get drawn into the experience, perhaps sucked into this story might be a more apt description.  Yet Mike has a hidden gift which others like the sports coach can identify, and other teachers start to have faith in him, so who knows what will happen.

If you're like me it's a movie about the importance of a mentor and believing in people, the more you believe in them the more they start to believe in themselves. If you like this one, I also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akeelah-and-the-Bee/dp/B000G1R38U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akeelah and the Bee</a>, another five star movie.  In its first 14 days The Blind Side has done over $108 million at the box office, assuring that it will be one of the big hits of the year.

While the Academy does not typically reward comedies with awards, Sandra Bullock may get a nomination, and so might the writers for best adapted screenplay, and she might win a Golden Globe  for her performance.

A point of interest in the movie is Lily Collins daughter of Phil Collins who plays Sandra Bullock's daughter.

Update, Jan 29, 2010. As she has now won the Golden Globe, which is a dress rehearsal for the Oscars, I expect she will get the Oscar nomination, and it sets the stage for an interesting contest with Meryl Streep for her performance in Julie and Julia. Both actresses played real life characters, with an interesting mix of drama and humor.  Although Oscars are not usually given for this type of performance, the exception is Marisa Tomei in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Cousin-Vinny/dp/B000SFOW8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Cousin Vinny</a>.  I predict this will be the year of the exception.  Streep has been nominated 15 times winning only twice.  This would be Bullocks first nomination.

Update 2/3/2010. The Blind Side has been nominated for 2 Academy Awards, for Best Actress, and Best Picture. As of 2010 the Best Picture category has been expanded from 5 to 10 pictures, partly because of falling ratings, and partly because many popular movies have not historically received the same level of Oscar love, as movies such as The Blind Side has received from the public.

Blind Side has grossed over $238 million dollars domestically, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of 2009, and no 63 all time for domestic box office, and it's still in release.

I hope this was helpful to you, and I think you will enjoy the movie.",1259625600,143,3310,4.896057347670251

4072157,5,B00364K7AU,This movie is just incredible!  I went in with high expectations and they were exceeded....a rare feat indeed.  The story is both inspirational and funny; definately a movie for the entire family.

4072158,5,B00364K7AU,"Sandra Bullock portrays this role with an excellent touch.  When she has to be a smart #ss, she doesn't hold back and demonstrates sufficient confidence in her own beliefs that she comes off perfectly!  This is not the comedienne, this is a confident, talented woman with a heart (the character she plays) and in playing this role with honesty, she makes the audience laugh, applaud, cheer, and cry at different times.

Tim McGraw performed perfectly as her loving, intelligent, compassionate husband who recognized that he was married to a unique jewel.

Quinton Aaron plays a wonderful, mysterious, quiet young man who can 'speak' with just a small gesture of his face.  We have a wonderful new actor on the scene now!  His acting reminded me of the sensitivity and excellence of Rob Brown (Finding Forrester, Coach Carter and The Express.)

I plan to own this as soon as its out on DVD.  The sweetness, humanity and poignancy in this movie reminds me of ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  The night I saw it at a theater in Mississippi, the theater sold out and many of the people around me said they had driven there from towns almost 100 miles away because those theaters were sold out too.  This movie opened the same night as that New Moon thing; I was proud that people packed the theater to see The Blind Side!  This film is bound to receive at least 1 or 2 Academy Award nominations and become a classic about family relationships, compassion, and love.  Go see it!  I believe you'll want to see it again and again!  Thanks, Sandra!!!",1258675200,5,1535,4.657992565055762

4072192,1,B00364K7AU,"Patronizing, white savior complex trope. Makes white people feel good about themselves, so that's why it's popular.  Mike Oher's character lacks personality/ we don't get to know him. Pushed into a sport he wasn't even fully interested in to benefit his adoptive, football-obsessed family. So because he's a big Black guy, that's the only thing he should do? How about finding out what he actually likes as a person. Makes him seem like he only does it to ""pay"" back his new family for being oh so generous. Thought they were supposed to be selfless. He is portrayed as an ""acceptable"" minority, which apparently means being devoid of a personal life and personality and just being polite/simple so as not to make others (read: white people) scared.

4072216,5,B00364K7AU,"The Blind Side deals with different aspects of the family: it shows the importance and the implication of legal ties in a family, as well as the love that a family needs to have for one another. During the process of being legally adopted by the Tuohy family, Michael said he thought he already was a part of the family. This shows that not all families have to be defined by legal ties, but can be based off of a mutual love and meeting relational and functional needs. When Michael was legally adopted and he committed to Ole Miss, there was an investigation done into the Tuohy family to discover whether or not they were trying to exploit a young man for their own gain - what the interviews reinforced was that Michael chose Ole Miss because he wanted to, and that the Tuohys truly loved Michael and that Michael loved his new family.",1512691200,,839,4.454545454545454

They didn't care that he was black and they were white. Leigh Anne looked at him first as a child in need, then as her son. This family was constructed by a connection with someone. This is why its so hard to define family because anyone can become your family just as in this case. Family is not always determined by being biologically related. This movie does a great job with portraying a family that isn't normal. For centuries a family meant a mother, a father, and their biological children. But this has changed the entire dynamic of what a family looks like. Its more realistic to what current families look like. There are more adopted children, more blended families, and more same sex families. This movie is a gateway to accepting families that are more diverse and not the socially constructed normal family.",1512604800,,1114,4.6313131313131315

It's a movie that really tugs at your heart strings. The real Michael Oher says that it didn't exactly happen like it does in the film, but that's what happens in all book to movie stories. And that's why they always say, based on a true story and not, this IS the true story. Sandra Bullock was absolutely amazing in this film. For a minute, you forgot it was Sandra Bullock. She embraced her character with gusto and took it to another level. I really do love the cast. Kathy Bates is my girl! And I keep forgetting that Tim McGraw can act. I just remember him as being this young wild Mustang that stole my cousin's horse at a concert and got ticketed for it. But he has really impressed me. (You gotta thank Faith for that one) Lily Collins is wonderful in this film. I love the kid who played SJ, so funny. It was great seeing all the actual college coaches participate in this film too!

4072269,1,B00364K7AU,"All I knew going into this movie was that Sandra Bullock was in it, she won an Oscar for her part, and it was based on a book by Michael Lewis. And I had a vague sense of the story--that it was about a real Southern family who takes in a young African American man and some mutual lesson learning takes place. So I was expecting something where afterwards you'd think, ""Yeah, that was ok, but Sandra Bullock was amazing!"" What I actually saw was a Hallmark TV movie with buffoonish performances, about a family of crudely drawn Southern narcissists who take in a neutered, black saint and prove the adage that some white people are so evolved they can spot a member of the endangered non-threatening, non-sexual, secretly sweet black race and allowing him to blossom by placing him in the rarefied air of a ""good environment""--and Sandra Bullock was still pretty good.
I know this was based on a real story, and the plot isn't what makes this movie so awful, it's the way that it's done. There is a poisonous sensibility at work here, a view of the white family through a ""good humored"" lens that not only flatters them for being liberal, magnanimous people, but then doubly flatters them for showing that they know they're not perfect--I mean, sometimes they watch TV instead of sitting at the dining room table with each other!--, but garsh darn it, they're set to do the best they know how. But a sweet natured recognition that you're not quite perfect is a sneaky movie way of saying that someone is, in fact, better than perfect; so the conflict in this story is essentially that when a perfect white family cherry picks a (secretly) perfect black teen who the other local whites have myopically written off because the system failed him, they have to make the rest of the world catch up with what they know: this kid's really got the goods. And with persistence, love and some mild obstacle-overcoming, the rest of the world does eventually catch up with the family and realize that this sexless, benign, never-difficult, preternaturally appreciative, obsessively gentle, grudge avoiding, impervious-to-trauma black teen deserves a future! Every second of watching this scolding treacle play out was nauseating. This is worse than overt racism. It's a condescending racism wrapping itself in political correctness that offers the faux insight that if you always judge a book by the cover you could miss the occasional exception to every racial cliche that this movie supposes to be true the other 99% of the time.
Saddest of all is, at the end of the film, that when you see photos of the actual people this movie is based on, they seem like good, interesting people. There is a normal humanity in their faces that the director of this movie somehow replaced with smug wisdom in the case of the white actors and a lobotomized, Mr. Snuffleupagus quality with the actor who plays Michael. Honestly, it creeped me out.",1496534400,8,2921,4.763313609467455

4072348,5,B00364K7AU,"Perhaps the reason we don't have more films made about truly great stories -- is because there are not enough people living truly self-less, loving lives. This film, based on a true story, is a GREAT film, because the family that welcomed into their home and adopted a ""kid from the streets"" -- met that challenge -- with love.

That being said -- it is worthy to note that there were many people along the way that helped Michael Oher find his way to the Tuohy's home. There was the mechanic, Big Tony, who introduced Big Mike to the private school the Tuohy's sent their other 2 children. Plus there was ""Coach Cotton"" who effectively worked a ""guilt trip"" on the school's admissions team to get Michael Oher into the private school as a student. Without those initial actions, Michael Oher would have never meet the Tuohy's. Meaning: The Tuohy's weren't out on the streets of Memphis looking for a kid living on the streets to adopt. Somehow, someway, their fates, their karma brought them together.

True acts of kindness and compassion -- as depicted in this film -- are rare and precious -- and our hearts long to feel and experience these kinds of emotions -- because that level of true love is deeply longed for in all of us.

I applaud this film for giving us all the opportunity to connect with that most precious part of ourselves. Bravo!",1482796800,10,1349,4.589211618257261

4072355,5,B00364K7AU,"The Blind Side
  Michael's gift is that the Good Lord gave him the ability to forget. He's mad at no one and doesn't really care what happened. His story might be sad, but he's not sad(Lewis 89). The story of Michael Oher is one that would have almost come from a fairy tale or Disney movie. A young boy grows up in a poverty stricken town and is homeless or in foster care for most of his life. Yet he is not as helpless as he seems. Standing at six foot five inches and weighing in at just around three-hundred pounds, Michael is anything but just a normal boy from the projects. The story starts off and maintains a rhythm of tension between Michael and everyone who tries to help him. In the middle of the story we have an encouraging narrative of a young boy who has nothing in his life but his athletic ability, due to his previous displacement and hardship. This goodness of people theme is seen a lot during the book and is carried on through the actions of the Tuohy family and their supporters. He only takes up football and school, after a rich white family plucks him from the streets and makes him part of their family in a spontaneous series of events that lead to them adopting him. When you look at the odd predicament that Michael is in there must be many elements to look at. He is the son of a crack-addicted mother and a murdered father, was incredibly shy, and his high school GPA was 0.6. He was just another homeless black teenager with a bleak future that could only get worse if it wasn't for his athletic talent. The only reason that Michael was able to  keep living was because of the compassion of a few people and the realization they had that Michael was truly special.",1481673600,,1699,4.336477987421383

4072361,5,B00364K7AU,"This heartfelt movie portrayed many family themes. One of the most interesting them was child socialization. This was the most interesting because Michael went through many hard situations as a child that made him socially unordinary.  He bounce around from foster home to foster home viewing many different social norms in each place he went.  In the end Michael was able to build great social bonds with a two new family, Leigh Anne's family and his football team.",1481155200,,466,4.961538461538462
4072362,5,B00364K7AU,"The Blind Side is the perfect example of an interpersonal drama that is depicted through the life of Michael Oher, a kid that was raised in the projects by his drug addict mother and who went on to become adopted from a wealthy family, the Tuohy's. This movie shows a great connection with race and family as Michael makes the Tuohy into an interracial family which often gets a lot of criticism from society. Although Michael was different, The Blind Side challenged the views of the white upper class and depicted it through the scenarios shown in the film such as Leigh Ann while she is out to eat with her friends and they criticize her for wanting to adopt Michael. It shows a great stigma that an African American boy is always up to no good and therefore should not be a part of the upper class like those in the movie. However, the character of Leigh Ann expresses how Michael has come into her life and has changed her life more than she has changed his. The Blind Side shows a transformation of Michael Oher who was known as simply another African American from the projects into a successful NFL football player with the help of his new family.",1481068800,,1155,4.478672985781991

4072371,5,B00364K7AU,"""The Blind Side"" provides us with an example as to how one can be brought up from a very unstable and unhealthy home environment to making a complete success out of himself. Along with the help of a family of complete strangers Michael Oher was able to make an NFL star out of himself. After being ripped from his home as a young child and living on the streets for the majority of his teenage life, Michael lucked into the Tuohy family. They took him under their wing and provided him with all the functions of the family. They treated him as their own son and gave him the necessities needed to survive and thrive in the world. The mother took the time to get to know Michael and nurture him to get him to trust her and the family. That is a major point of the family, nurturing. Because this family came along and helped him on his path he became what he was destined to be. Without the knowledge of what its like to have a family Michael most likely would've ended up like a lot of the other African American orphans that were shown in the video, homeless or dead. This film shows society how important it is to have a family and how much of a difference it came make in a persons life.",1480118400,,1190,4.223684210526316

Leigh took it upon herself to help Michael as she provided for him a place to sleep, eat, the ability to graduate high school and go to college. Leigh did not care about race, or where Michael came from she saw potential in him and so she pushed him to be a better person. She saw him and treated him as a son. Leigh's family also accepted Michael into the family even when Leigh asked Michael if he wanted to legally be adopted into the family.

The movie kept my attention though and well. It moved along quickly and pulled me into the story and left me feeling inspired. I wasn't excited to see a blonde sandy bullock in a sports movie, I think that's what might have turned me off the most, but she did really good job! It's rare to see a movie where there's a really strong lead female character. Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end, she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. The youngest son did an amazing job! So much talent in him. The character of Mike I think could have used a few more lines, even if he's supposed to be shy and reserved. All the actors really did a great job though for the most part. No it's not an epic Oscar winning film, although I wouldn't be surprised if Bullock got nominated for something for her acting. It is NOT loaded with propaganda as the other reviews might suggest.

4072481,3,B00364K7AU,"The beginning is stultifying. Later parts of the movie less so. The movie is saved by the endearing Bullock and the little boy. The husband and coaches are strong in supporting roles. The purported star...the giant-sized low-intelligence football player, is boring at the start, but eventually is bearable as his personality emerges. This movie would be unbearingly long and slow, but is saved by Bullock and several other characters.

FRAUD WARNING: It is listed as 128 minutes. ACTUAL length is about TWICE that. Stock up on popcorn and coffee to stay awake.",1469491200,,560,5.086956521739131

I would recommend this movie for anyone - even if you are not a football fan (I am not). I just love Amazon.  Before Amazon, everything I needed would have generated a trip to a different store.  Now, if I need something  just about anything, I go and look at Amazon first. Its amazing that I can buy everything from cereal, dog food, nail products, clothing, household items and electronics.  For instance, buying this movie is just another example of the wonder that is Amazon.  I have been very impressed with the huuuge selection on Amazon.  I don't think there is anything that you cant buy on Amazon, short of perishable foods.  Most of the time you can the items cheaper than you can in the local store, but not always. Then we have the additional spectacular invention that is Amazon prime.  This praise and rant doesnt mean that I think Amazon is perfect, and I have had a few problems here and there, but over all  Amazon is my go to place for everything I need to buy, except groceries.  Thank you Amazon for being around, once again. I just absolutely love purchasing from Amazon.",1468972800,5,1221,4.46606334841629

What would the homeless Big Mike do in a huge house where she lives with her husband and two kids? And how come, once he's inside, he's changing her life more than she is his?

The Blind Side (trailer) is a pretty amazing movie full of serious topics: family relationships, academics, living in the slums, and reaching the poorer. It's about the change one can make on another's life. How when one tries to bless someone else, he gets blessed in return, more than he ever thought possible. It's a story that's not sugar-coated, but brings amazing hope and inspiration.",1468886400,,700,4.6

4072840,5,B00364K7AU,"A lot of people out there might pass on this, seeing as this is a movie about sports and they would be cheating themselves of an absolutely wonderful experience. This is one of my favorit movies of all times and anyone taking my advice on watching this movie, can always thank me later.

Yes this is a movie about sports, but it is also a heartwarming and - at times - gut wrenching tale of human relations, poverty and escaping a miserable life to fulfill what ever promise one might carry within. And on top of that, it's a true story: The story of Michael - Big Mike - Oher, who in a stunning turn of events rose from the projects to become offensive tackle with the Baltimore Ravens.

Big Mike is a troubled young black man, more or less living on the streets of Memphis, when he comes to the attention of coach Bert Cotton at the christian highschool Wingate, who sponsors his admission to the school, hoping Michael will become a star footballer. The admission to Wingate doesn't really change Michael's life though. He doesn't really fit in at Wingate and his is still living on the streets, but then one night Michael encounters the Touhy's: Leigh Anne, her husbond Sean and children S.J. and Collins and over night life changes - for all of them. Michael finds the home, he never had and the Touhy's a new and beloved son and brother.

Soon Michael starts to blossom, both at home, in school - and on the football field. His grades that were apauling also starts to pick up and soon universities are cuing up with offers of scholarships, just to ensure his services in their football programmes. Michael becomes an honor student of Ol' Miss and goes on to be drafted by the Ravens.

This is a beautiful story, told with a great deal of humor and littered with great performances, not the least from Sandra Bullock, who won both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for her part as Leigh Anne. Deservedly so I might add. This is - without question - the finest performance of Sandra Bullock, I have ever seen.

I said you could thank me later. It's later Bert.",1448236800,,2067,4.472148541114058

4072855,3,B00364K7AU,"Maybe I need another viewing but what should have been a parallel story of the maturation of a do gooder Dixie gal and a inner city child of underpriviledge and family trauma becomes a Women Rule vehicle for Sandra Bullock. She is an expert at almost everything, laying ouit a Thanksgiving spread in 11 seconds while keeping an eye on the Football game; and balances Motherhood with Wifehood and now protector of lost Black kids.

""The Black kid"" is supposed to be...17?...he looks 27...and his best buddy is Mrs. Tuohy's son, who looks about 9. I dunno....

The real big chance both the Director and Writer missed, was in exposing our little do gooder as ultimately a self serving socialite, who never once asks this young man if he really is *interested* in football. As I said above, they seem more interested in the glorification of the modern feminist.",1447545600,,857,4.74496644295302

Very strong performances by all, particularly the little kid, Jason Jr., A bit too Hollywoody in places but a great family movie that inspires you to do better.

4072982,5,B00364K7AU,".'Sandra Bullock' wins, some would say an overdue 'oscar' for her performance in this 'really good movie'
I did actually feel that 'Quinton Aaron's role as 'Michael Oher' was an amazing portrayel was well worthy of the
award he received and the nominations in various categories at that time.

There is no question that 'Sandra Bullock' a genuine talent, and yet. not all her 'role' choices have done her justice.
In recent times i re-watched and enjoyed 'The Proposal' ( couldn't stop laughing ) on the strength of her role in that film i bought and watched 'All about Steve' back then and was hugely dissapointed, it was a real 'turkey'
This film is based on a true story -
In this film 'Leigh' ( sandra bullock ) takes pity on 'Michael' ( Quinton aaron ) when she see's him wandering the street with nowhere to go and without asking her family invites him into her home for the night.
'Michael' had recently been given a place in a local school after a 'coach' at the school had seen him sink several balls into the basketball net, the 'coach' see's potential.
'Leigh' and her family quickly take 'Michael' into their hearts ignoring the racial jibes.
They set out not only to be-friend 'Mchael'' they set out to help him become all that he can be, both with his education and obvious flare for sport.
This is far and away one of the best movies I had seen in 2010, should 'Sandra Bullock' have won 'best actress' ? ?.. it was certainly a great performance from her.
In my view the film itself was almost certainly worthy of both acclaim and probably should have won 'Best Film' of that year.
The film is certainly worth a re-visit.......enjoyed it as much this time as I had first time around.",1435536000,,1697,4.527687296416938

How/why that was not dealt with is beyond me. SB has way too much talent to waste ones attention on boobs & butt.  .  She was trying to set an example...by behavior?  Look at your clothes, lady...be a lady.

4073062,5,B00364K7AU,"Dear Amazon person in charge for this reviewing thing,

I don't want to be too much critical. But honestly, I wanted to say that grading people for their own opinions about an actor movie was not ethical.  You are not their teacher, and you didn't give them anything to study beforehand  for a quiz or a test or a final or a final presentation in front of the class.  And they are not your students. Come on; guys!  That attitude of yours will push them away.  They would not have the envy to comment on those actors in this society on your webpage.  That can decrease your sale.  Please, you can stop that grading score approach as of today: 5/7/15.  Let's make it  ""fun"" instead.  Offer peace of mind to the public.  Thank you.
P.S. Too much competition does tear us apart.  It causes hate, anger, stress, diseases, even death- for what?

Dear Sandra, (Allow me to call you: ""Sandy"")

How are you doing, gal?  How much do I owe you for this film? I watch it every day. You make me smile and laugh. You create a positive impact in my life.  Words are not enough for me, to explain my compliments and congratulations to you, for what you've done toward me.  What I owe you is: gratitude, recognition, and respect.

You earned 60,000 bonus points to heaven, the fact that I watch it daily. God likes to see when we are helping with each other. As I'm special to him, this is why you got so many points. Because you are making a difference in a disabled life.  You taught us a lot; didn't you? They are: Sociology, Religion, Philosophy, and Nutrition.  We saw boiled eggs"" only at your thanksgiving dinner table.  You wanted to tell us something.  That food is so nutritional, as it maintains our cardiovascular system. It is a good source of Vitamin K.  It is very beneficial for our bone health! But, we don't eat it much.  Why? I don't know.  I will add this: ""after removing the shell from the egg, cut it in 2 halves. Put a teaspoon of peanut butter in each half. Then, eat it "".

Dear Oscar Members of Directors,

How are you doing today?  Good I hope! If you already gave Sandra an Oscar for that film, Im writing to request a second or a Golden Globe award for her and casting staff.  They deserve it.  Consider it like a delayed reward. That exists in life.

She was an Activist, an Advocate, a Benefactor, a Good Samaritan, a Nutritionist, a gorgeous wife who doesnt nag, and a lovable housewife. What you saw  in this motion picture was pure evidence of a love-filled home.

What I liked to hear her say was when she expressed herself in this sublime statement to her husband whos driving the car under the rain: Turn around (She had a mission and a plan, making her husband curious), and when she said to her son SJ Make room for Michael.  His size or his race or his financial status didn't matter. That was a life lesson. You know the rest: dressing, feeding, etc.

As a Historian and fan of former US President Abraham Lincoln, she wanted to remind us to try a little common sense, to practice his philosophy of life dated in the 18th century:  The best approach to reduce poverty is to provide to the less fortunate an equal chance.

Gil Netter, John Lee Hancock, Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, Quinton Aaron, Kathy Bates (Miss Sue), Collins, S.J, and staff: Way to go; guys!  Thank you very much.

Dear Reader:  I strongly recommend you to purchase this DVD now. Don't wait until tomorrow. Why, you may ask?  I don't want you to miss it. I know that it will inspire your family and you.  It will take you just less than one minute to buy: ""The Blind Side"" at www.amazon.com with a credit card.  It is not only about Touch - Down"" at an American football game. Sandra Bullock went deeper than that.  It is a Health-Guide.  It is a lifes lesson. You must pay attention to her behavior.  I love it.  What did you say?  Absolutely, you can buy several.  Grab them all for your family members.  You could send some to your friend's. Richard Bousseau; 5/7/15",1430870400,2,3964,4.398620689655172

4073081,5,B00364K7AU,"The only reason The Blind Side was really even on my radar was my roommate.  He's a big football fan (and that's an understatement), so he was naturally interested.  I decided it sounded good, but we just never got around to seeing it.  He saw it over Christmas, and I still was dragging my heels.  Finally, I went to see it tonight.  I should have gone weeks ago.

Inspired by a true story, the movie focuses on Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron).  Michael is a black high schooler living on the wrong side of Memphis.  He manages to get into a private Christians school on the good side of town, but his grades are so poor he might not be able to stay.  And he has no home life - in fact, he's homeless.

While attending the school, Michael catches the attention of the white Tuohy family.  As they observe him for a couple of months, they are drawn to him.  Finally, one night near Thanksgiving, Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) invites him to spend the night.  As one night turns into more, the unlikely family grows closer together.  Will the Tuohy's be able to give Michael a chance at something great?  How will Michael change the family?

Not being a football fan myself, I don't know much about the real Michael Oher.  Even so, I knew where the story was going right from the start.  I mean, really, have you ever seen an inspired by a true story movie that ended sadly?  I didn't think so.

But does that mean I was bored?  Not on your life.  Michael is established as a likable and sympathetic young man right from the start.  And the Tuohys were nice as well.  Because of this, I was pulled into the story and wanted to see how things would turn out.

From the little I did know, I wasn't sure how much I would like Leigh Anne.  Sometimes, headstrong characters work, and something they annoy me.  Here, it worked beautifully.  Yes, Leigh Anne is stubborn, but she's the kind of woman I'd want on my side.  She's tough and loyal, always doing what she thinks is best for those she loves.  A couple of times she acts without thinking, but then again, who doesn't?

Michael also shows that loyalty to those he cares about.  Frankly, the movie does a good job of developing his character.  When it starts out, we aren't sure how smart he really is.  As it progresses, it shows us the how and the why of his learning problems.  No, he isn't stupid, but learning doesn't come easily to him.

The movie is pretty much the story of Michael and Leigh Anne.  The rest of the family is certainly present, and we see how they change for the better as a result of Michael entering the family.  But they aren't the main focus.

The acting is superb.  I've got to admit, Sandra Bullock's accent doesn't seem quite right to me, but I can't quite place why.  That is my only complaint with the acting.  The movie calls for some tender moments, intense moments, and some comedy mixed in as well.  And the cast pulls it off.  Tim McGraw plays Sean Tuohy.  I've never associated him with his acting, but he plays this part perfectly.  The actors who play the two Tuohy kids are also great, especially Jae Head who steals many scenes as S.J.  And of course Quinton Aaron is outstanding as Michael.  He nailed the character and the changes he goes through.

I was actually surprised at the amount of comedy in the film.  Yes, it's a drama.  But there are quite a few scenes that had me and the audience I saw it with laughing.

Ultimately, it is a drama about the power we can have on those around us for good.  I was moved so many times watching it.  It's the kind of movie that makes you stop and think about who you might be overlooking that you can help in your own life.  And that's always a good thing.

My only real gripe is that I didn't go see this movie as soon as it came out.  The Blind Side is a great reminder that we are called to help all those around us, and will leave you with a smile on your face.",1430265600,2,3897,4.297931034482759
4073082,5,B00364K7AU,"The Blind Side is one of my favorite movies. Besides the fact that it is based on a true story, the acting is phenomenal. I always enjoy seeing movies starring Sandra Bullock and she played her part so well. I also developed more of an appreciation for Tim McGraw, who not only can sing but he can act. Michael Oher's story is heartwarming and shows just how much someone can achieve if they are given faith, hope, and love. Be ready to grab some tissues but you won't regret watching this movie.

4073136,5,B00364K7AU,"Whether you're watching it alone or with your family, The Blind Side is the perfect feel-good movie. The film is based on the true story of Michael Ohres transformation from homeless to star athlete. Michael is taken in by the Touhy family and treated as one of them almost immediately. The film focuses on the relationships that characters develop, and how these relationships change the characters.
 The character progression throughout the movie creates a sense of personality, allowing you to be empathetic towards them and therefore pull you more into the story. The variation of ages and personalities makes the film appealing to everyone in the family because it is easy to identify with one or multiple characters in The Blind Side. The movie portrays the struggles of this unusual family in a comedic yet touching way, leaving you feeling uplifted. The movie does a really great job of reflecting the feelings the real Touhy family experienced during the early days of Michael Ohres football career and life as part of their family.
 Watching the movie alone brings back the best feelings of growing up in a happy family, and makes you appreciate the things you had on an everyday basis that others were not fortunate enough to have. Aside from bringing back memories, the Touhy family is an inspiration through their love and compassion for Michael. Michael returns the feelings in his own subtle ways that prove how grateful he is to his family.
 Watching this movie is guaranteed to uplift and inspire all ages. It is one of those movies you can watch anytime and still love the way it makes you feel. Overall, The Blind Side is a great movie that manages to evoke feelings that lead to laughing, crying, and everything in between.",1428019200,,1743,4.861952861952862
4073137,5,B00364K7AU,"The Blind Side is, according to IMDb, is the story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family (IMDb). The caring woman, Leigh Anne Tuohy, discovers Michael walking through a rainstorm and asks her husband to stop the car. She walks over to Michael and offers him a place to stay. A reluctant Big Mike, as the family came to name him, gets into the car and accepts the place to stay. He eventually becomes a part of the family. As a viewer of the movie we learn much about Michaels struggle. He has moved around his whole life, has multiple siblings, and does not know his father. Because of his troubled past, Michael has never made school a priority, or even had the chance to go to school much. He is very far behind and struggles with things such as basic math and reading. With the help of dedicated and caring teachers, his new loving, adoptive family, and faith, Michael becomes an honor roll student. Eventually, Michael goes out for the football team. Him and his teammates find that he is actually really good. Michael finds himself in a good, happy place. He goes on to join the NFL and continues to live a good life today. I believe this movie is touching in more ways than one. The dedication of Michaels teacher and family showed that you really can make a difference in someones life and give him or her a life they never would have had. This movie gives me faith in teaching and gives me motivation to get to know my students and also give them all the attention they may need. I recommend this movie to any aspiring teacher as it teaches good lessons and gives good advice on how to connect and live through your students. Teaching really does make a difference.",1427846400,,1804,4.453172205438066
4073138,5,B00364K7AU,"The Blind Side, directed by John Lee Hancock, inspired many people through the true story of Michael Oher. Oher lived his whole life in poverty and homelessness. Then in an extraordinary turn of events the Tuohys, a rich white family from Nashville, Tennessee, take him into their massive home and Michael Oher joins the family. Michael then achieves greatness in football through the position of left tackle. The movie began with a play-by-play account narrated by Leigh Anne Tuohy of a professional football game in which a legendary quarterback was injured. The defensive lineman, Lawrence Taylor, tackled the quarterback in his blind side. The left tackle position then became much more valued because the quarterback needs someone to protect their blind side. This tied into the story because huge, tall Michael Oher had extreme protective instincts. The Tuohy family helped Michael achieve his potential both athletically and academically by showing him unconditional love and never failing support.  Oher accepts a scholarship to play at Ole Miss and became one of the nation's best blind side protectors.  His abilities earned him a spot in the first round of the NFL Draft where he was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens.  This is a great recommendation to any sports lover or those who love a great happy story.",1427760000,,1318,5.120930232558139

4073140,5,B00364K7AU,"The Blind Side is about a boy, Michael, who is a ward of the state that gets into a private school because of his possible athletic talent.  One night Leigh Anne finds him walking in the rain and she houses him for the night.  She takes a liking to this mysterious boy and shelters, feeds, and clothes him.  Even though he was doing extremely poor academically he eventually gets his grades up enough to take up football.  With some help he learns how to play the game and becomes the best one on the team.  Leigh Anne eventually adopts Michael and she helps him get his GPA up so that he can go to college on a football scholarship.  When he picks Ole Miss as his college of choice an investigation arises.  Michael soon realizes that Leigh Anne and her family are now his family.  He states that hes going to this school because then he would be attending his familys school.  There are many good ideas that the teachers, coach, and Leigh Anne all portrayed in the movie.  One teacher saw that he wasn't stupid when they tried an oral test, which proved he did listen in class, but he had a hard time reading and learning.  Other teachers soon follow suit and they spend one-on-one time during this time.  Another teacher makes Michael work for his grade and doesnt just give it too him because he needs to get the grade.  The coach in the first game stood up for Michael, which made Michael realize that hes trying to protect him and that he cares.  Leigh Anne is a wonderful character throughout the movie.  She pushes Michael to open up and is persistent with him. She gets criticism for helping him, but she doesnt care and that all that matters is him.  There are a few aspects of the adults in Michaels life that I disagree with.  First off I don't like how the only reason why he got into school was because the coach pushed for it to happen because of his athleticism.  Also all but one teacher believes it is pointless for them to teach Michael because he doesnt do tests.  Some of the things I don't like about the coach are that on the first day of practice he is using terms that Michael doesnt know what they mean and isn't taking the correct amount of time to show him.  He also teaches Michael some bad lessons when playing football, which one shouldnt teach because they are illegal when playing.  Leigh Anne even has a few bad spots by trying to get him to focus on school and get his grades up so he can go to college to play football, preferably their families college, but she never asks him where he wants to go or what he wants to do with his future.  I extremely recommend this movie to all teachers and future teachers.  It was a great movie that captures you the entire way.",1427673600,,2701,4.347305389221557

The biggest problem I had was never getting the movie back after I had loaned it out. In 90% of the classes the presentation had a lasting impact, many did not believe it was based on a real life story, till research proved other wise.",1426723200,,498,4.423913043478261

4073232,5,B00364K7AU,"I admit it. I'm a sucker for ""underdog struggles against tough odds and wins"" movies. And that is just what this is, to me. Michael Oher is a kid dealt a tough hand, and all he needs is a chance. The Tuohy's, a rich white family from Tennessee, give him just that chance. Lee Ann Tuohy is an interior decorator, known for her good tastes and style. When they see Michael walking by himself at night because he can't sleep in the laundramat, Lee Ann's son TJ recognizes him as a kid from school. They take him home and have him sleep on the couch, and later have him move in with them. It is tough for Michael, know as ""Big Mike"" because of his huge size, to try to make it scholastically in the school when he is so far behind. Everyone assumes Michael will excel in football, because he is so big. But, he has a kind heart and isn't agressive enough. Lee Ann remembers that he scored 98% in ""protective instincts,"" and helps the coach learn the key to getting Michael to develope as a football player.

The Tuohy's officially adopt Michael and Lee Ann bonds with Michael and becomes his mother. She shows her own protective instincts later when she stands up to a drug dealer who is threatening Michael. The tenderest relationship, however, is the bond that forms between Michael and his new little brother TJ, who makes the movie fun and delightful to watch.

Michael shines as a football player, but is still scholastically challenged. The Tuohy's hire Miss Sue to tutor him, so he can get a football scholarship to a good school. He finally gets his GPA up and is being courted by over 20 schools. He decides the Tuohy's alma matter Ole Miss, and then then is challenged by the College sports authorities who wonder if the reason the Tuohy's adopted an atheletic black man was to funnel him to their alma matter, Ole Miss. This was all straightened out later, and Michael did go to Ole Miss.

This is a story of people sharing their home, thir posessions and their lives for nothing other than love's sake.

Five Stars!",1424908800,,2023,4.4742547425474255

This is a story about living the talk, helping those we can when we have the means, something that not many of us don't do. As a bible believing Christian I was challenged to get out of my comfort zone and try and do something for somebody in a challenging situation. We may not have the wealth to pull a stunt like this one in the movie, but there are many people around us who are in need of different things. We just need to identify those needs and the people that need our help.

Overall this is a very nice movie and I give it 5 stars. And kudos to Sandra Bullock, I loved her character.",1424304000,,679,4.067164179104478

4073325,2,B00364K7AU,"This is NOT the whole movie.  Several scenes have been cut -- scenes that added to the overall charm of the movie (in its uncut version).  Missing:  Scene early in the movie, in which Sandra Bullock's husband (Tim McGraw?) notices Big Mike not eating, and tells the school to give Michael a food card and put it on his bill.  Missing:  Scene in which Michael's primary advocate teacher sits him down in a side room and walks through the test / homework with him verbally.  I'd swear there was another coach cut from the door during the recruitment scenes.  There may be other scenes and seconds here and there missing that I don't recall.

I really like the movie, and this is one of my favorite roles from Sandra Bullock.  But this version is incomplete, and it is not faithful to the whole movie as it was meant to be.",1421020800,2,820,4.413333333333333

You don't have to know about football to enjoy this movie. There is so much more to this film besides football. Sandra Bullock's character is astounding and very powerful.

4073849,5,B00364K7AU,"This movie is an excellent movie for all to see.  The reason for the rating is the movie transcends racial prejudice, racial bigotry, racial stereotype (on both sides, both Black and White), and showed a Black man in good loving light.  And, being set in the South, the movie helped eliminate the stereotype of the South.  Now, we know there are still problems, but as we move forward into the 21st century, we as Americans are attempting to build a better society for everyone.  All of us have our prejudice but this movie may help someone overcome prejudice.  The fact that Sandra Bullock's character (mom) stood up against her friends at the luncheon is a big feather in her pocket. She could have easily said something different.  And, the fact the mom did not believe all Black men just want to have sex with white women (or rape them).  Also, whenever they had to venture into the unsavory part of their town (to see his mother and to get clothing), he would protect Sandra's character no matter what (can't remember the characters names).  He also protected his step-brother when they were in the auto accident, not thinking about his safety.  I could go on, but this would get quite long.  Mrs. Washington gave the movie the 5 stars.  I probably would go with 4 1/2 stars.  I almost never give the full value because almost all movies have flaws.

4073868,5,B00364K7AU,"We're all familiar with the story of someone coming from nothing and becoming a champion or something else along those lines.  Well, such a story can still be inspiring today in the right context.  The Blind Side shows us that having someone coming from nothing get some help from someone who's coming from plenty can be just as inspiring.  Again, context is important and this film understands that perfectly.  And so we are taken on the journey that is the life of Michael Oher, played here by Quinton Aaron, as he struggles through school and eventually draws the attention of the Tuohy family, who ultimately take him in.  With some help from them, Michael discovers his love for football (a deviation from his real-life story, in which he was already pretty talented in the sport) and becomes a star on his high school team after he is prompted to think of his teammates as his family and apply his protective instincts accordingly.  This soon draws the attention of college coaches and eventually leads to an NCAA investigation surrounding Michael and his family's conduct in his college selection.  This is a great film and Sandra Bullock, playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, definitely earned that Oscar.  I felt an odd sort of comfort with her and Tim McGraw, who played Sean Tuohy, portraying a southern Christian couple.  They just worked so well together and Mr. McGraw displayed some acting chops I never knew he possessed.  I especially enjoyed the scene where he is explaining the meaning of the book that Michael is reading.  Kathy Bates was great as the tutor who happens to be a Democrat, but I think she didn't get enough screen time...come on, it's Kathy Bates!  She owned this role as she always does.  Ultimately, I found only one thing wrong with this film:  the montage of the college coaches coming to visit Michael.  While I thought it was beyond awesome that the real-life coaches of that time were playing themselves in the film, I found it beyond, beyond annoying that Sean ""S.J."" Tuohy, Jr., played by Jae Head, was bargaining for benefits for himself with each of the coaches.  I could have done without that.  There is no way, no way that happened in real life!  My only hope is that the NCAA representatives saw that montage and had a stroke.  Michael's alleged violation in regards to him choosing ""Ole Miss"" seems like a minor traffic infraction compared to what I saw this little kid doing.  But despite this glaring problem that I cannot ignore, this is a great film about an amazing and inspiring story that I'd highly recommend to anyone.  Enjoy.",1402617600,,2575,4.754504504504505

I think two reasons  may begin to explain it - one was Sandra Bullock's performance. She's been nominated many time for various awards, including Oscars, and won a few. All well-deserved, but this one topped them all. The other reason is Quinton Aaron. His size will probably limit his access to a lot of roles, but if he never  got another one (well, I hope he DOES), he already went to the top with this one.",1399680000,,586,4.518867924528302

4073995,5,B00364K7AU,"Separated as a child from his older brother Marcus and raised by a drug-addicted mother with 11 other kids in tow (his father was entirely absent)  16-year old Michael Oher barely registered on public records. Hed been in and out of foster homes since the age of 7 and with a below average IQ of 80 and school grades barely scraping zero  the American education system also considered him to be simple as well as useless. And few in the Hurt Village area where he lived (notorious Housing Projects in North Memphis) fended for him  let alone made it into their twenties alive.

One day a school football coach is approached in his offices by Ohers then black stepfather Big Tony the Mechanic (Michael is sleeping in his house on the sofa). Tony wants a place for his small son and 'Big Mike' at Wingate Christian School in Texas. When Coach Cotton looks out the window - he sees Big Mike (played to perfection by Quinton Aaron)- a grizzly-bear black teenager playing hoops like he was born to. But more than taken with Mikes athletic skills  Coach Cotton is moved (great work from Roy McKinnon). He decides right there and then to persuade a reluctant school panel to give this massive teenager a second chance.

They agree - but then feel they may have made a mistake - as Michael appears incapable of learning - and his sole contribution to an exam paper is to draw a sailboat on the back page with a singular child in it  lost at sea. But one teacher Mrs. Boswell (beautifully played by Kim Dickens) believes theres intelligence in Mike - if only she can find a way to get it out and up his grades (thereby keeping his place in the program)

Also in Wingate School are S.J. and Collins Tuohy  the 7-year old son and 16-year cheerleader daughter of Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy (Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock)  wealthy owners of 86 Taco Bell food outlets. They are a faith-based white family with little to worry about monetarily but genuine in their beliefs (dialogue above).

Leigh Anne Tuohy is a Southern Lady  all tight skirts, sunglasses in her hair, perfect make-up and possessed of a non-nonsense practicality aligned with a will of iron few will tackle (she mutters ""well all right"" all the time). But beneath all that steely mettle is a heart of gold  a woman who practices her Christianity - rather than just spend time with it on a Sunday. To Leigh Anne giving is as natural as speaking  and colour is not an issue.

Slowly Leigh Anne begins to notice her vivacious but tiny son S.J. gravitate towards the protective frame of Big Mike  a gentle giant with no malice in him and a handy ability to forget the past. One night walking back from the Coin-Op Laundry where Mike washes and dries one of only two teeshirts he owns (hes been made homeless yet again)  Leigh Anne is driving with her family in tow and spots Mike walking in the freezing night air in flimsy clothing. He seems lost and even defenceless. She makes a decision to give him a place to stay that night  the opulent Tuohy home. And so it begins  a loving relationship that will eventually see him become a member of the family and Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy become his legal guardians.

But then Mike begins to realize that when it comes to American Football  his 98% Protective Instincts (the only test he ever scored highly on) make him the perfect Left Tackle  the man who protects the Quarter Back. Soon huge clubs (six legendary football coaches make cameo appearances) are noticing his extraordinary natural ability to block anything that threatens his family (the team) and soon he is learning at school too. But it could all be derailed by the Social Services people who feel Leigh Anne may have set Big Mike up all along so that he would play for their beloved team 'Ole Miss' (Mississippi). Soon he is back at the drug-infested Projects and then the Coin-Op  confused and hurting

What gives ""The Blind Side"" a beating heart is that its beautifully played by all  especially Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron. There's a danger that it all descends into a rich-white-womans plaything  a patronizing project shes taken on  its not like that. Bullock is fabulous in the role (and deserved her Oscar) while Aarons dignity in the face of ridicule and pain is filled with a grace that is still, peaceful and intensely moving.

The BLU RAY picture is GORGEOUS  defaulted to Full Aspect  it looks incredible all of the time. In fact at times you can see just a little too much makeup. Audio is English 5.1 Dolby Digital, Castilian Spanish 5.1, German 5.1 and English 2.0 Audio Descriptive Service. Subtitles are English, Castilian Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Norwegian and Swedish. Extras exclusive to BLU RAY are - Sidelines: Conversations On The Blind Side, The Story Of Big Quinton, Michael Oher Exclusive and Acting Coaches: Behind The Blind Side.

As Michael studies for an exam  hes given the academic task by his teachers (who have come to believe in him) of appraising ""The Charge Of The Light Brigade"" poem by Alfred Tennyson. Michael surmises that you - ""Hope For Courage, But Try For Honour""

By the time the end credits roll - with real footage of Michael Oher joining The Ravens for the NFL Draft of 2009 as Team Member 74 - and then onto stills of him and his adopted Tuohy family  the tears are flowing and your warmth towards these fabulous people is genuine.

The true story of MICHAEL OHER is extraordinary - and John Lee Hancocks wonderful film ""The Blind Side"" does his redemptive life-path proper justice.

Lots of laugh loud and long moments interwoven with many poignant moments.  Yes, it's based on a true story and, yes, there are theatrical freedoms taken with the true story but not enough to have a work of fiction.

It seemed all too real with friends and teachers who don't want to accept a Black youth as a human being.  The succession of coaches trying to recruit Michael was particularly entertaining to a SEC conference football fan.

It didn't have the depth you would expect from a movie.  I  don't know if I would have been happy paying full price  to see this in a theater it  felt a little more like a made for TV movie offering you a 1000 foot view of each character.  Overall it was  a heartwarming movie that left you feeling good about life and worth watching if you like movies about the human spirit and it's ability to survive.
You can't help but love Big Mike for his insight and heart.

The family cast of characters were all amusing as well and kept the story moving along nicely.

4074247,5,B00364K7AU,This movie is well worth the watching. It brings a little bit of hope into today's discouraging rich-poor dialogue. It lets us know that we can be part of the solution to poverty and lack of opportunity. I was surprised that the woman's character was not portrayed as a Christian. It looked like she must have been. There was an obvious misquote of the Bible on the school motto. It would be good for everyone to look it up for themselves. It is engraved on the gate leading to the school.,1390435200,,489,4.384615384615385

4074268,2,B00364K7AU,"I'm a black male in my late 20's. I watched this in the theater. I really wanted to like this movie and it had the potential to be a good movie, but it was too melodramatic and stereotypical.

I didn't like the way that they portrayed Oher as basically being illiterate before he met the Tuohy's. I appreciate the fact that they took him in, but the movie made it seem like before they adopted him, he was reading on a 3rd grade level. That's just wrong.

They bought him a SUV that he proceeded to wreck when he let himself get distracted. The kid was in the car with him. Instead of chastising him for being irresponsible, they praised his ""protective instincts."" WTF?

The most ridiculous scene in the movie was when Sandra Bullock's character taught him how to play football. All of those coaches were there and he needed his step-mom to show him how to play football? (and based on Michael Oher's real autobiography, this was factually incorrect)

There was no gray area in the movie. Every character was either good or bad. The NCAA people who accused the Tuohy's of being boosters were bad. The all-white football team who played Michael Oher's team were also bad and made the predictable racist comments. Sandra Bullock's former gal pals were more subtle in their racism.

Another ridiculous scene was when Sandra Bullock went to the projects to look for Michael and then confronted that drug dealer. Some petite, blonde white woman is really going to stand up to a drug dealer?

This is an interesting movie, but I really wish they stuck to the actual story that occurred instead of trying to dramatize it. I also wish that they didn't portray blacks as ignorant thugs.",1390089600,7,1678,4.632996632996633

4074479,5,B00364K7AU,"""The Blind Side"" was one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen. Sandra Bullock, always a great actor who can adapt to a wide variety of rolls, does an outstanding job of portraying Leigh Anne Tuohy, the socially upper-class Memphis society woman who has compassion on Michael Oher, the overgrown kid from the projects, and who not only adopts treats him as a member of her own family but gives him the strength and courage to believe in himself. Quinton Aaron, in his debut as a lead actor, plays the part of Oher in a way that is truly believable.

But the acting is just part of what makes this a great film. The true story of a woman who is willing to step way out of her comfort zone and put her life and reputation on the line for a kid it would be easy to ignore (or fear) is more than just heartwarming. It is a testimony to what can be accomplished if one is willing to put his or her principles into action. It is also a testimony to how far someone who has come to believe in himself because someone else believes in him can go in life. (Although we know the end result before the movie begins--namely, that Michael Oher eventually will be a first-round draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens--this in no way detracts from the suspense and the excitement of the movie itself.)

This is not just a movie for the football fan. In fact, Oher's skills as a football player are simply the background for the main storyline and the message the film conveys.",1383091200,,1465,4.343065693430657

That said, I cannot recall Sandra giving a more commanding performance in her career. It's like she went to the Julia Roberts/Helen Hunt/Kate Winslet, etc., school of how to be a woman with sass an win an oscar.

As for the story, it was rather boring, predictable and insulting to me. Here we go again with the rich white family helping the poor african american (see ""The Help""). Apparantly, Michael Ohr, the real black kid depicted here, is writing a treatment about what really happened. That I would like to see.",1380240000,,702,4.519685039370079

So I guess the story is really about her, but for me it's not inspirational in the sense of - oh anyone can do this, because a lot of people don't have ultra rich sponsors.

I would have loved a story about someone who truly made it on his own or at least with working class parents. Of course this is based on real life, but I'm just saying.",1379203200,8,554,4.12037037037037

But all their copies of that movie were all rented out, So I picked up this movie. I came racing out of Blockbuster with a rented DVD copy of ""The Blind Side"" and said to parents, ""All of the copies of ""Old Dogs"" have been rented out, So I got ""The Blind Side"".

I cried most of this movie, despite trying to ignore watching it. It was so touching and well done. I honestly did not buy Sandra Bullock playing a redneck when I saw the previews, but when I watched it I quickly realized she was the perfect person for the part.

Can be emotional for some. Good story. Sandra did a good job!",1369612800,,105,4.25
4074684,5,B00364K7AU,"""The Blind Side"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Michael Oher, a homeless African-American youngster from a broken home, is taken in by the Touhys, a well-to-do white family who help him fulfill his potential. At the same time, Oher's presence in the Touhys' lives leads them to some insightful self-discoveries of their own. Living in his new environment, the teen faces a completely different set of challenges to overcome. As a football player and student, Oher works hard and, with the help of his coaches and adopted family, becomes an All-American offensive left tackle.

The cast led by Sandra Bullock (in her best performance of her career as Leigh Anne Touhy), Tim McGraw (as Sean Touhy) & Quinton Aaron (in a breakout performance as Michael Oher) is excellent! The directing and screenplay (based on Michael Lewis' book) by John Lee Hancock (who also directed ""The Rookie"" (2002) & ""The Alamo"" (2004, also wrote the story and screenplay), both also starred Dennis Quaid) is excellent!

The music by Carter Burwell (who also did the music to all of the Coen brothers' movies, ""The Rookie"", ""The Alamo"", & ""Twilight"" (2008) is excellent! The cinematography by Alar Kivilo (who also did the cinematography to ""Frequency"" (2000, which also starred Dennis Quaid & was directed by Gregory Hoblit), ""Hart's War"" (2002, also directed by Hoblit) & ""The Lookout"" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Mark Livolsi (who also did the film editing to ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001), ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005, which was directed by David Dobkin and starred Owen Wilson & Vince Vaughn), ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (2006, which was directed by David Frankel), ""Fred Claus"" (2007, which also starred Vaughn & also directed by Dobkin) & ""Marley & Me"" (2008, which also starred Wilson & directed by Frankel) is excellent! The casting by Ronna Kress (who also did the casting to ""The Rookie"", ""The Alamo"", ""G-Force"" (2009), ""G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra"" (2009) & the upcoming ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (2010) is excellent! The production design by Michael Corenblith (who also did the production design to ""The Alamo"", ""Wild Hogs"" (2007) & ""Frost / Nixon"" (2008) is excellent! The art direction by Thomas Minton (who also did the art direction to ""Radio"" (2003) is excellent! The set decoration by Susan Benjamin (who also did the set decoration to ""Wild Hogs"" & ""Frost / Nixon"") is excellent! The costume design by Daniel Orlandi (who also did the costume design to ""The Alamo"", ""Meet The Parents"" (2000), ""Phone Booth"" (2002), ""Cinderella Man"" (2005, which was directed by Ron Howard), ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006, which starred Tom Hanks and was also directed by Howard), ""Frost / Nixon"" (which was also directed by Howard) & ""Angels & Demons"" (2009, which also starred Hanks and was also directed by Howard) is excellent!

This is an excellent sports drama that is better than most sport movies recently done. This is an uplifting and moving drama that moves you and keeps you thinking until the very end. This is another hit from the director of ""The Rookie"".",1369526400,,3054,4.972602739726027

It was heart-warming, inspiring and best of all, a true story about an extremely caring, determined woman, Leigh Anne Tuohy, and her wonderful family who opened their hearts and home to a ""forgotten"" young boy whose life could have taken a very different direction without their love and support. Instead, Michael Oher excelled in school and in sports and is now an NFL Baltimore Raven. ""The Blind Side"" opens your eyes to the effect that basic human kindness and selflessness can have upon someone's life and it does so with humor and compassion.

4074720,2,B00364K7AU,"I don't get this movie at all. And I am beside myself as to why Sandra Bullock won the best actress oscar for this film. While this true story is inspiring, it feels like a hokey and cheeply made after school special, or even worse, one of the Disney movie that get's burried in the pile and forgotten in the midst of far better films on the subject. Bullock was simply splendid in her oscar winning role, but this is simply not a very demanding role at all. I just don't see what all the fuss was about. I was expecting something with more substance rather than the artificial 'Aww Shucks"" feel of this movie. I like Bullock and I think Quiton Aron was very good in a typicl understated role. But this film just felt like a shoddy attempt at a feel good movie that isn't respectable in it's typical style. The film was a rather bland disapointment for me",1367625600,2,855,4.316770186335404

4074751,5,B00364K7AU,"Media today portrays American society as degrading and decaying; news media especially. It covers poverty and negative aspects because they sell better; they don't show positive aspects as much. The media makes it seem like the government is corrupt and the people are horrible to each other and the world is going to end. To contrast this mainstream media, the director of The Blindside wanted to share one boy's success story with the world as an uplifting illustration of the goodness that still exists in the world; by showing the positive aspects that still exist in individuals. In the movie The Blindside, the director addresses three social issues to effectively portray to people of all ages the potential and goodness that still exists in humanity: poverty and charity, racism and stereotypes, and the definition of a family.
The director addresses the issue of poverty and charity through the characters to reveal human decency. One example of this human decency is when Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock, provides a home for Michael Oher and accepts him into her family. She decides to drop by his mother's house in the ghetto of the city so that Michael can go collect his things. The people who live there are poverty-stricken, and Michael arrives at his mother's house to find that she had been evicted and had disappeared. When he comes back to the car empty-handed, Leigh Anne drives to the nearest clothing store and lets him pick out some new clothes. She was under no obligation to do so; as a mother she had a lot of other responsibilities as well. Not many people would have taken the time out of their lives to drive all the way to the other side of town for Michael, nor would they have wanted to spend their own money on new clothes for him. This selfless act is one of many committed by Leigh Anne Tuohy that illustrates the kindness and charity that continues to exist in humankind.
Another instance that demonstrates Leigh Anne's generosity and kindness is when Michael asks her if he can get a driver's license. When she wants to know why, he simply responds `it's something to carry, with my name on it.' She ends up tracking his mother down, so that she can gather the papers they need to acquire a license and so that she can let his mother know how Michael is doing. After talking for a few minutes, his mother admits that she doesn't have his birth certificate, nor does she remember what his father's last name is. She then starts to cry, but instead of leaving, Leigh Anne sits next to her and comforts her. She tells her that Michael will always be her son, but that she is going to take care of him for her. Going through the long process of gathering the information she needed for Michael's driver's license was not an easy thing to do; nor was finding the courage to go and talk to his mother. Leigh Anne didn't have to do this either; she could have very easily told Michael that it was a lot of work to track down his past, and that she would rather not take the time to do it. This gesture of charity and love not only changed Michael's life, but the life of his mother as well.
The second issue the director addresses to illustrate the fact that positive aspects of society still exist is racism and stereotypes. After Michael has been living with the Tuohys for a while; Leigh Anne goes out to brunch with her friends and asks them what they know about the projects on the other side of town. They all make jokes about it and the people who live there, but when Leigh Anne doesn't laugh they ask her why she is so interested. She mentions Michael to them, and there is a mix of reactions among them. Her sister, however, questions Leigh Anne's decision; she wants to know how her daughter feels living under the same roof as a large, black boy. Leigh Anne just stares at her sister for a second before replying ""shame on you."" She then gets up and leaves, picking up the check on her way out. Her reaction to this racism is reassuring, because it shows people everywhere that race doesn't matter. Leigh Anne Tuohy didn't see a scary, troublesome black kid. She saw a seventeen year old boy in need of help, and she took the opportunity to do so. Many of us tend to judge people of other ethnicities based on the stereotypes associated with them. We can learn a lot from Leigh Anne and the way she treated Michael Oher.
There is another moment in the movie where stereotypes are overcome, when Michael takes SJ out to go buy a video game. They get distracted by the radio as they are driving down the road, and Michael ends up crashing the car. SJ was sitting in the passenger seat, and the crash was bad enough to set the airbags off, which should have killed him. Michael, however, managed to get his arm in front of the airbag and stop it before it hit SJ. Leigh Anne gets a call in the middle of a meeting and comes rushing to the scene, but she is more concerned than angry. She checks on SJ, who is hurt but not severely, and then goes over to talk to Michael. Leigh Anne had more than enough reason to get mad at Michael; he should have been paying attention, but he was also the one who saved SJ's life. Instead of getting angry, she makes sure he is okay and tells him that it could have happened to anyone. Her reaction of patience and understanding is a good example for us in times when our patience may be tested. We need to remember that bad things can happen to anyone, and that our understanding and compassion will go a lot further than anger ever will.
The final issue addressed by the director to display the potential of humanity from The Blindside is the definition that the movie gives to the meaning of family. The goodness in the world comes from the structure of family; they make you who you are. One of the main concepts that can be taken from the movie is the fact that family is not always defined as the people you were born with. Family is the people you surround yourself with. In the case of Michael Oher, he was born into some rough living conditions, and he managed to get out of the situation and join a new family with the help of Leigh Anne Tuohy. This is an important issue to address because there are a lot of arguments going on in society today about the definition of families, and what the parameters of one entail. The movie gives family a whole new meaning; it shows us that family is the people you love and care about more than the home you were born into. Leigh Anne was willing to welcome a complete stranger into her home, and she never expected anything in return. The Tuohy's, in turn, ended up gaining a new family member, and Michael Oher's life was changed for the better. That is what family should be about.
The Blindside is a movie that goes to great lengths to restore our faith in the goodness and potential of humanity. Three important social issues are brought up throughout the film; the director does a great job at showing these issues as they are in real life, and does even better at teaching his audience how these things can be overcome. We would do well to keep Leigh Anne Tuohy's attitude in mind as we go about our lives; when told by one of her friends that she was changing Michael Oher's life, she simply responded, ""No, he's changing mine.""",1365638400,,7271,4.45536384096024

I was pleasantly surprised when I viewed it for the first time.  I was not aware of how family oriented it was.  It left me with a warm fuzzy feeling that is rare these days.  Sandra Bullock is exceptionally good as a southern woman of prestige.  She is the driving force behind the whole movie.  I was very impressed how this movie kept most of it's origins truthful.  Sometimes it doesn't make for a very interesting movie, but in this case, I think it lended a certain level of curiosity that kept me wanting to watch it to the end.

4074816,4,B00364K7AU,"A beautifully told story that seems to be true and accurate, but notice the subtle stories intertwined in the main story?

First, there is the story about the father, owner of a multitude of fast food restaurants, who is so abundantly reaping the financial rewards of his ownership that he and his family can live a life in extremely grand style. What about his employees that are doing the work, providing the service, maintaining the properties, how are they living? How are they paid? (And yes, I know the mother seemed to be doing work for financial gain too and that also contributed to their financial success.)

Secondly, note the harsh, negative presentation of the NAACP representative. Possibly it was accurate, but also it is good that someone was questioning what happened to this young, talented neglected boy. Too many poor children have been taken into custody to then be used as servants for their caretakers, so bravo there are representatives from the NAACP and other similar organizations that are checking things out and hopefully they aren't brow beating the children as was shown in this portrayal.

All in all it is a movie worth seeing as long as one doesn't let their Blind Sides negatively affect you.",1362441600,,1227,4.889423076923077
4074817,4,B00364K7AU,"I first saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it then.  I really enjoyed the DVD!  It's one of those story lines that would be unbelievable, except that it is based upon actual circumstances of Michael Oher, All-American college football player and first round NFL draft pick.  I will admit it, I enjoy a heartwarming tale every once in a while, and sports movies always interest me.  This movie falls into both of those categories.  In my opinion, it would be a great movie for the family to watch together.

The parade of college head football coaches (playing themselves) and the too precocious boy (SJ) are weak spots.  Although I'd imagine that young boys would look at SJ with admiration.  I felt the rest of the acting was top-notch.",1362268800,,744,4.6692307692307695

4074828,5,B00364K7AU,"Each of us can share - it is the process of someone giving and someone receiving. A greater society is one whereby giving and receiving are a choice - the decision to take action from one's heart...A fine film that tells a story about Love, about kindness and about being a greater society. Being 50 yrs old, having grown up in the south, having lived in LA 30 years and worked in ""The Industry""  this film is a keeper for everyone. If you are from the south you'll catch humor that others will miss ! If you are a school teacher, it is a fine film for an essay assignment. The story told has something for every political point of view and celebrates the hero in our individual power and the hero of our once longheld national identity to 'lend a helping hand to those in need' and to give thanks for one's individual wealth by sharing some with those in need by individual acts of kindness and giving. This story says that anyone of us can make a difference if we choose and that ""In to the hands that give, the gift is given"". So eloquently stated by Leann after a friend said ""You are changing that boys life"" and Leann responded, ""No, he's changing mine (for the betterment of her soul and values)"". Leann demonstrates the power of love and acceptance when she meets Michaels mother...a mother reaching out to another mother and sharing the plight of motherhood. Great messages that each of us has the power within to live if we choose. Beautifully acted, tenderly told and captures out times.",1361664000,,1498,4.487179487179487

Just to see how one family changed the life of one boy by embracing him and considering him one of their own is just hard to believe it was a true story.

4074942,5,B00364K7AU,"We have long enjoyed sports and articles or books by Michael Lewis.  This movie is not really so much about the ""blind side"" that Lewis explained in his book with the same title for football fans, as it is about being truly kind and color blind.  Sandra Bullock does a great job of being a tough, loving mom to a huge young homeless black teenager.  Rich, white, Republicans with two children of their own prove that love and sympathy are not just for bleeding heart liberals.  The new family confronts the problems Big Mike brings them one at a time:  No place to sleep?  Stay with us.  No clothes? That's what stores are for. Can't read? The ""Christian"" school our kids go to, should be able to help with that.  A mother who is a drug addict? She'll want what's best for her baby.  Big but unwilling to fight on the football field? Pretend you're protecting your family.  Smarmy maybe, but true.  This is a great story that could become a Christmas season favorite.",1356912000,,967,4.5

S.J. was such a cutie and the scene where they are in the truck singing rap cracked me up, Yeah Baby! Collins showed an adult role in a teen. ""he wanted a truck"" ?

4074965,4,B00364K7AU,"This movie is very good. There are a lot of nice developed characters and a really nice story of redemption. The reason why I am not giving it a 5 star it's because there are some unclear things in the movie. Like we never really figured out what happened to Oher and his brother and why were they separated. Oher's past has not being explored enough. Also, the character interpreted by Sandra Bullock's husband is little too submissive, which he is not in real life. It is made for the purpose of making Bullock really dominant force in the family, pulling decisions in adopting Mike etc.. However, the movie portrayed her husband little bit like a pansy and not like the man in the house. Also, as I Christian I don't like american football because it is too violent and I don't like Christians cursing and stuff which happens in the movie on couple of occasion (b word). Also Christians should not revenge and retaliate which Sandra Bullock does all the time. But overall, this movie has a good lesson.

4074972,5,B00364K7AU,"QUICK SUMMARY (SPOILER ALERT)
The Blind Side is a heartwarming true story about the life of a young African American named Michael Oher. He grows up living in foster homes around Memphis, Tennessee, because his mother couldn't take care of him properly. He becomes friends with a young white boy, and somehow manages to win the heart of the boy's mother almost immediately. She feels the need to take care of him, and the family decides to take him in. Eventually he becomes part of the family and is officially adopted. It seems like he has a promising future in football, and eventually makes it to the NFL.

THE TITLE
The title ""The Blind Side"" has two meanings to it. In football, which is a big part of what the movie revolves around, it refers to the area that the player cannot see, which is where he could get tackled from. Michael was the one who covered the quarterback's blind side.  This relates to the movie since Michael becomes a football player. The title also refers to what happens to the family. At first the family is a little bit resistant, as well as the family's friends who just call it ""white guilt"", but eventually, Michael begins to feel accepted at home and at school. The family grows closer to each other, and they seem happier than they did before Michael came along. Before Michael came, they were blind. Now they could see.

OPENING LINES
The movie begins with ""There is a moment of orderly silence before a football game begins.... Players are in position, linemen are frozen, and anything is possible. Then, like a traffic accident, stuff begins to randomly collide: from the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone, is closer to four seconds than five."" Leigh Anne Tuohy is narrating a football game. Then, she goes on. ""Because as every housewife knows, the first check you pay is for the mortgage. But the second is for the insurance. And the left hand tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming..... To protect his blind side."" This opening phrase immediately explains what the title refers to, as it is mentioned within the first three minutes of the movie.

SUMMARY (SPOILER ALERT)
The movie begins with a scene at Wingate Christian School. Mike has been living with his friend, and the friend's father tries to get the two of them accepted into the school. He talks with the sports coach, who immediately sees something in Mike. Coach Cotton manages to get Mike into the school, despite his lack of proper education. Mike doesn't do too well at school, but he manages to befriend a little boy named SJ. When SJ and his parents are driving home from a school play, they see Mike walking outside in the rain. They decide to bring him home. Leigh Anne, the mother, tries to straighten out Mike's life by buying him clothes, and even driving him to the projects on the other side of town, where Mike's mother and friends live. The family becomes closer and closer to Mike, and Mike is even in the family Christmas portrait. Football tryouts are starting soon, and the coach is excited for Mike to try out. SJ tries to help him get fit, and the two become really good friends. After having the time to bond for quite some time, Leigh Anne suggest adopting Mike. As she is getting paperwork sorted out, she finds out more about Mike's past and why he was taken away from his mother. Leigh Anne decides to visit her in the projects. Mike keeps practicing football and eventually becomes the star player. Universities from all over are interested in recruiting Mike, but he first needs to get his grades up. Mike gets questioned by a social worker who suspects the Tuohy's from using him, just to get him to play for their favorite university. Mike runs away, and soon enough Leigh Anne finds him in the projects. He eventually graduates with a 2.52 GPA and goes to Ole Miss, where the rest of his new family has always gone to school.

COMMENTARY
I think that the performances of the actors are really great. Quinton Aaron did a great job, especially since this was his first starring role, meaning this movie was his acting debut. I also think Sandra Bullock did an amazing job. She's actually one of my favorite actresses, and having seen most of her films, I think this is definitely one of her best ones. At first, she actually refused to play the role three times, but then finally accepted after being offered the role four times. She didn't want to play a southern Christian woman, thinking people would start to make assumptions. She made the right choice by accepting the role anyway. I feel like the rest of the actors were also very good. All in all, the casting director did a great job. I only do not like Kathy Bates at certain moments, because the line is supposed to be funny or something, but then she delivers it the wrong way. Not always, but just a couple of times.

Overall, I think everyone involved with this movie is very special because it's based on a true story. Obviously, everyone who acted in this movie really had to understand the story completely, and they really had to do ""research"" in order to be able to play their character so well. This proves that they are not only very talented on film, they are also interested in real life situations like this, and are willing to invest their time into really looking into the issue. Of course they knew it would be a big hit and they would earn a lot of money from it, but I'm sure they all found the story compelling. It must also have been very stressful for the actors to have to play an actual person, rather than being able to develop the character traits yourself, because obviously the real people would be judging the actors and would either approve or disapprove of the way they would be portrayed in the movie. Leigh Anne on Sandra Bullock: ""`She wanted to know everything about me,"" Leigh Anne Tuohy says. ""I would take her to Ole Miss when there was nothing going on, and we would eat on the square (in Oxford). I can see why she has been so successful because she worked really hard to understand everything from my thought process of taking Michael in to how I talk.'"" (Billy Watkins, The Clarion-Ledger)

I also think that the storyline is really well done. Everything makes sense and happens in chronological order. The only thing that I might have changed if I had the opportunity to, was the beginning. As it is in many movies, the story ""begins with the end"" and then flashes back to when it all started. This method works fine with a lot of movies, but I personally wouldn't have done it with this movie. Some people might get confused at the very beginning already, and that would make the storyline just a little harder to understand. For example, my little sister was already confused at the beginning, because she didn't get how Michael went from talking to a social worker, to being in the projects. But this is just my opinion, I'm sure many other people think this was a great way to start the movie. They ended the movie very well, though. It was great how they showed real pictures of Michael Oher growing up, along with real pictures of the Tuohy family. It made everything seem much more realistic and intriguing.

Overall, I think the movie is fantastic. The story is fascinating, and the cast and crew did a great job.

HISTORICAL ACCURACY
There are many African American stereotypes addressed in this movie. The first one being the housing projects. Michael and his black friends as well as his family, all came from there. As shown in the movie, it's dirty, old, dangerous, and crowded. This is indeed how it is in some places in America. Some African Americans don't have enough money, and are forced to live in these projects as they cannot afford anything else. This creates a sort of ""black community"", a place where the white people would not want to be found because it's so dangerous and different. In this movie, the housing project where Michael Oher is from is called Hurt Village (it's real, not just for the movie). It started out as being a resident area for white people un Uptown Memphis, but eventually attracted many different ethnic groups and immigrants from Europe. After the Mississippi River flooding, many African Americans moved there too. During the 1960s, racial tension increased and after the assassination of Martin Luther King, most of the white people decided to leave Hurt Village. After that, most of the population consisted of African Americans, just like today.

The housing projects and other predominantly black communities are a source of riots, fights, and other forms of violence. This is shown clearly in the movie, when Michael's mother gets evicted from Hurt Village, or when Michael gets in a fight with his friends when he comes back to visit after running away from the Tuohy's because of an argument with Leigh Anne. Therefore, I think this stereotype is accurately depicted.

Another stereotype is about the Tuohy family, and the whites in Memphis in general. In the movie, Leigh Anne's friends don't seem to be so fond of Leigh Anne's plan of taking Michael in. They think he is dangerous and might even harm Collins. They haven't even seen him in person, but immediately assume the worst. This is what you may call a typical reaction of a Southern woman about an African American. It may be pretty old fashioned, but it definitely does still happen. This relates back to the the past when Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and so many others were fighting for civil rights for blacks. Although Michael is definitely ""accepted"" in this society, he isn't ""liked"" particularly. There is still some tension and fear. The white people in Memphis still make assumptions about him and his family and friends in Hurt Village. For example, Leigh Anne admits she's never been to ""this part of town"" before, when she visits Hurt Village for the first time, even though it's very close to her home. Of course, Leigh Anne had to be that one person who takes a stand to do what is right. She was the one who broke that racial barrier and helped someone in need regardless of what they looked like, and regardless of what everyone else would think.

WATCH IT?
This is definitely a movie you should watch. It's a fascinating and moving movie about the life of a promising young boy. If you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should, because it really is just a nice story, and you might as well learn something relevant to your history class, because the movie is pretty accurate when it comes to history. I think that if you're into history and southern culture regarding race, or if you're just into football, this is a great movie to watch. Who knows, you could learn so much that you might even be the next star NFL player!",1354924800,,11071,4.6267820773930755

I rarely purchase movies to own. I'm much more of a renter than a purchaser and it's not often that I'll watch movies a second time. But I can see us watching this several times, and as my kids get a little older, I think they'll really enjoy this, too. My 10-year old son loves football and anything sports-related, and for the most part, this movie will be appropriate for him to watch very soon.

4075026,4,B00364K7AU,"The Blind Side tells the story of Michael Oher, a homeless kid from the projects who is taken in by a devout Christian family and made part of their family.  They see to it that he gets a good private education, so he can earn a football scholarship.  Oher eventually becomes an All-American at Ole Miss and then the first-round draft choice for the Baltimore Ravens.

The story is well-told and inspiring.  Sandra Bullock is particularly good as the mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy.  Bullock won the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as the Critic's Choice, Golden Globe, Screen Actors' Guild and People's Choice awards.  Ironically, Bullock had turned down the role three times because of her concerns about playing a devout Christian.  After accepting the role, she almost quit a couple of weeks into filming, because she thought her acting was doing an injustice to Tuohy.  Apparently not!

The blu-ray transfer is great.  Visuals and audio are both strong.  The disc contains interviews with Michael Oher, Aaron Quinton (who played Oher), Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sandra Bullock.  Parental Advisory: While the movie does feature one scene of violence and a couple of allusions to sex and drugs, it is suitable for family viewing.  The Tuohys are commendable for their care of Michael.  The power of their example outweighs a couple of minor negative elements that might necessitate a word of explanation for very small children.

One goof in the film.  Above the gate at the Christian school, is an inscription that says, ""With man this is possible, but with God all things are possible.""  This is a misquotation from Matthew 19:26, which says, ""With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.""  Apart from this, the movie makers handled the Christian aspects of the film quite well.

I highly recommend The Blind Side.  While it does take some liberties with the true story of Michael Oher, it nevertheless gets the basic story right.  The result is heart-warming.",1352073600,2,1984,4.9156626506024095

Sandra Bullock again shows that she is an ""actress"" not just a whiney voiced romantic comedy fixture.  She conveys with absolute believability the affection she feels for her new ""son"" and the lengths she will go to to protect him. The fact that this is a true story just makes it more wonderful. Nice to know that there are really people like this family still alive and well in our country. Supporting cast is excellent. Beautifully filmed,directed and acted.",1351814400,,544,4.540816326530612
4075029,2,B00364K7AU,"ugh....a movie about a rich white happy christian family that adopts a little homeless doggy. The big shaggy football player is a gentle giant who protects the family in various ways--he watches their ""blind side."" Its a foot ball analogy. During a car accident, he reaches out his arm and protects the little brother from flying through the windshield and becoming a human cannon ball. He has these natural ""protective instincts."" Like the way he protects the playeres on the football field, he also protects the adoptive family. Blah blah blah. And they all live happily ever after.

Perhaps the worst line in the movie is when Sandra Bullock says, ""No, I'm not changing his life, he's changing mine,"" or something corny like that. I think we could make a list of corny scenes and lines.

Who knows what the truth is about this story, or how Michael Ohr really got into the NFL. This story is so self congradulatory.

There is one small part in the movie that I do like. The part where Michael Ohr reads the poem ""The Charge of the Light Brigade."" It is about warriors who march on when they know they will probablly fail. About the courage to do something really hard, like go to a new school where you don't know anyone.  But the rest of this movie is just so syrup-y. I guess you could watch it when you need a serotonin surge.

The whole story, ultimately, is told from Leanne Touhy's vantage point. Every one in her world has names, personalities, goals. Everyone from Michael Ohr's world is nameless, goal less, hopeless. Obviously, Leannne thinks this kidnapping is a form of salvation for ""michael."" Reminds me of Madonna going to Malawi to try to adopt some kid she knows nothing about, from a world she has nothing but pity for.",1351814400,4,1740,4.618122977346278

Starring a 17-year old black kid that's in and out of foster homes who's never really given a chance, a very considerate white woman comes into his life and changes it completely. She (Sandra Bullock) gives him a new chance at life with her family and he starts to turn things around...

It's about 25% football and 75% emotion.

A good watch that sorta drags towards the end.

Nice for the older bulk of the family to enjoy. Has some language and brief drug use towards the end of the movie.

Her facial expressions are worth hundreds of words, and the interactions between cast members is classic. In addition, the movie is though-provoking. Every viewer can learn much about human nature from the interplay of the family as they are adding a new member. Every teacher should be required to watch it over and over and realize that only one of the teachers in an excellent private school is willing to look behind the surface and see the child and teach him.

4075062,4,B00364K7AU,"I had heard many rave reviews about ""The Blind Side"" and I had read an article (I believe the book came later) about Michael Orr in the NY Times magazine section so I know the story. So I came to watch the DVD expecting disappointment. But I was pleasantly surprised. Although a tad sentimental the movie manages to stay just one side of schmaltzy and a much of this comes from the no-nonsense practical understated sensibility of Bullock's portrayal. This is a woman who does what she thinks is right, rooted in her faith and ethics, but without making a song and dance about it and just doing it.
Bullock's supporting cast could not be better. Each one of the actors completely inherits his or her character and dialog flows easily and naturally a quality which is not always easy to maintain. There are some nice little touches too - the Thanksgiving Dinner where Michael, inspired by a Norman Rockwell painting, insists on eating at the dinner table while the others are watching television, and ends up getting his Norman Rockwell minute.
This is not the very best sports movie I have seen which is why I rate it 4 rather than 5 stars. That is still ""Chariots of Fire"" in my book. But it ranks with ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Hoosiers"" which is pretty high praise.",1346803200,,1269,4.594713656387666

4075077,5,B00364K7AU,"""The Blind Side"" is a drama film based on true events.

Teenager Michael Oher is the nucleus of the story, and he has had a difficult upbringing. He is accepted into Wingate Christian School on compassionate grounds with a view to make a contribution to the school gridiron program.

Oher doesn't have a permanent residence and the Tuohy Family notice him living meekly and offer him shelter. What starts as a temporary arrangement becomes long term and he is adopted by this family.

The essence of the narrative is that by opening their home and hearts to Oher the Tuohys are able to help him realize his potential in sport, academically, and in family life.

The film contains a wonderful cast who present the characters with warmth and authenticity.

It is a movie which allows the viewer to appreciate that giving can change a life, and that the love of a family is the greatest wealth a person can have.

4075089,4,B00364K7AU,"This was a very inspiring movie, and I really enjoyed it. It's always nice to see someone going from having nothing to having everything, especially when that someone is such a nice, gentle man who deserves it. Even if it was just because he was in the right place at the right time. In this case, he was homeless in the right place at the right time, which was a little different than usual. Sandra Bullock using that weird Southern accent took a little getting used to, but a third into the movie I almost managed to forget about it.

The only annoying thing was all the college recruiting. It's so sad that good students - even students with straight A's - have to fill out tons of applications and pay tons of application fees begging for admission (and pay tons of tuition with tons of interest) while other students have the colleges begging them to choose them just because they have the skill to knock someone over on a field, or some such talent. Seems kind of skewed. (But that's how we end up with the millionaire sports stars while other Americans get by on $40,000 or worse, minimum wage.)

In any case, I am glad it was a well-acted movie based on plot instead of a sports movie. Football tends to bore me, as do most sports, unless I am playing them. There were football scenes, of course, but they fit the plot and they were brief instead of overdone. After all, we already know he's a football star, so we don't need to see him win 16 games, right? Especially when they do that thing where the winning goal/touchdown/basket/point/whatever is scored in the last half a second. Like we haven't seen that a hundred times!",1333238400,,1635,4.483221476510067
4075090,4,B00364K7AU,"I know it's been out for a while now but the fact is I didn't have the chance to see the film THE BLIND SIDE until this past weekend. All I can say to those who are following in my footsteps on this movie, you'll regret waiting once you have the chance. This movie far outweighed THE HURT LOCKER when it comes to what should have won for Best Picture at this year's Oscars. Understandable, though, as the film features no political motivation which seems to be how you win any more.

For those who haven't seen it, the film is the true life story of football star Michael Oher and how a series of fortunate events led him from what could have been the most miserable of lives to one of fame and fortune. But more important than those qualities is that Oher was led by some unseen force to find a family and a home.

Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is a young black man, big for his age, who gets a chance to go to a private school with the hope of playing sports. Unfortunately his grades disqualify him from participating. With low test levels and a low level learning ability, it seems as if Michael isn't long destined for this school. Few of the kids take an interest in being friendly to him with the exception of young S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head).

One cold and rainy day after being picked up from school, S.J.'s mother Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) watches as Michael walks in the rain. When asked where he is heading, he says the gym because it's warm there. Realizing the boy has no home, Leigh Anne invites him to stay the night at their house.

A one night invitation turns into a long term situation as Leigh Anne decides to take on the responsibility of helping this young man. Husband Sean (Tim McGraw), daughter Collin (Lily Collins) and S.J. all welcome Michael into their home. Leigh Anne takes Michael shopping for clothes and helps him with studies as well. The teachers at the school help too as they realize Michael isn't stupid, he's just never been in a learning environment that encouraged him to study. Michael's life begins to change immediately.

The help of the teachers and Leigh Anne pays off when Michael's grades raise enough for him to join the football team. But this huge player isn't what the coach expected as he tends to be non-aggressive on the field. Recognizing the coach just doesn't understand how to reach Michael, Leigh Anne walks onto the practice field and tells Michael that the team is his family and that since he has said he'd do anything to protect his family, he should apply that to the field. In so doing, he becomes the lynch pin to the success of the team.

A twist in fate appears towards the end of the film as Michael's decision to go to Ole Miss for college is questioned by the NCAA. They feel that perhaps the entire incident of Michael's mentoring and guardianship by the Tuohys was nothing more than their using him to help their alma mater. The answer as to the truth in this can only be found within Michael's heart.

The success Oher was able to sustain thanks to the help of one woman who made the decision to see to it that a human being wasn't just dumped one more time is what makes up the center of this film.  The football, the fact that Michael Oher is black, the rise in education and status are all planets that circle the sun here.  And that sun is the story of a person who was willing to ignore mindless comments, ignorant claims and the world around her in an attempt to simply help someone get a step up.

Some have claimed that this is just another example of white people helping out blacks in an attempt to make themselves feel better. They miss the point of the film entirely. That's because while Bullock may be the star, the real story isn't about Leigh Anne Tuohy. The real story is about Michael Oher and his taking hold of the opportunity provided to him and making the best of his life.

Rare today is it that we are presented with a film that contains as much heart as this one does. Even God is given a center piece in the film as it takes place at a Christian school. Too often films are mired in the nasty sides of life, the worst the world has to offer. Even in the scenes in this film that involve Michael's old neighborhood we get the chance to see him rise above and move forward.

This movie offers all you could ask for. It offers plenty of laughs at the oddest of times. It offers portions that will touch your heart and bring a tear to your eye.

4075091,5,B00364K7AU,"In case you're wondering about the acronym, it stands for ""Make A Difference"", something that, even though churches and well-meaning parents try to teach people, rarely EVER happens. And when it does happen, who notices? Apparently, someone noticed and brought to light a situation most of us would be uncomfortable trying to be around. And the one who would dare to go into it has more guts than most.
A young black man that gets ragged on by a bunch of white people at a predominantly white ""Christian"" school can't stand it. The way the teachers treat Michael is rather disgusting, acting like he's just another lost cause, since he can't read and doesn't seem to pay attention worth crap... the reason they took him in? One of the teachers threw out a provocative thought, that if they weren't willing to give someone who hadn't been given a chance in life, they may as well take out the ""Christian"" part of their school's name.
Turns out, that wouldn't be enough to help him. The teachers feel like they may as well give up on him, yet it takes one person to see through his struggles, the superficiality of all her rich, white friends, and do something- she challenges him to make his life better. Academically, that'd be a long shot, yet worth it if he can pull it off. His one winning shot? Use his anger, confusion, frustation, and more into a medium, something he's good at- football. But it's not only the friends of the woman nor the teachers who show socially racial bias against this newcomer from nowhere, even a redneck family gets a good chewout by Mike's newly surrogate mother. Literally everyone who portrays any trace of racism gets a good chewout to appropriate degrees, and no one can prepare for the wrath of this one mother who shows she can see through the surface of other people, see their potential, and help them. No matter what it takes.
Helping Mike find a place to call home, finding people he can call family, helping him find people to identify with, no matter where from. Even the people from teh ghetto try to take him in, but end up making the mistake of making sexually degrading remarks about the mother and her daughter and Mike being around them. Not a good idea when the guy you're making bad jokes about is literally at least 2x your weight and, despite having a gentle nature, can take you out very quickly and very well.
From Mike (the well-sized, misunderstood man willing to be different and hates the way others treats him as though blacks should be gone and is grateful someone sees him as a human being and treats him as such) to the Tuohy family, these people literally transcends social barriers in every way.
When I first heard of this, it was through the movie poster. Saw it was a football movie (which I can't stand), so I decided to not try it until I saw the trailer for it, then wanted to check it out.

I go to see movies all the time while they are still in release.

At this time of year we have high profile movie offerings like A Christmas Story, New Moon (same vampires), and the world coming to an end with 2012. So. it's easy for this movie to get lost in the shuffle.

It would have been so easy to miss this movie, and such a mistake to do so. For, this is one of the best movies of the year, and one of the few I recommend whole heartedly.

Sandra Bullock gives probably the best performance of her career, playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, a tough business like mom, who sees big Mike, a young oversized kid who never had a role model, and who never did well academically, because he had no reason to believe in himself. He is the underdog we love to root for.

The Tuohys take him in to their plush house, and we get drawn into the experience, perhaps sucked into this story might be a more apt description. Yet Mike has a hidden gift which others like the sports coach can identify, and other teachers start to have faith in him, so who knows what will happen.

If you're like me it's a movie about the importance of a mentor and believing in people, the more you believe in them the more they start to believe in themselves. If you like this one, I also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akeelah-and-the-Bee/dp/B000G1R38U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akeelah and the Bee</a>, another five star movie. In its first 14 days The Blind Side has done over $108 million at the box office, assuring that it will be one of the big hits of the year.

While the Academy does not typically reward comedies with awards, Sandra Bullock may get a nomination, and so might the writers for best adapted screenplay, and she might win a Golden Globe for her performance.

A point of interest in the movie is Lily Collins daughter of Phil Collins who plays Sandra Bullock's daughter.

Update, Jan 29, 2010. As she has now won the Golden Globe, which is a dress rehearsal for the Oscars, I expect she will get the Oscar nomination, and it sets the stage for an interesting contest with Meryl Streep for her performance in Julie and Julia. Both actresses played real life characters, with an interesting mix of drama and humor. Although Oscars are not usually given for this type of performance, the exception is Marisa Tomei in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Cousin-Vinny/dp/B000SFOW8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Cousin Vinny</a>. I predict this will be the year of the exception. Streep has been nominated 15 times winning only twice. This would be Bullocks first nomination.

Update 2/3/2010. The Blind Side has been nominated for 2 Academy Awards, for Best Actress, and Best Picture. As of 2010 the Best Picture category has been expanded from 5 to 10 pictures, partly because of falling ratings, and partly because many popular movies have not historically received the same level of Oscar love, as movies such as The Blind Side has received from the public.

Blind Side has grossed over $238 million dollars domestically, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of 2009, and no 63 all time for domestic box office, and it's still in release.

Wonderful, Heartwarming, Endearing, Encouraging and Inspirational!

Based on a true recent story about Michael Oher:
How he was embraced and rescued out of a life of homelessness and grief (by the Tuohy family).
How he was challenged to achieve his full potential.
How he added a deeper dimension to their already rich & full lives, gave their lives greater meaning with the essence of who he is as he touched their hearts.
... and so much more.

I came away with deep desire to meet this amazing young man - not for what he's accomplished in the spotlight, but for the wonderful person that he is.

The Blind Side took the true, inspirational story of a talented, incredibly determined, intelligent and focused young man and turned it into a sick fantasy of a white family taking in Magilla Gorilla and teaching him to block'um people and read'um English.

Bad, racist perspectives are not new in Hollywood.  What is scary is that those involved made a conscious decision to portray this man as a mentally-challenged animal.  What, they didn't have Oher's phone number to ask if this story was accurate?  We know from Oher's own book that the depiction was offensive to him.  We know from other true accounts that Oher was helped by many people, but first and foremost, by himself.  It was Oher's personal qualities that roused people to help him down the road he was determined to travel; not the help of others that made him want to be something.

More frightening is how thrilled the public was to see this film.  The movie missed not one racist trick, including throwing in that he was violent!  The trash about his testing high for ""protective instincts"" (sounds like an American Kennel Club description of a pitbull, not a human) went down like chicken soup with white audiences.  The beauty part was, apart from the football field, he only was violent toward black people!  The scene of him knocking a few black heads around got the biggest ""YAY!"" of the evening.  Gee, wonder why?

This is a movie that is a classic. Sandra Bullock deserved her oscar for this picture.
I only buy movies that I want to see over again and that are of high quality content.
A great film to teach people lessons about life.",1311465600,,302,4.410714285714286
4075145,5,B00364K7AU,"I am sure it is just coincidence, but this week's Gospel in Church is about how an enemy has sown weeds into the field of the Master's wheat (see Mt 13:24-43). I think one of the messages of the reading(s) is ""patience"" with the world, with others, and with ourselves. Frequently, we are little aware of the weeds that have taken root in our lives, although we are quick to see them in others. All the while the weeds can have a dominating affect on the good we also possess.

I was reminded how this movie is a good example of this message & more. Michael Ober had more than a few negatives overshadowing his life. The Touhy family, especially in the form of Sandra Bullock, was able to see the good, in spite of all else, and enable Michael not only to look past it, but to excel. Most already know the ending before watching the movie: success in the form of college, scholarship, All-American and NFL. Not bad for someone who was abandoned only years prior.

In this true story, credit must be given to John Lee Hancock for his great directing. I suppose the final product would not be what it is without great editing also (mentioned in other reviews). I found Sandra Bullock an essential ingredient in the movie. She was terrific! I never saw her in such a role, but her acting does the job. It is an incredible film: with all the anguish & excitement!",1310774400,,1358,4.4063745019920315
4075146,5,B00364K7AU,"This is a movie that stays with me and comes to my mind regularly. That it is based on a true story makes it even more significant to me.

I am so impressed with how kind hearted and brave some people can be, willing to take a lot of risk for what they believe in. This is a heart-warming movie that makes me believe that there is hope for the future and learns me that by giving you gain. I have a lot of respect for this wonderful Leigh Anne Touhy that Sandra Bullock portraits so well.

The acting is brilliant and the story well told. Highly recommended.",1309392000,,558,4.157407407407407

4075148,5,B00364K7AU,"A great movie of hope, love and dedication. Dedication not only from the player, but also the family that brought him in. They help not only with his sport but also his education, even if it was to get him to college it has a great message of the importance academics should have with the athlete. Great true story!",1308441600,,315,4.3559322033898304
4075149,3,B00364K7AU,"Nothing wrong with that really.

This movie is technically good and in another league than many other films with overt Christian themes (with the exception of the Narnia films) in terms of production values. Michael Ohrer is a role model in how he overcame his poor childhood to the NFL through sweat and determination.

Here's the downside:

This film misleads people as to how inept Ohrer was on the football field before arriving at the Tuohy's house. He was a 6-5 black kid who didn't know anything about football, you see. It would see this angle was inserted to make it appear that the Tuohy's generosity was entirely based on their Christian principles, when in reality, 100% of the black boys they adopted went on to their alma mater and the NFL.

In short, this movie literally vilifies all blacks except Ohrer himself. The problem with race relations in America, this movie teaches us, is black people. A scene where Bullock's character threatens some black thugs by telling them she's a member of the NRA is torn from the white Republican fantasy book of the nature of crime and violence.

The Tuohys just might've saved Ohrer's life, but they all don't need to be so proud of themselves about it.",1307923200,2,1208,4.733333333333333
4075150,5,B00364K7AU,"We love this movie!!!  It's so inspirational, well-written, perfectly acted and--the best part--a true story!  I hope it inspires others to serve others as selflessly as this family did.  It has something for everyone and our whole family enjoyed it.  If you allow your children to watch it (I wouldn't recommend anyone younger than 10 for many reasons), please watch it with them and use it as a way to ask questions/offer information about some of the topics addressed in the movie: adoption, differences, diversity, compassion, community service, faith, and more.  Performing community service as a family not only helps others, but you'll find that you and your family will grow stronger because of it.

I felt inspired by his admirable story. Well shot, portrayed, and timed. Characters and actors are superb, adding to the realism and environment of the movie.

The whole family can enjoy this movie and the little fella who plays the youngest son is just great.",1304035200,,306,4.482142857142857
4075155,2,B00364K7AU,"I gave this movie two stars only because it is supposedly based on a true story, so the director had some restraints.

I watched it in two sessions.  It started out as an intriguing story, and I was curious how Michael would end up.  In the middle it became more and more predictable that he would become a football star thanks totally to the coaching of Sandra Bullock and his annoying adopted kindergartner brother.  Altho a huge man, he had shown no inclination to or interest in football.  I turned it off.

Two days later, I thought, no, there will be a surprise twist coming and it is supposed to be a great movie, so I hit Start again.

Ugh! The plot became more and more predictably stupid as it went.  The one possible redeeming moment was when Sandra Bullock asked, ""Michael, do you even WANT to play football?""  I was holding my breath, hoping against hope that he would say ""No, not really"" and move on to his own life goals.  But no, he didn't even answer, simply said ""Well, I'm pretty good at it"".  And it was straight down the trite hollywood sewer after that.",1303862400,9,1076,4.411167512690355

I'm not going to describe or critic about the story line or the film progress to the end, that's no point.  What I got from this movie is a message that I think it is beautiful.  It is the act of kindness, caring, loving.  A relationship that bound by soul.  A family who have a heart of gold.  This is not easily found in this day.  BRAVO.",1302998400,,477,4.108695652173913
