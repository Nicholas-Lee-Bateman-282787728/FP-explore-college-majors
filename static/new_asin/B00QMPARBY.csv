6876468,5,B00QMPARBY,"WHAT A GREAT INVESTMENT!! There are lots of resources available for people bringing home a new puppy, whether the pup is comes from a reputable breeder, a shelter or rescue. But there has been a real shortage of science-based, best-practices information for anyone (reputable breeder, foster or rescue) caring for a litter of puppies from before birth until they go to their new homes. This DVD collection brings together wonderful information, clearly explained and illustrated. With the ADDED ADVANTAGE of bull terrier puppy footage!

As a Certified Training Partner for the Karen Pryor Academy of Animal Behavior and Training, and a member of the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, I have to congratulate Jane Killion on a wonderful production that will provide tremendous benefit to dogs and their humans.",1417737600,8,832,5.4
6876469,5,B00QMPARBY,"Puppy Culture is a fantastic, comprehensive resource for breeders, puppy raisers and puppy owners.  The set of 4 DVDs is an in depth look at how to raise a puppy during the first 12 weeks of life.  I am not aware of any other book, video or DVD which addresses how to rear a puppy during this period as extensively and accessibly as Puppy Culture. Puppy Culture is an invaluable asset in raising a puppy to be the best that they can be. It basically guides breeders step by step as to what can be done with and for their puppies at each point in their development to ensure the best possible outcome for the puppy. It's a ""how to"" on raising a confident, happy puppy that seeks out enrichment opportunities. The DVDs are a primer on everything from early neurological stimulation to how to safely socialize puppies to how to prevent problems such as resource guarding. Puppy Culture also contains great information for new puppy owners as to how to set up socialization sessions, picking a puppy kindergarten class, balancing exercise and rest, teaching basic skills such as sitting for greeting, etc.  Based on scientific research as well as extensive hands on experience, Puppy Culture artfully weaves expert interviews with icons as Dr. Carmen Battaglia and Jean Donaldson along with videos that follow one litter through the first weeks of their life and beyond.  The DVDs are fun to watch, and will surely be a resource that breeders and puppy raisers will want to refer to and view again and again.  I can't recommend Puppy Culture enough!",1417737600,10,1545,4.75

The video follows an expert dog breeder as she raises a litter of puppies for their first 12 weeks.  This is filmed very well but it is not just an animal planet fluff piece- the scientific aspects are included and explained by various professionals.

I am not rich and $70 was a lot of money.  It is good material- good filmmakers- brought interviews from experts in on the cds - makes logical sense- but I got bored with cd #2 and haven't finished watching yet.

Definitely going to try this.... help puppies adjust and not be aggressive when grown so they won't end up in the pound.  Already was doing early neurological stimulation that I had found from military government research to help puppies so this wasn't a new idea for me --- but exposing puppies to noises and scaring them slightly makes sense.  Think most in house Breeder probably already help the puppies a lot - maybe not everything- but just shows you what puppy mill puppies are NOT getting and why you may have problems with them",1502323200,8,921,4.42603550295858

Be prepared to get addicted to the program and start putting in lots of time and effort building jungle gym toys and the like and going out of your way to raise your litter in a developmentally sound method.  Highly recommended to all breeders to up their game !  New puppy owners, or expectant owners should see what it takes to raise a litter and WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER BUY FROM A PUPPY MILL !  They just don't raise a litter with this special approach, even if they are making well bred dogs by virtue of genetics.

The material is clearly presented and makes so much sense.  We wish we had this information with our first dog; although she was wonderful and we loved her dearly, our lives together would have been easier and more enjoyable had we known and employed this information.  We just welcomed 2 Australian Shepherd puppies into our family; their breeder follows the Puppy Culture program.  The difference is very evident.

Jane explains how to work with very young puppies and provide a foundation for advanced training as they grow. Although I use clicker training, I have never started puppies at 3-4 weeks old and am eager to see how quick they learn being so young. My goal as a breeder of Jack Russell Terriers is to give them the best start and socialization for their new family. Too many dogs end up in shelters because people don't take the time to train them.

6876504,4,B00QMPARBY,"Overall excellent information for new breeders.  Great sections on fear periods and early puppy training,however, she drops the ball on bite inhibition. Killion has Jean Donaldson discussing how to prevent resource guarding, but nothing on training your pups to have a soft mouth. Bite inhibition is extremely important so that if the dog ever does bite there is less risk of severe injury. With so many dogs being surrendered to shelters and rescues breeders cant afford to not teach pups to have a soft mouth.  Just turning the pup's face away from you and 'waiting for the pup to grow out of biting' will not teach the pup bite inhibition. If breeders use Jerry Hope's or Dr Dunbar's book along with the DVD series you'll raise great pups with a good start on all the skills they need to make perfect companions.
Also, after explaining all the steps to prevent resource guarding and how often you should practice, she then says if breeders don't have time to do the exercise more than once, its OK. If breeders don't have the time to properly raise and train all their pups to fit well in human society, they shouldn't be breeding a litter. If all breeders raised pups correctly and placed them carefully, our shelters wouldn't be overflowing.",1455580800,9,1246,4.763888888888889

6876517,5,B00QMPARBY,"I recently picked up my 8th Siberian husky at age 9 weeks and immediately started using Puppy Culture protocol exercises on him. I had been visiting him since age 5 weeks and picked up this DVD set before taking him home. I quickly learned that although the Puppy Culture process begins at birth, even puppy buyers can benefit from applying these exercises and games to their new addition. I've lived with Siberian huskies for decades and have an approach that works for the most part, but gained some real insight into ways I can shape behaviors more constructively. The whole rest period concept when puppy brains are processing new data was eye opening. The process of teaching the puppy to 'mand' by using the Communication Trinity Exercises (I didn't use the clicker as I have hand issues that complicate this) has also been useful to me. Jane also does a great job of offering the WHY rather than just the HOW of a process. As a vertebrate scientist, this is something I needed as I find that I do a better job of finetuning things if I understand the rationale behind the technique.  I only wish that the next installment (proposed release in 2016) was available NOW. In the interim, I'll be reading her book When Pigs Fly!: Training Success with Impossible Dogs .",1437350400,14,1271,4.674107142857143

She discusses the stages of puppy development, the science behind the information presented, and shows you exactly how to perform the all the hands on training at each stage of development.

6876521,5,B00QMPARBY,"I am stingy with five-star recommendations: Puppy Culture deserves five stars  or more. The wonders of Puppy Culture - everything contentwise, everything visual, everything style-wise, simply everything. Puppy Culture is simply amazing.

Author Jane Killion, with signature pony tail and baseball cap, has done an excellent job  informative in covering best practices for raising puppies from prenatal to 12 weeks, entertaining in that the stars  bull terrier puppies - are, in a word, simply adorable.

Take notes on this four-DVD series. You cannot watch it all at once  so, thank goodness, when your mind tends to slow down after incorporating enough super-material in one setting, you will be rejuvenated by watching the delightful puppies as they grow up before your eyes. I would not be surprised if you watch the DVD at times just for entertainment and to get your puppy-fix! You just want to cuddle them! Or watch them sleep.

Experts featured in Puppy Culture, besides Killion herself, include a veterinarian, a puppy evaluator, the highly respected Jean Donaldson, veterinary behaviorists, a veterinary neurologist, and breeders   virtually a Whos Who in the Dog World.

How Killion managed to get so many of the very best people in the dog world, I have no idea. Might it be because Killion herself is so talented in dealing with dogs as well as people?

Topics include socialization, early neural stimulation, developmental stages, and puppy training. Yes, training puppies  they soak it all up: you cant not train a puppy.

Goats milk? The Communication Trilogy? Feeding raw?  The startle reflex? 50 Lessons in Puppy Living!

Killion wrote the sleeper 2007 book When Pigs Fly: Training Success with Impossible Dogs. Killion is a bull terrier breeder with years of experience. Killion is a dog trainer extraordinaire. Killion is an expert in dog agility circles as well as conformation, rally and obedience. Killion is a gem. Killion is not to be missed! As a matter of fact, I am considering driving four hours just to meet her.

Puppy Culture is more than five hours of video expertise, professionally photographed. It has made this reviewers list of Top Ten Dog Books of All Time. Yes, a DVD can be a book, but a book with pictures  moving pictures and a book you listen to AND watch rather than just look at.

Included in the set is a viewing guide with each discs titles, subtitles, presenters, and times so you can go directly to the topic you need.

An excellent script comes across as being natural conversation  not too much information, not too little. Short sentences with plenty of visuals appropriate to the words almost like a slow-paced music video but with the visuals melting in to each other at just the right speed so you can also grasp the cuteness of the pups.

Killion knows puppies, heat-seeking milk missiles, and has observed them and their growth and behavior for years. She passes that knowledge on, never giving too much information to absorb.

I would have done things very differently with our last dog.  I now understand why he had certain fears and how he developed them.  You will adore the Bull Terrier puppies shown in the video.

6876526,5,B00QMPARBY,"If I could give Puppy Culture 10 stars I would.  This DVD set gives breeders, and rescues, and fosters, an absolutely amazing array of indispensable information for raising puppies from birth through 12 weeks.  As a breeder of more than two decades I found gems in every section.  I learned when to use, and when to avoid, early neurological stimulation for the greatest benefit of my puppies.  I learned when to expose puppies to certain noises, and when to avoid this, in order to build resilience in the adult dog.  I learned to balance socialization needs and vaccination safety.  I learned, and learned, and learned some more.  New breeders, you need this!  So much practical information to help you, great tips, resources, and an amazing array of great practices.  It's like having an amazing mentor who never leaves!  Experienced breeders, you need this too, even the most experienced breeder will love learning all the science behind these ""best practices"",  when to do thing, when to avoid things, and why.  Even after twenty years of breeding we were able to make some minor changes with huge payoffs for our puppies.  You will love the balanced information, ""Pros and Cons""  of many techniques and beliefs, there is a tremendous depth of information here.  You will love the experts, and more experts!  I loved that the most respected names in their areas were here, giving me the science behind so many subjects, from preventing resource guarding, to vaccinations and socialization, to helping your families find a safe puppy class.

I sent a copy of Puppy Culture home with each puppy from my last litter, it was wonderful knowing that each family would understand all we had done for their puppies, but the greatest part was giving them a resource they could refer back to as they become responsible for socializing and training their new puppy.  The puppies benefited from a continuity of technique, from our home to their new home, as the new family could easily refer back to the DVDs to help them with training and socializing, as well as house training, crate training, and manners training.  The section on finding a good puppy class, what to look for, what to avoid, is SO important because so many lifelong behavior problems can start in a poorly run puppy class.  The section on finding a good puppy class is outstanding and should give families the information they need to identify a well run puppy class for their puppy.  The transition from our first Puppy Culture litter has been nothing short of amazing, every family has commented on how easy these puppies are, how quickly they are mastering house training, how mannerly and attentive, how happy and how quickly they overcome difficulties, and how Puppy Culture has given them so much training and management information to make the transition to their home smooth.  They feel like they really understand their puppies and are empowered to work with their training and behavior with confidence.  We get to have conversations about how fun, and wonderful the puppies are, and ""nope, no problems or questions, the puppy is doing GREAT"" conversations.  I love teaching folks how to house train puppies as much as anyone (after all, I'm a Certified Professional Dog Trainer, and work with owners and dogs for my job) but it's been nice seeing how our clients have utilized the DVD for this information, we when we talk we are talking about how wonderful their puppy is, and not going over house training challenges.  No matter where you have obtained your puppy, or even if the breeder/foster/rescue has utilized Puppy Culture, you will LOVE this DVD, you will understand your puppy better, and have a huge array to tools and techniques to use when raising your puppy that are safe, sound, science based, and uber effective.

We have had feedback from moms and dad that their kids have also LOVED the DVD set, and ask to watch it often, and this has had the unexpected benefit of the children reminding their parents about the best ways to handle the puppy as well.  Priceless.

Oh, and if all that wasn't enough, the DVD set is well organized so you can find ""that one thing"" you were looking for so easily, it's beautifully produced, the narration is easy to understand and well written, and of course there is the benefit of watching an adorable litter of Bull Terrier puppies growing up right in front of your eyes.",1423094400,12,4396,4.825333333333333

6876528,5,B00QMPARBY,"This dvd is a terrific resource for new puppy owners.  I got my puppy at 9 weeks old and she was fearful of most everything.  After watching Puppy Culture, I better understand how to socialize my puppy be more confident, what to look for in a Puppy K, and how to deal with her biting.  The dvd has so much great information -- it is well worth the money.  And the fourth recap disc is a great way to refresh my memory on important steps to take.",1417996800,5,445,4.080459770114943
6876529,5,B00QMPARBY,"I think most breeders (any breed) WANT to do the right thing to raise their puppies, but don't often know exactly what that might be.  This video goes through step by step during each week of a puppy's life, explaining what is going on with the puppy physically and psychologically and what you can do as a breeder to optimize the puppy's ultimate development to becoming a stable, happy individual.  I have been breeding almost 20 years and still learned many things I did not know.  I have a litter now and it has become my bible.  I encourage anyone who has been breeding for a short time or a long time to buy this video, it is a must.  You won't be disappointed!",1417996800,8,667,4.346774193548387

8691931,5,B00QMPARBY,"SUCH an amazing gift that our breeder (Lagotto And Friends and Tenajeff Lagottos) gave to us by starting Puppy Culture for the first 10 weeks.  When we got our puppy we were amazed by how calm he was, such a sweet guy and everything they did to help that we continued on with.  Strangers are amazed that a 10 week old puppy (now 14 weeks) will just come up and sit instead of jumping on them! Wish we had known about Puppy Culture when we had our first dog ;)",1532822400,,459,4.088888888888889
