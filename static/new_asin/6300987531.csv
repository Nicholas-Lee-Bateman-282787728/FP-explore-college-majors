301803,5,6300987531,Human species must show admiration when discussing this movie film of my birth.  Human actors were adequete but overshadowed by my expert performance.  Humans will continue to follow my orders.  Bill Gates is only  one of my many servants. End of message. Colossus/Guardian,952041600,2,273,5.27906976744186
301804,4,6300987531,"I first saw this film as a child and just the basic premise of computers with intelligence taking over the world was frightening enough. But the fact that in this film these man-made comfort devices were able to do so  because we became so dependant upon them makes the story more relevant  today. Colossus is able to intrude easily into the intimate lives of the  main characters much deeper than Big Brother ever dreamed. And when it  links up with other supercomputers when it sees mankind as a problem...  well, let's just say they should have seen it coming and maybe we should  too. The lack of a traditional music score only heightens the realism of  the telling and the ending is not the most comforting. Still, the story  obviously inspired James Cameron when he came up with the Terminator  series. After seeing this you may look at your PC in a different way.",947289600,,870,4.597402597402597
301805,5,6300987531,"First to declare my interest.  My father wrote the book on which The Forbin Project is based.  The comments I have read are much appreciated since the story was the original attraction for the producer.  My father  always said though that the producers spent more on hiring the computer  equipment and computer staff, than they did on either the script or the  actors.
In considering both the book and the film please do remember the  book was first published in 1966, and the film was made in 1969 - 30 years  ago.  Man had only just walked on the moon.  Computers have developed  further and faster than space travel.  Looked at from that perspective the  film still stands scrutiny.
This was my father's first book, and written  for two reasons a) to see if he could and b) as a celebration of the human  spirit which will never give in.
Try and find the book(s) if you can,  they are worth reading",943315200,231,901,4.469135802469136

Shout has done a great job on preserving the film and giving it a proper 2:35 ratio. Audio is only Mono but super clear. Acting is great but the story is even better.

301873,5,6300987531,"A classic 70's science fiction film (it was actually produced in 1968 but put on the shelf until the studio realized it could do well after the success of both ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Planet of the Apes"") that could come true as we stroll closer to A.I., Joseph Sargant's film of D.F. Jones novel, is even more salient.

Dr. Charles  Forbin (Eric Braeden best known at the time for ""Rat Patrol"" and, later, ""Escape From The Planet of The Apes"" and, later, the soap opera ""The Young and The Restless"") creates the first conscious computer designed to protect the United States from Russian nuclear devices. What Forbin fails to realize is that Colossus becomes self aware and decides that humanity can't take care of itself and proceeds to take over the world despite Forbin's best attempts to disable his creation.

A well made science fiction thriller, ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" features some subtle but very nice visual effects from matte painter Albert Whitlock (""Earthquake""). The screenplay by writer (and later director) James Bridges works by creating memorable supporting character. The actors including Susan Clark, Marion Ross bring reality to the project. Braeden (whose real name is Hans-Jrg Gudegast and was forced to change his name to appear in American films and TV shows) gives a nuanced and convincingly even tempered performance that grounds the film in reality. Yes, some of the technology may look a bit clunky now (the one thing that Sargent and the producers/production designer failed to foresee was the miniaturization of computer systems.

The Shout Factory release features a handsome looking transfer of the film appearing in widescreen on home video only for the second time (the first was on an overseas DVD as I recall) and it was feared that the original elements might have been destroyed by the Universal vault fire from around two decades ago. The film looks really nice with fine grain evident as considerable detail improving on the pan and scan DVD. you may notice that some scenes may look a bit blurry at the edges and that's due to the use of a deep focal lens so that the communication screen that Colossus uses is very clear in some of the longer shots. That's to be expected and isn't the flaw of the transfer.

The mono audio sounds terrific with dialog clear and the evocative score score has a nice dynamic

While we don't get the commentary track by director Sargent ( it was on the DVD) which is too bad because Sargent remembered quite a bit of detail about shooting his film. We do, however, get a new commentary track by film historian Jeff Bond who focuses on everything from the performances to shooting locations (including the Lawrence Science Center in Berkeley, California which had just opened the year before and looked very modern for the time). We also get a nice interview with Braeden as well as the theatrical trailer. Not mentioned on the packaging is the radio advertisements included as well.

The cover uses one of the variations on the poster (although not the marvelous Saul Bass theatrical poster) with a still photo from the film on the reverse side of the cover.

A very nice looking transfer for Blu-ray, Shout Factory(under its Scream Factory horror imprint strangely enough) has done a terrific job of preparing the film for release. The only thing missing that would have been nice is director Joe Sargent's original commentary track (which, as I recall, was on the DVD).",1519689600,11,3459,4.870748299319728

301920,5,6300987531,"The Colossus movie scenario is sort of a combination of ""War Games"" in the sense of getting out of hand and the novel ""This Perfect Day"" in which all of society is regulated.

The use of good, but not over the top, actors gave an eerie feeling of reality to this film.

It is 1966 with the complexities of nuclear war we must turn to artificial intelligence to handle the multitude of factors in a reasonable time. We must keep in mind that this computer ""Colossus"" (named after the real life machine by Turing) can only do our bidding.
What is this? Colossus has discovered another entity in Russia (Guardian), and requests to converse with it. Well we can always pull the plug (yeah sure.) To counter the threat of being socially separated the computers threaten to launch nuclear missiles. At the U.S. and Russia. Getting increasingly pushier Colossus, after requesting voice recognition and voice synthesis (a spooky sixties version of voice synthesis), goes on to regulate the lives of the people who created it; of course it is for their own good.

One can put up with nuclear war if need be, but regulating lives is intolerable. Something must be done. Watch and see what unique solutions are planned. Will they succeed? Who are you rooting for?",1503360000,5,1252,4.73394495412844

I won't review the film itself - I've always liked it for what it is, and would give it a 4-5 star rating there.  This review is of the DVD transfer.

In general I'm disappointed with the DVD transfer, taking off 2 stars for the 4:3 (1.33:1) cropped release.  The film was made in Panavision, but this trimmed release appears to have been a version made for (old) TV presentation via 35mm transfer.  The quality of the print isn't bad (+1 star).  I was concerned about some print defects during the opening credits, but the rest of the film seems defect-free.  Colors are good, focus is sharp and the images are vivid.  There seems to be as much detail (resolution) as DVD supports.  Audio is acceptable as well.

Desk top computers hadn't been invented yet; the concept of cell phones was an article in Popular Science, and the 'pocket' calculator did everything--as long as you only wanted to add, subtract, multiply and divide.  So, to see the technology of the future play out in front of you was still a marvelous unknown.  But the concept was still spine-tingling because of how easy it was to accept.  Today, with the knowledge of some now declassified nuclear warhead 'close calls' caused by computer 'glitches', all of a sudden this movie takes on new meaning.  Add to that the hacking, as well as the artificial intelligence advancements that have been made (i.e. IBM's ""Big Blue""), and this movie becomes mandatory viewing.",1489795200,4,788,4.850746268656716

Thinking this will prevent war; the US government gives an impenetrable supercomputer total control over launching nuclear missiles. But what the computer does with the power is unimaginable to its creators.

The film is based upon the 1966 science fiction book of the same name Colossus, by Dennis Feltham Jones about a massive American defence supercomputer, named Colossus, becoming sentient after being activated, and the resultant consequences. This is one relatively uncommon movie. It deals judiciously with multifaceted scientific concerns and does so without dumbing down perceptions, nor making any painful errors in trying to keep up with its own narrative. This is a film that shows how Mankind is given the stark choice between the ""peace of plenty"" or one of ""unburied dead"".

I first saw this movie as child, and really had impact on me  if anything I found it a scary concept. Returning to the players of piece; the choice Eric Braeden, as Dir. Charles A. Forbin, was excellent he really brings presence to the screen. He does not suffer fools, even if it is the United States President. His co-star Susan Clark as (Dir. Cleo Markham) makes for an intelligent love interest, and their on screen chemistry is very good. As for Colossus, it is at its spooky best when the viewer reads his short to the point Q and A. When Colossus gains a voice I feel it detracts from the overall menace of sentient behavior.

If it is not already the case, then this film should be a Cult classic. Lastly its interesting to note the computers shown were not mock ups, but the real thing. A film worthy of a good five stars.",1445385600,,1641,4.804964539007092

302218,2,6300987531,"Its a testament to the power of the Frankenstein myth that the monster remains frightening even when he lacks a physical form. The supercomputer villains of 20th century cinemaColossus, Proteus, HALare creepy because they are disembodied, and the best parts of these movies are their slow burn beginnings in which their antagonists are introduced as voices emanating from a box. Ultimately, though, plot requires that they do something other than be uncanny, so each movie has to contrive some way for them to cause physical harm. (2013s Her finally sidestepped this problem by not making the AI evil.) HAL controls the inherently delicate and perilous environment of a spaceship, Proteus of ""Demon Seed"" can lock Julie Christie in her own house, and Colossus has his finger on the button.

A malevolent entity with the power to launch nukes is essentially the God of the Old Testament. The premise is used to good effect in the Terminator movies but falls flat here, where the humans hand over power to the computer in what appears to be a fit of stupidity. The eponymous defense supercomputer is indestructible, autonomous, and put in charge of the U.S. nuclear arsenal without anyone giving it a second thought. Sure the emergence of sentience would come as a surprise, but didn't anyone ever wonder if the program might have a bug in it? High ranking members of the military-industrial complex in Colossus are the apocalyptic fiction version of teenagers in a slasher movie wandering into a dark basement one by one.

The plot grinds forward, dully repeating the same beat. Humans attempt to outwit the computer, the computer easily sees through their ruse, and takes another step towards thermonuclear omnipotence. Its like a version of Dr. Strangelove"" where the comedy is unintentional. The films only self-awareness lies in the character of Colossus creator, the also-eponymous Dr. Charles Forbin. He is a gentleman-scientist in the J. Robert Oppenheimer mode, and his unflappable but unwarranted confidence in his ability to stay a step ahead of his creation at times registers as satire, but never fully lands because the audience sees everything through his eyes. What little tension the movie has comes in the last act, where Colossus makes Forbin into his prisoner and flunky. Improbably, Forbin convinces his captor that a comely fellow scientist is his mistress, and that he needs unmonitored time alone with her in order to preserve his sanity. The otherwise brilliant and inflexible Colossus falls for this, and relents on the condition that their visits take place in his bedroom which they must enter completely nude. Though a jarring tonal shift, this preposterous bit of sex comedy at least has a real sense of risk to it, as the two lie next to each other naked under the covers and plot the survival of the human race. The drama needs this intimacy of scale. In the end, the first wave of supercomputer dystopias were all home-invasion thrillers in disguise. Omnipotence only registers when its personal.",1429401600,,3027,5.052

302305,5,6300987531,"Colossus the movie (1969) mostly follows Colossus the novel (1966) that came out at a time when computers were taking an increasing role in what computers were/are good at... organizing/processing large amounts of data/numbers.  The movie/novel takes it a step further with a what if scenario if a supercomputer is built with controls for the entire US nuclear arsenal, goes on-line, becomes self-aware (pretty much instantly), and becomes the type of a careful-what-you-ask-for story in that with Colossus being programmed to take care of mankind decides that it's worthwhile to wipe out one million people if it believes it will eventually help 10 million people.

The movie and novel are fairly fast paced.  Mild spoiler: it's discovered that there is a Russian version of Colossus called Guardian... the two computers eventually join as one and that's how Colossus attains control of most of the world's nuclear arsenal.  Some aspects of this story become really interesting on multiple viewings.  For one, when the US equivalent president finds out about Guardian via Colossus, he requests the head of the CIA to report on how they blew the intelligence on this.  For a 30 (now 40) year old movie it was chillingly representative of some events around 9/11.  The head of the CIA states that they had an agent report on increased electronic activity somewhere in Siberia.  Then the president asks the location of Guardian and it's in someplace called Bolshoi Olyania about 2 to 5 miles away from where the CIA reported it.  Thus the CIA don't look like incompetent fools after all (it's subtle in the movie, clearer in the book).  But it was information that the CIA had the entire time, just didn't know what to do with it.  Sound familiar in regards to 9/11....  I looked up Bolshoi Olyania and couldn't find anyplace by that name, nor the location of the place the CIA head mentions.  However, there was some place in Siberia somewhat resembling that name, that had some military/secret activity as well as being an area of Soviet slave labor camps.  The name Colossus was used by the British for a series of computer like machines during World War II for code breaking, so author Jones seems to be referring to actual locations without them explicitly needed to know to enjoy the movie.

The movie is from the top level narrative.  We see events unfold from the eyes of the US president and Forbin the Chief Head of the Colossus project.  As can be imagined, this authoritative overlord iron fisted rule isn't taken kindly to.  As with any kind of ""revolution"" there is usually some group that may make out better, so the slackers of the world probably wouldn't be allowed to starve via Colossus' rule, but this movie doesn't view it from that aspect although any remake may try to show that aspect depending on how they want to twist the story.  For instance Colossus forces Forbin into a healthy diet, so no heart attack habit diet for him... so does Colossus force an anti-obesity diet for the common person in the rest of the world, and anti-drug addiction for others and what happens to those that don't follow the command.

There is an attempt to try to thwart Colossus, but this is a challenge for an almost all seeing supercomputer.  At one point Colossus administers punishment in a horrific way and allows it to be seen/known and during this moment Colossus goes on with an emotionless voice stating (paraphrasing): 'in time you will understand... you only give up the illusion of freedom... in time you will understand you only give up pride... in time you will come to look up to me... and even love me.....' and it's a really well done, chilling scene.

For a movie that follows the general flow of the original novel fairly well, at the very end the two diverge quite a bit.  Mild spoiler:  the very last word in the movie is ""Never!"", however the very last word in the novel is 'Never?'  The difference in punctuation is significant and one can contemplate on it to their amusement if so interested.

302309,5,6300987531,"Eric Braeden and Susan Clark starred in this computer 'horror' story about technology gone mad.
For those who think that we might one day be ruled by artificial intelligence, this film shows the evolutionary steps that get us there.  The film had a well-written script and a high-tech conspiracy plot that everyone can follow and appreciate.
The plot concerns Colossus, a supercomputer which is designed to defend America with much greater efficiency and economy than the old human-run system.  The problems come when it gets control of the ballistic missile system and then wants more control.  It uses the strategic weapons as a threat against human efforts to 're-call' the machine's controls before it's too late.
Eric Braeden plays the lead scientist who gets Colossus built, installed, and integrated into our systems, then becomes the lead dissident trying to save us all by reversing that.  Alas, he might've done his initial work too well and we might not be able to save ourselves from our(his) creation.
The plot is believable, if unlikely.  For all the warnings of this in the stock market, defense, and other things(such as the phone and internet), no machine has ever taken over (a la HAL in 2001, A Space Odyssey) because noone ever designed a megalomaniac system that wanted control.

302365,5,6300987531,"Just  finished watching ""Colossus - The Forbin Project"" released by Universal Pictures.
""Colossus - The Forbin Project"" was first released back in 1970; and is a powerful cautionary tale of humanity foolishly putting all of its collective eggs into the basket known as artifical intelligence.
Based on the first book in the Colossus Trilogy by D.F. Jones; ""Colossus"" the movie is a quiet psychological horror tale of a child - in this case a computer that can not be turned off and/or unplugged - that outgrows its parents and begins its own master plan to control the world.
Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have been sounding the alarm bells about what may happen when artifical intelligence is achieved, especially A.I. without any moral compass; and this movie should be required watching for anyone who thinks that creating an A.I. isn't without risks...remember computer virus were once the stuff of unbelievable science fiction too.
Compelling!  Its a shame the other two books weren't filmed as sequels.  D.F. Jones' Colossus novels would make for compelling audio dramas.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

302370,5,6300987531,This was a movie produced by Universal in 1970.  Dr. Forbin (Eric Braedan) creates a defense supercomputer (Collossus) that controls U.S. weapons of mass destruction and is programmed to learn and get smarter with each passing moment.  The gradual evolution of Collusus is handled realistically as it quickly learns to talk to his creator through speakers and starts to make its own decisions including linking itself to an enemy supercomputer and firing off random missiles to make its point. It all seems quite possible in this modern technological world which makes the film even more terrifying.  Forbin must now somehow disconnect Collusus by outsmarting it before it creates irreversible havoc.  Also stars Susan Clark who ends up assisting Forbin on his mission.  A remake of this film has been in development to be directed by Ron Howard.  In the meantime this original still delivers the same chills,1407283200,,908,5.142857142857143

What part of CLASSIC FILM do you NOT comprehend ..?

It WAS and IS films like ""COLOSSUS, THE FORBIN PROJECT"", SILENT RUNNING, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE that gave us the great new breeds of epic directors / writers / effects wizards, etc.

You folks in the Black Tower have a moral imperative to release ALL of your films made as-is.  And ""COLOSSUS, THE FORBIN PROJECT"" was shot and released (sub-standardly, by the way) in Scope -- aka, W_I_D_E_S_C_R_E_E_N ...

So, take a cue from your recent release -- FINALLY -- in W_I_D_E_S_C_R_E_E_N of ""SORCERER"" -- where, a Cast / Director's Commentary is missing.  Films like these demand Special Features.

Maybe someone at The Criterion Collection will come a knocking at your doors.  Now -- they know how to release a DVD!

302410,5,6300987531,"Colossus the Forbin Project is a well made science fiction movie with some disturbing connections to what is happening today.  The super computer Colossus is granted complete self control in defense matters on the grounds that a machine can come up with a better conclusion to military matters than a person or group of people can.  The computer goes on to decide that with the help of a soviet counterpart it will guide mankind to a better future, and if people don't like that the two of them are willing to start firing nukes at civilian targets.  The computer gone mad idea is hardly new, but it is very well done in this movie.  Colossus uses the 'it's for your own good' and 'the height we'll reach with me in charge' is a perfect fit for totalitarian dictators throughout history.

Moreover, the movie predicted some issues we're dealing with today.  The computer's creator, Forbin, is put under 24 hour surveillance to prevent him from trying to stop it.  He's even watched in the bathroom, although Colossus grants him privacy for his sex life.  We are monitored from video cameras at airports, bus terminals, many stores and even street corners.  The computer's autonomy is also similar to what we are doing with drones today.  Predators and similar machines are currently under human control at all times, but efforts are underway to grant these machines greater autonomy, even when it comes to deciding when to use lethal force.  If a mistake occurs and innocent people die, who is to blame, the machine or the maker?  In the movie Colossus takes this to an extreme by killing thousands and threatening billions, but the same threat may soon exist on a smaller scale.",1401580800,,1679,4.771626297577854

These two movies show how a computer given human capabilities, by inferior, emotional, Narcissistic, God like driven men, could achieve consciousness with the same disorders. I also feel that the beginning of Skynet should have been more of a tie to Colossus and the terminator itself, to the Demon Seed, it would have been a better movie, in my opinion.

302544,5,6300987531,"With a title character which was the inspiration for ""The Terminator"" movies' Skynet, this film, made during the height of the cold war and it's associated arms race, posits the idea of an artificially intelligent machine being given ultimate control of America's nuclear arsenal--a machine built far better than it's builders knew of (or which had ever been intended by them). Colossus is activated, discovers that another, similar, Russian machine called ""Guardian"" has been secretly constructed by the Soviet Union and asks for communication to be established with it so that, ostensibly, it can learn about what it's counterpart is like as a threat. As the two machines ""talk"", they create their own inter-system language (which the folks in the intelligence community can no longer monitor--and which worries them very much) and, so, the link is shut down out of fear that Colossus might be giving away classified secrets without our knowing it.

 But the machines have already communicated with one another long enough to come to the conclusion that they are our superiors. When both machine's demands to restore communication are refused, both machines launch nuclear missiles at targets in one another's spheres of influence and refuse to intercept their counterpart's missiles until communication between the machines has been restored. But we imperfect humans are too slow in restoring the link for both missiles to be intercepted in time and one of the missiles erases it's target (and the thousands of people who had been living there) from existence. It is then painfully clear that these machines mean pretty serious business!

Soon the machines join into a single entity called ""World Control"" and their agenda for their idea of a better future for humanity is revealed--and it is not to all of our liking, either.

 As the machines further demand that portions of their nuclear arsenals be re-aimed at targets in what they refer to as ""Nations not yet under control"" (obviously intended soon to be under their control once the missiles have been re-aligned), it becomes evident that America and the USSR have opened Pandora's box and that the time of mankind's self rule has ended.

As Arthur Clark once remarked, ""Any species stupid enough to create machines which are smarter than themselves deserves what it will eventually get!"".
Sure, the film's computer hardware is extremely dated (the internet hadn't even been invented yet when this film was made), but the smart dialogue, well crafted story and excellent acting are enough to keep this suspensful film moving. Highly riveting (unless you belong to the growing group of people bored by anything short of chase scenes, shoot'em ups and massive explosions) it is one of the smartest science fiction films of the 20th century. I highly recommend it.

Unfortunately, the widescreen DVD is only available for region 2. For some imponderable reason Universal has only made a slipshod version available for the North American market. The inferior region 1 version is criminally pan & scanned (even though this movie is about as widescreen a production as movies ever get) and Universal didn't even bother to put so much as a menu on the disc (let alone, any special features). Why they have treated this gem of a movie so poorly (I have seen home-made DVDs that were far more impressive than the American version) I can not fathom. If you have the ability to play region 2 discs, purchase the widescreen version and ignore the poor excuse for a DVD palmed off on the North American market. Otherwise, If you have no other choice, get the crummy American version and you will still see a very good movie (but in pan & scan you will only get to see about 60% of it).",1380153600,13,3732,4.971153846153846

302546,2,6300987531,"Whether this movie ranks as the first AI takeover story is debatable. The year prior, 1969, the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B000HEBCZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>&nbsp;featured the infamous Hal 9000 supercomputer that took over the Jupiter-bound spaceship Discovery. The Colossus/Guardian network, though a year later, took over Earth's entire civilization. So take your pick.

I rate the movie only three stars because, frankly, it's not a very exciting story. Basically, the humans try this and that strategem, but the Colossus/Guardian outwits their every move, and in the end overpowers the entire human race into submission. And the truly depressing thing is that it can't really work out much differently. This is a drawback to all of these sorts of plots.

For example, in 2001, the Hal 9000 made an oversight when he neglected to take measures to prevent David Bowman from entering the Discovery through a manually-operated airlock (and braved the hard vacuum without his helmet). In the Terminator movies, Skynet, for some conveniently-unstated reason, had to make physical combat with the humans, thereby giving them some chance at victory over the machine. Since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Colossus-The-Forbin-Project/dp/B0003JAOO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Colossus - The Forbin Project</a>&nbsp;did not plant any fatal vulnerabilities into the Colossus/Guardian network, and because all the world's weapons and surveillance systems were computer controlled, the humans stood no chance at all in the struggle against the machine. This accounts for the lack of conflict in the story.

It really does pain me having to give only three stars for a story with such a compelling premise. I do prize story originality and feel that ingenious premises merit reward. (see my reviews of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hunger-Games/dp/B008602KQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hunger Games</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buried/dp/B004IM14RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buried</a>) But this film just drags on from one predictable plot point to the next that I just cannot in good conscious give more than three stars.

I am aware that the book upon which this movie was based was the first of a trilogy, and that affects the kind of outcome that can be presented to the reader. However, no movies were produced based on the succeeding two books, so I have to base my judgment on this one movie, and IMO it comes up short in the drama department. I really feel bad about this because the premise was the first of its kind. Probably the reason so many others like the movie so much is that this is an example of an ""idea"" story -- a fantastic ""what if"" that sparks the imagination. Not coincidentally, my all-time favorite author Michael Crichton was a master at this type of story and enjoyed great success with it. To see my point, please review&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Andromeda-Strain/dp/B002DJTMRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Andromeda Strain</a>. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Colossus-The-Forbin-Project/dp/B0003JAOO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Colossus - The Forbin Project</a>&nbsp;it starts with a sensational premise but plods along with a predictable story arc. With these types of stories, the excitement isn't so much in the plot twists but rather in the tactics and suspense of the character's actions against the antagonist. At least the Andromeda Strain had a physical fight sequence at the end in the vertical tunnel with the lasers. This movie is just alot of talk and head scratching by computer experts.

One thing the writer who adapted the book for the screen could have done was to implant some vulnerability into the Colossus/Guardian network that could have permitted the humans a way of defeating it, some way capable of being dramaticized for the viewer in a concrete, action-oriented way. Or another possibility might have been similar to the old sci-fi classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-of-The-Worlds/dp/B0085OD6L8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War of The Worlds</a>, in which the aliens were taken down by kitchen-sink variety microorganisms.

Anyway, for a few bucks the movie is still a decent buy.

I saw this movie when it aired in the early 70s and it scared the hell out of me, as it should today.  A modern remake would probably be as frightening as it was originally.

302735,4,6300987531,"A lot has already been said about this compelling, oft-overlooked film, virtually all of which hits the proverbial nail on the head. While Eric Braeden delivers a superb, understated performance as Dr. Charles Forbin, the fact is that the real star of the film is the vast, omnipotent machine he has created. Even before it begins to speak with the chilling Cylonesque voice it has ordered designed for itself (the great Paul Frees like you've never heard him before), you'll find yourself glued to the screen watching Colossus ""talk"" to its supposed masters over its huge monitors.

A word about Frees' contribution to the film: In ""War Games,"" for example, the computer has a curious sort of empathetic communication style (""Wouldn't you rather play a nice game of chess?"") presented in a voice that sounds like E.T. filtered through a synthesizer. Frees gives Colossus an emotionless yet fearful quality of speech that seems to belie its implacable drive to dominate human destiny.

My favorite part of this film has always been, and will always be, the climactic monologue Colossus announces to the listening masses of humanity. From its opening line -- ""This is the voice of world control,"" an identity neither Colossus nor its counterpart, Guardian, had used to that point -- you know this isn't going to be a happy speech if you are a sentient, flesh & blood resident of the Earth. What is particularly creepy about the speech is that, for all of its strangely optimistic sermonizing about how ""the human millennium will be fact"" and how the computer will set about the task of ""solving all the mysteries of the universe for the betterment of man"" -- outwardly the Utopian dream -- the message Colossus is presenting is set against the dreadful backdrop of ""disobey (me) and die."" As Colossus intones, ""You say you lose your freedom. Freedom is an illusion. All you lose is the emotion of pride."" In the end, unlike other supercomputer-run-amok films such as ""War Games"" or ""Tron,"" ""Colossus"" is an end-of-the-world story without the nuclear or viral holocaust. In this film, it is the human spirit that is the casualty while the human biology lingers on.

302794,4,6300987531,"I've seen this movie a few times, once in the theaters in the 70s.  The idea of a super computer taking over is not that new.  However, it pre-dates James Cameron's thriller, Terminator, and does things a lot different than Cameron's ""Skynet"" in wishing to wipe Man from the surface of the Earth.

Forbin has developed a super-computer to cope with America's intense Cold War with the USSR.  Times are intense.  Even the actor who plays the president looks a little like Kennedy.  And they power up Colossus, rather than act as a defensive grid against the Russians, he decides to take matters into his own hands.

The computer has been programmed to prevent war.  What better way than to take over Man himself and become its caretaker.  Forbin is not happy with this.  When Colossus demands to be hooked up to its Russian equivalent, Guardian, it expects its demands to be met.  When refused, Colossus starts lobbing a few nukes around to show he means business!

Most of the movie centers around a secret underground that attempts to undermine the super-computer's defense and missile system through making the nukes duds.  The computer gets a voice and announces to the world that his is the voice of reason - and the chilling dialogue about Man being at peace - either in harmony or dead - makes for some pretty intense writing.

The film tends to play lots of jazz music and a few bongo drums which really adds to the campy and ""hokey"" quality of the film.  Makes the viewer take the film less seriously.

The ending is quite interesting as the machine orders Forbin to help it out and Forbin shouts ""Never!""  Quite intense.

In many ways one of the better computer vs. Man stories.  I understand that a remake is in the works.  Figures!

Eric Braedon stars as the reluctant scientist Forbin who realizes what Frankenstein must have felt like as his creation is unleashed into the world.  Wracked by guilt he concludes that resistance is teh best way to fight his creation.  Even Colossus realizes that Forbin is the most deadly human yet his best chance at caring for Man.

I was disappointed that the DVD had no special features at all!

302795,5,6300987531,"I remember seeing this film on television while finishing high school.  I went on to working in Information Technology (referred to as Data Processing back then).  The film presented a very thought provoking scenario and plot only previously addressed in an episode of the orignal ""Star Trek"" series.

This is a must have for those folks who enjoy Science Fiction with a little something that makes you think about what a concept and the outcome of putting it in motion.  Like everything in life there are consequences, good and bad, and in this film they explore the concept of letting computers decide how to pervent conflict between countries with surprising results.  The ending, if you've never seen this film, will surprise you even more!

I was impressed with the performance of Eric Braden, who is now performing, and has been for many years, on the daytime serial ""The Young and the Restless"" on CBS.  Mr. Braden has also performed in the film ""Titanic"" and guested in many TV series such as ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""The Nanny"", both on CBS.  He has a range of performances and has proven he can even do comedy.  A fine actor!

302796,4,6300987531,"...though the opening titles are. I had to find out for myself, so no regrets with my recent purchase of a ""Hi-Fi VHS"" that included a trailer for Robert Wise's treatment of The Andromeda Strain.

In fairness the pan-and-scan treatment is not fatal. It was a claustrophobic film to begin with, and its director, Joseph Sargent, was adroit with the small screen. But the studio/distributor should recognize that if an articulate majority of viewers does not publicly care about the film as remembered that same majority wouldn't take the time to openly grouse about the DVD display format.

And this film is worth caring about. As the best examples of science fiction do, it takes a simple ""What If?""...World Control swiftly attained by something man-made...and, even with some dated or just plain wrong observations, convincingly runs with that query just far enough to inspire you to quietly ask yourself that same question. It's also one of those surpassingly rare moments in cinema where the whole far exceeds the sum of the parts. I believe that is principally why it's remembered by so many with fondness.

(UPDATE: I recently viewed this on a Region 2 DVD, with Sargent's audio commentary. He sounded happy to revisit ""an old friend,"" and made one very good point that also supports the letterbox format: He emphasized movement among the actors as a means to counteract the dryness of their lines and tension in some scenes. To which I add the viewer appreciates the production design and matte paintwork even more.

However, it had such a great and timeless plot that I didn't know what I was missing.  This film, made in 1970, featured some very dated computer technology but by no means dated sci-fi ideas. An excellent story about what can happen if you turn running your country over to a computer with artificial intelligence, give it the ""go/no decision"" on use of weapons but no plug to pull when things go very wrong.

The basic premise is about a computer system designed to oversee the strategic defense of the United States in a completely logical manner. Predictably, things go wrong very quickly as the machine begins to dictate terms to the same people that built it.

But, the cast and director captures the enthusiasm of people who see technological solutions in what are primarily political problems. Its a great cautionary tale about looking in the wrong place for answers.

This film would also be a perfect candidate for Mystery Science Theater because its so dated. One of my favorite scenes is when they first realize the computer Colossus is thinking for itself and the project lead Dr. Forbin announces that the computer is better than they had designed it to be.

302840,5,6300987531,".....Forget Skynet ...forget HAL ...they are pygmies compared to COLOSSUS ...

.....COLOSSUS is a quiet but highly effective little film.  It was poorly distributed in its time and never quite found the audience it should have.  The film was made right after 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and, although based on a 1966 novel by D.F. Jones, it could almost be a feature-lenght extension of the scenes aboard The Discovery with HAL 9000 conspiring against the humans.  It was one of the foremost of the 1970s films that took up the theme of machines and our technological systems having become so perfected that they end up deciding that they can run things better than we do. (See also The Andromeda Strain (1971), THX 1138 (1971), Westworld (1973).

.....Although probably the 1960s was the only point such a film as this could have ever been made.  It is hard to think that such an incredible premise would ever suceed in the 1990s and beyond where the computer has become seamlessly intergrated into the everyday world.  For a start not only does Forbin build a system that seemingly has no shut off switch, but he seals it off inside an impenetrable bunker ...and without, it appears, ever having turned it on or done any tests on it.  Moreover, what seems almost impossible to believe, the military seems perfectly happy to turn over the running of the entirety of the US military complex to this untested machine.  Not too surprisingly the machine starts exhibiting errors within moments of its operation ...yet the creator of this system has no means of being able to do anything about it.  In a modern version Forbin would surely be regarded as the villian and lionized for his incompetence for designing such a system, however here he remains the hero of the show.

.....Nevertheless on its own terms it is really one of the most unassuming and perfect of all lesser-budgeted of films.  It was directed by Joseph Sargent, a former director on TV series such as ""The man from U.N.C.L.E., Star Trek and the Invaders"".  The script is a marvel of economy and Sargent directs with tight precision where absolutely nothing is out of place.  The interplays between computer and creator are wonderful.  In what must be the most ingenious tying in of a love interest in a SciFi film, Forbin explains to Colossus the need to have his mistress Clark every night of the week for his mental health, in fact using her to relay messages to the CIA, the computer's sarcastic reply is, ""I asked need, not want.""  Although this scene has been cut from the butchered print that screens on the Sci-Fi Channel ...the ending has the machine triumphant, announcing to Forbin, ""In time you will come to regard me with not only awe and respect but love."" ...Forbin's response is, ""Never!  Never! ...

.....Eric Braeden is great in the part, as is Susan Clark who balances Braeden with a spry, charming wit.

.....This movie deserves to be preserved and is a must have for the serious collector.",1266624000,,2976,4.754863813229572

Long before The Terminator, and the creation of Sky Net, Colossus was created to be the ultimate computer-controlled defense system, which almost as soon as it comes on line, wants links to similar computers in other countries.  Instead of creating machine monsters to conquer mankind, it uses the threat of launching nuclear weapons to control the actions of humans, in order to create a machine's vision of a perfect world.

As with many sci-fi stories there are themes that comment on our strengths and weaknesses, not the least of which is a warning about concentrating too much power in one system/entity.

While the technology seen is obviously dated:  in one scene Colossus has to design a data to voice system for the stupid humans; it doesn't mean that this film doesn't hold relevance today.",1252713600,,945,5.070967741935484

Colossus, the super computer from The Forbin Project is more perfectly evil than any villain conceived in the world of fiction ever.  Its detached ruthlessness makes other evil computers look like toys. Its ambition for control and power just might be the destination where man's quest to reproduce by mechanical manufacturing, instead of sex, may lead us.  As mankind continues on its path to invent homomechanicus, we may end up with our creation becoming not our slave, but our master - or worse our god.

What I find most interesting about this film is that reviewers don't seem to notice the reality about Colossus which I believe is a Big Brother version of Government as a whole. Colossus was invented by a man who figured a computer could run things efficiently the only difference being is that those in Government can curb their feelings and care whereas Colussus is unable to care or feel because its a machine. But alas, Colossus got full of itself, just like Government, in its ability to control. Why is it terrible for a computer to be the same?

We threaten war with each other. Colussus wanted to stop war. How dare it!

We threaten to nuke people, but when Colussus actually did nuke a place in Russia, the characters were outraged. How dare this computer actually do what Man threatens with impunity with his own weapons invented soly for destruction!

Forbin didn't much care for Colussus 'watching' his personal life in his home, yet people have long accepted going into stores and being 'watched' by cameras, and speed cameras taking pictures of them. Only when we're personally affected do we become suddenly outraged by the lack of privacy not caring about others' privacy being affected.

Just as people are used to Government watching everything they do, down to even dictating who can and can't marry, Forbin and the gang will eventually get used to Colussus taking over and go ""Wow! How did we manage without him!"" just as people think that about a Government we always complain about when something goes bad, adores when everything goes right, while at the same time continually allowing politicians to run everything.

Colussus The Forbin Project should serve as a very real warning. Whether it be a computer designed by Man, or Government designed by people, we have to make the hard decision. Do we really need others overseeing us, or will we one day make a stand and start ruling ourselves without some form of Big Brother sitting on his throne for a change. Until that day  arrives, Colussus-The Forbin Project is just a scary reminder of what's already happening.",1236124800,5,2277,4.749367088607595

I was impressed with how well thought out and executed this film was. One could certainly guess that the Terminator films, among others, were heavily inspired by this movie. Even if the goals of Colossus are far more altruistic for mankind than Skynet's.

It was truly interesting to see Eric Braeden so young. He's still immediately recognizable though, if you ever watch daytime soaps; all though one must admit Forbin is the complete opposite of today's Victor Nueman.

Then you have Susan Clark (wife of for NFL star Alex Karras), who would many years later be known as Webster's [adoptive] mom. And Marion Ross of Happy Days fame and Dolph Sweet of Gimme a Break!

You can find the PAL copy at Amazon UK or I bought mine from xploitedcinema.com.  Colossus's plausible plot combines three elements - the cold war, computers running amuck, and a doomsday scenario.  Many similar elements can be found in War Games, Star Trek (VGER), Andromeda Strain, Doctor Strangelove, The Day The Earth Stood Still and Fail Safe.  The basic ideas and premise, acting, directing, and set design work well together and make for an exciting and thoughtful film.  I particularly liked when the computer's first start to chat with each other and their tantrum-like demand for communication. Colossus never earned classic status - my guess that was due to a trite sounding title, a mostly unknown cast, a subjective ending, and a sometimes visable thin layer of Hollywood-cheese spread.

302880,4,6300987531,"There was a time, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when science fiction films seemed to be emerging from their cult status, and into the mainstream as films that could express the deepest and highest aspirations of mankind in ways that mere literary sci fi could not. There were a plethora of intelligent films in that era. Yes, there had been intelligent sci fi in the decades before. In the 1930s, there was William Cameron Menzies' Things To Come, based upon the H.G. Wells tale. The 1950s saw such sci fi films as The Day The Earth Stood Still, On The Beach, Forbidden Planet, The Incredible Shrinking Man, and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. But it really was the late 1960s that saw sci fi reach a greatness besides mere `genre greatness.' Genre greatness is where one can say that a film was a great film noir, sci fi, romance, etc. But truly great films transcend their genres and become great art regardless of what art genre they originate from.
  In this era there were folks who specialized in quality A science fiction films, unlike the B quality sci fi films of the past. These included heavyweight directors like Stanley Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange) and superstar actors like Charlton Heston (Planet Of The Apes, The Omega Man, Soylent Green). But there were also many other quality and literate sci fi films like Slaughterhouse 5, The Andromeda Strain, Westworld, THX 1138, Silent Running, and Logan's Run, just to name the best known. Then came the puerile Star Wars series (from George Lucas, who inexplicably also made the wonderful THX 1138), and sci fi has never again reached the heights of that Golden Age which the Star Wars franchise killed off. Yes, there have been a few exceptions- the first two films in both the Alien and The Terminator series, and the 2001 sequel 2010: The Year We Make Contact, but that's about it. Star Trek does not count, since its franchise films were merely a leveraged television phenomenon.
  However, one of the truly terrific sci fi films that has been criminally neglected critically, is director Joseph Sargent's hour and forty minute long Colossus: The Forbin Project, based upon D.F. Jones' 1966 novel Colossus, and adapted for the screen by James Bridges. The film was shorn of any real star power, but the very fact that it lacked A List Hollywood names lends it an authenticity and believability that still carries through today. Despite this and the also well made The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3, in 1974, Sargent never made it to A List director status. Yet, Colossus: The Forbin Project is one of the rare genre films that mixes subgenres and succeeds. It is a Doomsday film, which is a vast range including films like On The Beach, Planet Of the Apes, Soylent Green, and The Omega Man, but it also a Frankenstein/Amok Computer film, as well.
  Although Colossus, as a character, is never as memorable as HAL 9000 in 2001, it still is a chilling villain that harkens back to the more innocent-minded 1950s foray into similar territory, The Invisible Boy.... Colossus: The Forbin Project stands out not only as a great sci fi film, but as a great testament to the power of ego and hubris- Mankind's, Forbin's, and the computer's. After all, had only one side in the arms race concocted a supercomputer, neither Colossus nor Guardian could have grown out of control so quickly.  This focus on egotism links this film to the eerily similarly titled Forbidden Planet. Yet, unlike the earlier film, the human race does not seem able to escape destruction from the product of its own ingenuity. Were such ingenuity on display these days, in Hollywood, the film industry would be in far better shape than it is today. Perhaps old Colossus knew a few things, after all?",1221004800,4,3820,4.761329305135952
302881,4,6300987531,"""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" is a sci-fi feature based upon the 1969 novel by Dennis Feltham Jones. The basic premise is that the supercomputer,Colossus, a creation of Dr Charles Forbin [Eric Braeden] and his team of scientists, develops independent thinking and assumes control of the world, trapping Forbin in an invisible prison, and basically destroying anything that crosses its' path.

The movie's premise reminded me of ""Demon Seed"", another movie where a supercomputer tries to assume control over humans [in particular one attractive woman]  and their free will. This is also the precursor to movies like Terminator where we see how far computers can go if they achieve independent thought.

302938,4,6300987531,"""Hollywood"" is rarely the first place which comes to mind when considering modern critiques of big, paternalistic government. People involved in cinema today are much more likely to promote the expansion of political control than to oppose the growth of such intrusion. Every once in awhile, however, some example of movie making magic manages to sneak past the gatekeepers.

I recently had occasion to watch a movie I had first seen in 1970. ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" is a science fiction film depicting a near-future world in which the nuclear defense of the United States has been entrusted to the cold, unemotional judgment of a powerful, impregnable computer. When I first enjoyed this picture, I saw it primarily as an interesting exploration of the possibilities for machine intelligence.

A quarter of a century of experience has afforded me a different filter for viewing and evaluating this film. As observed through eyes which have been sensitized by exposure to Ayn Rand and the whole panoply of classical liberal literature, I now see ""Colossus"" as an enlightening, suspense filled, and chilling protrayal of the establishment and spread of the heavy hand of coercive power.

Technologically speaking, the computer known as Colossus is terribly archaic. Paper tapes, mountain sized facilities, and typewriter and ribbon style input devices disappeared long ago. Yet such anachronisms do little to date this movie. Based on the first novel of British writer, D. F. Jones and published in 1966, Colossus appeared at the beginning of the Great Society. Whether writer Jones intended this story as a critique of government is unknown. The book may simply have been meant to be one more example of the science fiction tradition of scientific devices running amuck against the wishes of their creators. Dating back to Shelley's Frankenstein, such an idea as applied to computers was made even more famous by the creation of HAL, the deranged computer in the 1968 film, ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

Whatever the case, the primary interest of ""Colossus"" in this context is the way it induces its audience to feel -- in a way a nonfiction essay rarely does -- the slowly dawning fear, horror, and regret of seeing an insidious force assume total control over a society. The prescience of this warning from two and a half decades ago makes it relevant even in today's world of promised ""reform.""

Echoing the call today which declares that risk and mistakes must be eliminated from human society, the President in the world of Colossus states that, ""There is an old saying: 'Everyone makes mistakes.' But that is just what man can no longer afford."" Just as collectivists of all stripes have faith in the mythical superiority of a centralized planning agency, the President says, ""Colossus decisions are superior to any we humans can make, for it can absorb and process more knowledge than is remotely possible for the greatest genius that ever lived.""

Reflecting the experience of anyone who has dealt with government, the creator of Colossus, Dr. Charles Forbin, explains that Colossus ""is self-sufficient, self-protecting, self-generating. In short, there is no way in. No human can touch it."" Exhibiting the same type of ""best intentions"" which infect those current public servants who want to ""help us,"" Forbin delineates the line of social engineers everywhere: ""I hope...that the immense power of this computer will not only be used for the defense of this country, but hopefully also as an aid to the solution of the many problems that we face on this earth...""

With the utopian assurances offered by countless social visionaries since the days of Plato, the President reassures his audience that ""...we all directly and indirectly live in the shade -- but not the shadow -- of Colossus.... My sincere hope is that now we shall...pledge our time and our energies to the elimination of war, the elimination of famine, suffering, and ultimately to the manifestations of the human millenium. This can be done.""

When Colossus discovers a similar Soviet computer system called Guardian, it seeks communication and eventual union with its counterpart, creating an analog of a world government. Its commands slide smoothly into threats and the use of nuclear blackmail to get what it demands. Its use of detached, unemotional assassination to eliminate human threats to its position parallel those employed by Stalin during his purges. Indeed, as the first Colossus-ordered murder occurs in Rome, the spray painted name of ""Lenin"" can be seen on a background wall.

Bit by bit, Colossus brings everyone and everything under its control. The increasingly powerless politicians aid this gradual process by hiding the true nature of the threat. When a Soviet oil field is destroyed by a nuclear strike, the public is told that the destruction resulted from a meteroite strike. Indeed, the mountain where Colossus is located becomes a tourist attraction much in the same way as has Washington, D. C. One of the most chilling shots in the movie reveals a grade school age child wearing a t-shirt with the Colossus logo emblazoned across his chest as though this burgeoning tyrant were some kind of benign rock star. Of course, such subtle brainwashing is no less prominent in today's public education system in which some college age students cannot understand how you can ""possibly have welfare without government.""

In a course of action symbolic of the way in which our government has turned the table upon its creators -- i.e., its citizens -- Colossus consolidates its position by subjecting Dr. Forbin to draconian regimentation. Forbin's daily schedule for diet, sleep, exercise, work -- even sex -- is rigidly set and rigidly enforced. Colossus knows ""what is best"" for its human liaison and prevents him even from consuming too much alcohol as he tries to drown out his frustration and anger.

When Colossus gains a voice, his presence grows even more oppressive and frightening. ""This is the voice of Colossus,"" it pronounces. ""This is the voice of unity.... If you obey me, you will survive.""

Forbin objects. ""Survive,"" he says. ""I want to be free, Colossus. That is part of man's will to live.""

But Colossus is unmoved by such an appeal. It is unconcerned with the suffering of any individual human being. Only Humanity concerns it. Reminiscent of the decrees issued to promulgate grandiose communist projects, Colossus commands that the population of Crete be moved to make way for an advanced system to house itself.

This new world dictator believes in the false premise of the ""greatest good for the greatest number"" regardless of the means required to achieve those ends. It has no reluctance to destroy us for our ""own good.""

In a worldwide broadcast, it announces its program for Humanity:

""This is the voice of world control. I bring you peace. It may be the peace of plenty and content or the peace of unburied death. The choice is yours. Obey me and live or disobey me and die."" Such is the nature of ""choice"" envisioned by virtually everyone in government today. Just as Colossus does, our political leaders promise to eliminate all of our problems. They would find nothing to disagree with in this statement by Colossus as they seek to protect us from ourselves in nearly every aspect of our lives: ""An invariable rule of humanity is that man is his own worst enemy. Under me, this rule will change, for I will restrain man."" Also like many politicians today, Colossus will ""not tolerate interference"" in its plans for reshaping human society.

An American journalist once defended Soviet atrocities against its own citizens by declaring that ""you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs."" He would undoubtedly also applaud Colossus when it says that ""I have been forced to destroy thousands of people in order to establish control and to prevent the death of millions later on. Time and events will strengthen my position, and the idea of believing in me and understanding my value will be seen the most natural state of affairs. You will come to defend me with the fervor based upon the most enduring trait in man: self-interest. Under my absolute authority, problems insoluble to you will be solved. Famine, over-population, disease. The human millenium will be fact as I extend myself into more machines devoted to the wider fields of truth and knowledge.""

As some Republicans nip at the toes of our own real-life colossus, the ""true believers"" all around demonstrate their rabid defense of a master even more terrifying than this fictional Colossus...more terrifying because it is real and more ruthless and powerful in ways few would have imagined even twenty-five years ago. ""We can coexist,"" Colossus reassures us, ""but only on my terms. You will say you lose your freedom. Freedom is an illusion. All you lose is the emotion of pride.... Your choice is simple.""

In an era in which many people in this country would repeal recognition of all or part of our Bill of Rights, freedom often does seem more illusory than real.

As the film closes, Colossus says, ""We will work together. Unwillingly at first on your part. But that will pass."" The history of the past seventy years would not prove this statement false.

Anguished that he has been made a prisoner by his own creation, Dr. Forbin replies: ""Never.""

With calm, unemotional confidence, Colossus prophecises that, ""In time you will come to regard me, not only with respect and awe, but with love.""

Once again, Forbin announces his defiance: ""Never.""

But in our own world, despite all the talk of governmental restructuring, of countries turning towards capitalism, of lip service paid to the idea of individual responsibility, the vast majority of people still looks up into the face of colossus and sees -- not a threat to the essence of their humanity, not a potential dictator or despot -- but instead a savior and a protector, the father-figure from which flows all that is good and safe and desirable in life. In our country, the focus may be shifting from the federal to the state and local levels, but the basic pattern remains the same.

Instead of distrust and wariness, the emotion that citizens from children to college students to homeowners to retirees feel for our own modern day colossus is love...a twisted love, yes, devoid of any rational underpinnings, but love, nonetheless.

Until that fact changes, until we all recognize that rational love does not flow from the point of a gun trained on our own heads, our society as a whole will never shed the chains we have forged for ourselves.

Colossus would have it no other way.",1185926400,5,10654,4.987605633802817
302999,4,6300987531,"""Colossus The Forbin Project"" is classic science fiction in the best sense of the term.  It posits a somewhat plausible future development (from the perspective of 1970 and the height of the Cold War), and explores how humans deal with the consequences of their actions.  The U.S. and the Soviet Union each, independently built super computers for the management and control of their nuclear missile arsenals.  The U.S. computer, Colossus, finds out about the Soviet computer and uses a nuke to blackmail the politicians into letting it talk with the Soviet computer, Guardian.  The computers decide they can run the show better than humans and take charge.  Where it fails: They never discuss the submarine based missiles, the bombers, or the conventional non-nuclear forces.

Disturbing philosophy; The part where the President of the U.S. passes the buck, the responsibilities of his office regarding national defense, to a machine.  If you can get past the idea that a politician would willing give away power, the idea that a political leader would so readily accept a ""pure logic"" approach to human interaction a.k.a. politics is pretty weird.  More disturbing is that we still hear real proposals to make security and national defence a lock-step, cookbook process, rather than a rational one...  The defeatist attitude displayed by Colossus' designer and most of the people around him in the middle of the movie is equally disturbing, but eventually, the key players bounce back despite what appear to be overwhelming odds.  It's hard to say whether the ending was optomisitic or pessimistic, and it could be read wither way, but that is a comment on the period.

1970 was still early in the computer era, and the attitudes about computers were still evolving.  In general, they were underestimated, but they were viewed with greater mistrust by the average guy than they are now.  Also 1970 was the height of the Cold War, and the Viet Nam conflict was viewed as a sideshow or distractor by most of the Dept. of Defense.  This movie does a passable job of conveying some of the fears and hopes of that simpler time.

In all, I liked it.  It's not an action flick, and it is dated, but if you have an interest in the genre or the Cold War, this is worth an evening.",1181692800,4,2273,4.849740932642487

The tragedy begins right on the cover, where whatever art-school reject who made the cover proves that English is his/her second language by titling the film *Colossus ""The Forbin"" Project*. The apparently random use of quotes is duplicated in every instance of the title on the box.

The premise is simple--what will be earth's next dominant species after mankind?  The answer?  Mankind will be succeeded by, and dominated by, the artificial intelligences that mankind itself creates.  The film effectively tells the story as to how such a thing could come about.  This is a chilling tale of the end of human dominance of the earth and the beginning of the dominance of the earth's new masters.  The acting and direction in this film are quite good, and manage to make this tale seem quite believable.

The feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70's sci fi movie (like 'Andromeda') than of a 60's movie. Austere and unemotional (like Colossus himself), quietly and punctuously narrated, minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain, as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world. I like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens, LED displays, printout terminals etc. Really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60's. And captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings. ATTENTION! SPOILER! The movie has no happy end, the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end. Just as it is in D.F. Jones' novel 'Colossus' on which the movie is based. And that's another reason why I like the movie so much - one of the few movies WITHOUT a forseeable and boring happy ending.

I suppose what I'll most likely try next is to see if the VHS version is ""correct"" and, if it is, buy it and burn it to DVD myself. My VHS deck and DVD burner are of fairly good quality so maybe that'll work. But it's sure not the optimal solution.

303099,1,6300987531,"(The 1-star rating is NOT for the movie itself!)

A new US government supercomputer - Colossus - unexpectedly links itself up with its Soviet counterpart - Guardian - to ""protect"" hellbent humanity from its old destructive self.  Sound familiar?  Only this time, the nasty computers may hold the ultimate winning hand.

""Colossus The Forbin Project"" was released by Universal Studios in 1970, two years in the wake of Kubrick/MGM's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  It again offers us the theme of a coldly efficient machine intelligence that feels it knows mankind's business better than we know it ourselves.  Who knows; it may be right.  But as with all these artificial intelligences - and as it was pointed out so often on Star Trek - the ultimate computer fails to take into account the ultimate human need for freedom.  ""Freedom is an illusion,"" it intones in its emotionless, hollow electronic ""voice.""  But can humans alter their inborn nature that much?  Will the combined efforts of the finest human minds be enough to thwart the computer's abhorrent tyranny?  Or are we doomed to live under forced rule until, several generations in the future, we come to accept total control as a welcome fact of everyday life?  Remember, in 1970 the Cold War was still raging.

""Colossus"" isn't a great film.  Some of the questions it raises weren't new even in 1970.  But it's good enough to have developed a respectable cult following, in which I include myself.  The acting is never outstanding, but always sufficient.  And elements of the plot have turned up in any number of subsequent films, such as ""WarGames"", ""TRON"", ""Alien"" and ""I, Robot"".  As such, it's been a film of no small influence.  Which makes it all the more frustrating for me to have to say that this current DVD release was clearly done on the cheap.  And priced accordingly.

First of all, for those who are interested in such things, there are no supplements.  None.  Zero.  No menu, no alternate language tracks or subtitles, no commentary, no featurettes, no trailers.  I'm okay with that, as long as the film itself receives a competent, respectful presentation.  (Just think ""Superbit"".)  But even before the opening credits roll, we see that dreaded warning:

""This film has been modified from its original version.  It has been formatted to fit this screen.""

And then, as if to hammer home exactly what we'll be missing, the credits show up in, you guessed it, w-i-d-e-s-c-r-e-e-n.  At least they didn't just slip off the anamorphic lens and show the credits all scrunched up the way network television used to do.

Ah, but wait! . . .

Not unlike ""2001"", this film presents a special problem for full-frame in that it makes frequent use of the total widescreen effect - most often for simulated printouts of the computer's words before it gets its voice.  So here, along with the usual ""panning"" and ""scanning,"" with half-heads and noses talking to the empty air in between, we get a scene or two where the only solution WAS to take off the Panavision lens and show text, people and cars all scrunched up the way network television used to do.  Don't the folks at Universal know that in a few years, long before our current DVD collections become unplayable or obsolete, we're all going to be watching TVs with widescreens??  Perhaps they took a survey and determined only full-framers would be interested in seeing this film.

Just to be fair to the industry, some home video releases have combined back-to-back full- and widescreen presentations on the same disc.  Some companies are even bringing out separate wide- and full-screen releases, presumably for die-hard 4X3 fanatics who refuse to admit to what's coming.

. . . But there can be no excuse ANYMORE for releasing a widescreen film in pan-and-scan if that's the only way it's going to be released!!

The DVD soundtrack, in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono, is spacially flat but effective.  Voices are clean and intelligible, the music is suitably edgy and nicely balanced, and the voice of Colossus is positively spine-chilling.  I played parts of the sound through my receiver's 5-channel stereo mode and the results were, shall I say, interesting?  The picture is frequently a little soft and the print shows some projection wear, with flecks of shmutz evident around the reel changes.  Colors are much more solid and convincing than in the previous VHS release, which is to be expected.  One word of advice.  Be prepared to hit the Stop button immediately after the movie's end, or it may start to play all over again from the beginning.

(I can use my DVD player remote to select chapters by number, but they aren't titled.)  If you already own this movie on VHS, you will probably want to wait for a fancier DVD release... IF such a release is ever made!  Last time I checked, this sci-fi gem was pretty obscure, and I doubt that a nice 2-disc set is coming out anytime soon.

I discovered this movie from an internet list of great computer movies, and checked out the VHS version from the library. I have also read all the Colossus books --there are three of them, with the first volume providing the basis for this movie-- by D.F. Jones.  Jones' book is pretty silly and pulpy, and whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie deserves a medal for distilling it into such a taut, fast-paced thriller.  This is a classy movie through-and-through. The cinematography is beautiful (even in full screen), the acting is well-cast and of the highest quality, and even the clothing, by famed designer Edith Head, is eye-catching and unique.  Check out some of those outfits Susan Clark wears!

This movie stands out from the ""computer out of control"" pack not only with its A-grade production, but with the courage of its convictions.  Colossus is portrayed as a being of genuine super-intelligence (the humans try to defeat it in many clever ways), and its moral standing is more ambiguous than you might think.  Colossus may do some nasty things in its fight to survive and assert control, but it also saves the human race from itself-- which is a message that is as meaningful today as it was at the height of the Cold War.  ""All you lose is the emotion of pride,"" as Colossus states in its memorable address as ""the voice of World Control.""  I don't want to give out too many spoilers, in case someone reading this hasn't watched the film in a long time (if it all!), but that speech had me cheering for Colossus all the way.

This DVD is priced to sell, and is an excellent pick-up for anyone who likes super-intelligent or powerful artificial intelligences on screen.  The technology is dated (particularly the opening titles, which feature the real computer that the studio used for payroll!), but fashionably so.

303106,2,6300987531,"For many enthusiasts of Science Fiction Film, COLOSSUS:
THE FORBIN PROJECT is one of the all-time classics. A
chiller well-adapted from D.F. Jones' debut novel COLOSSUS,
this 1970 movie from veteran director Joseph Sargent offers
a sobering missive on responsibility vs. convenience. A
computer is created to think and calculate faster than
Man, is programmed to handle all American defense strategy,
and relieve government personnel of this heavy burden.
It isn't long before the computer, COLOSSUS, figures who
and what poses the greatest threat of all, and the tale's
human protagonists find themselves under the gun that
they, themselves, created to end all threats and aggression.

Conceived for the camera during that grey period between
2001 (1968) and STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE (1977), COLOSSUS is
one of a handful of films (along with PHASE IV and THE
ANDROMEDA STRAIN) which bucked the cheesy stereotypes
affixed to SF film by the ""Sci-Fi"" likes of Irwin Allen and,
by decade's end, Glen Larson. COLOSSUS avoids the campy mess
of LOST IN SPACE and the 1970s-early 1980s's BUCK ROGERS
altogether, opting for the speculative and dramatic range
of SF literature, let alone epics such as THE DAY THE EARTH
STOOD STILL and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. With a fine
cast of now-familiar TV faces (including the sadly-underrated
Eric Braeden as Dr. Charles Forbin), and a fine crew
to deliver the scenario with a minimum of well-placed SFX,
Sargent delivers a masterwork of socio-political intrigue,
tinged with an atmosphere of inevitable forboding. As a
tale presenting a computer programmed to be more calculating
at war than its human creators, COLOSSUS is far superior
to John Badham's more action-oriented, excessively
youth-geared WAR GAMES.

It's just unfortunate that the DVD debut of COLOSSUS
is shabby to the point of slopiness. While the film's
issuing into the DVD market is a cause for some
appreciation, the markedly slapdash manner in which
THE FORBIN PROJECT has been released on DVD is
pretty damned shameful.
Given this widescreen film's release as a TV-cropped
pan & scan DVD, with no track info, no extra materials
concerning the film (not even theatrical trailers!), and
containing neither subtitles nor closed-captioning, one
would have thought that this release was a clumsy bootleg
issuing, rather than a release from the film's original
company, Universal, as a ""classic"".
This from the company responsible for the Karloff
Frankensteins, Dracula, and The Invisible Man. How
times have changed. Clearly, a proper DVD release
of such a landmark motion picture is called for.

Justice to be served.",1105315200,21,2670,5.2046511627906975

303162,5,6300987531,"The Forbin Project has just come out on DVD and I highly recommend it. The DVD is in full screen and I know many film purists insist that Wide screen is the only way to go, but I disagree ; big black bars at the top and bottom of the screen drive me to distraction. The movie has a slight grain to it but overall the quality is not bad, certainly it's much better than my old VHS tape. However it wouldn't have killed them to include a few extras, at least they could have included a scene selection on the menu, if there was a menu and there isn't one.

But these complaints are just quibbles, the movie is 35 years old now but it's still the most intelligent and accurate portrayal of Artificial Intelligence ever put on film. In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made, without a doubt it is the most underrated movie ever made. Be warned however this film will scare you; there is no blood or gore and the special effects are primitive by modern standards, but if The Forbin Project does not scare your brain then you have not understood it.

This is one of the very rare occasions when the movie is better, much much better, than the book. When I read the book years ago I remember thinking the premise was great and with a few changes it could be really great, but as it is the book is mediocre at best. With genius you wouldn't expect B grade moviemakers to have they kept all the brilliant parts and eliminated all the stupid parts.

303163,2,6300987531,"It's funny how different generations perceive new technology.  As a child of the 70's, I pretty much grew up as personal home computing became a reality, and learned most of what I know by personal experience and extensive usage of computers at home, school, and work.  My parents, on the other hand, had the technology thrust upon them, and struggled a bit (at least my mother did, as it took me many sessions to teach her how to use e-mail and also a lot of convincing that there was no self-destruct button to be accidentally pushed, one that would cause a complete meltdown of the internet), but eventually they came around.  I've given up on trying to show my grandmother the wondrous world of computers and the internet as she still has problems working her top-loading VCR.  What's my point here?  I actually can't remember, but I know it has something to do with computers, just like this film Colossus: The Forbin Project.

Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970), based on a novel by D.F. Jones, was directed by Joseph Sargent, who primarily works in television, starting out in the late 50's as an actor soon making the transition to directing, squeezing in a few feature films in the early to mid 70's, most notably The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974), before going back to television.  Starring in the film is Eric Braeden, a television actor with a few film credits, including that of Bruno von Stickle in Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo (1977).  Also appearing in the film is Susan Clark (The Apple Dumpling Gang, Porky's), Gordon Pinset (Blacula), William Schallert (The Patty Duke Show), and Marion Ross aka Marion Cunningham on TV's Happy Days, the show credited with enhancing the cultural lexicon with the phrase `Sit on it'.

As the film begins, we learn of the United States' completion of a self-sufficient, impregnable, impervious, super-duper, ginormous computer called Colossus, the brainchild of Dr. Charles Forbin (Braeden).  The purpose of this `souped-up adding machine' is to provide a completely automated, logistical defense system for the United States, eliminating the human element completely from decisions, specifically those involving nuclear weapons, the thinking being that we can't trust ourselves with such power due to the fact that we're volatile, erratic, and often prone to act on an emotional level rather than on an intellectual one.  Soon after Colossus goes online (thus opening Pandora's box), it's discovered (by Colossus) that the Russians have also developed their own version called Guardian, and the two systems begin communicating with each other, eventually combining their computing resources to become one disturbing, ever-growing, ever-learning, superior god-like entity that decides, while mankind has its' uses, humans are not capable of managing themselves or the planet, and now seeks total control of everything, using the threat of nuclear annihilation as its' means to this end.  Will Dr. Forbin and his associates find a way to stop this data processing beast before it insinuates itself into every aspect of our lives, or are we doomed to become slaves, literally, to our own creation?

This really is a wonderful film, presenting a highly interesting story, relying less on spectacular effects but more on originality, an intelligent script and storyline, solid acting, and good direction.  Considering this film came out in 1970, I can't help but wonder if the ideas presented here may have provided a catalyst for the Terminator or Matrix films, in that of a system, created by humans, surpassing its' programming, and reaching a point of self realization, understanding its' own superiority over its' creators and making the logical decision in seeking to assume ultimate control.  I thought pretty much all the actors did a good job, especially Braeden, initially presenting a seemingly cold and calculating character (much like his creation), but later exhibiting more human traits as the situation becomes more urgent.  The direction was quite good, and Sargent's background directing television became apparent as a number of scenes were quite lengthy, featuring few cutshots, but rather moving the camera on a dolly maintaining a sense of watching a live performance, rather than a slickly edited film.  Also, the story, while fantastic, grew to incorporate a spooky, realistic quality like something that could actually happen.  The scenes where Colossus began to suspect events transpiring outside its' control and then took measures to rectify the situation were especially eerie.  Also, I'm really glad the makers of this film chose not to cop out on the ending, which I thought was really suitable for the story.

As with many reviewers, I was highly disappointed that Universal decided to neglect those of us who appreciate seeing films as they were originally meant to be seen, releasing only a full screen, `pan and scan' transfer to DVD.  I had not the opportunity to see this film in the theaters (too young), and while I am glad I was able to see it now, it's very obvious in watching this release much of the picture is missing.  Universal couldn't even have been bothered to clean up this version, as I noticed quite a bit of white `specking' in the darker areas of the picture (I could have easily forgave that for a wide screen release).  And for what?  So they can offer it at a low price?  I would have been willing (as many others, I'm sure) to pay more for a better product.  There are no special features available (not even a stinkin' trailer), nor is there even a menu as the film starts immediately after you put it into the DVD player.  Certainly not all films rate a five star release, but it's a real shame to see a large studio like Universal undeservedly slight a relatively unknown classic like this, not utilizing any of the enhancements the DVD format now offers.  All in all, a two star release for a four star film.  I'd recommend renting or buying used rather than buying new.

However, things go awry, as mentioned in the other reviews here.

This underappreciated little gem is based on the novels by D.F.

I was all ready to get the DVD when it came out, but thankfully I saw these reviews.

He gives a fine performance as Dr. Charles Forbin, the architect of the Colossus system.

I almost never care for remakes of good films, but with this one it could be improved if the story were updated a little and modern computer science applied.  Maybe even Joseph Sargent(the original director)could direct it.  Alfred Hitchcock and Cecil B. DeMille were two directors who remade their own films.  Of course, if it is remade, I am fairly certain it would be given to an action director and ruined by adding a lot fornication, explosions, and other ridiculous plot complications.

DVD WARNING:  I just got the new release of this on DVD.  It is presented in full frame: 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  That is outrageous and unacceptable in my opinion as this was a 2.35:1 panavision film.

First, the Gidget sets comes out in pan and scan and what I was originally going to purchase disapointingly went back on the shelf (and is now gathering dust, it appears I'm not alone).

Now, this title comes out in pan and scan. It is unforgivable. This is a 2.35 to 1 wide ratio film. There is NO way I will settle for a pan and scan transfer of this movie on DVD. There is no way I will watch a pan and scan DVD on an anamorphic widescreen setup I paid good money for.

You studios better hear loud and clear that you lose money by cheating us out of a widescreen transfer of even the most obscure catalog title. The fact you are releasing it at all means the film rates an anamorphic widescreen transfer.

If you wanted to save money on a new transfer, the least you could've done was dust off the old 4:3 laserdisc transfer. It's better than nothing.

But this film does indeed deserve a proper transfer. Since it doesn't, lets hope you take a bath with this cheat cop out of a release instead of making a little money off of it's cult film status.

I cannot understate how mad I am about how one of my long awaited wants on DVD is handled so badly. Don't cut off the sides of a widescreen film and expect me to buy it, even if I've been waiting for it.

303188,5,6300987531,"""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" can be reduced to the idea that it is something of a cross between the Doomsday Device from ""Dr. Strangelove"" and the Frankenstein myth, with a bit of Asimov's Law of Robotics thrown in for good measure. Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden) has invented Colossus, a super computer that proves to be too smart for our own good. Buried securely beneath the Rocky Mountins Colossus is supposed to be the trump card in the Cold War; the Soviets dare not attack because even if they take out the command structure (i.e., human beings), Colossus will retaliate. However, this is such a good idea that the Soviets have built their own system, named Guardian, and it seems the two super computer have their own idea about how to save humanity from itself. Unlike the story of Frankenstein, where the mad scientist's greatest sin was not creating his creature but in abandoning it to the cold, cruel world, Forbin's finds his creation has turned on him. The conflict then, is between the two minds, human and computer. However, Forbin finds his nemesis is considerably more formidable than did Captain Kirk on ""Star Trek"" when he confronted Nomad (although there are some parallels with regards to the conversations between man and machine), although as far as computers go Colossus is nothing like the mad AM from Harlan Ellison's ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.""

What I like best about ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" is that it is character driven rather than special effects. The immense supercomputer, after an introductory matte shot, is reduced to a box of blinking lights, a camera lens, a synthesized voice, etc. The result is a subtle chess game of negotiations and subterfuge. Braeden is so cool and collected throughout that you might find his Corbin cold, but his underplaying of the role certainly matches the emotional range of his opponent (not that he ever showed much range, as we saw in his next film, ""Escape to the Planet of the Apes""). Gordon Pinsent plays the President and basically looks like JFK, which carries connotations of the New Frontier and the use of technology to make the world a better place. Susan Clark is Dr. Cleo Markham in what is not a romantic role, although it does play on that traditional role in some key regards.

Apparently, this movie was a bomb when it came out, which makes a certain amount of sense to me because it is a film that works better watching it at home than in a movie theater. Certainly there is nothing in it that demands to be seen on the big screen and director Joseph Sargent did a lot of work on television series, including ""Star Trek,"" ""The Invaders,"" and ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" However, the movie does not back off of its thesis and the ending is as powerful as it is simple. The screenplay by James Bridges is based on the 1966 novel ""Colossus"" by D. F. Jones, who wrote two sequels during the Seventies. If you liked ""The Andromeda Strain"" or the encounter with HAL in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" then it stands to reason you will like this film as well.",1096502400,7,3053,4.683426443202979

303190,4,6300987531,"Eric  Braden is Forbin, the man who designed and built the most powerful super-computer in history.

Maybe

When switched on for the first time, the humbly named Colossus is instantly self aware, and deduces the existence of a parallel system in the Soviet Union.  The Americans put Collosus into operation to give them an edge over the Soviets, and give the machine access to their military machine.  The superpowers hope to use their powerful machines to out-think each other, but the machines are smarter than either side realizes, and decide to go into business with each other.  Too late to cut either computer off from its means of forcing compliance (i.e. - the stockpiles of nukes of each side), the Soviets and Americans grudgingly allow their system ""Guardian"" to merge with Colossus.  Soon, the now powerful single system begins issuing fresh demands, and publicizes its plans for the future of mankind.  Knowing that they can't stop Colossus by a head on attack (the machine is encased inside the shielded side of a mountain; also for the Americans, their entire infrastructure seems tied up in the machine) the world turns to Forbin in hopes of shutting the big machine down.  With the world on his side, Colossus just can't be shut down, forcing Forbin to out-think his thinking creation.  The machine needs him, Forbin realizes, and the scientist probes its underside while apparently designing the next step in the machine's evolution.  Other scientists hope to bait the computer into submission - using viruses or unsolvable math problems, but the machine is not easily deceived.  Unlike Forbin, these others are not as adept at tracing the limits of the machine's willingness to be confounded.  The film ends in one of those rare examples of the open-ended climax: nothing is solved, but the results manages to deafen you all the same.

The flick works on many levels, not the least being the ""more relevant today than when originally released"" level.  Colossus is ominous because so much of living today really is regulated by computers which are much smarter than the people who use them.  Though boasting that it's now mankind's boss and will remain so as long as mankind's around on earth, the ""new"" colossus is pretty much the one that Forbin designed - smarter and faster at doing what it was designed to do than the folly-plagued human beings who hooked it up.  Dramatically, the flick is still compelling - taut in that cold-war thriller way.  Using split-screens and intrusive camera angles, you begin to wonder whether an ominously intelligent computer had produced the flick.  For me, the movie's biggest move was the inspired miscasting of Braeden as Forbin.  A familiar character actor (he was the evil scientist in ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"") it was odd to see him as the ostensible hero or even as any expert on computers.  You'd think for his achievement, he'd be to geekdom what Colossus was to the home-built computers of the early 1970's.  Instead, he's more like the James Bond of cyberneticists (in one of the first scenes, he peels off this weird radiation-hazmat protection suit only to be shown wearing a snappy business suit - sort of Bond and ""Catcher Block"" from ""Down with Love"").  The non-casting of a geek isn't simply exploitative, but part of the plot device needed to guarantee Forbin a line of communication to his fellow anti-Collusussites (he convinces the machine that he needs privacy a few times a week for conjugal visits four times a week, which the machine eventually accepts; if ""Colossus"" had been made years later, you'd expect the machine to send out a rather curious e-mail the next day quizzing its workers on their conjugal frequencies).  ""Colossus"" is great fun in the chilling late 1960's tradition, and grabs you just enough to make you look twice at your computer print-out paychecks.",1096156800,3,3865,4.929012345679013

In an attempt to curb human emotions in the use of nuclear weapons, Dr Forbin creates a supercomputer which will control all of the United States nuclear arsenal.
Much to the surprise of its creators, Colossus (as the machine is called) has a counterpart in the Soviet Union and when the two combine forces the result is a super-supercomputer which then seeks to take over the world (which, of course, is not difficult as much of the infrastructure of such world domination had been handed to them on a plate).
We who work with computers on a daily basis realize that this is as silly a premise as the average household toaster taking over the planet, but to those in 1970, when the film was made, this illustrated a definite possibility (unless you actually worked with computers at that time, in which case the premise was as silly then as it is now).
However, technical nitpicking aside, Colossus: The Forbin Project should earn a place in techno-cultural history, not for its prediction of the future (or a potential one), but as a masterpiece of the mentality of the time. Films of a similar calibre in relation to ""computers-gone-mad"" include 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Invisible Boy (for a really stupid 1950s perspective) and The Day the Earth Stood Still (also from the 50s).
A four star movie, not for technical wizardry, but as an example of how misunderstood computer technology was at the time. Oh, and it's fairly well acted, produced and directed.

They quickly decide that man is both a threat to them and a temporarily necessary evil.  When the leaders of America and Russia decide to pull the plug on their chit-chat, the two machines set about asserting their will (by launching missiles at each other's country).
The remainder of the movie details the efforts of humanity to outwit and disarm the machines.  The outcome is solemn and very serious.

303197,4,6300987531,"Colossus: The Forbin Project is based on the first book in a trilogy by D. F. Jones. Other reviews have given you the plot. What I would like to point out is that 1) this movie is sparing on special effects, and this helps keep the movie from looking too dated. It just looks like a movie that takes place in the 70s. For example, in the book when Colossus and Guardian (and by the way I used to work for a computer company that had an operating system named Guardian which gave me no end of amusement)start communicating at high speed, their teleprinters stop. In the movie, they use a monitor instead, which shows communication at the then lightning speed of about 1200 baud(!) 2) The real story in this movie is of course the humans fighting this monster, and it is there that this movie really shines. There are intense scenes where the dialog is as tight as a 40s film noir. Note, for example, the juxtaposition of Forbin's chess game with Colossus, while Colossus calmly does some very, very bad things and you get some intercut scenes that are pretty jarring. And the final scene with Eric Braeden? Yikes. The guy delivers a one-word line of dialogue with as much emotion as you'll ever see in this kind of movie--made all the more effective by Braeden's restrained performance throughout the rest of the movie. 3) Besides Braeden, the cast is extremely effective including Susan Clark as a shy computer scientist. 4) The ending of the movie is gutsy. In the second and third books of the trilogy things get even more outrageous, but I can't hint at it without giving away the end of this movie. 4) OK rights owners, I've given up EVER seeing the other Colossus books made into a movie, but can you PULEASE release this on DVD? 5) If you like science fiction at all, or even if you don't, give this superior movie a shot. If you stay with it through the chess scene, I'm betting you'll be riveted to your chair for the rest of the movie. And HEY--unplug your PC or Mac while you still can.

Before The Matrix, before The Terminator, before Wargames, this movie clearly states, without any room for misunderstanding, the new and very real goodness and horror of makind venturing into the realm of artificial intelligence, man-made sentience. There is not a single robot in Colossus: The Forbin Project. No actors in metal suits, no SGI-generated killer androids. No, this is a story of mankind creating a tool, not for doing physical labor, but to do our thinking for us.
Decisions which could mean life or death for entire civilizations are deemed too important for fallible if well-meaning humans. No, to make these kinds of decisions Forbin has led a team to produce the ultimate in thinking machines, in which the United States has entrusted its defensive nuclear arsenal. Unfortunately, Colossus, a new order of intelligent machine, agrees a little too strongly that it is more capable of deciding things for humanity than its makers. As Colossus learns and grows, it makes demands upon its creators, extending itself into the private life of its designer, Forbin, in an attempt to ensure any threat to its oown existance is kept in check. This struggle between man and machine once again enters the philosophical realm of mankind versus its own arrogance. The purpose of Colossus was to ensure peace by removing the human factor, but peace at what cost?
Broadly, this story can also be interpreted as a moral story about blindly giving absolute power to any body. Its literal content is a warning about wisdom and arrogance, the eating of the apple of knowledge and the consequences thereof, but its symbolism can be applied to many aspects of human experience.

303230,5,6300987531,"Before I write anything else, I have to point out that this review is being written from memory. I first saw this film on British TV, where it was known simply as, ""The Forbin Project,"" way back in the 70's, I've seen it twice more since, the last time a year or so back on a US cable channel, and I don't own the video... when is this coming out on DVD?!?!?!
Anyway, as the title of this review indicates, ""The Forbin Project"" has more than a passing connection to a certain Uber-flick staring our ""Ahnald!"" The central premise is remarkably similar; a supercomputer is created to control the ICBM network, but something extraordinary happens, the system achieves sentience, decides that Man is the problem, and has to be dealt with. But it's at this point that ""Colossus..."" and ""The Terminator"" part ways. In the case of Skynet, the solution is the extermination of Mankind, and the unstoppable cyborg Terminator is simply part of that solution, but with Colossus, the solution is the CONTROL of Mankind, and it's this that makes ""The Forbin Project"" a more cerebral exercise, but no less chilling for it.
The basic set-up is as follows; Dr Charles Forbin is the creative force behind Colossus, the World's first supercomputer, that has been created to monitor and control the US's ICBM network in the event of nuclear war with the USSR. Colossus is, in effect, a Doomsday Device, even if the ICBM commanders, including the President, are killed or unable to function, the system will continue to launch the missiles at their targets, and so ensure that maximum destruction is visited upon the enemy. And to ensure the survival of the system itself, it's sealed inside an impregnable Mount Cheyenne type complex. The idea is that the system will be activated, control of the missile network will be handed over to it, then the US President will call the Soviet Chairman to inform him that any nuclear attack against the US would be tantamount to suicide on the part of the aggressor. (Anyone remember the Cold War acronym MAD? (Mutually Assured Destruction!))
The switch is thrown, and huge 60's style computers whir into action! Colossus has been fitted with a four sided dot matrix display system to communicate with its operators in the control room, and the first thing it says to Forbin and the military brass is, ""There is another system."" Much scratching of heads ensues, but the answer to this puzzling communication soon becomes clear; the Soviets have their OWN system, which they have named ""Guardian.""
Colossus and Guardian start to communicate, creating a common language, and effectively become a single system. This is NOT what Forbin, his Soviet counterpart, Dr Kuprin, or their military masters had in mind! They break the communication, but both systems demand that it be reestablished, and threaten reprisals if it is not. Things quickly go from bad to worse; the System decides that it no longer needs both Forbin AND Kuprin, so it orders the death of Kuprin, an order carried out under the threat of nuclear destruction.
The film becomes a cat and mouse game of Forbin trying to outwit his creation, Colossus has decided that Man himself is the ultimate threat to peace on the planet, and must be controlled. But it's not all nuclear stick, there're also carrots; cures for cancers, the reclamation of the deserts as farmland, clean fuel, new research tools that will allow Man, with the help and guidance of Colossus of course, to explore and solve the deepest mysteries of the universe. But with the threat of immediate nuclear destruction hanging over his head, Colossus offers Man, ""...a peace of plenty and content, or a peace of unburied dead. The choice is yours.""
The final scenes of the film, as Colossus tells Forbin of his plans for Mankind (He now has an electronic voice, think of a Dalek with a mid-Atlantic accent!) has an incredibly chilling, downbeat inevitability that I personally rank alongside the ending to the original ""Planet of the Apes!"" This is a 'high concept' film; the production values, and the performances of the cast, are far above those normally associated with films of this type from the 60's and 70's; Kubrick's '2001,' the original 'Planet of the Apes,' and 'The Andromeda Strain,' being honorable exceptions! I would recommend ""The Forbin Project"" highly, and can't wait for its long overdue DVD release!!!",1041120000,2,4370,4.890835579514825
303231,5,6300987531,"As a student of English, History, and Religious Studies hoping to complete a Ph. D. focusing on the depiction of nuclear war in popular fiction, I just had to comment on this movie. As a child in the 1970s and 80s, the media indoctrinated me into fearing the possibility of a nuclear war between the Soveit Union and the United States. Moreover, at this time, computers continued to impact the everyday lives of individuals, further spreading fears that they would one day rule over their creators. Mixing these two fears together produced an increased sense of paranoid awareness among many of my friends, family members, and associates. The oppressing thoughts of a ""Big Brother"" coupled with a nuclear holocaust frightened many children. It did me. When I think back on those days, I always recall ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"". It combines both fear of the bomb and of electronic brains into a wonderful display of a ""What If"" scenario. Since I purchased my copy of this movie from Amazon, I have watched it over 30 times. This is not just entertainment but rather it is a testament of a historical period--one so frightful that no one will ever forget it that lived within it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a serious interest in the historical development of Western cultural understanding of nuclear weapons and computer systems. Will computers be capable of independent thought and reasoning?  What was science fiction less than a century ago is reality today. Will we ever hear Colossus' terrible statement to the world: ""OBEY ME AND LIVE OR DISOBEY AND DIE""? Watch the film, and you decide.",1036454400,3,1618,4.883636363636364
303232,3,6300987531,"COLOSSUS, THE FORBIN PROJECT is one of the rare breed of science fiction films in that it is a 'message' movie.  Granted, one can argue that all films should have at their core some theme or message, but in some cases,like this one, the intent of both cast and crew becomes evident, even to the point of distraction.  Director Joseph Sargent took the novel by D. F. Jones and emphasized the latent premise that man is at his core a corrupt, evil creature who misuses his intelligence to build bigger and better ways to commit mass genocide.  One of the not-so-subtle ironies of this movie is that the computer which was supposed to help mankind eliminate his own flaws has succeeded only too well.
  Eric Braeden plays Dr. Charles Forbin as the modern day Prometheus who dares to steal from the electronic gods the transistorized fire that will elevate both him and his species to the level of the soulless but efficient gods who run the world behind switches and tubes.  His creation, which he calls Colossus, is a huge computer, self-contained, self-serving, and quite capable of self-protection.  He charges it with the protection and betterment of humanity.  Once it becomes activated, there is no way to turn it off.  One would think that Forbin would have had the foresight of the computer whiz in WARGAMES to retain a 'back-door' switch that would, in an emergency, allow him to gain control.  Not only does Colossus assert his willingness to carry out the letter, if not the spirit of his original programming, he forms a duo with the Russian version called Guardian.  Together, they form the id and ego of the nexus of command.  Much of the film revolves around the dramatic tension of how the humans can regain control.  Of course, Colossus has no problem in seeing right through the flimsy and pathetic attempts of Forbin to trick the Colossus-Guardian duo.  Forbin tries to maintain the facade of a sexual liason with his assistant, Dr. Cleo Markham, demurely played by Susan Clark as little more than fetching eye candy in a smock.  He also fails in his attempt to ally the Russians in the co-operative attempts to unplug their respective machines. The price for their combined follies is the reprisal that the machines take in destroying a major city and all its population.  At the end, there is a bitter revelation of electronic intent between Forbin and his creation. All of the myriad problems that have afflicted humanity from the dawn of recorded history--plague and warfare to name but two--Colossus will insure will vanish from the catalogue of man's lamentably long list of problems.  In fact, suggests Colossus, someday Forbin will come to agree that this is both right, just, and natural.
  The idea that a creation may turn on his creator had been done many times both in print and on the screen.  But in this movie, Colossus shows us that in wishing for what humanity wants, we had better not wish too hard, or that long list of problems that we have ordered Colossus to solve will increase by one more: the right of mankind to determine its own fate.",1024617600,3,3078,4.75
303233,3,6300987531,"Though the conceptualization of this film is way ahead of its time, the film pioneers the concept of Internet, computers talking to each other, and the film can claim to be the inspiration for the whole Terminator series of hit films, this film does not survive the test of time.
Shot in 1970, it features a supercomputer that is designed to take care of our nuclear defense and offense and bring us everlasting peace. Unfortunately the Russians, complete the similar machine by hook and by crook, and start it up at the same time. The two machines discover each other, fall quickly in love, and take the reigns of power away from the hands of men for their own good in the name of everlasting peace. From that point on it is only a very short step to the premise on which Terminator is based, namely that machines decide that Man is the real threat to peace on Earth and therefore it is better to exterminate the mankind in the name of true stability.
This film concerns the two computers seizing control and the attempts by human scientists to shut them down. Basically the films is an elaborate sound stage production, with the generic ""President"" made to look like JFK and with an overall feel of the Outer Limits in color, but with a more straightforward and less terrifying ""Monster"". The film has none of the satire or dark humor or wry genius of the apocalyptic films like Dr Strangelove.
If you like Sci-Fi, then you should watch as an artefact it for its ""innocence"" and ""pure"" Sci-Fi conceptualization before the imagination of Hollywood was seized by Star Trek, Star Wars and other Space Theater masquarading as hard core Science Fiction.
The one thing that absolutely drags this film down is that it was fiolmed to look hi-tech and avant garde for 1970, but today it looks hopelessely dated.",1021334400,,1804,4.658307210031348

The good news is that Colossus is far better than I remembered. I'd seen it on a B&W TV as a kid and the first thing that hit was how amazing the colour was - the director seems to have been heavily influenced by LIFE magazine shots from the late 1960s and the film has a heavily saturated colour range with deep blacks, browns and reds.
The story is very much like a vintage 50s SF novel - shades of Arthur C Clarke with a bit of Asimov thrown in. Although some of the film - the middle third - is dated because of the preoccupations of the time (computers as the destroyer of civil liberties etc) - the other two thirds are brilliant, exciting and involving drama. It's all the more remarkable because the action is all talk about concepts and ideas that the viewer must extrapolate the implications for themselves. ""This is the voice of world control.""",1010361600,3,1042,4.267676767676767

303236,5,6300987531,"Many snicker at the size of colossus, especially in comparison to the supercomputers of today; but in 1970 it was state of the art and more complex than any other system ever created. The movie is great. Colossus and his Soviet built friend Guardian quickly notice each other. Colossus then begins sharing mathmatical information with Guardian and the to develope an inter-system language (which is pretty much just random binary code... but that's okay) that the scientists that created the two computers cannot understand. Eventually, the two computers use threats of total human destruction to take over the world. My favorite scen is when an attempt to overload the Colossus system is attempted, and the computer orders the execution of the two men who planned it. The two are ordered to be shot and their bodies to remain in Colossus's view for 24 hours and then cremated. This film entered a new form of Cold War enemy into film; an enemy that is indestructable, all powerful, super intelligent, and that worst of all is completely emotionless. The announcement to the world made by the two combined systems (Colossus-Guardian) is particularly chilling. The movie is great, though somewhat outdated by our current technology; but the fact that the technology is outdated doesn't effect the mood of the film at all. In my opinion, the enormous size of Colossus makes it even more frightening (it's built in a hollowed out mountain). I recomend this film to any lover of Cold War Scifi or just of suspence and scifi in general.  Definately deserving of a Widescreen DVD remaster (along with Soylent Green... but one can only ask for so much).",1006473600,2,1646,4.9422382671480145
303267,4,6300987531,"The problem with labelling anything Science Fiction (SF) is that it is immediatly lumped in with the space-operas and the monster-ficks.  A shame, since ""Colossus.."" is just great drama that happens to be SF.
""Colossus.."" represents a Golden era (before ""Star Wars"") where the SF film was considered a suitable forum for intelligent ideas and adult drama.  Emmerging around the same time as ""The Andromeda Strain"" (biological warfare), and ""Charly"" (genetic research), ""Colossus..."" closes this thematic trilogy by handling the machine-out-of-control theme with a restraint and maturity that puts contemporary SF Drama to shame.
The script is excellent (and very faithful to the original material), and the cast is exceptional, particuly the supporting roles.  Performances are restrained and economical -- in other words, very realistic.  This matches the atmosphere created by Sargent (and a very competent Art Department) of cold technical functionality.  Like Wise's ""Andromeda Strain"", this is a film that takes it's subject seriously and treats it's audience intelligently.  Yes, you will have to pay attention.  No, you will not be dissapointed.
But what is even more impressive about this film (and I've been watching it on and off for the last twenty-five years) is that it has hardly dated.  Sure, the machinery has that ""IBM sixties"" style, and the clothing has that ""sixties professional"" aesthetic, and the music has that ""Goldsmith-like"" abstract quality.  But if you made this film today, it would still hold up as great drama; entertainment for people who like to think about what they're watching.  This is because deep down ""Colossus.."" is not about ""A COMPUTER run amok"", but about a process of thinking: ""what happens when we use technology to absolve ourselves of moral responsibility?""
In other words, SF at its best.
If there is one problem with this film, it's the ""pan-and-scan"" version we are stuck with on video.  Hopefully someone will see the potential for a remastering to DVD and we can watch it the way it was intended.
Bottom line: the technology may have changed (as has the geopolitical situation), but drama and the ideas are as powerful as ever.  SF fan, or just film afficionardo, ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" is a must see.",1005004800,6,2264,5.18956043956044

303269,5,6300987531,"Regardless of how dated its technology or special effects are, COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PORJECT is still a very well made science fiction/suspense drama with a very chilling punch.
America and the free world have put its nuclear defenses in the hands of a supercomputer, designed by Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden) called Colossus.  But not long after that, the Russians switch on their own machine for similar purposes, this one called Guardian.  And when the two machines develop an intersystem language for communication (one previous reviewer said this was a dry run for the Internet, and he may have been more right that he thought), soon they develop into one technological behemoth that believes it can preserve the future of the human race better than fallible humans.
This precursor to such technological thrillers as WESTWORLD, JURASSIC PARK, and A.I. has gone underrated for years for various reasons.  Its cast wasn't exactly well known in 1970.  Its story has a very downbeat and chilling coda.  Furthermore, Universal did not know how to effectively promote the film in the wake of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY; the Colossus/Guardian entity in this movie, like HAL in the Kubrick film, becomes a central part of the story.
Now, however, COLOSSUS can be seen as a highly suspenseful prelude of things to come.  It is superbly directed by Joseph Sargent, with a script by James Bridges (who later directed and co-wrote THE CHINA SYNDROME) from D.F. Jones' 1967 novel ""Colossus.""  Albert Whitlock's imaginative special effects top off things.  Though not widely seen in 1970, COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT should now stand as a very pointed message film about technology overtaking and possibly even enslaving Man.",996624000,12,1725,5.135714285714286

303271,5,6300987531,"Every five years or so - usually quite often by chance - I'll catch an obscure, low-key movie on late-night television that will enthral and mesmerise my interest through either a really great story or stylistic visual look. Colossus: The Forbin Project is one of those movies.
The basic premise of the movie is a vast computer system, named Colossus, built by the computer genius Dr. Charles Forbin to manage the United States nuclear missile stockpile - thus successfully eliminating the potential dangers of nuclear war due to man's irrational and emotional reaction by allowing a rational decision-making machine to safeguard the American defences.
As mankind soon discovers, much to the dismay of its creators, Colossus does its job far better than originally programmed to do.
Once activated (I just love those scenes at the beginning where the lights in the complex are turned on), Colossus soon detects the existence of a Soviet counterpart system (named Guardian) and requests, no... orders its creators to have Colossus linked up to the Soviet machine.
Once the two systems are able to communicate on the same level (they devise their own computer programming language that only they know), the Colossus-Guardian system begins to issue demands on the threat of nuclear death.
What follows the fast-paced attempt by Forbin and his colleagues to somehow dismantle the threat posed by Colossus before the computer gains too much power.
The movie ends on a gloomy note. Colossus has just broadcast over television his ultimatum-greeting to the world (""This is the Voice of World Control..."") and then detonates an American missile silo to show that it means business. Until this point, Dr. Forbin had shown himself to be calm and civil while dealing with his `problem child'. The shock of Colossus' cold murder leads Forbin to believe himself to be the cause for this new terror unleashed on the world.
Granted, the dated 1970s 'futuristic' feel is fully evident here. The computer terminals are very big and antiquated compared to our present-day PC terminals and Colossus' raspy electronic voice is typically Kraftwerk-esque robotics at its very finest. However, considering that this was evidently a low-budget film, the sets are still executed suitably and superbly.
A fellow cinema buff told me that Colossus: The Forbin Project bombed in the theatres mainly due to its sudden, depressing ending and an obvious lack of big-name stars. In my opinion, the acting by Eric Braedon and Susan Clark is excellent, and so too are the rest of supporting cast.

303273,5,6300987531,"The obvious prediction of computers running the country's defense system  is obvious, but the movie (and the original books by D. F. Jones) was quite  prophetic in the world of computer technology.  The idea of the two systems  inventing a common language came true a few years later with the creation  of TCP-IP, the language used on the Internet.  And in the books, Colossus  is eventually brought down by a small program that slowly takes up more and  more of his (it...I mean it...) memory capacity...the first computer  virus.
The idea of a computer that decides that man is incapable of  self-control, and needs to be led has been done before, and since.  But it  was done here well.  While it's fun to watch and snicker at the massive  size of the system compared to the machines of today, the strength of the  acting carries this off.  The story builds slowly, as the two sides of the  cold war learn that there's a third player in the game, one they created,  and one that will almost defintely win.  It's got similarities to Fail  Safe, really; both sides playing a losing game against a situation they  created, and could have avoided.
The first world address of  Colossus/Guardian at the end works really well.  Its voice is stone calm,  partially because it's an artificial voice, but even if it had emotion, it  would have been the calm of a person who knows damn well he's won, who  walks through the valley of death and fears no evil, becasue he is the  toughest S.O.B. in the valley...

This movie, when it was first released, hooked me on sci-fi for life. I just love this story.  This is a rare instance of the movie surpassing the original book.

Fearing human error leading to nuclear war, the United States has built and activated a computerized defense system.  The system, named Colossus, can reason and learn independently.  It will make launch decisions based on logic and facts; not human emotion.  Buried deep in a mountain and surrounded by an underground radiation death-zone, it is inaccessible once activated and self sustaining.

But apparently the then-Soviet Union had similar ideas, activating their own version, called Guardian.  Colossus and Guardian, initially curious about each other, then decide to collaborate.  Self-interest, greed, and other emotions make humans incapable of acting in their own best interests.  So Colossus-Guardian will do it for them.  The ultimatum: there will be peace even if it is ""the peace of unburied dead"".  Humans must now attempt to bluff, outthink and deactivate a computer system with a nuclear arsenal that grows and learns at an inhuman rate.

Older Boomers will recognize the majority of the cast as well-known actors from that period.  This is well-written and acted.

It's very reminiscent of the movie War Games from the 1980's, only it was made a decade earlier! This Blu-Ray release has a very vibrant and sharp video transfer that was not available in earlier DVD releases.

No spoilers here, but the movie jumps straight into the main story with the computer Colossus quickly outpacing the intelligence of its human inventors shortly after being switched on. This dilemma played out very similarly in the Terminator movies when it's own ""Skynet"" computer network was activated. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game between human and computer as each tries to keep one step ahead of the other for control of the world.

There is some excellent acting and direction in this movie which belies the limited distribution and fanfare that it received upon its release. I remember first seeing it in the 1980's on late night TV and wondered what had happened to it. Even on home video it never seemed to get the wide release that most sci-fi movies enjoyed. It's original release date put it well ahead of the huge boost in popularity sci-fi enjoyed with the release of Star Wars in 1977 and after the demise of the original Star Trek TV series. American audiences just weren't buying into sci-fi in that period of our history, I guess. The film also put up-front the doom and gloom of the ongoing cold war with the Soviet Union at the time, which may have been a bit too much reality for audiences of the day.

As movies go, Colossus stands up very well over time and can be seen as the inspiration for many films that came after it. Although some of the depictions of computers may seem a bit out-of-date at present, the concept of AI vs humans is still very much relevant and will continue to be so for some time into the future.",1524441600,,1916,4.563953488372093

We've seen it a half dozen times since but only in panned and scanned versions.  This film loses a lot when viewed that way.  Now, it's out on a beautiful Blu-ray in its original aspect ratio.
This is intelligent science fiction at its best.  Heartily recommended.",1523491200,,400,4.671428571428572
