8377357,5,6303332714,"This is one of Kathy's older videos but it is one of my favourites. There is a warm up, followed by toning for the arms (rubber bands optional), 4 aerobic sections, abdominal toning, toning for the legs and buttocks (rubber bands optional), and a cool down. The choreography is fun yet challanging, and the music keeps you motivated. A good workout which I highly recommend for intermediate and advanced exercisers!",1064361600,,415,4.942857142857143
