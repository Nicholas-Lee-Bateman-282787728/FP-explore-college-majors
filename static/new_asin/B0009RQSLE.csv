8065627,4,B0009RQSLE,"The story and content matter chronicles and encompasses a lot more than just the life of one man, JACOB - THE MAN WHO FOUGHT WITH GOD (Genesis 25:24-50:14). Rather, this 1963 Christian Classic which comes to it's audience in full color, on a single-disc DVD and is a feature length film that starts out depicting the beginning of the Book of Genesis within the Old Testament of the Holy Bible, with the Lords' Creation - Adam & Eve and their sons: Cain and Abel (Genesis 2:7; 2:18-25 & 4:1-2). And further, in accordance to the Holy Written - Word of God (John 1:1; 1:14 & II Timothy 3:16), this biblical drama continues to flow sequentially in it's portrayal of: Noah and his Ark (Genesis 6:8 - 9:28), followed by the pride of Nimrod and the doomed construction of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 10:8-10 & 11:1-9). And the calling of the 'Father of Faith' - the Patriarch Abraham (Genesis 11:27-25:11; Romans 4:1-25 & Galatians 3:5-9), and the brutal test of that faith, in the sacrificing of his only Covenant Son - Isaac (Genesis 17:18-21 & 22:1-18). Then comes, the compelling and moving depiction of the life of JACOB - THE MAN WHO FOUGHT WITH GOD and his Divine 'Name Change', too that of: Israel (Genesis 32:22-32). Wherein finally..., having learned his lesson(s), he returned too and re-entered the long awaited, Promised Land of Canaan. The land of milk-n-honey. The land of his fathers who just happened to have been the first two Patriarch's - Abraham and Isaac, respectively. And also, the land that the Lord has forever, blessed and sanctified for His Chosen People. The Holy Land of Israel. Thus, making him the third Patriarch of the Jewish People. Who would have thought..., considering the fact that the name, JACOB means: Deceiver and supplanter?! (Genesis 27:35-36 NKJV). And as you will see, JACOB - THE MAN WHO FOUGHT WITH GOD, definitely lived up to that, name. This is an entertaining biblical drama that in motion picture form, makes the Holy Bible come alive as it centers on the life of JACOB and concisely depicts his wilderness experience. His blessings, his betrayal of his older brother Esau, his passionate desire for his beloved Rachel, his intrigue, jealousy and misrepresentation expertise. Along with his loneliness, deception, marital 'wheeling and dealing' by his equally conniving Uncle - Laban, together with greed, selfishness, fear for one's life and his long term objective of re-entering his homeland, Canaan. But, not before he faces himself within the 'Mirror-of-Truth' and has a life changing encounter with the Lord. After which, forgiveness in many forms and trust in God, and moving on with ones journey in life..., stabilize the erratic JACOB and mature him into a blessed, servant of the Lord. Yes, JACOB - THE MAN WHO FOUGHT WITH GOD, the one-time 'deceiver and supplanter' who knew how to dish-it-out, is also the man who got more than a spoonful of his own medicine, back. Payback's for his past transgressions? Oh, yeah. Plenty! This historically and spiritually accurate drama, is more than just entertaining. It's educational and thought provoking, as well. So, whether you're a Christian or not, you will probably enjoy the show. Why? Because if anything, it really is a good movie. And, a memorable keeper for your home or church DVD collection.
