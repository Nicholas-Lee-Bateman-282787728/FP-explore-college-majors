8441227,4,B004U6YMOU,"If you're a real Stringhead, you'll want this even though it consists only of three live performances and a brief interview (taken from the film ""Be Glad""). Recorded in 1970, it includes a medley of Irish jigs (with Mike on bass, Rose on mandolin, and Licorice playing spoons and then dancing a Highland fling), and two radically reworked songs from the first ISB album, ""Empty Pocket Blues"" (cheerfully sung by Likky and Rose) and ""Everything Is Fine Right Now"" (Mike on bass, Rose on organ, Robin on mandolin, and Likky on guitar). The girls are blooming, the guys full of smiles, and the whole thing quite charming, even though it was filmed in an empty studio.",1324080000,17,664,4.732758620689655
