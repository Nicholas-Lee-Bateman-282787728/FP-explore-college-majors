3154820,5,B0016AJ1RG,"Review of Soul Masters
Soul Masters is an incredibly beautiful and inspiring movie. This true story brings to light the kinds of miracles that these two Soul Masters perform in the service of humanity. The filmmaker, Sandy Zeig, begins by telling the story of her father's healing. Then she tells of her trip to China with Zhi Gang Sha and other students, to visit his teacher Master Chi Chen Guo.

Much of the film takes place in China, in a small city, a few hours by car south of Beijing. The viewer is treated to scenes of Master Guo healing clinic. The light, energy, and love of his healers and students revealed in each frame of the movie captivate the audience.

When Master Sha introduces and speaks to his teacher, his love, devotion and gratitude are apparent in his eyes and very gestures. This love of disciple and teacher is so very touching. It is an example we in the West need, for so often, we do not appreciate our teachers and mentors enough.

As a woman, I particularly loved the role Mrs. Guo plays in the film. Master Guo has five daughters. In traditional China, and still today, male children are preferred. Mrs. Guo tells of the birth of the daughters, and how she and Master Guo loved each successive daughter even more. Today, the whole family works together, serving patients at the clinic. It is a wonderful family story.

Master Sha and Master Guo come from a lineage of Taoist Masters, who hold metaphysical secrets of health and longevity. These two soul masters represent the spiritual essence and the finest aspects of Chinese culture and civilization. This spiritual essence has a long history and tradition, extending back to the ancient ancestors who knew and lived the Tao.

The movie shows scenes of Master Guo instructing Master Sha. These scenes give us a glimpse of the closeness of master and disciple. They are filled with love, gratitude and affection. We also sense the many years of dedication to practice in order to accomplish a divine task.

The later part of the movies shows Master Sha in the West as he performs many healing sessions. There are several miraculous healings which are amazing and uplifting to witness. We walk away from the movie, healed, amazed, and uplifted. Our hearts and minds are open and we feel the love of the Divine.",1212192000,3,2295,4.71072319201995
3154821,5,B0016AJ1RG,"The movie ""Soul Masters"" is a moving tribute to the work and the lives of two incredible spiritual healers and teachers, Dr. and Master Zhi Gang Sha and his mentor Dr. and Master Zhi Chen Guo.

I suffered from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia for more than 17 years before I met Dr. Sha. I was unable to function normally and was totally disabled, I could not work. After becoming a student of Dr. Sha, I learned the principles of Soul Mind Body Medicine. I began a daily practice to heal my chronic illness. I achieved dramatic results very quickly.

Within 6 months of meeting Dr. Sha, my health improved dramatically. I was able to return to work as an accounting manager and I was amazed at how well I functioned. I was also amazed at how other parts of my life began to improve, heal and transform.

""Soul Masters"" movie is a visual introduction to the principles of healing using the power of soul.

""Heal the soul first; then healing of the mind and body will follow.""
 Dr. and Master Zhi Gang Sha

This is the foundation of the deep spiritual teaching and healing of these incredible spiritual masters. When the soul is healed, transformation of all aspects of life and spiritual enlightenment rapidly occurs.

I highly recommend viewing this movie to anyone who struggles with health issues or any life issues. This movie will touch and heal your heart, soul, mind and body and ignite the transformation process for your life.",1212105600,2,1444,4.683794466403162
3154822,5,B0016AJ1RG,"I have now had the opportunity to see this movie four times. Each time I see it I feel such deep love coming from these two healers and teachers. To see them reaching out to people with such compassion and dedication, believing that each person has the ability to heal when no one else did. That gives people hope. They listen not only with their ears but with there hearts. Healing not only the body but the soul. Now that is a belief I want to grab hold of. Connecting on the level of the soul with unconditional love, forgiveness and compassion is someone everyone on this planet could use a little of. Thank you Dr. Guo and Dr. Sha for your great committment, love and dedication to mankind.

3154823,5,B0016AJ1RG,"Soul Masters is a ground-breaking work which not only reveals profound spiritual wisdom for the first time in a mass media format, but also offers insight to the complex relationship between master and disciple.  This film chronicles the evolution of Master Guo's treatment of many of today's most common and destructive diseases - from cancer to the common cold -- using his mastery of multiple modalities such as traditional Chinese medicine and qi gong combined with years of spiritual practice and intensive clinical field study which was ultimately synthesized into Body Space Medicine.  I was struck by how even masters have seemingly infinite room to grow and evolve.  This is exemplified as the two masters opened the door to the realm of the soul, a development which led to Master Sha's dispatch to the West, his development of Soul Mind Body Medicine, and his mission to transform the consciousness of all mankind.  Soul Masters offers hope for a world where healing and enlightenment are possible at a time when it is sorely needed.",1212105600,2,1044,5.017341040462428
3154824,5,B0016AJ1RG,"The DVD Soul Masters explores healing concepts for this new age. The era of self healing and enlightenment. Dr. Sha takes us  on a journey to China to meet his teacher DR. Guo the man he has studied with for more than twenty years. It is amazing to watch these two great Masters working together healing the sick at Dr. Guo's center in Mainland China. These men are truly blessed and are  men of great compassion and wisdom.

There is no way you can walk away after viewing this DVD feeling it was just a waste of time or this is more of the same old stuff. You will know that with pratice and study you too can heal yourself and help in the healing of humanity. As Master Sha says ""Heal the soul first; then healing of the mind and body will follow."" We are truly blessed to have these two men in our presence to draw wisdom, knowledge, and understanding from.

Thank you,

3154826,5,B0016AJ1RG,"Soul Masters is a long overdue work. Those that have seen it should also obtain Dr. Sha's works, especially Soul, Mind Body medicine and Zhi Neng Medicine and Dr, Guo's Body Space Medicine.

I would recommend to others exploring Jerry Alan Johnson's Chinese Medical Qigong Therapy, Chunyi Lin's Spring Forest Qigong, 9 Palaces by Dr. Baolin Wu, Dao-In by Hua-Ching Ni, the Wild Goose Qigong series by Bingkun Hu (but especially Patting Along the Meridians), Liangong by Dr. Zhuang Yuan Ming, and Dr Yang, Jwing-Ming's Eight Pieces of Brocade.

3154831,2,B0016AJ1RG,"It is with mixed feelings that I write this- The world DOES need a soul movement - and Dr. Sha's teachings are based on some basic truths and provide empowering tools that can provide benefit...

But, I'm just not sure it needs the ultra-organized commercialized dogma of the Dr. Sha ""Mission"":

First of all, similar to his previous books, don't be duped by the ""best seller"" status or 5 star ratings:

1) members of the Mission contribute thousands of dollars in lieu of `blessings' from Master Sha as a part of a `book campaign' - these funds are used directly by Master Sha's institute to internally buy books from retailers 2 or 3 at a time to falsely and unethically stage the book's popularity (Google ""Dr Sha book campaign"" if you don't believe me)
2) members of the Mission are urged to write positive reviews about Master Sha's books, and get discounts for it...thus all the prosaic 5 star reviews.

It's not really that they want to sell lots of books - they want to attract more members to the Mission- i.e. to join the Sunday Blessings and the Retreats....which is where the real money is made. It's not that unlike this story: google ""Did dirty tricks create a best-seller""

Sure, the members deeply believe that they are promoting truth (indeed, other religions have done much worse in the name of God)...but personally, I don't find these methods to be all that `saintly'(it might even be karmic)... if there are real truths in the book and the Mission it would sell itself on its own merit like most best sellers do.

And what `services' does Master Sha offer at his blessings and retreats? Well, Master Sha believes that he is a ""Channel"" of the Divine, and he (and only he) has been given special powers. So he (and only he) can offer you- via the ""Dr Sha dot com"" channel (check it out for yourself):
- Divine Protection against every imaginable hazard
- clear your Karma for $2000. just like that - no followup or practice or nothing...even Dr, Sha calls it a ""short cut""
- Transplants for diseased organs
- Body Soul Transplant for $5000 (not explicitly listed in the web site, but it is a prerequisite, among others, to be come a Master Teacher Healer)
- Etc.
(actually, you can usually get the blessings for less because there is always a last minute special to appeal to the ""shoppers"")

What is a Body Soul Transplant? You current soul leaves you and a new soul (a saint) chooses you. Its sad that some people are so down they feel they need a brand new soul....and I guess all the poor folks have little chance at becoming a saint...how exclusive.

By the way, for the higher services, you aren't told the cost of these until you apply first, in which Dr. Sha receives Divine guidance in whether he should accept you. Imagine trying to say no after the Divine supposedly accepted you (but of course, these are ""priceless treasures"").

But that's just the tip of the iceberg...the later chapters of his books speak of the higher Soul Transformations etc. The ""highest"" downloads for the `chosen' ones are offered only at the ""invitation only"" retreats (i.e. for those who have `passed' the previous courses)...

Dr Sha's Sunday blessings are as follows:
He offers a free blessing (download). Then his top assistants (the ""professionals"" on ""dr sha dot com"" who have gone through the full Soul transformation and have received all the highest downloads so that their souls reside in their highest chakra and they can see with their third eye- paid for either with $ or Universal Service(tm) to the Mission) describe what they saw. Then all the people who have registered get their downloads. That's it.

Yes, the downloads might feel empowering, but inevitably you are left wanting more...if the top assistants can really see with their third eye, wouldn't you want that too? Well you can get there by getting the downloads, becoming indoctrinated through the courses and practice practice practice (the practice e.g. chanting, empowering statements etc can make you feel good) - till you believe it (or some would say become deluded?)

So inevitably, most are drawn to take the courses and to become a Universal Servant (requires you to volunteer time to the non-profit Institute that does all the `work' - whereas payments go to Dr Zhi Gang Sha LLC.). The courses all link together and coax you higher and higher, with the light at the end of the tunnel that eventually you might be able to charge for your services, like the ""Professionals"" on the web site - it's the classic pyramid marketing scheme.

But here is the hard part for me: people DO feel better... faith in the empowerments can help heal. But any one will feel better if they spend time getting out of their thinking brain and doing some chanting, setting good intentions, and having faith that they are empowered to make choices to make their lives better. And the collective energy at (any) group retreats is very powerful and healing. Why not rejoice in that - it might be the piece some people really need...

But when that collective energy at the retreat is highest, and people are feeling their best, that is when Dr. Sha `suggests' that his downloads can make you even better....which is made so easily done by sticking your personal barcode on a form (& voila, your credit card is charged). It's so effective that retreat registrants have to sign a legal disclaimer saying that all though the downloads are `priceless', they must spend `within their means"". From my experience, few of the faithful do, unless you call credit card bills and liquidation of savings as `within your means"". (many retreat attendees spend 10's of thousands)

Seems like Dr. Sha is selling water to people standing in a river. It's a shame that our consumerist society thinks we can `buy' everything. Its part of the reason we need a true soul movement.

Members of the Mission have made a huge leap of faith to jump on these tracks. But the light at the end of the tunnel might just be an oncoming train. After investing so much, it might take an even bigger leap of faith to get off...",1247011200,43,6065,4.696798493408663

Their message of universal love, peace, and harmony resonates in their students as they share their message with their followers and clients to heal themselves, to heal others and to spread soul enlightenment throughout the world.  Their spiritual message is powerful and especially needed as this time in the world.

Several years ago my life was a mess.  I thought I was going to die.  Had gout, bad knees, a stiff back, and was gaining weight.  Furthermore, I lost my law business and was bordering on losing all my real estate holdings.  In the middle of all this both my parents passed away within months of each other.  I started practicing tai chi and qigong.  This combined with the healing and universal ""love peace and harmony"" and spiritual teachings of Master Sha resulted in my physical, emotional, and mental healing and I'm now on the road to spiritual wellness.  I'm now in the best overall condition of my life.

I realize now that God had different plans for me and now am more able to flow with his directions for my life.  Clearing karma (with Master Sha's help) was important.  Recently, at a soul enlightenment retreat with Master Sha at Mount Shasta in California, I was able to manifest my wife and soul mate.  We both knew from the time we met that our meeting was through divine intervention.  My finances continually improve as I follow God's plan which is being revealed to me.  Now I enjoy and look forward to doing virtue (helping others with no expectations) and remote healings.

It's been a great ride and I look forward to continuing my soul journey with Soul Masters Sha and Guo with GOLD ... gratitude, obedience, loyalty, and devotion.  It very rare to find such great masters who are willing to share their knowledge and have such purity of soul.

The two Soul Masters, Dr. Sha and Dr. Guo, are very dedicated to serving humanity - to helping everyone - with love, care, and compassion. By making heart-to-heart and soul-to-soul connections they are able to help so many people - many with illnesses that seem incurable.

I am a student of  Dr. Sha's. I was very honored and blessed to have been able to visit Dr. Guo's clinic in China, which was where some of the Soul Masters movie was filmed. Being at the clinic was an experience that I will always remember and treasure. As the film showed, Dr. Guo does tongue readings to determine what herbs are appropriate to heal your condition. When I arrived at Dr. Guo's clinic my tongue was slanted, which was an indication of poor circulation. After taking the herbs that Dr. Guo prescribed, my tongue straightened out and my health improved. It was amazing!

Soul Masters reveals wisdom and techniques you can use to improve your health. Not only are Dr. Sha and Dr. Guo great healers, they empower people to heal themselves - to be involved in their own healing. Dr. Sha believes that healing occurs first on the soul level: Heal the soul first, then healing of the mind and body will follow. Your soul is very powerful. It can heal you and transform all aspects of your life.

  The Soul Masters movie carries a message of immense hope.  At this time when the medical industry has priced itself out of the reach of so many, and the government's Medicare program is collapsing under the strain of the double whammy of overpriced medical services and the aging of the boomers; its time to acknowledge that our current medical model is rapidly reaching its limits.
 Its time to open our minds to a new paradigm.  These Soul Masters invite us to refocus our healing efforts on to the soul level.  They give us key concepts fundamental to healing previously untreatable chronic, degenerative and even terminal diseases.  They show us that these diseases that have not been treatable at the physical level, are treatable at the soul level.  I know this to be true from personal experience.
 A few months ago I was diagnosed with high blood pressure.  My doctor wanted to put me on medication for the rest of my life.  I decided that first I would try soul healing.  I registered for just 1 of Dr. Sha's Sunday afternoon ""Divine Group Remote Healing, Rejuvenation and Transformation Sessions"".  My blood pressure normalized the very next day after receiving the healing.  It has been about 4 months and it is still completely normal, without drugs or significant dietary changes.

3389317,5,B0016AJ1RG,"Review of Soul Masters
Soul Masters is an incredibly beautiful and inspiring movie. This true story brings to light the kinds of miracles that these two Soul Masters perform in the service of humanity. The filmmaker, Sandy Zeig, begins by telling the story of her father's healing. Then she tells of her trip to China with Zhi Gang Sha and other students, to visit his teacher Master Chi Chen Guo.

Much of the film takes place in China, in a small city, a few hours by car south of Beijing. The viewer is treated to scenes of Master Guo healing clinic. The light, energy, and love of his healers and students revealed in each frame of the movie captivate the audience.

When Master Sha introduces and speaks to his teacher, his love, devotion and gratitude are apparent in his eyes and very gestures. This love of disciple and teacher is so very touching. It is an example we in the West need, for so often, we do not appreciate our teachers and mentors enough.

As a woman, I particularly loved the role Mrs. Guo plays in the film. Master Guo has five daughters. In traditional China, and still today, male children are preferred. Mrs. Guo tells of the birth of the daughters, and how she and Master Guo loved each successive daughter even more. Today, the whole family works together, serving patients at the clinic. It is a wonderful family story.

Master Sha and Master Guo come from a lineage of Taoist Masters, who hold metaphysical secrets of health and longevity. These two soul masters represent the spiritual essence and the finest aspects of Chinese culture and civilization. This spiritual essence has a long history and tradition, extending back to the ancient ancestors who knew and lived the Tao.

The movie shows scenes of Master Guo instructing Master Sha. These scenes give us a glimpse of the closeness of master and disciple. They are filled with love, gratitude and affection. We also sense the many years of dedication to practice in order to accomplish a divine task.

The later part of the movies shows Master Sha in the West as he performs many healing sessions. There are several miraculous healings which are amazing and uplifting to witness. We walk away from the movie, healed, amazed, and uplifted. Our hearts and minds are open and we feel the love of the Divine.",1212192000,3,2295,4.71072319201995
3389318,5,B0016AJ1RG,"The movie ""Soul Masters"" is a moving tribute to the work and the lives of two incredible spiritual healers and teachers, Dr. and Master Zhi Gang Sha and his mentor Dr. and Master Zhi Chen Guo.

I suffered from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia for more than 17 years before I met Dr. Sha. I was unable to function normally and was totally disabled, I could not work. After becoming a student of Dr. Sha, I learned the principles of Soul Mind Body Medicine. I began a daily practice to heal my chronic illness. I achieved dramatic results very quickly.

Within 6 months of meeting Dr. Sha, my health improved dramatically. I was able to return to work as an accounting manager and I was amazed at how well I functioned. I was also amazed at how other parts of my life began to improve, heal and transform.

""Soul Masters"" movie is a visual introduction to the principles of healing using the power of soul.

""Heal the soul first; then healing of the mind and body will follow.""

They listen not only with their ears but with there hearts. Healing not only the body but the soul. Now that is a belief I want to grab hold of.

3389320,5,B0016AJ1RG,"Soul Masters is a ground-breaking work which not only reveals profound spiritual wisdom for the first time in a mass media format, but also offers insight to the complex relationship between master and disciple.  This film chronicles the evolution of Master Guo's treatment of many of today's most common and destructive diseases - from cancer to the common cold -- using his mastery of multiple modalities such as traditional Chinese medicine and qi gong combined with years of spiritual practice and intensive clinical field study which was ultimately synthesized into Body Space Medicine.  I was struck by how even masters have seemingly infinite room to grow and evolve.  This is exemplified as the two masters opened the door to the realm of the soul, a development which led to Master Sha's dispatch to the West, his development of Soul Mind Body Medicine, and his mission to transform the consciousness of all mankind.

3389328,2,B0016AJ1RG,"It is with mixed feelings that I write this- The world DOES need a soul movement - and Dr. Sha's teachings are based on some basic truths and provide empowering tools that can provide benefit...

But, I'm just not sure it needs the ultra-organized commercialized dogma of the Dr. Sha ""Mission"":

First of all, similar to his previous books, don't be duped by the ""best seller"" status or 5 star ratings:

1) members of the Mission contribute thousands of dollars in lieu of `blessings' from Master Sha as a part of a `book campaign' - these funds are used directly by Master Sha's institute to internally buy books from retailers 2 or 3 at a time to falsely and unethically stage the book's popularity (Google ""Dr Sha book campaign"" if you don't believe me)
2) members of the Mission are urged to write positive reviews about Master Sha's books, and get discounts for it...thus all the prosaic 5 star reviews.

It's not really that they want to sell lots of books - they want to attract more members to the Mission- i.e. to join the Sunday Blessings and the Retreats....which is where the real money is made. It's not that unlike this story: google ""Did dirty tricks create a best-seller""

Sure, the members deeply believe that they are promoting truth (indeed, other religions have done much worse in the name of God)...but personally, I don't find these methods to be all that `saintly'(it might even be karmic)... if there are real truths in the book and the Mission it would sell itself on its own merit like most best sellers do.

And what `services' does Master Sha offer at his blessings and retreats? Well, Master Sha believes that he is a ""Channel"" of the Divine, and he (and only he) has been given special powers. So he (and only he) can offer you- via the ""Dr Sha dot com"" channel (check it out for yourself):
- Divine Protection against every imaginable hazard
- clear your Karma for $2000. just like that - no followup or practice or nothing...even Dr, Sha calls it a ""short cut""
- Transplants for diseased organs
- Body Soul Transplant for $5000 (not explicitly listed in the web site, but it is a prerequisite, among others, to be come a Master Teacher Healer)
- Etc.
(actually, you can usually get the blessings for less because there is always a last minute special to appeal to the ""shoppers"")

What is a Body Soul Transplant? You current soul leaves you and a new soul (a saint) chooses you. Its sad that some people are so down they feel they need a brand new soul....and I guess all the poor folks have little chance at becoming a saint...how exclusive.

By the way, for the higher services, you aren't told the cost of these until you apply first, in which Dr. Sha receives Divine guidance in whether he should accept you. Imagine trying to say no after the Divine supposedly accepted you (but of course, these are ""priceless treasures"").

But that's just the tip of the iceberg...the later chapters of his books speak of the higher Soul Transformations etc. The ""highest"" downloads for the `chosen' ones are offered only at the ""invitation only"" retreats (i.e. for those who have `passed' the previous courses)...

Dr Sha's Sunday blessings are as follows:
He offers a free blessing (download). Then his top assistants (the ""professionals"" on ""dr sha dot com"" who have gone through the full Soul transformation and have received all the highest downloads so that their souls reside in their highest chakra and they can see with their third eye- paid for either with $ or Universal Service(tm) to the Mission) describe what they saw. Then all the people who have registered get their downloads. That's it.

Yes, the downloads might feel empowering, but inevitably you are left wanting more...if the top assistants can really see with their third eye, wouldn't you want that too? Well you can get there by getting the downloads, becoming indoctrinated through the courses and practice practice practice (the practice e.g. chanting, empowering statements etc can make you feel good) - till you believe it (or some would say become deluded?)

So inevitably, most are drawn to take the courses and to become a Universal Servant (requires you to volunteer time to the non-profit Institute that does all the `work' - whereas payments go to Dr Zhi Gang Sha LLC.). The courses all link together and coax you higher and higher, with the light at the end of the tunnel that eventually you might be able to charge for your services, like the ""Professionals"" on the web site - it's the classic pyramid marketing scheme.

But here is the hard part for me: people DO feel better... faith in the empowerments can help heal. But any one will feel better if they spend time getting out of their thinking brain and doing some chanting, setting good intentions, and having faith that they are empowered to make choices to make their lives better. And the collective energy at (any) group retreats is very powerful and healing. Why not rejoice in that - it might be the piece some people really need...

But when that collective energy at the retreat is highest, and people are feeling their best, that is when Dr. Sha `suggests' that his downloads can make you even better....which is made so easily done by sticking your personal barcode on a form (& voila, your credit card is charged). It's so effective that retreat registrants have to sign a legal disclaimer saying that all though the downloads are `priceless', they must spend `within their means"". From my experience, few of the faithful do, unless you call credit card bills and liquidation of savings as `within your means"". (many retreat attendees spend 10's of thousands)

Seems like Dr. Sha is selling water to people standing in a river. It's a shame that our consumerist society thinks we can `buy' everything. Its part of the reason we need a true soul movement.

Members of the Mission have made a huge leap of faith to jump on these tracks. But the light at the end of the tunnel might just be an oncoming train. After investing so much, it might take an even bigger leap of faith to get off...",1247011200,43,6065,4.696798493408663

3389337,5,B0016AJ1RG,"Master Sha and his teacher Master Guo are two of the most powerful and successful qigong healers and teachers.  Their message of universal love, peace, and harmony resonates in their students as they share their message with their followers and clients to heal themselves, to heal others and to spread soul enlightenment throughout the world.  Their spiritual message is powerful and especially needed as this time in the world.

Several years ago my life was a mess.  I thought I was going to die.  Had gout, bad knees, a stiff back, and was gaining weight.  Furthermore, I lost my law business and was bordering on losing all my real estate holdings.  In the middle of all this both my parents passed away within months of each other.  I started practicing tai chi and qigong.  This combined with the healing and universal ""love peace and harmony"" and spiritual teachings of Master Sha resulted in my physical, emotional, and mental healing and I'm now on the road to spiritual wellness.  I'm now in the best overall condition of my life.

I realize now that God had different plans for me and now am more able to flow with his directions for my life.  Clearing karma (with Master Sha's help) was important.  Recently, at a soul enlightenment retreat with Master Sha at Mount Shasta in California, I was able to manifest my wife and soul mate.  We both knew from the time we met that our meeting was through divine intervention.  My finances continually improve as I follow God's plan which is being revealed to me.  Now I enjoy and look forward to doing virtue (helping others with no expectations) and remote healings.

It's been a great ride and I look forward to continuing my soul journey with Soul Masters Sha and Guo with GOLD ... gratitude, obedience, loyalty, and devotion.  It very rare to find such great masters who are willing to share their knowledge and have such purity of soul.  It's been a privilege and honor to be associated with them (as well as all the divine healers and teachers and students) and to help spread their message of universal service and love with healing.

I am a student of  Dr. Sha's. I was very honored and blessed to have been able to visit Dr. Guo's clinic in China, which was where some of the Soul Masters movie was filmed. Being at the clinic was an experience that I will always remember and treasure. As the film showed, Dr. Guo does tongue readings to determine what herbs are appropriate to heal your condition. When I arrived at Dr. Guo's clinic my tongue was slanted, which was an indication of poor circulation. After taking the herbs that Dr. Guo prescribed, my tongue straightened out and my health improved. It was amazing!

  The Soul Masters movie carries a message of immense hope.  At this time when the medical industry has priced itself out of the reach of so many, and the government's Medicare program is collapsing under the strain of the double whammy of overpriced medical services and the aging of the boomers; its time to acknowledge that our current medical model is rapidly reaching its limits.
 Its time to open our minds to a new paradigm.  These Soul Masters invite us to refocus our healing efforts on to the soul level.  They give us key concepts fundamental to healing previously untreatable chronic, degenerative and even terminal diseases.  They show us that these diseases that have not been treatable at the physical level, are treatable at the soul level.  I know this to be true from personal experience.
 A few months ago I was diagnosed with high blood pressure.  My doctor wanted to put me on medication for the rest of my life.  I decided that first I would try soul healing.  I registered for just 1 of Dr. Sha's Sunday afternoon ""Divine Group Remote Healing, Rejuvenation and Transformation Sessions"".
