8262346,4,B0016GOME2,"Womanizing doctor Samir (Salman Khan) always tells his girlfriends that he is married, so as to prevent any serious relationships.  When he falls in love with Sonia (Katrina Kaif) and wants to marry her, Samir tells her that he will get a divorce.  Sonia insists on meeting his wife first, so Samir persuades his nurse Naina (Sushmita Sen) to pretend to be his wife.  When Samir's mother (Beena Kak) arrives and discovers that he is ""married"", further complications ensue.  All the while, Sonia's neighbor (Soliel Khan) is trying to woo her, too.

Based on Hollywood's 1969 Cactus Flower, this romantic comedy is quite amusing.  While I wasn't impressed with all the music, I found some of the group choreography quite good.  Sen gave a great performance, and Salman Khan did well also.  While I'm not fond of the slapstick humor used by Soliel Khan in this movie, the chemistry between the brothers was fun to see.  Kaif is the weak link in this film.  Either she is a poor actress (I wasn't fond of her in Partner, either) or her role wasn't well written.  If you compare this film to the original, it doesn't stack up well; however, on it's own as an example of typical Bollywood, it's fun to watch.",1506643200,,1202,4.649289099526066

8262348,3,B0016GOME2,"I'm not a Salman fan, as such, though I must admit I've been buying and enjoying some of his movies lately. I only got this one for the little mentioned and underappreciated (in this film) Sushmita Sen, of whom I'm a major fan.

I do not care for Katrina Kaif in this film, at all. I am apparently not susceptible to her physical allure, nor do I find her the most beautiful (or Indian) of Bollywood actresses. To give her her due, though, she does well enough, given the grating, self-involved character she has to play here.

Salman gives one-third of what I feel he does best: comedy. Of late, except perhaps for the excellent Dabaang, he has eschewed the comedic aspect of himself and his acting, in my opinion much to the audience's detriment, for I feel he has a real flair in that area. But here at least he has scope, and uses it well, particularly in scenes with the also-undermentioned Sohail Khan, who is kindly and near-brilliant as Pyare.

The 2nd one-third of Salman that's here, that I *don't* like? His doe-eyed, sweet-as-pie act. I have never bought it from this actor, and never will. It simply seems fake to me. Unfortunately, it is on full display here at times. Admittedly it's a *romantic* comedy, so the role calls for it, but wish it could have been worked around, somehow. A sweet lover-boy avatar just doesn't suit SK, it seems to me.

And Salman's final one-third? It wasn't necessary for this sweet and romantic film, but it's action-hero guy, bully-boy, guy's guy, solid friend, decimator/terminator Salman. THAT guy is pure adrenaline. Dabaang managed to combine him with comedy-Salman, giving a most winning and appealing masala, leaving lover-boy SK hanging, all to the good. But it was a rare feat.

I rewatch MPKK from time to time for funny Pyarelal, beauteous Sush, and a couple of decent songs.",1402963200,,1831,4.709375
8262349,5,B0016GOME2,I love Salman Kahn. You have to like him to really enjoy the movie. But most people love him and his talent.,1389398400,,108,3.9545454545454546
8262350,5,B0016GOME2,"I absolutely loved this movie. Hindi films are so fun to watch. They always have an interesting storyline, and wonderful song and dance.",1386288000,,136,4.956521739130435
8262351,4,B0016GOME2,"Must see if you are a SK fan - This movie was made in 2005.  You can begin to see the trending in his  cinematic climb.  As always, you get the dance, the hips, and the shirtlessness - Sk's comedic timing is amazing and something he does well.

The music and choreography is very good as well as the wardrobe is contemporary and stylish.  All in all the movie is entertaining !",1359763200,2,377,4.180555555555555

8262353,5,B0016GOME2,"This is an entertaining movie. You should not search for reality. VERY Nice songs. New comedian did excellent- who pretended to be a lame to see Sushmita. If you like hindi movie, you can own it. Story line is not too bad: susmita is Salman's (doctor) receiptionist/nurse? Salman's girlfrind is Katrina. Salman uses susmita to cover up the story he made up once to katrina. Susmita then falls in love with salman. Salmans real brother loves katrina, who shows it sometimes. At last susmita becomes salmans girl, AFTER katrina (at the very end of the movie) start saying (in the middle of their wedding) that susmita loves salman too much- so he should go back to him.  When katrina says- susmita loves you - please go to ger - salman leaves the church immediately & searches for susmita!!!!(where they were getting married - though they are Hindu- because salman's mom was crying to an Idol). That seemed funny, because in the whole movie - salman didn't have any interest for susmita. Salman's mom's funny attitude was not too bad. Susmita's repeated broken dreams were the only realistic thing in the whole movie. Susmita looked absolutely fabulous, Salman too. I am not Katrina fan - so her innocent - cute baby type talking irritated me.",1177804800,,1241,4.799065420560748
