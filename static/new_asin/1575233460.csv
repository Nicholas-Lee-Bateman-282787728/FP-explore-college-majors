7798824,4,1575233460,I have loved Kari Wuhrer for about 20 years now so every once in awhile I would type her name because if anything she was in was on id record it. Well they didn't put the sexiest women on Earth on the air enough so I started buying her movies this movie was actually clever and entertaining and the main reason I bought it was to watch Kari Naked and she did not disappoint she had her implants in but 2 me and I always like seeing a lot of her ass not enough but if ur a Wuhrer Fan (I don't know what straight me shouldn't be) def watch it,1452124800,,540,3.873873873873874
7798825,1,1575233460,"I'm always drawn to Laura Linney movies.  I also like Liam Neeson and sometimes Antonio Banderas.  However, this movie's script was complete garbage, i.e., trite and unimaginative.  Truly, it has about 5 minutes of linear plot if whittled down.",1260835200,,244,5.205128205128205
7798826,1,1575233460,"...People didn't REALLY give this dreck positive reviews, did they?  It's a joke, right?

I watch a lot of movies, and I'm very forgiving of the bad and middle-of-the-road ones.  But this tested even my patience.  What a horrible waste of film, time, and talent!

I'm glad the ""Plot Synopsis"" above listed this as a ""romantic comedy"".  I kind of thought it was supposed to be funny, judging by some of the music that accompanied some scenes, but I wasn't sure.  There were no laughs, no giggles, not even any slight smiles elicited by this.  The only time I reacted was when my jaw dropped in amazement of how bad this movie was!  It is only 88 minutes long, but they were the longest 88 minutes of my life!

Bad acting, unbelievable plot and characters, and boring direction add up to...a lot of nothing.

If people watch this kind of stuff just to see Kari Wuhrer's assets, as appears to be the case, well, that is just sad.",1150848000,2,926,4.4523809523809526
7798827,2,1575233460,"This is just referring to the DVD:
I was waiting for this DVD to come out because I loved this movie when it first came out.  I rented it from a video store a few years back and really enjoyed it.  Well acted.  Good premise.  Not to mention, Kari Wuhrer is hotter than ever.
Yet, the DVD is a huge disappointment.  It's edited!  The video tape I rented was an unedited unrated version.  THIS DVD IS NOT!  It's the R-rated version.
Otherwise, I would have given it 4 stars!  I'll never understand why they edit these movies?  Ruins them.
Sex seems to be the only criterion for the MPAA to give out NC-17 and decline ratings.  Yet, violence has no limit.",1035331200,53,652,4.305785123966942
7798828,5,1575233460,"Extraordinary bleak take on dark and yearning co-dependency. Wonderfully written and expertly directed. Highly authentic characterizations. Slovin's first feature won Ft. Lauderdale's Golden Palm Award (Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival), and will surely be featured in retrospective repertory before 2030.",998697600,6,301,6.743589743589744
