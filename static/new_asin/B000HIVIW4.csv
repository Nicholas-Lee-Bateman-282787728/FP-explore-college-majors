2638257,2,B000HIVIW4,"I have to admit, this is a really bad movie. The only parts I enjoyed was watching Kevin Levrone. The fight scenes are horrible and the acting from the main characters poor. I watched it once and had to get rid of it.",1486512000,,217,4.069767441860465

2638259,2,B000HIVIW4,"Two CIA agents vacationing in Trinidad during carnival are hunted by various assassins in this ultra low budget action thriller.

I've lived in Trinidad for over a year now and only picked this up because of the setting.  Its pretty bad, there are some funny moments but most of those are due to the low budget or bad writing.  There's tons of cliches, unconvincing action and dull padding.

Its the sort of movie where the writer refers to the 'Republic of China' but means the People's Republic.  Where the US Marines run covert safe houses (rather than say the CIA), where an American woman can beat up a Trini cop in broaf daylight and no one cares, and where the bad guys fire thousands of bullets without hitting anyone so they fall back on Kung Fu.

It was fun seeing familiar streets and locations but no one from Trinidad has more than a line or two and other than the music and carnival footage there's nothing really Trinidadian about the film.

There's no nudity, no blood, laughable effects and a paper thin plot.

But I got some laughs so it wasn't a complete loss.",1353801600,8,1079,4.525773195876289
2638260,4,B000HIVIW4,I probably bought this dvd because of the front cover. There isn't any scenes in the movie with the cover but it is still a pretty good action thriller movie with good acting. I may even watch it a second time.,1269129600,2,210,4.146341463414634
2638261,4,B000HIVIW4,"This is an entertaining movie, not a great movie but worth watching. Keep an eye on the head FBI guy, Jay, played by Steve Boergadine. Let's hope we see more of him in the future.",1190764800,7,179,4.142857142857143

8139921,2,B000HIVIW4,"Lots & lots of gratuitous rump shaking for the adolescent-minded, captivated by twerking, doesn't make up for the absence of anything else much worth watching in this movie which is mostly ridiculous and cheesy. Couldn't even tell if its intentionally campy; if not then it takes itself too seriously, with the lead chick, while possessed of good looks, acting all smug.

8139925,4,B000HIVIW4,"Was there Bad in this ""Yes"", but it's a low budget movie filmed in Trinidad.
Glad to see Trinidad getting support in the movie biz & nice to see non-mainstream faces working.
Glad to see Mr. Kevin Levrone getting movie work & music credit.",1512518400,,239,4.454545454545454
