7871124,3,6304451326,"China's invasion of Tibet in 1959 resulted in the exile of that land's spiritual and political leader, the 14th Dalai Lama and the slow erosion of a unique culture. Tibet On The Edge of Change attempts to highlight Tibetan culture and show its slow demise since the invasion.
  As the viewer you are taken to this land where you are given a feel for the topography and the people who inhabit it. You witness a people who practice interdependence on one another for survival, have a reverance for the land, are subsistance farmers (barley and corn the main crops) and have developed a unique form of Buddhism. These practioners of peace created a culture where mutual respect was the norm.
  The next view you are given is that of the Chinese impact. Lands that were once heavily forrested are now stripped bare causing erosion problems. China introduced strip mining into the area causing further environmental problems. To make matters worse, China housed a nuclear dump into Tibet which no doubt will evoke more devestation upon the land.
  You see a glimpse of Tibetan culture as it attempts to survive under Chinese oppression but it appears as if Tibetan life is barely surviving. Now the Chinese outnumber the Tibetans who have become strangers in their own land.
  As a whole this video gives you a wide sweeping view of what is happening in Tibet but it lacks depth. Absent are the voices of the people who are undergoing this oppression. Even though you get an idea of the oppression going on you fail to get the feeling. In fact the Tibetans look and act like happy people content with their lot. The sense of urgency and the importance of this culture doesn't move you. You also don't get a feel of how Tibetan Culture has changed under Chinese rule.
  Despite those faults the video is good as a general introduction to Tibet and the impact of China on the country. If used in conjunction with other resources the viewer will receive a better understanding of the problems that Tibet is undergoing.",1013126400,4,2010,4.717142857142857
