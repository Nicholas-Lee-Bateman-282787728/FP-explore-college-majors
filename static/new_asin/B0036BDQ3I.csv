And the concert itself is boring. ""Men at work, live in san francisco or was it berkeley"" is a much, much better concert. Not sure if you can get it on dvd, but if you can find a good vhs copy of it, you will be glad you got it. And then you can put it on a dvd.",1330646400,,430,3.6847826086956523
8389761,3,B0036BDQ3I,"I got the DVD from Deep Discount.  No complaints about the seller.  The disc came quickly and was well packaged.

The concert had many of MAWs hits plus other lesser known songs.  Visual editing of the concert was well paced, no strobelight-like quick cuts between shots.  The look and sound of the material was less than crisp, however: like a second generation copy of a VHS original.  Sound a bit muffled and the video flat and oversaturated.

Concert video of this band is rare so this DVD is of value to fans but the presentation could have been better.",1297382400,5,558,4.575757575757576
