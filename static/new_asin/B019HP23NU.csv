8745215,1,B019HP23NU,If I could give it negative stars I would. The copy I received was obviously used and wouldn't play at all. Completely useless!,1503532800,,127,4.565217391304348
8745216,5,B019HP23NU,"We really enjoyed watching this Blu-ray! I have never been to Yellowstone or the Grand Teton area, so this was wonderful to watch & see the beauty of it as if I was there. The narrator, also gives a lot of helpful hints as to what times of day to go to different places to get the best shots of the scenes. This is something I hope my family & I can do in the next few years. I will definitely watch it again! I also enjoyed one of the Adams' other DVD's on Photographing Guatemala & the Mayan Ruins.",1475971200,,500,4.01
8745217,5,B019HP23NU,"This is better than Scenic Tour Grand Tetons , Yellowstone and 3 other highways.  More photos
better voiceover and the Blu ray is stunning having had the opportunity to see them all.
It feels just like being there. There are maybe 12 photo tips but don't let that put you off
you will love it.",1470700800,,293,4.327272727272727
8745218,5,B019HP23NU,"Enjoyed this Blu-Ray very much.  The photography is sharp and crystal clear, especially on the Blu-ray disc.  Produced in the ""Ken Burns"" style.  Many wonderful vistas and interesting features that you may not see in other productions.  The narration is by the person who created the video, Sharon Adams.  While not a professional narrator, she brings her passion for the project to the narration and gives it a nice folksy feel that adds to its charm.  She also imparts many helpful photography and videography tips along the way. She did a great job.  What I especially like about this video is its serene, calming nature.  It's an excellent and valuable alternative to all the murder and mayhem and graphic corpses that we see on cable TV every night.  I found it very relaxing to sit and watch this video and be taken to a place of serenity and calmness.  I love our national parks, and this video provides an excellent tour of some of our greatest scenic wonders.  Frankly, I think it's a heck of a bargain for under $10.00.",1463011200,,1029,4.661111111111111
8745219,5,B019HP23NU,"I love this  DVD so much that I have watched it over and over.  The music is upbeat, the photography is beautiful and the narration is interesting and fun.  If you are planning a trip to Yellowstone, this would be a wonderful DVD to view prior to going.  It shows a lot of interesting places to visit and helps you plan your trip.  This DVD offers a wide variety of topics such as travel and photography tips, wildlife, and the history of the park and it's features.  If you don't have the time or resources to visit  Yellowstone and the Tetons, this is your opportunity to see the beauty of these places from the comfort of your home. I love this DVD and have already purchased another one from Sharon Adams Studio.  I was equally delighted with the DVD ""Photographing Guatemala & the Maya Ruins"".  I highly recommend this  Blue Ray DVD.",1455062400,,838,4.453947368421052
8745220,5,B019HP23NU,"These are the vacation snaps and videos we all wish that we were capable of producing. The accompanying narrative conveys  along with the guidebook basics any traveler needs to feel confident -- many facts that reveal themselves only in experience and can make all the difference when you're actually there.  Youll learn, for example, how long it takes to cover an area comfortably (without rushing the picture-taking) and which times of day are most favorable for certain types of photography along the routes recommended.

Put together in a format that instructs gently, without detracting from the sheer pleasure of viewing it, this presentation functions on at least three levels: as spectacular and informative entertainment that everybody can enjoy; as a practical and inspirational template for travel planning; and as an expert reference for photographers who want to get the most out of a visit.

When given the opportunity to compare photos of the same landscape in different atmospheric conditions, I was reminded of Monets Haystacks and other series paintings in which his ultimate subject became the vagaries of light, with their play on color. Wouldnt we be lucky if hed been able to record just how he captured each effect?

To speak of artistry, I should mention having seen this in both DVD and Blu-Ray.  As a Blu-Ray newbie, I wasn't sure that it would really make any difference in the visual quality.  It does.",1454544000,,1430,5.059574468085106
8745221,5,B019HP23NU,"Now I can really plan my time better,  know what is important to take like
camera filters and the photo tips will save a lot of my photos from the trash bin.
It gives an 8 day trip in detail so you can lengthen or shorten your trip to
fit your needs.  Also the photos and video clips are great so it is really easy to
choose the places you want to see, what time of day etc.,  like being right there.
It does lack info on places to stay but still rates five stars.

8745223,4,B019HP23NU,Since I am unable to travel anymore these photographs as stunning and almost as if I am there myself.  It is hard to find photos taken by photographers who capture not only the scene but also the mood plus lots of great tips for travelers in the future.  I would like to have been able to see more shots of the wildlife but realize that it is hit and miss for many who visit the parks out there.,1452297600,,395,4.051282051282051
