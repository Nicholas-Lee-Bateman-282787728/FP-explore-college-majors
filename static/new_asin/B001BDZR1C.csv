8282723,5,B001BDZR1C,"The first 17+min is a review of  'Creative Force'. We -have- the other DVD if we need  a review! // Pat isn't the greatest teacher: His  riffs contain notes that aren't explained by the theories being discussed, his language is obtuse, & tho it's impressive, it's not instructive to hear so much unexplained riffing between comments. SO WHY FIVE STARS?  To witness the thought process  of a guy who plays so damn well! Jimmy Bruno & Robert Conti are two -top- players who are -much- more in tune with educational methods & language, but, to be blunt, they don't play  as well as Martino. Is the difference here, in this DVD? I hope so, I think so, & I hope to to grasp it: Skip to c52min for  some awe-inspiring single note instruction.",1292025600,,736,4.488721804511278
