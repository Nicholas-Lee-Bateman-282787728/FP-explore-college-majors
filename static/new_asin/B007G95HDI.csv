5084868,5,B007G95HDI,"Upon receiving Peggy Cappy's DVD I was hesitate not knowing if it would suit me. I am a sixty-four year old who walks every day and tries to stay healthy for my grandchildren. I did the first exercise of stretching and quickly felt the results in my body to know how out of shape I really was. Knowing walking alone just didn't cut it, that I needed to relax those muscles that Peggy talks about. I love the meditation at the end, it is truly a great DVD for anyone who is beginning Yoga as I am. I would say get this DVD (as advertised on PBS) and you will love it. There is so much on it to stretching, to meditation, bouncing, and using tension bands. Well worth the money compared to some of the nonsense out there. I hope this review helps since I also turn to reviews to see how people like different products, it's very helpful. Good luck, as I am thrilled with this DVD.",1344124800,238,878,4.201183431952662
5084869,5,B007G95HDI,"Good easy yoga.  I like that there are short sections, so you don't have to do the entire thing if you are short on time.  I like the strength part added with the resistance bands and the ending meditation.  Haven't had it long enough to see if helps bothersome areas.",1338681600,17,268,4.32
5084870,5,B007G95HDI,I was so happy to see this on Amazon - best price.  This EASY YOGA for EASING PAIN is a great workout.  I have vertigo so I can't do all the yoga workouts I used to do.  The older I get -63 - the more I need to stretch.  I felt like I got a good stretch workout from this DVD.

5084871,5,B007G95HDI,"It's no wonder that Peggy Cappy has improved so many people's lives through yoga. Although she is one of the world's masters, she makes yoga accessible to all--including people who've practiced it for years, but also those like me, who never did yoga until discovering her work. I've memorized her ""Yoga for the Heart"" DVD, because the sun salutations provide a great cardio workout that's easy to do at home or while travelling. I'm a big fan of her CDs as well, including the ones for Stress Relief, and for Easy Meditation. Well here is another winner! This DVD is nicely divided into sections so that you can focus on whatever part of your body needs most help. For me, it's hips and legs, and the lower-body workout in this DVD is terrific!  Already, after only a few sessions, my legs have stopped aching.  I've also noticed that the upper-body sequence is great for good posture as well as pain-relief. There's even a bonus section teaching a simple qi gong energizer that's convenient for when you just have a few minutes here or there. I've shared Peggy's DVDs and CDs with my neighbors, who then end up buying their own copies. In this one, as in all of them, Peggy's soothing voice and encouraging attitude make the experience a joy. And personally, I don't like workout DVDs by supermodel types. Peggy is of course extremely fit, as well as beautiful, yet she looks like a real person, which is so nice to see.",1337472000,109,1422,4.616600790513834
5084872,3,B007G95HDI,"This program was perfect for me since I am trying to regain some strength and flexability in my legs.
I love that I can do it from a chair and not get down on the floor. But it just seemed to go sooooo slow and (sorry) boring.
I know that is how yoga is done but it has to be a little fun to keep my attention.",1337385600,13,310,3.6417910447761193
5084873,4,B007G95HDI,Yoga is slower than msny other forms of exercise - more stretching than many./  This is even easier - lots of time in chairs - not all up and down using your legs - easier that a lot of other tapes/dvd.  Easier on older bones & joints.,1335139200,139,235,3.978723404255319
5084874,5,B007G95HDI,"Over 40 now, I have always been active, but this winter I had a sudden onset of back pain and weakness in my muscles. This DVD is not difficult, but the stretches you do, do amazing things for your body.  I could feel and briefly hear things realign the first time I used it.  With each use I gained even more flexibility, and pain dissipated after the first viewing and disappeared after the second!  Amazing... when you do the exercises you think they are so easy... but the results are literally healing! This DVD is for everyone - young or old!  Highly Recommend!
p.s. DVD works well on Mac.

Hello again... I see some follow-up questions are being asked, so posting the DVD description to clarify.

""In Easy Yoga for Easing Pain, Peggy provides a path to relief for you if you suffer from varying levels of pain in your muscles or joints. Peggy's newest routine demonstrates yoga movements that can increase your flexibility, reduce joint pain, even combat fatigue and enhance overall wellbeing.

Unrelenting joint pain can be a result of arthritis, injury, or repetitive motion, and it can affect anyone. All too often, pain becomes a vicious cycle, making us hesitant to be active.

This gentle yoga workout presents a reasonable plan to help pain sufferers overcome this cycle and transform their lives.

This four-part yoga routine includes:

Seated exercises and yoga poses for the upper body.
Seated exercise and yoga poses for the lower body.
Standing yoga sequence for the hips and legs, with the aid of a chair if needed.
Relaxation and meditation.

Plus, there are 3 BONUS sections on Easy Yoga for Easing Pain:

Resistance Band Exercise, using stretchy bands to both warm-up and strengthen core muscles in your shoulders, upper back, and chest.
Bounce and Shake, a tried-and-true, simple exercise from Qi Gong that is fun, easy, and has the ability to generate energy throughout your body.
Documentary: Meet Peggy's real-life students whose aches and pains were eased with the introduction of a simple yoga routine.

5084892,3,B007G95HDI,"I'd pretty much mastered Penny's Yoga for Arthritis DVD, so I thought I'd graduate to this one. Not my favorite. Warm up is too short for my liking and having been in severe pain before a joint replacement, there is no way someone in pain can do some of these exercises.  While I do like the hip exercises, the balance exercises would be nearly impossible for someone in pain. Now that I recovered, I'll practice to achieve the poses. Plus it's just too short in duration. About a quarter is relaxation. As for the production, one minor annoyance is that the camera concentrates on the faces and you're left guessing on placement of anything above or below the area the camera concentrates on. You never see the entire pose to check your own placement.",1507248000,9,752,4.611940298507463

She really cares for and wants what's best for her students. Her yoga is easy to do and I'm honest when I say that. I have purchased other videos from other teachers saying that video is for any beginner, they are not, Peggy's actually are. She has a regular exercise then a modified version of it. You can even modify most of her exercises to begin sitting in a chair then doing them
Normal as you strengthen your muscles. There are people doing these exercises who are anywhere to their 70-90years of age. Peggy is in a constant search for helping people. I would recommend her videos to anyone.",1504483200,2,728,4.5227272727272725

Some is done in a chair, some standing, and some laying down. At first this seemed easier than Ms. Cappy's ""Strength and Balance"" DVD, but it definitely still offers challenges for my 55 year old body. I shared it with someone who is much less agile and they thought it was hard - so it really is all in your perspective, since we all start in a different place physically. I have 2 of her DVD's so far and may buy more in the future... The feature about the benefits of yoga at the end is inspiring since it relates how normal, middle aged people, like me benefit from yoga.

She eases you into everything and you can tell that she knows how to help older people without hurting you. I will probably get more in this series after I do this for awhile. There is also bonus features on this using resistance bands I am finding very useful. I cannot say enough about how good this DVD is for people in pain and seniors who need to really start out slow. I still find it challenging even though I used to teach yoga myself, but that was a long time ago. I have arthiritic thumb joints and she doesn't strain any part of the body while still giving you a good workout. Too many yoga tapes are one downward dog , plank, and floor exercises after another which is almost impossible for some people who are older.

It definitely worked on the areas of the body that those of us with chronic pain need to address. After doing the video I could feel it in the areas where I usually carry a lot of tension. My only issue with the video was there were some parts where the camera was up too close when you needed to see a wider picture in order to follow along and mimic the movements, which got a bit frustrating, but it was only about 10% of the video. The guided relaxation/meditation at the end was better than I expected.

5085012,5,B007G95HDI,"I wanted to add to the reviews here because this DVD is already doing wonderful things for me.  I'm 30, and was diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis last year - I've had chronic pain issues for about 4 years.  Before my pain started, I loved yoga and had gotten into doing it regularly - I was still a beginner and most of what I did was quite gentle, but I knew what I was doing.  Over the last few years, whenever I've tried to do any kind of poses on my own or following my old favorite DVD's, no matter how gentle, I would be in pain afterward (and not the good kind of pain either).  It was extraordinarily frustrating, but I finally figured that I needed to find DVD routines specifically targeted for people with chronic pain and/or arthritis so that the poses that could hurt me or aggravate my pain could be automatically weeded out.

I saw this DVD here on Amazon, and after I read the description I was a bit skeptical.  The routines seemed fairly basic, on the shorter side, and the hurt pride part of me was sort of offended at the idea of doing yoga in a chair =).  Hard to get used to the limitations your body can set on you.  In any case, I decided to pick this up based solely on the reviews and how enthusiastic people seemed to be about Peggy Cappy's materials.

And the enthusiasm was warranted.  This ended up being precisely what I needed.  I needed a set of routines that could be strung together if I wanted to do them all the way through, or broken up if I only felt up to doing one or two at a time.  I actually didn't realize I needed this until I used the DVD =).  I also needed a practitioner who felt calming and friendly and like someone who's face I wanted to look at every day to get into a regular practice - so far so good, I really like her style.  And her sidekick who demonstrates alternative poses is pretty funny =).

Finally and most important, I really needed a routine that would get to the point and guide me carefully through poses that both respected the limitations of my body, but also challenged it to function better.  After making it all the way through her set of routines, I have to say this really does both.  I was pretty surprised.  Even the chair stuff really challenged my joints, muscles, and muscle attachments in a positive way.  The after-effect lasts for a few days - my anxiety has gone down, and I'm actually sore in a POSITIVE way that I remember from having done yoga before - she's gently challenging my body in a way it truly needed.

So in sum this is really great for me - if there's anyone out there who's story is similar to mine, this might be a great fit.  The only thing wrong with this DVD is that I wish there was more on it!",1437523200,16,2705,4.233918128654971
5085013,4,B007G95HDI,"I was able to rent this video from my local library, which I highly recommend doing if you're unsure if the workout is for you.  One thing I'd like to point out as deceptive is the picture on the front.  I almost passed it by because there's no way I can sit on the floor as she is doing in that picture.  However, the seated poses are in a chair - not on the floor.  Also, I'd like to point out that if you have Amazon Prime, you can get this on Prime Instant Video for $7.99.  A great video for those of us who have arthritis!  I took off one star because a large segment of the end of the video is wasted (in my opinion) on interviewing people who are in her classes.  While these interviews are encouraging, I can't see that I'd watch this segment more than once.  I'd rather have a program that spends more time on poses that I can work out with.  There is a segment using a resistance band, which is great, but she only shows two options for the band, both are for the arms.  I would have liked more using the band - maybe for the legs, too.",1437350400,,1047,4.0144927536231885

5085101,5,B007G95HDI,The exercises are great. I was surprised that my muscles were sore the next day. I have two pinched cervical nerves and a bad back. It did not exarcebate my pains. The opposite happened. The only pain I felt after was sore exercised muscles. The problem iis that this DVD is very low quality recording. Even at max volumen you need total silence to barely hear what she is saying. This is not a true problema because she is demonstrating the exercises and a guy is doing them right along. It's easy to understand just by viewing them. In addition it has some other exercises. If you are in your 50's or have a bad neck or back this is a perfect starter for yoga.,1403136000,3,662,4.304

5085106,2,B007G95HDI,"The moves seem easy enough, but the photography leaves a lot to be desired.  As a newbie to yoga, I need to see the moves she is talking about, especially as she changes to another positon, not the red spot on Jim's arm or a close-up of someone's face, when she's talking about a different position of the arms.  It just makes me angry to watch it & I know that's not the mindset I need for yoga. I can't even watch the whole thing.",1399334400,20,432,4.070588235294117

5085108,5,B007G95HDI,"Peggy Cappy is amazing.  She seems to ""get it"" where so many others do not understand what it is like for those of us with chronic pain. She goes just slow enough for us to keep up,  yet not so slow that we're bored.  Her voice is nice, and calming.  I've done many of these type of videos, but have lost interest in the first couple times that I did it....not so with this one.  I wake up WANTING to do yoga with Peggy!

Fibromyalgia has taken a good bit of my life, a good decade...and I KNOW the less I move, the LESS I MOVE. This video makes me WANT to move....and I feel better after I do the entire video!! It's amazing... :) I have hope that this video will begin to give me my life back.  I want to walk my dog without having to stop and take a pain break every 5 minutes.  I want to clean my kitchen floor without having to put pain patches all over my achey body.  I want to take a bath because I want a bath, not because I must have a medicated bath to ease the pain that seizes my entire body, from head to toe.  My wants are simple for most people...but for those of us with Chronic pain, it seems miraculous.

Finally a video that really motivates me.  Instead of taking my morning medications today, then laying back down for an hour for them to kick in, I did this video. This is a major thing for me....I actually did the exercises and stretching routines BEFORE my morning medictions kicked in.

I found that I felt much better than I have in the  MORNING than I have in a decade.  Mornings are notoriously bad for those of us with fibro and arthritis.  We've been in one position all night, and I can barely walk most mornings much less think about doing an exercise video.

You might want to invest in a foam block to use for some of the stretches because it works much better than a folded blanket that is the alternative.  You also need a stretch band/exercise band.  I got mine for free in physical therapy...Btw, THIS video has done more for me in two days than a month of physical therapy did!

If you  have chronic pain, fibro/arthritis/gout/RA/OA anything that causes your body pain, please do yourself a favor and spend the 10 bucks and do this video every day.  I will update in about a month, and I know that I will feel better...mind, and body!

I finally have hope....and that is saying a lot.  Fibro takes hope away from many of us....Peggy Cappy has found a way to give it back!! Saying this is a miracle is not a stretch for me!",1398124800,24,2463,4.191489361702128

5085115,5,B007G95HDI,This group of exercises is easily accessible to those of us who are older or who have chronic muscle &/or joint issues.  It does move VERY slowly.  When I am having a flair of my chronic fibromyalgia it is tempting to take a pain pill and just sit.  Going through this very gentle series of moves (more like stretches and flexings) does lower the pain and help me feel more able to go about my day.

My husband walked in and didn't see it, just heard her and said ""she needs to go slower"". I thought the breathing was suppose to be slow and deep, I almost felt like I was panting to keep up.

5085205,5,B007G95HDI,"This particular DVD I like to use in addition to Back Care Basics, by Peggy Cappy. She has a wonderful delivery about her which is why I can see why her students rave about her and about yoga in general. The segments are divided up into 4 and 3 Bonuses at the end. I especially like that Parts 1 and 2 (upper and lower body exercises) are done sitting in a chair as I have trouble with balance. These exercises are great for my shoulders, neck and back. Part 3 gives me a great workout on my hips and legs and I always look forward to the relaxation and meditation at the end.

The Bonus features are cool, too. My favorite is the Bounce and Shake. That one wakes me up and gets me going in the morning. I also enjoy listening to Peggy's students rave about her and about what yoga has done for them.

The exercises are great for easing my fibromyalgia and back pain. A must have for chronic pain sufferers.",1348704000,8,907,4.206896551724138
