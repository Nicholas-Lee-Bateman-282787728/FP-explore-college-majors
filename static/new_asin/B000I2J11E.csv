8143643,5,B000I2J11E,This DVD was done by an amather but it was done to greatly help to me to parpare for the born of the puppies.  I didn't completely follow the procedures as shown but each case requires different procedures.  But this DVD was a very good guide.,1359504000,,243,4.260869565217392
8143644,5,B000I2J11E,"""We are first time breeders looking for information to help us prepare for the event and build our confidence. This DVD was everything it was advertised to be and more. As they say, a picture (or video) is worth a thousand words. The fact that this was a home made video did not detract at all from it's value. We give it 2 thumbs up !!!""",1273449600,,338,4.136363636363637
8143645,4,B000I2J11E,"This was purchased to inform and educate a prospective new breeder. It was
very informative and covered the areas we wanted to apprise the new breeder of. We are very satisfied with this DVD.",1246406400,,191,4.647058823529412
8143646,2,B000I2J11E,"I think this is an over priced ...POOR QUALITY HOME VIDEO...!

  It offers some info and shows a whelping; however, there are better

products...

  IE... Dr. Robert Hutchison's ""Successful Whelping..."" or

  FAWN RUN CORP. ... ""SPECIAL DELIVERY"", more information for your

  money.",1203206400,2,283,5.4523809523809526
8143647,5,B000I2J11E,"We were days from our Shih Tzu having her first litter and were concerned about complications. We got this DVD and the ebook it comes with and were much better off because of all the information it provided. It showed pre-birth preparations, the puppies being born, and what to do to once they come out. This was made from a breeder who did the video and showed very clear intsructions. All our puppies were healthy and we thank him very much for making this available to people that need to know more about whelping.",1195603200,4,517,4.51063829787234
8143648,4,B000I2J11E,"It is a home made video, but is worth every penny!  I saw exactly what I wanted to see and it was very helpful. I know what to expect when my little girl has her first litter.  And I'm sure I'll be watching it a few more times.  Thanks for all your time and effort.",1194393600,3,265,3.7818181818181817
8143649,3,B000I2J11E,"I just finished viewing the DVD and was totally surprised to find it to be a home video.  For $43 a consumer expects more.  $19.99 or less would have been a much more resonable price.  I truly expected a hospital setting with vet on hand for the price I paid.  The DVD comes in a plain clear case with no cover or attaching literature.  You only catch a glimpse of the man holding the camera.  I'm torn on how to write this review because I wanted to see a whelping video and I did.  What I'm upset about boils down to the price vs. the quality.  If the video was $15.99, then I would have given it 5 stars even with the shaky camera shots.",1173312000,4,640,4.064
8143650,5,B000I2J11E,I am so glad I found this DVD!  Our dog was due in a couple weeks and this video showed the entire process of before the labor and the actual delivery of the puppies.  The breeder did a great job of explaining what supplies we needed and of the step-by-step instructions he provided in order to have a successful litter.  This was well worth the money and an invaluable service!  We had 6 Healthy Pups!  Thank you so much!,1172966400,,422,4.291139240506329
8143651,4,B000I2J11E,"I bought this DVD because I have a pregnant dog, and I'm excited and nervous about the birth.  This DVD does show an actual whelping, from early signs of labor (panting and shaking), to contractions and restlessness, and on to several births and how the Mom dog cleans the pup and severs the cord.  The dam has 9 pups!  So it was very helpful for me to see what the pups in their sacs look like when they protrude and are pushed out.  Also, to see how they lie and look very limp at times, between birth and the first wiggle.  So I feel more prepared with what to expect.

This DVD would not take the place of having and reading at least a few books on the subject.  There are a lot of circumstances that can arise that are not addressed.  It is not by any means a comprehensive course on whelping, and does not cover the actual breeding act at all, or the raising of the pups.

This DVD is very obviously a ""home video""  in quality and cinematography.  The man filming is alone, assisting in the birthing while holding the camera.  So at times you can't see what is happening because his attention is on the dogs.  But if you are wondering if you can handle assisting your dog through whelping, or just want to see what it all looks like, it is very helpful.  I would say it is grossly over-priced.  But from what I can tell, it is the only one of it's kind available through this site.",1172880000,5,1387,4.220532319391635
8143652,5,B000I2J11E,"I found this video extremely valuable in making a decision if breeding is right for me and my dog.  It takes you from preparing for the puppy whelping, labor, puppy whelping, and the care of the puppies afterward.  This video is excellent and highly recommended for all potential breeders of dogs. This video is highly graffic and shows the entire birth. It is also great for those who would like to know how their puppy was born and cared for before it came to your home.",1169856000,3,472,4.476744186046512
