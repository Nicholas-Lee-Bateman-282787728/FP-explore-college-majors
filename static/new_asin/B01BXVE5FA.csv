8751920,5,B01BXVE5FA,"There were a great many film comedians, such as Charlie Chaplin, Mabel Normand, Roscoe Arbuckle, Charley Chase and Harry Langdon, who started their careers at Mack Sennett's studio in the 1910s and '20s. Many of them moved on to greater success and fame after leaving Sennett. Although Sennett was a producer who recognized talent, he didn't want to pay his comedians very much, so they mostly moved on. There were were also many comedians at Sennett who gained some moderate fame, but never became big enough to maintain a starring career, but continued to delight audiences with their supporting and sometimes starring roles in shorts. One of these funny men was Mack Swain. Sometimes he was the main attraction, and other times he appeared as a support for other comedians. Chaplin used Swain in some of his films in the 1920s (Pay Day, The Pilgrim, and The Gold Rush), years after he had left Sennett. Chaplin recognized Swain as a very talented and expressive comic actor who played well against his own onscreen character.

This DVD is a nice collection of seven shorts from the mid-1910s at Sennett's Keystone studio, six of which star Mack Swain. It is nice to be able to have these delightfully silly movies to watch and laugh at. The seventh film doesn't have Mack Swain, but that's all right, because the last one, with Harry McCoy, a young Mae Busch and Del Henderson, is a good Keystone comedy and action short as well. The disc presents the films with recordings of happy silent film music, and give us a fun little Mack Swain film festival. These shorts are presented without any extra features, but the DVD is economically-priced and well worth the purchase. I'm glad to have this one.",1486166400,3,1701,4.785714285714286
