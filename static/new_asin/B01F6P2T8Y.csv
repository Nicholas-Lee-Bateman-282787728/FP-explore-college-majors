7749236,5,B01F6P2T8Y,Came in sooner than expected. I absolutly love rewatching this anime. Certainly my absolute most favorite and will always be partial to me. I would more than recommend this to any and all anime fans. Though the wait was longer than I would prefere it was certainly worth it.,1468368000,6,274,4.612244897959184
7749237,5,B01F6P2T8Y,It's an awesome show. I love it!,1464048000,2,32,3.7142857142857144
7749238,2,B01F6P2T8Y,Only recived 2 disc in a four disc case and says seasons 1&2+ova on case but season 2 does not exist yet so I felt ripped off when I first opened the case and only got season 1 and ova' s in it. But I still like the anime and looking forward to when season 2 ACUALLY comes out.,1485302400,,277,3.711864406779661
7749239,2,B01F6P2T8Y,"I feel as if I was cheated out of the second season. The case was made to hold 4 disc's but it only has 2 inside of it. Also, I only have the first season of the seven deadly sins.",1484870400,,180,3.525
7749240,3,B01F6P2T8Y,"Excited I got the dvds but it was only season 1. It's a Netflix exclusive series and on there it only has season one, so I was stoked when I found this DVD and it said it had both, thinking I'd get a her start on season 2 I ordered it. But when it came it left off where it did on netflix, so looks like I'll keep waiting for season 2. Had I known it was only season 1, I probably would've kept looking. 24 bucks is kinda pricey for just the first season I think, but still happy I have it.",1478476800,4,490,3.766990291262136
7749241,5,B01F6P2T8Y,Can't get a nuff of it .,1476403200,,24,2.5714285714285716
7749242,3,B01F6P2T8Y,"They are a booted legged DvD set,but on the up side they are well made. 2 disks in 4 case box, the box it self is not boot legged but the disks are.",1475798400,2,148,3.515151515151515
7749243,4,B01F6P2T8Y,Great show but the set doesn't have a slip case so it doesn't shut right,1475020800,,72,3.8666666666666667
7749244,5,B01F6P2T8Y,"Showed up earlier then expected, it was in great condition and works really well. The only problem I had was on the second disk a character said a name and it glitched while saying that but the rest worked fine.",1474156800,2,211,4.3
7749245,5,B01F6P2T8Y,"A most entertaining anime. It was suggested to me by a friend, and I am forever grateful. Wonderful characters, interesting story lines,lots of laughs, and a few tears. What's not to love? This is listed as season 1 and 2, but my understanding is that it was one long season, 24 episodes and 2 OVAs. This becomes a bit more important, because I've now heard that they're doing another season! Hopefully they will answer the couple of questions they left hanging with the last episode. Don't let that stop you from purchasing it! I own a LOT of anime, and this series is definitely  now one of my favorites.",1473811200,9,606,4.559633027522936
7749246,1,B01F6P2T8Y,"Disappointed. There are 4 discs, i only received 2. Also, there were spot of white out on disc one. I waited a month just to be let down.",1473638400,2,137,3.9285714285714284
7749247,1,B01F6P2T8Y,Bootlegged. Nuff said. This show doesnt exist in any way that you can own. Funimation has all the rights to this epic show. i bought a realy ugly bootleg and knew it right away,1473120000,4,176,4.205882352941177
8760338,1,B01F6P2T8Y,this is NOT season two! it is still season one,1536364800,,46,3.7
8760339,1,B01F6P2T8Y,The page stated it was season 2 and the minute I found out that wasn't the case I couldn't refund it.  No option to refund after clicking the first episode and finding out 30 seconds in.  The order says season 1 part 2.  The main page states season 2.  Obfuscation is not good.,1530921600,,277,4.169811320754717
8760340,3,B01F6P2T8Y,The Anime gets 5 stars but because Amazon decided to put it as Season 1 and 2 it loses stars. I was excited to see season 2 but then remembered that its not in America yet. Then i saw that its really Season 1 split up,1527379200,,217,3.739130434782609
8760341,5,B01F6P2T8Y,Can't wait for the next season best anime in qight some time,1520121600,,60,4.083333333333333
8760342,2,B01F6P2T8Y,Love the series. Advertised and charged for seasons 1 & 2 but only got season 1. Wasn't happy about it.,1506384000,,103,4.2

8760344,5,B01F6P2T8Y,Came alot sooner than expected. The only thing wrong was it said seasons 1and 2 when it only was season 1.,1495584000,,106,4.095238095238095
8760345,5,B01F6P2T8Y,"A current fav.  Kudo's to offer an English dub version of this too.  I prefer to WATCH movies, not READ them (#notasubtitlesfan).  Enjoy watching this series.  :)",1487548800,,162,4.888888888888889
8760346,1,B01F6P2T8Y,This sounds like a boot leg,1486944000,,27,3.6666666666666665
