7453561,3,B015XC8IFI,"There was a time, nearly every Saturday morning aroung 10 a.m.. with my allowance of a shiny Franklin half and Washington quarter, one or two friends in tow, we'd head to the local theatre for the Saturday Matinee. I can still smell the popcorn, taste the Long Boys and Raisinets purchased at the concession stand. At that hour of the day the theatre would not be full, so we had choice seating. The program always included an old Republic serial that was shown in chapters, a couple WB cartoons and a triple feature of westerns, more often than not, from Poverty Row. Individually, we all had our favorites, Lash LaRue, Rocky Lane, Rex Allen, Randolph Scott, Tim Holt, Charles Starrett and Wild Bill Elliott, ( No singing Cowboys for us ) , which brings me to this collection of movies of one of my favorite at the time. As I have just finished watching the first disc, a thought suddenly occurred, of how unimportant things are when you are 10 years old. Case in point, like how a six shooter can sometimes fire 20 to 25 times without reloading, or how the locations of towns in Wyoming, Texas, Kansas, California, Missouri could all have that same mountain in the background with those telephone pole visible in many of the shots, or how there are very define shadows for the scenes supposedly shot at night, or how that one tree is growing in every town of every movie on the movies I've watched so far. It was driving me crazy until I realized I was watching these things instead of the movie. When I was 10, these movies did exactly what they were designed to do, entertain a lot of little kids in a theatre on a Saturday morning and a lot of adults who needed a little respite from the world outside for an hour or so. So I've made peace with seeing the same actors / actresses in every movie in one variation or another and just sit back and laugh at some of the things I once thought were so thrilling and watch as this peace loving man go about enacting and levying justice throughout the west of another era and remember the three of us sitting there rooting and shouting at each fist fight or shootout ( man, they were terrible marksmen ). Those were happy days and I wish they would bring more of these old B Westerns and serials back, because they can never bring back the good times we enjoyed then, but these compilations and packages certainly bring back a lot of good memories even if Texas looks exactly like Oregon and the shadow issue need explaining, I still think you'll enjoy these movies. You'll never confuse it with Shane, but sometimes you just want to kick back and enjoy The rde.",1459728000,8,2609,4.460251046025105
7453562,4,B015XC8IFI,I have been a fan of `Wild' Bill Elliott since childhood and I found this collection of some of his last western films to be quite good.,1457740800,,136,4.074074074074074
7453563,5,B015XC8IFI,"As B. Cathey says, this is a must for western fans. Warner Archive have given us 8, yes 8, Allied Artists Elliott westerns, all in excellent B/W transfers (were they ever in Sepia, I missed that) 4.3 ratio. Obviously these will appeal more to the retrospective collector, and lover of ""B"" films, but these are prime examples of how a good cheap western can be still great viewing. Yes the films have the same actors, but who doesn't like to see Phyllis Coates, Myron Healey, Terry Frost, Stan Jolley, Marjorie Lord, Peggy Stewart, Lane Bradford and good old Denver Pyle? Plenty of action in all 8 films, tho ""The Maverick"" is perhaps not so action packed. I have enjoyed them all and wonder what will happen to the missing one?",1454284800,7,727,4.6
7453564,3,B015XC8IFI,"It was a great collection of Wild Bill Elliott movies, however I was disappointed that the movies which  were originally filmed in Sepiatone were presented in black and White",1449014400,,174,5.0
7453565,5,B015XC8IFI,Very happy with the Wild Bill Elliott collection. All movies are in excellent viewing condition and very enjoyable to watch. Pleased with purchase and can recommend this collection.,1448236800,6,181,5.5
7453566,5,B015XC8IFI,Definitely worth the money. Wild Bill was the epitome of the hero cowboy of the 1950's.,1448064000,,87,4.5
7453567,5,B015XC8IFI,"I own the set, and I can say that any fan of Wild Bill Elliott, any fan of more hard-hitting, no-nonsense ""better B-Western"" action, will not be disappointed. Actually, these oaters are part of eleven that Elliott made with Monogram/Allied Artists between 1950 and 1954, after a long relationship with the Republic Studio organization (1943-1950) and previous to that, Columbia (1938-1942). Before leaving Republic, Wild Bill had made some larger-budgeted ""A"" Westerns, which were once generally available on Republic VHS cassettes (but have not appeared on DVD yet...who owns the rights? Perhaps Olive Films, and if so, will they release them?).
But back to this release; Warner Archive had already released FARGO and THE HOMESTEADERS in this series, and here we have three discs with eight more (now only missing BITTER CREEK). First, as to the quality: these films are in very good black and white transfers. I didn't notice any real imperfections. Second, the films are all full screen. Third, production values are acceptable. The films appear to have been made at Monogram's ""ranch.""
As to the films, themselves, and the acting, well, if anything Wild Bill is even more austere and hard-nosed than previously. These films are  a good ways from the earlier, more lyrical B-Westerns of the 1940s. Although you will see a panoply of familiar Western actors (e.g., Denver Pyle, Stanford Jolley, Fuzzy Knight, etc.), Elliott travels without the proverbial side-kick....there is no Gabby Hayes comedic figure. And most of the time he doesn't smile, at least not much. But he does always have a goal and an objective, and he will stop at nothing to secure it.
Dialogue, as befits the character, is spartan and direct, but Elliott knows this genre in and out, and when he speaks, he speaks with authority and, I find, with almost a mesmerizing effect.
For the most part, the plots of these ""bigger Bs"" are tight and the action is plentiful. Romance does occur, but it is a definitive side-show, if existent at all. Some of the supposed historical situations (as in REBEL CITY) are really outside belief, but the action itself is non-stop and well-woven, well-presenting the plot line...and very satisfying.
In some ways, this series of Wild Bill's final Westerns leads us into the era of realistic, ""adult"" TV Westerns, such as THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WYATT EARP or GUNSMOKE. Yet these  films still possess something of the feel of the older Bs. Most of them time out between 63 and 74 minutes.
So, I can strongly and highly  recommend this set to those who enjoy good Western action, and in particular, Wild Bill Elliott. Thank you, Warner Archive!",1446768000,16,2645,4.966139954853273
7453568,3,B015XC8IFI,"I haven't bought this yet and there are no other reviews here but if it may help , my dear late departed father used to mention this dude among other names such as Tom Mix and Lash La rue so his name is in good company. I am over the moon that I will at last get a chance to see this guy in action as I have only seen stills of him. Delighted and cant wait to purchase. I couldn't comment without including a star and as I could be negative I just gave it a three, but I promise to return as soon as I get my sweaty paws on this and review the disc then.",1446508800,3,554,3.7033898305084745
8734984,3,B015XC8IFI,"Having seen Elliott's post Red Ryder western efforts on Republic I was hoping for films on the level of Hellfire, The Showdown, The Last Bandit, The Savage Horde, etc. but these simply don't reach those heights. The Republic films were essentially A westerns with stronger supporting casts and some were shot in color. These Monogram films are clearly a step back into the B western and lower production values, lesser known supporting players, and B&W. All of them are certainly solid B films but there is no mistaking the lower quality which Monogram was known for and one misses actors such as Walter Brennan, Forrest Tucker, and Jim Davis. Many of these seem to feature the same supporting cast with only different female leads. Elliott himself is still quite good though a bit more taciturn than in the Republic films. The one notable exception is the final western in the Monogram series, The Forty- Niners. Benefitting immensely from a strong supporting role and performance from Harry Morgan and solid turns from Virginia Grey and John Doucette this film is more along the lines of my expectation. The print quality on all the films is very nice. With a little more of a working budget to upgrade the casts these could have been quite good. In short, if you are looking for A level westerns you will likely be disappointed but if you are a B western fan or a diehard Elliott fan there should be hours of entertainment for you here.",1534809600,,1439,4.7370517928286855
