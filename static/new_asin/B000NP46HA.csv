8180380,4,B000NP46HA,"This DVD has some great Small Circle Jujitsu techniques, although if you've been practicing MA for a while ""Foundation Techniques"" may be a better title. If you're already familiar with S.C. Jujitsu then Prof. Wally Jay and Leon Jay need no introduction. The techniques and instruction performed by Leon Jay is clear and easily understood with some great variations on defenses from the push and the strike. Some are very simple while others, involving pressure point attacks can require a bit more knowledge and practice to do effectively. Because I know how much fulcrum activation can hurt, I hesitate to comment on Mr Jay's assistant. Suffice to say his demonstration of pain is very pronounced in each move. The production of the video is not as slick as your latest (insert Star's name here) Workout video, but the information you'll gain outweighs any distraction there. The video homage to Prof. Wally Jay at the end of the instruction section is an interesting watch.",1238025600,6,976,4.993865030674846
