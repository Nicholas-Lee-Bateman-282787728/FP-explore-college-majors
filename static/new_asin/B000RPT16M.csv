2874824,5,B000RPT16M,"I ordered this from Truckerflicks and disagree with the other reviewer 100%, this turned out to be a fine DVD for a movie I remember seeing on TV in the late 70's and have been hunting for years to find on DVD.. of course the old beat up VHS rentals have been offered up for sale at insane prices for many years now it's actually affordable for someone like me to own.
The movie is a classic example of one of the 70's made for TV movies meant to capitalize of the popularity of the Smokey and the Bandit films, there were many popping up in the mid-late 70's and early 80's, this was always one of my favorites.
The DVD arrived new and sealed, it's just a basic barebones DVD, nothing special about it, menu with chapter selections and that's about it.
DVD playback was fine, although I really hate Full Screen DVD's there just comes a time when you have to accept some stuff was never made in Widescreen and therefore will never be available in anything but Full Screen. Picture quality was fine, a bit grainy as expected for an old made for TV movie and the audio was just a standard 2 channel stereo simulated track. (low budget TV shows and movies in the 70's were Mono only so they wouldn't have been filmed with a stereo soundtrack)
If you like this movie you should also check out ""Big Bob Johnson and His Fantastic Speed Circus"" also available from Truckerflicks.
Overall I was very pleased with what I got, unlike the other reviewer I would like to say THANK YOU to Truckerflicks (if you should ever read this) for finally making this long lost classic piece of 70's truck driving nostalgia available,  it's been readily available for sale on Amazon, the Truckerflicks web site, and several other sites as well, so again the other reviewer is incorrect in saying it's out of print or the MGM B.S., A quick search on the Internet Movie Database shows this movie as having nothing to do with MGM and that Truckerflicks is the US Distributor, as a matter of fact after looking at his review of this DVD and looking at other reviews he has done it's apparent he has nothing but hate for small independent DVD companies like Truckerflicks and apparently writes the same type of review whenever he comes across one, (although the toothless part was funny I must admit)his review was completely misleading and to me seamed like he didn't even watch it and was basing it on the box cover which of course is not the way you should review something, you should at least have seen it before writing a review, I picture Sam Franklin (the other reviewer)as someone with no life, sitting behind his computer 24 hours a day, a coffee pot,fridge,bed pan, and ""pee"" bottle next to him.. everything so he never has to leave his precious PC for anything... His eyes are as big as silver dollars and about to bug out of his head, bloodshot from no sleep and too much caffeine, pouring sweat from head to toe as he constantly scours the Internet looking for low budget DVD productions to complain about... Sam.. Get a life",1214179200,4,3011,4.504570383912249
2874825,1,B000RPT16M,"Why, why, why, WHY does Amazon keep stocking junk like this? Look at the cover of this DVD(-R): it's SO obvious that the supposed 'producer' (Truckerflicks, whoever that is - I picture some toothless hillbilly in a trailer living next to a truckstop in the Texas panhandle - yes, you are welcome to take that personally, Truckerflicks, should you ever bother to read this) of this title has merely stretched the original artwork for the VHS to fit a DVD sleeve. Talk about lazy! No doubt the disc was also 'mastered' from this same VHS source, so you know you're getting 'real' quality. Notice, too, how it's already 'out of print', i.e. Truckerflicks has received a cease-&-desist from the actual copyright owner (MGM). PURE JUNK.",1211241600,4,731,4.856
