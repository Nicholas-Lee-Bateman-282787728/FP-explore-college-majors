7863195,5,6304165242,"I have agree with a previous reviewer---in a lefted-handed way. If you are an evangelical christian who rejects the very foundation of modern biology--the fact of evolution (some people misunderstand the meaning of ""theory"" as ""idea"" or ""opinion"")--then this video (and series) is not for you. Created by the BBC as a general introduction to scientific concepts, this series uses established scientific facts to teach children (and, occasionally, adults) about the world in which we live.

My wife picked up this video at a library sale, and it quickly became my young son's favorite video. He can now not only name many more mammals but is better at understanding the logic of the zoological classification system.

If you want to help your child become a critical-thinking and broadly educated person, then this video is a welcome addition to your collection.",1147305600,2,861,5.142857142857143
7863196,5,6304165242,"Both my 4 year old & 7 year old love the Eyewitness videos.  Mammal does a great job of covering the variations in mammals in a way that not only engages my kids, even with repeated viewings, but also wear well on Mom & Dad.  My kids have really learned from this video (& others in the series) and have held their own in conversations using info they got from Eyewitness.  Despite a ""reccommended"" older age group for the companion books, the videos are ok for for 4-5+ (depending on their interest level).  My kids always have Eyewitness Videos on their Wish Lists.",1014336000,5,567,4.475728155339806
