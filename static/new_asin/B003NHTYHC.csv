4159749,3,B003NHTYHC,"This is a prime example of mis-marketing.  The movie cover and promo info would have you thinking that this is a fast-paced movie with copious amounts of Capoeira and conflict.  Could not be further from the case.  This is a historical drama, and while this could present the opportunity for depth and characterization, this film, quite frankly, is slower than a crippled slug.  Capoeira is used fairly often, but only in brief flashes.  Just when you think something is about to happen, it cuts to another melodramatic 5-minute ""why does life suck so much"" scene.  The highlight is a 5-minute fierce Capoeira fight at the film's climax in the jungle, but this is about as close to the advertising as it gets.

It is based on a true story, however, and Brazil and its version of the Portuguese language are as gorgeous as ever.  Worth a rental, but definitely not a purchase.  If you're a Capoeira fan, you're still better off sticking with ""Only the Strong"" until something better comes along.",1279065600,,994,4.766081871345029

8401211,5,B003NHTYHC,"Struggle is something I can relate to, whether historically or personally. In spite of obstacles, I am more than a conqueror much like Besouro and his people.

I also love Capoeira!",1384387200,,181,4.838709677419355
8401212,5,B003NHTYHC,"Besouro - also known as The Assailant, is a unique and wonderful experience. It's about a orphan name Manoel, who learned Capoeira from his master and he got so good at it he was considered a legend. Known as the beetle, an insect who's body was so heavy, there was no way it could possibly fly - but it did and so Manoel was called Beetle because he seemed to defy gravity and was one of the best at Capoeira. On the Brazil plantations in the 1920's, the workers were oppressed, beaten and suffered at the hands of the plantation owners. Because they feared Capoeira, they sough to punish and kill  anyone who practiced it in fear it might cause a rebellion. After Beetle's master was assassinated, he vowed to use his skills to fight against the plantation owners and empower his people. This movie is about not being scared to do what has to be done. It has some sexy scenes, the cinematography was nice and the plot and story line was nice, as well. I liked the movie because it was beautifully shot, had great fight scenes, and about one man having the strength to do what is right/necessary. I learned a lot about the African slaves and the Portuguese colonists in Brazil in the old days. And more importantly - the dance, the fighting style called Capoeira. It's a very unique and moving film.",1354924800,,1300,4.485232067510548
8401213,5,B003NHTYHC,A very good movie - hands down a rare find for those who look outside the box.  The link to ancient African spiritual belief system is golden,1331596800,,141,4.222222222222222
8401214,4,B003NHTYHC,Excellent film with very creative visuals - though I think the build up towards the conclusion could have been done better! Its a beautiful film worth to be in your collection!,1324944000,,176,4.709677419354839
8401215,5,B003NHTYHC,The movie was great it did a good job showing the struggle that Brazillian people had to endure to keep Capeoria alive,1313798400,,118,4.409090909090909
8401216,5,B003NHTYHC,"One of the biggest films ever made in Brazil. Out of 10 stars, I'd give it 9. Its a great movie about the spirit and perseverance of a man. Its not an all out fight-fest, although there is a lot of action and fighting. This movie rises above that to depict a real-life hero who fought for his people against the white plantation owners in 1920s Brazil. Great scenery and photography. The star is a Capoeira champion in Brazil. This DVD is great. Fantastic packaging with a slipcase, great video and audio, perfect subtitles, and a lot of English-subtitled special features. This DVD is all-region and worked just fine on my USA DVD player. Recommended.",1296000000,7,652,4.678260869565217

8401218,5,B003NHTYHC,"This was an excellent movie with every scene beautifully presented. This movie is not only about Besouro (a factual figure in Afro-Brazilian history) and the art of capoeira, but it provides beautiful insight to the Candomble culture itself. As a Yoruba priest of Obatala I really enjoyed how the movie wrapped the drama around the Orishas (Orixa). I understand some folks were looking for a drag-down, kick-boxing, martial arts film, and were disappointed. Me...I really enjoyed this movie. If you enjoy capoeira then check this movie out. I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you enjoy movies presenting interesting images of Candomble culture, then check this movie out. If you just enjoy a good movie, then check this out. Well done.

8401219,4,B003NHTYHC,"Many Capoeira students knew this was going to be more of a history/folklore movie than an action movie. Besouro is a good movie; and while some viewers may expect more it is much better than Only The Strong... All I can say to Mr Celebi, who had certain expectations because of the DVD cover, welcome to your first capoeira experience, LOL.",1279411200,3,340,4.590163934426229
