It was disappointing that they would combine some high school AV class garbage with first-take dubbing over public domain vids then expect people to finish watching it let alone enjoy it. They suckered me in with the great ninja gaiden imagery on that awesome retro cover and ok youtube trailer but lost my respect half way through the first episode.  Are all the other reviews from their mothers and best friends? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading the (currently) 100% 5-star reviews.

Sorry dudes I'm realizing this is pretty harsh but I gotta break this undeserved perfect ratings streak so no-one gets suckered into paying $23 for what should have been edited down into a few unpopular youtube clips.",1413849600,,859,4.72

8546896,4,B00A6GCJHK,"Ninjas are automatically awesome -- just about anything in life can be improved by adding ninjas to it. The same is also true of Vikings, but that's not really applicable here.

So expect uber-ninjafication in ""Ninja the Mission Force: The Complete First Season,"" a clever web series that overdubs footage from public-domain movies so that they're all about ninjas -- sci-fi, gladiators, cheese and exorcisms all get the ninja treatment. But the real plot involves an evil ninja master who wants ultimate ninja power. Ninja ninja ninja, ninja ninja.

The evil ninja Bruce (Brad Jones) is seeking the Avian Ninja Warriors, so he can have ultimate ninja power (and no, I don't really know what that means). But he soon runs afoul of Gordon (Ed Glaser), a former ninja who possesses one of the Avian Ninja Warriors -- and after a clash with a Cheese Ninja, he is pulled back into a war with the Evil Ninja Empire.

So now Gordon and his allies must battle the Evil Ninja Empire in a variety of disguises, in a variety of different movies -- they must infiltrate the Mafia, track down cheese smugglers, head into space, exorcize Chinese heartburn, thwart an zombie virus, and battle a tiny robot. Will Gordon be killed until death, or will he stop Bruce until he doesn't succeed?

I'm surprised more people haven't done comical overdubs of public-domain movies, especially to insert extra ninjaness into the story. ""Ninja the Mission Force"" centers each episode around carefully-edited footage from various movies -- ""The Invincible Gladiator,"" ""The Stranger,"" ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Space Odyssey,"" ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble "" -- with comical dialogue added in (""I've seen in it the cards. You're thinking of becoming a ninja for Italian fascists!"").

But each episode also has a lot of original footage, which is partly based on the hilariously awful movie ""Ninja Terminator"" -- the English dialogue has all been dubbed in to make it sound odd, and there are some cute in-jokes woven in (the Garfield phone, the tiny robot).

And honestly, this stuff is even funnier than the redubbed movie footage -- it gets to be a lot more casual in its surreality. The dialogue is wonderfully silly (""I will stop you until you don't succeed!""), the budget is nonexistent (gore is represented by flying silk scarves), and there are all sorts of weird things that nobody really thinks about (Gordon's wife vanished years ago, leaving behind a self-videotaping project... which talks to Gordon from the TV set).

It also stars two fairly prominent internet critics, Brad Jones (also known as the Cinema Snob) and Ed Glaser (connoisseur of bad Turkish movies). Glaser is hilariously deadpan at all times, approaching the ridiculous plots with utmost ninja seriousness, and Jones joyously chews the scenery with a bug-eyed stare and an evil ninja laugh.

""Ninja the Mission Force: The Complete First Season"" is a ninja delight of ninja proportions -- half riffing, half absurdist ninja comedy. Once you've seen this, check out the second season online.

8546897,5,B00A6GCJHK,"Here's a group of people who clearly love what they do. I was already a big fan of Brad's and this is something in the vain of his Kung Tai Ted videos multiplied to the nth degree and it introduced me to ""Seriously"" Ed Glaser. If you've ever wanted to see a cheese ninja, ninjas go to space, or an interactive VCR wife, give this a watch. I mean, come on, John Travolta's in it. That's gotta mean something, right?",1354060800,,414,4.1875

8546899,5,B00A6GCJHK,"When talented Internet Personalities like Brad Jones(The Cinema Snob) & Ed Glasser(Dark Maze Studios)create something so unique and fun that can reach the limits of Amazon, then i'm asured that the future of entertainment is secured.

Creating  a mixture of Ninjas, Difertent Movie clips, Dinosaurs and Over the top fights, this Godfrey Ho love letter is an assured enterteinment piece, putting special apareances by: Charles Bronson, Enrest Borgnine, Brandon Lee, George Harrison, Orson Wells and many more in the style and likeness Godfrey Ho was loved for.

A must have for Cult and Genre films enthusiasts!.",1353283200,,611,5.34375
8546900,4,B00A6GCJHK,"Having been a fan of the Cinema Snob crew for some time, I was very much looking forward to this. I wasn't disappointed. Aside from the occasional lazy or flat joke, the humour zings with brilliance and wit. The writing and deadpan acting are tip-top, and the movie footage - woven in with the original scenes - really do add a lot of laughs. This one comes highly recommended.",1353283200,,377,4.478260869565218
8546901,5,B00A6GCJHK,"Filmmakers Ed Glaser of Dark Maze Studios and Brad Jones of thecinemasnob.com team up to deliver a comedy series the likes of which you probably haven't seen before.

The story follows Interpol agent and ninja Gordon on his quest to defeat Bruce of the Evil Ninja Empire.  (What's a ninja, you ask? Only a fairy tale.)  The Evil Ninja Empire is trying to gather all of the Avian Ninja Warriors in order to gain ultimate ninja power.

The style of production is an homage to cheesy kung fu filmmaking, specifically director Godfrey Ho.  Ho was famous for his tendency to cut cheaply-made new footage into old Hong Kong movies and re-dub the audio to create a new film for the American audience.  Glaser and Jones not only recreate Ho's editing style, but include such recognizable features as off-sync audio, grainy film, and cheap locations that resulted from the low budget Ho worked with.

For those in the know, they also include nods to specific films, for example when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Terminator/dp/B000ERVKI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Terminator</a>'s iconic telephone and robot messenger appear.  This isn't the kind of film that requires a PhD in ninjaspoitation cinema to enjoy, though, and is hysterical on its own merits.

The supporting cast is fantastic, especially Sarah Lewis and Jillian Zurawski, also from thecinemasnob.com, as Mrs. Gordon and Gordon's secretary respectfully.  Guest stars Brandon Lee, Ernest Borgnine, Richard Harrison, Orson Welles, John Travolta, Sonny Chiba, Charles Bronson, and others are used skillfully, hamming up the scenes without becoming grating.

Season two of Ninja the Mission Force is currently in production, so get season one!",1353283200,,1751,5.569811320754717
8546902,5,B00A6GCJHK,"There are few words that can describe the pure insanity that this series presents and it is glorious.  This is a tribute what love and creative can make.  If I had one complaint is that it was too short, but luckily season 2 is coming.  What other story will have ninjas fighting dinosaurs AND be this funny ON PURPOSE!

This show is a ninja salad with dinosaurs, space ships, zombies, and extra cheese ninjas.

This series will leave you with but one question: ""What's a Ninja?""",1353283200,,479,4.523255813953488
