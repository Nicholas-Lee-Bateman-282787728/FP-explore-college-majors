8393601,1,B003BHOYQA,"I get this set and neither DVD will play.  I get the first segment and they freeze up.  Both of them.  Contacted Amazon because I could not contact seller and no help.  I just hope I finally get the refund of the total amount.  And it is not my dvd player, brand new and every dvd I have works in it.  Really bad service here.................",1309305600,,342,4.184615384615385
8393602,5,B003BHOYQA,"First of all, I'm probably biased. I think Drive is the best low budget movie ever made. I've thought that since I first watched it. This DVD edition contains both this and Crying Freeman on two DVDs in one package. I was skeptical at first since the price was so low, but its a really great set. Drive is the uncut version. Strangely, the USA version was edited by quite a lot. This DVD is uncut, and the only way to see the film. Crying Freeman is a good movie, although a bit slow for me. Its almost surreal in its presentation, and that's what I like. This is the best quality version of this movie I've ever seen. Very nice 2.35:1 Anamorphic widescreen print. Also uncut. Highly recommended.",1294617600,2,696,4.403100775193798
