Mexico's Estudios Churubusco Azteca S.A. used to be Mexico's Hollywood. Marga Lopez, Hector Suarez, Carmen Montejo and Carmen Salinas all gave a great performance. Lopez' soft and fragile voice gives the film a classic touch. And Suarez' and Salinas' comic lines and scenes gives it the comedy. As for Montejo she will give the frighting parts.

An awesome film! I strongly recommend it. Also this is a very very hard film to find. It is strictly limited and rare. Televisa and AlterFilms distributed it for a while but didn't renew the rights, therefore the price is expensive and the film will be hard to find.",1229040000,,847,4.834482758620689
