7838264,4,6303114032,"This Cabin Fever Little Rascals tape features commentary by film historian Leonard Maltin. These tapes come from the original 35 mm prints and have been restored to excellent condition. The Cabin Fever tapes remain the most complete prints of the Our Gang films.

Helping Grandma is an adorable movie about the neighborhood kids ""working"" in an elderly woman's store. She is a kindhearted woman who often takes credit, so her business is in trouble. A chain-store has offered to buy the store, but she wants more money than what they have offered. Mr. Pennypacker, however, wants the offer, so he tries to con grandma out of her store and her money. The kids irriate him to distraction and all turns out well in the end. Some of the best scenes are between Wheezer, Stymie, Dorothy, and Shirley Jean. They do typical kid things but Stymie adds some great comedy to the mix.

Spanky is a vehicle for introducing Spanky, and the film contains part of his screen test. He's a mischievious little boy with a great laugh and plenty of personality. He goes bug hunting, and while the other kids put on their own production of Uncle Tom's Cabin, he proceeds to throw money all over the house and out of the window. Spanky was perhaps the only kid in the rascals who recieved such star treatment, and in later episodes, would be featured as ""introducing Spanky"" after the main titles. No other child recieved this honor, and Spanky is probably the best remembered rascal today.

Little Papa is a typical later short with the cast of Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat, and Porky. The kids want to play football, but Spanky must mind his little sister. The boys do all they can to tire her out so they can put her to bed, but she's bounding with energy. It all backfires in their faces with some great laughs along the way.

Two Too Young is the last short on this tape and it is the shortest. Alfalfa informs Spanky that Porky and Buckwheat have firecrackers, but they're much too young to set them off themselves. The two older kids try to convince the two younger kids at recess to give the firecrackers away, but with no luck. Finally, they're stolen away, but the young kids have the last laugh. Great fun!",1238630400,,2194,4.6179487179487175
