8338560,1,B001RPZE2Q,Boring. Slow. No chemistry. The highlight is the soundtrack. Don't waste your time. Don't pay for this drivel.,1465948800,,110,5.166666666666667
8338561,5,B001RPZE2Q,"This movie has an incredible atmosphere and the soundtrack is awesome. I really enjoyed how Wes wasn't constantly chasing after Allison like in every other romance/comedy. It's a great film, in my top five.",1416787200,2,206,5.088235294117647
8338562,3,B001RPZE2Q,"I'd say this movie was worth watching.

The female lead was not a likable character, made it difficult to see why Wes would have been attracted to her.  It was like she was always talking at him.  (Kind of like the person that posts all the great stuff that they do on FB, but you are well aware it's just for attention.)

Joey Kern's acting was really the main thing that held this film together I thought.  He really did a good job.
I do not understand the point of the 'dreams' OR the Christmas party though.  I watched to the end a little to see how it would turn out between the two, but mainly to find out what in the world the deal was with the dream and party.

If anyone has any insight on that, I'd love to know.",1371340800,,722,4.042253521126761
8338563,3,B001RPZE2Q,"I would love to see the prequel All the days after yesterday. I guess that doesn't leave much for time in between, especially for love.",1367020800,,135,4.44
8338564,2,B001RPZE2Q,"Kind of depressing....wouldn't recommend it, unless you want to feel better about a relationship that never got off the ground.",1357257600,2,127,5.4
8338565,2,B001RPZE2Q,"The personality of the female lead character was so self centered, shallow, and annoying, it was impossible to continue watching.  I turned it off after about 40 minutes.",1325894400,3,170,5.071428571428571
8338566,4,B001RPZE2Q,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was really soothing. I loved the part at the Grand Canyon, but don't understand when the Christmas Dinner party  happened. I loved the music. Does anyone know what songs played in this movie?",1299024000,2,223,4.717948717948718
