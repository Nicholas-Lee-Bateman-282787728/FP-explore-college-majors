2032656,5,B0001WANUY,"This is a great DVD that integrate  Vinyasa yoga and pilates very smoothly, you'll alternate from one to another without any break, a flow, just like a regular yoga o pilates practise but mixed. The pace is not too fast and Jonathan Urla is a good teatcher that doesn't talk all the time.
The music change with the exercices and is not distracting at all, the setting is nice and relaxing.
This DVD is not for beginner, you'll need a certain base in both discipline but it's relaxing and you'll built long and lean muscles.
Enjoy it.",1087862400,13,533,4.494845360824742
2032657,5,B0001WANUY,"I have had the pleasure of viewing all three of Jonathan Urla's Yogilates DVDs.  Levels 1 to 3 definitely correspond to the appropriate skill levels of the general public, in my opinion.  Of course, for the few very advanced practitioners of Hatha Yoga, the Vinyasa elements within the ""advanced"" Yogilates DVD might better approximate the beginnings of an intermediate program.  However, I think that for the majority of us, Level 3 Yogilates is as advanced as we'll probably endeavor to strive for.  In any event, for those die-hard practitioners, the instructions are generously peppered with tips for increasing the difficulty of various poses.

That said, I find the complementary Yoga/Pilates exercises to be quite rigorous yet synergistic.  In fact, I have yet to experience a ""day after"" without feeling some kind of ache ... and this is a good thing!  I know I'm working my body in ways it has not been accustomed to (and I engage in advanced pilates matwork several times a week!).  More importantly, I always walk away with a sense of gain and accomplishment.  To drive the point home, there are a couple of instances where even one of the demonstrators fumbles a bit -- and she appears to be quite fit, strong and flexible!

As for aesthetics, the setting is soothing and the Indian music blends quite nicely.  Jonathan's tone is relaxing and confident, with some light humor thrown in.  My favorite line (which may actually be intended sincerely) is when he makes reference to a particular pose, saying that it should elicit a feeling of happiness -- I'll say, tongue-in-cheek, that I was distinctly not happy.

For Pilates enthusiasts who want to include wonderful stretches within their techniques, and for Hatha yogins who want to supplement their practice with terrific strength building exercises, this is the fusion you're looking for!  The Yogilates DVDs are a great choice!",1083715200,20,1894,5.0095846645367414

2032679,4,B0001WANUY,"I've been doing yoga and pilates consistently (dvds at home) for only about 3 weeks and this was relatively easy for me. I think that's a testament to the effectiveness of a regular practice, but also to say this one seems more intermediate than advanced, but still a nice practice.

I wasn't too sure about the vinyasa flow at the end of the video, seemed like that should be first after warmup. It was a little choppy and slow moving in some ways and I feel like I could've worked a little harder in a shorter time, but I still felt good after doing it. Granted this dvd is several years old and it seems like the trend these days in yoga, pilates or yoga/pilates fusion workouts is more work/less time. Its good, but I have several that are better, for me.",1395014400,2,759,4.345070422535211
2032680,5,B0001WANUY,"I started with the Beginning Yogilates, moved on to Intermediate after about a month & now, 6 months later, I'm working on the Advanced level. I really like Jonathan Urla's straight forward style and I have become stronger since I started. There is a much larger jump in difficulty between the Intermediate to the Advanced than from Beginning to Intermediate. The Intermediate was becoming too easy but there are a quite a few exercises in the Advanced that I simply can't do.  I like the challenge, but I wish he would offer a way to alter some of the really difficult poses while I am building strength and balance. I get a little more successful each time and it is good to have something to work toward so I still recommend it.",1391644800,,731,4.537878787878788
2032681,4,B0001WANUY,"Maybe its just because its been years since I've even touched or handled a VHS tape, but it does take some getting used to the grainy picture that seems to shudder and flicker for no reason.
Aside from that, this workout is hands down (downward dog pun here) by far the best I've used.
I am a regular bodybuilder, but not even an intense gym session compares to how challenging this video can be.. Now thats if you put into it what you want to get out of it.. I've seen some people half@ssing their way through, but any idiot can do that.
Also works great as an adjunct to a weightlifting routine. The increased flexibility that you gain from doing these yogilates tapes provides a significant boost to your weight room session, with the added benefit of decreasing your odds of getting an injury in the gym.",1389052800,,808,4.466216216216216

2032683,5,B0001WANUY,"I already own Yogilates 1 + 2, but they were getting too easy for me, I didn't get the feeling anymore that I was doing a workout. I'm happy that I bought Yogilates 3, because it's quite a challenging workout! I'm doing Power Yoga everyweek at a yoga studio... but after doing Yogilates 3, I still got muscle pain in my belly and my hamstrings!!! The sound isn't as good as on Yogilates 1 + 2, but it's good enough to follow.

I also like Jonatha Urla very much. I hope someday he will make Yogilates 4!",1368748800,,503,4.185567010309279
2032684,3,B0001WANUY,"After buying a few exercise videos, I was disappointed in the quality of video and sound.  The production quality is the worse I have seen.  The routine itself was very good and feel amazing after completing the session.",1367712000,,220,4.7631578947368425
2032685,5,B0001WANUY,I loved the 1st and second video because he wasn't too winded and did not linger in certain poses forever. The first one is a great beginner video if you've never tried Yoga. This one was challending and makes you feel like you've accomplished something in the end.,1363651200,,265,4.541666666666667

2032687,5,B0001WANUY,"Excellent. I Love this DVD. Part 2 is my favorite. Only problem is that the filming of the DVD is very ""grainy"" and not professionally filmed.

2032708,5,B0001WANUY,"The instructor who hosts the video, Jonathon Urla, is by far one of the best instructors I've ever seen on a workout video. And, Yogilates is a phenomenal way to get your yoga, stretches, & Pilates done all at once. I always feel like I've done a serious workout after, while also feeling relaxed & renewed. I highly recommend it!",1354924800,2,330,4.516666666666667
2032709,4,B0001WANUY,"I now have all three of the Yogalates workout led by Jonathan Urla.
I did the beginning level for a few weeks till I got the moves and postures and
how the practice flowed. then I moved up to the intermediate level which was considerably more demanding
It is now my morning yoga practice almost every day. It stretches every muscle in my body, and asks the
student for more flexibility and balance. Jonathan's instructions are clear and easy to follow. His reminders
while holding a posture keep me breathing while encouraging me to use my core muscles.
The third in the series, Advanced Yoglates, is very demanding. Moving more rapidly between poses
and and asking the student to attempt poses that ask for more strength and balance.
I do this workout when I have a little more time, and feel strong and ready for it.
I'm very happy with the whole series and would recommend to any living room exerciser",1348185600,4,904,4.62111801242236
2032710,5,B0001WANUY,A very effective workout of yoga and pilates. It works all parts of your body and when you are finished it makes you feel motivated and full of energy.,1333411200,,151,4.241379310344827
2032711,4,B0001WANUY,"This is a great full body workout. Jonathan mixes Pilates & Yoga quite well.  It flows very nicely.  You start out setting on the floor and build from there. It is in 3 sections giving you the option of pausing and coming back later or going on.  The only reason I give this a 4star instead of a 5 star rating is the audio.  Sometimes I can't hear the instructions because he is: 1.maybe out of breath or 2. maybe he's whispering or 3. he forgets to give instruction. He also wears a headset and sometimes has his chin down to his chest so he can't talk loud enough.  The first dvd I had to send back to the company; couldn't hardly hear any of it. They promptly sent me another one; this dvd is better but they still need to fix some of the audio.  He also forgets which leg to move.  Sometimes the first set is: move the right leg forward, do the asana; then you should repeat with the other side, but he'll say again: move the right leg forward..if you don't keep up with which side you're doing, you'll repeat the same side, neglecting the other.  I've used this video enough tho, to realize that he's giving the ""wrong side"" instruction so I make the proper adjustments.  Even with a couple of areas of which could be improved, I still love this video and work out with it at least every other day; and it does make you sweat and leaves you with a ""good sore."" I'm getting stronger, leaner with this workout; it really does a body good!!!",1271462400,3,1443,4.256410256410256
2032712,5,B0001WANUY,"I've been practicing yoga for nearly 3 years, and it is my exercise of choice.  But I needed to have Pilates again in my life--with my lack of time, I would settle for Pilates-infused yoga.  I've already done Yogilates 2 a few times (which I also own); it quickly became a little mild, and I needed a challenge.  So I just purchased this DVD from Amazon and did it in its entirety.  Its setting is inspiring and luxe.  Really is gorgeous.

But not to be lulled by the spa-like background with the potted palms, statuary, natural stone tiles, and lit pillar candles ... This workout really kicked my butt.  And I could tell right away that it would be effective for weight control and toning my midsection.  My entire midsection.  As in can't-cough-without-it-hurting sore - for 2 days.  This DVD delivers these kinds of results.  It would take me a while to work up to the level of difficulty of this program.  Jonathan Urla has a healing, relaxed, easygoing manner-it isn't forced, and he is fully engaged in teaching-and that is also what inspires me.",1267574400,3,1053,4.632432432432433
2032713,4,B0001WANUY,"This is the 3rd & most advanced in the Yogilates series. Jonathan Urla is relaxing as always, but challenges you & kick your butt in this workout. It's over 70 min. of work with a short guided meditation at the end.
The only thing I didn't care for was some of the music, it seemed too elevator style for me, but I loved the choice for the meditation best. (I tend to like Enigma style for relaxing.)
There are way too many poses/exercises to list (all thee popular ones of both styles) & many poses flowed with each other & Jonathan has good body awareness.

The exercises are challenging, but doable; Jonathan Urla is charming and has a sense of humor; his models are beautiful and motivating. This workout is outstanding and could be compared to Brian Kest's Power Yoga (not boring, variety of exercises, challenge and results). I highly recommend it for intermediate and advanced students.

2032716,5,B0001WANUY,"If you already have been working with Yogilates 2 for awhile or have experience with yoga and pilates, this DVD is a defnite must-have. While recovering from pregnancy, I started doing Louise Solomon's Yogalates series...I found this to be a great introduction to yoga and pilates, but after a year of doing her advanced tape I needed something more challenging. So I worked with Yogilates 2 for almost a year as well and LOVED it....it was relaxing, fun, and gave appropriate challenge. Well, after awhile, I felt like the Yogilates 2 was no longer doing much for me, so I had to move up to #3. I am finding it to be quite a big step up from the second (as demonstrated by the fact that his second DVD has a room full of students and this one only two, and one of these is intermediate/advanced rather than advanced. It is long and very challenging and I haven't yet made it through the entire thing after working with it for a couple weeks pretty intensely, but I feel that the confidence I gained from his 2nd DVD has been very motivating for me, and it is great to know that this one will give me something to work with for awhile.

That said, if you have experience with yoga but not pilates or the other way around, you might want to start with his second DVD. This one is very challenging but definitely doable for the advanced practitioner.",1184112000,8,1348,4.435483870967742

I have always heard that how good yoga is for our mind and body, yet I found it was not intense enough. Then yogilates comes in! I just practiced Jonathon Urla's Yogilate Level 3 (DVD) this morning, I felled in love right away! The 80 min long practice is well combined the dynamic core training of pilates with the static balance poses of yoga. Jonathan's guide is very clear and accurate yet not make you feel too much of him talking. There are a few poses in the workout that I was not able to do, so that gives something to improve every time I practice. To sum it all, I definitely give a thumb up for Jonathan Urla and this workout video.

8016873,1,B0001WANUY,"I literally stopped the DVD halfway through so I could write this review. I would be a little less harsh if it was a beginning level, but it's level 3 advanced. Not once did I break a sweat. The DVD is 80 minutes and feels like a complete waste of time. Do you know how much yoga and Pilates I could fit into 80 minutes?! Instead, I followed this joke of a workout and actually got chilly on a summer day because it's so easy. It feel like something seniors could do. I'm not putting down seniors, I am just expressing that if you are going to call something level 3, live up to the level. Plus, the production  isn't very good. The instructor is often hard to hear as he does the movement because the mic is getting blocked by the position of his body. Save your money.
