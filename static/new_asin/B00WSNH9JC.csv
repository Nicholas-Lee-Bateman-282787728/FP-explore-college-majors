7153616,1,B00WSNH9JC,"The five people you do NOT want to get stuck with during a crisis. I realize in a lot of movies, the actresses are chosen for their looks. But do you think you could have found one with at least a couple of live brain cells? The men weren't any better. Plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon, completely disjointed. Just not worth the time. Honestly, the only reason I finished watching it was because I was hoping to watch them all slow, horrible deaths. Today was just not my day.",1469059200,2,483,4.260869565217392

8714104,1,B00WSNH9JC,"Terrible Film. Nothing in this work. The story is predictable, the characters uninteresting and the horror doesn't even work for most if not all the film. This whole thing is so poorly directed that most of the time I was just checking my phone waiting for it to end as nothing in it is interesting.

The performances are not the worst thing in the world but are not good neither. However, it's impossible to take any of this seriously when every single element in the film is so clich than you have seen it like in other 3000 films before, not to mention the production value (I know this film was made with very little budget, but please, most of the time it looks like a youtube video as the editing is lame, the cinematography is really poor and just a couple of decent VFX seems to justify the status of this Z-series product",1499731200,,830,4.3896103896103895
8714105,1,B00WSNH9JC,"Drags on and on and on.  The camera wobbles and shakes the first and last 20 minutes of the movie.  Not good if you get dizzy easily. The group never questions why the power/lights don't work, though all the surveillance cameras in the rooms do. What do children have to do with anything?  Why the screaming and fighting?  To make up for lack of plot and dialogue I imagine. This movie is not scary,  does not make sense and is a waste of time.",1473984000,2,444,4.238095238095238
8714106,1,B00WSNH9JC,"Less a horror film then an endurance test checking how long you can stand to see 5 young people getting drunk and babbling, waiting for the 10 minutes or so of horror flick tucked away at the end.",1473552000,,196,4.184210526315789
8714107,1,B00WSNH9JC,"BORRRRRRINGGGGG...

Wanna know what happens? Nothing creepy, that's for sure. Instead, you get to watch a bunch of obnoxious college kids improvise their dialogue while drinking and having fun. Oh, and then, at the very end, some stuff kinda happens that I assume the filmmakers thought was scary to them?",1473465600,,305,5.1
8714108,2,B00WSNH9JC,"Five young adults spend Halloween in an empty Hostel ""west of Ireland."" There is no electricity except there is power to the installed cameras, go figure. They drink, smoke, start a fire and play ""ask the glass"" a home made Ouija board. They managed to invoke (Conjuring has already been taken) a spirit (Paula Phelan) that wants ""my children."" Oh yes, this is a murder house too. At 53 minutes things begin to happen, no one believes the man who first filmed the ghost and apparently he had a camera you can't rewind and look at what you just shot.

The film degrades into the classic run cam, floor cam, shoe cam, whine and snivel cam, scream in the dark cam, and girl dragged across the floor cam...been there done that and better. One of the characters mentions the film ""Visions of Darkness"" known for using paradoxical backgrounds. Normally clues like this are mentioned and then tie into the film in such a way to demonstrate creative genius of the script writer/director. I didn't notice that in this film where seeing landscapes was severely limited by the hand held genre.
