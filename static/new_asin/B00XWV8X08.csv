7202509,5,B00XWV8X08,I love this movie. Something i can watch over and over with my family. Great movie kind of a bible spin off from the animals point of view. Wish it had one title only.,1449964800,,167,3.9411764705882355

7202511,5,B00XWV8X08,"What a great and awe-inspiring film. I must say that those who find this movie extra-biblical are simply breaking the message of God's unifying vision into semantics for the purpose of Satan. My one-year-old loved the film and had plenty to say about Amy Grant's character. The animation was wonderfully-done and it's a movie, truly, for the whole family. God bless you all and may our conscious choices to outcast Satan's media monopoly bring our children closer to the Lord.",1443571200,,476,4.9625
7202512,3,B00XWV8X08,"This movie is available on various streaming sites (including Amazon's) under a different title - ""All Creatures Big & Small."" Which means, you can rent it, ""try before you buy.""

Either title is a bit of an odd choice because they (along with being a ""Dove Certified"" movie, and being a movie about Noah's Ark and the Great Flood) would lead you to believe it's a movie steeped in religious messaging, and nothing could be further from the truth. The Great Flood is nothing more than a plot device to separate children from parents; there are no humans at all in the movie, not even Noah, he uses animal emissaries to assemble all the lucky creatures who get a free ride and even steer the boat. And some of the animals - including the leads - do not exist today (are they extinct? Or - spoiler alert? - DO THEY EVOLVE?!?! DUH DUH DUUUUUHHHHH!)

The movie plays like low-rent Disney, complete with separation anxiety, plucky kids that can do it I just KNOW it, antagonists that go back and forth between genuine threat and comic relief, kids saving parents who go on to save kids who go on to save parents... My kids liked it and asked to see it again. Don't know if it'll be a regular thing; I suspect it'll be disposable. We were given the title free to stream, so no loss. It's harmless, inoffensive from a moral standpoint. I'm not overtly religious so this was no great loss for me, but if you're looking for something overtly religious, with an original story dovetailing with an accurate-from-a-Biblical-standpoint about the story of the Ark, this is not it.",1441065600,11,1566,4.589285714285714
7202513,4,B00XWV8X08,"I was expecting a ""Christian"" movie. But there is absolutely no mention of God which was very disappointing.  However, this is a very cute movie. Good clean family watching. My kiddos loved it!",1440892800,7,193,4.848484848484849

7202517,5,B00XWV8X08,"This was a ""if you like .... you may like...."" recommendation. They were SO right! I LOVE it! I don't know why I'd never heard of it before! It is (loosely) the story of Noah's Ark, but that's as religious as it gets....NOT at all (in fact, evolution plays a big part). SO fun!",1480982400,,277,4.148148148148148
7202518,4,B00XWV8X08,"This was a cute film with a twist to the story of Noah's Ark. Some seriously funny parts kept my husband entertained. The ending is pretty awesome! The characters are ones you get to like and care about (yes, even as they are animated characters). Easy, family movie.",1471824000,,267,4.583333333333333
7202519,5,B00XWV8X08,"I bought this movie for my 2 yr. old grandson.  We watch it together, and we both love it.  I believe it would also keep children up to 8- 10 years old interested.",1470441600,,163,3.909090909090909
7202520,5,B00XWV8X08,My children LOVE this Movie. It appears to have many different names but it doesn't matter this is a good wholesome family movie. Being a Christian family this is a nice spin on the story of Noah and the Ark from the animals perspective! It's super cute and not highly religious at all! I highly recommend this movie to anyone with little one! It is very entertaining!,1468800000,,368,4.507462686567164
7202521,4,B00XWV8X08,"In the event that you never heard of All Creatures Big and Small; theres a good possibility thats because this film goes by a lot of different names.  Sometimes it depends on where you happen to be in the world.  Other times even that doesnt seem to matter.  Its also known as Ooops! Noah is Gone, other times its titled Two by Two, and even at times Ooops the Ark has Gone.  Regardless of what the cover says, all these titles lead back to the 2015 German-Belgian-Luxembourg-Irish 3D computer-animated adventure that takes the classic Biblical tale of Noahs Ark and tells it with a comedic twist from the perspective of the animals involved.

In theme and delivery, the piece feels a bit like the Ice Age series from Blue Sky- with the antics of small fuzzy animals playing against the contrast of larger more underlying themes of doom and extinction.  However, while the Ice Ages seem to rely heavily upon slapstick and visual humor, All Creatures Big and Small contains a surprising deal of layered humor.  Kids will laugh at the visual gags, complete with cuddly main characters and some beautifully done action sequences but adults tuning in may find a bit to enjoy as well; especially by the end when the film manages to tie up some potential loose ends brilliantly.

The story centers on a pair of nestrians, a partially fictitious species of animal (rumored to have been inspired by a very real rare aquatic sea slug called Glaucus Atlanticus) who are summoned to report to a meeting concerning all the animals of the world.  There they receive word that am impending flood approaches and only those animals selected for passage upon the ark stand a chance for salvation.  It should be noted that not unlike staple entries to the genre from Pixar A Bugs Life and Cars, not a single human makes an appearance in this film.  Noah, in fact, is referenced only by name.

Discovering that they are not on the invite-only list for Ark passage, father nestrian Dave disguises he and son Finny to look like grymps; small solitary cat-like creatures that do indeed make the grade for board-age.  Should be a simple cruise until the floodwaters retreat except for one minor snag:  young nestrian, Finny, and the young grymp, Leah, soon find themselves outside the Arks deck when the flood arrives.  From here the film focuses on Finny and Leahs attempts to survive the rising waters in hopes that the Ark will come back for them while their parents do everything they can to convince the ships animal crew to turn the vessel around for their children.

The visuals and animation cycles here are fantastic with a nice vivid color pallet, crisp editing and character models that manage to look remarkably similar to the real-life animals they are replicating without ever losing the cartoony base.  Critics the world over seem to find fault with the look of the film but its clear many of them have never worked in animation or the CG medium.  Textures of fur and plant, water and droplets are all first-rate here from the first frame to the last.  Lighting too is spot on- and some of the luminescence effects under water give up nothing to Pixars much celebrated firefly effect from The Good Dinosaur.

Pacing too is excellent with neither scenes that drag on unnecessarily long nor moments that feel as if they were added as filler to hit the correct run-time.  Rather, every single sequence in the film comes off as a catalyst to advance the story.

Voice acting is also delightful- many of the jokes work off the dynamic of character interaction and the cast of actors here show seasoning and excellent timing as almost all of the humor contained within hits its mark.

Its not entirely clear to me why the film manages to receive as many poor reviews from critics as it does.  Regardless of whether viewing it for its technical merit, narrative, originality or entertainment value, the piece does a lot of things right.

The core themes of friendship sprouting up from unlikely duos, the awe-demanding power of nature, and even the absolutely brilliant reason not all animals were selected to board proves that no part of the screenplay was left to chance.

This is one of those rare moments where my best advice would be to ignore the critics, skeptics haters and naysayers and give this one a chance.  Just remember you may have to do a little research first to find out what its called in your area.",1468454400,,4404,4.715404699738904

7202524,4,B00XWV8X08,"I'll buy movies like this any day for my kids.  We watched it this past year and my kids liked it 8, 6, 2 and even my husband and I enjoyed it.  It's a good clean family movie!",1465171200,,176,3.6052631578947367
7202525,4,B00XWV8X08,"Wow, some movies you immediately know who is voicing the critters and it detracts from (or adds to) the enjoyment of the movie. This was not one of those movies. I didn't notice Sheen or any of the voice actors standing out particularly.

My kids (boy, girl aged 7 and 8) and I enjoyed this movie. Honestly I was surprised we liked it as much as we did. Very little to no religious angles. Noah is just ""a generous guy"" who is providing the ark and the Lion (Sheen, I assume?) is mostly in charge. We never see Noah or any humans except in the most minimal ways possible, the Lion is even driving the ark.

The story started off stressful and my daughter was worried the two young critters would be lost forever when they miss the ark in the first moments of the movie. (No real spoiler there folks). I assured her that the good guys always win (and hoped it was true in this case) and we watched on...

There is a good bit of Deus Ex Machina here and the movie abuses a fairly silly device to explain why the Nestrians weren't originally allowed on the ark in the first place, but if you set aside critical thinking for a moment and just enjoy the movie, it is a reasonably humorous ending and twist.  It has a good moral tale in that the Grymps (Grumps?) like to go it alone while the Nestrians like to do things as a team. The team concept, of course, ends up triumphing and it really is a cute story.

If you are militantly atheist or agnostic I believe you could let your kids watch this and not be offended. As I mentioned, there is almost no Bible in the story. Ultimately, that is maybe a good thing because even Christians often disagree over details and this way there isn't anything to argue about really, it is just a fun story.

I will add that I am somewhat confused about this title and another one called All Creatures Great and Small. I THINK it is the same movie, with the original European voices and this is a hijacked version of that title with Amy Grant and Martin Sheen voicing it over to increase the likelihood of financial success. But I haven't had a chance to confirm that yet. I'm not sure how the two would compare, but my curiousity is piqued now.  If I find the other, I'll try to come back and add a comparison.

One other note, I do not like movies to shove politics down my kids throats. I detest that and no matter WHICH side it comes from, it irritates me. This movie does not do that... I saw no global warming or other politics in the movie. The flood wasn't cause by man made climate change. It just showed a story of a couple of ""kids"" in a precarious situation (missed the ark) trying to get back to their parents (and their parents efforts to get back to their kids) without trying to indoctrinate my kids into someone else's worldview, other than the whole ""teamwork can be better than going it alone"" message.

I do reserve 5 stars for movies like Toy Story and Avatar, so for me 4 stars is 8/10 and still a very good rating.",1463443200,2,2970,4.270462633451957

7202530,5,B00XWV8X08,"This would be a better plot.

""Two by Two: God's Little Creatures"" is the wacky tale of three furry friends, Gil, Ga, and Mesh and their struggle to keep their heads above water. Hilarity ensues as the three companions are forced to leave their homeland in search of refuge from the menacing villain, Yahweh. Yahweh, the once merciful and loving creator of everything, becomes violently jealous when he looks down to learn that the world would rather embrace his gift of free will than exalt him. Will Yahweh be able to regulate his emotions, or will he unleash total destruction upon the Earth? Time is running out.

Join the tenacious trio as they embark on a fun-filled journey to stay afloat in this comical, yet heartwarming, film. Watch shenanigans unfold as they meet new friends along the way like Joey, the swimming kangaroo and Woody, the vegetarian termite. One ark. 50,000 animals.

Our son was very familiar with the story of Noah's ark and had no problem relating the movie to the biblical account of Noah's ark, children who are not familiar with the biblical account of Noah's ark are still able to benefit from this movie for it will spark a conversation on the biblical account and the movie really does help kids relate to exactly what happened during the Great Flood.
