8458142,4,B0055DXR7U,"Andy James has Synyster Gates' style down pat. His instructional DVD is great for those who want to learn some of the licks in Gates' toolbox. James' performance is clean and flawless, and he provides bite-sized lessons for each section. The DVD won't teach you how to improvise, but if you want to learn and play James' performance note-for-note, it is worth the purchase.",1370995200,,373,4.84375
