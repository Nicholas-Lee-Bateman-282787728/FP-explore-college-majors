6577778,5,B00MH9NEQY,"I received the DVD 1 day early. Thoughtful, well produced and great audio and video quality. Well done EC, I really enjoyed listening to some favorites done just right. These songs never grow old.",1415059200,2,196,4.794117647058823
6577779,4,B00MH9NEQY,"As he approached his 70th birthday and - for the first time in his career - was considering ending world tours, Eric Clapton scheduled a tour of seven performances in four cities in Japan, Malaysia, Dubai and Bahrain in February 2014. His concert in Japan would be his 200th concert  there in 40 years! Filmmaker David Maxwell and his crew went along for the tour and the result is this 2 hour, 36 minute documentary/concert film.

We get to see Clapton and his band - with Steve Gadd on drums and Nathan East on bass - perform 13 songs (and we hear a 14th song over the end credits) which are intercut with a segments from a lengthy ono-on-one iterview that Maxwell had with Clapton throughout the tour. There isn't much discussion of Clapton's career or his family life; it revolves around his connection with Japan and the Japanese impresario - ""Mr. Udo"" (firsr name never mentioned) - who has booked him for 40 years. Clapton also discusses his thoughts on aging -  though he never says that this will be his last tour to the Far East.

The HD photography is great on the Blu-ray with some really nice close-ups - though there are some moments during the first two performances where Maxwell includes shots taken from far away with what appears to be a shaky hand-held camera. (But these only happen at the beginning).

Of course Clapton plays his hits - the ones you've heard many times over - ""Layla"", ""I Shot the Sheriff"", ""Tears In Heaven"" and ""Crossroads"" are here. Longtime fans will notice the nuances but for the rest, it's just another well-filmed concert performance.

The interview questions (both Gadd and East are interviewed too) sometimes become repetitive and I, for one, would have liked Maxwell to have edited the ""film"" a bit more (and put some of the footage as bonus clips). This is a long film.  Hence my rating at 4 stars - ""I liked it""

There are bonuses on the DVD:Two very short narrative pieces and two music performances. The bonuses total 10 minutes.

The BD package includes an eight-page bookley with small photos and a four-page essay by Jeff Jass.

This is a DVD that Clapton fans will want to see and Eagle Rock has priced it reasonably. The disc is ""indexed"" so you can jump to the music selections.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6577789,1,B00MH9NEQY,"The god of the guitar is gone. The concert was horrible. I know everyone loves Eric, and for many good reasons. However when you can no longer play even your old songs any more it is time to hang it up.
He said Japan had the best fans in the world and that it was his favorite people to play for. Perhaps it would be a good place for him to retire to. There comes a time when we all have to stop doing what we have always done..no matter how much we love it.
It is still great to listen to my old Clapton recordings but I don't want to see him perform live ever again.",1448928000,,568,3.8632478632478633

The performances were excellent and I didn't mind the interspersed interviews (as some other reviewers here have taken issue with) - I felt they made the presentation more interesting. I do wish EC would throw in another track or two from 461 Ocean Blvd (in addition to ""I Shot The Sheriff"")  but otherwise this is pretty solid profile of EC in his late period career.",1445558400,,442,4.582278481012659

He still has the tools but he plays with lesser musicians who simply follow his orders but don't inspire him in new musical directions. Too bad because when he's on - he's the greatest guitarist I've ever heard.",1420243200,,453,4.136363636363637

6577845,5,B00MH9NEQY,"Having been Eric Clapton's fan all my life, I never got to watch him live. This video is about as close as I can get to know more about recent events and his tours to the far east. I believe its an important milestone in his life in particular his regular visits to Japan where not many solo artist can actually performed 200 shows at a single venue, The Budokan, Tokyo. Amazing isn't it?
But what impressed me is his sincerity and humility that he has with his travelling band of musicians and back up singers and the greatest respect they have for him makes you wanna watch this video over and over again.
As he approached the next golden age when he turn 70 next year (2015), we may not see him touring like he is doing it now. Grab this video now when you can still enjoy his music. The ""slowhand"" is still nimble and as I watch his fingers running up and down his guitar fret, I just cant help but be mesmerised at the marvel of a musican that is uncomparable to any.",1419811200,,972,4.2032085561497325

6577853,4,B00MH9NEQY,"Although this a very good documentary on what may be Clapton's last tour of Japan or touring in general, what is the drawback is the way it is presented. Interviews interspersed with full on performance's of his concert are fine since none of the songs are cut, but if one desires to watch the concert again (and again) one must fast forward through the interviews to get to the next song.
 Interviews are fine with all band members and Eric himself, but to sit through that portion over and over again instead of being able to watch the concert in it's entire sequence makes it a drag to enjoy. Interviews could have been interspersed here and there and featured  as bonus section ala the Cream reunion concert and Clapton/Winwood concert at MSG.
 Thus my rating of 4 stars. Other may disagree but then again everyone is entitled to their own opinion.",1419120000,,852,4.629139072847682

6577863,4,B00MH9NEQY,"I'm not usually a fan of these hybrid music documentaries.  Not because I dislike docs, but because the music is usually short-changed.  Happily this isn't the case with this production.  Clapton has more than hinted that he might retire from touring when he hits 70 in March, 2015.  So this could be his last tour, although he continually hedges his bets in the various interview segments.  This tour includes stops in Japan, Singapore, Dubai and Bahrain.

Accompanied by 6 musicians and a supporting contingent, the film goes back and forth between interviews with Clapton, bandmates or country-based contributors and live concert footage. In future viewings it should be easy enough to skip over the interviews. Unlike many similar films, we get full songs uncut and in a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.0 soundtrack.  I don't know why we don't get a .1 LFE track but alas, we don't.

Like many music concerts this Blu ray has a 1080i resolution, but comes in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The interviews in particular, look very good.  Chrystal clear.  During some of the concert footage, there is a huge drop off in visual quality.  Hey, it's about the music anyway.  The audio, in spite of the lack of dedicated low frequency channel has plenty of pop.  Bonus feature include a few more songs cut from the film.  Here is the track list with a heavy emphasis on familiar songs:
1. Tell the Truth
2. Pretending
3. Crossroads
4. Driftin' Blues
5. I Shot the Sheriff
6. Little Queen of Spades
7. Layla
8. Wonderful Tonight

11. Tears in Heaven

6577873,1,B00MH9NEQY,"I'm listening to Eric since 1969, and I was very disappointed by this DVD (ever since it was announced, in fact). We don't want just another live DVD/CD with yet another performance of the same old songs; what we want is a Crossroads 3, with rare live performances from about 1985 till now (for example Got My Mojo Working in Basel in 2013, Love Her With A Feeling in Cardiff in 2005, South Bank Show with Buddy Guy in 1987, etc).",1417132800,4,430,4.320987654320987
6577874,5,B00MH9NEQY,I enjoyed this video concert/documentary. One key element here is that Clapton is the sole guitar player in the band and you get to hear him carrying all the guitar work.

6577880,3,B00MH9NEQY,"It actually pains me to say this, because I am a huge Eric Clapton fan, but everyone should avoid buying his new blu ray.

PLANES, TRAINS, AND ERIC fails miserably on two levels.

First, the 5.1 sound mix is awful! This is an Eric Clapton blu ray but the bass is so overwhelming in the 5.1 surround sound mix that you can barely hear the guitar, which Eric Clapton is playing! Whoever did this mix should never be allowed to mix anything ever again because they are very obviously deaf.

Second, you don't have the option of watching the concert without interruption. Each song is interspersed with interview segments and it doesn't give the option to watch the concert without them. This is a feature that has been available since the 1990s, but has not been available on any of Clapton's DVDs/blu rays yet? It's time to get a new digital author, or at least make the guy Clapton uses take some classes to update his programing skills.",1415404800,2,936,4.559523809523809
6577881,2,B00MH9NEQY,"You can find better performances of Eric Clapton's live concerts on YouTube, particularly from the early to mid 90's. The performances on this disc are fairly lackluster and not terribly engaging. In fact, I thought the other band musicians were more memorable than Eric. And the balance of the video is just filler, with the same quotes you've heard and read many times before. Overall, a pretty dull affair.",1415404800,2,409,4.942028985507246
6577882,1,B00MH9NEQY,"Audio is horrendous at best; anyone else experiencing this?

also not a fan of breaking up the concert after each song...they should have done the documentary at the end or another part....

one of the worst blurays have bought!",1415318400,5,228,4.82051282051282
6577883,4,B00MH9NEQY,Eric still has it what great music with Steve Gad on drums and Nathan East on Bass However I thought sound quality was not the greatest I have other Eagle products but this one seemed like a amateur recorded it the interviews are a bit long I would like more music,1415318400,,264,4.196078431372549
6577884,5,B00MH9NEQY,"I've only been a Clapton fan for the better part of 13 years and being only 26 years old I can't say I've seen him in his so called ""prime"" which many say was during his time with Cream, but there is so much more to him than that. I have seen Clapton a total of 7 times live and listened to everything he came out with including material never released and every time he is amazing. Some people say he goes through the motions and lets his backup signers do the work. Hell, if I ever live that long AND did what he has been doing for ""FIFTY YEARS"" I would need some help as well. People expect way too much no matter what it is in life. This is a shame. Watch his performance of ""Sheriff"" and ""Queen of Spades"" or the whole damn thing and you can see the fire is still there. He is a very gracious musician by even sharing his time with us fans even though he might think of us as a distraction or nuisance as he says in the movie. He loves what he does and this DVD/Blu Ray shows that he is still touring and wouldn't have what he does today without us fans. Don't get me wrong I love his past work so much. ""Just One Night"" is awesome as well as ""Slowhand"" and ""461"" which are just a few solo albums I love, and Cream is without a doubt the best band ever. But this is Clapton NOW, he is our current Clapton no matter how much you might say otherwise. For those people living in the past whom have already brushed him off; I feel sorry for you. Every time you see him in this video he plays most of his hits which is what most people see him for. There will come a time when he can't play guitar anymore like BB King and just talk the whole time (Watch Him Nowadays), but trust me he knows when his time is up and that time is not now and lets enjoy him while he still can play better than most of the guitar greats still with us from that era. Watch this film and you will know what I mean. CLAPTON IS GOD!!!",1415232000,24,1911,3.9533678756476682
6577885,2,B00MH9NEQY,"As a life long Clapton fan I have to say Mr. Clapton should do exactly what he is hinting to do in this work and that is retire from the stage. He deserves it and I do not want to see him do what to many of his contemporaries have done and that is hang on too long.

The video is excellent and so is the sound but Clapton is not really engaged in his performance and it shows. He has very little interest in singing and as another review noted he lets his back up gals take on more of the work. His playing lacks dynamics we have enjoyed for years.

While I do not want to give up the content of this DVD Clapton comments that he finds the audience more of a distraction then an asset to the live shows these days.

I have been blessed to see Clapton many times live and the One More Car One More Rider tour and DVD was one of the best if not the best shows I have ever seen. This work shows Clapton in a retirement playing out the string mode which is sad.

Thanks for the memories Eric I will just put this work on the shelf and choose to gravitate towards the Clapton of yesteryear.",1415232000,6,1085,3.963302752293578

6577887,5,B00MH9NEQY,A great documentary of Eric Clapton as he contemplates when and how to retire.. It interviews him and his band members Nathan East and Steve Gadd  Its amazing he has been around for so long and has been able to do it on his own terms  Lets hope he stays active at least to a certain extend.. I really don't think you can do it over 50 years and walk away.  I am sure he will record and perform and just don't think it will be on the grand scale he has always done.. The music is excellant and the songs he sings are hits  I do with maybe he could have done some of his more current songs as well,1415232000,,595,3.8925619834710745
6577888,5,B00MH9NEQY,"I just received and finished watching my EC DVD. I didn`t have high expectations, reading the set list beforehand, and reading a reviewer previously, who thought Eric was going thru the motions, I was prepared for a ho-hum, dry film. I can say that I was very pleasantly surprised, and really enjoyed this one. I have been a fan for over 40 years, ever since I started seriously getting into music. He is the main reason I took up the guitar 35 years ago. In the last 10 to 15 years, despite being a hard working musician, Clapton has admittedly become artistically ""lazy"" ( his words) it`s why he hasn`t written many songs lately. And at times he does seem at times to be going thru the motions and unwilling to push his talents. Happily that is not the case here, he definitely is not going thru the motions. He plays some superb solo`s and plays with verve. So this makes up for the standard material ( it would be great if he came up with some new songs tailor made for the concert experience). I could do without Tears in heaven ( a beautiful song, but too much of a downer for a live concert) and also Cocaine. But the solo on I Shot The Sheriff is great, that song always brings out his talents, and he goes above and beyond on this one! I think these performances really shine in the DVD mode, as opposed to seeing him in an arena. His setlist really is made for a club or theatre situation, so the film puts you front and center, so you can appreciate it more as opposed to sitting in Madison Square Garden 200 feet away. Also the behind the scenes really gives a feeling of comraderie and closeness Eric has with his bandmates. You can see what a nice guy Clapton is. He is very close with the Japanese Promoter, Mr. Udo. I think this film captures something, basically that Eric can still really play, and that he`s a nice guy. So this longtime EC fan really appreciates it and gives it a thumbs up!",1415232000,44,1910,4.323119777158774
6577889,3,B00MH9NEQY,"Up front, I'm a huge Eric Clapton fan.  However this disk gets a generous 3 stars because of the way the songs are presented.  If there was a way to watch the entire concert from beginning to end without the interviews being interspersed then I'd give it 4.5-5 stars.  I had the same issue with Sting's ""Bring On The Night"" DVD which I gave away to someone I don't really like.

If you're a Clapton fan and want a great concert, buy the ""One More Car, One More Rider"" DVD which, IMHO, is the best of his concert videos, by far.",1415232000,15,527,4.188118811881188
6577890,3,B00MH9NEQY,"well I just finished watching the blue ray and its so - so. I mean the playing is fine audio is good but its like Clapton is gotten to the point where he's going through the motions. And why the backup singers? On some songs they out sing Eric? what's that all about. He doesn't break a sweat on the solos as they are the same ol solos he's done for years...I'm sorry but this doesn't rank more than 3 and that's for old time sake. I would not recommend this to others. Also as a side note be aware that this is NOT a full concert with some interviews at the end, It's a song here and some commentary about what Eric is thinking or about the guys in the band and to be honest I think that is where they went wrong...to be honest I would just like to see Eric sit and play straight 12 bar blues enough said,,,",1415059200,10,808,3.993827160493827
8672301,2,B00MH9NEQY,"Given this DVD as a gift as it was missing from my Clapton collection.

 I know it's more documentary than full concert but the appealing editing of camerawork was hard to put up with. looked like an amateur holding a handheld camera doing the long shots which when closing in were like nothing I have seen before on a commercial video. Shaking all over the place. NONE of the action from this camera should have been used in the edit. Headache inducing.

Clapton and the band were, of course , great.",1508889600,,501,4.483516483516484

He is such an introspective person and this shows at how kind and respectfully  he treats people.  He is a classic and the #2 guitar player for a reason. If I need something to calm me down and remember how seemingly simple times were, Eric is the one.
