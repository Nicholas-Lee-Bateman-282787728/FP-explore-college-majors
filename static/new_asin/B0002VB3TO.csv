Ever want to have a pop tart as a snack, and open up the pack only to find that there are two in there?  You can't not eat the second one, because it'll go bad if you just leave it, so you eat it too.  But by that point, it's more like a meal, so you might as well open up the second silver pack in the box.  So you eat those and by that time, there's just the one lonely pack in the box, and you don't want it to be all alone, so you go ahead and eat it, and by that time you've had six pop tarts...

In the first few minutes Ms. Poundstone plugs Pop-Tarts in a wonderfully tounge-in-cheek way (read between the punch lines). The other four comedians give very good performances as well (sorry, at the moment I don't remember their names), presenting a nice spread of comedy styles.

If you like spending a light-hearted hour at The Improv then I'd say this tape is well worth your investment (Pop-Tarts are NOT included - as far as I'm concerned that's a good thing).",1103673600,7,732,4.7109375
