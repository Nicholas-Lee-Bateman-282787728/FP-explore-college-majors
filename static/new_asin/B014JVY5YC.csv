7413802,5,B014JVY5YC,"I gotta say that so far in my life, ""The Prismatic World Tour"" is the best concert I have ever attended to. So I was excited for the movie to relive the amazing experience this tour was to me. And I wasn't disappointed at all! ""The Prismatic World Tour"" is a tour filled with amazigness, colors, great songs, and overall the bigg production that Katy has on this tour is present on this ""movie"". The concert is edited just like it all happens live; it feels like you're actually there, and you can see how accessible Katy is while you're singing along during the 2 hours. It's the full concert, with hits from her previous albums like ""California Gurls"", ""I Kissed a Girl"", ""Teenage Dream"" among others, and almost all her newest album Prism is played on the concert, from smash hits like ""Roar"", ""Dark Horse"" and other great songs from her album like ""This Moment"" or ""Walking on Air"".  I read that the Blu-Ray/DVD will have 30 minutes of bonus features not seen on the Epix version of the concert, so I'm looking forward to watch these goodies! Overall, I really liked this tour, so it's amazing to see that it will have the Blu-Ray treatment, something that sadly didn't happened with the California Dreams Tour, but it's a must for your KP collection if you're a Katycat or if you're looking for a great concert.",1441065600,3,1316,4.552742616033755

7413817,4,B014JVY5YC,"Excellent show visually and the sound is just like being at the concert if you have an impeccable surround sound system.  Madonna set the bar exceedingly high as far as what a pop entertainment show should be, with many female pop stars following in her footsteps.  Most can barely cut it, but Katy Perry is probably one of the only ones who comes pretty close to cutting it.  This show was incredible for a pop show.  Katy Perry really puts out and wants to make sure that everyone gets their money's worth.  The show drags about mid-way through during an acoustic slow tempo set that endures for way too long.  I clocked it about thirty minutes which is obscenely long.  The songs were not that great then.  Two of my favorite songs by Katy Perry are ""Ghost"" which I was hoping she would've performed on this tour.  Could've replaced with the Grace of God song.  She did another acoustic version of ""The One That Got Away"".  That's one of her best songs in my opinion and I wish she would sing it the way it is on the album.  The uptempo version.  For a show like this, you gotta keep the energy going and when you move to a ballad set, you do one ballad song, then high tempo for awhile, squeeze in another ballad.  She spent too much time talking as well about things that were unnecessary and just boring during the slow tempo set.  Don't worry, I love Katy Perry, I think she is one of the best current pop stars out there, was just disappointed by the slow segment.  Luckily, she makes up for it in the final segment of the show, which turns into a power circus extravaganza.  Her audience seemed to be made up of 13 year old girls and the parents that brought them.  While this is an incredible entertaining show, it would be nice to see Katy evolve into more adult oriented material as this show and her last tour before this while great, are still a bit 'cutesy'.  She's approaching mid-thirties and she definitely has staying power, but would love to see her evolve even more.",1495324800,2,1987,4.40934065934066

7413821,5,B014JVY5YC,"Katy Perry really outdid herself on her ""The Prismatic World Tour"". Wow. A feast for the ears and the eyes. Love that the stage is shaped like a triangle. Love the energy and the sunny personality that Katy has when it comes to interacting with her fans. She seems like down-to-earth and genuine young lady. Great set list, crazy costume changes, awesome band and back-up dancers. This concert is fun. I think my favorite segment is the acoustic section, we get to see the serious side of Katy. Overall, I thought the whole concert was amazing. Nice picture and sound quality. Love when Katy is ""flying"" through the arena during ""Birthday"". So cute. The bonus features are ok, nothing special. The 2 hour concert is the real treat. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1486684800,,761,4.7293233082706765

I've watched it several times already, and I don't do that a lot unless it's Britney Spears, because you don't get the same feel as a live concert usually, I like to watch more than just someone singing, so having dancing, etc, keeps me entertained.

7413856,5,B014JVY5YC,"For my daughters 9th birthday I took her to go see this show. In order to have a permanent memory of this I bought this DVD. The concert was AMAZING! Her stage setup is out of this world, in fact one of the guys at the stadium we went to told us that she holds the record of ""most stuff brought on tour!"" Something like 24 Semi trucks! After seeing the show I wouldn't doubt if there were more. The DVD captures that night perfectly! DVD run time is approximately 147 minutes. Subtitles are in bonus features only: English, Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese. It was shipped fast, brand new still in plastic wrap. Comes with a booklet inside with lot of pictures from the show, and on the back of the DVD it has the list of songs that were performed along with Bonus features including behind the scenes stage set up time lapse and crew ""tidbits"". Now I can put it up so she can look back on her first concert or show her friends whenever she likes!

7413865,1,B014JVY5YC,"Katy Perry has and will always be about one thing; trying to hide the fact she has no talent. She puts everything into the show to try to distract you from the singing [which she does very little of] the backing vocals [the original studio recorded vocals] are the majority of what you hear here [and in most of her performances] because she's not confident enough to sing in front of anyone [probably since the times she has she's proven she cannot come close to hitting the notes on the studio album, without digital enhancement she could not have a career.]

It's better than the 2 hour long advertisement she made and released in theaters disguised as a documentary but it really was just about her trying to gloat about her accomplishments with fake scenes made to appear real. Which fits in perfectly with Katy Perry because everything she does is fake. You will never see anything authentic from her, including never seeing authentic talent.

I have missed Katy Perry's concert couple of times because I would be watching a movie, tv show, or a game show on TV. Since I got this DVD, I enjoy watching Katy Perry's concert most likely at night. Especially, I like it when Katy all dressed up in a Birthday suit, perform and sing ""Birthday"" where she had invited a fan to the stage to sit in the Birthday seat. Katy floated up in the air with the balloons. And all the balloons dropping all over on the audience. Plus, ""Birthday"" is my favorite song.",1451606400,2,672,4.341269841269841

It really feels like your next to the stage watching katy pretty perform every song you could want or could think of. So for most fans they will like or love this bluray relase,especially for the price. My biggest issue is that this concert seems to really be aimed at young kids. She dresses like she is on Broadway doing The Wizard of OZ or The Lion King. The songs are great but they don't match up with the song lyrics which really takes away from the experience. Her previous tour had a nice mix of performances and clothing choices that appealed to kids, teens and adults.",1447632000,2,649,4.508474576271187

However, I was very happy to see that Amazon was offering this show for FREE to Prime members, but as I know with ""On demand"", shows don't stay available forever. So I was thrilled to find this film on Blu-ray. Katy does an excellent job performing all her biggest hits. Every performance is entertaining and blast to watch. I also liked her Part of Me blu-ray, which showed more behind-the-scenes and backstory, but very little concert footage. I always wanted to see more of her concert, as I really like Katy as performer. With this release of her latest tour, you get her entire show without any interruptions. The show was filmed so well that you actually feel like you're there watching it live!. There are so many incredible, up-close shots that put you right in the center of everything.

The disc won't even register in my MacBook Pro. I have never ever had an issue before with loading a DVD or Blueray into my computer. Looks like this disc is very cheap and rough on edges. I suggest getting the digital copy!",1447113600,,359,4.373134328358209

7413886,1,B014JVY5YC,"Not that this is of any fault of Amazon, but I have already had this blu ray replaced once because it skipped, and stalled, and went in and out.  The second disc I have received does the exact same thing.  For some reason the quality of this particular blu ray is not good at all.",1447113600,,280,4.072727272727272
7413887,5,B014JVY5YC,"If you enjoy Katy's music at all, this is a must-have.  I gave this a 10 out of 10 in my IMDB review, describing it as a ""high energy extravaganza"", in which she, and her entourage of performers, put on a fantastic show.  And as the review on blu-ray.com will attest to, the disk specs are superb.  This is a BD-50 disc, and even the busiest portions of the presentation (and those are numerous) give no sign of compression artifacts.
This is one of those concerts that will make you get up out of your seat, and dance and/or sing along (as does most of the Sydney audience, attending this concert).  It's just a super-enjoyable.",1446854400,,629,4.443478260869565

I will never forget it, and her stage was massive. Im glad I had a floor seat.",1443139200,5,255,3.923076923076923
