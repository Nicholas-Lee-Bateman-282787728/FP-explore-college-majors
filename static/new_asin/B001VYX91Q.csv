8346785,1,B001VYX91Q,"Garbage!!!!!!  Small Circle Jujitsu was a legit lineage but apparently sold out, linked with a fake martial arts group GM Wally Jay would be embarrassed of this DVD!!!",1488499200,,167,4.964285714285714
8346786,4,B001VYX91Q,"The material is 5 stars.  Professor Jay has taken his dad's art further by ""focusing on the smallest point possible"" with pressure points.  However, the video transfer to DVD is subpar.  In fact, I didn't know for sure before I bought the DVD, but I had purchased this before on video cassette from GM Dillman (LJ-1), which has a better video quality.",1476144000,,351,4.629032258064516
8346787,2,B001VYX91Q,"Poorly produced, it is more of a amateur instructional video.  Not much detail on the techniques shown.",1441670400,,103,5.0588235294117645
8346788,4,B001VYX91Q,"Leon does a great job combining KYUSHO and concepts of SMALL CIRCLE into this production. A MUST HAVE for those like me who love EFFECTIVE techniques. Like the late great WALLY JAY said once ""I believe Pressure Points will be the future of Martial Arts"". Boy was he roght!

The tips given in this DVD will definitely take your Ju-Jitsu to another level.",1433462400,,353,4.603174603174603

8346792,4,B001VYX91Q,not a huge dim mak type guy but what leon does makes sense and hurts like hell...and he does exactly use that dim mak theory as mush as true pressure point theory..worth a look! want more!,1380326400,2,188,4.25
