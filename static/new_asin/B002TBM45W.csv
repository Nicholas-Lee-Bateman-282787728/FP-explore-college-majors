8380011,5,B002TBM45W,"I was extremely excited to see this value pack.  This is volume 12 and 16 of the currently discontinued Food Network show.  Some Like It Sweet includes Breakfast Eats 4, Super Sweets 6, and The Ripe Stuff, and Good Eats Greats include A Snack in the Hand, Alton's Liquid Assets, and Protein Power.  Sadly, the value pack I received contained different dvds, BUT that is more a comment on the seller than on the product itself.  We have watched much of Good Eats Greats, and it truly is great.  (Who knew there was so much to water?) It is exactly what a fan of Good Eats would expect: zany Alton Brown with fascinating facts and yummy creations.  I just wish more of these volumes were available in value packs.",1326672000,5,711,4.4728682170542635
