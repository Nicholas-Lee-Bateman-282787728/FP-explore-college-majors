8130365,2,B000GBFR0G,"This is a deserving topic for a documentary. Sadly, this is one of the worst documentaries we've ever seen.  The cinematography is truly terrible: There are odd visual choices that make no sense (repeated shots of flowers - why?); fast, jerky camera work; repeated use of the same footage; grainy footage; close-up shots of interview subjects that cut off part of the faces; and we could go on....  Daniel Berrigan deserves a better documentary!  The piece is 50 minutes long, but it felt much longer.",1462665600,,501,4.870588235294117
8130366,4,B000GBFR0G,"I recently saw Investigation of Flame and I thought it was a challenging depiction of a singular act in American history.  I hadn't heard of the Catonsville Nine before this, but after seeing the film, I understand their significance to the understanding of the anti-war movement. Lynne Sachs' film weaves in and out the variety of viewpoints from the individuals involved and the people affected by their action.  I use the word challenging because as a documentary, the film incorporates footage from the actual event with other sequences of flowers and American backyards.  While other reviewers may find this effect dizzying, I feel that it enhances our experience as we explore the past and present simultaneously.  A great film for anyone looking to learn more about that turbulent time.",1327622400,,793,5.124031007751938
8130367,5,B000GBFR0G,"Lynne Sach's short (very short) documentary on perhaps the most well known act of civil disobedience performed by the Catholic left--""The Catonsville Nine"" incident in which 7 layman and women and legendary prophet-priest-activists Father Daniel and Philip Berrigan entered a Marlyand draft board on May 17, 1968, stole draft files meant to send young men to the Vietnam war, and burned them on the lawn outside using homemade napalm is essentially a meditation on conscience.  What does it mean to be a Christian/Catholic and to be aware that we live in a nation that spends billions of dollars on *real* weapons of mass destruction while our own people--the poor, the disadvantaged, the imprisoned, innocent and guilty--are fed crumbs?

The courage of these nine men and women, Mary Murphy and her husband in particular, almost defies comprehension.  As the senseless war escalated and became more about flexing American muscle than anything else, and Vietnamese infants were increasingly returned home in caskets, these people made a move that disrupted their lives, relationships and careers forever--and many did not stop.

Sachs gives the other viewpoint a fair hearing, and a poor one it is.  The Prosecutor of the Catonsville Nine ironically quotes Thomas More, the Catholic saint who was executed for *disobeying the law on principle* in order to justify his opposition to their actions.  Mary Moylan, a draft board employee at the time of the Catonsville's stand, is perhaps one of the scariest people I have ever seen on film.  And she is an inoffensive, elderly woman.  ""I'm not in a position to judge whether a war is wrong"", she insists, ""I simply think it is our duty to support our boys out there.""  And this is decades and decades later, after everything we know about Nixon's ""secret plan"", Watergate, Johnson's admission that the war was wrong after leaving office, after even the Bush/Cheney administration.  Though this is a viscerally intense documentary with some strong and humbling figures indeed, this lady really took the cake.  Ignorance is a polluted stream which, it seems, can remained uncleansed right to the end of one's life.

People sometimes despair that there are no longer true exemplars of Christ like Mary Murphy, Tom Lewis, Daniel and Philip Berrigan: it is not so.  These same acts are committed every day around the world by figures like Father John Dear, whose&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Questions-of-Jesus-Challenging-Ourselves-to-Discover-Life-s-Great-Answers/dp/0385510071/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Questions of Jesus: Challenging Ourselves to Discover Life's Great Answers</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transfiguration-A-Meditation-on-Transforming-Ourselves-and-Our-World/dp/038551008X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transfiguration: A Meditation on Transforming Ourselves and Our World</a>are indispensable reading for any Catholic; they are simply not given attention by the mainstream media.

This also features a voice over by late anti-war activist and historian Howard Zinn, and more recent interviews with Father Daniel Berrigan, who at 90 is still alive, kicking and very active.  The message: until we see ourselves in the Other, feel their pain and then act with love to end it, we have not understood the Gospel.  A must see for any person interested remotely in what it means to stand up against what the late Pope John Paul II termed ""a culture of death"".",1286582400,4,3519,5.7384615384615385
8130368,5,B000GBFR0G,"Informative and visually exciting, Lynne Sachs's documentary shows the power of protest and re-ignited my interest in a period when Americans were so personally involved in politics that they risked their safety and personal freedom for the sake of humanist ideals.  In particular, Investigation of a Flame is a testament to the idea, ""Protest is patriotic,"" a characteristically American idea that our country nonetheless loses sight of whenever it's most urgent to keep it in focus.  Her film illuminates an important, and lesser known, episode in that period and helps me imagine that we might, at the grass-roots level, stand up again against politicians who advocate violence and death.",1172361600,6,691,5.330275229357798
8130369,2,B000GBFR0G,"This is one of the most visually annoying films I've ever seen.  The director intersperses between interviews with the surviving Catonsville 9 activists dizzying (and literally nauseating) highspeed segments of red flowers and streets that make you feel as if you're on a roller-coaster or acid.  Repeated blurred, out-of-focus shots of newspaper print add to the general visual cacaphony, and it all gets in the way of telling the marvelous, brave story of the witness for peace that took place at Catonsville in 1968.  The interviews and original footage are important.  For those with technical skills, I'd suggest buying the film and re-editing it to eliminate the distracting visual craziness.  If you do that, the film deserves 5 stars.",1169769600,4,742,5.201680672268908
8130370,5,B000GBFR0G,"This is an incredible film about how seemingly powerless individual citizens can come together to make a powerful statement, one that resonates across religious, class, ethnic and party lines, against criminal U.S. government policies. A moving look at how we are ALL responsible for what our government does, and what our obligations are as citizens to stand up for what is ethical and good.",1151020800,5,392,5.140625
8130371,5,B000GBFR0G,"I saw this film on Sundance Channel and it's wonderful. I'm glad it's coming out on DVD now. An important reminder of those years, and of what people can do peacfully if they open their hearts. Buy it and watch it and share it with your friends and family.",1150761600,5,256,4.244897959183674
