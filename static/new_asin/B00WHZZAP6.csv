7132405,4,B00WHZZAP6,"VAMPIRE HUNTER D has always been a cult favorite of many Anime fans dating all the way back to what historians would call the ""dark days of Anime"".  Back then, Anime had limited exposure to American audiences, aside from the occasional showing of children's cartoons often mangled and edited.  But with the release of Katsuhiro Otomo's controversially violent but nonetheless brilliant AKIRA, an interest in edgy, darkly animated, gritty features from the Land of the Rising Sun was ignited, and so it followed with several titles imported.  This low-budget animated direct-to-video feature from 1985 was one of them.  Based on a book by renowned Japanese Horror author Hideyuki Kikuchi sporting smoky-hazed illustrations by Yoshitaka Amano (who would later gain cult status for his work on the classic FINAL FANTASY series and later, Neil Gaiman's ""The Sandman""), VAMPIRE HUNTER D aimed to be an edgy thriller, a horror movie, and even a love story all rolled in one.  That said, critics were not unanimously ecstatic.  Reviews were mixed, with most criticisms centered on the somewhat stilted animation or sometimes inconsistent characters.  To this day, VAMPIRE HUNTER D has its share of detractors.  But it also has its share of devoted fans, many of who had grown up in the West with a dubbed version produced by the late Carl Macek and his company, Streamline Pictures.

Set in a post-apocalyptic future where vampires and mutants have overrun a human world, VAMPIRE HUNTER D begins on a dark night with a deftly choreographed action scene. Here we see Doris Lang, a courageous werewolf hunter's daughter stalking her gardens in pursuit of a T-Rex like monster with sharp teeth and scarlet eyes. Chasing it into the forest on horseback, Doris finds herself face to face with an even more imposing threat -- a hulking, shadowy vampire known as Count Magnus Lee. Naturally, the bloodthirsty aristocrat takes a drink from our heroine's jugular vein.  The following day, Doris encounters a lone figure on a cyborg horse -- a mysterious cloaked stranger called ""D.""  Desperately, she hires him. The rest of the movie involves D doing everything in his power to slay the evil count to save Doris from an eternal life as a walking undead.  Meanwhile, Doris must protect her impulsive little brother, Dan, and fend off the advances of an unwelcome suitor, the arrogant mayor's son Greco.  Matters are further complicated when D also has to deal with L'armica, Count Lee's jealous daughter, and the ambitious Rei Ginsei, a deadly noble wanna-be who will do anything to earn his master's favor. During all this, Doris falls madly in love with D -- but it turns out that her rescuer (surprise) is half-vampire himself. (This explains why his left hand has a creepy-looking face that can talk to its master or even suck up nasty creatures.)

Despite its promise of multi-threads, VAMPIRE HUNTER D turns out to be a much more simplistic story in execution, even bordering on predictable.  Somehow the viewer knows that the lead character is going to triumph in the end in spite of the obstacles he faces in his quest.  More problematic to viewers expecting flashy visuals might be the animation.  As mentioned, this is a low-budget animated feature, resulting with a cel count that borders on choppiness in places.  As such, the dramatic style of Amano's character illustrations loses a lot in the transition to screen.  Furthermore, the backgrounds, although dark and appropriately imaginative, lack detail at times.  As such, the film can seem visually dated to many viewers.  Likewise, the soundtrack shares similar qualities.  Although the sound effects are appropriately haunting and scary, at times they do sound cheesy, particularly the synthesizer sound effects when Count Lee sends rays from his eyes. The musical score from TM Network's Tetsuya Komuro is fittingly epic and sometimes spooky, although it is obviously driven by synth instruments from the '80s.

Faults aside, VAMPIRE HUNTER D still delivers some entertainment value for viewers willing to overlook such technical shortcomings. In spite of its aforementioned predictability (some might argue this movie was tailor-made for Western audiences), VAMPIRE HUNTER D delves into some complex issues: D's inner struggle to resist his own instincts when Doris makes sexual advances on him and his inability to express his true compassion to others results from some very understandable emotions. It is also intriguing to discover that the villainous Count Lee's actions are motivated mostly by the desire for sport rather than malice, although he still does exude evil in every scene. The action and fight sequences are also skillfully choreographed in the style of a samurai-slasher.

It's also important to note that this movie has its share of graphic violence--there are quite a bit of gory swordfights, resulting with stabbing, amputating, or slicing in half.  There is also one particularly disgusting moment toward the end where a character's head explodes, exposing his insides.  (A character's face is also briefly stabbed in the eye in the subsequent scene.) While all this may sound pretty extreme for squeamish viewers, the cheap production values actually make the violence less gruesome and more campy, making it easier to sit through than most bloodfests. (Even so, both Sentai's release and Streamline's version are guilty of censor in one instance; a climactic character's graphic death at the end is interspersed by a flashing red cut which feels out of place and jarring.)  There are also a few very inoffensive nude scenes. This is a movie best appreciated by an adult audience; parents should think twice before considering showing this to children.

Perhaps it's partially because of this graphic nature that VAMPIRE HUNTER D succeeded in crossover success from its native country of Japan to the West.  Dubbed in 1992, Streamline Pictures' release has been a nostalgic favorite for old school Anime fans to this day.  Having said that, critics and many fans of the time still staked it with scathing reviews. I at one time appreciated this older dub, but over the years I have grown less and less fond of it. I'm not sure what it was that turned me off from it over the years, but then I figured it out: it sounds dreadfully stiff and stilted. In all fairness, Michael McConnohie, Barbara Goodson, Jeff Winkless, Lara Cody, and Kirk Thornton are all fine voice actors.  The problem is that they were saddled into a production that veered on pure cheese and a lot of choppy-sounding dialogue ranging from mundane to laughable.  There were also instances when Macek did a bit of tampering with the music, extending Komuro's score longer than usual sometimes sounding out of place with the visuals.  Most infamously, the opening scene in which Doris is confronted by the Count has a rather corny ""permit me to introduce"" myself monologue which not only diluted the mood, it gave a very laughable quality that sadly would be exacerbated by phony Transylvanian accents and even a groan worthy love confession ripped off from THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (Doris:  I love you.  D:  I know.)  The sound quality was quite bad, too, although that may be on the fault of the equipment used at the time, so I wouldn't dock the dub against it.  This same dub was retained on Urban Vision's DVD release, which likewise used Streamline's cut of the film (which aside from the aforementioned censor, was otherwise uncut), resulting in a lot of heavy over saturation and muddy images.

Now, thirty years after its debut in 1985, Sentai Filmworks has brought this title back from the dead and given it a fresh new coat of paint er, fresh blood.  (Get it?)  Remastered from the original film elements, this movie has never looked better.  The colors literally spring to life off the screen and sequences compromised by an overuse of darkness are brighter.  It really does feel like a totally new movie in and of itself.  The only drawback of the transfer is the occasional sight of speckles on the print (mostly dust particles accumulated on the cel before the camera photographed it), but otherwise, the video quality is amazing with a capital ""A.""

In what may be a controversial move to fans of the Streamline dub, Sentai Filmworks has opted not to include that version on its BD release, but instead provide a brand new version.  This will likely be a point of contention, as a lot of Streamline titles which received new dubs (AKIRA, CASTLE IN THE SKY, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, NADIA--THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER, CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO, GETTER ROBO, 3x3 EYES) have often been harshly maligned by old school fans, even though some might argue in the cases of some of those films, these newer versions were sorely needed, as a lot of these older dubs hadn't aged well at all.

I do have a couple of minor issues regarding Sentai's newer dub, but unlike the Streamline version, this revamp, headed by Matt Greenfield of ADV fame, does a very commendable job of bringing the movie closer to its more serious intent, stripping it of much of the unintentional humor.  The script is a fresh new translation of the original Japanese and sounds much better written and more natural, giving a more ""adult"" vibe.  As far as the voices are concerned, the weakest voice of the dub is the same character that I had similar issues with in the Streamline version:  that of Dan, Doris' little brother.  In all fairness, Shannon Emerick does bring a bit more spunk to the role, but her voice, like her older dub counterpart, still strikes me as unconvincing for a little boy (at least she's not as distractingly feminine, though, thank goodness!).  Otherwise, the rest of the cast is appropriate and well-fitting for the most part.  I will always prefer Andrew Philpot and Mike McShane as D and his chatty left hand from Yoshiaki Kawajiri's later semi-sequel VAMPIRE HUNTER D:  BLOODLUST; however, John Gremillion's performance as the title character is still a big improvement over that of McConnohie from the original, sounding far less cheesy and more natural throughout.  As D's left hand, Andy McAvin, who also plays Rei Ginsei, is also thankfully less nasally than his Streamline counterpart, and even gets the best line:  ""This guy is quite a HAND-ful.""  Luci Christian also sounds much more convincing and puts a lot more emotion into her role as Doris, making her a sympathetic character and her dialogue is thankfully free of any Kate Capshaw-isms.  However, it's David Wald who really steals the show; as Count Magnus Lee, Wald has a smooth, regal-sounding baritone who sounds somewhat similar to Keith David.  He's also very charismatic and dripping with pure evil; a HUGE improvement over Jeff Winkless' laughably stilted turn in the Streamline dub (the fake sound vocal effects not even helping).  Surprisingly, both he and his daughter, L'armica (Brittany Karbowski) are both given upper-class accents as opposed to the Transylvanian ones in the older one; frankly, though, I think it's all the better for it.  It's a bit of a surprise that the people of Doris' village, including Greco, are given Southern accents until one remembers that this is supposed to be a ""Western"" vampire.  It takes some getting used to, particularly in the case of Jay Hickman's drawling Greco, but having said that the actor does provide a bit of a slightly humorous touch to the role, giving him more character than Steve Bulen's too wispy-sounding and not forceful enough turn.  The sound mix also sounds really good; not only are the voices better recorded, the music and sound effects also much more crisper than the Streamline version -- even mixed to 5.1, on the DVD it still sounded very muddy.  As mentioned, Streamline's dub was not well received by the Anime community; time will tell if Sentai's newer dub gets better recognition (although Streamline loyalists will find it jarring either way), but as far as I'm concerned, this is a huge improvement over the original.  (And yes, purists, the Japanese version IS still on the Blu Ray, complete with subtitles -- and for the first time, the ending song ""Your Song"" is translated!)

The only slight negative about Sentai's otherwise stunning BluRay is that there aren't enough extras.  Urban Vision's DVD has the upper hand when it comes to that; aside from the Japanese trailer (the only thing from that release which is still retained here), there was also a ""making of"" featurette featuring director Toyoo Ashida and members of the original Japanese cast recording their roles.  That is sorely missed, as is a video game preview and a gallery from Amano.  If you still have your Urban Vision DVDs, you might wanna hold onto them just for that.

On the whole, though, Sentai deserves a shootout for their reworking of this fan favorite.  Not only does it look amazing, it sounds better than ever.  More importantly, it gives what some might consider a lesser animated feature new life.  I still maintain that Kawajiri's VAMPIRE HUNTER D:  BLOODLUST is the superior version of this tale -- much more complex and ambiguous -- but having said that I recommend this newer edition of the original.  It truly prowls the night.",1438041600,7,13213,4.972272727272728
7132406,3,B00WHZZAP6,"If you look at the back cover pics of the final box, it says 'upgraded audio tracks' which in fact it isn't. Matter in fact, the original English dub track isn't even on this release! Sentai more or less has said, they didn't want to acquire the license for it on their Q&A page. The original Dvd release had a 5.1 Dolby English track, that had some nifty mixing and surround effects to it. And was the original Carel Macek dub. Which you can go on Sentais youtube, and listen to some of the new clips yourself. Very generic sounding.
Video on the other hand, will be subjected. Quality in general seems to be much higher than the original dvd! Which wasn't great, but anime in 2000 wasn't mastered that great in general. But! As you can tell from the shots, the skin tones are very, very different. Going from a warm tone on the original, to more a cool tone on the remaster. It certainly isn't anything as awful as funimation has done with Dragonball Z in recent years, thats for sure.
So I think its a mixed bag here. If you're new to Vampire Hunter D, you're probably better off starting with this blu-ray release. But if you're a purist or want a great english dub, this might be more a rental for you and be better off tracking the original Urban Vision release.",1437955200,39,1268,4.377118644067797
7132407,5,B00WHZZAP6,"A cult classic that's made even better on blu ray. They cleaned it up nicely. I don't really know what else I can really add to the reviews that hasn't already been said. All I know is I consider Vampire Hunter D one of four must watch / own animes with Akira, Ghost in the Shell and Revolutionary Girl Utena being the other three.

Be forewarned, the English dub has been changed to a newer dub with the older dub not on this disc. They'll probably add it in, just like Funimation did with Akira, on a later release. I find the new dub watchable but I'm definitely missing the old dub as I've never watched this in Japanese as I liked the dub that much.

If you're an anime fan, regardless if old or new, you owe it to yourself to get this blu ray. Even if you're put off with Sentai getting rid of the old dub, like myself, you can still watch it in Japanese.

Oh, this is a bare bones blu ray release. All you're getting is the movie, Japanese trailer, and trailers of Devil Survivor 2, Murdock Scramble, Ninja Scroll and Nobunaga the Fool.

I added some pictures just so you guys can see the difference between the blu ray and old DVD release. It's not the greatest, as I just took it from my phone, but you should still be able to see the difference.",1437350400,44,1255,4.195020746887967

7132409,3,B00WHZZAP6,"VHD is right up there with Akira and Ninja Scroll and was one of Streamlines first releases in US on LD and VHS.

Vampire Hunter D was the first Adult Anime I watched backed in the 90s on Cartoon Network. It was an instant classic and one of my all time favorites. Before this release, all we had was a SD DVD version made from low-quality analog tapes.

Video: New film transfer, 1080p. The print quality looks about the same as the German print, except no cropping it is 4:3. Ending is clean as the Streamline credits were never on the film and ending song is now translated in subs. The only ""strange"" issue is the short scene where the count dies at the end is still replaced with flashing red. I know people claim it is censored but anyone who has watched it knows it's not exactly the most gory part of the movie, rei's head exploding is far worse. Also that scene's art is a bit weird, it doesn't really match well, so it maybe removed because red looks better.

Audio: The original Japanese audio is fair, no 5.1 mix only the original 2.0 but no major changes. The new English dub is terrible and is also only 2.0, again no 5.1 mix. Typical Matt Greenfield AD Vision low-budget dubbing (Matt & AD Vision made some of the cheapest English dubs in US anime history and he is behind this company). The voices are inconsistent between lousy US Southern Accents and lousy UK British accents - make up your mind which to use and get people who can do it right as these actors suck.

The count no longer has a Transylvanian accent, he now he talks with a lousy UK British poorly imitated accent. All of the voices are low-budget no-talent typical AD Vision/Matt Greenfield garbage! You can say whatever you want about Carl Macek but at least he used ""professional"" actors not run of the mill radio DJs and wannabes.

Overall: If you don't mind the Japanese subs then this is recommended. If you are more concerned on the English dubbing you may want to pass or also buy a copy of the DVD and remux and resync in an MKV file (for those of you know how to) as this English garbage is amateur junk! The so-called new translation is equally as bad. ""Mr. D! Mr. D! - right from the 80's Different Strokes annoying nonsense!""",1431388800,2,2220,4.391727493917275
7132410,4,B00WHZZAP6,"He looks like a medieval cowboy, rides a cyborg horse, and roams a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Vampire Hunter D is undeniably one of the coolest vampire-slaying antiheroes out there.

And his coolness is on display in ""Vampire Hunter D,"" a classic anime that mingles together a Wild-West sensibility with gothic horror and plenty of sci-fi weirdness. There are some aspects of the story and its world that could have used some explaining (what exactly is the purpose of all those weird mutant creatures?), but it rides high on atmosphere and a strangely appealing ""dunpeel"" protagonist whose mission is to rid the world of all vampires.

Farmgirl Doris Lang stops a sword-carrying man on a cyborg horse, demanding that he hand over his sword. When he demonstrates that he can defend himself, she reveals that she was just testing him, and she needs his help. Doris has been bitten by the vampire Magnus Lee, and needs this young man -- who calls himself ""D"" -- to save her and her little brother from the vampire. And they need his help fast, since the locals will deal swiftly with a suspected vampire victim.

Fortunately, D is all too willing to hunt down and kill Lee, because his mission is to destroy all vampires... even though he is part vampire himself. But to deal with Lee, D must venture into a disgusting, labyrinthine castle, dealing with demonic serpent-women, lethal mutants, and the Count's own cruel daughter Lamika. And if he's not careful, the most ruthless of Lee's servants might actually be able to kill him.

The world of ""Vampire Hunter D,"" originally concocted by Hideyuki Kikuchi, is a pretty fascinating one. It's over ten thousand years in the future, in the waning days of a vampire empire that ran the whole planet, and Earth is overrun with vampires, werewolves, mutants, dinosaur-like animals and cyborgs. It's a gloriously rough, wild kind of world, sort of a postapocalyptic Wild West where mankind is constantly threatened by monsters.

And that setting is both a blessing and a curse. It gives it a fresh, un-cliched approach to vampire horror, and presents the powerful hero with some genuinely terrible threats. On the other.... it means it's cluttered with a lot of weird, freaky-looking things that exist for the purpose of being weird and freaky-looking.

The story itself is a dark affair, haunted by a grinding sense of increasing fear as D sinks deeper into the twisted castle and its even more twisted inhabitants. Most of the story takes place in darkness, with splashes of color (like the undulating green hair of the serpent-women) that briefly break through the overcast animation. It also has a LOT of gore -- D's favorite move seems to be to slice his opponent in half, and then just keep going. Lots of splatters of blood, impalement and chunks of flying creature.

The only lighter moments come from D's left hand.... seriously, his left hand has a sentient face in it that can suck things into itself like a black hole, and which even can do CPR when he's out of commission. This character is never really explained, but his dry, wickedly barbed commentary keeps things amusing.

D himself is the story's greatest selling point -- powerful but not invincible, clearly with vampiric tendencies but determined not to give in to them. He's a graceful, silent figure that quietly wafts through the story, dominating every scene -- and every person -- he comes across, and capable of great kindness as well as great brutality. Beside him, most of the other characters seem pretty unimpressive, from the foppish creepy mayor's son to the bored, elderly Count Lee -- the one exception is Rei, a brutal mutant whose only goal is to become a Noble, and who has a very personal grudge against D.

As for the animation, it's... rather dated. It has that stylized 1980s look, with girls with round faces and men with long angular bodies. And it has an odd tendency to vacillate between animation that is fluid and beautiful... and some very awkward, choppy editing and awkward looped animation that simply hasn't aged well. D's impalement, for instance, looks more silly than horrifying as he floats at a forty-five degree angle and yowls with his arms outstretched.

While it has some flaws -- mainly the dated animation -- ""Vampire Hunter D"" is a literally dark, gory adventure that takes us into a future where vampires rule. If nothing else, watch it for the brutal violence and the very atypical take on vampires.",1431129600,2,4461,4.865612648221344

Let's start with the pros: This is a good old fashioned retro anime and a classic of the genre. It's a real blast to the past and is full of that '80s veneer you can't find any more. The animation is beautiful and completely hand drawn (to my knowledge). It's got some nice atmosphere and some good characters, especially D.

Now, for the lost star: This movie and its story is... well, the only way I can say it is that it does its own thing. That's not necessarily bad, but the pacing is all over the place. Some very important character decisions are made with no explanation whatsoever, and very little is revealed about any backstories and such. Also, there may be scenes (the Medusa scene in particular) that seem to say ""I'm here, whatchya gonna do about it?"" They feel almost out of place. While beautiful, the hand drawn animation does lead to a lot of (and sometimes humorous) off-model characters. Also you WILL notice the exact same shots in many different fight scenes, as they reused animation quite a bit.

Overall, I still recommend this movie. It made a very enjoyable evening for me. Just don't expect a ton of deep characters or absolute perfection and you'll be fine.",1483660800,,1288,4.543103448275862

An ex ample the voice of Greico is no longer a Europian type voice, the character in the movie now has a thick southern accent. I am also displeased that the listing for the movie does not state this. There is also no option to play the original dub.  This is just not vampire hunter D anymore.

If you've seen the movie with the original voices just watch it in Japanese.  Again I can't stress the clarity of the animation is.

7132469,5,B00WHZZAP6,"Dungeons and Dragons meets Castlevania in this great dark fantasy adventure featuring demons, vampires, mutants, cyborgs, castle lairs and magical items.  If you like Anime or dark fantasy you should probably see this.

The future is populated by demons and mutants, dinosaurs and werewolves, and all manner of supernatural creatures and mystical magical items with unexplained names like ""the time-bewitching incense.""  Sounds like a dream to any Dungeons and Dragons fan, if you ask me.  And that's exactly what I am!

Not at all as perverse or provocative as its unrelated successor Wicked City (1987), Vampire Hunter D (1985) features nothing more risqu than a few boob shots and some frequent panty glances of our strong protagonist Doris.  She can hold her own and handles a whip pretty well, but having been bitten by the 10,000-year old Count (Dracula), she hires D--a wispy and mysterious hunter, riding atop his fiendishly horned cybernetic horse.

The Dhampir offspring of a vampire and a human (like Blade), D is a most formidable swordsman bearing an antagonistic face that never shuts up on his right hand and the ability to regenerate.  His eyes glow when we embraces his true nature.

Defending Doris from the romantic interests of the noble vampiric Count, D combats his mutant servants imbued with all manner of time-space-bending and magical powers.  One particularly weird henchman emits spiders from him porous hunchback--yuck.

In his Castlevania meets classic Dungeons and Dragons dungeon crawl he faces the shape-shifting life-draining lamia (which strike me more as a mix of sirens and naga), traps, ghosts, a witch, a pterodactyl man, a giant, and ultimately the revered noble vampire.  It's a fun mix of enemies.

The Count possesses a most powerful telekinesis which contributes some festive gore, complete with dismemberment, blood geysers, eyeball gauges and an exploding head.  All in an effort to prevent the Count from forcibly wedding Doris in his gigantic castle attended by all manner of hooded minion monks.

As the story progresses we learn that D is more powerful and more important than he lets on, but even by the end some mysteries remain as he exits to parts unknown, much as he arrived.  Perhaps these are mysteries answered in the Manga books.

This movie was a blast when I was a kid and still maintains its entertainment value today.  It reminds me of my Dungeons and Dragons days in the best way.",1459641600,,2444,5.052369077306733

7132485,3,B00WHZZAP6,"Wow... what happened to the audio here?  Vampire Hunter D has never LOOKED so great, and sounded so off!  What was wrong with these people who did this?!  At times the translation and thus the dialogue is closer to the book, more accurate e.g. the ""Time Bewitching Incense"", and most of the characters' voices are alright EXCEPT for D, and Larmeka.

The actor who is doing D this time either took it upon himself to use as a future audition for doing Batman voice overs, or was directed to do so.  Larmeka's voice sounds way too childish for a vampire noblewoman who has been alive for some time.  Then there's the dialogue changes, sometimes they sound like they belong to a totally different movie.  If only we could marry the original audio track with the new video that would be perfect.  Yes the original has some odd bits here and there - it didn't have the benefit of years of VHD releases in Manga and Books.  Despite that flaw, the original manages to be more true to the spirit of the book, which I read years ago.

If you've never seen VHD before, and you're picky about having the best video quality then naturally you'll get this.  If you HAVE and just want a better picture quality for a different experience, go ahead and get this.  Larmeka's final dialogue with D in THIS version is terrible, making her sound like a wishy-washy individual rather than a conflicted one.  D also comes across much weirder in this one, it's rather jarring if you're a fan as I am having read a majority of the books.",1448755200,3,1513,4.478102189781022

7132490,2,B00WHZZAP6,"Vampire Hunter D came out in 1985 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090248/ ). Soon after, it was released in the United States with a pretty good dub. The review the follows is of the Blu-ray release WITH THE NEW DUB, not the original dub from the 1980s.

VIDEO QUALITY (4.5 stars for image quality; 2 stars for editing)  The quality of the video and imagery on the Blu-ray is borderline astounding. The images appear as if they were made for hi-def.  The subtlety of the shadows and darker sections of the character art are superb. The blood in particular is more realistic and more gory in its liquid red squishiness. DESPITE THIS, this edition of Vampire Hunter D is an abject failure.
The editing of this edition of Vampire Hunter D on Blu-ray seems to randomly chop out important parts of the story. Additionally, there seems to be a few tiny pieces from the cutting room floor that have been jammed back in. The editing removes scenes between Doris and Count Lee, several scenes between Doris and Vampire Hunter D, and some scenes between Vampire Hunter D and Doriss brother Dan. There are other editing tricks throughout that do NOT enhance the story and remove much of the original feel of the movie. In all instances, this poor editing is a detriment to the movie.

DUB QUALITY/AUDIO QUALITY (1.5 stars)  The new dub (the new voice over) on this Blu-ray release of Vampire Hunter D is horrible. The first notable scene where they changed it, outside of the obvious new voice actors, is between Count Lee and Doris. Second is where Doris tells D this is where Magnus Lee kissed me, only the new version completely rewrites the dialogue to say something completely different. Why did they rewrite the excellent classic dialogue of this movie? Die Hard fans are going to raise cain over the changes. Spend the coin and charge a little more for the movie if you must, but don't change it. We paid good money for an old movie because we LOVED THE ORRIGINAL. We do not love a new cover of the old classic. If we want new, we would buy Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, not this.

Additionally, what is with Lamikas strange accent? Its a mix of deep south, maybe Georgia or the Carolinas mixed with a badly put on British accent. Dan has a barley hidden deep, I mean DEEP SOUTH, accent  Maybe Alabama or Arkansas. Vampire Hunter D is not a comedy. Start throwing around a yall here and there and you destroy the movie  CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORDS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH !?!?!?!?!?!",1447459200,3,2484,4.616780045351474
7132491,2,B00WHZZAP6,"Picked this up on bluray and just popped in the disc. 20 minutes in and I'm pretty disappointed. First thing I noticed is that they changed out every character's voice and even some of the dialogue. They also removed a scene from the beginning where Doris first meets the Count. In all honesty some of the new voice overs are bad. Bad in the way that some don't even sound like the characters they're portraying and some boast rough, borderline cheesy, sounding accents.  Almost none sound remotely close to the originals. And as I mentioned up top, some scenes are edited out for whatever reason. In summation; If I could easily take this movie back, I would, but I ordered away for it. So, if you're like me and you were hoping to geta fully polished bluray quality version of the original you loved and grew up with, you won't find it here in the new bluray version. Ya, the movie looks a lot nicer than my original vhs or dvd copy, but it feels like a bastardized version of the classic. If you haven't seen the original and are instead seeing this movie for the very first time you may very well like it which is  all well and good. But for some of those who grew up with the original; it falls short of the mark. But on the other hand; if not having the original voice actors on board, missing scenes from the original, and the dialogue being subtly altered isn't a deal breaker for you, go for it.

If you prefer watching the movie in Japanese audio with English subs then this is not a major issue for you, but as someone who first saw the movie on television years ago with the original English dub, I am disappointed by the omission thereof.

7132512,3,B00WHZZAP6,"I saw this movie for the first time on Youtube and it was the original dub.  The vampire nobles had Russian accents, the music was creepy, the monsters sounded original and inspired.  This remake does away with the original dub and introduces an absolutely horrible American dub.  The guy who voices Count Magnus Lee just sounds like an average bored American CEO type.  His daughter sounds like a whiny teenage white girl.

D himself sounds ok but the monsters sound extremely generic.  In the original they sounded genuinely creepy, here it sounds like they used some stock monster sound effects and voices.  It's so generic.

I think the main problem with this dub is that the American company did not take this movie seriously.  They tried to dub it in a way in which it could be presented to children.  This movie is for adults and not for children. It's very violent and has gratuitous nudity.  Having said that, this Blu-ray version of the film is treated as a cartoon for children.  Very disrespectful to the source material and to what this movie actually represents.

I also noticed that his version has some scenes cut out.  The most significant is the scene where Count Magnus Lee introduces himself to Doris at the beginning of the film.  The movie cuts straight to the title right before that scene takes place, which is a real shame.

I'm glad I bought this film just to have as reference but quite honestly this English dub nearly ruins the movie.  I think I would rather watch it without sound.  I'll hold out until they release the original English dub version.",1441929600,72,1579,4.68

7132519,4,B00WHZZAP6,"Vampire Hunter D is a classic direct-to-video(OVA) anime film released in 1985. The title character D comes across a young woman named Doris Lang. Doris has been bitten by Count Magnus Lee, a very old and powerful vampire and now she wants D's help in killing the Count. Vampire Hunter D is considered a cult classic by many longtime anime fans. The story is great and easy to follow. The atmosphere and music are haunting as well. Probably in anyone's top ten anime films to watch on Halloween.

The Remastered HD picture is very nice and appreciated despite the low production values becoming more apparent because of the HD Master. But I already knew this wasn't on the same level as something like ""Akira"". There's one major problem with this release and that's the new english dub. The new dub is ok, but it sounds really awkward at times. There's even dialogue from Greco making reference to an old American Tv show titled ""Have Gun - Will Travel"". They even give him a southern accent. Dan has the accent as well, but for some reason his sister Doris doesn't. Another example is when Doris says to D ""They're blood sucking monsters, um... present company excepted"". Streamline dub handled that way better. There are places where the dialogue is good and some where it isn't. This release gets only 4 stars, but it would have gotten 5 if the new dub was actually an improvement over the old one.

The colors are bright even with the scenes with visible grain and dirt. If you don't own this anime or are looking to upgrade your quality this is still any recommendation.

Where the film really stumbles is the English dub. If you are purist and only watch the Japanese voice track then this really is the best version of Vampire Hunter D available stateside. However, if you enjoy English dubs your enjoyment of this English track is subjective. Having grown up with the original Streamline dub it is awful, clched, and absolutely awesome. There are lots of unintentionally funny lines but they don't ruin the story or make it feel like a parody. It all strangely works. The latest dub plays it very serious delivering and for me I slightly distracting. The villagers in this latest dub are depicted with heavy Texas/Southern styled accents which was a bit jarring given the post apocalyptic setting. Both dubs are competent but I prefer the original streamline version.

The reason why it is in full screen format is because this was the original presentation aspect ratio since this is an OVA (Original Video Anime).

It gives Doris and her brother slightly ""country"" accents while D's voice remains perfectly passable, and the vampire royalty have been given British accents.

7132531,1,B00WHZZAP6,"I agree with all fans of the original English dub- the new English, rewritten dub ruins this blue ray. If I had known beforehand about this I would not have bought it. The new dub has no character or charm as in the original and the new script overstates things- as if aiming at a younger audience who isn't mature enough to infer themes and ideas through paying attention- and sounds extremely corny and obnoxious at times. It's just terrible! If you are a fan of the original you will notice it right away and most likely feel your heart drop when you hit the audio button on the remote and realize this is the only English audio option. Maybe then you'll go to the main menu screen to see if you access another audio option from there at which point you'll be assaulted by one of the most obnoxious and inappropriate menu screen musical themes of all time!
PS- the picture quality is beautiful, although I have heard some complain over over-brightening the color palate. This may be true but I can't make it through the movie with this audio track so it would be senseless to compare for me. I will not be keeping this Blu Ray.
And for those that recommend the picture quality of the Blu Ray but to not get rid of the DVD yet- I don't see the point. Have two copies? One for the picture and one for the audio? How is this supposed to add up to an enjoyable viewing experience?
Get the DVD or the VHS- that's all I can say. The picture quality is not that bad at all and the audio is light years better.
As for the Japanese audio track, I cant speak to that. I am unfamiliar with it. I am not sure if it is original or redone as well but I bought this on Blu fit the English dub which was one of the best English dubs of an anime movie ever imo.

AUDIO
And so instead of explaining why I like this anime, the real concern of this write-up is for the fans of this movie who wanna know whether or not the new dub is any good. Well... it's bad. Serviceable, but bad. All the voice actors do their job as fine as they can, I suppose. But the glaring flaw with this new cast is that no one sounds distinct. There's no ""presence"" radiating from any one character in this anime, and it actually succeeds at making the movie boring. Character interactions come off as very matter-of-fact like, and the changes to the script lines from the original dub's translation somehow sound stupider with this new one's translation.

Even though the same idea of any scene comes across when comparing the two dubs, the overall fun of that Streamline translation is lost due to the subtle words and phrases that are altered. Like in the older dub, when Rei says to Doris, ""Put your tongue back in your mouth. It's bad manners."" It's now changed to ""Now put that back in your mouth. It's crude."" This comes after a ridiculous line reading in the new dub of Rei explaining (in monotone), ""Quiet. Cease struggling. The Count's waited long enough."" Rei's now lost his snarky personality from the original. He's just plain and uninteresting on top of his new voice actor not sounding all that menacing anyways. And then simple ideas, like the original description of the incense candle as being ""the candle's light"" is now overly complicated and constantly referred to, and yelled out as being, ""the time bewitching incense."" It's as if the candle is some super move activation, like it was a Kamehameha or Rasengan from an action anime made for little kids to imitate. I know it was expressed like that in the Japanese audio. But blatantly recreating it in English doesn't make it any good here cuz it sounds foolish in our language. Then, there's also changes to the character's voices that have no reasoning behind them. Greco is given a Southern country-boy dialect, while D's hand is given an odd effect to it's voice to make it sound ""other-worldly"" (I guess??). They're vocal decisions being made by the new dub authors that just have no rhyme or reason to the story of the movie (it's not like Doris or Dan or the Doctor have a country inflection to their voices, so why should Greco?).

Musical ques and sound affects are generally kept the same as before. But with the new 2.0 mix given to us here, there are slight changes in either the way they're coming out of the speaker OR it's just that the new dub had to recreate certain audio sounds, and they're different entirely. It's not too bad, but older fans like myself who know the original dub so well will notice these things.

VIDEO
Also, I wanna say that the video is pretty good, but not great. There are excellent colors and details that can be seen that probably haven't been visible since it's original release in 1985 Japan. But there are a few issues I noticed throughout that might cause an eyebrow to raise. You'll probably see select screen caps from any random website review that promote the entire movie's picture as being superb, but it isn't.

One is the dust particles that have been left in certain scenes. Some scenes have very little, and are not an eyesore in the slightest. Other scenes, most notably the darker ones with Count Lee (his intro in particular), are bad. You'll have a pure black background with flecks and white spots everywhere, that are super glaring because the scene is static and still. When there's no movement on screen, the dust will just sit there. But when a character blinks, or the count moves his cape, or any animated movements happen, you see all the white spots flush around from the original film reel moving, and it makes a rather dramatic image look cheap and dirty.

There are also a couple of scenes where the image is blurry and nowhere near as sharp as the rest of the movie. It really makes no sense, and none of the blurry scenes last longer than a couple of seconds. But they are key scenes that you're paying attention to, so it makes one wonder just what happened that they would exist in this at all? Maybe there was a tight balance to be had, because other problematic scenes have an upconvert where thinner black lines are partially eliminated from the screen (like hair and face details) while you can also see some compression artifacts showing up in random areas. Maybe it's just that the blurry scenes lost too many details, and the bad upconvert scenes looked even worse if they were left blurred, so you had to choose between one or the other? Who knows...

OVERALL
But in the end, this is an excellent purchase, if you stick with the Japanese audio. There's a lot of good video restoration done that every prior release of this movie has never had, and it's fun to see things that you (I) had never noticed before because the print was too dark. But just like I said above, keep your original Streamline dub copy of this movie if you want to hear a really fun (dare I say perfect?) dub, because this new one is pretty by-the-books and lousy. How any reviews or fan forum comments about this movie needing and welcoming a new dub is okay because Streamlines was cheesy and old is beyond me when hearing this new one. Streamline had a fun script; Streamline had distinct voice actors; and Streamline gave us something worthy of a Hammer Horror movie experience, which is what the Vampire Hunter D franchise is entirely based around. This new dub just screams ""we're better because we're current and modern,"" and that's just not true in the slightest.",1440633600,7,5853,4.5791984732824424

7132536,4,B00WHZZAP6,"I had a review up early for this product, but after a lot of thought decided to delete my previous review.

For older fans its hard not to compare both English Dubs. We grew up with Vampire Hunter D in a time where Streamline`s Dub was the only one available to a American audience. The first time I watched Vampire Hunter D was when I was 10 , and it aired on TBS late night right after Heavy Metal.
The Japanese version did not become fully available till the late 90s and early 2000s to American fans.
When Urban Vision went out of business prices for dvd copies for Vampire Hunter D OAV and the film Bloodlust skyrocketed. Believe me I was very lucky to find a decent price for a used copy.

Enter 2015 when Sentai Flimworks announces they had gained the distribution rights to the anime classic, however that release had one catch. The original English Dub would not be added. Instead a newly produced English Dub that was closer to the original Japanese version in terms of script was put in place. I really do wish that Sentai had been able to add the original dub because it really would have meant a lot to old fans, and it would have made excellent fair point of comparison.

English Dubs in themselves truly are hit or miss. Sentai Filmworks Dub strength relies heavily on the new script, but the new dub still  at times comes off feeling generic. I do agree that Streamline had better performances, and cheesy as the script  was it never took away the entertainment value or the plot.  Vampire Hunter D is post apocalyptic sci-fi B-movie horror western that happens to be animated.  What`s not cheesy?

I think new fans and most older fans will enjoy this DVD/BluRay release. It does include the original Japanese Dub with English Subtitles.
The remastered animation makes the purchase and adding it to your collection worth it.

I would however recommend renting this or watching it when it becomes available to stream before buying it out right. If that is not possible wait for it to be discounted.

Personally I found this to be a decent purchase. The new English Dub  has its strengths and weaknesses , but it does not take away from the plot or  the viewing experience. Video quality is excellent.",1440547200,14,2215,4.565656565656566
7132537,4,B00WHZZAP6,"First so it's clear, this is a huge upgrade from the old DVD, which suffered from a poor transfer and crushed blacks. The Blu Ray remaster has detail that was blacked out in the old release, and is overall a more authentic experience with the original title screen and no more English credits marching over the ending sequence. There were actually a couple scenes on the DVD when I couldn't make out the action - just a black screen with a few smudges of color. Now even in the dimmest scenes everything is visible, even the shadows on D's hat. Colors are soft and pleasing, especially in daylight scenes. You gain more appreciation for the artwork when you can see it.

The Japanese audio got an impressive upgrade too, it sounds really crisp. My only complaint there is the music seems softer, I remember there being a better balance on the DVD. But it sounds fantastic just the same.

I haven't fully listened to the new English dub. When I started the movie I just hit play to see which dub it would select. I was...a little underwhelmed, but that may be partly because I'm fond of the original English dub. I'm not saying the new dub is bad, I just didn't feel like giving it a chance on first viewing. I switched to Japanese and didn't go back. The Japanese voice actors just nail the setting anyway.

I don't know much Japanese, but there were a few spots when I thought the subtitles might be more accurate in this release. Don't take my word for it, it was just my impression.

There's only one extra, which is a Japanese trailer. But I was surprised to find they restored that too! Both the video and audio is in HD, which is above and beyond. The restoration team obviously did a lot of work on this.

That said, I was disappointed that there weren't any interviews. Maybe it shouldn't be too surprising, Vampire Hunter D has never gotten very good marketing treatment, so when I saw they had done a Blu Ray remaster that was enough for me. But since this is a movie that got many American fans interested in anime, some interviews with creators would have been appropriate and made this a stellar release.

In fact it's funny that the packaging is just as barebones. It's just one of those flimsier feeling new Blu Ray cases, with no slipcover or inserts. And that's fine...but they could have done this much more justice. The release is a pretty big deal, yet you wouldn't know it from the packaging.

For not including more extras, lack of the original English dub and unimpressive packaging I'll take off one star.

But don't take any of that to mean I'm not fully recommending this. Whether for D fans, anime fans or vampire fiction fans, it belongs in your library. If you loved the old English dub then hold onto that, but get this too! You won't regret it.",1440547200,4,2775,4.492063492063492
7132538,5,B00WHZZAP6,"There's been a number of reviews complaining about this release not having the Streamline Pictures dub.  However, I'm not among them!  The ""new"" dub is a refreshing improvement.  It gets rid of some of the ""corny"" dialog from the previous dub.  I understand some of the complaints.  But Carl Macek's dub is 25 years old.  His dub mentions ""Count Magnus Lee"" so many times, it's almost a pronoun!  This dub also does away with the ""Bela Lugosi-Romanian"" accent.  Again, another good change (in my opinion). These are novel attempts to improve a 30 year old OVA.  What Sentai Filmworks should absolutely be applauded for is the vast improvement in the picture.  I'm not a huge fan of windowboxed presentations.  But it makes OVAs (generally full-framed), look exceptional.  What I didn't like about Urban Vision's release is how dark it was in several spots.  Sentai has fixed all of those problems with this release!  They have also restored all footage, including the beginning and ending credits.  This brings the total running time to the correct 82 minutes.  Not the 80 minutes on all other previous releases.

7132539,4,B00WHZZAP6,"PROS:
* The remaster is beautiful! There are extra little details that really come out. At times this looks like a brand new anime, not one released in 1985!

*This is a new dub of the movie. Some of the voice are hit and miss. John Gremillion does a decent job as D but nothing beats Michael McConnohie!

*New dub means new script. It seems to follow more of the novel than anything else. There were some scenes I felt the lines were better in the original but still good.

CONS:

*Some of the voices are just horrible! They added a super western/texan draw to people like Dan (Oh my  god his voice was super annoying) Greco and the other towns people just seem like they said ""Yeah, future western, super Texas won't sound annoying at all!

*Blu-ray does not have the original english dub. No other extras besides the original Japanese Trailer and some other animes Sentai released.

Boy, was i disappointed. First, they have added things that were not in the original (narration at the very beginning), they have redone the original voicework, which was amazing even to this day, with a ho hum generic sounding dub. Lastly and the biggest gripe I have is that they changed the entire script and some words with it. They call D a ""dunpeer"", not a danpeel and don't get me started on how they say Rei Ginsei's name. On the bright side, the quality is incredible. They cleaned it up very well for a 1980's movie in general. Colors pop out and you will see things you haven't seen before. To be honest, any fan of the film should see it once, if for nothing else, the video quality and how beautifully redone it is. Can't wait for bloodlust in September!!! Hope this helps.",1440115200,2,950,4.254143646408839
7132541,2,B00WHZZAP6,No original 80s dub. Start including them with these new releases. The new dub is terrible and pretty much destroys the atmosphere the original dub gave it. Picture quality is the best it will be until another reissue comes along.,1439251200,5,230,4.775

Still, teenaged me had a higher regard for this than adult me, but teenaged me is still clutching this tight and refusing to let adult me give it up. Teenaged me is sensible like that.",1534896000,,280,4.403846153846154

To some it isn't an issue but I was originally introduced to most anime with the original voice dubs and I cant hear them with new voice overs. The new voices aren't very good and are too distracting, I couldn't even finish the movie before I just sold it.",1530576000,,366,4.318840579710145
