7960713,1,B0000648YS,"What you have is a Russian director trying to make a classic film of the era of Great Soviet Cinema by quoting scenes from various Great Soviet Films, without bothering much with plot or character depth.

The story is very loosely based on a real event during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, and a movie that hewed closer to the reality of that desperate prison revolt might have worked.

There are numerous realism howlers (like, underground caves in the arid Pakistani uplands dripping with water. That might have been a quote from Polish director Andrzej Wajda's <i>Kanal</a>, or it might have been from some Stalin-era piece). But they are as nothing compared to the script and direction that just do not work.

Strictly for genre completists.",1399766400,,748,4.866141732283465
7960714,4,B0000648YS,"The real event took place in old fortress of Badaber, Pakistan. I believe it was April of 1985. When several Soviet and Afghan prisoners, killed their rebel guards, and took control of the fortress and its armory. Afghan rebels, and their Pakistani counter parts tried to storm it, but were repelled, until finaly the armory blew up. Killing of the Soviet and Afghan prisoners, hundreds of Afghan rebels, Pakistani soldiers, and two to three American advisers. The movie itself wasn't too bad. Just remeber, it is a movie. Now, to my friends below, all you have to do is pay attention. Take a look at directors name, Soviet, Mi-24 helo, Soviet. Names of the actors are mostly Soviet. So, no deception there at all. So pay attention to the cover boys and girls, so you don't have to bitch about it later.",1187654400,3,803,4.661971830985915

This movie helped me research the current conditions in the war-torn country. It gives a lot of information on the POWs, and what it is like to be caught in the middle of it all.",1086220800,,281,4.423076923076923
