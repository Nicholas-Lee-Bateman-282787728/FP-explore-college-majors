8289592,1,B001CUB646,"Wow.
Saw this on cable and was 'flabbergasted' as to why *Midge* the reviewer would denounce anyone who claims this documentary is anything other than mere 'tripe'. Of course P.J. Corso was discredited by anyone that heard his 'report' (he was out to 'make-a-buck' after all).
The 'evidence' is simple speculation, as all these queries are, and merely point to an overactive imagination.
Of course the thought of extra terrestrial beings crash landing on Earth is 'exciting', but as others have pointed out: How can you travel millions of lightyears through the obstacles of space only to crash once you reach Earth. It's not only silly ---- it's Ludicrous.

Maybe you'll find some morsel of worth in this, but if you're looking for a good 'chuckle', just wait until they show it on television again.",1482796800,,800,4.925925925925926

8289595,5,B001CUB646,"Don't believe any jerk reviewer who tries to make light of Colonel Corso's book. The gov't sicks their jackals to discredit anyone who dares to speak the truth.

The Author was not only a highly respected colonel at the Pentagon, he was also in charge of an Army nuclear task force. After he retired, he worked for 2 senators who explicitly dealt with the funding & commissions which handled the DOD's most secret, highly classified projects with no less than a Q level, black project clearance.

Any boob in DC can tell you that generals do not do the footwork on any project. The colonel's are the one's who carry out the order. Remember, Colonel North? I have known several high echelon in the pentagon. Colonel Corso is for real. Everyone knew him to be an honest man & diligent about his duties & trusted with the highest of security clearances & positions in our gov't.

My father was at Ft. Riley. That's where the head of the Armies veterinary services was located and their last Cavalry. I knew the head of Veterinary services. He was a colonel too. That is exactly where an ebe would have been taken because the human doctors did not know enough to fully understand a body with a gizzard & skin like a gecko & eyes with outer membranes. Those are only found in reptiles & birds on our planet.  So, they rightfully sent the Roswell bodies to Ft. Riley veterinary services for an additional exam before shipping them to their final destinations. I knew this before Corso's book. Corso only substantiated that fact.

You can also go to the Navy's clementine lunar images where you can see structures on the moon for yourself if you look long enough. Most are on the right side & the southern area and mid to lower left side, and a few on the back. Some they tried to blur out but they are still there. Go see for yourself! I did. I followed up on Corso's info & found him to be 100% accurate.

This man placed his career & reputation on the line for your benefit  because he believed you were entitled to know the truth. He also died a year after he wrote this. That's what they do when you go public with black project secrets. The gov't makes the consequences quite clear when you receive your clearances.

Don't be an idiot by listening to morons and gov't jackals tasked with attacking his credibility & veracity to keep you in darkness. Corso was the gov'ts worst nightmare when he went public with their dark secret. Can you really be dumb enough not to listen to the most credible witness of all? You have had 3 opportunities to know the truth & yet you have allowed these jackals to attack each one. Don't blow your last chance. Corso's reputation & credibility are above reproach. For Once, believe him. He sacrificed everything to share this info with you.

I can also tell you from personal knowledge that anyone who worked for Bell Labs in the 60's & 70's all knew that Bell Labs had back engineered Roswell technology. It was common knowledge. We all knew about it.

Also, if you check the Nobel prize listings, you will find they awarded for the ""design of the manufacturing process to make Fiber-optics. Only the process to manufacture it."" (about 30 years after the fact) but they did not award the discovery of fiber-optics. The same goes for transistors which were the first item Bell labs back engineered.

If you thumb your nose at Corso, you don't deserve to know the truth.",1331424000,6,3402,4.542483660130719
