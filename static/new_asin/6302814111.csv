7832015,5,6302814111,"Cash and Carry - A somewhat dramatic departure for the stooges--at least, as far as the angle involving the handicapped kid and his older sister. Not that the stooges do bad with this angle, but I've always felt it was a bit heavy-handed. I'd rather not see the boys so altruistic--as I've said elsewhere, a little petty larceny and bending of the law by the stooges never hurts. At any rate, once the boys get to the old house they are back to their manic selves, complete with tools to beat each other with. 4 stars

No Census, No Feeling - Now we're talking. A short from Moe, Larry and Curly's peak period from the early to mid-40s and one of their best. Pretty much everything in this short is a winner--particularly the whole alum punch scene, which I later learned in life was actually inspired by an old ""Shemp Howard"" solo film. 5 stars

Some More of Samoa - Another very strong episode, again from the boys peak period. Love when the stooges and the old man get down with their ""Boogie Woogie Woogie"" dance and earlier when Symona Boniface and Mary Ainslee think the stooges have amputated the old man's leg. 4 1/2 stars

A great stooge collection....",1458777600,,1161,4.519047619047619

7832017,5,6302814111,"""Cash and Carry"" is one of the funniest movies ever.  I've watched this one many times and it always makes me laugh so hard I can hardly breath!  As my old friend said, ""be sure you have an oxygen tank handy when watching the Stooges"", and this one fits that statement perfectly.

This episode further proves that Curly is the funniest man who ever lived.",1114905600,,355,4.430769230769231
7832018,4,6302814111,"CASH AND CARRY takes away the excitement away from the rest of this great tape. I was disappointed that this short was too tender like for my likes. A little too uninteresting.
NO CENSUS, NO FEELING, on the other hand, was excellent. One of teh Stooges best shorts. The whole short is fast-paced from beginning to end. This was too funny.
SOME MORE OF SAMOA- Another great short. All sixteen minutes of this short is zany and hilarious. You have to see this.
I give this 4 stars.",1011571200,,479,4.454545454545454
7832019,4,6302814111,"CASH AND CARRY (1937) - For once in a few times, the boys actually show off their tenderhearted side in the scenes when they're helping out the crippled boy, Jimmy. While it's interesting, it seems very out of character for the Stooges. But fortunately, they go right back to being their manic selves when digging for gold in the old house. Overall, although not a very funny short, it is interesting to see the boys acting this way. Even the ending was pretty tender.
NO CENSUS, NO FEELING (1940) - A hilarious short, with great scenes, the best being the part where all the guests end up with puckered lips after drinking punch with powdered alum in it. The football scenes are hilarious as well.
SOME MORE OF SAMOA (1941) - Excellent film.  This is filled with zany, fast-paced gags from beginning to end, with perfect direction from Del Lord, excellent performances from the Stooges, and wonderful uses of sound effects. One of the Stooges' best.",994377600,2,950,4.72289156626506
