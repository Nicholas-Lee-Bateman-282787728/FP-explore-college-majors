8521229,4,B007R5OVTC,"Great movie worth seeing. It's so refreshing to not see any familiar actors - it's so easy to just see them as their characters. This movie is in German with English subtitles. It goes quickly so you need to read fast if you don't know German. I couldn't enjoy it as much visually since I had to keep my eyes on the bottom of the screen. Ironically, the music soundtrack is all in English!",1495584000,,389,4.27027027027027
8521230,5,B007R5OVTC,"The front of the package for this German-made indie calls it A Sleep Hit. I have to agree. I don't ever remember seeing it play in Philadelphia, where I live and came upon it, when I discovered the trailer.

I don't like spoilers and  if you are reading this, you obviously haven't seen the film  I won't spoil your discovery and enjoyment by telling you more than the minimum.

This is a coming-of-age film but with a cast of 20-somethings finding their place in the world. It could have been made in any major Western country and still told the same story. The film revolves around three mid-20 year old adults residing a care facility. Each has their own health issue. One guy has OCD, the girl has anorexia and the third (Vincent) has Tourette s syndrome (which causes him to uncontrollably go into spasms and spout graphic expletives). I only tell you this because the film is Not Rated and you should know that there will be many expletives in the film. Because it is in German, you won't recognize them but the clear, easy-to-read English subtitles will show them on the screen. There is no graphic violence or nudity in the film

Thats really all you need to know. If like independent films with superb acting by actors youve never seen before, I urge you to check it out. And the scenery (Germany and Italys mountain ranges) will certainly please your eyes.

The 95-minute film was made in 2010 and came to Home Video in 2012 but it has a new distributor (Film Movement) and is getting new distribution.
The front of the package says this is A Corinth Films Special Edition. I cant tell you why the edition is special  there are no bonus features besides the Trailer  but the film itself is special in the way it treats the story of three young adults trying to find their place in the world.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8521231,5,B007R5OVTC,"A heartwarming comedy-drama! ""Vincent will Meer"" (""Vincent Wants to Sea"" from 2010) is the story of a young man with Tourette's syndrome who has recently lost his mother and has an uneasy relationship with his father. Due to the severity of his condition, his father 'Robert' decides to send him to a specialized institution where he can receive professional care (the place didn't look all that bad either). Once there, 'Vincent' meets 'Alex' his new roommate (who suffers from OCD) and 'Marie' (an anorexic), and some very funny and awkward moments take place. Soon enough, the trio form an unlikely alliance and escape from the place in 'Doctor Rose's'  car and, the rest of the story becomes an adventure of discovery on the open road, with 'Robert' and 'Doctor Rose' tailing them the whole way! I don't want to give anymore away, so I'll just leave it there.

This is an actually very good and funny film, one can really sympathize with and care about these characters. Interestingly enough, for a European production it had more of a stateside feel to it. Probably because of the ""road movie"" theme (which has been done here a gazillion times), and the songs that were played over the action taking place. However, similarities aside; it had none of the clichs that abound in the Hollywood junk.

The cast was excellent: 'Vincent' Florian David Fitz, 'Marie' Karoline Herfurth, 'Alex' Johannes Allmayer, 'Robert' Heino Ferch, 'Dr. Rose'  Katharina Mller-Elmau, etc. Don't miss this funny and heartwarming film. The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent. NTSC, German (English subtitles), NR 96 mins.

Love and Peace,

8521233,5,B007R5OVTC,"Well done movie, which keeps moving with a natural flow and unexpected turns along the way.  It is as described in the reviews & description, and it leaves room for you to think about the story, life, and meanings.  Also has some nice scenery of Europe... Germany & Italy.

8521236,5,B007R5OVTC,"What a great story.  Vincent has a condition that makes him blurt out profanity in public.  His mother dies and his father puts him in a home for people with certain conditions.  Vincent has the ashes from him mother and with the help of 2 people in the home they  escape and stealing a car. They are  on a journey to spread the ashes in the sea.  This starts the best part of the story in which the trio run into all sorts of roadblocks, even some including his father.  This is a movie that I would suggest young teens watch.  It shows that no matter what condition or disabilities you have you are a human being and want to enjoy life.  It is in English subtitles.  It has been at many film festivals and has won awards.",1366588800,2,723,4.173913043478261
