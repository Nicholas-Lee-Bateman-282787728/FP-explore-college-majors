8111583,4,B000ENEFIG,"A nice 2005 Chicago White Sox Championship documentary. Presentation is well put together by Comcast focusing on key season moments and highlights as well as playoffs narrated by Ken ""The Hawk"" Harrelson. Current season got you down? Let this DVD cheer you up and Relive the 2005 season all over again an absolute must for diehard White Sox fans,",1457654400,,346,4.88135593220339

8111586,5,B000ENEFIG,"A perfect surprise for a White Sox Fan. Fun, as it allows a fan who lives far away to enjoy the excitement of the success of the team. A great gift.",1398124800,,148,3.806451612903226
8111587,4,B000ENEFIG,"There are two highlight DVD's for the White Sox in 2005. One is the World Series 2005 released by the MLB official and the other is this. The major difference between these two is that this one is more focused on the regular season while the other one is focused on the postseason. So they are complements for each other.

The special feature in this DVD is also worth mentioning. It has an introduction to the players. This is what you can see on the big screen before the game starts in the home ballpark. Another special feature is the '59 Go Go Sox song with the footage. It is not easy to grab this song on the website and I am glad they put it here. Some of Sox advertisements on TV are also collected here. The parade for the Sox and another compact highlight film are in the fourth and last.

I am glad I have both of the DVD's. It is always delightful to watch the 2005 White Sox film. I think White Sox fans will love it and put this DVD in their collections.",1174003200,10,969,4.148936170212766
8111588,5,B000ENEFIG,"I was fortunate to attend the premiere of this DVD back in December at the Arie Crown Theater (as well as have my picture taken with the World Series trophy!!!), and it was well worth making the trip back to Chicago.  This is an awesome DVD covering the entire 2005 White Sox season from Spring Training, their amazing start out of the gate, interleague highlights, their dominance heading into August, facing a nerve-wracking late season challenge from the Cleveland Indians, ultimately ending the regular season on a winning note which carried over throughout a stunning and memorable post-season.  The presentation is centered around the Sox's successul ""GRINDER RULES"" marketing concept, longtime White Sox broadcaster Hawk Harrelson provides the narration, and there are interview clips featuring White Sox fans sprinkled throughout (one of whom was also featured in the Major League Baseball ""I Love This Game!"" commercials which aired during the post-season).  Because this DVD covers the full season, it's a wonderful companion to the 2005 World Series DVD; a few portions of highlights and player interviews actually appear in both DVDs, but there's nothing wrong with that at all.  DVD bonus features include the scoreboard presentation that appeared as the White Sox took the field in Game 2 of the World Series (the music from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was not used, however fans will be happy to hear AC/DC's ""THUNDERSTRUCK"" as the players are introduced), the scoreboard video for ""Let's Go Go-Go White Sox"" by Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers (mixing 1959 and current highlights), a month-by-month highlight feature (which appeared during the victory parade and rally), various highlights from the parade (small clips instead of a full presentation, but still very nice), and a collection of White Sox GRINDER RULES ads from throughout the season.  White Sox fans have been starved for a championship for nearly a century, and this DVD (along with the World Series DVD and the box set) are worthy keepsakes from a thrilling season of White Sox baseball.",1145750400,6,2070,5.18562874251497
8111589,4,B000ENEFIG,"This is an excellent keepsake for all true Sox fans and even tag-alongs.

If you love baseball and know the essence of the true game as it should be played, then this is the DVD for you.

SOX PRIDE chronicles the 2005 Chicago White Sox season from pillar to post, from Spring Training to the World Series Parade and Rally in the greatest city on earth.

Narrated by Sox TV announcer Hawk Harrelson, the DVD especially focuses on the regular season, one of the most exciting ever.  This aspect of the season is not as thoroughly covered by the World Series DVD.

The coverage of the World Series games themselves is very brief, perhaps the only fault with this DVD.

The Bonus Features section is very good too, containing the ""Grinder Rules"" advertisements, music-enhanced extra highlights and other brief nuggets.

SOX PRIDE is the perfect companion to the World Series highlights DVD, if not superior in most regards.

Way to go Comcast!

Even Cubs fans might like this DVD, as it portrays a reality that they can only dream of...

HA-HA!  We got there first!!!!",1142467200,2,1064,4.697297297297298
