7888806,5,6305417504,"What is one to say that hasn't been said before about Bill Fields work? Just buy it, view it and enjoy it. What a character! I always feel better after watching him go through his polished routine even as my sides are splitting.

I wish that I could find a video copy of the pool exhibition he did in the mid-1940's for the troops, his last. Anyone know where to look?
