7545550,5,B018ENE3G6,"The full series is finally available on DVD. (There are other unofficial DVD sets, so don't be fooled.) Samurai Pizza Cats is one of my favorite shows and still holds up quite well. The entire 52 episode series is here, including episodes that weren't shown in all regions. If you used to watch the show, it's quite possible there are episodes here you haven't seen yet. As an added bonus, the episode previews are included through episode 20. It's a great set that fans will be sure to appreciate.",1374192000,7,498,4.606741573033708

7545553,4,B018ENE3G6,"I would give it 5 stars but I took off because the Blu-ray is setup pretty lazy. There are no subtitles or extras. Just 52 episodes all on one blu-ray. The show is in standard  definition and you will have to turn your TV up almost all the way. Other that that, pizza cats is a nostalgic throwback and thus should be picked up by all Anime and morning cartoon lovers. Doesn't get any better than this.",1460246400,2,401,4.207792207792208
7545554,3,B018ENE3G6,"The quality was a bit off, blocky in places, and some damage still showed from the originals, probably something to do with the mastering process. It also cuts audio in spots.",1456099200,,175,4.67741935483871

7545556,4,B018ENE3G6,"I will at least buy this so that I can have a fresh copy of the show.  The reason I gave the product such a high rating is because the show in itself deserves it.  The decision of Saban and his crew to throw in their own dialogue was pure genius!  It reminds me of Mystery Science Theater 3000 heckling Japanese movies, accept the Samurai Pizza Cat characters heckle each other, the script writers, the narrator, etc.  It was a daring move by Saban because I would assume that it was the first time anyone in america had taken a Japanese cartoon and dubbed in totally original lines.  It was a gamble that payed off in my opinion because it gave the characters their own special identity and charm for american audiences.  Also the puns, alliterations, and Francine's rhymes, are a lot of fun to listen to. This show is a splendid example of how you can be outlandish, and yet avoid  being vulgar or flagrant.  I can understand why this doesn't have English subtitles.  Since the show has an ad lib style, there is a vast amount of vocabulary words thrown around.  It would be a lot of work, but worth it because it is a fun way to learn a lot of words.  That is why I will not give this product five stars.  English subtitles would have made it more enjoyable because there are ""so many"" words flowing out of the dictionary, I don't always catch every word.",1454198400,5,1358,4.366533864541832
7545557,3,B018ENE3G6,"I was hoping that it is a nostalgic animation in Japan, but unfortunately, the audio does not contain Japanese.

7545559,2,B018ENE3G6,"One of the worst dubs ever made but some people think that it falls into the ""so bad it's good"" category.  Personally I disagree having watched some of this back when it first aired.  There was really no attempt to translate the Japanese script and the so called ""translators"" from Saban just made up their own story and jokes to fit the action on the screen at the time.  I do admit that the JP original is rather generic but in my opinion the show is better off this way. Look up the Kyatto Ninden Teyandee DVDs, read a few subtitles and leave this alone unless they make uncut blurays",1453507200,,587,4.318181818181818
7545560,3,B018ENE3G6,"I pre-ordered this because the listing basically says it is the Japanese version of the show. I was expecting Japanese with subtitles. Turns out this is not in Japanese, it does not have the Japanese story lines, and there are no subtitles. I'm mostly likely going to return this as the English version, with the made up stories and adlibbing, was not what I was looking forward to receiving.",1453334400,3,392,4.695652173913044

7545562,5,B018ENE3G6,"This DVD collection is everything that I had hoped it would be. I watched this show in the early 90's, and have been waiting ever since to own a copy, so when I saw this item for sale I was suspicious that it might not be a legitimate version. This is not the case; all episodes are there in good quality, and I recommend this to any Samurai Pizza Cat fan.",1383436800,,356,4.028169014084507
7545563,5,B018ENE3G6,"More or less Samurai Pizza Cats is a parody of it's Japanese counter part Kyatto Ninden Teyandee. If you don 't know by now, essentially when Saban went to translate, they didn't have complete scripts and the cultural references would have been lost entirely. Which lead to the production company to basically write their own scripts and re-edit the show in various ways, what you have is a very entertaining random result.

While the pop-culture reference are obviously dated, the overall humor (oh the jokes that flew over my head when I first watched it's initial run), slapstick and sarcasm (don't let the cute look of the show fool you) hold up entirely well. The image quality is pretty good overall, a little clipping here and there due to the tapes but, that's to be expect from age. The audio is great. Only downside is there really isn't anything in terms of bonus content, but there's not much to go on anyhow.

Overall, great show and great dvd set thanks to Discotek.",1378252800,,980,4.691860465116279
7545564,5,B018ENE3G6,"Quick note. The release is very great and all, however, this is not the first time the series made it to DVD in a dub. When a publisher releases a T.V. series it's a marketing game and if no one is buying, they will stop producing copies. So, to prevent having to watch this possibly end up out of print and marked up 50% in a year: BUY IT NOW! You won't regret it!

Indeed this an absolute wonder to finally see a release. I wasn't watching it as a kid when the franchise was first introduced, I first found fan-subbed episodes when I was in middle school. There were a couple of websites back around that time(2000-02) that were demanding the release of Samurai Pizza Cats on VHS(as DVDs were not as affordable at the time). I've noticed in the reviews how someone pointed out the fact that there wasn't an audio commentary. Why would you need an audio commentary of the English voice actors? They would tell you the same thing they've told others, which is, the transcripts were sketchy and had to be pushed towards Western humor. The original Japanese gags and jokes were not something that Western audiences were familiar with. They are similar to what the English translators substituted, in a way. The original jokes in Japanese were in regards to Japanese pop-culture and development at the time. The English substitutes with very funny 90's pop-cultural references which doesn't take away from the intent of the anime.

On a funny note, I'm sure most know that the Paul Lynde impersonator who sings the opening song was drunk during the recording and stutters a few times.",1378252800,,1581,4.642857142857143
7545565,5,B018ENE3G6,"During the Eighties when Saban and DIC Entertainment was importing animation from Japan and France, Saban brought forth an animation about biomechanical, anthropomorphic felines who stop evil while running a Pizza Shop.  Thus the makings for Samurai Pizza Cats.  Originally something a bit different in Japan, Saban re-edited the show, poking fun at pop culture references, inside jokes and other aspects which made this a rare to find show for DVD.

Taking place in the mythical Little Tokyo, the Pizza Cats are constantly foiling threats from the Big Cheese and Bad Bird.  Whereas also contending with the scat-loving Emperor Fred, the demanding Princess Vi, not to mention the emotionally, rocket-launching, Lucille.

The show has all 52 episodes on it.  Which is great, considering the fact Saban had problems with syndicated networks shuffling round the show at odd schedules (Strangely I only recall the first ten episodes).  My only beef with the collection is the fact the Japanese counterpart is sold separately.  Mainly because it would've been nice if they had either combined them into one collection, or perhaps add a few episodes as a bonus feature.

Other than that, Samurai Pizza Cats is definitely a great purchase for any Toon aficionado.  If you love Dynaman, or Power Rangers, you'll love this cartoon show.",1377993600,3,1327,5.187793427230047
7545566,5,B018ENE3G6,The show is just like I remember and is something a fan of the pizza cat should get.  It also has the episodes that never aired on u.s.a TV.,1377993600,,140,3.8275862068965516
7545567,5,B018ENE3G6,"Purchased this as soon as I saw it and I am happy with this collection. the only thing that make me a bit mad is the fact that amazon dropped the price so soon, I paid $80 and as soon as I get it in the mail it drops to $50. I could have bought more from amazon with the extra $30, but no I paid the full retail. Maybe I can get some money back but I really doubt it. Still this is an amazing dvd collection and if you grew up with the show I say buy it now!

*Edit - Found out that Amazon refunds the difference if the price drops and if you call them within 30 days of purchase. So now I can say all is good and this product still rocks, so what are you waiting for buy this dvd set asap!",1376092800,,690,3.6621621621621623
7545568,5,B018ENE3G6,Samurai Pizza Cats a funny classic comedy anime from the great 90's era. I remember watching this a few times as a kid and now I can rewatch it as an adult and catch up on episodes I missed.,1375401600,3,190,3.8974358974358974
7545569,5,B018ENE3G6,"Ok so... I watched this as a kid, my first favorite anime sort-of, series. I loved the robots every episode. So I found out Discotek got the licence and I honestly.. never heard of them.. But they promised a remastered, cleaned up series...

I just got my disc set, and here is my review

Arrived safely, prepackaged in security wrap and seal, all disks accounted for an in perfect condition.

Audio: Clear, crisp, perfect!

Video: Now here's where we get tricky... In this digital bluray world of ours ,with our high def dvd players and monitors, mine is a 1080p Samsung monitor on my pc for example, we are used to crisp clear perfection as created by major studios. However, this was created way before that, and Discotek has done a perfect job with this. There is a slight bit of distortion or static, like cartoons used to have back then, but other than that fuzz that's barely noticeable, the picture is as crisp as you can get from the 90's. Coloring is beautiful, black and edges are great. No complaints here.

DO NOT EXPECT perfect video, its remastered from the 90's. But its as good as you'll get it.

I wish diskotek to make a bluray, high def version of this series, like .. perfect graphics... if that was even possible... Lucas did it! Why cant they?

They delivered a wonderfull set.

Audio: 9-10 / 10
Video: 8-10/10

Is it worth $80 you may ask? I purchased it for half that on a sale, but YES IT IS WORTH IT!

Considering you get the ENTIRE SERIES, not season 1, or 2, or 3, which would be like $29.99 each after it was done with.. No, you get the 52 episodes released and aired. There was 54, but the last 2 were clip shows, so no big deal there.

VERDICT!

Pros: I waited 23 YEARS for this moment, and it was made perfect!

Cons: NO BONUS MATERIALS, SUBTITLES, AUDIO COMMENTARY (If it existed) or show of how they remastered it. No bonus anything. This is my ONE and ONLY complaint. Not even a PICTURE BOOK inside either!

Doesn't matter, because I have my precioussss now!

Buy it, don't question, buy it! Or wait for a sale! Bless you discotek!",1375228800,,2067,4.41688654353562
7545570,5,B018ENE3G6,"So I pre-order this straight from the company who is releasing this on July 30. To my surprise, the set showed up at my door 12 days early. I have had a chance to get through the first disk. When I heard the opening song, memories began to flash in my mind. Excellent feeling I had. When the show started it is as to be expected from a Discotek release. Original straight product. No updated mastering nor clean up work done on the DVDs. That makes it feel so much better. The jokes are still as funny and entertaining. I forgot how wonderful the show can appeal to all ages. I now watch this before I head off to my morning formation in the army. Waking up early is still a pain, but now I have a smile on my face. Thankyou",1374192000,5,724,4.105633802816901

8742208,2,B018ENE3G6,"I love the show, but some of the episodes are flickering too much and makes it unwatchable.

8742212,5,B018ENE3G6,"A classic cartoon on blu ray with 50+ episodes. What's amazing is this blu ray is programmed to remember where you left off last, so when you put the disc back in or start up your blu ray player, it continues with the episode you were on.

8742213,3,B018ENE3G6,"The problem with this collection is the sound. The picture is good, but we had the sound pumped up to max and could still barely hear it. There were moments of loudness, but for the most part it was so quiet it was difficult to enjoy fully.",1473120000,,240,4.127659574468085
8742214,4,B018ENE3G6,"The video quality is basically the same as the DVD release, but you get the added convenience of having only one disc to deal with. I'm including a couple screenshots, but I suspect Amazon will re-compress them, making the minor difference between them unnoticeable. Interestingly, they used freeware tools to encode the video for both releases: HCEnc for DVD and x264 for BD.

1 star off due to the tinkering they did to the video master that was used to produce both the DVD and this Blu-ray. The image overall has a ""processed"" look to it, with some trailing (after-images) resulting from noise reduction used to smear away analog video noise and whatever they did to tame dot crawl. Occasionally there are blended frames and residual combing from their attempt to convert the 29.97 interlaced videotapes back to 23.976 film rate. I'd prefer they just left it alone, but it isn't too bad.",1466294400,,891,4.823529411764706
