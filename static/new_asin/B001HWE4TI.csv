8309868,5,B001HWE4TI,Excellent set of videos for both someone just starting out in blacksmithing and for the intermediate smith looking to expand on new techniques. It's a lot easier to learn these techniques by watching a video rather than reading a book.,1412467200,,235,4.9
8309869,5,B001HWE4TI,This DVD was very well done and easy to follow Randy does a wonderful job. I was able to improve skills I already had and learn new ones. If you are just starting blacksmithing or been at it for awhile you can learn from this DVD. Worth the money.,1378857600,,247,4.061224489795919
