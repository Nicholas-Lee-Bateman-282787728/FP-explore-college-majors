8364248,5,B002CLKOW4,"In Religulous, Bill Maher was on a satirical quest to find God and understand religion while laughing at the extraordinary claims by the religious. The advertising guru, Simon Cole, took a completely different approach in his documentary film So Help Me God. It's not a comedy, but rather it is a drama - portraying a real spiritual quest to find God.

Instead of laughing at the religious and what they say, he listened and asked questions trying to understand God. Going from one religion to another, from one denomination to another, he begins to realize that the question is not only where God is, but who's God is the right one. Everyone is convinced their God is the one, but how can you truly believe it if there are so many religions in the world?

It was delightful when occasional, genuine humor would distract you from the truth. While talking to Presbyterians about homosexuals one of the older guys, probably in his 70 said, ""Don't you love that all these fundamentalists quote the King James Version; and he was as queer as three dollar bill."" You can't help but laugh.

If you want something refreshing, something personal, and powerful - watch So Help Me God. As an atheist you will see religion from a different perspective and as a theist you will enjoy Simon's search for God. It's very healthy to search for the unknown as it takes courage, especially when the unknown defies the mainstream status quo.

A personal master piece that will leave your mind in a deep thought contemplating about your own spiritual state of mind. You owe it to yourself to watch it.",1248220800,8,1581,4.696750902527076
