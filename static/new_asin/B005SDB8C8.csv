8484862,5,B005SDB8C8,"Filmed in Brooklyn in 2004, the first volume of ""The Found Footage Festival"" is a portent of things to come. It was an idea of pure genius from hosts Joe Pickett and Nick Prueher to compile and edit hundreds of hours of the most eclectic industrial, safety, and promotional videos along with cable access TV and found movies from places like Goodwill, flea markets, etc., into an hour and a half of riotous entertainment, although be forewarned there are couple of rather ghastly bits.

The DVD allows you to view it as a live show complete with audience reactions and their introductions and comments, or as individual clips. I like it best with the audience participation. The show opens with the video that started it all: ""McDonald's Inside and Outside Custodial Duties"", which may not sound entertaining (but if you think that you just haven't seen ""McC"".) Following that dynamic opening is one of the most painfully astonishing pieces of footage ever seen, starring a longsuffering sheriff and a cat named Pinky who was the ""pet of the week"" adoptable. I'm still trying to work out who was most traumatized by the episode.

In the self-promotional vanity project category, there is an unforgettable autobiographical piece called ""Corey Haim: Me, Myself, and I"". See him play hockey! See him wear horrible clothes! See him play the keyboards in a ghastly, unmusical way! Finally, learn how he answers the question ""What does kissing mean to me""?

I normally don't particularly enjoy religious humor, but must say that ""Religious Showdown"" is priceless. The duel between a religious comedian (never a great idea) and a cable access preacher, Wayne Brian Meyer is absolutely stunning. (The poster rolling scene clinches it for Meyer in my mind!) Following that is hard, but ""Potpourri"" is up next and is a very uncomfortable blend of a bad Minnesota beauty pageant (Featuring not one, but two women dressed as cows!), catfish skinning (This is genuinely disturbing and is the one thing I really wish was not in the mix here; yes, the catfish are alive in the beginning and it is brutal.), and a prosthetic ED aid video that is positively guaranteed to shock and dismay the unwary. Be very afraid!

Home shopping networks are always a treasure trove of horrible production values, but nothing can prepare you for the manic sales pitches awaiting you from ""The John and Johnny Show"" on America's Value Network. This is off the charts obnoxious and completely bonkers.

One of the best bits in the show (and an oft-repeated trope in future installments) is the ""Exercise Video Montage"" which features loads of insane workouts to include Traci Lords rapping (Sample lyric: ""Kicking for this leg group, come on baby, please don't poop!"" Don't believe me? Watch it!)  I appreciate Traci trying to put her sordid past behind her, but you'll definitely see how she worked out for her starring roles. For something that's not exercise masquerading as a workout, try ""Chair Aerobics"", and if that leaves you wanting something a little more strenuous, try Zsa Zsa Gabor's ""It's Simple Darling"" workout. This segment is worth the price of admission alone.

It's hard to follow Zsa Zsa, but Prueher and Pickett come through spectacularly with a Jan Terri musical montage. If you don't know who Jan Terri is and you have an interest in this DVD, you need to do some research right now. The hosts correctly note that Jan has a hard time pronouncing the letter ""R"", and the video for ""Journey to Mars"" is a highlight, though ""Get Down Goblin"" was the song that stuck in my head and I wasn't the only one (""I know I'm going to be humming 'Get Down Goblin' the rest of the night; it happens every time!"")

""Memorial Day 2000"" is a found footage video showing the worst behavior imaginable at a campsite. (""Burn the couch!"") I was mostly just annoyed by these awful people.

The show concludes with a fan favorite: Jack Rebney, the world's angriest RV salesman. Jack sells Winnebagos and has an anger management problem; believe it or not this clip made him so famous there is now a documentary about him called ""Winnebago Man"". This is the stuff of legend.

The DVD doesn't stop there, though, as there are several extras all of which range from odd (The Smothers Brothers ""Just Say Yo"" yo-yo instructional video) to otherworldly (a line dancing video called ""Diane Horner's Country Hip Hop"".) There's also a couple of bonus rap videos, most notably from the old gentleman who used to be the Menard's spokesman rapping about double hung windows (!) but most embarrassingly from a UW-Eau Claire student on the college's network. Our tax dollars at work, people.

""The Found Footage Festival: Volume 1"" is a goldmine of bizarre and untold comic genius, hosted perfectly by Prueher and Pickett. If you are a fan of the unusual or find humor in everyday peculiarities, this is a must-see DVD and I recommend it unreservedly. (Catfish excepted.)",1450656000,,4925,4.865155131264917

8484865,4,B005SDB8C8,"Upon receiving The Found Footage Festival 1 & 2, I was unsure what awaited me. Being a bit of a film guy, I tend to be more interested in the weird and wonderful world of cinema. These DVD's fit both of those criteria, being extremely weird and wonderful. Oh, and funny as hell!

So the premise is simple. Two guys digging up the weirdest offerings in videos that were never made for public consumption. Whether that is an unbelievably low budget and poorly produced Mcdonald's custodial video. To the joys of public access and regional home shopping networks. The segment called John and Johnny had me in stitches. These guys either really love selling junk on TV, or they are on drugs. No one should be that excited about $8 sunglasses. Even lost and forgotten home videos make their way into the festival like the hilarious Kurt's 40th, or the ominous and unsettling Memorial Day 2000, which the host aptly describe as a fun weekend that quickly devolves into ""lord of the flies like debauchery"". This collection is also where the infamous video of the ""Winnebago Man"", Jack Rebney, was unearthed. If you are not familiar with this video, it has since gone viral and spawned and entire feature length documentary.

No review would be complete without at least alluding to an Arnold Schwarzenegger feature in Rio. WOW. I'm sure the Governator is less that proud of this one. Celebs like the late Corey Haim, and Alyssa Milano also have some buried pasts here, and understandably so.

I have now had multiple viewings of each volume, and I continue to be entertained. It's Great for a laugh with friends, or good conversational background to a cocktail party. The Segments are fairly short, appealing to even the shortest attention spans. The video segments are available to watch as discovered, but I highly recommend the ""play all"" feature, which includes a sort of ""narration"" from the festival founders. The commentary is insightful as to the source of the video as well as adding some spot on commentary, which is often as funny as the videos themselves.

If you have a background in film you will really appreciate the awful instructional videos, and in-house-only promotional videos. I will issue a small warning regarding some very brief, and unsettling, male nudity and a lot of bad language. If either offends your sensibilities you may want to avoid this.

Don't leave your home movies in the camcorder or lose them at a garage sale. You may find yourself on display in the next installment of The Found Footage Festival. I personally can't wait.",1327017600,2,2558,4.831050228310502
