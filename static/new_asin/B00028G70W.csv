8023893,2,B00028G70W,I bought this for a Christmas present. It wasn't exactly what was described and the case was dirty and cracked. I was almost embarrassed to give this to my mom as a gift.,1477440000,,170,4.181818181818182

8023895,4,B00028G70W,"A prior customer review on 4/13/07 by Eric Huffstutler stated that this DVd included a highly sought Minnie the Moocher cartoon. This was the main reason that we ordered this DVD. When we rec'd it today, it did NOT have the cartoon Minnie the Moocher on it! I am very diappointed. Every cartoon that is on this DVD is also included on the 42 cartoon 2-disc collection (which we also purchased!), so I wasted my money purchasing a duplicate.",1362614400,5,440,4.582278481012659
8023896,2,B00028G70W,"This is not the product advertised.  Amazon is not the only listing like this, though:  have ordered this, with front and back-cover play-list scans, etc., et al., from others as well, only to receive the same package.  This contains Crazy invention, candid candidate, ding dong doggie, hot air salesman, is my palm read?, judge for a day, a language all my own, a little soap and water, rhythm on the Reservation,  training pigeons, we did it, ker-choo, indoor outing, little nobody, & making friends.",1261612800,4,502,4.940476190476191
8023897,5,B00028G70W,"Why does Betty Boop seem indelibly etched in our memories as solidly as Barbie and hot dogs?  She never existed but she's larger than life.  She gets rediscovered by generations again and again and probably always will.  The lesser known actress who did her voice probably never did anything quite so long lasting or important.  She amazes.  She's up there with Marilyn and Kennedy--legends all.  If you're a fan, these little sets of cartoons are probably the closest to the original thing (not restored to death)that you'll find.",1245628800,,531,4.9772727272727275
8023898,3,B00028G70W,This is a great gift for a Betty Boop fan... doubt if anyone else would really be interested.,1200787200,,93,4.222222222222222
8023899,3,B00028G70W,"Considering that Betty Boop cartoons are over 70-years old, they look good for their age (including Betty).  Most versions we see today were edited for television to meet morality code standards and distributed by U. M. & M. TV Corp.  The cartoons themselves were mostly Paramount releases.  Betty ran between 1931-1939 and several titles have fell into public domain though Viacom is supposed to be the official owner of Betty.

What you get on this disc is a mixed bag of 11 cartoons but does include the elusive and highly sought after ""Minnie The Moocher"".  The down side is that the Platinum Disc intro plays before each and every cartoon even if you select ""play all"".  And they have a watermark that comes up periodically that isn't overly distracting but befuddles me as to why they do this when all here are basically public domain titles?  Transfer quality is normal for Betty cartoons with no restoration.

Titles include: She Wronged Him Right / BB & Grampy / Minnie the Moocher / Musical Mountaineers / Stop That Noise / Swat The Fly / BB & The Little King / Happy You and Merry Me / House Cleaning Blues / The Impractical Joker / BB & Little Jimmy.

There was a Republic VHS and Laser Disc release long out of print that included all of Betty's titles but rights have switch hands and no news about a DVD set containing unedited versions any time soon from Paramount or any other outfit.",1176422400,8,1401,4.594377510040161
